the arabidopsis protein delay of germination _PROTEIN_ is a key regulator of seed dormancy which is a life history trait that determines the timing of seedling emergence . the amount of _PROTEIN_ protein in freshly harvested seeds determines their dormancy level . _PROTEIN_ has been identified as a major dormancy qtl and variation in _PROTEIN_ transcript levels between accessions contributes to natural variation for seed dormancy . the _PROTEIN_ gene is alternatively spliced . alternative splicing increases the transcriptome and proteome diversity in higher eukaryotes by producing transcripts that encode for proteins with altered or lost function . it can also generate tissue specific transcripts or affect mrna stability . here we suggest a different role for alternative splicing of the _PROTEIN_ gene . _PROTEIN_ produces five transcript variants encoding three protein _METHOD_ . transgenic _PROTEIN_ mutant seeds _PROTEIN_ single _PROTEIN_ transcript variants from the endogenous _PROTEIN_ promoter did not complement because they were non dormant and lacked _PROTEIN_ protein . however transgenic plants overexpressing single _PROTEIN_ variants from the promoter could accumulate protein and showed complementation . simultaneous _PROTEIN_ of two or more _PROTEIN_ transcript variants from the endogenous _PROTEIN_ promoter also led to increased dormancy levels and accumulation of _PROTEIN_ protein . this suggests that single _METHOD_ are functional but require the presence of additional _METHOD_ to prevent protein degradation . subsequently we found that the _PROTEIN_ protein can bind to itself and that this binding is required for _PROTEIN_ function but not for protein accumulation . natural variation for _PROTEIN_ binding efficiency was observed among arabidopsis accessions and contributes to variation in seed dormancy .
the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ gene contains three exons . its second intron is alternatively spliced and shows both alternative and alternative splice site selection leading to four different transcripts _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . we quantified the individual transcripts using specific primers . comparison of total _PROTEIN_ transcript levels with the combined levels of the four individual splicing _METHOD_ indicated that the majority of _PROTEIN_ transcript does not exist out of these four _METHOD_ . detailed analysis of the _PROTEIN_ transcripts by _PROTEIN_ revealed the presence of a fifth splicing form encoding the same protein as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which was designated as _PROTEIN_ . this splicing form misses the complete third exon . schematic representation

variants was followed during seed maturation . as shown previously _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ peaks in the middle of the seed maturation phase and is reduced in fully mature dry seeds . the _PROTEIN_ transcript represents about of the _PROTEIN_ transcripts at the measured time points . the ratio between the different splicing _METHOD_ is fairly constant although _PROTEIN_ is relatively more abundant at the beginning of seed maturation . _PROTEIN_ is very low abundant but increases at the end of seed maturation . the alternative splicing of _PROTEIN_ only affects the c terminal part of the protein . _PROTEIN_ is the smallest isoform _LOCATION_ accession and shares nearly the complete protein sequence with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ apart from its last nine amino acids . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins are longer respectively and amino acids in ler and share their last amino acids with each other . the cellular localisation of the three _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was analysed by transient _PROTEIN_ of their n terminal yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion proteins in nicotiana benthamiana leaves . all three fusion proteins were _PROTEIN_ detected in the _LOCATION_ similar as previously shown in transgenic arabidopsis seeds containing _METHOD_ fused with the _PROTEIN_ genomic fragment . these results were confirmed by transformation of arabidopsis protoplasts with c terminal _METHOD_ fusion proteins of the three _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the presence of all three _PROTEIN_ protein _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ suggests that they are able to meet each other . the near isogenic line _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ contains an introgression of a strong _PROTEIN_ allele from the cape verde islands accession in the ler background and has a high level of seed dormancy . in contrast the _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ does not produce full length _PROTEIN_ protein and is nondormant . the function of the three _PROTEIN_ protein _METHOD_ was studied by complementation of the _PROTEIN_ mutant with single _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ driven by the native _PROTEIN_ promoter . transgenic plants with single insertion events were obtained . none of these showed convincing functional complementation as their seed dormancy level was comparable to that of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . only introduction of _PROTEIN_ caused a very weak restoration of dormancy . therefore single _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ appeared largely non functional when _PROTEIN_ from a native _PROTEIN_ promoter . germination profiles of control lines single double and triple _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_

. an asterisk on the left of the top panel shows molecular _METHOD_ marker around kd . the _PROTEIN_ mutant produces only truncated protein and serves as a negative control . individual line names were indicated at the bottom for and . the line colours beneath the transgenic line names correspond to the line colours in . subsequently transgenic plants with single _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were mutually crossed and or plants homozygous for two _METHOD_ were selected for all possible combinations . transgenic lines containing two _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed enhanced dormancy compared to lines containing a single _PROTEIN_ isoform . although dormancy levels of these double transformants showed variation we observed the tendency that plants containing a combination of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ had higher dormancy levels than plants containing a combination of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which germinated already directly after harvest . the dormancy level of double transgenic plants containing _PROTEIN_ as one of the two splicing _METHOD_ was similar to that of the low dormant ler accession but much lower than nil _PROTEIN_ which is the wild type background of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . finally we obtained transgenic plants that contain all three _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ after further crossing and selection . seeds of all these triple transgenic plants showed dormancy restoration and none of them had similar low dormancy levels as the double transgenic lines containing and . seed dormancy highly correlates with _PROTEIN_ transcript and protein levels in freshly harvested seeds . therefore transcript and protein levels were measured in the single double and triple transgenic plants . freshly harvested seeds of the transgenic lines showed some variation in their _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but were mostly in a similar range as those of nil _PROTEIN_ . this was to be expected because _PROTEIN_ is transcribed from the same _PROTEIN_ promoter in nil _PROTEIN_ and the transgenic lines . the transcript levels of the transgenes are expected to be slightly lower than the observed _PROTEIN_ transcript levels which include a low amount of transcript from the _PROTEIN_ mutant gene . taken this into account transcript levels in the transgenic lines still did not correlate with dormancy levels . several of the transgenic lines with single _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed high _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels comparable to nil _PROTEIN_ but were non dormant . in contrast dormancy correlated with _PROTEIN_ protein accumulation in these transgenic seeds . _PROTEIN_ protein was scarcely detectable in the transgenic lines containing single _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in accordance with their lack of seed dormancy . the double and triple transgenic lines accumulated varying levels of _PROTEIN_ protein that were mostly in the same range as those found in seeds of the ler accession but much lower compared to the wild type nil _PROTEIN_ . interestingly the double transgenic lines accumulated slightly higher levels of _PROTEIN_ protein than the triple although they were less dormant . this suggests that the presence of three _METHOD_ gives higher _PROTEIN_ activity in comparison to two _METHOD_ . in the double and triple transformants that contain both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ protein two bands could be detected . in the non transgenic controls however only the faster migrating band is visible which corresponds to the _PROTEIN_ protein . this is most likely due to the different ratio of the _PROTEIN_ transcript variants between controls and transgenic lines . in the double and triple transformants the different _PROTEIN_ transcript variants are _PROTEIN_ at similar levels whereas in the wild type the transcripts that encode the _PROTEIN_ protein are most abundant . as _PROTEIN_ protein accumulates to higher levels in nil _PROTEIN_ compared to the double and triple transgenic lines despite their comparable transcript levels the ratio between the _METHOD_ probably influences _PROTEIN_ protein accumulation . we were interested whether an increase in the transcript level of single _PROTEIN_ transcripts could lead to complementation of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . three constructs with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ driven by the constitutive promoter were separately transformed into _PROTEIN_ plants . about to of the obtained independent transformants for all three constructs showed high levels of seed dormancy . interestingly the _PROTEIN_ isoform was most effective in dormancy induction followed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed relatively lower dormancy levels . overall this experiment demonstrated that every _PROTEIN_ isoform is biochemically functional to induce seed dormancy . germination

. the top left graph shows the values for the controls and non complementing transformant lines . details are described in the legend of . both complementing and non complementing lines for all three constructs were selected for further analysis . comparison of _PROTEIN_ transcript levels between these lines showed a more than fold difference . high levels of _PROTEIN_ transcript were only detected in lines with high dormancy levels . consistent with the transcript levels _PROTEIN_ protein could only be detected in the dormant transformants where it accumulated to even higher levels than in the nil _PROTEIN_ control . taken together with the results from the complementation experiments using the native _PROTEIN_ promoter these data suggest that all the single _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are functional but unstable in the cell and can only accumulate when they have very high transcript levels . overlapping _LOCATION_ localisation and instability of single _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ have prompted us to test mutual binding abilities of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in a yeast two hybrid experiment . all three _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were able to bind to _METHOD_ and to each other in any combination . these results were confirmed using the bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation assay based on split _METHOD_ . as shown in _METHOD_ _METHOD_ could be observed in the _LOCATION_ of arabidopsis embryo cells containing two transgenes consisting of the n and c terminal halves of _METHOD_ fused to different _PROTEIN_ splicing _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ was not detected in the controls .

values are the average of several independent lines for and in _PROTEIN_ . _LOCATION_ bars represent s.e.m . of at least three biological replicates . _PROTEIN_ protein accumulation in transgenic lines . lines to represent independent transgenic lines . details are described in the legend of . a series of truncated _PROTEIN_ proteins was prepared to identify the region required for self binding . a yeast two hybrid assay between these truncated _PROTEIN_ proteins and full length _PROTEIN_ identified a region of amino acids whose absence makes the protein incapable of binding . further alanine scanning experiments in this region revealed that a single replacement a tyrosine _PROTEIN_ with alanine strongly reduced self binding whereas the other seven obtained substitution mutants did not show altered self binding abilities . we were interested whether self binding is necessary for _PROTEIN_ function . to answer this question a complementation experiment was carried out using two constructs . the first contained the genomic region of the _PROTEIN_ gene from ler and the second was identical except for the replacement of tyrosine by alanine . both constructs were transformed into the _PROTEIN_ mutant and transformants with single insertion events were selected . as shown previously the genomic _PROTEIN_ clone complemented the _PROTEIN_ mutant and seeds from the transformants were dormant . in contrast the clone showed very weak complementation and of the seeds germinated directly after harvest . therefore _PROTEIN_ protein requires self binding to induce seed dormancy although lack of binding ability does not abolish its function completely . a control experiment showed that replacement of glutamic acid at position with alanine an amino acid that is not affecting self binding did not cause a reduced complementation of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . several independent transgenic lines were further analysed for _PROTEIN_ protein accumulation . interestingly _PROTEIN_ protein could be detected in all of these lines at similar levels as in the dormant nil _PROTEIN_ control . this indicated that the weak complementation of the lines was not due to reduced accumulation or instability of the mutant protein . because the _PROTEIN_ protein can not bind to itself we concluded that self binding of _PROTEIN_ does not influence its protein accumulation but is required for its full function . _PROTEIN_ was originally identified as a major qtl underlying natural variation in dormancy between the arabidopsis accessions ler and cvi . _PROTEIN_ on the _PROTEIN_ dormancy qtl was identified in several additional recombinant inbred line populations . this suggests that _PROTEIN_ is a major contributor to natural variation for seed dormancy in arabidopsis . _PROTEIN_ alleles from different accessions show sequence _METHOD_ in both promoter and coding regions . a correlation was found between dormancy levels and _PROTEIN_ transcript levels among different genotypes . accordingly it is likely that _METHOD_ in the promoters of different accessions cause variation in _PROTEIN_ strength between accessions . surprisingly a comparison of _PROTEIN_ transcript and dormancy levels in the low dormant accessions ler and col and the dormant line nil _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed that this correlation was absent in col which has relatively high _PROTEIN_ transcript levels . the _PROTEIN_ protein levels of these three genotypes correlated with their transcript levels and the col seeds showed low dormancy despite having high levels of _PROTEIN_ protein . this lack of correlation might be caused by a reduced function of the _PROTEIN_ protein . therefore the self binding ability of _PROTEIN_ was analysed . as shown in _PROTEIN_ showed significantly reduced self binding in a yeast two hybrid assay . a sequence comparison of the predicted _PROTEIN_ proteins of ler col and cvi showed a polymorphism within . in ler and cvi this region contains the amino acids eccy which are replaced by dsy in col. interestingly the tyrosine at that is required for self binding is present in all three accessions . nevertheless the observed amino acid changes are likely to affect self binding because the col _PROTEIN_ protein is not able to bind to itself . to test the influence of this polymorphism on seed dormancy two constructs containing different _PROTEIN_ alleles were introduced into the _PROTEIN_ mutant for complementation . one of the constructs contained the wild type _PROTEIN_ allele including a kb fragment upstream of the _PROTEIN_ codon and kb downstream of the _PROTEIN_ codon . the other construct coded for a modified col _PROTEIN_ protein in which the amino acids dsy at were replaced by eccy . transgenic plants containing single introgression events were selected for both constructs and their seed dormancy levels were assessed by following their germination rate during extended seed storage . similar to the _PROTEIN_ complementation lines previously obtained independent transgenic lines with the same construct showed varying degrees of dormancy . however plants with the construct encoding the eccy col _PROTEIN_ protein showed enhanced dormancy levels compared to plants containing the wild type col _PROTEIN_ construct . therefore we assume that the polymorphism at contributes to the low seed dormancy of col by reducing the self binding ability of the _PROTEIN_ protein . germination profiles of col ler and nil _PROTEIN_ after different periods of dry storage . pink triangle

sequence comparison identified three _PROTEIN_ haplotypes for the region which were named dsy dry and eccy . several accessions from each haplotype were analysed for their _PROTEIN_ binding ability using a yeast two hybrid assay . as expected the haplotype dsy showed very weak self binding which was also the case for the dry haplotype . in contrast the eccy accessions showed strong _PROTEIN_ self binding . we further studied the _PROTEIN_ haplotypes by analysis of their dormancy level and _PROTEIN_ protein accumulation in fresh seeds of representative accessions of the three groups . by combining _PROTEIN_ protein levels and haplotype we could explain a major part of the dormancy levels of these accessions . the dsy accessions had relatively low dormancy levels except for sha daejoen kondara and _PROTEIN_ that all showed high _PROTEIN_ protein levels . most of the eccy accessions had high dormancy levels while having low to medium high _PROTEIN_ protein levels . the eccy accession ler showed low dormancy but this accession had very low _PROTEIN_ protein levels . overall these data demonstrated that not only _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ but also differences in self binding ability affect the strength of _PROTEIN_ function in dormancy induction of arabidopsis natural accessions . we propose that combining the analysis of _PROTEIN_ protein levels in freshly harvested seeds with amino acid composition at the aa region can lead to an improved prediction of seed dormancy levels in arabidopsis accessions . interaction of _PROTEIN_ beta _METHOD_ with _METHOD_ in
