_PROTEIN_ of protein quality control and turnover is essential for cellular homeostasis . in plant organelles this biological process is predominantly performed by _PROTEIN_ proteases . here a genetic screen was performed that led to the identification of arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ protease mutants that exhibit a growth retardation phenotype . translational fusion to yellow _METHOD_ protein revealed subcellular localization in plant mitochondria and the gene could complement the phenotype of the yeast _PROTEIN_ gene homolog . is highly _PROTEIN_ in rapidly growing plant organs of embryonic origin including cotyledons and primary roots and in inflorescences which have increased mitochondria numbers per cell to fulfill their high energy requirements . in _PROTEIN_ mutants the _PROTEIN_ of both mitochondrial and _LOCATION_ genes encoding respiratory proteins was normal . however mitochondria isolated from _PROTEIN_ mutants had a lower capacity for respiration of succinate and cytochrome c via complexes ii and iv respectively . furthermore the activity of key enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle was significantly reduced . additionally mitochondria in _PROTEIN_ mutants had an aberrant morphology . these results shed light on the developmental _METHOD_ of selective proteolysis in plant mitochondria and suggest a critical role for protease in organelle biogenesis and seedling establishment .
a genetic screen was set up in order to identify mutants with an impaired root growth pattern . we isolated a novel mutant _PROTEIN_ which appeared to have problematic root growth . phenotypic analysis revealed that not only primary root elongation was affected but also growth as a whole . hence the primary root elongation pattern was actually delayed compared with plants resulting in delayed seedling establishment soon after germination . this growth retardation persisted during the entire biological cycle of _PROTEIN_ plants . thus mature _PROTEIN_ mutants were significantly shorter than the plants . the stem length of _PROTEIN_ plants showed a reduction of approximately compared with the wild type . in _METHOD_ of the growth rate of other plant organs the overall difference in size also persisted . measurements of both leaf lamina area and silique length indicated that the difference in growth rate between and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants persisted at maturity . in particular the leaf lamina of _PROTEIN_ plants showed a large reduction in area the leaf lamina area being less than half that of plants . in addition to the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mutant a _PROTEIN_ allele was isolated . every feature of _PROTEIN_ development and growth examined showed a reduction pattern similar to that observed in _PROTEIN_ plants . however the growth retardation of _PROTEIN_ plants was less marked than that of _PROTEIN_ . for instance the stem length leaf lamina area and silique length of _PROTEIN_ plants were not as restricted as in _PROTEIN_ albeit these differences were still significant compared with the wild type . the mutants also showed a conditional germination efficiency phenotype that was apparent at elevated temperature . under normal growth conditions the germination efficiencies of plants carrying the _PROTEIN_ mutant alleles were more or less comparable and similar to that of the plants . however the germination efficiency of plants carrying the _PROTEIN_ mutant alleles was dramatically diminished when seeds were germinated at elevated temperature . a positional cloning approach was applied to identify the gene . recombination mapping placed the molecular locus responsible for the _PROTEIN_ phenotype on the upper arm of chromosome v. thus novel markers were further generated restricting the locus in a interval of kb flanked by proximal markers indicating a unique recombination event . the eight candidate genes in the interval with _PROTEIN_ annotation numbers _GENE_ were tested for their ability to complement the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype . phenotypic analysis of and stably transformed _PROTEIN_ mutant plants revealed that _GENE_ restored the _PROTEIN_ phenotype . in accordance with the genetic complementation sequence analysis of the _GENE_ locus led to the identification of a premature termination codon in the _PROTEIN_ mutant allele . _GENE_ corresponds to a orf containing exons . it encodes a acid polypeptide with a molecular _METHOD_ of kda . a conserved kozak consensus ccaccatg resides upstream of the initiation of translation which marks the beginning of a putative mitochondrial transient peptide . the program predicted that _PROTEIN_ protease is probably localized to the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ . having linked the _GENE_ molecular locus to the _PROTEIN_ mutant allele an additional allele _PROTEIN_ was identified . as in the case of _PROTEIN_ the gene restored the growth retardation of plants carrying the _PROTEIN_ mutant allele . genotypic characterization of the _PROTEIN_ allele confirmed the site of insertion in exon of the coding sequence . primary structure analysis of the a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ protease revealed the domain the aaa module adjacent to the and domain and the proteolytic domain . the aaa module consists of two fundamental domains the domain containing the conserved motifs walker a and b and the helical domain . the aaa module is involved in _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis and in protein substrate remodeling . to confirm the predicted localization of _PROTEIN_ a _METHOD_ fusion was _PROTEIN_ in transgenic a. thaliana plants . the _METHOD_ reporter gene was inserted into the exon of cdna proximal to the _PROTEIN_ terminal of the _PROTEIN_ protease . the _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ transgene was driven by the constitutively _PROTEIN_ promoter . in cells _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ translational fusion _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was restricted to structures of typical mitochondrial morphology or particles that were distributed throughout the cytoplasm often forming conglomerates . to confirm that the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ observed indeed localized to the mitochondria whole transgenic seedlings were stained with mitotracker orange cmtmros which is a dye for living cells . the signals of the red dye and green _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were compared within the same cell using _METHOD_ microscopy . the overlap of the green and red signals resulted in yellow _METHOD_ mitochondria . this of the _METHOD_ dye that specifically stains mitochondria and the green _METHOD_ emanating from the _METHOD_ translational fusion revealed that the _PROTEIN_ protease is targeted in planta to mitochondria . yeast cells lacking the _PROTEIN_ gene accumulate lesions in the mtdna . as essential respiratory chain components are encoded by the mitochondrial genome mutants are and fail to grow on nonfermentable _PROTEIN_ sources such as glycerol or ethanol . in order to investigate whether the a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ and yeast _PROTEIN_ proteases are functionally equivalent we carried out a complementation analysis of s. cerevisiae . the gene heterologous functional complementation assay was performed by assessing the restoration of the yeast cells that carried intact mtdna as a result of the presence of the _PROTEIN_ gene . the protein stabilizes mtdna integrity in yeast cells when _PROTEIN_ protease is absent despite the _PROTEIN_ that the respiratory incompetence remains . detailed information concerning the genotype of yeast cells used for this assay is presented in table . functional analysis revealed that the a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ gene successfully complemented the phenotype of yeast cells . when their mtdna was stabilized cells were able to grow on medium containing glycerol as the sole _PROTEIN_ source as a result of the activity of the a. thaliana homologous _PROTEIN_ protease . however the _PROTEIN_ of promoted minimal growth of cells on nonfermentable _PROTEIN_ sources at . the results demonstrate the functional conservation between the mitochondrial localized yeast _PROTEIN_ and a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ proteases . furthermore they demonstrate that specific functions of _PROTEIN_ for example under heat stress within yeast mitochondria can not be performed by the plant homolog . having confirmed the mitochondrial localization of _PROTEIN_ we were interested to determine whether the gene was predominantly _PROTEIN_ in nonphotosynthetic tissues or organs with high growth rates . these tissues or organs are highly dependent upon respiration to meet their energy requirements . the gene exhibited high levels of _PROTEIN_ in germinating seedlings and organs of embryonic origin such as cotyledons and primary roots . however in mature root tissues transcripts were barely detected while the level of _PROTEIN_ was higher in developing _METHOD_ and inflorescences than in _METHOD_ of adult plants . a potential role for lon proteases in thermal stress has been suggested by transcriptional induction of the bacterial lon and yeast _PROTEIN_ homolog . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ is affected by elevated temperatures total rna was isolated from seedlings grown under several conditions . the transcript exhibited a moderate _PROTEIN_ when seedlings were grown either at overnight or at for h. however no significant decline of _PROTEIN_ was observed when seedlings were grown at either or for h. the same pattern of a moderate reduction in _PROTEIN_ was found in several independent experiments . we confirmed that the seedlings were exposed to conditions that induced a response by analyzing the transcription of the _LOCATION_ encoded cytoplasmic _PROTEIN_ or mitochondrial proteins . the results indicate that a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ transcription is under either acute or prolonged conditions . similarly the _PROTEIN_ of the maize _PROTEIN_ gene has also been reported to decline in response to thermal stress . hence unlike escherichia coli lon and yeast _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ of the homologous plant _PROTEIN_ genes from a. thaliana and maize declined in response to heat shock . to investigate the role of in _PROTEIN_ of mitochondrial function we examined whether deficiency alters the transcription level of _LOCATION_ encoded genes associated with mitochondrial activities . thus the effects of a small increase in growth temperature and the absence of light on the abundance of the measured transcripts were examined . using a primer set that anneals downstream of the insertion of _PROTEIN_ mutant plants no transcript was detected . growth of plants in the dark or under mild conditions did not alter the level of gene _PROTEIN_ . there was no evidence that the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _LOCATION_ genes encoding respiratory proteins namely the cytochrome c and genes and the alternative oxidase _PROTEIN_ gene was altered in the _PROTEIN_ mutant in comparison with the wild type . furthermore the pattern of enolase _PROTEIN_ and alcohol dehydrogenase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mutants encoding the extramitochondrial respiratory pathways markers enolase and alcohol dehydrogenase was the same as in plants . in yeast proper _PROTEIN_ of genes such as the cytochrome b and cytochrome c oxidase subunit i _PROTEIN_ genes requires _PROTEIN_ protease activity . therefore transcriptional analysis of the a. thaliana mitochondrial genes cob and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ encoding cytochrome b of respiratory complex iii and cytochrome c oxidase subunits i iii of respiratory complex iv respectively was performed . in contrast to yeast cells transcription of a. thaliana mitochondrial genes in _PROTEIN_ mutants was similar to that in plants even for the intron containing the _PROTEIN_ gene . consequently we investigated whether such _PROTEIN_ of the mitochondrial genome in _PROTEIN_ mutants is attributable to changes in the abundance of transcripts encoding other members of the lon family . nevertheless the pattern of _PROTEIN_ was unaltered in comparison to wild type . we also assessed the respiratory capacity of mitochondria isolated from _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings to further elucidate the role of _PROTEIN_ in organelle function . mitochondria isolated from _PROTEIN_ mutants had similar integrity as assessed by _PROTEIN_ to cytochrome c suggesting that overall mitochondrial integrity is not affected . however both _PROTEIN_ mutants showed evidence of reduced respiratory capacity with a significant _PROTEIN_ in the respiration by isolated mitochondria of succinate and cytochrome c via complexes ii and iv respectively . the activities of other respiratory complexes and enzymes were unaffected . additionally in the absence of the activities of at least five of seven measured tca cycle enzymes namely citrate synthase aconitase and isocitrate dehydrogenase and dehydrogenase were significantly _PROTEIN_ . morphological examination of yeast mitochondria revealed that they had an abnormal morphology . the shape of the mitochondria is irregular and inclusion bodies probably representing aggregates of mitochondrial proteins accumulate in the _PROTEIN_ . thus we examined the mitochondrial morphology of _PROTEIN_ hypocotyl tissue in ultrathin sections by transmission electron microscopy . the transmission electron micrographs indicated that _PROTEIN_ mitochondria were swollen and nonreticulated with a poorly developed internal _LOCATION_ system composed of few discernible cristae . in contrast to _PROTEIN_ mitochondria from hypocotyl tissue sections had the expected appearance that is reticulated with numerous cristae and an mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ . notably these ultrastructural features of _PROTEIN_ mitochondria are reminiscent of the promitochondrial morphology of maize and rice dry seeds suggesting a potential role of the a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ protease in mitochondrial biogenesis during germination .
