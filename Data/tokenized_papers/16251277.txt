in plants protein synthesis occurs in the _LOCATION_ mitochondria and _LOCATION_ . each compartment requires a full set of trnas and aminoacyl trna synthetases . we have undertaken a systematic analysis of the targeting of organellar aminoacyl trna synthetases in the model plant arabidopsis thaliana . dual targeting appeared to be a general rule . among the identified organellar aminoacyl trna synthetases are shared between mitochondria and _LOCATION_ and are shared between _LOCATION_ and mitochondria . only two were shown to be uniquely chloroplastic and none to be uniquely mitochondrial . moreover there are no examples where the three aars genes originating from the three ancestral genomes still coexist . these results indicate that extensive exchange of aarss has occurred during evolution and that many are now shared between two or even three compartments . the findings have important implications for studies of the translation machinery in plants and on protein targeting and gene transfer in general .
forty five _PROTEIN_ aars genes were found in the a. thaliana _LOCATION_ genome . the analysis of the a. thaliana genome revealed genes presenting similarities with aarss . the _PROTEIN_ of of could be proven by _PROTEIN_ sequence tags or by whole genome array and sequences of the probably have no aars function . the remaining aars genes must provide or aars activities to the _LOCATION_ mitochondria and _LOCATION_ which suggests that many of these enzymes have to be targeted to at least two of these three cellular compartments . sequence homology with well characterized aarss from other eukaryotes and bacteria enabled unambiguous attribution of the probable amino acid specificity of each of these enzymes . for amino acids of the only two aars genes have been found in a. thaliana . for glutamine only one _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ glnrs was found . this observation is in accordance with the _PROTEIN_ that gln trnagln formation was shown to occur by transamidation in chloroplasts and led to the suggestion that the same route of gln trna synthesis is also prevalent in mitochondria although it has been shown in yeast that the _LOCATION_ glnrs is imported into mitochondria and is involved in mitochondrial gln trnagln formation . using different computer prediction _METHOD_ and alignment of protein sequences to homologues a potential organelle targeting sequence was identified for half of the sequences . it should be stressed that the extremely high sequence conservation of these essential enzymes makes the identification of n terminal targeting information relatively straightforward . for only four amino acids were two aars with targeting sequences identified . for of these sequences putative full length mrnas were found . for the other genes _PROTEIN_ or rt pcr on their transcripts were performed to confirm the likely n terminal sequence of the protein . targeting of aarss to mitochondria and chloroplasts . to analyze the intracellular localization of the putative organellar aarss their n terminal sequences were fused to _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ reporter genes . the localization of the fusion proteins was determined by transient _PROTEIN_ in tobacco protoplasts for all constructs and by in vitro import into isolated organelles for one of each pair of constructs . _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusions always gave the same localization in vivo . in vitro import was almost always in agreement with the localization by _METHOD_ with a few exceptions discussed below . we have already shown that the targeting sequences from asnrs cysrs glyrs hisrs and metrs allow targeting to both mitochondria and chloroplasts . our systematic study demonstrates that such dual targeting is the general rule for plant organellar aarss and we have identified at least previously uncharacterized dual targeted aarss two alarss asprs phers glurs lysrs prors serrs thrrs trprs and tyrrs . the alars gene _GENE_ had already been shown to encode both _LOCATION_ and mitochondrial _METHOD_ of the enzyme but the _METHOD_ data the in vitro import and western blots all indicate that some of the mitochondrial form is also in _LOCATION_ . for all of the dual targeted proteins listed above the in vitro import gave clear unequivocal results whereas the _METHOD_ localization was often less easy to interpret . all of these _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ constructs gave strong mitochondrial signals _METHOD_ _METHOD_ but many of them gave _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ signals that were weak and that varied between experiments and between cells within the same experiment . this weak _METHOD_ was not due to passenger protein effects as results with _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusions were identical . equally transient _PROTEIN_ by agrobacterium infiltration of leaves in situ gave the same variable weak _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . two other aarss are presumably dual targeted but our results are not fully conclusive . targeting of the ilers construct to chloroplasts was observed both in vivo and in vitro . in contrast targeting to mitochondria was observed only in vitro . the _PROTEIN_ targeting sequence localized _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ to mitochondria with weak _METHOD_ sometimes observed in chloroplasts . in vitro the same _METHOD_ fusion was clearly imported into chloroplasts but not into mitochondria . these two cases are the only ones where we observed conflicting results in vivo and in vitro . contrary to all other n terminal sequences tested here in vivo and in vitro experiments showed only _LOCATION_ targeting for leurs and argrs n terminal sequences . no targeting sequence could be detected for the other leurs gene _GENE_ and its full length mrna corresponds to a protein without a targeting sequence . antibodies were available for this enzyme and tested with a. thaliana protein extracts . western blots showed that the corresponding enzyme is localized both in the _LOCATION_ and the mitochondria even if no targeting sequence could be identified . phylogenetic analysis and evolutionary origins . multiple alignments and distance trees were performed to see relationships between each a. thaliana aars and aarss from other _METHOD_ . _LOCATION_ enzymes are usually most similar to other _LOCATION_ enzymes and very different from their organellar counterparts . two exceptions are the cysrs and asnrs enzymes likely to be derived from organellar origins . the organellar enzymes are generally closest to eubacterial enzymes . nine of them show clear specific affinities with cyanobacterial sequences and are therefore strongly predicted to originate from the _LOCATION_ ancestor . five others also appear to be most related to eubacterial sequences and are therefore likely to originate from organelle ancestors . surprisingly only two enzymes show specific similarities to mitochondrial enzymes from yeast or animals . finally the organellar prors and argrs enzymes are most similar to their homologues from the eukaryotic _LOCATION_ and presumably arose by duplication of the gene for the _LOCATION_ enzyme and subsequent acquisition of an organelle targeting sequence .
