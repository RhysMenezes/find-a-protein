phytohormones regulate plant development via a poorly understood signal response network . here we show that the phytohormone ethylene regulates plant development at least in part via alteration of the properties of della protein _LOCATION_ growth repressors a family of proteins first identified as gibberellin signaling components . this conclusion is based on the following experimental observations . first ethylene inhibited arabidopsis root growth in a della dependent manner . second ethylene delayed the ga induced disappearance of the della protein repressor of from root cell _LOCATION_ via a constitutive triple response dependent signaling pathway . third the ethylene promoted apical hook structure of etiolated seedling hypocotyls was dependent on the relief of della mediated growth restraint . ethylene auxin and ga responses now can be attributed to effects on della function suggesting that della plays a key integrative role in the phytohormone signal response network .
ethylene is known to inhibit the growth of vegetative tissues . seedlings grown in ethylene gas or in the presence of the ethylene precursor aminocyclopropane _PROTEIN_ acid have reduced root lengths . we found that this effect is mediated at least in part by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in the absence of acc wild type gai _PROTEIN_ rga _PROTEIN_ and gai rga _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seedling root lengths were statistically indistinguishable . however although wild type roots were short when grown on medium containing acc roots of acc grown plants lacking _PROTEIN_ were longer than those of wild type plants . roots of acc grown plants lacking both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ appeared even longer than those of plants lacking either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ alone indicating that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ together mediate the ethylene induced inhibition of root growth . when grown on higher concentrations of acc the resultant high levels of ethylene caused a dramatic reduction in root length and the differences between wild type gai rga and gai rga roots became less apparent . thus at reduced acc levels the growth of gai rga roots is more resistant to the effects of acc than is that of wild type roots . we also found that the inhibitory effect of ethylene gas on root growth is della dependent . when grown in the presence of ethylene gai rga roots were longer than those of wild type plants . the _PROTEIN_ that acc grown gai rga plants did not have roots as long as wild type plants grown in the absence of acc shows either that additional della proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mediate the effect of ethylene on root growth or that in addition to the della protein pathway of root growth inhibition ethylene also inhibits root growth via a della protein independent pathway . della proteins can be abolished by mutation or opposed by ga . we next investigated the effect of exogenous ga treatment on acc grown wild type seedlings . we found that ga treatment could substantially overcome the acc induced inhibition of seedling root growth although this treatment had little effect on the growth of seedling roots in the absence of acc . thus _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ inhibit the growth of roots in response to ethylene but their effects can be overcome by exogenous ga treatment . we have shown that ethylene inhibits arabidopsis root growth via its effects on the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins . there are two possible explanations for this observation . first ethylene may alter the properties of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . second ethylene may reduce endogenous ga levels . these explanations are not mutually exclusive and to further investigate them we studied the behavior of a green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein in ethylene treated roots . prga _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants _PROTEIN_ a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein that is detectable in root cell _LOCATION_ and disappears rapidly in response to ga treatments . because ethylene inhibits the growth of roots via _PROTEIN_ function we tried to determine if ethylene altered the response of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to ga. as shown in figure _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ resulting from _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in both the tip and the elongation zone of the root was reduced greatly after min of ga treatment and had largely disappeared after h of ga treatment . however when seedlings were grown in air containing ethylene gas _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was more resistant to the destabilizing effects of ga treatments and was clearly visible at h after the onset of the ga treatment . thus ethylene treatment delays the ga induced disappearance of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ from root cell _LOCATION_ . one possible explanation for the results shown in figure would be that ethylene causes an increase in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ levels thus enabling the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signal to persist for a longer period after the onset of ga treatment in the presence than in the absence of ethylene . this increase in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ levels could be attributable to an increase in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transcript levels or to post transcriptional effects . to investigate these possibilities we first performed a quantitative reverse transcriptase mediated pcr experiment to compare _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcript levels in acc treated and control seedlings . as shown in figure exposure to acc had no detectable effect on either _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ transcript levels . thus the relative persistence of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signal in seedlings treated with ethylene and ga can not be attributed to an ethylene induced enhancement of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transcript levels . furthermore we also tested the effects of acc treatment on immunologically detectable _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . as shown in figure levels of immunologically detectable _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were not obviously higher in acc treated roots before the onset of ga treatment . however the immunologically detectable _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in acc treated roots was more resistant to ga treatment than that of non acc controls in agreement with the confocal microscopy data presented in figure . the results presented in figure are consistent with the idea that ethylene stabilizes _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ by enhancing resistance to the destabilizing effects of ga . ethylene is known to derepress many ethylene responses by opposing the activity of a _PROTEIN_ dependent signaling pathway . to determine if ethylene also delays the ga mediated disappearance of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ via _PROTEIN_ dependent signaling we inactivated _PROTEIN_ via transient systemic rna interference . five day old seedlings were cocultivated with agrobacterium tumefaciens containing a _PROTEIN_ rnai construct for days . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were reduced in roots infected with a. tumefaciens containing a _PROTEIN_ rnai construct but not in roots infected with control a. tumefaciens containing vector only . furthermore preinfection of prga _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ roots with a. tumefaciens containing the _PROTEIN_ rnai construct caused _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to be relatively resistant to ga treatments . although _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ disappeared rapidly in response to ga treatment in prga _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ roots infected with control a. tumefaciens _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ still was clearly detectable in roots infected with a. tumefaciens containing a _PROTEIN_ rnai construct at h after the onset of ga treatment . these observations indicate that ethylene delays the ga induced disappearance of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ from root cell _LOCATION_ by opposing the activity of the _PROTEIN_ signaling pathway . to confirm this result we sought to determine if the same effect was observed in plants homozygous for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and for the prga _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgene . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ of young seedling roots was analyzed as described above . as shown in figure _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was more resistant to ga treatment in the _PROTEIN_ background than in a wild type background . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was still detectable in root cell _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ prga _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ at and h after ga treatment whereas the signal was substantially gone after h of ga treatment in wild type prga _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants . thus ethylene delays the ga mediated disappearance of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ via a _PROTEIN_ dependent signaling pathway . the apical hook is a transient developmental curvature of the hypocotyl that is characteristic of the seedling triple response . the curvature is caused by asymmetric growth of the inner and outer sides of the hypocotyl which results from differential cell division and elongation . in addition apical hook development can be divided into distinct establishment and _PROTEIN_ phases . we found that della proteins repressed the presence of the apical hook in day old etiolated seedlings . although wild type seedlings exhibited a pronounced apical hook ga deficient mutant seedlings did not . the hypocotyls of day old etiolated seedlings lacking _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ were curved slightly whereas the combined absence of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ suppressed the absence of hook phenotype conferred by . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ inhibit the apical hook of day old seedlings whereas the ga in wild type seedlings opposes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ activity and promotes the presence of the hook . we next found that the ga/della effect on apical hook structure was the result of effects on hook _PROTEIN_ but not on hook establishment . seedlings initially established an apical hook but this hook disappeared before the seedlings were days old . by contrast wild type and gai rga hypocotyls established and _PROTEIN_ an apical hook during this period . it is important to note that the lack of apical hook _PROTEIN_ exhibited by is not a simple consequence of its reduced growth . when hypocotyls grew to a length equivalent to that of day old wild type hypocotyls no apical hook structure was observed . the coordination of differential cell growth in the apical hook is orchestrated by several phytohormones of which auxin and ethylene have been studied extensively . auxin treatments reduce whereas ethylene enhances the curvature of the apical hooks of day old seedlings . we next investigated the relationships between the ga/della signaling system and the ethylene and auxin signaling pathways in apical hook development as we had done previously for root growth . we found that the della proteins act downstream of the effects of ethylene and auxin on apical hook _PROTEIN_ . some of these experiments used the arabidopsis gai mutant . this mutant shares many of the phenotypic characteristics of ga deficient mutants except that its phenotype can not be restored to normal by treatment with ga . like day old etiolated gai seedlings did not display an apical hook structure . in the presence of ga seedlings exhibited an apical hook whereas gai seedlings did not . in the presence of paclobutrazol _PROTEIN_ an inhibitor of ga biosynthesis only the gai rga line _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and not or the wild type exhibited an apical hook confirming that ga regulates hook _PROTEIN_ via della signaling _PROTEIN_ . ethylene promoted the _PROTEIN_ of the apical hook of day old wild type seedlings whereas _PROTEIN_ exhibited an exaggerated apical hook in the absence of ethylene . interestingly _PROTEIN_ reduced the exaggerated hypocotyl curvature conferred by _PROTEIN_ whereas hypocotyls were unaffected by acc . gai hypocotyls curved slightly in response to acc treatments probably because ga responses in gai are reduced but not abolished completely . combined treatment with both ga and acc resulted in hypocotyl curvature in similar to that seen in wild type plants treated with acc . thus for ethylene to promote hook _PROTEIN_ the ga mediated opposition of the della repression of hook _PROTEIN_ needs to be in operation . auxin also coordinates differential cell growth in the apical hook . exogenous auxin inhibits apical hook formation . mutants that accumulate high levels of auxin display a hookless phenotype and auxin transport inhibitors inhibit hook formation . we found that etiolated seedlings _PROTEIN_ grown in the presence of npa were hookless with the exception of gai rga . thus as shown previously for root growth auxin mediates its effects on apical hook formation via the della proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ .
all experiments used the landsberg _LOCATION_ laboratory strain of arabidopsis thaliana as genetic background except in the case of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the _PROTEIN_ gai gai and rga mutations and the prga _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ line were as described previously . the _PROTEIN_ prga _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ line was isolated from the progeny of a cross between _PROTEIN_ and prga _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . all seeds were surface sterilized and placed on gm medium plates containing to m aminocyclopropane _PROTEIN_ acid at for days to synchronize germination . then plates were placed in a vertical orientation in a growth room . for each growth condition root lengths of at least day old seedlings were measured from root tip to the base of the hypocotyls . all seeds were surface sterilized and pretreated at with gibberellin for days to synchronize germination . seeds then were washed thoroughly and placed on gm medium plates containing ga acc paclobutrazol or naphthylphthalamic acid and placed vertically in a growth room . after days of growth one representative seedling was chosen and photographed . total rna was extracted from primary roots of day old seedlings grown in the presence or absence of acc using trizol reagent . cdna was generated using the superscript rnase reverse transcriptase kit . pcr amplification and blot analyses were performed as described previously . the primer pairs used for pcr amplification were as follows for _PROTEIN_ tcatgctcgagtcctgattctatgg and gacaatgatcgatctgattctgc for _METHOD_ cggcacgacttcttcaagagcgcc and _PROTEIN_ . the expected dna fragment sizes for cdna amplification corresponded to bp _PROTEIN_ and bp _METHOD_ . as a control a fragment from the gene that encodes the eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation _PROTEIN_ was amplified using the primers ttctcaaaccataagcataaatac and aaactcaatgaagtacttgaggga . prga _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants were grown on gm medium in the presence or absence of acc for days . whole seedlings then were treated with ga for and h. the primary roots were harvested and frozen in liquid . total protein was extracted and quantified as described by citation . for each treatment of proteins was separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and transferred to a nitrocellulose _LOCATION_ . immunodetection was performed using a fold dilution of anti _METHOD_ monoclonal antibodies from mouse and a fold dilution of peroxidase conjugated goat anti mouse igg . signals were detected by chemiluminescence using the enhanced chemiluminescence protein gel blot analysis system . transient gene silencing was performed as described previously . the _PROTEIN_ coding fragment sequence was amplified by pcr with the primers ggggacaagtttgtacaaaaaagcaggctgagacgatgccgcttcg and ggggaccactttgtacaagaaagctgggtccacgggatgtccatatc and cloned twice in the inverse orientation . five day old prga _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings grown on gm medium plates were cocultivated with agrobacterium tumefaciens strain containing rna interference inactivated _PROTEIN_ or empty vector for days in ml of citation liquid medium . the efficiency of the transient silencing was tested using reverse transcriptase mediated pcr . total rna generation of cdna and amplification by pcr were as described above . the _PROTEIN_ primers used for pcr amplification were ggtggttcccataggtagcctctc and gacagtgccaaaggaacctgctcc . ubiquitin transcripts _PROTEIN_ also were amplified as a constitutive _PROTEIN_ control . the _PROTEIN_ primers were aactttctctcaattctctctacc and cttcttaagcataacagagacgag . the expected dna fragment sizes for cdna amplification corresponded to bp _PROTEIN_ and kb _PROTEIN_ . confocal microscopy images were obtained with a leica inverted confocal laser microscope with objectives . the excitation wavelength for _METHOD_ detection was nm . all images were obtained with the same modifications and intensity parameters . for the ethylene treatment prga _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings were grown on gm medium plates in an ethylene chamber . five day old seedlings growing in ethylene or in air were treated with ga and analyzed for the presence of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . for the transient _PROTEIN_ silencing day old prga _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings were cocultivated as described above and treated for and h with ga . upon request materials integral to the findings presented in this publication will be made available in a timely manner to all investigators on similar _METHOD_ for noncommercial research purposes . to obtain materials please contact nicholas p. harberd nicholas.harberd { at } bbsrc.ac.uk .
