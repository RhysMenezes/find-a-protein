the binding protein _PROTEIN_ of arabidopsis thaliana is a new type protein that binds to phosphatidylinositol phosphates and calmodulin complex as well as free . although biochemical properties such as binding to ligands and n myristoylation have been revealed the intracellular localization tissue and cell specificity integrity of _LOCATION_ association and physiological roles of _PROTEIN_ are unknown . we investigated the tissue and intracellular distribution of _PROTEIN_ by using transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ linked with a green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ at the _PROTEIN_ terminus of _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was obviously detected in most tissues including root stem leaf and flower . in these tissues _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was observed predominantly in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ even under physiological stress conditions but not in other organelles . the _METHOD_ was detected in the _LOCATION_ when the residue n terminal sequence was deleted from _PROTEIN_ indicating essential contribution of n myristoylation to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ anchoring . _METHOD_ intensity of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in roots was slightly _PROTEIN_ in seedlings grown in medium supplemented with high concentrations of iron for week and increased in those grown with copper . in stomatal guard cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was strictly specifically localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ at the epidermal cell side but not at the pore side . a t dna insertion mutant line of _PROTEIN_ did not show marked phenotype in a life cycle except for well growth under high _PROTEIN_ conditions . however stomata of the mutant line did not close entirely even in high osmolarity which usually induces stomata closure . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is involved in the stomatal movement especially closure process in leaves and response to excessive copper in root and leaf as a mineral nutrient as a physiological role .
_PROTEIN_ is a soluble protein and was detected in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fraction after subcellular fractionation . to investigate the intracellular localization we prepared the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct and _PROTEIN_ it in col under the control of the own promoter _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ was linked to the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ because the n terminal glycine residue is myristoylated after removal of the first methionine as described previously . transformation of the construct was confirmed by pcr using primer sets for _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ dnas . transgenic lines and shown in fig . were used for further experiments . plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pro _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ grew normally and showed clear green _METHOD_ in various tissues of day old seedlings . _METHOD_ green _METHOD_ was observed in cotyledon epidermal cells petioles hypocotyls roots and root hairs . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was detected specifically in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but neither in the _LOCATION_ of other organelles nor the cytoplasm . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was detected uniformly in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in most cells but unevenly detected exceptionally in guard cells . plants at the reproducible stage day old also showed clear _METHOD_ in rosette and cauline leaves _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ stomata sepals styles anthers filaments stigma and seedpods . root hairs showed clear _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in day old and day old seedlings . leaf trichomes also showed _METHOD_ . clear _METHOD_ was detected predominantly in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . at the vegetative growth stage examined the same images were obtained in inner cells of each tissue . these observations indicate constitutive _PROTEIN_ throughout the life cycle of the plant and stable association of _PROTEIN_ with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and suggest that _PROTEIN_ is a common element in various tissues . in the guard cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was clearly observed in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ only on the outer side facing the epidermal cells but not that of the inner side facing the pore in the pair of guard cells . there is a possibility that guard cells do not _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but surrounding epidermal cells do . thus this side specific localization of _PROTEIN_ was examined by quantitative analysis of the _METHOD_ intensity . _METHOD_ image of the surface area of a guard cell and its cross section image of the same cell are shown in fig . and b respectively . clear green _METHOD_ was detected in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of guard cell in the cross section of the stomata which could be distinguished from that of neighbor epidermal cells . in this image the _METHOD_ intensity at the adjacent region was relatively high compared with other parts . furthermore _METHOD_ peaks corresponding to guard cells and epidermal cells were detected individually when analyzed for some specific region with appropriate distance between the two cells . the _METHOD_ intensity in the outer side of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ which face to the epidermal cell was markedly higher than that of inner pore side . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is localized predominantly on the outer side of the guard cell _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to examine whether or not the side specific _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ in the guard cells depends on modification with a myristoyl moiety we introduced the modified construct without the n terminal myristoylation site of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ into col . three constructs namely free _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were _PROTEIN_ under the control of the guard cell specific promoter _PROTEIN_ . only the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct showed the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization especially in their outer side . free _METHOD_ was detected predominantly in _LOCATION_ and the cytoplasm and _METHOD_ in the cytoplasm . these observations indicate that the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ association and its side specific localization depend on the n terminal myristoylation . iron is an essential micronutrient of plants and can be toxic at excessive levels . the plants grown under normal conditions for days were transplanted to the medium containing mm to examine the response of _PROTEIN_ to excessive iron the _METHOD_ was enhanced after h especially in root hairs . the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization was not altered even after the treatment . when plants were germinated and grown under excessive iron conditions the growth of shoots and roots was remarkably suppressed . in contrast to the short period treatment the _METHOD_ intensity was _PROTEIN_ to of that of control plants after days under the excessive iron . copper is also an essential micronutrient . increase in _PROTEIN_ transcription by excessive copper was reported previously . furthermore _PROTEIN_ has been reported to bind and change its higher order structure . to examine effect of copper on the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ seeds of plant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pro _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were germinated and grown under excessive copper conditions at mm . in both treatments with green _METHOD_ intensity was increased by in roots compared with roots grown under normal conditions . enhancement of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by excessive was observed in the first rosette leaf which did not contact with the gel solution . this was consistent with the effect on transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pro gus which were cultivated in the presence of mm for weeks . plant growth was markedly suppressed indicating that the concentration of mm was toxic for plants . enhancement of gene _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ especially in cotyledons leaves and stomata by the treatment with was also detected . flagellin oligopeptide has been used as a trigger of pathological reaction in plants . generally tissues respond to a pathological elicitor within a few minutes and the transcriptional levels of the related genes for defense are raised within h . we treated rosette leaves of day old plants with and monitored _METHOD_ image of the leaf epidermal tissue at and min after the start of treatment . no marked difference in _METHOD_ intensity and intracellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was detected . these results show that does not induce _PROTEIN_ within min . marked enhancement of _PROTEIN_ and accumulation of _PROTEIN_ protein by excessive copper led us to examine the physiological effect of the loss of _PROTEIN_ on copper tolerance . we prepared homozygous t dna inserted loss of function mutants of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in which t dna was inserted into the third intron and the fourth exon respectively . neither mrna or protein of _PROTEIN_ was detected in these mutants . under excessive copper conditions growth of col was suppressed . the _PROTEIN_ mutant was highly sensitive to excessive copper compared with col . this result suggests the involvement of _PROTEIN_ in tolerance to excessive copper . side specific localization in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of guard cells led us to examine physiological role of _PROTEIN_ in stomatal movement . stomatal aperture was examined under normal conditions in light using epidermal strips from leaves of col _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . stomata in all leaves from wild type and mutant plants fully opened in mosm sorbitol buffer after the exposure to h light . no difference in the width length ratio of stomata was observed between col and the mutants . the width length ratio obtained in this study was normal and consistent with values reported for a. thaliana previously . in general stomata close when treated with high concentration solutions even under light conditions . therefore we performed a stomata closing assay on epidermal strips from two independent _PROTEIN_ lines . in the assay medium was changed the medium from mosm buffer to mosm buffer stomata in col leaves clearly closed . however stomata in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant did not close completely . the width length ratios of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were and higher than that of col respectively indicating dysfunction of these mutants in stomata closure . the guard cells of the mutants were not damaged because the ratio was completely recovered to the open state when the assay buffer was changed to the normal mosm buffer . the present data indicate that _PROTEIN_ is involved in the stomata closing process in response to high osmolarity . stomatal aperture is regulated by various environmental _PROTEIN_ such as humidity temperature light water state of leaf and abscisic acid through calcium signaling . under osmotic stresses malate metabolism and malate transporters such as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have been shown to play an important role in stomatal response to physiological stimuli . furthermore a high atmospheric _PROTEIN_ condition is known to close the leaf stomata . we compared the growth of col with that of _PROTEIN_ mutant under normal and high _PROTEIN_ conditions . growth of _PROTEIN_ mutant was approximately better than that of col on day under normal _PROTEIN_ conditions . high _PROTEIN_ conditions stimulated growth of both col and _PROTEIN_ . shoot fresh weight of _PROTEIN_ was greater than that of col on day .

information concerning the insertion mutants was obtained from the salk institute genomic analysis laboratory website . homozygous transgenic lines were selected by pcr after the second back cross and the t dna insertion sites were confirmed . in some experiments col and mutant lines were cultivated in growth chambers which had _PROTEIN_ concentrations controlled at or ppm . transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ pro _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct were prepared as follows . a dna segment of the _PROTEIN_ promoter followed by the open reading frame of _PROTEIN_ was amplified from an a. thaliana genomic dna preparation by pcr using a primer set forward caccatgggttactggaattccaag and _PROTEIN_ . the obtained fragments were inserted into pentr/d topo and then sub cloned into the vector which contained a synthetic _METHOD_ whose ser was substituted with threonine . the resulting plasmid was termed _PROTEIN_ pro _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in some experiments _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and its modified variant were _PROTEIN_ under the control of promoter of guard cell specific gene _PROTEIN_ . for preparation of which lacks the n terminal region the orf of _PROTEIN_ was amplified from the genomic dna preparation by pcr using a primer set cacctctctagaagctgctgaagctaccaag and _PROTEIN_ . the obtained fragment was sub cloned into the vector to prepare the dna fragment _METHOD_ . the dna fragment was then inserted into the down stream of _PROTEIN_ pro of agrobacterium binary vector . the plasmid obtained was named _PROTEIN_ pro _METHOD_ . arabidopsis thaliana col plants were transformed by the floral dip method using agrobacterium tumefaciens strain carrying the _PROTEIN_ pro _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ binary vector . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transformants were grown on half strength _METHOD_ agarose plates containing kanamycin . transformants were selected by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the obtained plants were used for _METHOD_ observation by confocal laser scanning microscopy _PROTEIN_ . histochemical assay of _PROTEIN_ promoter gus gene _PROTEIN_ plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ promoter gus gene were prepared as described previously . an upstream region that contained a noncoding region of bp and a bp section of the coding region of _PROTEIN_ was amplified from genomic dna by pcr and was ligated into the binary vector which contains the dna sequence for _PROTEIN_ . the chimeric constructs were introduced into the agrobacterium tumefaciens strain by electroporation and used to transform a. thaliana plants . transformants were selected on plates containing benlate mg cefotax hygromycin and kanamycin . transformants were grown on the medium containing _METHOD_ salt mm mes koh sucrose and gellan gum and then assayed for gus activity . gus activity was visualized by treatment of whole seedlings with acetone for min at . after washing with mm sodium phosphate buffer the samples were infiltrated with a solution containing mm sodium phosphate buffer mm _PROTEIN_ mm _PROTEIN_ mm edta mm bromo chloro indolyl d _PROTEIN_ methanol and triton x under vacuum for min and then incubated at until blue histochemical stain was confirmed . the regular incubation period was h. observations were conducted with an upright confocal laser scanning microscope using a set of and filters . for imaging the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ tissues were treated with propidium iodide for staining of cell walls . propidium iodide red _METHOD_ was visualized with a confocal laser scanning microscope set at nm for excitation and at nm for emission . the intensities of green _METHOD_ were extracted from _PROTEIN_ images using asw . stomatal aperture of wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants was assayed using leaves of week old plants grown on agar plates as described previously . the whole leaves were detached just before the light period started and glued the abaxial side onto a coverslip using a non toxic medical adhesive . the adaxial epidermis and mesophyll layers were gently removed . the coverslips with the glued abaxial epidermis were placed in a petri dish containing a mosm buffer . the mosm buffer contained mm mes koh ph mm kcl and mm sorbitol . a mosm buffer contained mm mes koh ph mm kcl and mm sorbitol . the epidermis was equilibrated for h in light in the mosm buffer and measured for stomatal aperture . then the assay buffer was changed to the mosm buffer . finally the buffer for the same epidermis was changed to the mosm buffer to confirm the reversibility of stomata movement . five leaves from col _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were analyzed in parallel . about pictures per leaf and per time point were taken using an inverted microscope at a magnification . each picture contains approximately stomata . stomatal apertures were measured manually using the imagej software . for each time point more than stomatal apertures were measured .
