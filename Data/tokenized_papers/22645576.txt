the arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ is required for accumulation of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol and for the activation of systemic acquired resistance an inducible defense mechanism that confers resistance against a broad spectrum of pathogens . _PROTEIN_ which has been suggested to be involved in lipid based signaling in sar contains a putative chloroplast transit peptide and has glycerol phosphate synthesizing dihydroxyacetone phosphate reductase activity . the goals of this study were to determine if the dhap reductase activity and chloroplast localization are required for _PROTEIN_ s involvement in galactolipid metabolism and sar signaling . the crystal structure of a leishmania mexicana glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase was used to model _PROTEIN_ structure and identify and _PROTEIN_ as potential catalytic site residues in _PROTEIN_ . mutational analysis of _PROTEIN_ confirmed that and _PROTEIN_ are critical for _PROTEIN_ s dhap reductase activity and its involvement in sar . _PROTEIN_ proteins with these residues individually substituted by ala lacked dhap reductase activity and were unable to complement the sar defect of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein was also unable to restore mgdg content when _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . in vivo imaging of a green _METHOD_ protein tagged _PROTEIN_ protein demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ is targeted to the chloroplast . the n terminal amino acids which are required for proper targeting of _PROTEIN_ to the chloroplast are also required for _PROTEIN_ s function in lipid metabolism and sar . taken together these results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ s dhap reductase activity is required in the chloroplast for lipid metabolism and defense signaling .
sequence alignment of the _PROTEIN_ protein to other known gpdhs predicted an nad dependent gpdh domain corresponding to amino acid residues at the c terminal half of _PROTEIN_ and an nad binding domain in the n terminal half of the protein _PROTEIN_ . a highly conserved nad /nadh binding gxgxxg motif is present beginning at amino acid . the crystal structure of the leishmaniamexicana gpdh holo enzyme in complex with nadh revealed that amino acids and _PROTEIN_ of lmgpdh are in the vicinity of the nicotinamide moiety of nadh . further study of a ternary complex involving lmgpdh with the substrate dhap and the product nad confirmed that amino acids _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are part of the active site region . alignment of the lmgpdh sequence with the _PROTEIN_ amino acid sequence revealed that these amino acids are conserved in _PROTEIN_ and correspond to amino acids _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ . in lmgpdh and have been shown to form h bonds with the o atom of dhap from which a proton is removed during the oxidation of _PROTEIN_ to dhap . furthermore replacement of and with ala or met in lmgpdh disrupted its enzyme activity . to further determine if and in _PROTEIN_ correspond to and of lmgpdh a homology model was generated using swiss a protein modeling server _PROTEIN_ and the rasmol molecular graphics visualization . analysis of the derived model of the _PROTEIN_ wt protein indicated that the overall structure of _PROTEIN_ is similar to that of lmgpdh and includes helices strands and turns . based on this model _PROTEIN_ amino acids and are located in the same position as amino acids and in lmgpdh . this model also predicts that _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ which corresponds to _PROTEIN_ in lmgpdh is adjacent to and and thus is likely involved in _PROTEIN_ s dhap reductase activity . proposed structure of wild type and mutated _PROTEIN_ proteins based on the structure of a leishmania mexicana _PROTEIN_ dehydrogenase . a ribbon model of the leishmania mexicana gpdh enzyme based on its crystal structure is shown . the structure of the wild type _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ proteins in which residues and _PROTEIN_ are replaced by ala were modeled based on the structure of with the swiss model and rasmol www.rasmol.org softwares . to determine if and _PROTEIN_ are critical for _PROTEIN_ s enzymatic activity recombinant wild type and mutant _PROTEIN_ proteins in which these amino acids were replaced by ala were produced in escherichia coli . the recombinant proteins had a his tag at the c terminal end which facilitated their purification over a ni column . as shown in figure a the wt and mutant _PROTEIN_ proteins exhibited the expected molecular _METHOD_ of kda . _PROTEIN_ wt demonstrated dhap reductase activity with michaelis menten kinetics with an apparent km of for dhap . apparent vmax for _PROTEIN_ wt was . replacement of any one of the three residues and _PROTEIN_ with ala in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ recombinant constructs resulted in complete loss of _PROTEIN_ s dhap reductase activity . dhap reductase activity of wt and mutant _PROTEIN_ protein . immunodetection of the recombinant _PROTEIN_ proteins with anti his tag antibody . dhap reductase activity of the purified recombinant _PROTEIN_ wt and proteins . dhap reductase activity was measured as the rate of _PROTEIN_ in nm due to oxidation of nadh to nad . no activity was detected with the recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ proteins . functional complementation of an e. coli _PROTEIN_ auxotrophic mutant by wt and mutant _PROTEIN_ proteins . growth of the e. coli dhap reductase deficient strain _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the wt and mutant _PROTEIN_ constructs on minimal liquid medium with or without glycerol . the empty vector transformed e. coli provided the negative control . cell growth was determined by measuring the optical density at . g supplemented with glycerol without glycerol . dhap reductase activity of wt and mutant _PROTEIN_ proteins . nd no activity detected . further confirmation of the importance of and _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ s enzymatic activity was obtained by _PROTEIN_ the ala substituted mutant proteins and the _PROTEIN_ wt protein in the e. coli gpsa mutant strain _PROTEIN_ . this e. coli mutant lacks a gpdh activity resulting in _PROTEIN_ auxotrophy which can be complemented by glycerol and by the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . as shown in figure c unlike the sfd wt construct the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant constructs were unable to complement the _PROTEIN_ auxotrophy of the e. coli gpsa mutant strain _PROTEIN_ . the ala substitutions in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are predicted to not have any significant impact on the structure of _PROTEIN_ . taken together the above results confirm that and _PROTEIN_ are critical for _PROTEIN_ s dhap reductase activity . to determine if _PROTEIN_ s dhap reductase activity is required for its involvement in sar the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant constructs were _PROTEIN_ from the cauliflower mosaic virus gene promoter in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background . plants transformed with the _PROTEIN_ wt and empty vector provided the positive and negative controls respectively for these experiments . the wt accession and _PROTEIN_ mutant plant provided additional controls . reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions analysis confirmed that compared to the _PROTEIN_ mutant and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants transformed with the empty vector the _PROTEIN_ transcript accumulated at high levels in transgenic plants with the wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant constructs . to monitor sar in these transgenics a mix of plants derived from three independent transgenic lines for each construct were used . sar was induced by inoculating three fully expanded lower leaves of each plant with a suspension of an avirulent strain of p. syringae pv . tomato . three days _PROTEIN_ four upper leaves were _PROTEIN_ with p. syringae pv . maculicola a virulent pathogen and bacterial numbers in these pma inoculated leaves monitored days post inoculation . plants that received a inoculation of mm provided the negative control for comparing the extent of sar enhanced resistance to pma . as shown in figure b in the wt plant pma numbers were significantly lower in the plants that received a inoculation of pto than in those that were treated with mm indicating that sar was activated . in contrast as previously demonstrated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ sar was not activated in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . pma numbers were comparable in the upper leaves of the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants that were previously treated with mm or pto . like the _PROTEIN_ mutant and the empty vector transformed _PROTEIN_ mutant plants sar was also not activated in transgenic plants transformed with the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant constructs confirming that these amino acids which are critical for _PROTEIN_ s dhap reductase activity are also required for _PROTEIN_ s involvement in sar . systemic acquired resistance in _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the wild type and mutant _PROTEIN_ . rt pcr analysis of the _PROTEIN_ transgene _PROTEIN_ in leaves of the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants transformed with the empty vector the wild type _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant constructs and the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein fusion _PROTEIN_ constructs . rna extracted from non transformed _PROTEIN_ mutant provided the negative control . the f plus a reverse primer specific for the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ were used for the pcr reaction to monitor _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ transgenes . this primer pair does not detect _PROTEIN_ of the genomic _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ of the actin gene _PROTEIN_ provided the control for rt pcr . sar conferred resistance against p. syringae pv . maculicola in the wild type arabidopsis accession plant the _PROTEIN_ mutant and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants transformed with the indicated constructs . sar was induced by prior inoculation of a lower leaf with p. syringae pv . tomato carrying the avirulence gene . plants similarly treated with mm provided the mock control for sar . three days after the primary inoculation the distal leaves were _PROTEIN_ with p. syringae pv . maculicola . pma numbers were monitored days post inoculation . each bar represents the average colony forming units of pma sd in three samples each containing five leaf disks . an indicates significant differences in bacterial numbers relative to the corresponding mock control . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ wt also complemented the galactolipid defect of the _PROTEIN_ allele . as previously demonstrated and shown in figures a b the _PROTEIN_ mutation resulted in a reduction in the content of the _LOCATION_ synthesized mgdg . furthermore a corresponding increase in mgdg which is synthesized from dag derived from the _LOCATION_ pathway was also observed in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . to determine if the dhap reductase activity of _PROTEIN_ is essential for its involvement in lipid metabolism and mgdg content were compared between the _PROTEIN_ wt and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants . the wt and the _PROTEIN_ mutant provided additional controls . as shown in figure a in comparison to the _PROTEIN_ wt plants mgdg content as a fraction of total mgdg was lower in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plant and mgdg content was higher . the and mgdg contents in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plant were comparable to those in the _PROTEIN_ mutant plant thus confirming that and hence _PROTEIN_ s dhap reductase activity is critical for its involvement in arabidopsis lipid metabolism . and mgdg content in _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ wild type and mutant _PROTEIN_ . and mgdg content in the wild type accession _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transformed with the _PROTEIN_ wt and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mis sense mutant . and mgdg content in the wt _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transformed with the empty vector and the _PROTEIN_ construct . in all values are the average of five independent samples given as the fraction of and mgdg species relative to the total mgdg content . an denotes significant differences relative to the wt . a denotes significant differences relative to all other genotypes . as mentioned above and indicated in figure a ipsort predicts that _PROTEIN_ has at its n terminus a chloroplast targeting sequence . furthermore proteomics studies have identified _PROTEIN_ in the envelope fraction of chloroplasts _PROTEIN_ . we tested chloroplast localization of _PROTEIN_ in transgenic plants that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fused to green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ was fused to the last _PROTEIN_ amino acid of _PROTEIN_ . rt pcr analysis confirmed _PROTEIN_ of the transgene in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants . _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion also complemented the sar defect of the _PROTEIN_ mutant confirming that the fusion protein was biologically functional . by comparison _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ alone was unable to complement the sar defect of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and red _METHOD_ of chloroplasts was monitored in protoplasts isolated from the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transformed _PROTEIN_ plants and as controls in protoplasts isolated from _PROTEIN_ plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the non transformed _PROTEIN_ plants . as shown in figure b protoplasts derived from the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transformed line exhibited a _METHOD_ _METHOD_ pattern that overlapped very well with the red _METHOD_ of chloroplasts confirming that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion is localized to the chloroplast . by contrast in protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ alone strong green _METHOD_ was observed outside the chloroplasts . as expected green _METHOD_ was not observed in protoplasts derived from the non transformed _PROTEIN_ plants . the n terminal amino acids of _PROTEIN_ are required for targeting _PROTEIN_ to the chloroplast . sar conferred resistance against p. syringae pv . maculicola in the wild type arabidopsis accession plant and in transgenic _PROTEIN_ mutant plants that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs in which the _METHOD_ coding sequence is fused in frame to the c terminus of the _PROTEIN_ protein . refer to legend to figure b on details for the induction of sar . an indicates significant differences in pma numbers in plants that were previously treated with an avirulent pathogen relative to plants that received a prior mock treatment . the green _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ and red _METHOD_ of chloroplasts were observed in protoplasts isolated from leaves of week old _PROTEIN_ mutant and transgenic _PROTEIN_ mutant plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . merged images of green _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ and red _METHOD_ of chloroplasts are also depicted . to determine if the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ which contains the predicted chloroplast targeting sequence is required for targeting _PROTEIN_ to the chloroplast a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct was generated in which the n terminal amino acids of _PROTEIN_ were deleted and _METHOD_ was fused to the last _PROTEIN_ amino acid of _PROTEIN_ . rt pcr confirmed that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct was _PROTEIN_ in the transgenic plants . protoplasts derived from transgenic _PROTEIN_ plants _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ construct were observed for _METHOD_ _METHOD_ pattern . as shown in figure b the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed a punctate pattern that did not overlap with the red _METHOD_ of chloroplasts thus indicating that the n terminal amino acids are required for proper targeting of _PROTEIN_ to chloroplasts . the _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ and purified from e. coli exhibited dhap reductase activity with an apparent km of for dhap and vmax of . in addition this construct efficiently complemented the _PROTEIN_ auxotrophy of the e. coli gpsa mutant strain _PROTEIN_ thus indicating that the n terminal amino acids of _PROTEIN_ are not critical for its dhap reductase activity . however _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in transgenic plants did not complement the mgdg defect of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . furthermore _PROTEIN_ was unable to restore sar in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background . similarly the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion was unable to complement the sar defect of _PROTEIN_ . taken together these results indicate that the n terminal amino acids which are required for targeting _PROTEIN_ to chloroplasts are critical for _PROTEIN_ s involvement in sar and lipid metabolism .
