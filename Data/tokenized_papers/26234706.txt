plant roots secrete a significant portion of their assimilated _PROTEIN_ into the rhizosphere . the putative sugar transporter _PROTEIN_ is highly _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis roots . _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusions confirmed that _PROTEIN_ accumulates highly in root cells and thus may contribute to sugar secretion specifically from epidermal cells of the root apex . _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein fusions localized to the tonoplast which engulfs the major sugar storage compartment . functional analysis of _PROTEIN_ activity in yeast showed low uptake activity for the _PROTEIN_ analog deoxyglucose consistent with a role in the transport of _PROTEIN_ across the tonoplast . loss of function _PROTEIN_ mutants showed reduced tolerance to excess _PROTEIN_ lower _PROTEIN_ accumulation in leaves and higher _PROTEIN_ derived _PROTEIN_ efflux from roots suggesting that _PROTEIN_ has a role in preventing the loss of sugar from root tissue . _PROTEIN_ root _PROTEIN_ was induced more than fold during pythium infection . importantly _PROTEIN_ mutants were more susceptible to the oomycete showing impaired growth after infection . we propose that root _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ modulates sugar secretion possibly by reducing the availability of _PROTEIN_ sequestered in the _LOCATION_ thereby limiting _PROTEIN_ loss to the rhizosphere . moreover the reduced availability of sugar in the rhizosphere due to _PROTEIN_ activity contributes to resistance to pythium .
arabidopsis roots can take up sugars into the _LOCATION_ and removal of external supply leads to rapid elimination of sugars from the _LOCATION_ either by catabolism compartmentation or efflux . to explore whether sugars or their products can efflux from roots we supplied radiotracer labeled glc to roots and analyzed the percentage of secreted compounds relative to total glc uptake in arabidopsis seedlings . seedlings grown in sugar free media took up significantly larger amounts of glc compared with those grown in the presence of suc an effect that could either be due to feedback inhibition or to competition from invertase derived hexose pools in the apoplasm of suc grown plants . similar amounts of labeled compounds were secreted from seedlings in both media but the percentage of exported glc derived was greatly increased from for seedlings grown without suc to in seedlings previously exposed to suc . similarly approximately of the total glc that had been taken up was exported from roots of mature plants when grown without additional sugars . the percentage of exported from arabidopsis seedlings and mature roots was similar indicating that roots are the _PROTEIN_ source of _PROTEIN_ efflux . while it has been possible to determine _LOCATION_ glc and suc levels in cells from axenically grown arabidopsis roots we do not have information on _LOCATION_ sugar levels of soil grown plants . since sugars particularly glc are major components detected in root exudates and the apoplasmic compartment sugars are the most likely form of exported labeled compounds measured here . we hypothesize that microbiota will rapidly take up and metabolize sugars secreted by the plant thereby generating a steep gradient that favors sugar efflux via facilitative transporters . sugar biosensors may be suitable tools for determining the exudates more directly . to study transporters potentially involved in the efflux of sugars from roots we characterized the root _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . quantitative reverse transcription pcr showed that _PROTEIN_ mrna was _PROTEIN_ in roots and aerial organs at all developmental stages tested . the ubiquitous pattern of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is consistent with the steady state _PROTEIN_ profile from the arabidopsis _METHOD_ browser . since it is known that _PROTEIN_ and genes are _PROTEIN_ in both shoots and roots while the respective proteins predominantly accumulate in roots we characterized transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ a translational gus fusion of _PROTEIN_ containing all introns driven by the native _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ . in day old seedlings _PROTEIN_ promoter derived gus activity was high in roots particularly the root cap root tip root hairs and epidermis of mature regions . low levels were observed in the root elongation zone . a similar _PROTEIN_ pattern was observed in week old seedlings and in transgenic arabidopsis with a transcriptional gus construct . in soil grown mature plants _PROTEIN_ protein was high in roots and low in aerial tissues . after extended staining some gus activity was detected in leaves and flower organs . little _PROTEIN_ was observed in young siliques or seeds . together the predominant and significant accumulation of _PROTEIN_ gus fusion proteins in roots indicates that _PROTEIN_ may contribute to sugar transport in roots . to examine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ we generated transgenic arabidopsis plants stably _PROTEIN_ translational _METHOD_ fusions of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ driven by the native _PROTEIN_ promoter . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions predominantly localized to the tonoplast of root tip cells not coinciding with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . likewise in mature root cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . a tonoplast specific localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was also observed in isolated mesophyll protoplasts . green _METHOD_ lined the inside of stained _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but lined chloroplasts on the side that faces the _LOCATION_ . together dominant _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins on the tonoplast suggest that _PROTEIN_ may function in _LOCATION_ sugar transport . multiple sweets have been shown to mediate glc or suc transport . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ transports sugars _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in the yeast mutant _PROTEIN_ which lacks all endogenous hexose transporters and _LOCATION_ invertase but retains the _LOCATION_ invertase allowing it to grow only on medium containing maltose but not glu . _PROTEIN_ of the yeast hexose transporter can recover the mutant _PROTEIN_ growth on glc containing medium . as one may expect from a transporter that localizes to the tonoplast in yeast _PROTEIN_ did not complement the growth deficiency of _PROTEIN_ on glc containing medium . also frc and galactose did not support detectable growth . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was not detected at significant levels at the yeast _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . similarly the rice homologs and b did not complement a hexose transport deficient yeast mutant . was also found to localize to the tonoplast . the poorly metabolizable deoxyglucose has been used as a sensitive tool for detecting sugar analog transport activity . _PROTEIN_ cells transformed with an empty vector can grow on medium supplemented with dog . by contrast dog inhibited growth in cells _PROTEIN_ . yeast cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed dog dependent growth inhibition compared with cells _PROTEIN_ the empty vector especially on medium buffered at neutral ph indicating that _PROTEIN_ can transport dog . since biased codon usage may reduce heterologous protein _PROTEIN_ we examined the growth of yeast cells _PROTEIN_ a codon optimized _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ . however _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ also did not allow us to detect hexose transport capacity . transport activity was also not observed in radiotracer studies in xenopus oocytes . it is noteworthy that the rice ortholog which also localized to the tonoplast mediated glc transport activity when reconstituted in lipid vesicles supporting the notion that _PROTEIN_ is a tonoplast hexose transporter . high concentrations of glc can result in non enzymatic glycosylation which damages critical proteins and inhibits growth unless the excess reducing sugars are sequestered into the _LOCATION_ . if _PROTEIN_ can transport excess glc into _LOCATION_ as indicated by the yeast growth assays reduced _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ may affect plant growth under excess glc . to test this hypothesis we identified arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ insertion mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . full length _PROTEIN_ transcripts were not detected in the homozygous mutants but were present in the segregating wild type isolated from the mutant populations . while no phenotypic differences were observed at low levels of glc a significant reduction in total leaf area of _PROTEIN_ seedlings was observed in the presence of glc compared with the segregating wild type . _PROTEIN_ thus appears to ameliorate glc toxicity supporting a key function in _LOCATION_ sequestration of glc in arabidopsis roots . disruption of the uptake of glc into _LOCATION_ is expected to reduce sugar storage capacity . we therefore analyzed the sugar content of mature leaves of week old soil grown plants . the glc content was significantly _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mutant leaves compared with the segregating wild type . the amounts of other sugars were also reduced . a reduction in sugar content was also observed in leaves of _PROTEIN_ although to a smaller degree . the significant contribution of _PROTEIN_ to glc accumulation under both excess glc and normal growth conditions is consistent with a role for _PROTEIN_ as an importer of glc into _LOCATION_ for transient storage . since glc is a major component of root exudates and _PROTEIN_ proteins are present at high levels in root epidermal cells we investigated whether altered _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ affects glc efflux activity from roots . seedlings were pre loaded with mm glc for min and then transferred to fresh medium for min . glc radiotracers remaining in seedlings or exported into the medium were analyzed . although total glc uptake was similar in the wild type and mutants the percentage of exported glc derived increased by in all _PROTEIN_ mutants . however when incubated with labeled gal a c epimer of glc no difference in the percentage of _PROTEIN_ efflux between wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutants was observed . efflux kinetics were measured to exclude the possibility of leakage due to damage . seedlings of _PROTEIN_ mutants showed significantly increased efflux percentages compared with wild type seedlings . the increased glc derived efflux from _PROTEIN_ implicates a role for _PROTEIN_ in glc uptake into _LOCATION_ which serve as a buffer that constrains sugar efflux from roots . since sugars exported from roots may serve as _PROTEIN_ supply for rhizospheric microbiota such as the abundant soil borne pathogen pythium spp . we hypothesized that root sugar efflux modulated by _PROTEIN_ may affect susceptibility to root pathogens . we first examined whether _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is affected by infection of the common root pathogen p. irregulare . quantitative rt pcr analysis showed that compared with the other arabidopsis sweet genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts were dramatically induced by more than and fold respectively h after infection . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were induced by more than and fold h after infection . _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were low relative to and were less than a thousandth of the level of _PROTEIN_ . both the abundance and high induction of _PROTEIN_ transcripts in pythium infected roots suggested the possibility that _PROTEIN_ may play a role this root pathogen interaction . to investigate whether local accumulation of _PROTEIN_ correlates with sites of infection we analyzed gus activity in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gus fusions h after pythium infection . compared with non infected controls gus activity increased in infected _PROTEIN_ roots particularly in the tips and elongation regions . induction of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was also observed in roots h after inoculation . moreover _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions localized predominantly to _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in root tip cells indicating that pythium pathogenesis induces the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ at the tonoplast of root cells that are in close vicinity to the pathogen . to test whether _PROTEIN_ contributes to susceptibility we examined the severity of root rot in _PROTEIN_ mutants days after pythium infection . the _PROTEIN_ mutant having an impaired jasmonate signaling pathway was used as a positive control for disease assessment due to its high susceptibility to pythium . compared with wild type plants _PROTEIN_ contained significantly higher numbers of oospores upon co culture . similarly significantly more oospores were observed in _PROTEIN_ mutant roots . moreover the relative dry weight of infected _PROTEIN_ roots was lower than that of infected wild type plants . infected _PROTEIN_ had twice as many wilted and yellowing leaves as wild type plants . increased leaf wilting and senescence was also observed in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . increased oospore colonization and susceptibility of _PROTEIN_ mutants to pythium infection indicates that _PROTEIN_ plays a positive role in the defense mechanism against pythium pathogenesis likely by limiting sugar efflux to the medium/rhizosphere .
