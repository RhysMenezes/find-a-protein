translationally controlled tumour protein _PROTEIN_ a well known protein of the animal kingdom was shown to be a binding protein with important functions in many different cellular processes . however only little is known about _PROTEIN_ in plants . transcript and protein levels of plant _PROTEIN_ were shown to be altered by various stress conditions and arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ was described as an important regulator of growth . the aim of this study was to further characterize plant _PROTEIN_ relating to one of its major functions in animals the protection against cell death . we used two different activators of programmed cell death in plants the mammalian pro apoptotic protein bax and tunicamycin an inhibitor of glycosylation and trigger of unfolded protein response . over _PROTEIN_ of attctp significantly _PROTEIN_ cell death in tobacco leaf discs in both studies . a overlay assay showed attctp to be a binding protein and localization experiments revealed _LOCATION_ distribution of attctp _METHOD_ in arabidopsis seedlings . our study showed cytoprotective effects of plant _PROTEIN_ for the first time . furthermore we showed the ability of attctp to bind to and its _LOCATION_ distribution within the cell . if these results are combined two putative modes of action can be assumed attctp acts as sequester preventing pcd by reducing _LOCATION_ levels as described for animals . attctp could directly or indirectly interact with other _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ bound proteins of the cell death machinery thereby inhibiting cell death progression . as no homologous proteins of the anti apoptotic machinery of animals were found in plants and functional homologues still remain to be elucidated future work will provide more insight .
the effect of attctp on the pro apoptotic effect of bax a member of the bcl family of mouse was tested in tobacco leaves . transient _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana was achieved through agrobacterium tumefaciens and relative ion leakage was measured for cell death quantification . _PROTEIN_ of cytotoxic mouse bax was induced by floating transformed tobacco leaf discs on dexamethasone . attctp was constitutively _PROTEIN_ by the camv promoter . hours after induction of bax _PROTEIN_ an increase in ion leakage was observed that progressively increased until the end of experiment at hours post induction . co _PROTEIN_ of attctp strongly reduced bax mediated cell death . statistical analyses were carried out using analysis of variance and are shown in figure a . _PROTEIN_ of attctp over time

shown in the left panel of figure c bax _PROTEIN_ leaf discs revealed clear signs of chlorosis after hours of incubation on dex whereas attctp over _PROTEIN_ ones did not . co _PROTEIN_ of bax and attctp resulted in slightly chlorotic discs . trypan blue staining used to visualize dead cells within leaf discs provided comparable results . the highest amount of dead cells was found in bax over _PROTEIN_ tissues followed by bax and attctp co _PROTEIN_ tissues and attctp over _PROTEIN_ leaf disc showed almost no dead cells . control experiments using leaf discs floating on dexamethason and _PROTEIN_ either non apoptotic bax _PROTEIN_ or strepii tag without fusion protein or a combination of bax and attctp are shown in figure d. in contrast to full length bax the truncated form lacks the
