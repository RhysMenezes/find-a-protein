ca signaling in downstream effectors is supported by many kinds of ca binding proteins which function as a signal mediator and a ca buffering protein . we found in arabidopsis thaliana a new type of ca binding protein which consists of amino acid residues and binds ca even in the presence of a high concentration of mg . we found two other proteins with similar motifs and . these three proteins had no organelle localization signal and their green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusions were detected in the _LOCATION_ . real time pcr and histochemical analysis of promoter _PROTEIN_ fusions revealed that was predominantly _PROTEIN_ in petioles while was _PROTEIN_ in roots . was hardly _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ of and was enhanced in darkness and became maximal after h. immunoblotting revealed petiole specific accumulation of . _PROTEIN_ of and was suppressed by a high concentration of ca and other metal ions . deletion of sucrose from the medium markedly increased the mrna levels of and within h. gibberellic acid enhanced the _PROTEIN_ of and by and fold respectively after h. and were suppressed in the petiole and the root respectively by light and the product of photosynthesis or both . these results suggest that functions as a mediator in response to continuous dark or gibberellic acid .
was found as a protein with some sequence similarity to rvcab in a search of the arabidopsis database . and were found as homologs of . and are predicted to consist of and amino acid residues respectively . as shown in fig . the three proteins showed in common the abundance of glutamate valine threonine and lysine residues and lack of cysteine glycine tyrosine arginine and tryptophan residues . however the overall sequence identity among the three sequences is relatively low . charged residues comprise of of and of . and contain a characteristic veekk or veeekk motif . most parts of and were predicted to form helices by the method of chou and fasman . protein sequence homology search by the uniprot/swiss prot with a program of _PROTEIN_ gave several proteins with low similarity such as calsequestrin neurofilament triplet proteins and a _PROTEIN_ fruit protein _PROTEIN_ . however ccaps have no calsequestrin consensus motif _METHOD_ . neurofilaments are intermediate filament proteins with high molecular _METHOD_ of kda and kda and their structures are different from that of ccaps . _PROTEIN_ was found in developing fruits of _PROTEIN_ as a glutamate/alanine/proline rich protein although its function is unknown . therefore the three ccaps we identified are novel proteins whose function remains unknown . synthesized in escherichia coli as a recombinant protein migrated as a protein of kda which was higher than the molecular _METHOD_ predicted from the cdna . acidic proteins including rvcab have been reported to migrate slowly on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the antibody raised against the c terminal sequence of clearly reacted with the purified protein at kda in the presence of a final concentration of mm nacl and in the absence of _PROTEIN_ or triton x . the high concentration of nacl was effective for trapping on the transfer _LOCATION_ . the kda immunostained band was not detected with the antibody pre treated with a corresponding antigen peptide indicating the specificity of the antibody to . the purified was clearly stained with the metachromatic cationic _PROTEIN_ dye stains all which has been used for identification of cabps . most of the cabps with acidic motifs to bind ca stain blue with stains all whereas other proteins stain pink and the color fades away quickly in the light . the blue staining pattern suggested that can bind ca . this property of was revealed by ca overlay analysis in the presence of mm mgcl and mm kcl followed by rinsing with ethanol . the purified reproducibly gave a clear positive signal of ca demonstrating the ca binding capacity of in vitro . in this assay calmodulin showed a positive signal and immunoglobulin no signal . to examine the presence of protein among plants we tested the immunoreactivity of soluble fractions prepared from several plants . soluble fractions from radish rose broccoli turnip and chinese cabbage showed an immunostained band at kda with anti antibody . the result suggests that is a protein common to higher plants . to determine the subcellular localization of ccap proteins which are highly charged proteins with no predicted transmembrane domain we prepared dna constructs encoding fusion proteins of and with green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ them transiently in arabidopsis roots and suspension cultured cells . the green _METHOD_ from _METHOD_ was clearly detected in the _LOCATION_ space in both the root and suspension cultured cells . in the control the _METHOD_ of the cells _PROTEIN_ free _METHOD_ was dispersed throughout the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ in both the root and suspension cultured cells . the mrna levels of and were quantified by real time pcr and compared in several organs . was _PROTEIN_ in all organs examined . in this experiment the root contained the bottom part of hypocotyls . was _PROTEIN_ in shoot root stem flower and silique but was hardly _PROTEIN_ in the cauline leaf and rosette leaf . in contrast was _PROTEIN_ predominantly in roots and the mrna level in other organs was < of that in roots . in the present experiment we quantified the copy numbers of each transcript although the data show the relative contents normalized with the rrna content . the amount of mrna in whole plants was < of that of and when quantitated by semi quantitative reverse transcription pcr . the putative promoter regions of about kb were fused in frame with the _PROTEIN_ gene and transformed into arabidopsis . staining for gus activity in week old plants of several independent lines revealed cell specific _PROTEIN_ of ccap genes . there was strong gus activity for in the petiole and the _PROTEIN_ leaf veins and weak gus activity in the root . the gus activity for and was predominantly detected in the root . there was strong gus activity for in endodermis in the stele and for in cambium . immunoblotting of _LOCATION_ fractions from petioles and other organs from week old plants with anti antibody revealed the petiole specific accumulation of the protein . the immunostained band was clearly detected in petiole but not in roots or leaves from which petioles and the _PROTEIN_ leaf vein were removed . we examined the time dependent _PROTEIN_ in a day/night cycle by real time pcr analysis of ccap genes . the mrna levels of and were _PROTEIN_ during the day and increased at night although the amplitude of fluctuations of and mrnas was smaller than that of chl a / b binding protein . the mrna level hardly changed . the mrna levels of and but not that of were markedly increased in the prolonged dark period and reached a maximum after h in darkness . the maximum levels were fold the basal level during the day and the high levels were _PROTEIN_ for h. unlike chl a / b binding protein they did not show a circadian rhythm . the level of protein monitored by immunoblotting was increased during the dark period . therefore the transcript level of might be partly reflected in the protein level . the mrna levels of and in whole plants were _PROTEIN_ by by treatment with mm cacl for h . cacl showed a suppressive effect on the mrna levels even at mm . the suppressive effect of cacl on the mrna in was nullified at h. the mrna levels were examined in plants incubated for h with cacl or other metals at concentrations not affecting their growth . unlike cacl nacl and kcl did not _PROTEIN_ the mrna levels of three ccaps . on the contrary treatment with mm nacl increased the mrna levels of and by and respectively . therefore the suppression of transcription by cacl might not be due to the ionic strength . like calcium magnesium cadmium manganese nickel and zinc also down regulated the three genes . interestingly cocl at mm did not show a suppressive effect . the effect of deficiency of metals on the mrna levels was also examined by changing the growth medium from the metal containing medium to _METHOD_ medium without the corresponding metal . the mrna levels of and were increased by after deletion of mg for h . the mrna levels of and were relatively constant in the absence of ca . since _PROTEIN_ source nutrients affect the _PROTEIN_ of many genes we examined the effect of four different sugars at a concentration of mm . mannitol and sorbitol increased the mrna level of . the mrna level was increased at h of incubation with _PROTEIN_ mannitol or sorbitol . the mrna level of was markedly suppressed by the incubation with these sugars . the mrna levels of and were unaffected by sucrose at mm . on the other hand the mrna was increased fold and remained at a high level when sucrose was depleted from the medium . the mrna level was increased by at h. the mrna level of was markedly lowered by sucrose depletion . among the three phytohormones examined only gibberellic acid increased the mrna levels of and . in particular treatment with gibberellic acid for h increased the transcript level of > fold . salicylic acid and aba showed a suppressive effect on the mrna level of . the flagellin oligopeptide which is the most highly conserved region in the n terminus of eubacterial flagellin induces pathological responses in arabidopsis and other plants . treatment with the flagellin peptide showed no effect on but _PROTEIN_ the and mrna levels . the transcript level of was unaffected by the transfer of week old plantlets grown at to either or but the mrna levels of and were increased fold h after transfer to . dehydration showed no effect on the three genes .
