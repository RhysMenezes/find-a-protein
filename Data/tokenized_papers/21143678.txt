xyloglucan is the dominant hemicellulosic polysaccharide of the primary cell wall of dicotyledonous plants that plays a key role in plant development . it is well established that xyloglucan is assembled within _LOCATION_ stacks and transported in _LOCATION_ derived vesicles to the cell wall . it is also known that the biosynthesis of xyloglucan requires the action of glycosyltransferases including xylosyltransferase galactosyltransferase and fucosyltransferase activities responsible for the addition of xylose galactose and fucose residues to the side chains . there is however a lack of knowledge on how these enzymes are distributed within subcompartments of _LOCATION_ stacks . we have undertaken a study aiming at mapping these glycosyltransferases within _LOCATION_ stacks using immunogold electron microscopy . to this end we generated transgenic lines of tobacco by suspension cultured cells _PROTEIN_ either the xylosyltransferase _PROTEIN_ the galactosyltransferase _PROTEIN_ or the fucosyltransferase _PROTEIN_ of arabidopsis thaliana fused to green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . localization of the fusion proteins within the endomembrane system was assessed using confocal microscopy . additionally tobacco cells were high pressure frozen/freeze substituted and subjected to quantitative immunogold labelling using anti _METHOD_ antibodies to determine the localization patterns of the enzymes within subtypes of _LOCATION_ cisternae . the data demonstrate that all fusion proteins _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are specifically targeted to the _LOCATION_ apparatus and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is _PROTEIN_ located in the cis and medial cisternae _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is predominantly associated with medial cisternae and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mostly detected over trans cisternae suggesting that initiation of xyloglucan side chains occurs in early _LOCATION_ compartments in tobacco cells .
prior to any _PROTEIN_ or localization studies of xyg synthesizing enzymes in by suspension cultured cells we performed a structural analysis of xyg isolated from the cell wall of these cells via the enzymatic oligosaccharide fingerprinting procedure as previously described . the population of xyloglucan oligosaccharides generated by endoglucanase treatment of by cell walls was analyzed by maldi tof _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . as described in suspension cultured cells of nicotiana plumbaginifolia the _PROTEIN_ ions were assigned to adducts of xxgg type xyg fragments partially acetylated and substituted with arabinosyl residues . in addition minor non fucosylated xxxg type oligosaccharides were detected including an acetylated monogalactosylated xxlg or xlxg fragment . to establish the subcellular localization of xyg glycosyltransferases _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaf epidermal cells using confocal microscopy we created _METHOD_ protein fusions of these enzymes . all three glycosyltransferases are type ii _LOCATION_ bound proteins containing a transmembrane domain and supposed to be localized in the _LOCATION_ apparatus . as illustrated in figure transformed tobacco epidermal cells with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ displayed a punctate pattern of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ as would be expected from the dispersed organization of _LOCATION_ stacks in plant cells . to confirm _LOCATION_ localization we co _PROTEIN_ each glycosyltransferase _METHOD_ with the well known _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ marker sialyltransferase _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ in the same epidermal leaf cells . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signals co localized with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ to punctate and mobile structures typical of _LOCATION_ bodies . to investigate the localization of the glycosyltransferases in the _LOCATION_ bodies using transmission electron microscopy we could not use transiently transformed epidermal cells mostly because the transformation yield was very low . we therefore generated stably transformed tobacco suspension cultured by cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at a high level _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . then we also studied the subcellular localization of the three fusion proteins in the stably transformed suspension cultured by cells using confocal imaging . in all cases and as for transiently _PROTEIN_ cells we observed _METHOD_ and mobile spots consistent with _LOCATION_ localization for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . none of the transient or stably transformed cells showed any additional _METHOD_ in any other organelles of the endomembrane system . these data demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ of arabidopsis have _LOCATION_ localization in tobacco leaf epidermal and suspension cultured cells . we first examined the quality of ultrastructural preservation of by suspension cultured cells prepared by high pressure freezing and freeze substitution in acetone containing uranyl acetate and embedded in london resin white for immunocytochemistry . as shown in figure by cells exhibited very well preserved subcellular structures including the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ mitochondria _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ secretory vesicles and _LOCATION_ stacks . in the context of this paper _LOCATION_ stacks were clearly distinguishable and their organization was typical of plant suspension cultured cells . also and as illustrated in figure were consistently discernable based on their very well characterized ultrastructure as previously described . cis cisternae exhibited the most irregular contour were faintly stained and had the widest lumen . medial cisternae had a narrower lumen were more elongated and picked up more stain than cis cisternae . there is often a gradation of luminal staining of the medial cisternae in a cis to trans direction . trans cisternae presented a very thin collapsed lumen that is always densely stained even more than medial cisternae . the trans _LOCATION_ network was observed as a branched tubulo vesicular structure that is frequently but not systematically located close to trans cisternae consistent with previous findings . prior to any investigation of xyg synthesizing enzymes at the electron microscopical level we immunolocalized xyg epitopes in tobacco by suspension cultured cells using confocal imaging and immunogold electron microscopy with the mab ccrc which recognizes non fucosylated xyloglucan . on immunodot assay the ccrc antibody reacted strongly with native tamarind xyg but not with a hydrolyzed sample of the polymer . it also reacted with xyg isolated from tobacco suspension cultured cells . confocal imaging of immunostained cells with the mab ccrc showed a punctate _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ and a quite uniform staining at the cell surface . this is consistent with the ccrc recognized xyg associated epitopes being located in _LOCATION_ stacks and cell wall two compartments where xyg is known to occur . immunogold labelling of cryo fixed by cultured cells showed xyg epitopes over _LOCATION_ stacks and in the cell wall . gold particles were _PROTEIN_ found over medial and trans cisternae the trans _LOCATION_ network and _LOCATION_ derived transport vesicles . also labelling of the cell wall was mostly associated with the closest zone to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in contrast no labelling was found in by cells using the mab ccrc specific for an l fucp d galp epitope of xyg consistent with the previously published data showing that tobacco xyg does not contain fucosyl residues . once we confirmed _LOCATION_ localization of xyg epitopes and glycosyltransferases using confocal microscopy we investigated distribution of the enzymes within _LOCATION_ cisternae using immunogold electron microscopy . labelling of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was performed by employing anti _METHOD_ antibodies in stably transformed by cells prepared by hpf/fs technique . immunogold labelling was quantified over each _LOCATION_ cisterna _LOCATION_ and subjected to chi squared test to check for labelling specificity in transformed by cells versus wild type . the relative labelling index was also determined to evaluate specific gold particles distribution within different subtypes of _LOCATION_ cisternae . immunogold labelling of _LOCATION_ stacks of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic by cultured cells with anti _METHOD_ antibodies is illustrated in figure . gold particles were _PROTEIN_ localized over cis and medial _LOCATION_ cisternae and also in transport vesicles associated with _LOCATION_ margins . quantification of labelling and chi square test were performed to confirm the specificity of the signal in cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ by versus wild type cells . the total chi squared value was found to be superior to that of the contingency table indicating that labelling is specific in _LOCATION_ stacks . in addition distribution of _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ within subtypes of _LOCATION_ cisternae in transformed cells was assigned based on rli determination . the rli values for cis and medial cisternae were found to be superior to indicating a specific and preferential labelling of these two _LOCATION_ compartments with anti _METHOD_ antibodies . quantification of labelling was done on _LOCATION_ stacks for each line . the total chi squared value compared with that of contingency table analysis with a degree of freedom of _METHOD_ specificity of gold particles distribution between wild type and transformed cells . aidentify _LOCATION_ compartments that are preferentially labelled . localization of _PROTEIN_ was performed using the same procedure . immunogold labelling of _LOCATION_ stacks of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic by cultured cells with anti _METHOD_ antibodies is shown in figure . gold particles were also _PROTEIN_ localised in _LOCATION_ stacks and seemed to be preferentially in the medial _LOCATION_ cisternae . quantification of labelling and chi square tests were performed as for cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the total chi squared value was found to be greater than that of the contingency table indicating that labelling in _LOCATION_ stacks is specific . in addition analysis of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ distribution based on rli determination indicates a preferential labelling of medial cisternae . quantification of labelling was done on _LOCATION_ stacks for each line . the total chi squared value compared with that of contingency table analysis with a degree of freedom of _METHOD_ specificity of gold particles distribution between wild type and transformed cells . aidentify _LOCATION_ compartments that are preferentially labeled . quantification of immunogold labelling of _LOCATION_ stacks in transgenic by cultured cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and a chi squared test were performed as for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the total chi squared value was found to be superior compared with that of the contingency table indicating that labelling in _LOCATION_ stacks is specific . the rli values were found to be for cis cisternae for medial cisternae for trans cisternae and for the tgn . the data indicate a preferential labelling of trans _LOCATION_ cisternae as the rli is superior to . together the immunogold labelling data coupled to quantitative and statistical analysis of the binding pattern of _METHOD_ indicate that in tobacco by suspension cultured cells the _PROTEIN_ is mostly located in cis and medial cisternae whereas _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are predominantly associated with medial and trans _LOCATION_ cisternae respectively .
