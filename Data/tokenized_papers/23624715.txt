elongated _PROTEIN_ is a basic domain/leucine zipper _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ central for the regulation of seedling photomorphogenesis . here we identified a b box _PROTEIN_ containing protein _PROTEIN_ tolerance homolog as an interacting partner of _PROTEIN_ which has been previously found to physically interact with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ physically interacts with _PROTEIN_ both in vitro and in vivo . by physiological and genetic approaches we showed that _PROTEIN_ is a negative regulator of seedling photomorphogenesis . _PROTEIN_ and its homolog _PROTEIN_ regulate deetiolation processes and hypocotyl shade avoidance response in an additive manner . moreover genetic relationships of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with and _PROTEIN_ revealed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ additively enhance _PROTEIN_ and suppress _PROTEIN_ functions . _PROTEIN_ accumulates in a light dependent manner and undergoes _PROTEIN_ mediated degradation in dark and light conditions . furthermore a protoplast cotransfection assay showed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ repress _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by interfering with _PROTEIN_ transcriptional activity . as _PROTEIN_ binds to the _PROTEIN_ promoter and promotes its _PROTEIN_ our results identify a direct mechanism through which the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is regulated . we suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function as transcriptional corepressors probably by forming inactive heterodimers with _PROTEIN_ downregulating _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ for the fine tuning of light mediated seedling development .
_PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have been reported to physically and genetically interact with _PROTEIN_ . since _PROTEIN_ shares amino acid sequence similarity with _PROTEIN_ we examined whether _PROTEIN_ also interacts with _PROTEIN_ using full length and truncated versions of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ of full length and mutated versions of _PROTEIN_ and full length _PROTEIN_ were confirmed by immunoblotting . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ together with dbd alone did not activate transcription but when _PROTEIN_ with dbd _PROTEIN_ resulted in an fold increase in galactosidase activity compared with that of the vector control . previous reports suggest that the b boxes in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are necessary for the interaction with _PROTEIN_ . to see whether the b boxes in _PROTEIN_ were also required for the interaction with _PROTEIN_ we individually substituted two conserved asp residues in the b boxes to ala . the substituted proteins in _PROTEIN_ were named and and . whereas the substitution in resulted in a drastic reduction in galactosidase activity substitutions in and and resulted in complete abolition of the interaction compared with wild type levels . consistent with the yeast two hybrid results in vitro pull down assays also demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ . these assays showed that _PROTEIN_ was not able to pull down the mutated versions of _PROTEIN_ but that it was able to pull down wild type _PROTEIN_ . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ through its b boxes . to determine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ and to further characterize its interactions with _PROTEIN_ we examined whether _PROTEIN_ physically interacts with _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ using _METHOD_ resonance energy transfer . the cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fused to _PROTEIN_ and yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fused to _PROTEIN_ were coexpressed in onion epidermal cells and checked for the occurrence of fret . the bleaching of the acceptor _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ resulted in an increased emission from _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ indicating that fret had occurred between the two proteins prior to the bleach . however in control photobleaching experiments using the same microscope settings we detected no fret between untagged _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . furthermore to map which domain of _PROTEIN_ is responsible for the interaction with _PROTEIN_ we used different truncated versions of _PROTEIN_ fused to the dna binding domain dbd . _PROTEIN_ of the truncated versions of _PROTEIN_ was confirmed by immunoblot . quantitative measurements of galactosidase activity indicated that _PROTEIN_ strongly interacts with the full length version of _PROTEIN_ and the truncated version of _PROTEIN_ . however deletion of the _PROTEIN_ domain in _PROTEIN_ resulted in a drastic reduction of galactosidase activity suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ domain of _PROTEIN_ is necessary and sufficient to mediate the interaction with _PROTEIN_ . collectively the results from yeast two hybrid pull down and fret experiments demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ physically interacts with _PROTEIN_ . to examine the physiological role of _PROTEIN_ in light mediated seedling development we obtained two independent t dna insertion lines for _PROTEIN_ and designated them as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . genotyping and sequencing of both t dna lines revealed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have t dna insertions in the promoter and in the first intron of the gene respectively . the rna gel blot results showed that the _PROTEIN_ mutant carried a null allele of _PROTEIN_ whereas the _PROTEIN_ mutant showed reduced _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ transcripts compared with the columbia wild type . since _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is light modulated we monitored the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in d old dark grown wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings exposed to white light between and h. in wild type seedlings _PROTEIN_ transcripts were fold increased at h of light reached fold maximum _PROTEIN_ at h of light and then gradually _PROTEIN_ . by contrast the _PROTEIN_ mutant showed a reduced fivefold increase at h of light and the fold _PROTEIN_ peak was detected after h of light . in addition d old _PROTEIN_ seedlings grown in constant wl accumulated half of the wild type transcripts providing further evidence for a reduced _PROTEIN_ activity in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is a reduced functional allele of _PROTEIN_ . to carry out a detailed phenotypic analysis of the role of _PROTEIN_ in response to light we studied the phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines and mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . col _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and seedlings were grown in different light conditions for d to examine the hypocotyl length . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings displayed significantly shorter hypocotyls whereas _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines showed larger hypocotyls than col seedlings in wl and monochromatic light conditions . we concluded that _PROTEIN_ is directly involved in light signaling and functions as a negative regulator of seedling photomorphogenesis irrespective of light quality . to see whether _PROTEIN_ has functions overlapping with those of _PROTEIN_ we generated and characterized a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . the hypocotyl of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant seedlings was significantly shorter than that of each of the single mutants thus suggesting an additive genetic interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ independently of the light treatment . in addition d old wild type seedlings showed low levels of anthocyanin in all light conditions whereas _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutant seedlings showed an increase of in their anthocyanin levels and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant seedlings an increase of > compared with wild type seedlings . again the stronger enhancement of anthocyanin accumulation in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ compared with single mutants indicates that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ act additively . to investigate the genetic relationship between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we generated a homozygous _PROTEIN_ double mutant . whereas seedlings showed longer hypocotyls than wild type seedlings _PROTEIN_ double mutant seedlings showed slightly but significantly shorter hypocotyls than in wl and even in r and bl . these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ function is partially _PROTEIN_ dependent . to understand this phenomenon further we generated a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutant . the triple mutant had significantly shorter hypocotyls than the _PROTEIN_ double mutant in wl and different monochromatic light conditions . taken together these results suggest that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ can partially and additively suppress the hypocotyl phenotype . since the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant accumulates significantly more anthocyanin than the single mutants we wanted to know whether enhanced anthocyanin accumulation in the double mutant is _PROTEIN_ dependent . although the anthocyanin content in is extremely low in wl the absence of _PROTEIN_ and/or _PROTEIN_ in the background induces the accumulation of anthocyanin achieving wild type levels in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutant . by contrast the anthocyanin content was comparable to that of in double and triple mutant seedlings grown under monochromatic light conditions . _PROTEIN_ of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes such as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ further _METHOD_ the anthocyanin content results . col seedlings grown in the dark for d and then treated with wl for and h showed increased _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant the _PROTEIN_ of both genes was two to threefold higher than that of the wild type and null _PROTEIN_ was detected in the single mutant . moreover _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutant seedlings showed a slight but significant recovery of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ compared with but not under r fr and bl conditions . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ regulate anthocyanin gene _PROTEIN_ in a _PROTEIN_ dependent manner . since _PROTEIN_ is a central negative regulator of photomorphogenesis we investigated whether _PROTEIN_ alone and together with _PROTEIN_ influence the _PROTEIN_ phenotype . we used two weak _PROTEIN_ alleles _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to generate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants . five day old dark grown _PROTEIN_ seedlings displayed a strong photomorphogenic phenotype whereas the hypocotyls of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and of their respective single mutants were indistinguishable from the wild type ones . by contrast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings showed shorter hypocotyls than _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . to further investigate the genetic action of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ on _PROTEIN_ signaling we constructed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutants . five day old dark grown seedlings of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed hypocotyls and shorter respectively than their corresponding _PROTEIN_ single mutants . similar results were found when seedlings were grown in different light conditions . these results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ additively enhance the _PROTEIN_ hypocotyl phenotype in dark and light conditions . the _PROTEIN_ mutant accumulates more anthocyanin in both dark and light conditions . while neither the _PROTEIN_ nor the _PROTEIN_ single mutants showed altered anthocyanin levels the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant accumulated slightly but significantly more anthocyanin than the wild type in the dark . even more _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants showed an increase of and in anthocyanin content respectively and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutants showed an increase of and in anthocyanin content over their respective _PROTEIN_ alleles . the anthocyanin levels correlated well with the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts in d old dark grown seedlings . these results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ act additively in the _PROTEIN_ signaling pathway of hypocotyl length anthocyanin accumulation and gene _PROTEIN_ . to know how _PROTEIN_ protein stability is regulated and whether or not _PROTEIN_ has any role in the modulation of its stability we generated transgenic lines overexpressing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in col and _PROTEIN_ mutant background . overexpression of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ background but not in col led to longer hypocotyls in the dark . four day old dark grown seedlings were either mock treated with _METHOD_ or treated with the proteasome specific inhibitor and then kept in the dark for h more . immunoblot experiments showed that _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was clearly visible in the treated seedlings but not in mock treated seedlings . similarly when d old dark grown seedlings were treated with and h of wl the _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was found to be more stable with than that of the mock treated seedlings suggesting that can block the degradation of _PROTEIN_ even in light conditions . to know whether _PROTEIN_ degradation is mediated by _PROTEIN_ we examined the _PROTEIN_ fusion protein in _PROTEIN_ mutant background . four day old dark grown seedlings were either mock treated or treated with and incubated either in the dark or wl for h and subjected to immunoblot analysis . the _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was clearly visible in both dark and wl grown seedlings either mock treated or treated with indicating that _PROTEIN_ is mediating _PROTEIN_ degradation through the proteasome pathway . furthermore the increased stability of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mutant background is not due to an increase in _PROTEIN_ transcript levels . in order to find target genes of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we analyzed the _PROTEIN_ of light regulated genes like _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in d dark grown col and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings treated with wl for and h. quantitative rt pcr analysis showed that among the genes tested only _PROTEIN_ showed significantly higher _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ than in col seedlings . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ together negatively regulate the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . previously it has been shown that _PROTEIN_ promotes the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ by directly binding to its promoter and that _PROTEIN_ ubiquitylates and degrades _PROTEIN_ protein in the dark . furthermore _PROTEIN_ physically and genetically interacts with _PROTEIN_ and enhances the function of _PROTEIN_ by regulating hypocotyl growth and anthocyanin accumulation . to study in detail how the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ could be affected in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single and double mutants we monitored the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in seedlings exposed to wl between and h. _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ increased in a light dependent manner with a peak at around h and then _PROTEIN_ to levels similar to those at h . whereas the induction of _PROTEIN_ in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutants was found to be slightly elevated compared with col the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant showed nearly twofold higher _PROTEIN_ accumulation than single mutants suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ act additively to downregulate the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . next we asked whether the negative regulation of _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is through the altered stability of _PROTEIN_ and/or _PROTEIN_ . protein extracts of col _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants of d old wl grown seedlings were subjected to immunoblot analysis . neither _PROTEIN_ nor _PROTEIN_ was altered in the single and double mutants compared with col suggesting that the increased _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant is independent of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ protein levels . furthermore we evaluated whether the negative regulation of _PROTEIN_ could be due to an altered _PROTEIN_ action . to this end we fused bp of the _PROTEIN_ promoter to the luciferase reporter gene . the luc reporter was transfected into mesophyll protoplasts along with rnluc and the effectors _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in different combinations . the _PROTEIN_ promoter activity was null for the vector control _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ effectors . however the cotransfection of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with luc resulted in fold activation of the _PROTEIN_ promoter whereas the cotransfection of _PROTEIN_ with either _PROTEIN_ or moderately induced the _PROTEIN_ promoter activity . these results suggest _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ repress the activation of _PROTEIN_ promoter activity by interfering with _PROTEIN_ action . since both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ physically interact with _PROTEIN_ through its _PROTEIN_ domain they probably reduce the function of _PROTEIN_ by forming inactive heterodimers . in _PROTEIN_ the results demonstrate that the mutated version of _PROTEIN_ is not able to form heterodimers with _PROTEIN_ . sas is an _PROTEIN_ strategy that triggers plant elongation responses in low r fr light to escape from shade and reach out to the sunlight . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ act as negative _PROTEIN_ for hypocotyl growth in dark conditions . furthermore the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutant can partially restore the sas phenotype suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ together interact genetically and antagonistically with _PROTEIN_ under sas . to understand the genetic relationship between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the sas pathway we studied the single double and triple mutant phenotypes under simulated shade conditions . in high r fr light _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ displayed hypocotyl elongation similar to that of the wild type . however _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ mutants showed significantly shorter hypocotyls than col seedlings in low r fr . furthermore the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant is significantly shorter than _PROTEIN_ specifically under shade conditions . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are partially redundant in the promotion of the hypocotyl shade avoidance response . in addition and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings had longer hypocotyls than the wild type both in high and low r fr suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is not involved in hypocotyl elongation by shade . we also explored the genetic relationship between _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings displayed significantly shorter hypocotyls than wild type ones both in high and low r fr and _PROTEIN_ and/or _PROTEIN_ mutations in _PROTEIN_ backgrounds displayed the same phenotypes as _PROTEIN_ indicating that the functions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ under shade are completely dependent on _PROTEIN_ .
the mutants used in this study were _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ alleles are in the col accession . seeds were surface sterilized and plated on murashige and skoog medium supplemented with bactoagar and suc . the plates were then cold treated at for d and then transferred to light chambers _PROTEIN_ at with the desired wavelength and intensity of light . for all monochromatic light assays the plates were transferred to continuous wl for h to induce uniform germination . the plates were then transferred to monochromatic light conditions incubated at for the indicated number of days and measured essentially as previously described . physiological experiments were repeated two or three times and only a representative one is shown . for genotyping of homozygous _PROTEIN_ the t dna primer was used along with gene specific primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ whereas for _PROTEIN_ genotyping transposon specific primer was used along with gene specific primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . for homozygous _PROTEIN_ genotyping the t dna primer was used along with gene specific primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . for the generation of double and triple mutants first _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were crossed to generate the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant was crossed with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and to obtain . through phenotyping and genotyping of plants we identified different double _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and triple _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant combinations . to generate transgenic lines overexpressing _PROTEIN_ the full length _PROTEIN_ coding sequence was amplified by pcr from cdna of d old light grown col seedlings using the primers _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ and cloned into the vector with ncoi bglii sites . the _PROTEIN_ cassette was subcloned into the binary vector which was then transformed into the agrobacterium tumefaciens strain and then into col plants by the floral dip method . in plants several independent transgenic lines carrying a single copy transgene were identified and two of them were selected for further analysis . for yeast two hybrid experiments we cloned full length and mutated versions of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cdna into the yeast _PROTEIN_ vector and full length _PROTEIN_ cdna into the dna binding domain vector _PROTEIN_ . the constructs used for _PROTEIN_ are described elsewhere . we

length and truncated versions of _PROTEIN_ proteins were examined by immunoblotting using anti dbd antibody . the galactosidase assays were performed as described by citation in yeast strain . for the fret acceptor photobleaching experiments the pam _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and pam _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ constructs were introduced into onion epidermal cells by particle bombardment and

equipped with an lsm meta laser scanning confocal imaging system . the multitracking mode was used to eliminate spillover between _METHOD_ channels . the _METHOD_ was excited by a diode laser and the _METHOD_ by an argon ion laser both at low intensities . after increasing the intensity of the nm laser the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ from the acceptor _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was bleached . the bleaching of the acceptor resulted in an increased emission from _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ indicating that fret had occurred between the two proteins prior to the bleach . similarly in control photobleaching experiments using the microscopic settings fret between untagged _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ was examined . regions of interest were selected and bleached with iterations using the argon ion laser at . at least different _LOCATION_ were subjected to fret and average intensities before and after bleaching were plotted on the graph . in vitro protein protein interaction studies were performed as described by citation with some modifications . wild type and mutated dna fragments encoding full length _PROTEIN_ were cloned into the vector to generate a c terminal fusion . the full length coding sequence of

four times with the same buffer . the proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in equal volume of _PROTEIN_ buffer and loaded onto a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gel and the proteins were detected using anti his antibodies _PROTEIN_ . for the analysis of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein dynamics in hypocotyl cell _LOCATION_ at least to seedlings grown in the respective growth conditions were subjected to

signal west pico chemiluminescent substrate kit following the instructions described in the user s manual . protein extracts were prepared from wild type mutant or transgenic seedlings . approximately mg of seedlings was harvested in a microcentrifuge tube frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground in ml of grinding buffer and _METHOD_ was added . the protein extract was centrifuged at rpm for min to pellet the debris . the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and an aliquot of ml was taken out in a separate tube to estimate protein concentration by bradford assay . proteins were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . prestained protein markers were used for molecular _METHOD_ determination . the samples were then transferred to hybond c extra at ma for h in trans blot semidry transfer apparatus following the manufacturer s protocol . the _LOCATION_ was blocked with milk in _PROTEIN_ and probed with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ or antiactin monoclonal antibodies . for the protoplast assay arabidopsis thaliana mesophyll cell protoplasts were prepared and transfected as described by citation . the promoter reporter used was a bp fragment of the _PROTEIN_ promoter driving firefly luciferase _PROTEIN_ . full length _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ driven by a cauliflower mosaic virus promoter _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were used as the effectors . for the reporter detection the dual luciferase system was used . renilla luciferase driven by a full length cauliflower mosaic virus promoter was used as an internal control . to characterize the nature of the mutations in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we studied the _PROTEIN_ of mrna in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant genotypes grown for d under h h dark and harvested just before dawn when the transcripts are reportedly high . total rna was extracted from d old plants grown in a h h dark cycle using the rneasy plant mini kit and was loaded for the rna gel blot analysis . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ c terminal fragments were used as probes to detect transcript levels in the wild type and different _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant backgrounds . for quantitative pcr analysis rna was extracted from wl and red light treated d old seedlings using the rneasy plant mini kit and rna was subjected to on column dnase i digestion following the manufacturer s instructions . rna was converted into cdna using the revert aid h minus first strand cdna synthesis kit . the cdna was diluted with sterile mq water . the reaction was set up in volume with of template using the itaq fast sybr green pcr master mix kit _METHOD_ . quantitative pcr was performed on an optical well plate in an abi prism real time pcr system _METHOD_ . the thermal cycle used was for min followed by cycles of for s for s and for s. gene specific primer pairs were designed using and blast software from the national center for biotechnology information . anthocyanin content was measured as described by citation . for shade experiments we used a light growth chamber with mercury lamps _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under a long day photoperiod at . seedlings were grown for d under wl with a high r fr or exposed to low r fr obtained by incandescent lamps _PROTEIN_ covered by paolini filters and placed _PROTEIN_ into the growth chamber . spectral photon fluences
