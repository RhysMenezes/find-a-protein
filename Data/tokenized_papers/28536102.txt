the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ ubiquitin ligase is a central repressor that suppresses light signaling in darkness by targeting positive regulators of the light response _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ for degradation . light inactivates _PROTEIN_ in part by excluding _PROTEIN_ from the _LOCATION_ . spa proteins are essential cofactors of _PROTEIN_ but their exact role in the _PROTEIN_ complex is thus far unknown . to unravel a potential role of spa proteins in _PROTEIN_ nucleocytoplasmic partitioning we monitored the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ in a _PROTEIN_ quadruple mutant . we analyzed a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic line and endogenous _PROTEIN_ after subcellular fractionation . in dark grown seedlings both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and endogenous _PROTEIN_ accumulated in the _LOCATION_ in the absence and presence of spa proteins indicating that spa proteins are not required for _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ in darkness . in contrast in white light grown seedlings spaqn mutants failed to relocalize _PROTEIN_ from the _LOCATION_ to the cytoplasm . hence spa proteins are necessary for the light controlled change in _PROTEIN_ subcellular localization . we conclude that spa proteins have a dual role they are required for light responsiveness of _PROTEIN_ subcellular localization and they promote _PROTEIN_ activity in darkness in a fashion that is independent of the _LOCATION_ import/nuclear retention of _PROTEIN_ .
since spa proteins are essential for _PROTEIN_ function in darkness we asked whether spa proteins are required for the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ in dark grown seedlings . to this end we crossed the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgene into the spaqn mutant background that carries null alleles of all four arabidopsis spa genes . as a control we first analyzed _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localization in the progenitor line that is in a spa wild type background . distinct _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ photobodies were detected in the hypocotyl _LOCATION_ of dark grown seedlings whereas no such signal was detected in hypocotyls of seedlings grown in continuous white light . the weak round shaped signals localized outside the _LOCATION_ of light grown seedlings were background signals likely derived from chloroplasts since they were equally found in nontransgenic wild type seedlings . the disappearance of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ from the _LOCATION_ in wc was not due to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ degradation since total _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ levels were not lowered by wc treatment . in total these results are in close agreement with previous findings . in spaqn _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings grown in darkness _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ photobodies were observed that were very similar to those observed in the parental _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ line . thus spa proteins are not essential for _LOCATION_ accumulation and photobody formation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . while no visual change in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ photobody formation was detected between spa wild type and spaqn backgrounds there might still be a quantitative difference in the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ accumulation in the dark . to investigate this possibility _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ intensity was measured in hypocotyl _LOCATION_ of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings . to this end we generated dimensional images from dapi stained hypocotyl cells of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings using confocal microscopy . detecting both dapi and _METHOD_ signals in these stacks allowed us to measure _METHOD_ _METHOD_ intensities within the dimensional space of a _LOCATION_ . in a spa wild type background _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ intensity was strongly reduced in wc grown seedlings when compared to dark grown seedlings thus confirming the visual impression shown in figure . when comparing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ intensity in _LOCATION_ of dark grown _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and spaqn _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings no dramatic difference was observed . especially considering that total _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ levels were somewhat reduced in dark grown spaqn when compared to the spa wild type background these results confirm that _LOCATION_ accumulation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is not impaired by the absence of spa proteins . we subsequently assessed _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ subcellular localization in hypocotyl cells of wc grown seedlings . as shown above _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ did not form detectable photobodies in a spa wild type background . however notably in the spaqn background many _LOCATION_ localized _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ speckles were observed . _METHOD_ intensity quantification confirmed that the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signal was significantly higher in spaqn when compared to the spa wild type background . this increase in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ of spaqn seedlings is not due to impaired _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein degradation because total levels of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were lower rather than higher in wc grown spaqn than in spa wild type seedlings . when directly comparing _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in dark and wc grown spaqn seedlings there was no detectable difference in photobody formation and the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signal intensity was even higher in wc than in darkness . taken together these results suggest that light regulated nucleocytoplasmic partitioning of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is strongly impaired in the spaqn background . the observations made using the transgenic _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ line suggest that spa proteins are required for light induced _LOCATION_ exclusion of _PROTEIN_ . we further tested this hypothesis by analyzing endogenous _PROTEIN_ levels in _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ fractions derived from biochemical fractionation experiments . in the wild type the abundance of _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in wc grown seedlings when compared to dark grown seedlings while concomitantly the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ levels increased in wc when compared to darkness . this finding is consistent with results obtained previously and _METHOD_ that _PROTEIN_ is excluded from the _LOCATION_ in the light . in the spaqn mutant light did not cause a dramatic change in _PROTEIN_ levels in the _LOCATION_ fraction or in the _LOCATION_ fraction . importantly light exposure did not cause a reduction in _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ levels . similarly _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ levels were not increased by light in spaqn . no major differences in total _PROTEIN_ levels were detected between wild type and spaqn seedlings suggesting that differences observed in _PROTEIN_ subcellular localization between wild type and spaqn are not due to differential _PROTEIN_ protein stability . in total these results indicate that nucleocytoplasmic partitioning of the _PROTEIN_ protein was strongly impaired in light grown spaqn mutant seedlings . taken together these results agree with the observations made using the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings and thus indicate that spa proteins are not important for _LOCATION_ accumulation of _PROTEIN_ in darkness but are instead important for the light response of _PROTEIN_ that is for dissolving _PROTEIN_ photobodies and for excluding _PROTEIN_ from the _LOCATION_ in the light . when analyzed in a gus _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ line _LOCATION_ exclusion appeared to be strongest in white light but was also induced to varying degrees by frc rc and bc . these results combined with the finding that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ still formed speckles in hypocotyl cells of wc grown seedlings in the spaqn background motivated us to investigate the _LOCATION_ accumulation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the spaqn mutant grown in monochromatic light . to this end we grew seedlings _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the spa wild type and the spaqn mutant backgrounds in rc frc and bc . in the spa wild type background _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ speckles were not detectable in both frc and bc that is frc and bc grown seedlings appeared similar to wc grown seedlings . in contrast we detected strong _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ accumulation in rc in this line with photobody formation that was at least as strong as in darkness . microscopy of spaqn _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings grown in these light conditions revealed the formation of speckles in both rc and frc while we were not able to detect _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ speckles in bc grown seedlings . hence frc exposure similar to wc exposure abolished _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ photobody formation in a spa dependent manner . in rc _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ speckle formation did not change when compared to dark grown seedlings neither in the spa wild type nor in the spaqn mutant background suggesting that rc exposure was not sufficient to exclude _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ from the _LOCATION_ in this transgenic line . we used the maximum fluence rate of rc that can be produced by our _PROTEIN_ light sources which should be sufficient to fully activate _PROTEIN_ . in bc _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ speckles were absent in both the spa wild type and the spaqn mutant background indicating that removal of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ from the _LOCATION_ in bc is spa independent . taken together these results suggest a complex coaction of various photoreceptors in the control of nucleo cytoplasmic partitioning of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ .
