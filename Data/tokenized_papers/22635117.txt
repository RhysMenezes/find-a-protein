cytokinesis is the process of partitioning the cytoplasm of a dividing cell thereby completing mitosis . cytokinesis in the plant cell is achieved by the formation of a new cell wall between daughter _LOCATION_ using components carried in _LOCATION_ derived vesicles that accumulate at the midplane of the phragmoplast and fuse to form the cell plate . proteins that play major roles in the development of the cell plate in plant cells are not well defined . here we report that an _PROTEIN_ amino terminal homology/epsin amino terminal homology domain containing protein from arabidopsis is involved in clathrin coated vesicle formation from the cell plate . arabidopsis epsin like clathrin _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and its homologous proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ localize to the growing cell plate in cells undergoing cytokinesis and also to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and endosomes in nondividing cells . _PROTEIN_ does not localize to nascent cell plates but localizes at higher levels to expanding cell plates even after the cell plate fuses with the parental _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the temporal and spatial localization patterns of _PROTEIN_ overlap most closely with those of the clathrin light chain . in vitro protein interaction assays revealed that _PROTEIN_ binds to the clathrin h chain via its _PROTEIN_ terminal domain . these results suggest that these _PROTEIN_ amino terminal homology/epsin amino terminal homology domain containing proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may function as _PROTEIN_ of clathrin coated vesicles budding from the cell plate .
the arabidopsis genome encodes proteins with an a/enth domain . phylogenetic analysis revealed that they can be grouped into five to six subfamilies . to gain insight into the role of these proteins in plant cells the cellular localization of arabidopsis a/enth domain containing proteins was determined . initially three genes were selected _GENE_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ named _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . these were fused to the n terminus of _METHOD_ for in vivo localization . the _METHOD_ fusion constructs _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were transformed into protoplasts from leaf tissues of arabidopsis using polyethylene glycol mediated transformation . h _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was cotransformed with the ateca _METHOD_ constructs to provide a counterstain for the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in the protoplasts all three _METHOD_ fusion proteins closely overlapped with h _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ indicating that atecas localize to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . punctate spots were observed along the cell periphery but it was not clear whether the spots were at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or in the _LOCATION_ strands compressed between the central _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . these results contrast with the previous study of and which were clearly associated with _LOCATION_ foci and thought to play roles in _LOCATION_ trafficking pathways . the current observations of ateca _METHOD_ localization suggest that these proteins may be involved in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ associated processes . to confirm the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization of these proteins transgenic plants transformed with the _METHOD_ fusion constructs were generated . the _PROTEIN_ of intact _METHOD_ fusion proteins was verified by immunoblot analysis . an anti _METHOD_ antibody detected and kd polypeptides that match the expected sizes of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ respectively . next the in vivo localization of _METHOD_ proteins in the root tip was examined . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in endosomes and in the _LOCATION_ in the transgenic root samples with each reporter displaying different subcellular localization intensities . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ associated mostly with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ whereas _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was more densely populated at endosomes than at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ appeared primarily in the _LOCATION_ with a weak signal at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and endosomes . in dividing cells all these proteins accumulated at the cell plate _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ exhibited the strongest _METHOD_ signal at the cell plate followed by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . we thus focused the ensuing investigation on _PROTEIN_ . to rule out the possibility that the _PROTEIN_ of ateca _METHOD_ driven by the strong cauliflower mosaic virus or cassava vein mosaic virus promoter may perturb normal localization _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was also _PROTEIN_ under the control of its native promoter to ensure that its localization pattern was identical to that observed with the camv promoter . the localization of endogenous _PROTEIN_ was further examined with an anti _PROTEIN_ antibody raised against recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli . when root tip tissues of wild type plants were probed with the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody _PROTEIN_ specific _METHOD_ was observed at _LOCATION_ punctae the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the cell plate which is consistent with the localization pattern of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in transgenic _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants the anti _PROTEIN_ positive signals overlapped with _METHOD_ signals of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ confirming that overexpressed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the endogenous _PROTEIN_ have the same localization behaviors . to test whether the ateca _METHOD_ positive _LOCATION_ punctate spots correspond to endosomes colocalization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the lipophilic endocytic tracer was examined . the tgn functions as the early endosome in plant cells and labels the tgn within several minutes . brefeldin a a fungal compound known to inhibit arf gef activity causes an aggregation of endosomes known as the bfa compartment . these properties of ees were utilized to determine the identity of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ positive structures . root tissues of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants were labeled with and localization was examined after min . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ overlapped with _METHOD_ at the endosomes and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . when root tissues were treated with bfa both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and positive compartments were enriched in the bfa compartment indicating that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is associated with the ee . to further investigate the identity of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ compartment the localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was compared with the localization of known organelle proteins . the clathrin light chain localizes to the tgn/ee and to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ is another tgn/ee marker protein . plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were crossed to plants _PROTEIN_ clc morange and to plants _PROTEIN_ monomeric _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and the subcellular localization of _METHOD_ proteins was examined . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ colocalized well with both tgn/ee markers . however _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not colocalize with _PROTEIN_ a component of _PROTEIN_ vesicles of the _LOCATION_ that was detected with an anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . neither did _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ colocalize with prevacuolar compartment marker proteins including mcherry _PROTEIN_ and atvsr . these results show that _PROTEIN_ localizes to the tgn/ees but not to the _LOCATION_ apparatus or the prevacuolar compartment . varying levels of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulation on cell plates suggested that the distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ changes as the cell plate grows as is the case for other proteins that relocate to the developing cell plate . therefore the distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in root meristematic cells was monitored in conjunction with dna visualization using diamino phenylindole because stages of mitosis and cytokinesis could be differentiated by the varying morphological features of dapi stained _LOCATION_ dna . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was primarily localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ until anaphase with a minor portion localized to the endosomes . accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at the division plane was first observed during early telophase when the cell plate starts to form and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ remained associated with the cell plate until the end of cytokinesis . however the _METHOD_ intensity at the cell plate was reduced in the _PROTEIN_ stages of cytokinesis and it appeared to relocate to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of the daughter cells as the cell plate matured . the dynamic colocalization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and was examined by time lapse imaging . is targeted to young cell plates in plant cells undergoing cytokinesis . at min both and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ yielded strong _METHOD_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . at min was observed as a small line at the center of the cell indicating that localizes to the nascent cell plate . however at this time point _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was barely detectable at the cell plate . at min the growing cell plate had expanded _PROTEIN_ and was labeled by both and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . at subsequent time points the two _METHOD_ signals overlapped in the growing cell plate . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is involved in the expansion and maturation of the cell plate rather than in the early stage of formation when _LOCATION_ derived vesicles fuse with each other . to gain further insight into the role of atecas in cell plate formation the localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the cell plate was compared with that of other cell plate proteins . _PROTEIN_ a cell plate specific snare is involved in the fusion of tgn derived vesicles to generate cell plates and thus plays a crucial role in the initiation of cell plate formation . _PROTEIN_ was visualized by indirect _METHOD_ microscopy in root cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized to the growing cell plate but their spatiotemporal distributions were slightly different . at the early stage of cell plate formation both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ closely overlapped at the growing cell plate . the _PROTEIN_ specific _METHOD_ was always more enriched at the periphery of the cell plate than _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ until the cell plate had grown out to the parental _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ disappeared rapidly from the cell plate after it had connected with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ whereas _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ remained in the maturing cell plate . the differences in spatial localization patterns of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ in relation to the growing cell plate were more clearly visible in a three dimensional reconstruction of the cell plate . next the spatiotemporal localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was compared with that of _PROTEIN_ a dynamin related protein known to play a role in _LOCATION_ tubulation in the forming cell plate . it has been proposed that dynamin related proteins are involved in two different steps during cytokinesis formation of the cell plate and endocytosis from the cell plate . to localize _PROTEIN_ to the forming cell plate root tissues of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants were immunostained with an anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . _PROTEIN_ localized to the cell plate as observed previously with _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ . as was the case with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ differed slightly in their temporal and spatial localization patterns . in the forming cell plate _PROTEIN_ appeared earlier than _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ began to accumulate in the young cell plate at _PROTEIN_ anaphase when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was barely visible . soon after this stage the _METHOD_ intensity of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at the growing cell plate increased . at subsequent stages in the central region of the growing cell plate the _METHOD_ intensity of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ remained higher than that of _PROTEIN_ until the stage just before the cell plate reached the parental _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . at the end of cytokinesis when both ends of the growing cell plate reached the parental _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ the _METHOD_ intensity of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was similar to that of _PROTEIN_ and their _METHOD_ intensity in the central region was lower than that at both ends of the cell plate . overall _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ exhibited similar but not identical spatial distribution along the cell plate and their temporal distribution was also slightly different . these results suggest that the physiological role of _PROTEIN_ in the biogenesis of the cell plate differs from that of _PROTEIN_ . next the localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the cell plate was compared with that of clc . ccvs play a role in endocytosis from the cell plate . it has been shown that clc localizes to the cell plate during cytokinesis . to compare the distribution of _PROTEIN_ and clc in the cell plate transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and clc morange were examined at different time points by time lapse imaging . at the min time point when the cell plate was first detected by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ clc morange was not observed at the cell plate indicating that _PROTEIN_ arrives at the cell plate before clc . at and min their spatial localization patterns in relation to the cell plate overlap precisely . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ and clc work together in the cell plate for a certain period of the cell plate formation . the colocalization of _PROTEIN_ and clc in the growing cell plate suggested that _PROTEIN_ might be involved in ccv formation from the cell plate . to obtain additional evidence an in vitro protein pull down assay was performed to demonstrate an interaction between _PROTEIN_ and clathrin . recombinant _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in e. coli as a glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ fusion protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and was purified using the glutathione resin . purified _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was incubated with protein extracts from plant leaf tissues . proteins bound to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were precipitated and analyzed by immunoblot analysis using an anti clathrin h chain antibody . chc was detected in the precipitates indicating that _PROTEIN_ interacts with clathrin . as a negative control for the pull down assay the precipitates also were analyzed for _PROTEIN_ a subunit of a heterotetrameric _PROTEIN_ protein complex for ccvs . _PROTEIN_ was not detected in the precipitates confirming that the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and clathrin is specific . to map the potential clathrin binding site of _PROTEIN_ the n and c terminal domains of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ as _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins in e. coli . purified _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was incubated with protein extracts and proteins precipitated with these recombinant proteins were analyzed . chc was detected in the precipitates that were captured with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but not those captured with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ indicating that the c terminal domain of _PROTEIN_ contains the clathrin binding site . this also precludes the possibility that the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and clathrin is a nonspecific process .
