cation diffusion facilitator proteins belong to a family of heavy metal efflux transporters that might play an essential role in homeostasis and tolerance to metal ions . we investigated the subcellular localization of arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ a member of the cdf family and its physiological role in the tolerance to zn using _PROTEIN_ deficient mutant plants . _PROTEIN_ was immunochemically detected as a kda protein in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fractioned by sucrose density gradient centrifugation . the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ in suspension cultured cells was not affected by the zn concentration in the medium . when _PROTEIN_ fused with green _METHOD_ protein was transiently _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts prepared from arabidopsis suspension cultured cells green _METHOD_ was clearly observed in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . a t dna insertion mutant line for _PROTEIN_ displays enhanced sensitivity to high zn concentrations ranging from to but not to zn deficient conditions . mesophyll cells of the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants grown in the presence of zn were degraded suggesting that zn at high concentrations causes serious damage to leaves and that _PROTEIN_ plays a crucial role in preventing this damage in plants . thus we propose that _PROTEIN_ is localized in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and is involved in sequestration of excess zn in the cytoplasm into _LOCATION_ to _PROTEIN_ zn homeostasis .
to determine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ protein we prepared an anti peptide antibody against the n terminal hydrophilic region of _PROTEIN_ . the peptide sequence is characteristic of _PROTEIN_ compared with three other atmtps . the _LOCATION_ topology of _PROTEIN_ predicted by the hydropathy analysis is shown in fig . . _PROTEIN_ shares a common sequence gly phe ser asp with _PROTEIN_ . however the antibody against this peptide may not react with _PROTEIN_ because antibodies strictly recognize amino acid sequences with more than six residues . furthermore there was no identical peptide sequence in the total proteins of a. thaliana in the tair blast database . as shown in fig . a kda protein was detected in an immunoblot with the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . the protein band at kda was not detected when a corresponding antigen peptide was added to the reaction medium . although background levels were apparently different between lanes and the bands that appeared in lanes and did not appear in lanes and even when the background levels were much higher . a fusion protein of _PROTEIN_ with the epitope and tag which was _PROTEIN_ in yeast was also detected by both anti _PROTEIN_ and anti antibodies but not in yeast with the control vector . the crude _LOCATION_ fraction prepared from the homogenate of root cells of a. thaliana cultured in a murashige skoog _METHOD_ solution was subjected to equilibrium sucrose density gradient centrifugation . _PROTEIN_ protein was recovered in fractions together with the _LOCATION_ h _PROTEIN_ subunit a . vha a is _PROTEIN_ localized to _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ although a part of vha a protein was detected in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and other endomembranes . _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ h _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was recovered in fractions . bip an _LOCATION_ lumen marker protein was also detected in the same fractions as _PROTEIN_ under the free condition . in the presence of peak fractions of bip were moved to the high density fractions but the sedimentation of _PROTEIN_ was not altered . the activity of triton stimulated inosine diphosphatase a marker for the _LOCATION_ apparatus was detected in fractions which partially overlapped that of _PROTEIN_ . thus these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ apparatus in part but not to _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . it should be noted that the kda band of _PROTEIN_ was clearly detected in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ that was highly purified from a. thaliana suspension cultured cells . we also found a faint band with a smaller molecular size of kda in fractions . this band was different from the kda protein band detected in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fractions and the crude _LOCATION_ prepared from a. thaliana deep cells . the kda band was not detected clearly in the crude _LOCATION_ fractions from tissue homogenate and deep cells . thus a faint band of kda may be a non specific band . to determine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ we prepared a dna construct of a fusion protein of _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ it transiently in a. thaliana suspension cultured cells . as shown in fig . the green _METHOD_ from _METHOD_ was clearly detected on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ whereas _METHOD_ of free _METHOD_ was dispersed throughout the _LOCATION_ . it should be noted that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ which contained _METHOD_ at the n terminal end of _PROTEIN_ did not produce a clear _METHOD_ image . the n terminal region of _PROTEIN_ may be critical for correct folding and an additional _METHOD_ polypeptide might cause proteolytic degradation of the fusion protein . to examine whether the _PROTEIN_ protein level is altered by the zn concentration in the medium we immunochemically quantified _PROTEIN_ in suspension cultured cells under various zn concentrations . we used two types of a. thaliana suspension cultured cells deep and which were cells developed from roots and whole seedlings of a. thaliana columbia respectively . when cells were cultured for d in jpl medium which contained zn the _PROTEIN_ protein level was higher in deep cells rather than cells . both cells seem to retain the memory of their original tissues . for example cells but not deep cells synthesize chlorophyll in the _LOCATION_ and are green under the light . micro array _PROTEIN_ analysis _LOCATION_ and the _METHOD_ parallel signature sequencing database reported that the _PROTEIN_ mrna level in roots is twice of that in shoots and leaves of a. thaliana . therefore the abundance of _PROTEIN_ in deep cells may be a reflection of its original tissue . although the content was extremely low _PROTEIN_ was clearly detected in cells . the _PROTEIN_ level varied with the medium . the _PROTEIN_ level in deep cells cultured in _METHOD_ medium containing zn was three times greater than that of the cells in the jpl medium . then we examined the effect of the zn concentration in the culture medium on the _PROTEIN_ level . the level slightly increased with the concentration of zn but the change was similar to that of the v _PROTEIN_ subunit a . these results indicate that zn in the medium even at may not up regulate the transcription or translation of _PROTEIN_ in suspension cultured cells . we analyzed a t dna insertion mutant of a. thaliana . the insertion site of t dna was determined to be the terminal coding region of _PROTEIN_ by dna sequencing . the _PROTEIN_ mutant lacked an _PROTEIN_ transcription product although the wild type plant gave a band of bp . _PROTEIN_ protein was not detected in the crude _LOCATION_ fraction prepared from the mutant plant . the _PROTEIN_ mutants were morphologically normal when grown in vitro and in the greenhouse under standard conditions . the wild type and mutant plants were grown on _METHOD_ medium for weeks after germination then transferred to the hydroponic medium containing zn for d. fig . shows that the _PROTEIN_ homozygous mutant was highly sensitive to zn . however the heterozygote _PROTEIN_ grew normally under the same conditions . the tolerance of the mutant plants to high concentrations of zn was recovered when _PROTEIN_ was transformed with the _PROTEIN_ gene under the control of the promoter confirming that _PROTEIN_ is involved in the tolerance of a. thaliana to zn . the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants grew normally in the _METHOD_ medium like the wild type plants . the _METHOD_ medium contained zn . no difference in growth was observed between the _PROTEIN_ mutant and wild type seedlings when cultivated in the medium containing or zn . the mutant plants did not grow in the presence of high concentrations of zn . at and zn the root length of the mutant seedlings _PROTEIN_ to and respectively of that of the control seedlings grown in _METHOD_ medium . two week old plants germinated in _METHOD_ medium were transferred to a cultivation solution containing and for d . the _PROTEIN_ mutant plantlets grew normally in and zn however they showed severe chlorosis of leaves and suppression of leaf development in and zn . it should be noted that the medium may contain a trace amount of zn even in the zn culture medium since no special measures were taken to remove completely metal ions contaminating either purified water or other reagents . thus we could not draw any conclusions on the effect of complete zn deficiency on the growth of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . _PROTEIN_ has been determined to transport cd although at only of the zn transport rate . we examined the sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ mutants to other metals including cd by monitoring the root growth of germinating seedlings as shown in fig . . in the presence of co cd or ni the root length was of that under control conditions . however there was no difference between the wild type and the mutant plants . manganese did not affect the growth even at mm . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is highly specific to zn at least at high concentrations of the metal . the negative effect of these metal ions at higher concentrations remains to be examined . in addition to the low growth rate of _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings in high concentrations of zn we observed a change in cell morphology . figure shows the sections prepared from mutant plants grown in . plasmolysis tends to occur in cells of plants grown in the presence of high concentrations of zn . as the major changes in the _PROTEIN_ mutant plant a large part of the parenchyma tissues in leaves was broken down and most mesophyll cells disappeared while the breakdown of cells was not observed in the wild type plant . the damage in leaves was more severe than that in roots which did not have any collapsed cells . the collapse of cells may be a cause of etiolation of leaves in the mutant plants as observed in fig . and .
surface sterilized seeds of a. thaliana were germinated on sterile _METHOD_ salt plates containing mm mes koh ph sucrose for growing the roots with shaking in a rotary shaker . all plants were grown at under long day conditions . a. thaliana suspension cultured cells which originated from roots were a kind gift from dr. masaaki umeda of tokyo university and were cultured as described previously .

then injected into rabbits . the peptide specific antibodies against the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ h _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ bip and subunit a of _LOCATION_ h _PROTEIN_ were also prepared by the same procedure . proteins were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and transferred to an immobilon p _LOCATION_ . after blocking with de fatted milk the _LOCATION_ filter was incubated with primary antibody

isolation of the _PROTEIN_ cdna total rna was isolated from week old arabidopsis seedlings and converted to cdnas using ii rnase h reverse transcriptase and an oligo _PROTEIN_ primer . _PROTEIN_ cdnas were then directly amplified by polymerase chain reaction with a pair of primers caccatggagtcttcaagtcc and gcgctcgatttgtatcgtg . the cdna was inserted into a gateway entry vector pentr/d topo and then the _PROTEIN_ dna was introduced into yeast _PROTEIN_ vector by the gateway system . the plasmid was transferred into yeast strain _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by the lioac/peg method and grown in sc minimal medium . _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter in sc minimal galactose medium . crude _LOCATION_ were prepared from yeast cells cultured for h at as described previously . the _PROTEIN_ was detected by immunoblotting . fusion proteins with _METHOD_ were produced by inserting the pcr products of _PROTEIN_ into a newly prepared gateway vector new using the gateway

lines made by laboratoire de et des plantes institut national de la recherche agronomique versailles . a homozygous transgenic line was selected and the location of the t dna insertion in _PROTEIN_ was determined by pcr with an _PROTEIN_ specific and t dna specific in the left border primers . for the mutant complementation the _PROTEIN_ gene on the pentr _PROTEIN_ entry vector was cloned in binary vector with the promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus and introduced into agrobacterium tumefaciens strain and then used to transform _PROTEIN_ homozygous mutant plants by the floral dip method
