_LOCATION_ are large coiled coil proteins that play a role in tethering of vesicles to _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and in _PROTEIN_ the overall structure of the _LOCATION_ apparatus . six arabidopsis proteins with the structural characteristics of _LOCATION_ were isolated and shown to locate to _LOCATION_ stacks when fused to _METHOD_ . two of these _LOCATION_ candidates _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ possess c terminal transmembrane domains with similarity to the tm domain of human _LOCATION_ . the c termini of two others _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ contain conserved _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ domains that are also found in yeast and human . _PROTEIN_ shares similarity with yeast and human tmf and _PROTEIN_ with yeast and human . when fused to _METHOD_ the c terminal domains of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ localized to the _LOCATION_ showing that they contain _LOCATION_ localization motifs . the n termini on the other hand label the _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ . immuno gold labelling and co _PROTEIN_ with the cis _LOCATION_ q snare _PROTEIN_ resulted in a more detailed picture of the sub _LOCATION_ location of some of these putative _LOCATION_ . using two independent assays it is further demonstrated that the interaction between _PROTEIN_ the tmf homologue and the _PROTEIN_ homologues is conserved in plants .
cdnas of six large coiled coil proteins from arabidopsis were amplified from arabidopsis cell culture or leaf cdna and fused to the end of the _METHOD_ gene in binary vectors . the proteins had previously been noted to share sequence similarity with _LOCATION_ from mammals and yeast although the regions of significant similarity were _PROTEIN_ confined to specific domains . to save confusion the proteins were arbitrarily named _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ . one of them _PROTEIN_ has recently been named _PROTEIN_ by citation . the six _METHOD_ fusion proteins were _PROTEIN_ in tobacco epidermal cells using infiltration of a suspension of agrobacterium tumefaciens carrying the appropriate construct . the tobacco line stably _PROTEIN_ the signal anchor sequence of a rat sialyl transferase fused to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ as a _LOCATION_ marker . _METHOD_ fusions of the previously characterized putative arabidopsis _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were included for comparison . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fusions both co located with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ as was reported previously . _PROTEIN_ had previously been shown to co locate with another _LOCATION_ marker _LOCATION_ and thus its co localization with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ the _LOCATION_ localization of this protein . _PROTEIN_ and also labelled the same organelles as _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ suggesting that they too are _LOCATION_ proteins . at higher magnification _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were observed as green _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ around the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ bodies . when these fusion proteins were _PROTEIN_ at high levels _LOCATION_ stacks were sometimes observed to aggregate into large clusters . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ displayed similar _PROTEIN_ around the _LOCATION_ stacks but were also detected on structures that did not co locate with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in the case of _PROTEIN_ these non _LOCATION_ structures have been studied in more detail . they were shown to be identical to arf _METHOD_ labelled structures that can bud from the _LOCATION_ and that can also be stained by the stryryl dye suggesting that it concerns a post _LOCATION_ compartment . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ similarly appeared as _PROTEIN_ around _LOCATION_ stacks but a relatively high level of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was also detected in the cytoplasm . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ concentrated on one side of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labelled _LOCATION_ body . in the case of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ only a minority of cells showed _LOCATION_ labelling presumably reflecting the sensitivity of location to _PROTEIN_ levels . most cells accumulated the _METHOD_ fusion protein in large structures that appeared to be _LOCATION_ bounded frequently rounded and sometimes elongated in shape . it was not possible to assess the nature of these structures and it is speculated that they are either involved in degradation of a surplus of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein or are formed from aggregated _LOCATION_ . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were also _PROTEIN_ in wild type tobacco leaves in the presence of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and the co labelling patterns were the same as the ones described for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ located to _LOCATION_ stacks _PROTEIN_ of whether it was fused to the n terminus or the c terminus of _METHOD_ . by contrast when _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ were fused to the n terminus of _METHOD_ their labelling patterns were reminiscent of cytoplasmic labelling . in the case of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ large aggregates were also observed . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed the same combination of _LOCATION_ labelling in some cells and the previously described large structures in others . in addition _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was inserted between amino acid no . and of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the _METHOD_ fusion protein again resulted in the same labelling patterns as _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ . co _PROTEIN_ of this construct with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ also showed a similar distribution of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ on one side of the _PROTEIN_ labelled _LOCATION_ stacks . figure is a schematic representation of the domain structures of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ . arabidopsis large coiled coil domain proteins have been annotated in the arabicoil database . the positions and sizes of the predicted coiled coil domains in the _LOCATION_ were derived from this database and drawn to scale . the sequences of our _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cdna clones showed that the splicing patterns giving rise to the corresponding mature mrnas differed from those reported in the arabidopsis information resource database . in the case of _PROTEIN_ four splicing events differed between our sequence and the sequence in the database and in _PROTEIN_ only one was different . the programme paircoil was used to predict positions and sizes of the coiled coil domains in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ possesses a c terminal _PROTEIN_ domain sharing up to identity with _PROTEIN_ domains from four human _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ shows overall amino acid identity to human _PROTEIN_ and has a single c terminal tm domain . two tm prediction programmes das domain prediction and tmpred predicted that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ similarly possess single c terminal tm domains . these tm domain are and identical respectively to the tm domain of human _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have the same predicted _LOCATION_ topology as _LOCATION_ . the alignments of the full length proteins are presented in supplementary supplementary data at jxb online . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ share overall identity and similarity . short regions in the c termini of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are and identical respectively to the c terminal _PROTEIN_ domain of the human _LOCATION_ . downstream of the _PROTEIN_ domain in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ a second motif was detected called the _PROTEIN_ associated _PROTEIN_ motif . this motif is also conserved in the _PROTEIN_ domain proteins from other _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are identical at the protein level . the most c terminal predicted coiled coil domain of _PROTEIN_ shows sequence similarity to the c terminus of human tmf . this region is also conserved in the yeast _LOCATION_ and single proteins from neurospora crassa and drosophila melanogaster . finally the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ shows amino acid identity with human . the n terminus of is predicted to be a globular domain to an otherwise rod like structure . as is the case in both human and yeast this domain is followed by two regions of coiled coil in _PROTEIN_ . a region similar to the short c terminal acidic domain found in and can also be distinguished in _PROTEIN_ but it contains fewer acidic amino acids and is therefore less distinct . according to citation the predominant _LOCATION_ localization signal in human _LOCATION_ resides in the c terminal domain encompassing the tm domain and approximately amino acids preceding the tm domain . c terminal domains of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ comprising the tm domains and amino acids upstream were fused to the c terminus of _METHOD_ . the resulting fusion proteins _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ both co located with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in epidermal cells and labelled _PROTEIN_ shaped structures around _LOCATION_ bodies . their labelling patterns were indistinguishable from the corresponding _METHOD_ labelled full length proteins although at high _PROTEIN_ levels _METHOD_ accumulated on small structures of unidentified nature . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ n termini _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fused to the c terminus of _METHOD_ resulted in cytoplasmic labelling as well as labelling of the _LOCATION_ in the case of the _PROTEIN_ n terminus . the _PROTEIN_ domain containing c termini of yeast and human provide the _LOCATION_ localization signal for these proteins . to test if the localization signals in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ also reside in the c terminus fusion proteins with _METHOD_ were prepared of the c terminal and amino acids of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . the resulting fusion proteins were named _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and encompass the conserved _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ domains . the fusion proteins were _PROTEIN_ in tobacco epidermal cells and both labelled _PROTEIN_ like structures that co located with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . additional _METHOD_ structures were detected that did not co locate with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ similar to those observed with full length _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the n terminal domain of _PROTEIN_ showed cytoplasmic labelling whereas in the case of _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ was predominantly found in the _LOCATION_ . the c terminal amino acids of _PROTEIN_ containing the region of similarity with human tmf and yeast targeted _METHOD_ to _LOCATION_ stacks and to the cytoplasm again showing very similar _METHOD_ to the corresponding full length protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ was observed in the cytoplasm and around the _LOCATION_ with the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ . the c terminal amino acids of _PROTEIN_ encompass the region that corresponds to the region in human which binds and is responsible for _LOCATION_ targeting . this part of _PROTEIN_ was fused to the c terminus of _METHOD_ and the fusion protein showed the same distribution as full length _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ some cells with clear _LOCATION_ labelling and others with large irregularly shaped _METHOD_ _METHOD_ structures . to characterize further which regions of the _LOCATION_ stacks were labelled with the _METHOD_ tagged _LOCATION_ candidates the fusion proteins were co _PROTEIN_ with a fusion protein of the arabidopsis q snare _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ . the human and yeast homologues of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are cis _LOCATION_ snare proteins . it has been shown that overexpression of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in tobacco epidermal cells causes _LOCATION_ the arabidopsis homologue of the h/kdel receptor to redistribute to the _LOCATION_ . this effect was not found with other snare _METHOD_ fusion proteins . _PROTEIN_ is therefore most likely involved in processes related to transport at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ interface or cis _LOCATION_ . high magnification images of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in plants suggested that its location overlaps with but does not fully coincide with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . furthermore it has previously been shown that it locates to the opposite side of the stack to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ triple labelled cell . this led to the suggestion that _PROTEIN_ is a trans _LOCATION_ or tgn protein . when _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were co _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in tobacco epidermal cells triple labelled _LOCATION_ were detected in cells _PROTEIN_ low levels of each of the three _METHOD_ proteins . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was detected precisely in the centre of the _PROTEIN_ formed by _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . in the case of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ signals both located slightly to one side of the area labelled by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . this localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ relative to _PROTEIN_ clearly differs from that of _PROTEIN_ indicating that they locate to a different part of the _LOCATION_ to the _PROTEIN_ domain protein most likely the cis _LOCATION_ area . due to the fainter _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and the higher level of _METHOD_ in the cytoplasm its location relative to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was difficult to discern . to study the location of three of the eight putative arabidopsis _LOCATION_ in more detail tobacco leaves _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were high pressure frozen and labelled with an anti _METHOD_ antibody and a gold conjugated secondary antibody . in the case of _PROTEIN_ the gold label was predominantly found in trans _LOCATION_ cisternae and on vesicular or tubular structures adjoining the trans _LOCATION_ presumably the tgn . in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells gold label was _PROTEIN_ detected in the often bulbous margins of the cisternae . no gold label was found associated with _LOCATION_ stacks in control leaves . the c terminal domain of the yeast _LOCATION_ interacts with the yeast _PROTEIN_ homologue which recruits to _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . tmf the human homologue of binds the three human _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ but not . to investigate whether the interaction between tmf and _PROTEIN_ is conserved in arabidopsis the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ and the two arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ homologues and _PROTEIN_ were used in a yeast two hybrid assay . was fused to the binding domain and both _PROTEIN_ homologues were fused to the activation domain _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the test showed a clear interaction between and both and _PROTEIN_ . by contrast gbd did not interact with the homologue _PROTEIN_ nor did the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interact with any of the three _PROTEIN_ rab proteins . next and _PROTEIN_ were fused to glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ and to a six histidine tag . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were immobilized on glutathione agarose and incubated with an escherichia coli lysate of a strain producing . the interacting proteins were eluted separated on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and detected using an anti antibody on western blot . showed a strong interaction with both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the interactions were equally efficient in the presence of gdp and _PROTEIN_ . no binding was detected between and _PROTEIN_ fusions of the two homologues _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . again a tagged version of _PROTEIN_ failed to interact with any of the four _PROTEIN_ tagged rab proteins .

substitution was carried out in a reichert afs freeze substitution system . sample holders were split open under liquid nitrogen and placed into plastic porous specimen pots containing the
