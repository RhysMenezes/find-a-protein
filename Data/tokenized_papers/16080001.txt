recently close relatives of class b floral homeotic genes termed bsister genes have been identified in both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . in contrast to the b genes _METHOD_ bsister genes are exclusively _PROTEIN_ in female reproductive organs especially in the envelopes or integuments surrounding the ovules . this suggests an important ancient function in ovule or seed development for bsister genes which has been conserved for about million years . however investigation of the first loss of function mutant for a bsister gene _PROTEIN_ revealed only a weak phenotype affecting endothelium formation . here we present an analysis of two additional mutant alleles which corroborates this weak phenotype . transgenic plants that ectopically _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ show changes in the growth and identity of floral organs suggesting that _PROTEIN_ can interact with floral homeotic proteins . yeast two hybrid and three hybrid analyses indicated that _PROTEIN_ can form dimers with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ floral homeotic proteins and multimeric complexes that also include the _PROTEIN_ like proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . these data suggest that the formation of multimeric transcription _PROTEIN_ complexes might be a general phenomenon among mikc type mads domain proteins in _METHOD_ . heterodimerization of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ was confirmed by gel retardation assays . fusion proteins tagged with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in arabidopsis protoplasts showed that _PROTEIN_ is localized in the _LOCATION_ . phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of a structurally deviant but closely related paralogue of _PROTEIN_ in the arabidopsis genome . thus the evolutionary developmental genetics of bsister genes can probably only be understood as part of a complex and redundant gene network that may govern ovule formation in a conserved manner which has yet to be fully explored .
arabidopsis abs mutants show structural defects in endothelium cell layer of the ovule in which _PROTEIN_ are specifically are affected in _PROTEIN_ accumulation . to investigate whether the mutant alleles of _PROTEIN_ reported previously display the null mutant phenotype novel knock out alleles were identified by reverse genetics . screening of the _PROTEIN_ population of transposon insertion lines identified two lines and which were analysed further . line harbours a transposon insertion in the third intron of the _PROTEIN_ locus . the transposon shows a large internal deletion and has a total length of only about kb . line carries an insertion in the several bases downstream of the stop codon . in accordance with the nomenclature used by nesi et al . we have termed the novel mutant alleles _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the seeds of plants from both lines showed an unstable transparent testa phenotype displaying a range of colours from a wild type like brown to yellowish with a dark brown micropylar and _PROTEIN_ end . for two representative plants of each line the accumulation of precursors of _PROTEIN_ was tested by vanillin staining . irregular patterns of staining similar to those observed in mature seeds were obtained and residual background production of _PROTEIN_ in line was observed after prolonged staining . in addition seed anatomy was analysed by toluidine staining of sections of immature seeds . sequencing of pcr amplified alleles revealed multiple somatic excision events indicating that the mosaic like phenotype might be due to the genetic instability of the insertion of the en transposable element at the _PROTEIN_ locus . due to the formation of revertant sectors by somatic excision of the en element a straightforward distinction between true heterozygotes and homozygotes was not possible . aside from its genetic instability the mutant phenotype of the two novel insertion alleles _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ almost perfectly matches that of previously described putative null alleles . these results suggest that the observed phenotype is very probably caused by the mutation in the _PROTEIN_ locus although southern analyses revealed the presence of approximately copies of the en transposon in both lines . moreover the mutant phenotypes of the novel alleles strongly corroborate the view that the changes in seed colour and endothelial cell structure represent the null phenotype of _PROTEIN_ . we therefore chose not to investigate these lines further . to gain further insight into the function of _PROTEIN_ the analysis of loss of function mutants was complemented by a detailed investigation of transgenic gain of function lines in which the _PROTEIN_ coding region was _PROTEIN_ under the control of the camv promoter . the _PROTEIN_ and penetrance of the phenotypes in the generation varied . a survey of the generation of basta resistant lines showed that in this case of lines showed a phenotype in the generation . the weaker phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ plants resembled those previously described by nesi et al . . we also observed stronger phenotypes which have not been described previously . these are characterized by a strong curling of the leaves infertility and floral homeotic changes . plants with a strong phenotype were usually smaller than wild type plants . in contrast to wild type flowers were open during all developmental stages starting from bud initiation . moreover the developmental timing of relative organ growth was disturbed leading to enhanced growth of carpels relative to other organs . frequently some of the inflorescence _METHOD_ of the plants terminated in a compound structure consisting of carpeloid and stamenoid organs and bracts having mosaic structures made up of carpeloid or stamenoid elements and vegetative parts . the infertility may have been caused partly by defects in stamen elongation at the stage of anthesis and partly by a _PROTEIN_ in the production of mature pollen . flowers displaying strong phenotypes were further examined by scanning electron microscopy . sepal cell structure was particularly strongly affected in these plants . the outer sepal surface of mature wild type flowers consists of a mixture of long and short irregularly shaped epidermal cells which become distinguishable from other cell types at stage of flower development . in contrast the cell pattern of _PROTEIN_ sepals is regular and more like the carpel type . the carpeloid nature of sepal organs in _PROTEIN_ plants is further supported by the occasional presence of stigmatic tissue on the margins . ovules were rarely formed on sepals . stigmatic tissue was also sometimes observed on the margins of some bracts in _PROTEIN_ appearing parts of the inflorescence . phenotypic analysis of _PROTEIN_ mik transgenic plants which were transformed with constructs in which the region encoding the c terminal domain of _PROTEIN_ was deleted showed similar phenotypes . _PROTEIN_ mik plants displayed a curly leaf phenotype with early opening flowers and in some cases partial homeotic transformations or terminal compound floral structures were observed _PROTEIN_ . to investigate the sterility defects further we analysed ovule development by staining ovule whole mounts from several siliques of two sterile plants of _PROTEIN_ plants . the nucellus was present in most ovules but the embryo sac was often aborted at a very early stage of development . the incidence of this phenotype was higher in _PROTEIN_ appearing flowers than in those that opened early . the integument structure appeared irregular in some cases . fertility was tested by applying wild type pollen to siliques . less than half of the tested ovules developed into seeds . in the embryos that developed maturation was often delayed and reduced amounts of endosperm were formed . _PROTEIN_ analysis using rt pcr showed a strong _PROTEIN_ signal in the vegetative organs of transgenic _PROTEIN_ plants while no _PROTEIN_ was detected in rosette leaves of wild type arabidopsis plants . we then analysed the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ plants . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are mads box genes which have previously been shown to be required for ovule development and produce comparable homeotic conversions of sepals into carpelloid organs when ectopically _PROTEIN_ . however overexpression of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ can additionally induce homeotic transformation of _PROTEIN_ to stamens similar to _PROTEIN_ . we also investigated the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ a closely related paralogue of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ did not show any significant increase in _PROTEIN_ in rosette leaves of _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants . a slight increase in _PROTEIN_ level was observed in some lines for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but the effects of this weak _PROTEIN_ in transgenic rosette leaves remain to be determined . it is likely that ectopic activation of these genes is more pronounced in the flower or inflorescence background as has been observed in other transgenic plants that constitutively _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ like genes and develop a phenotype that is similar to that of _PROTEIN_ plants . in summary ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ can affect the growth and identity of floral organs possibly by direct interaction with other floral homeotic genes or by ectopic activation of target genes . a number of previous studies revealed that mads domain proteins form dimers or higher order complexes to carry out their functions in flower and ovule development . the k domain has been shown to function in protein interaction together with the mads and i domains . the k domain is characterized by three strings of heptad repeats with hydrophobic amino acids predominating in the a and d positions . they probably constitute interaction surfaces involved in the formation of coiled coils . the heptad repeats are named and . here we generally defined the k domain as including a sequence that has traditionally been assigned to the c domain but is predicted to be part of the helix . in order to search for dimerization partners of _PROTEIN_ a yeast two hybrid assay was performed by screening an arabidopsis cdna library with the complete _PROTEIN_ coding region as the bait . among the clones obtained were identified as _PROTEIN_ four as _PROTEIN_ three as _PROTEIN_ and one as _PROTEIN_ all these genes code for _PROTEIN_ like mads domain proteins . among the clones that gave weaker interaction signals _PROTEIN_ was found four times . as indicated in fig . the majority of _PROTEIN_ clones that were identified were full length or were missing only codons at their ends and had minor deletions of terminal sequences . four of the _PROTEIN_ products started at amino acid position in the i domain and one was among the strongest a protein consisting of domains to c . one of the clones had a deletion in the second half of probably caused by a splicing defect that eliminated exon . the structures of all the identified _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ segments produced by interacting clones are given in fig . . the identified protein interactions were usually verified using full length clones . for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the bait vector only clones that had c terminal deletions were used in order to avoid autoactivation . it was found that all tested interactions except the one between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ worked in both directions . the inability of the full length _PROTEIN_ protein fused to the activation domain to interact with _PROTEIN_ is consistent with the _PROTEIN_ that only n terminally deleted versions were found in the screen suggesting a possible inhibitory effect of the mads domain on the interaction . this was only observed in one direction however . similar phenomena have been seen in other yeast two hybrid experiments with _PROTEIN_ . furthermore very weak homodimerization of _PROTEIN_ was observed in a test for homomeric interaction . for the protein protein interaction most frequently observed in the yeast two hybrid _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ approximate minimal interaction domain of _PROTEIN_ was determined . for that purpose several deletion constructs were cloned into the two hybrid vectors . fusion proteins comprising the binding domain linked to _PROTEIN_ sequences lacking the mads domain showed autoactivation in yeast as revealed by growth on plates lacking histidine and supplemented with mm _PROTEIN_ . clear evidence for autoactivation was found with clones containing the c terminal domain . this may be related to the presence of glutamine rich stretches in the highly divergent c terminal part of _PROTEIN_ . autoactivation was abolished when the c terminal domain was deleted as shown for a construct comprising the complete k domain . in light of these findings the interaction of domain deletion versions of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ was only tested in one direction using _PROTEIN_ sequences fused to the activation domain . the distribution of clones identified in this screen suggested the k domain as the minimal interaction domain of _PROTEIN_ required for interaction with _PROTEIN_ . for that reason we used a _PROTEIN_ construct encoding the i and k domains fused to the binding domain . in the interaction tests we identified the distal part of the k domain to be the minimal domain of _PROTEIN_ necessary for interaction with _PROTEIN_ . recently favaro et al . demonstrated the formation of higher order complexes of mads domain proteins involved in ovule and carpel development . these protein complexes basically consist of combinations of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and of the class e protein _PROTEIN_ . as members of the _PROTEIN_ clade have been shown to be _PROTEIN_ in ovules we looked for evidence of a molecular interaction between _PROTEIN_ and members of the _PROTEIN_ clade in ternary complexes containing _PROTEIN_ since no dimerization between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ occurs in yeast two hybrid experiments . the full length coding region of _PROTEIN_ was cloned into the ternary vector . we screened at and because previous studies have shown that higher order interactions of arabidopsis mikc type proteins are more stable at lower temperatures . we identified a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction at both and . at we also identified a putative complex consisting of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . furthermore interaction of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was detected at but not at indicating that the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ is not essential for the formation of higher order complexes at but enhances the interaction or stability of the complex at higher temperatures . previous analyses and structural data have shown that mads domain proteins bind to specific dna sequences as dimers . however not all protein complexes that have been identified in yeast two hybrid or co immunoprecipitation experiments have been shown to be capable of dna binding . to learn more about the nature of the interactions between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins we tested whether the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ dimer is able to bind specifically to carg box dna . this experiment also served as an independent control of the results obtained in the yeast two hybrid system . first we analysed the dna binding capacity of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ separately . like most mikc type proteins analysed so far both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ could bind to the dna probes as homodimers . however _PROTEIN_ bound less strongly to the carg box than _PROTEIN_ . binding of labelled probe by _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ could be abolished almost completely by adding a fold excess of unlabelled carg box containing dna but not carg box free dna to the reaction thus revealing the specificity of these proteins for the carg box . in contrast the _PROTEIN_ mik protein in which the c terminus of the protein was deleted was very seriously impaired in binding to dna on its own owing to defects in dna binding or dimerization . dna binding was not completely abolished however . when an excess of _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in the presence of _PROTEIN_ mik and carg box dna two retarded bands were detected the upper band corresponded to the _PROTEIN_ homodimer and the lower to the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ heterodimer . thus the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ heterodimer detected in yeast two hybrid experiments is able to bind to dna . the carg box used in our experiments the sequence of which matches the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ dna recognition consensus sequences almost perfectly appeared to bind more strongly to the heterodimer than to the _PROTEIN_ homodimer . binding to the mutcarg box which has a single > g substitution in the a/t core of the carg sequence was weaker but still detectable . that mads domain proteins can bind to carg boxes whose sequences deviate slightly from the consensus has been shown previously . addition of unlabelled carg box dna significantly reduced the amount of labelled dna that was shifted while the addition of unlabelled carg box free dna did not lead to a reduction in the level of shifted probe demonstrating that the _PROTEIN_ heterodimer binds specifically to the carg box . mikc type mads domain proteins are assumed to function in transcriptional regulation in the _LOCATION_ . we therefore tested whether _PROTEIN_ is indeed localized in the _LOCATION_ . fusion proteins comprising _PROTEIN_ linked to the yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ or the cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ were _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts under the control of the promoter of the cauliflower mosaic virus . investigation of the intracellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins by confocal laser scanning microscopy _PROTEIN_ revealed that both types of fusion proteins are located almost exclusively in the _LOCATION_ while _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ alone led only to diffuse _METHOD_ in the cell . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins were also clearly localized in the _LOCATION_ . these data demonstrate that all these proteins can enter the _LOCATION_ alone or together with _PROTEIN_ that are present in the protoplasts used . in order to gain more insight into the evolutionary conservation of bsister genes phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analysis were performed . an initial database screen for bsister genes from other taxa was followed by phylogeny reconstructions . these analyses revealed the presence of two paralogous gene clades in the grass family called the clade sensu stricto and the clade . representatives of both clades were found in rice barley and maize . in rice a third paralogue is present which _METHOD_ to be more closely related to the clade than to the others . furthermore _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis was identified as the most closely related paralogue of _PROTEIN_ in the arabidopsis genome in agreement with earlier indications . _PROTEIN_ is an unusual gene however because it is characterized by a much faster rate of sequence evolution than _PROTEIN_ and by some deletions in the coding sequence . in their large scale analysis of all arabidopsis mads box genes parenicova et al . have shown that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in inflorescences and siliques and also in roots . we confirmed the _PROTEIN_ in flowers which was very weak and could detect no _PROTEIN_ in vegetative leaves .
