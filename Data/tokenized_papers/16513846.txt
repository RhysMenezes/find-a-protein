the gene shoot meristemless _PROTEIN_ is required for the initiation and the _PROTEIN_ of the shoot apical meristem in arabidopsis and encodes a meinox/three amino acid loop extension hd type transcription _PROTEIN_ . translational fusions with the green _METHOD_ protein showed that _PROTEIN_ is not _LOCATION_ by default . in a yeast two hybrid screen performed with a meristem enriched cdna library three interacting blh _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ were identified . according to bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation _PROTEIN_ is targeted into the _LOCATION_ compartment through heterodimerization with blh partner proteins which are _PROTEIN_ in distinct sam domains from the center to the periphery . on a functional level overexpression experiments in transgenic arabidopsis plants suggest that individual heterodimers provide distinct contributions . these results contribute to our understanding of the _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ function in the sam and also shed new light on the evolution of the tale hd super gene family in animal and plant lineages .
the method of choice to prove a physical interaction between candidate partner proteins in plant cells is bifc . as a prerequisite to substantiate interactions between potential partner proteins identified in a yeast two hybrid screen c and n terminal fusions between the orfs of _PROTEIN_ and the _METHOD_ were constructed and _PROTEIN_ in leek or onion epidermal cells after particle bombardment . as a potential transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was expected to direct _METHOD_ _METHOD_ into the plant cell _LOCATION_ . however both fusion proteins _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ remained in the cytoplasm . the same result was obtained in epidermal cells of the arabidopsis hypocotyl . in contrast the addition of the nls in front of the chimeric _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ orf efficiently directed the chimeric nls _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein into the plant cell _LOCATION_ . an inappropriate folding of the n or c terminal _METHOD_ fusion proteins is unlikely because _PROTEIN_ of both chimeric proteins _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in transgenic arabidopsis plants behind the promoter yielded the characteristic _PROTEIN_ overexpression phenotype . however in contrast to ectopic _PROTEIN_ activity affecting the sam or causing _METHOD_ on leaves the _PROTEIN_ of a _LOCATION_ targeted nls _PROTEIN_ version from the camv promoter in transgenic arabidopsis plant predominantly resulted in a lobed leaf phenotype which is reminiscent of _PROTEIN_ overexpression rather than _PROTEIN_ over _PROTEIN_ . lobed leaves were detected in from primary transformants whereas only plants showed meristem defects including stm phenocopies presumably due to co suppression . a _LOCATION_ targeted _PROTEIN_ protein version therefore affects leaf development more than sam function . the cytoplasmic retention of the chimeric _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein was further substantiated by confocal laser microscopy scanning and staining of _LOCATION_ with propidium iodide . the comparison of a median z stack projection through the _LOCATION_ either analysed for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the corresponding propidium iodine stains and their overlay in confirm exclusion of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ from the _LOCATION_ compartment . in contrast to the median sections depicted in the same scanning series shows _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ surrounding the _LOCATION_ which would explain _METHOD_ at the position of the _LOCATION_ in whole mounts depicted in . protein extracts prepard from leek epidermal cells after particle bombardement showed no degradation of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein with an antibody directed against the _METHOD_ . taken together the data lead to the conclusion that _PROTEIN_ is devoid of an efficient nls . additional support for _LOCATION_ exclusion was obtained by several _PROTEIN_ deletion constructs none of which targeted _METHOD_ _METHOD_ to the plant cell _LOCATION_ . this _LOCATION_ import deficiency is noteworthy since the elk domain conserved between the meinox domain and the homeodomain in plant _PROTEIN_ proteins has been assumed to provide a functional nls . potential _PROTEIN_ protein interaction partners were identified in a yeast two hybrid screen performed with a meristem enriched cdna library established in the vector and the meinoxstm domain as a bait _PROTEIN_ from the vector . in total positive clones were identified and all were annotated as orfs in the arabidopsis genome . besides known false positives proteins of unknown function or metabolic enzymes a major class was _LOCATION_ associated proteins including transporters or ion channels however any significance of this finding remains to be established . amongst cdnas encoding genes related to transcriptional control blh proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are subject to a detailed analysis here . although _PROTEIN_ has been implicated to interact with _PROTEIN_ it was included in the in depth analysis described here for comparison concerning a function in the sam . besides obvious controls in yeast such as retransformation of bait or prey plasmids and the combination with the empty bait vector we included the domain of the _PROTEIN_ gene as bait as it encodes the closest relative to the meinoxstm domain in the arabidopsis genome . all three blh proteins interact with both the meinoxstm and the domain and thus recognize sequence or structural features common to the meinox domains of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . in addition to the interactions in yeast we performed co immunoprecipitation experiments with epitope tagged full length proteins . the ha tagged blh proteins shown in were used to co precipitate epitope tagged _PROTEIN_ his . the detection of the _PROTEIN_ his protein was strictly dependent on the presence of blh partner proteins . the co immunoprecipitation experiments therefore confirm that the full length _PROTEIN_ protein interacts with full length _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins in vitro and substantiate the affinity of blh/stm interactions . a further step towards proof of biological relevance was the confirmation of a spatial overlap between the _PROTEIN_ domain of _PROTEIN_ and those of candidate partner blh genes by performing rna in situ hybridizations . all three blh genes are transcribed in the early arabidopsis seedling whereas the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ patterns have been analysed previously . rt pcr experiments readily detected _PROTEIN_ transcripts at the leaf seedling stage . combined in are the cellular transcription patterns in immature inflorescences where the indeterminate inflorescence meristem _PROTEIN_ and determinate _METHOD_ can be compared . all three blh genes are transcribed in _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . high levels of _PROTEIN_ transcripts are generally detected in the center of the _PROTEIN_ or fm and an additional stripe of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is found in the fm which is adjacent to a _PROTEIN_ organ primordium . in contrast _PROTEIN_ is transcribed in a cup shaped _PROTEIN_ domain enclosing the _PROTEIN_ domain whereas _PROTEIN_ transcripts are absent in the centre of the _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ transcription pattern has been analysed on the cellular level previously a section is included in to show its preference at the sam periphery . the in situ hybridizations with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ probes therefore suggest a zonation of the _PROTEIN_ from the center to the periphery . in contrast _PROTEIN_ is ubiquitously transcribed throughout the sam and only down regulated when cells acquire primordial fate at the sam periphery . the principle of bifc is the formation of a _METHOD_ complex by fragments of the enhanced _METHOD_ brought together by the association of two interaction partners . to verify _PROTEIN_ interaction partners we constructed translational fusions between the n or the c terminal _METHOD_ sub domains and the full length _PROTEIN_ protein or individual full length blh partner proteins . optimal combinations of chimeric gene constructs are indicated in above each corresponding experiment . chimeric genes were co delivered into leek epidermal cells by bombardment of tungsten particles double loaded with two appropriate chimeric gene constructs . any detectable _METHOD_ was dependent on the combination of the c terminal with the n terminal _METHOD_ sub domain fused to _PROTEIN_ or blh partner proteins . in contrast the fusion of the c or the n terminal _METHOD_ sub domain to the _PROTEIN_ protein and their co bombardment in plant cells gave no _METHOD_ . bifc therefore provided no evidence for the formation of _PROTEIN_ homodimers but substantiated the formation of _PROTEIN_ heterodimers . as shown in co _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ resulted in reconstitution of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . in contrast to results obtained with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions however the bifc signal exhibited a high preference for the _LOCATION_ whereas _METHOD_ was low in the cytoplasm . the bifc results therefore confirm that full length _PROTEIN_ and blh proteins interact in plant cells but more notably that blh/stm heterodimers are efficiently incorporated into the _LOCATION_ compartment . expectedly the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins exerted a preference for the _LOCATION_ compartment . the _LOCATION_ import of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in leek epidermal cells appears to be in contrast to previous results obtained in tobacco leaves after agroinfection with a c terminal _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion construct . however without analysing the cellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein bhatt et al . arrive at the same conclusion that _PROTEIN_ heterodimers are efficiently imported into the plant cell _LOCATION_ . in contrast to bombardments with the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ constructs the number of bifc positive cells obtained with the _PROTEIN_ combination _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was generally low . this may indicate a weak interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as suggested by the yeast two hybrid results that chimeric _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein levels remain low in leak epidermal cells or that steric constraints interfere with a reconstitution of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . reminiscent however of the meis/pbc situation in animals the _METHOD_ and bifc data show that the tale hd transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is targeted into the _LOCATION_ compartment through interaction with three blh partner proteins which are members of the non meinox class of tale hd proteins in plants . the bell domain is essential for the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with blh partner proteins . bifc experiments with _PROTEIN_ deletion polypeptides _PROTEIN_ demonstrated that amino acid sequences upstream and downstream of the bell domain including the homeodomain are dispensable for heterodimerization with _PROTEIN_ . bifc _METHOD_ still exerted a preference for the _LOCATION_ if sequences c terminal to the bell domain including the dna binding homeodomain were deleted _PROTEIN_ . in contrast _METHOD_ _METHOD_ reconstituted with the isolated bell domain remained _PROTEIN_ cytoplasmic . an effective nls therefore must be located in the _PROTEIN_ protein n terminal to its bell domain . in the _PROTEIN_ protein the meinoxstm domain is sufficient to interact with full length _PROTEIN_ . however we have been unable to reconstitute _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in bifc experiments with the isolated meinoxstm and domains although several compatible n or c terminal combinations with each _METHOD_ sub domain were tested . one explanation for this may be that the relative arrangement of _METHOD_ sub domains sterically interferes with their functional association . this assumption is supported by the _PROTEIN_ that the meinoxstm domain is precipitated via the domain in co immunoprecipitation experiments . we attempted to substantiate the functional relevance of _PROTEIN_ heterodimers in arabidopsis by combining an inducible _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ effector line with lines constitutively overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . for this purpose we first raised and analysed transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ individual blh genes behind the camv promoter . the most evident phenotype in primary transformants was observed with ectopic _PROTEIN_ gene activity which affected the elongation of internodes in inflorescence shoots . the severest phenotype essentially an absence of internode elongation was observed in from total of _PROTEIN_ resistent progeny . normal and fertile flowers emerged in an appropriate _PROTEIN_ from a stunted compact inflorescence a phenotype inherited up to the generation . some reduction in inflorescence height was also observed in _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants however this phenotype was not heritable in subsequent generations . in addition _PROTEIN_ overexpression caused alterations in _PROTEIN_ and phenotypes reminiscent of those described for loss of function alleles e.g . multiple cauline leaves subtending second order inflorescence shoots multiple axillary shoots emerging from a single inflorescence node or irregular elongation of internodes . in contrast _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants appeared similar to wild type although independent lines in the generation were early flowering compared with wild type plants . for each blh candidate partner protein gene two representative overexpressing lines were crossed into the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ background . to discriminate single from double transgenic plants progeny of these lines were subjected to a detailed phenotypic analysis . overexpression of either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ caused early flowering compared with columbia wild type controls whereas _PROTEIN_ transgenic progeny flowered much _PROTEIN_ . with p values ranging from _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ in the student 's t test these differences in flowering time are highly significant . in _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants early flowering is reflected by a reduced leaf number compared with columbia control plants . in contrast _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants flowered at the same time as _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants but developed more rosette leaves . overexpressing plants flowered three days earlier than wild type controls and produced on average one more leaf than wild type . the plastochron was estimated to be for wild type whereas _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants developed a new leaf approximately every day . this difference was confirmed in a third _PROTEIN_ transgenic line and is highly significant . in contrast no significant deviation in the plastochron was observed in _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants compared with the wild type . however transgenic _PROTEIN_ plants flowered on average days _PROTEIN_ than wild type columbia control plants and developed on average three more leaves than the wild type . the overexpression of three blh genes which are potential interaction partners of _PROTEIN_ in the sam therefore consistently affected flowering time either by altering the number of vegetative leaves _PROTEIN_ or the plastochron _PROTEIN_ . seeds obtained from crosses between _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines were sown on soil and monitored for transmission of the potential _PROTEIN_ partner protein transgene by selection for _PROTEIN_ resistance . the surviving seedlings of the individual crosses and lines were subdivided into three groups and either sprayed with dexamethasone at the or leaf stage or third group serving as an untreated control . since the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ effector transgene is propagated heterozygously only of the progeny can respond to the hormone treatment by releasing the chimeric _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein from cytoplasmic retention . when induced at the early leaf stage _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ control plants remained in the vegetative phase with newly initiated leaflets which were small and remained closely associated with the sam . in contrast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double transgene combinations ceased producing leaf primordia and instead initiated _METHOD_ . young leaflets already initiated at the time of dex application expanded but lacked petioles and in consequence remained in close association to the sam . the release of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ from cytoplasmic retention in two independent lines providing either ectopic _PROTEIN_ or ectopic _PROTEIN_ activity therefore _METHOD_ meristem identity from vegetative to reproductive . a different response to dex application was observed in the combination _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ these plants remained in the vegetative phase but initiated new leaves which were severely lobed . plants sprayed _PROTEIN_ at the or leaf stage also responded to dex application . however some _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ control plants started flowering shortly thereafter as did each double transgene combination . floral induction at this _PROTEIN_ stage therefore may be biased by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ overexpression . noteworthy is that cauline leaves in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants remained severely lobed thus confirming specificity of this additive leaf phenotype . characteristic for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ flowers are abnormalities such as a size reduction in outer whorl organs and a prominent carpel surrounded by few stamens . these features are shared by flowers emerging from early or _PROTEIN_ dex induced double transgene combinations . although this phenotype provides evidence for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the co activity of both transgenes was confirmed by rna gel blot experiments with pooled explant material for each transgene combination . no additional phenotype was observed in the no dex control group single transgene _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants or untreated double transgene combinations . in conclusion these additive combinatorial transgene results provide strong evidence that the overexpression of three blh partner proteins in transgenic arabidopsis plants creates novel functional competencies which are realized after _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is released from the _PROTEIN_ chaperonin . two discrete phenotypes floral induction and leaf lobing indicate response specificity and more importantly imply that individual blh proteins may contribute different functions through their interaction with _PROTEIN_ .
