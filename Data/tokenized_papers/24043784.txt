both mitochondria and chloroplasts contain distinct proteolytic _METHOD_ for precursor protein processing catalyzed by the mitochondrial and stromal processing peptidases and for the degradation of targeting peptides catalyzed by presequence protease . here we have identified and characterized a component of the organellar proteolytic _METHOD_ in arabidopsis thaliana the organellar oligopeptidase oop . oop belongs to the family of peptide degrading metalloproteases . using two independent in vivo methods we show that the protease is dually localized to mitochondria and chloroplasts . furthermore we localized the opp homolog _GENE_ to the _LOCATION_ . analysis of peptide degradation by oop revealed substrate size restriction from to aa residues . short mitochondrial targeting peptides _PROTEIN_ and n and c terminal fragments derived from the presequence of the _PROTEIN_ beta subunit ranging in size from to aa could be degraded . _METHOD_ analysis showed that oop does not exhibit a strict cleavage pattern but shows a weak preference for hydrophobic residues at the position . the crystal structures of oop at exhibit an ellipsoidal shape consisting of two major domains enclosing the catalytic cavity of . the structural and biochemical data suggest that the protein undergoes conformational changes to allow peptide binding and proteolysis . our results demonstrate the complementary role of oop in targeting peptide degradation in mitochondria and chloroplasts .
the subfamily of metallopeptidases is widespread in prokaryotes and eukaryotes and includes the human neurolysin the e. coli opda and the yeast _PROTEIN_ . this subfamily contains peptidases with two different functions . one group consists of oligopeptidases responsible for peptide degradation _PROTEIN_ . the second group includes processing peptidases specialized in the removal of octapeptides from the n termini of _PROTEIN_ processed precursor proteins . a survey of the arabidopsis genome shows that it contains four genes encoding putative proteases of the subfamily . none of these proteins has been characterized experimentally but all possess a peptidase domain carrying the zinc binding motif hexxh . to select putative organellar peptidases involved in peptide degradation we analyzed their similarity to the currently known degrading peptidases and their possible intracellular localization . based on these features we selected two of the four a. thaliana peptidases _GENE_ and _GENE_ because both cluster with the degrading peptidases on the phylogenetic tree . both were identified in chloroplasts using a high throughput proteomic approach although only _GENE_ is predicted to possess a transit peptide directing it to chloroplasts . we excluded two other a. thaliana peptidases from this study . peptidase _GENE_ clusters along with orthologs identified in yeast and mammals and is likely to be involved in processing not in peptide degradation whereas peptidase _GENE_ does not show a discernible mitochondrial or chloroplastic targeting sequence . we investigated the subcellular localization of _GENE_ and _GENE_ using two independent in vivo approaches transient _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis cell suspensions and immunodetection . detection in arabidopsis suspension cells showed dual localization in mitochondria and chloroplasts for _METHOD_ fused with full length _GENE_ and a _LOCATION_ localization for _METHOD_ fused with full length _GENE_ . because of the high sequence identity between _GENE_ and _GENE_ and thus the difficulty of producing specific antibodies we generated a. thaliana lines _PROTEIN_ c terminal _PROTEIN_ tagged full length variants of _GENE_ and _GENE_ . detection of the _PROTEIN_ tag in mitochondria chloroplasts and _LOCATION_ isolated from plants _PROTEIN_ tagged _GENE_ and _GENE_ respectively confirmed the dual localization of _GENE_ in mitochondria and chloroplasts and the _LOCATION_ localization of _GENE_ . based on these results we termed _GENE_ the organellar oligopeptidase and _GENE_ the _LOCATION_ oligopeptidase . further subfractionation of mitochondria and chloroplasts showed that oop is a soluble protein localized in the _PROTEIN_ and stroma respectively having the same intracellular localization as the dual localized presequence protease atprep . according to targetp the precursor of oop contains a transit peptide of aa that is putatively cleaved off after import . to verify this result we compared the in gel mobility of the oop precursor with that of an oop variant lacking first amino acids overexpressed in bacteria and the native mature oop _METHOD_ in mitochondria and chloroplasts . the mature oop _METHOD_ detected in the isolated organelles migrate at a level similar to that of the overexpressed variant and at a lower level than the precursor form confirming that the precursor of oop undergoes processing . previous reports suggested that peptidases may be involved in the degradation of targeting peptides and even may cooperate with peptidases in this function . we approached this idea by testing the activity of the mitochondria and chloroplast resident oop against the nicotiana plumbaginifolia a well characterized substrate of atprep . for activity assays we used the recombinant variant produced in bacteria . full length is not degraded by oop but it was degraded completely by the control _PROTEIN_ . however oop was able to degrade both n and c terminal fragments derived from . the degradation of these fragments was analyzed by _PROTEIN_ and confirmed by _METHOD_ . as a control for these experiments we used a catalytically inactive oop variant in which glutamine replaces the glutamate residue in the zn binding site . degradation of peptide substrates by oop and _PROTEIN_ analyzed by _METHOD_ further analysis using other peptides of various sources showed that oop can degrade several substrates and displays a substrate size restriction . the shortest peptides used in this study and degraded by oop were two octapeptides generated by the yeast processing peptidase from yeast and and the longest one was the aa presequence of the yeast preprotein . oop was unable to degrade a folded protein or larger peptides including amyloid and and insulin chain whereas _PROTEIN_ can degrade all these peptides except the short octapeptides . taken together the set of experiments shown in fig ref table and fig . suggest that oop can degrade peptide fragments within the range of aa . around of the presequences identified in plants are shorter than or equal to aa and thus might be potential natural substrates of oop considering solely the length criterion . on the other hand the shortest identified transit peptide is aa long and thus is potentially too long to be degraded by oop . as a proof of principle we selected two of the a. thaliana presequences within this size limit for degradation presequence of the ribosomal protein and the presequence of the aminocyclopropane _PROTEIN_ acid deaminase the aa transit peptide of acetyl coa synthetase . both presequences and were degraded upon incubation with purified oop and also upon incubation with _PROTEIN_ . in contrast oop could not degrade the full length tpacs transit peptide but only its fragments of aa and aa . taken together all the data obtained from the _METHOD_ analysis of the oop cleavage products make it clear that oop does not exhibit a strict cleavage pattern . although the reduced number of different substrates limits the certainty of our conclusions the results indicate that oop has a preference for hydrophobic residues at the position . interestingly in a similar set of substrates _PROTEIN_ showed a preference for positively charged residues at the position . the biochemical analysis of peptide cleavage by oop revealed a substrate length restriction and a relative promiscuity in the peptide cleavage sites . for a deeper insight into the molecular determinants of peptide degradation by oop we solved the crystal structure of oop . crystals of wild type and the inactive variant were obtained . the crystals belonged to the space group contained one molecule per asymmetric unit and diffracted to . oop exhibits an overall ellipsoidal shape and consists of two major domains which enclose the catalytic cavity . the oop homolog e. coli dipeptidyl _PROTEIN_ has been crystallized in a closed conformation similar to the oop structure presented here _METHOD_ . in contrast to the closed conformation of oop the mammalian homologs neurolysin and thimet oligopeptidase were crystallized in open conformations . the catalytic site of oop is buried within a long internal cavity . the overall fold of oop is the same as neurolysin _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and top _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the _METHOD_ values are relatively large because oop is in a closed conformation whereas the other two are in an open conformation . the total volume of the internal cavity in oop is which corresponds to the volume of a peptide with about aa . this value agrees well with maximum peptide length that oop can cleave as shown by our activity measurements . the internal cavity of oop has two narrow openings to the outside solvent but it is very unlikely that a peptide could enter the protein via these narrow openings . supporting this idea is the _PROTEIN_ that substitutions closing the openings to the outside have little effect on oop activity . thus it is conceivable that substrate binding to oop requires the opening of the structure between domains i and ii resembling the deep crevice observed in the neurolysin structure . the structural superposition shown in fig ref between oop and neurolysin highlights the conformational flexibility needed to allow the peptide substrate access to the active site . oop contains the active site sequence motif hexxh characteristic for the whole ma clan of zinc metallopeptidases . the two histidines in this motif and coordinate the zn ion with the more c terminal residue acting as the third zinc ligand . the nature and location of the ion was confirmed via anomalous data collected at the zinc edge on the structure . the glutamate residue is proposed to be important in coordinating a water molecule taking part in the nucleophilic attack of the scissile bond . in agreement with this notion replacing this residue by glutamine completely inactivates the enzyme . despite being crystallized in the absence of added substrate residual electron density became visible within the active site of during refinement and accounted for a bound peptide . the electron density at the active site allowed the building of a tetrapeptide backbone trace but with no discernible side chains . this absence of side chains is a consequence of the conformational ensembles of multiple ligands and is typical for a mixture of endogenous peptides as seen before in other examples of peptide binding proteins . we have crystallized a trapped uncleaved peptide ensemble likely similar to the initial peptide binding intermediate in the wild type enzyme . the peptide substrate is buried within the catalytic cavity and bound via hydrogen bonds to five residues in the active site and . interactions between the peptide backbone and these residues likely determine the correct positioning of the substrate for catalysis . in support of this idea substitution of or for phenylalanine abolishes the activity of the enzyme . it is noteworthy that the peptide _PROTEIN_ chain does not seem to be anchored because no salt bridges are formed to the peptide termini . also the weak electron density suggests that the peptide continues into the cavities on both sides of the active site . the pockets that can accommodate the side chains of the peptide provide both _PROTEIN_ and hydrophobic binding surfaces and therefore do not impose strict sequence specificity on the substrate . this lack of strict sequence specificity is in agreement with the observed promiscuity in the cleavage of the tested peptide substrates with only a weak preference for hydrophobic residues at the position . to identify the endogenous peptides _METHOD_ analysis of the peptides extracted from was performed . we detected a mixture of at least different peptides originating from different proteins . the peptides range from to residues in length and most probably correspond only to a subset of the peptides bound to . the sizes are fully consistent with the internal volume of the oop cavity and the analyzed peptide substrates . the structure of wild type oop was virtually identical to that of _METHOD_ with the major exception that no substrate was bound in the active site . this lack of a bound substrate was expected because the protein is still active and any endogenous substrate would have been cleaved already .
