mitochondria undertake the process of oxidative phosphorylation yielding _PROTEIN_ for plant cell _PROTEIN_ and growth . the principles of isolation and fractionation of plant mitochondrial proteins have been improved over decades and surveys of the mitochondrial proteome in a number of plants species have been performed . over time many quantitative analyses of changes in the plant mitochondrial proteome have been performed by gel analyses revealing the induction degradation and modification of mitochondrial proteins in responses to mutation stress and development . here we present a saturating _METHOD_ analysis of gel separable protein spots from a typical purification of arabidopsis mitochondria identifying proteins alongside an _METHOD_ survey by methods identifying proteins . this allowed us to characterise the major mitochondrial proteins that are not observed on gels the common contaminants and the abundance of the protein machinery of key mitochondrial biochemical pathways and consider the impact of cleavage and phosphorylation as explanations of multiple protein spots and the of proteins on gels .
many studies have assessed whole proteome changes in plant mitochondria in and mutant lines in response to development oxidative and environmental stress and the majority of these studies involved the use of electrophoretic separations of proteins . this typically involves isolating mitochondria by centrifugation methods comparisons of many separately stained gels or incorporation of cydyes to allow fewer gels to be compared followed by calculations of abundance changes of protein spots defined by molecular _METHOD_ ief point and identification of protein spots by _METHOD_ . although the limitations of organelle purity following differential and density centrifugation in the isolation mitochondria and of gel electrophoresis for the separation of mitochondrial proteins is often acknowledged in these studies no systematic study has investigated how these limitations may affect the interpretation of experiments utilising these techniques . a thorough knowledge of all proteins contained in a spot and all instances of the presence of a given protein in a gel greatly aids the correct interpretation of data sets generated for quantitative _PROTEIN_ . to facilitate such an analysis for mitochondria arabidopsis cell culture mitochondrial proteins were separated in the first dimension from pi and in the second dimension by mr and the major spots were selected for identification from a single gel by _METHOD_ using a short gradient _METHOD_ analysis pipeline . from these spots a list of protein identifications were made representing protein identifications of which were confirmed as a list of mitochondrial proteins . this data set compares to previous studies of mitochondrial proteomes that have found citation and citation proteins in arabidopsis proteins in rice citation and proteins in pea citation . a spot 's abundance was then calculated as a percentage of gel abundance by analysis and the proportion of each protein in that spot where possible was assigned using empai citation and tabulated in supporting information table . the confirmation of mitochondrial localisation was determined from online data repositories of both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ localisations and manual literature searches and assigned as either mitochondrial other or dual . in parallel another mitochondrial sample was analysed using eight iterative _METHOD_ runs that identified mitochondrial proteins and the relative abundance was again calculated by empai citation . these data sets and their comparison provide a valuable insight into arabidopsis mitochondria and allow novel evaluation of their composition as well as the technical and biological limitations of a gradient purification and _PROTEIN_ analysis of plant mitochondria . using these data we address seven key issues in the following sections to provide a wider framework for working with gel separations of plant mitochondrial proteins and a range of supplementary data resources for researchers using these techniques . while a range of techniques for organelle isolation to have been used for detailed proteome analysis of mitochondria citation citation these tools are require large amounts of starting material and are not feasible for many types of analysis . most reported analyses use density gradient purified organelles which have typically a purity level . the contaminants of mitochondrial preparations from other cellular locations provide a significant _PROTEIN_ to researchers wishing to quantitatively assess changes in mitochondrial proteomes at the protein level . from the proteins identified from the separation of mitochondrial proteins isolated by a classical gradient approach we have identified likely contaminating proteins from spots which represents of the protein spot abundance separated on gels . we acknowledge that some proportion may represent genuinely proteins but none are proteins experimentally defined to have in arabidopsis . in some cases these contaminants are identifications from the same spots that contain major mitochondrial proteins . this depth was achieved by analysis performed by a short gradient _METHOD_ of each spot which yielded on average _METHOD_ spectra for evaluation from each gel spot . these contaminants have been classified by their cellular origin in fig . which shows the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as the major sources of contamination while the cytoplasm _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins and the _LOCATION_ also contribute . the most abundant contaminating proteins included the _LOCATION_ proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . proteins of glycolysis that are known to associate with mitochondria were present as contaminants including aldolase phosphoglycerate mutase and enolase and gapdh . also the cytoplasmic _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ associated _PROTEIN_ were major contaminants . many of these proteins have previously been found by researchers in arabidopsis mitochondria for example citation citation citation citation _PROTEIN_ citation _PROTEIN_ citation citation citation . knowledge of the constituents of each protein spot and their origin is vital when assessing quantitative protein changes by _PROTEIN_ for example spot in this analysis contains the major mitochondrial protein _PROTEIN_ and the contaminating cytoplasmic protein phosphoglycerate mutase . _PROTEIN_ makes up of the protein spot and phosphoglycerate mutase so if phosphoglycerate mutase was to increase fourfold spot would increase threefold and this could be misinterpreted as _PROTEIN_ increasing in abundance . many quantitative comparative analyses reveal a limited number of significant protein abundance changes while the larger group of known proteins in the samples which were not identified is often assumed not to have changed in abundance . often both sets of data are used to formulate the biological insights of an experiment . however many proteins are excluded from gels and thus their absence from a list of changing proteins can not simply be interpreted as evidence that they did not significantly change . similarly it is well recognised that some very hydrophobic subunits of multiprotein complexes often stain poorly when compared to their hydrophilic subunits citation . we have compared the proteins found by _PROTEIN_ with the data set from _METHOD_ to identify proteins that appear to be excluded from _PROTEIN_ . we found proteins that have an abundance that would suggest they should be visualised in a colloidal _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and selected for _METHOD_ in our estimation but are absent from the _PROTEIN_ analysis . we have then investigated possible reasons for their exclusion by assessing their mr pi and number of transmembrane domains . this shows that the presence of transmembrane domains high pi and small mr appear to be the major _PROTEIN_ that lead to these proteins not being detected by _PROTEIN_ along with a very minor contribution of large mr and low pi proteins . only four of these proteins have previously been claimed to be identified by standard _PROTEIN_ citation citation citation citation . the major inner _LOCATION_ protein components of the mitochondrial electron transfer chain and members of the mitochondrial substrate carrier family dominate this list . these proteins potentially play major roles particularly in the stress response of mitochondria hence not considering them by the biological interpretation of _PROTEIN_ alone may lead to spurious conclusions . this data set also gives us an opportunity to highlight the mitochondrial proteins that are likely to be mitochondrial contaminants in _PROTEIN_ analysis of other cellular compartments and that are likely to be the principle mitochondrial markers in whole cell _PROTEIN_ experiments . we have selected proteins that have an abundance > of total mitochondria and suggest these proteins are likely to be present in such analyses . in _PROTEIN_ of the highlighted proteins have to date already been claimed to be localised in cellular compartments other than the mitochondria although they are clearly mitochondrial in origin . for example _PROTEIN_ has many lines of evidence for being mitochondria but also five _METHOD_ of other cellular localisations in four different compartments _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . similarly the major mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ has six literature _METHOD_ of other cellular localisations in three different compartments _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . we hope this list will aid the wider plant proteomics community as to the correct origin of the major mitochondrial proteins to assist more accurate interpretation of quantitative _PROTEIN_ analyses of other organelles . another important consideration when interpreting quantitative _PROTEIN_ analyses is the number of times a particular protein is found in different locations on a _PROTEIN_ separation of proteins . if you see one protein spot increase in abundance through quantitative analysis care must be taken to ensure that this has significance in a subsequent biological interpretation . for example if the protein spot observed to change is just a small component to the total protein content this increase may result in a very small change in this protein 's overall abundance . also if a protein spot that increased is a breakdown or truncated product then this may suggest an increase in protein degradation rather than an overall increase in protein abundance . similarly a small population of a protein may migrate to a different location on a _PROTEIN_ as a result of modifications . in any case it is important to recognise which proteins occur in multiple locations on _PROTEIN_ gels and which protein spots contain the bulk of a given protein . supporting information table provides a list ranked by protein annotation and their locations on a _PROTEIN_ gel multiple entries for many proteins highlight multiple spot locations . for example was found in spots clearly the majority of this protein is found in spot and multiple explanations are required for the presence of the other spots . the identification of in spots and could be from the dominant spot or may be slightly more or less acidic variants of given the absence of other proteins in spots and the latter _METHOD_ the most likely . similarly spots and both containing appear in the pi range compared to the dominant spot which is close to pi like spots and these shifts in pi may result from a modification . interestingly even the dominant spot appears some distance from its predicted pi of probably due to cleavage of the for this protein . as for spots and that contained these spots occurred at a much lower mr than expected for and thus are likely breakdown products . other proteins appearing often in multiple spots were citrate synthase _PROTEIN_ subunit _PROTEIN_ subunit elongation _PROTEIN_ tu and formate dehydrogenase . over of proteins identified were found in at least two protein spots . the quantitative analysis of this arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ proteome also allowed us an insight into the proportion of total mitochondrial protein that can be attributed to different mitochondrial metabolic processes . less than of the identified proteins in this study accounted for nearly of the mitochondrial gel protein abundance . the _PROTEIN_ synthase is known to dominate the inner mitochondrial _LOCATION_ and contains a large number of soluble proteins in the structure . seven subunits of the _PROTEIN_ synthase were detected by gel analysis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ while _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was shown to be excluded from gel analysis . in total the _PROTEIN_ synthase proteins found on the gel accounted for of total mitochondrial proteins . the nine enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle consist of protein subunits encoded by genes . these account for of the total mitochondrial protein on the gels . however some interesting caveats must be highlighted in this estimation . for example while the three subunit pyruvate dehydrogenase complex accounted for of protein the similar dehydrogenase complex appeared to only account for however the high molecular _METHOD_ subunit of this enzyme was shown to be excluded from analysis and thus it is likely to be an underestimate . also while various components or _METHOD_ of malate dehydrogenase succinate dehydrogenase succinyl coa synthetase and aconitase appear to be very abundant proteins fumarase and isocitrate dehydrogenase appeared to be quite low in abundance . the low abundances of two key tca cycle proteins in a mitochondrial pathway also give an indication of the different catalytic rates of enzymes in this cycle . for example we have already reported that fumarase has a similar activity in cell culture mitochondria to pyruvate or dehydrogenase complexes citation while the protein abundances here indicate a fold lower abundance of fumarase . however it should be noted that protein abundance itself is only one component of defining metabolic capacity and thorough analysis of enzyme activity and kinetics and knowledge of the prevailing substrate availability is also essential . for the tca cycle this has been illustrated by the variation of protein abundances enzyme capacities and substrate concentrations during the diurnal cycle citation citation . the mitochondrial heat shock proteins accounted for of total mitochondrial protein content while the outer _LOCATION_ porin made up of the proteome . interestingly a series of unknown function proteins make up more than of the protein in mitochondria . these calculations however carry the caveat that some components may be excluded from analysis so care needs to be taken when attempting to interpret a whole pathway by _PROTEIN_ alone . a considerable advantage of a _PROTEIN_ arraying system is the ability to directly visualise the intact proteins and extract information in the form of a protein 's molecular weight and charge . such features are especially significant when examining mitochondria where many proteins are imported as precursors and processed during the import process to form the mature functional enzymes . consequently the functionally active form of the polypeptide can not be directly inferred from its gene sequence . an examination of the mr and pi of proteins identified from the arabidopsis mitochondrial reference _PROTEIN_ for both calculated and experimentally determined values indicates a wide range of proteins are represented . the calculated pi values of the proteins identified by the _METHOD_ range from to and mr values of to kda which is very similar to the experimentally determined pi values and the mr values that range from to kda estimated from the _PROTEIN_ . however a comparison of the pi values between calculated and experimentally derived values for each protein indicate a poor relationship with a pearson correlation coefficient of . a comparison of the mr values between the calculated and estimated experimental values for each protein produced a far higher correlation with an r value of . this indicates that the effect of processing or cleavage is far greater on the pi of a protein than on the mr . this finding is consistent with the relatively short length of plant mitochondrial which average forty amino acids in length and would thus have a limited effect on the migration of a processed protein through _PROTEIN_ citation . furthermore the removal of the with its high proportion of basic amino acids would likely have a major effect on the pi of a protein and hence its migration during _PROTEIN_ citation . to more precisely examine the ability of _PROTEIN_ to provide accurate information on proteins we compiled a set of arabidopsis mitochondrial proteins with experimentally determined processing sites . until fairly recently many of these processing sites were determined by sequencing of a protein arrayed by _PROTEIN_ and only a handful of sites were known citation . however recently we conducted a proteomics survey of arabidopsis mitochondria and identified the processing sites of proteins citation . by combining these studies and affirming their presence on the arabidopsis mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ we were able to assemble a total of proteins with known experimental processing sites . the pi and mr of these mature or processed proteins were calculated and used to more accurately assess the performance of _PROTEIN_ in providing precise information . while a number of proteins are present in multiple positions throughout the _PROTEIN_ we identified the most representative candidate by assessing its abundance and its relationship to other proteins identified in a given sample or gel spot . the correlation between the _PROTEIN_ pi and the calculated pi for the mature or processed proteins is strong with an r value of and indicates that the use of _PROTEIN_ is a valuable tool in accurately determining the pi of a protein . furthermore when these findings are examined in the context of the analysis outlined above where the _PROTEIN_ pi and the calculated pi had a relatively poor correlation with an r value of it _METHOD_ that a significant number of mitochondrial proteins contain sites or other modifications . the effect of experimental processing on the migration of a protein through _PROTEIN_ was also examined . this analysis produced a high correlation with an r value of demonstrating the effects of processing on the _METHOD_ of the mature protein . it is significant that this correlation is higher between the _PROTEIN_ values and the calculated mr values for the experimentally determined mature mitochondrial proteins than for the whole protein set . the identification of a protein in a sample only represents a single facet in its characterisation by _METHOD_ and may have little relevance to its potential functional state . protein phosphorylation represents one of the most common modifications within the cell and is a rapid means by which the cell can modulate and its cellular processes in response to a myriad of stimuli citation . the analysis of protein phosphorylation by _METHOD_ has been revolutionised in recent years by the development of reproducible phosphopeptide enrichment strategies that have enabled the identification of thousands of sites citation . while such studies have provided large data sets the real interest to biologists is in examining the modulation or change in phosphorylation states of a protein . since _PROTEIN_ provides a visual array of the sample and phosphorylation affects the net charge of a protein changes to the pi are often discernable . the power of this method was highlighted recently by a brassinosteroid induction of phosphorylation of a kinase from _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ samples by _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ citation . plant mitochondria contain a number of phosphoproteins including the subunit of the pyrvate dehydrogenase complex that regulates the entry of pyruvate into the tca cycle citation . a recent survey of the arabidopsis mitochondrial phosphoproteome identified putative phosphoproteins with evidence for five citation . moreover a number of phosphopeptides derived from mitochondrial proteins have been identified in the numerous phosphopeptide enrichment studies from arabidopsis citation . in order to examine the potential effect of phosphorylation on the _PROTEIN_ distribution we collated all known mitochondrial phosphoproteins identified by the _PROTEIN_ . a total of proteins had been previously determined as phosphorylated through phosphopeptide characterisation citation and/or citation and identified as mitochondrial on the _PROTEIN_ . a total of of these phosphoproteins were identified in more than one position on the _PROTEIN_ indicating evidence for modulation by some sort of modification . as outlined above not all shifts in pi are the results of modifications with degradation or processing also resulting in considerable changes to a proteins net charge . consequently we examined the multiple occurrences of these potentially proteins and disregarded obvious mr changes and utilised an online utility to estimate the minimum pi shift required for each protein if phosphorylated citation . depending on a protein 's primary sequence a pi shift of as little as can be the result of protein phosphorylation . a total of proteins were identified with significant pi shifts and minimal differences in their apparent mr . these proteins included the two _METHOD_ of the subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex which is a known protein found within the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ . the majority of spots containing these proteins were identified in the acidic region of the _PROTEIN_ although one isoform was identified at a neutral region . analysis of these sequences by promost indicated a neutral pi for the unmodified protein and an acidic shift of approximately ph units . in contrast previous analyses of the arabidopsis mitochondrial phosphoproteome by _PROTEIN_ using identified both _METHOD_ of the phosphorylated subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex in the neutral position around spot citation . these data indicate that the unphosphorylated form of this protein shifts over ph units when arrayed by _PROTEIN_ . other phosphoproteins that produced significant pi shifts under _PROTEIN_ were glutamate dehydrogenase with and ph units ligase adenylate kinase and cysteine synthase . previous of _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis mitochondrial samples indicate that the most abundant form of the ligase is the phosphorylated form and that glutamate dehydrogenase is present phosphorylated in the neutral region of the _PROTEIN_ and unphosphorylated _METHOD_ shift towards the acidic end of the gel . these observations can also provide an indication as to the state of a protein as both modified and unmodified _METHOD_ can be observed and quantified .
an arabidopsis suspension cell culture has been _PROTEIN_ and subcultured as stated elsewhere citation . briefly ml of a cell culture grown in the light were transferred into ml of fresh medium . starting material for the mitochondrial preparation was grown in the dark for days whereas material used for the _PROTEIN_ of the culture was incubated in the light for the same period of time . mitochondria were purified from arabidopsis cell cultures essentially as described previously citation . specifically g fresh weight of cells were filtered through miracloth and transferred to a waring blender . three hundred millilitres extraction buffer per five flasks of culture were added . cells were then blended for s at high speed and two cycles of s at low speed leaving s in between each burst . the blended extract was filtered through one layer of cheesecloth and two layers of miracloth and transferred to centrifuge tubes . the extract was centrifuged at for min and the supernatant centrifuged at for min . the pellet was in ml wash buffer _PROTEIN_ and loaded onto a step percoll gradient made up using buffer _PROTEIN_ . gradients were centrifuged at for min . mitochondria were visible as a whitish/brown band at the interface . mitochondria were collected and washed in wash buffer . the supernatant was discarded and the pellet washed again . mitochondria were then in ml of wash buffer and purified on a percoll gradient prepared in buffer _PROTEIN_ . the gradient was centrifuged at for min . this time the mitochondria formed a whitish/brown band in the upper part of the gradient . the mitochondria were washed as described previously with wash buffer and in approximately ml of wash buffer . all steps were performed at . this was carried as described in taylor et al . citation briefly mg of mitochondrial proteins were acetone precipitated and solubilised in of ief sample buffer consisting of m urea m thiourea w/v chaps v/v ampholytes mm tributylphosphine and w/v bromphenol blue yielding a final protein concentration of mg/ml . aliquots were used to dried mm nonlinear immobilised ph gradient strips overnight and then ief was performed for h reaching a total of kvh at on a electrophoresis unit . immobilised ph gradient strips were then transferred to an equilibration buffer consisting of mm m urea w/v _PROTEIN_ w/v bromphenol blue and mm and incubated for min at room temperature with rocking . the equilibrated strips were then slotted into central single wells of w/v acrylamide stacking gels above cm w/v acrylamide and w/v _PROTEIN_ gels . gel electrophoresis was performed at v with circulating cooling and completed in h. proteins were visualised by colloidal _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ staining . quantification of protein abundance following _PROTEIN_ separation of proteins was carried out using the progenesis samespots software package . the gel was scanned on a microtek scanmaker and saved as a image . analysis was carried out using the default analysis wizard . following spot detection all spots were manually inspected and where required manual corrections to spot detection was carried out and spot volumes were . the relative abundance of each gel spot was calculated as a percentage of all spots selected from the gel . where sufficient spectral data was available the relative spot abundance was assigned to individual proteins identified in the spot based on the exponentially modified protein abundance index values obtained directly from mascot _PROTEIN_ . the spot abundance from progenesis samespots was divided by the relative empai values reported to yield gel ab . for _PROTEIN_ arrayed samples visually selected protein spots were cut from the gels twice for min in mm and v/v acn . samples were dehydrated at in a dry block heater for min and with digestion solution and incubated overnight at . peptides were extracted by adding acn and vigorous shaking for min removing liquid and adding of acn and formic acid to the gel plugs followed by another min of shaking washes were pooled after each extraction step . samples were analysed according to tan et al . citation . this involved samples being loaded onto microsorb reverse phase columns using an agilent technologies series capillary liquid chromatography system and eluted into an agilent _PROTEIN_ ultra iontrap _METHOD_ spectrometer with an esi source equipped with a low flow nebuliser in positive mode and controlled by _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ selective detection _METHOD_ trap control v software . peptides were eluted from the reverse phase column at using a min acn gradient in v/v formic acid at a regulated temperature of . the method used for initial ion detection utilised a _METHOD_ range of m/z with scan mode set to standard and ion charge control conditions set at and three averages taken per scan . smart mode parameter settings were employed using a target of m/z a compound stability _PROTEIN_ of a trap drive level of and optimise set to normal . ions were selected for _METHOD_ after reaching an intensity of cps and two precursor ions were selected from the initial _METHOD_ scan . _METHOD_ conditions employed smartfrag for ion fragmentation a scan range of m/z using an average of three scans the exclusion of singly charged ions option and ion charge control conditions set to in ultra scan mode . resulting _METHOD_ spectra were exported from the dataanalysis for _METHOD_ trap version software package using default parameters for _METHOD_ and compound export . extracted results were queried against the arabidopsis protein set using the mascot search engine _PROTEIN_ utilising _LOCATION_ tolerances of da for _METHOD_ and da for _METHOD_ max missed cleavages set to with variable modifications of oxidation _PROTEIN_ instrument set to and peptide charge set at and . results were filtered using standard scoring max . number of hits set to significance threshold at p < and ions score at homology level approximately . to obtain an estimated false detection rate _PROTEIN_ value at the ion score level all spectra from the spots were concatenated into a single file and the ion score of provided an _PROTEIN_ of . data files for the protein spots analyses have been annotated according to _PROTEIN_ and submitted to the proteome commons tranche repository . this data can be retrieved by using the following hash . for analyses analysis was conducted according to huang et al . citation . this involved of isolated mitochondria being acetone precipitated and in m triethylammonium bicarbonate and w/v _PROTEIN_ . the sample was then treated with mm and incubated for h at followed by min at rt in mm methyl _PROTEIN_ . the sample was then digested by the addition of trypsin and incubated overnight at at a final protein concentration of mg/ml . the resulting peptides were centrifuged at to remove insoluble components and vacuum centrifugation used to dry the supernatant . the sample was then diluted fourfold with strong cation exchange buffer a and subjected to batch strong cation exchange chromatography using an cartridge . the eluent was dried by vacuum concentration and stored at for analysis . prior to analysis peptides were in v/v acn and v/v formic acid . samples were analysed via an hplc _PROTEIN_ cube source into an agilent _METHOD_ spectrometer . the _PROTEIN_ was a nl enrichment column and a mm separation column driven by an agilent technologies series nano/capillary liquid chromatography system . both _METHOD_ were controlled by _METHOD_ workstation data acquisition for . peptides were loaded onto the trapping column at in v/v acn and v/v formic acid with the _PROTEIN_ switched to enrichment and using the capillary pump . the _PROTEIN_ was then switched to separation and peptides eluted during a h gradient directly into the _METHOD_ spectrometer . the instrument was operated in positive ion mode and _METHOD_ scans run over a range of m/z and at four spectra . precursor ions were selected for auto _METHOD_ at an absolute threshold of and a relative threshold of with max . three precursors per cycle and active exclusion set at two spectra and released after min . precursor selection and preference was set to and then and precursors selected by charge then abundance . resulting _METHOD_ spectra were opened in _METHOD_ workstation qualitative analysis and _METHOD_ compounds detected by find auto _METHOD_ using default settings . the resulting compounds were then exported as mzdata files that were searched against an arabidopsis database using version _PROTEIN_ of the mascot search engine . the following settings were selected for searching _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ tolerance of ppm _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ tolerance of da maximum missed cleavages tolerated as variable modifications _PROTEIN_ and oxidation peptide charge as and and finally the instrument selected as . the resulting searches were then exported and all peptides identified were at least homology extracted to create an exclusion list for the subsequent run . in all eight runs were performed and combined using mzdatacombinator _METHOD_ then searched as outlined for the exclusion lists . results were filtered using mudpit scoring max . number of hits set to auto significance threshold at p < and ions score at _PROTEIN_ for this ion score was calculated to be . the mr and pi were calculated using the pepstats and the iep applications available through the emboss software suite citation . _PROTEIN_ mr was estimated by plotting the molecular weight markers to their migration distance . the following formula was the used to calculate the mr of the proteins by the distance each migrated . _PROTEIN_ pis were calculated by dividing the nl range into increments for pi and and increments for pi . a protein 's pi was estimated to the nearest hundredth decimal place . the subcellular location of each protein identified was determined by querying both the _PROTEIN_ citation and aramenonon citation as well as manual literature searches of matched arabidopsis gene initiative numbers . if multiple localisations were assigned a majority system was employed whereby any single localisation in the majority was used to assign location unless strong evidence was available from manual literature interrogation . in supporting information tables and proteins are called either m o or d but in the list of contaminating proteins other is expanded into cytoplasm _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ and assigned by majority . where appropriate the id description was altered to better reflect the actual protein function than that described in the tair description . information on protein phosphorylation was obtained from the arabidopsis protein phosphorylation database phosphat citation . proteins excluded from the gel were determined by collating all proteins found by the approach which were not detected on the gel . each protein was then assessed for parameters by which they may exclude it from the gel such as small mr large mr low pi high pi the presence of predicted transmembrane domain or other evidence from manual literature interrogation of being _LOCATION_ proteins . proteins that did fulfill any one of these criteria were excluded and the resulting list is presented in supporting information table . major mitochondrial proteins that are likely to represent mitochondrial contaminants in other organelles or plant cell fractions were selected as proteins that were found on the gel and have an abundance of > of total mitochondrial protein and are presented in supporting information table .
