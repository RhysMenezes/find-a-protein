snares _PROTEIN_ which locate on the specific organelle _LOCATION_ assure the correct vesicular transport by mediating specific _LOCATION_ fusions . snares are referred to as r or q snares on the basis of the amino acid sequence similarities and specific conserved residues . all of the arabidopsis r snares have a n terminal domain called the longin domain _PROTEIN_ . in this study we investigated the _LOCATION_ targeting mechanism of arabidopsis r snares . the _LOCATION_ localized _PROTEIN_ was used as the mother protein of _METHOD_ tagged chimeric proteins joined to several domains such as the _PROTEIN_ the snare motif and the transmembrane domain of other organelle localized r snares . the results showed that whereas the tmd is not relevant for the _LOCATION_ targeting a complete _PROTEIN_ is essential for the _LOCATION_ and subcellular targeting .
proteins consist of three distinct domains the _PROTEIN_ snm and the transmembrane domain . amino acid sequence analysis showed that _LOCATION_ localized _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ share over similarities with each other and and similarities with _LOCATION_ localized _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized proteins respectively . in spite of the high homology of the proteins they showed different subcellular localizations . to determine the roles played by the three different domains _PROTEIN_ of proteins in _LOCATION_ sorting _PROTEIN_ was used as a model of _LOCATION_ localized protein . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were used as the pm _LOCATION_ and endosome localized proteins respectively . we have already shown that the dot structures of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were merged with the _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ and endocytic dye respectively . chimeric proteins were generated by replacing the corresponding domains of these proteins with that of _PROTEIN_ . to examine whether the tmd is the determinant for the _LOCATION_ targeting or not the _METHOD_ tagged chimeric _PROTEIN_ proteins replacing the c terminal region with those of pm localized _PROTEIN_ were transiently _PROTEIN_ in the protoplast of arabidopsis suspension cells . two different ct fragment were used in the experiments ct s including tmd and intravesicular tail and ct l including further residues from the coiled coil domain . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ type ct s and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ type ct l was observed on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ like wild type _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ type ct s and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ type ct l which contain the _LOCATION_ type of ct s and ct l respectively were appeared on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but not on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . these results suggest that the ct containing tmd is not a _LOCATION_ targeting determinant . _METHOD_ tagged truncated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ lacking the n terminal short fragment which is corresponded to the truncated _PROTEIN_ lost the _LOCATION_ targeting ability and appeared on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the small dot structures which are considered to be trans _LOCATION_ network or endosome . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ s and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ s which were the nt s deleted proteins of other _LOCATION_ localized proteins also lost their _LOCATION_ targeting properties and were localized on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the tgn/endosome . these results imply that the _PROTEIN_ may be important for the _LOCATION_ targeting of the _LOCATION_ localized vamps _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . however a substitution of the nt s of _PROTEIN_ with that of _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ did not affect the pm and the tgn/endosome localization resulting in no _LOCATION_ localization . further addition of amino acids to the nt s _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ successfully conferred the _LOCATION_ targeting . the localization of this chimeric protein was not completely the same as that of _PROTEIN_ because the pm and the tgn/endosome targeting was also observed . since the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was proposed as the default destination of single pass _LOCATION_ proteins the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization of this chimeric protein might be caused by the default transport . both the _PROTEIN_ of the _LOCATION_ type _PROTEIN_ were substituted for those of the _LOCATION_ type _PROTEIN_ and the endosome type _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ type _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ type _PROTEIN_ were localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . together with all of the data we concluded that complete _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ play a key role for the _LOCATION_ targeting . is the _PROTEIN_ capable of targeting plant also to organelle other than the _LOCATION_ ? to answer this pm type _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ type _PROTEIN_ and endosome type _PROTEIN_ were attached separately to the _LOCATION_ type snm/tmd and their subcellular localization were examined . _METHOD_ tagged pm type _PROTEIN_ was observed to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and tgn/endosome like wild type _PROTEIN_ implying that pm type _PROTEIN_ may play a role for the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ targeting . moreover _LOCATION_ type _PROTEIN_ and endosome type _PROTEIN_ was also found on the _LOCATION_ apparatus and endosomes respectively . however interestingly they also appeared on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in the case of _LOCATION_ and endosome the _PROTEIN_ domain may not be sufficient for changing the subcellular localization completely . the snm or tmd also might affect the subcellular localization .
the cdnas for arabidopsis proteins have been isolated by rt pcr . by using these cdnas as templates the cdna fragment necessary for the chimeric recombination was amplified by using sequential pcr methods . open reading frames of the amplified chimeric cdna were fused to the orfs of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of the _METHOD_ vector . for the c terminal replacement study cdnas that corresponded to residues and of _PROTEIN_ or residues and of _PROTEIN_ were used . for the n terminal deletion or replacement studies cdnas that corresponded to residues and of _PROTEIN_ residues of _PROTEIN_ residues of _PROTEIN_ residues of _PROTEIN_ residues of _PROTEIN_ or residues of _PROTEIN_ were used . the transient _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ fused proteins in arabidopsis suspension cultured cells was performed as described previously . briefly g of cultured cells was incubated in ml of enzyme solution for h at and filtered with a nylon mesh . the resultant protoplasts were washed twice with ml of solution a and resuspended in ml of the mamg solution . after the addition of of plasmid and of carrier dna to of the protoplast solution of dna uptake solution and m ca was added . the protoplasts were incubated on ice for min and then diluted with ml of a dilution solution _PROTEIN_ . the collected protoplasts were resuspended in ml of _METHOD_ medium containing m mannitol and incubated with gentle agitation at for h in the dark . observations were done using a confocal laser scanning microscope zeiss lsm _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ equipped with green hene and argon lasers .
