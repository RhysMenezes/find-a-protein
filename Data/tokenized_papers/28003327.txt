plant cell wall proteins are important regulators of cell wall architecture and function . however because cell wall proteins are difficult to extract and analyze they are generally poorly understood . here we describe the identification and characterization of proteins integral to the arabidopsis seed coat mucilage a specialized layer of the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ composed of plant cell wall _PROTEIN_ that is used as a model for cell wall research . the proteins identified in mucilage include those previously identified by genetic analysis and several mucilage proteins are reduced in mucilage deficient mutant seeds suggesting that these proteins are genuinely associated with the mucilage . arabidopsis mucilage has both nonadherent and adherent layers . both layers have similar protein profiles except for proteins involved in lipid metabolism which are present exclusively in the adherent mucilage . the most abundant mucilage proteins include a family of proteins named _PROTEIN_ to a less abundant fourth homolog was named tba like . tba and tbal transcripts and promoter activities were detected in developing seed coats and their _PROTEIN_ requires seed coat differentiation regulators . tba proteins are secreted to the mucilage pocket during differentiation . although reverse genetics failed to identify a function for tbas/tbal the tba promoters are highly _PROTEIN_ and cell type specific and so should be very useful tools for targeting proteins to the seed coat epidermis . altogether these results highlight the mucilage proteome as a model for cell walls in general as it shares similarities with other cell wall proteomes while also containing mucilage specific features .
in order to identify and characterize proteins integral to the seed coat mucilage a protocol was developed to extract seed coat mucilage for protein analyses . upon hydration arabidopsis seed coat epidermal cells extrude mucilage as two distinct layers an outer nonadherent layer that detaches easily from the hydrated seed and a dense halo like adherent layer that is bound tightly to the seed coat . we took advantage of the different physical properties of these two layers to separate them by sequential extraction . seeds imbibed in water were shaken gently to separate the nonadherent mucilage . the seeds were then shaken at high speed for several hours to remove the adherent mucilage . ruthenium red and calcofluor white staining showed that the pectin and cellulosic components of seed coat mucilage were almost completely removed by the sequential extraction . the harvested adherent and nonadherent mucilage samples were chemically deglycosylated trypsin digested and analyzed by _METHOD_ to identify mucilage associated proteins in these samples . of those proteins detected by this process only the ones identified in more than one biological replicate with mascot scores greater than and at least once with multiple peptides were considered for further analyses . based on these criteria proteins were considered to be robustly identified from mucilage all containing predicted signal peptides . cruciferin and cruciferin c were discarded from further analyses since they are not known to be secreted to the apoplast . this leaves a total potential mucilage proteins identified . one protein was found only in the nonadherent layer only in the adherent layer and the remaining proteins were found in both mucilage layers . when proteins found in each mucilage layer were sorted by their predicted functions most fell within the various functional categories of cell wall proteins as defined by citation . these categories include _PROTEIN_ active enzymes oxidoreductases proteases proteins involved in lipid metabolism arabinogalactan proteins as well as miscellaneous proteins and proteins with unknown functions . the _PROTEIN_ that seed coat mucilage associated proteins appear to be functionally similar to proteins from other arabidopsis cell wall proteomes reinforces the concept that seed coat mucilage is a specialized type of cell wall . on the other hand nearly half of the specific mucilage associated protein _METHOD_ were unique to mucilage and not identified in other cell wall proteomes to date including a family of unknown proteins rmlc like cupin superfamily proteins and gdsl lipases . homologs of the rmlc like cupin superfamily proteins and gdsl lipases are commonly found in other cell walls suggesting that these proteins may represent mucilage specific _METHOD_ . in general the adherent layer displays a richer and more diverse protein profile compared with the nonadherent layer including proteins that are unique to the adherent layer . interestingly this adherent specific group includes a number of proteins involved in lipid metabolism . otherwise the numbers of proteins that belong to each predicted functional class are more or less comparable between the two mucilage layers . this suggests that the types of protein mediated biological processes associated with mucilage modification in the apoplast are comparable within the two layers . since the seeds from which mucilage was obtained in these experiments had not been processed in any way prior to hydration and mucilage extraction the possibility remains that the proteins we identified originate from sources other than the mucilage . in order to address this concern the nonadherent mucilage protein profiles obtained from col seeds were compared with protein profiles obtained from the seed surface extracts from the mucilage mutants _PROTEIN_ and apetala . _PROTEIN_ seeds synthesize mucilage but do not extrude it when hydrated whereas seed coat epidermal cells fail to differentiate and therefore do not synthesize mucilage . since mucilage can only be extracted from hydrated col seeds proteins that are significantly overrepresented in col nonadherent mucilage compared with _PROTEIN_ and/or seed surface extracts would be predicted to be derived from the extruded mucilage . several mucilage proteins identified were indeed found at much higher levels in col compared with _PROTEIN_ and . overall the recovery of mucilage associated protein was reduced by when _PROTEIN_ seed was used and by when seed was used compared with col seed . these data support the hypothesis that proteins identified in this study are derived from extruded mucilage of seed coat epidermal cells and not from the primary wall . the collection of enzymes identified by our proteomics analyses includes all the secreted enzymes required for normal mucilage extrusion that have been identified previously by genetic analysis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and . their identification here thus validates the robustness of the proteomic analysis . in an attempt to determine the roles of other mucilage proteins we identified plant lines with t dna insertions in the genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ aspartic protease in guard _PROTEIN_ auxin _PROTEIN_ in responsive to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were characterized . these genes were chosen because they do not appear to have homologs that are also _PROTEIN_ in seed coat epidermal cells thus _PROTEIN_ the possibility of functional redundancy obscuring mutant phenotypes . in each case the t dna insertion _PROTEIN_ or eliminated the steady state levels of transcript in homozygous lines . seeds of each insertional mutant were imbibed in water m edta m or m stained with ruthenium red and examined for seed mucilage abnormalities . edta is believed to loosen mucilage by disrupting the homogalacturonan salt bridges through chelation . treatment also loosens mucilage possibly by cleaving cross linking ester bonds between homogalacturonan polymers . in contrast mucilage extruded in a solution is more compact and stains more intensely with ruthenium red than mucilage extruded in water presumably by enhancing salt bridging between mucilage homogalacturonan molecules . however no clear mucilage defects were found in any mucilage protein mutant lines under the conditions tested suggesting that if the corresponding gene products have a role in mucilage modification the mutant phenotype must be relatively subtle or conditional . among the mucilage proteins identified three proteins of the unknown protein family _GENE_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ were of particular interest because they were consistently identified as the most abundant proteins in almost all samples . consistent with these protein data the corresponding genes were found to be _PROTEIN_ in the seed coat at very high levels . however the proteins encoded by these genes do not contain known functional domains other than putative signal peptides so no function has been ascribed to them to date . members of the protein family are strongly conserved as they share amino acid sequence identity and similarity with one another . furthermore the loci that encode these proteins are tightly clustered on chromosome suggesting that the gene family may have expanded through tandem duplication events . due to the abundance of the proteins in the seed coat these genes were named _PROTEIN_ and . interestingly a peptide from a fourth member of the family _GENE_ also was detected in adherent mucilage . however _GENE_ was identified with only one peptide with a score below the cutoff for statistical significance . due to the strong similarities in amino acid sequences and _PROTEIN_ patterns between _GENE_ and the tba proteins _GENE_ was named tba like . tbas are small proteins with many conserved ser and thr residues predicted by netoglyc to be o glycosylated . these characteristics suggest that tbas and tbal may function as structural proteins that interact with various polysaccharides in seed coat mucilage . public microarray data suggest that tba and tbal are _PROTEIN_ uniquely in the seed coat and reverse transcription pcr results are consistent with this pattern . tba and tbal transcripts could only be detected in siliques and more specifically in the and d post anthesis _PROTEIN_ seed coat . _PROTEIN_ levels are by far the highest and peaked at _PROTEIN_ whereas the _PROTEIN_ levels of the remaining genes were lower and peaked at _PROTEIN_ . to verify the _PROTEIN_ pattern of tba and tbal reporter assays were performed on tissues of plants carrying chimeric genes encoding the gus gene under the control of the tba and tbal native promoters . consistent with rt pcr data gus activity could be detected in developing seeds at and _PROTEIN_ but not in seedlings leaves _METHOD_ and embryos . gus under the control of appeared earlier compared with other promoters although in general all tba and tbal promoters were active by _PROTEIN_ . these data support the hypothesis that all four promoters are active primarily in the seed coat . the _PROTEIN_ that the tba promoter gus patterns mirror the presence of tba transcripts implies that the _PROTEIN_ of the tba genes is largely regulated by their upstream cis regulatory elements . several transcription _PROTEIN_ are known to regulate the differentiation of seed coat epidermis and the synthesis of seed coat mucilage . some of these master regulators include nac regulated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and transparent _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . since the tba genes are _PROTEIN_ exclusively in the seed coat we asked whether they are under the control of these transcription _PROTEIN_ . rt pcr results showed that tba and tbal transcripts were absent in developing seeds of both the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant and _PROTEIN_ which suggests that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are all required for tba and tbal _PROTEIN_ . intriguingly transcripts appear to be absent in the landsberg _LOCATION_ ecotype suggesting that there may be tba _PROTEIN_ variation among different natural accessions . the subcellular localization of tbas was characterized using c terminally tagged citrine yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tba translational fusion constructs driven by their endogenous promoters . in agreement with the _PROTEIN_ data _METHOD_ signals were detected in the developing seed coat . no _METHOD_ signal was observed in _PROTEIN_ seeds . by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ could be detected in the seed coat epidermal _PROTEIN_ cell walls and the developing mucilage pockets . all three tbas could be detected in the mucilage pockets by _PROTEIN_ . by _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ signal was absent from the mucilage pocket but was observed in the developing columella . this _PROTEIN_ pattern coincides spatiotemporally with the tba transcript and promoter activity patterns and reinforces the characterization of tba proteins as mucilage proteins . furthermore _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected only in the outer epidermal layer of the seed coat suggesting that tba proteins may only be synthesized in mucilage secretory cells . despite the _PROTEIN_ that tbas were initially identified in mature mucilage tba _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was absent from mucilage pockets by _PROTEIN_ which raised the possibility that tbas might be unstable proteins . to test this idea immunoblot experiments were performed to try to detect tba _METHOD_ extracted from developing siliques . interestingly full length tba _METHOD_ proteins were difficult to detect in the siliques of tba _METHOD_ transgenic plants by immunoblotting . the abundance of tba _METHOD_ was quite variable among different lines and _METHOD_ appears to be partially insoluble . these results suggest that tba _METHOD_ proteins are likely unstable and may undergo proteolysis or other posttranslational modification within the mucilage pocket . in an attempt to determine the function of the tba proteins we characterized tba loss of function mutants . since the three tba proteins are highly conserved and share a similar _PROTEIN_ pattern we anticipated that they might be functionally redundant . furthermore because all these genes are closely linked on the chromosome the construction of double triple and quadruple tba mutants is relatively difficult . to overcome these _METHOD_ an artificial microrna driven by the ubiquitin _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ was designed to knock down all three tba homologs and tbal simultaneously . when transcript levels in developing siliques were quantified in _PROTEIN_ tba amirna transgenic lines four lines showed significant down regulation of but only line showed significant down regulation in all three tba genes and tbal . however none of the _PROTEIN_ tba amirna lines showed any mucilage defects when their seeds were imbibed in water m edta m or m followed by ruthenium red staining . these results suggest that either the tba genes are functionally redundant even at low levels of _PROTEIN_ or that the amirna knockdown lines possess mucilage phenotypes that are not clearly discernible with ruthenium red staining .
