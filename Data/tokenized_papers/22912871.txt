the _PROTEIN_ of auxin responsive genes is regulated by the _PROTEIN_ auxin receptor dependent degradation of aux/iaa transcriptional repressors which interact with auxin responsive _PROTEIN_ . most of the aux/iaa genes present in arabidopsis have not been functionally characterized to date . _PROTEIN_ appears to have a distinct function from the other aux/iaa genes due to its unique transcriptional response to auxin and the stability of its encoded protein . in this study we characterized the function of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ in various developmental processes governed by auxin and in the transcriptional regulation of the auxin response . transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ estrogen inducible _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ exhibited significantly fewer _PROTEIN_ roots than the wild type and an _PROTEIN_ loss of function mutant exhibited significantly more . ectopic overexpression of _PROTEIN_ resulted in abnormal gravitropism . the strong induction of early auxin responsive marker genes by auxin treatment was delayed by _PROTEIN_ overexpression . _METHOD_ fusion analysis revealed that _PROTEIN_ localized not only to the _LOCATION_ but in contrast to other aux/iaas also to the _LOCATION_ . furthermore we demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ in an auxin dependent fashion and with arf proteins both in yeast and in planta . taken together our results show that _PROTEIN_ is involved in _PROTEIN_ root formation and that this process is regulated through the interaction with the _PROTEIN_ auxin receptor and arf transcription _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ .
to characterize the function of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis we generated transgenic plants that overexpress _PROTEIN_ . initially we used the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter for the overexpression however strong overexpression of _PROTEIN_ in any transgenic plants could not be confirmed . therefore the estradiol inducible promoter xve in the vector was used to create transgenic plants that conditionally and strongly _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ of xve _PROTEIN_ transgenes upon induction with estradiol was examined in over transgenic lines by semi quantitative reverse transcriptase pcr analysis . of xve _PROTEIN_ plants examined _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was induced above endogenous levels only in lines and following estradiol treatment . wild type and xve _PROTEIN_ roots treated first with estradiol for h and then with iaa for to min were subjected to semi quantitative rt pcr analysis of the auxin marker genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ together with endogenous _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ and of both endogenous and exogenous _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ . was used as an internal control . all semi quantitative rt pcr figures are representative of three biological replicates . these xve _PROTEIN_ plants were used for further experiments together with a loss of function t dna insertion mutant of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the aerial parts of _PROTEIN_ and xve _PROTEIN_ plants did not show any obvious phenotypic change compared with those of wild type col plants . the absence of visible developmental defects in a loss of function mutant of _PROTEIN_ is consistent with findings of a previous report . since several aux/iaa genes are involved in auxin related root development such as primary root elongation _PROTEIN_ root formation and grapitropism we decided to examine these auxin related root phenotypes in _PROTEIN_ and xve _PROTEIN_ plants . on normal _METHOD_ medium the phenotype of all of the genotypes examined was unaffected . following estradiol treatment the roots exhibited growth defects even in col seedlings . the seedlings of both xve _PROTEIN_ lines treated with estradiol exhibited abnormal gravitropism and had more severe root growth defects than estradiol treated col plants . however there was not a statistically significant difference in primary root growth between col and any of the genotypes treated with estradiol . in contrast the number of _PROTEIN_ roots in both _PROTEIN_ and one of estradiol treated xve _PROTEIN_ plants was altered . a significant increase in the number of _PROTEIN_ roots was observed in _PROTEIN_ as compared with col whereas the number of _PROTEIN_ roots in one of estradiol treated xve _PROTEIN_ plants which displayed a strong abnormal root phenotype was reduced . in addition the gravitropic response of estradiol treated xve _PROTEIN_ plants was also diminished whereas that of _PROTEIN_ was unaltered as compared with col . effects of estradiol treatment on the phenotype of wild type and xve _PROTEIN_ seedlings . all seedlings were vertically grown for days on _METHOD_ medium containing estradiol or ethanol . bar cm . the number of _PROTEIN_ roots was counted on col xve _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings grown for days on _METHOD_ medium containing estradiol or ethanol . averages of at least seedlings s.d . are shown . a statistical analysis was performed using student 's t test with significant differences indicated relative to col . gravitropic response of col xve _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedling roots . seedlings were grown vertically for days on _METHOD_ medium containing estradiol and then reoriented by and grown for days on the same medium . the deviation from a vertical line observed in the primary root growth was measured and assigned to one of twelve sectors in the circular _METHOD_ . the length of each bar represents the percentage of seedlings showing the same direction of root growth . over seedlings were evaluated for each genotype . aux/iaa proteins possess a potent transcriptional co repression activity through their domain i which contains an ear motif for interaction with the co repressor protein _PROTEIN_ . a recent interactome study revealed that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ which is one of five _PROTEIN_ proteins . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ also functions as a co repressor of transcriptional regulation for the auxin response as do the other aux/iaa proteins we examined the effects of _PROTEIN_ overexpression on the induction of early auxin responsive genes using xve _PROTEIN_ plants by semi quantitative rt pcr analysis . the early induction of three auxin responsive marker genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by indole acetic acid treatment in roots was suppressed in estradiol pretreated xve _PROTEIN_ plants especially in line which show drastic changes in root phenotypes as compared with the wild type . aux/iaa proteins generally possess a _LOCATION_ localization sequence and are localized to the _LOCATION_ . we used a polyethylene glycol mediated transient _PROTEIN_ system in arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts to determine the subcellular localization of _METHOD_ fusions of _PROTEIN_ which functions as a transcriptional repressor and also of the well characterized aux/iaa proteins arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . nls tdtomato a _LOCATION_ marker consisting of a fusion of simian virus large t antigen nls and red _METHOD_ protein tdtomato was co _PROTEIN_ with the _METHOD_ fusions in protoplasts . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized exclusively to the _LOCATION_ as previously reported whereas _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized to both the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ . _METHOD_ fusions of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were transiently _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts . nls tdtomato was co introduced both as a _LOCATION_ marker and as a control for transformation . _METHOD_ nls and bf represent _METHOD_ and tdtomato _METHOD_ and bright field images respectively . n _LOCATION_ c _LOCATION_ . bars . a key event in the transcriptional regulation of the auxin response is the degradation of aux/iaa proteins that have been ubiquitinated by _PROTEIN_ auxin receptors activated by direct binding to auxin . recently the auxin dependent protein protein interaction between _PROTEIN_ receptors and aux/iaa proteins has been assayed using a yeast two hybrid system . therefore we next performed a yeast two hybrid assay to examine the auxin dependent interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the well characterized aux/iaa proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were used as positive controls for this experiment . in yeast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interacted with _PROTEIN_ only on medium containing iaa as previously described for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . to examine a possible auxin dependent interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in planta we further conducted bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation assays using a transient _PROTEIN_ system in arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts as described above . the n terminal of _PROTEIN_ was fused to the n terminal half of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ to yield _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and the n terminal of _PROTEIN_ was fused to the c terminal half of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ to yield _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusions were used as positive controls and _METHOD_ gus was used as a negative control . in the negative control experiment using _METHOD_ gus and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ no _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed . similarly protoplasts _PROTEIN_ both _METHOD_ iaas and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ did not show any _METHOD_ signal in the absence of iaa . in contrast auxin treatment resulted in strong _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in protoplasts _PROTEIN_ all of the _METHOD_ aux/iaa fusions and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . this finding corroborated the auxin dependent interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as well as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in planta . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ resulting from the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and aux/iaa proteins in bifc assays was present only in the _LOCATION_ . yeast cells were co transformed with bait plasmid which contained a lexa dna binding domain _PROTEIN_ fusion _PROTEIN_ in and prey plasmid which contained activation domain aux/iaa fusions in . auxin dependent interactions in each transformant were assayed by plating on sd / ura/ his/ trp/ leu medium with iaa . auxin independent interactions were examined using the same medium without iaa . the bifc assay was used to detect protein protein interactions between aux/iaa repressors and _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ aux/iaa fusions or _METHOD_ gus and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were transiently co _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts with a _LOCATION_ marker plasmid nls tdtomato . to monitor the auxin dependent interaction iaa was added before microscopic observation . bifc nls and bf represent _METHOD_ tdtomato _METHOD_ and bright field images respectively . n _LOCATION_ . bars . the _PROTEIN_ of auxin responsive genes is directly controlled by the transcriptional activity of arf transcription _PROTEIN_ . five of the arf proteins present in arabidopsis function as transcriptional activators whereas the remaining eighteen act as repressors . at low auxin levels arf transcriptional activity is blocked by direct interaction with aux/iaa proteins . increased cellular levels of auxin result in the degradation of aux/iaa proteins that have been ubiquitinated via their interaction with _PROTEIN_ receptors and thereby promote arf transcriptional activity . the heterodimerization of aux/iaa and arf proteins occurs via an interaction between the conserved domains iii and iv on both proteins . to clarify whether _PROTEIN_ interacts specifically with arfs we carried out another series of yeast two hybrid and bifc analyses . the semi quantitative lacz activity assays used to measure the protein protein interaction levels in the yeast two hybrid system showed that _PROTEIN_ strongly interacted with the c terminal domain which contains domain iii and iv of the arf activators _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the lacz activity for _PROTEIN_ which does not contain domain iii and iv was almost the same as in the negative control experiment . on the other hand _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which are arf repressors that contain domain iii and iv directly interacted with _PROTEIN_ . however the level of this interaction was much lower than that of the arf activators . western blot analysis of ad arfctd proteins using anti ha antibody reveals that the _PROTEIN_ level of each arf protein in yeast does not affect the intensity of interaction with _PROTEIN_ . yeast cells were co transformed with bd _PROTEIN_ bait plasmid and ad arfctd prey plasmid as in . the strength of each interaction was evaluated by measuring gal activity using the o nitrophenyl d galactopyranoside method . vector indicates empty vector . a bifc assay was carried out to monitor the protein protein interaction between _PROTEIN_ and arfs . arf _METHOD_ fusions or _METHOD_ gus and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were transiently co _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts with a _LOCATION_ marker plasmid nls tdtomato . bifc nls and bf represent _METHOD_ tdtomato _METHOD_ and bright field images respectively . n _LOCATION_ . bars . to further analyze the in planta protein protein interaction between aux/iaa proteins and arfs we performed a bifc analysis by transiently _PROTEIN_ arf _METHOD_ fusions the c terminal fusion of arf with _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the c terminal fusion of _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ in arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts . the negative control experiment using _METHOD_ gus and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not result in any _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . as expected protoplasts _PROTEIN_ both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ also lacked _METHOD_ _METHOD_ because _PROTEIN_ lacks domain iii and iv . using all other arf _METHOD_ _METHOD_ combinations strong _METHOD_ _METHOD_ derived from specific physical protein protein interactions was observed only in the _LOCATION_ .
