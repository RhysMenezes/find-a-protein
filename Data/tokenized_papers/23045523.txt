xylan is made of a linear chain of linked xylosyl residues some of which are substituted with side chains such as _PROTEIN_ acid methylglucuronic acid and arabinose depending on the source of xylan . although past studies have revealed a number of genes involved in the elongation of the xylan backbone and the addition of glca and arabinosyl side chains no genes have been shown to be implicated in _PROTEIN_ methylation . in this report we investigated the roles of three arabidopsis genes namely _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in xylan biosynthesis . the _PROTEIN_ genes were found to be _PROTEIN_ in secondary wall forming cells and their _PROTEIN_ was regulated by _PROTEIN_ a secondary wall master transcriptional switch . their encoded proteins were shown to be located in the _LOCATION_ where xylan biosynthesis occurs . chemical analysis of cell wall sugars from single and double mutants of these genes revealed that although no alterations in the amount of xylose were observed a significant reduction in the level of meglca was evident in the _PROTEIN_ single mutant and the gxm double mutants . structural analysis of xylan demonstrated that the gxm mutations caused a specific defect in glca methylation on xylan without affecting the frequency of xylan substitution . only about of the glca residues on xylan were methylated in the _PROTEIN_ double mutant whereas in the wild type of the glca residues were methylated . furthermore an activity assay demonstrated that recombinant gxm proteins exhibited a methyltransferase activity capable of transferring the methyl group from s adenosylmethionine onto glca substituted xylooligomers and simultaneous mutations of _PROTEIN_ genes caused a loss of such a methyltransferase activity . taken together our results provide the first line of genetic and biochemical evidence that the three _PROTEIN_ domain containing proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are methyltransferases catalyzing o methylation of glca side chains on xylan .
the arabidopsis secondary wall master transcriptional switch _PROTEIN_ is capable of activating the secondary wall biosynthetic program when overexpressed indicating that _PROTEIN_ can be used as a tool to search for new genes involved in secondary wall biosynthesis . by analyzing those genes induced by _PROTEIN_ we have previously demonstrated the involvement of several _PROTEIN_ induced genes in xylan biosynthesis . in this study we focused on five additional _PROTEIN_ induced genes that encode _PROTEIN_ domain containing proteins namely _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . these five _PROTEIN_ induced genes belong to a _PROTEIN_ family that consists of a total of members suggesting that they may function redundantly in secondary wall biosynthesis and thus they were chosen for further studies . quantitative pcr analysis showed that the _PROTEIN_ of all these five genes was significantly induced by _PROTEIN_ overexpression . in contrast their _PROTEIN_ was drastically reduced in the _PROTEIN_ rna interference lines in which secondary wall _PROTEIN_ was completely inhibited in fibers . at the organ level all these five genes were predominantly _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ in which abundant secondary wall containing fibers and xylem cells are produced . at the tissue level all these five genes were found to be highly _PROTEIN_ in fibers and xylem cells that undergo secondary wall _PROTEIN_ but not in parenchymatous pith cells . one gxm close homolog was _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in flowers and its _PROTEIN_ was not regulated by _PROTEIN_ or associated with xylem and interfascicular fibers in _METHOD_ . thus the gene was not further analyzed for its function . the specific _PROTEIN_ of gxm genes in secondary wall forming cells was further confirmed by in situ hybridization . while the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes were previously shown to be involved in xylan biosynthesis the functions of the _PROTEIN_ genes are currently unknown therefore we investigated their roles in secondary wall biosynthesis . the finding that _METHOD_ are specifically _PROTEIN_ in secondary wall forming cells indicates their involvement in the biosynthesis of secondary wall components such as cellulose and xylan . since cellulose and xylan biosynthetic machineries are located in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ respectively we first examined which subcellular compartments gxm proteins are located in . sequence analysis of _METHOD_ using the program for prediction of transmembrane helices in proteins predicts that they are typical type ii _LOCATION_ proteins containing one transmembrane helix . subcellular localization studies using _METHOD_ protein tagging in carrot protoplasts revealed that the gxm proteins were co localized with _PROTEIN_ a family of _PROTEIN_ glycosyltransferase known to be located in the _LOCATION_ . the control protoplasts _PROTEIN_ yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ alone showed _METHOD_ signals throughout the cytoplasm . the _LOCATION_ localization of _METHOD_ indicate that they may be involved in the biosynthesis of xylan which is synthesized in the _LOCATION_ . to find out whether _METHOD_ play a role in xylan biosynthesis we obtained t dna insertion lines of the three gxm genes and further generated their double mutants for xylan analysis . sugar composition analysis of cell wall residues from _METHOD_ of these mutants showed no drastic reduction in xylose in the gxm mutants which is different from many known xylan deficient mutants in which the xylose content is significantly reduced . in contrast measurement of glca and meglca amounts in the total cell walls revealed that although the glca level was not significantly altered in the gxm mutants the meglca level was drastically reduced in the _PROTEIN_ single mutant and the three double gxm mutants . this phenotype is exactly opposite to that of many known xylan deficient mutants in which all glca side chains become methylated . since the gxm genes are specifically _PROTEIN_ in secondary wall forming cells this finding indicates that _METHOD_ are probaby involved in the methylation of glca side chains on xylan . to investigate whether gxm mutations indeed affect the methylation of glca side chains on xylan we isolated xylan from the gxm mutants for analysis of the meglca side chains . xylooligosaccharides were generated by digestion of the isolated xylan with xylanase and subsequently subjected to _PROTEIN_ assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . xylooligosaccharides generated from wild type xylan exhibited signal peaks corresponding to the glca substituted _PROTEIN_ and the meglca substituted _PROTEIN_ . in the wild type the meglca substituited _PROTEIN_ peak is predominant compared with the glca substituted _PROTEIN_ which is typical for wild type xylan . a significant reduction in the signal peak for the meglca substituted _PROTEIN_ was seen in the _PROTEIN_ single mutant and the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ double mutants . in particular in the _PROTEIN_ double mutant the glca substituited _PROTEIN_ peak became dominant and only a low level of the meglca substituited _PROTEIN_ signal peak remained . the other two single mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ double mutant also exhibited a reduction in the ratio of the meglca substituted _PROTEIN_ signal peak over that of the glca substituted _PROTEIN_ . these results demonstrated that the gxm mutations result in a defect in the methylation of glca side chains on xylan . to substantiate further the maldi tof _METHOD_ data the xylooligosaccharides generated by xylanase digestion of xylan from the wild type and the gxm mutants were analyzed by _LOCATION_ magnetic resonance spectroscopy . xylan from the wild type displayed resonances characteristic of of glca and meglca side chains at and p.p.m. respectively . it also exhibited resonances attributed to the backbone xylosyl residues and the xylan reducing end tetrasaccharide sequence d xyl l rha d gala d xyl . examination of xylan from the gxm mutants showed that the signal peaks for of meglca were reduced in all of the single and double mutants . the most significant reduction occurred in the _PROTEIN_ single mutant and the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ double mutants which is consistent with the maldi tof _METHOD_ data . the reduction in the level of meglca was also evident in the signal peaks for of meglca branched xyl and of meglca . integration analysis of the nmr spectra confirmed that in addition to the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutants and the _PROTEIN_ double mutant also had various degrees of reduction in the amount of meglca compared with the wild type . nmr analysis did not show a reduction in the amount of meglca in the _PROTEIN_ mutant as significant as that shown by chemical analysis of total cell walls . this discrepancy is most likely to be due to the _PROTEIN_ that pure xylooligomers were used for meglca detection in the nmr analysis whereas the chemical analysis detected the amount of meglca in total cell walls which may give rise to more variations . the _PROTEIN_ double mutant exhibited the highest reduction in the amount of meglca with only of the wild type level remaining . the gxm mutations apparently did not cause a _PROTEIN_ in the frequency of glca addition on xylan indicating that the methyl groups are transferred onto glca side chains after they are added onto xylan and a defect in methyl group transfer does not affect the glca substitution . together these results provide genetic evidence demonstrating that all three gxm genes are involved in the methylation of glca side chains on xylan . to substantiate further the role of _METHOD_ in the methylation of glca side chains on xylan we analyzed the _PROTEIN_ methyltransferase activity in the wild type and the single and double gxm mutants . putative cation dependent _PROTEIN_ methyltransferase activities were previously detected in particulate enzyme preparations from corn cobs and pea epicotyls . in these studies the particulate enzyme mixture was incubated with s adenosyl l methionine as a methyl donor without addition of an exogenous acceptor . it was found that the enzyme mixture was able to transfer the methyl group onto an endogenous macromolecular acceptor which was determined to be _PROTEIN_ . we first set out to assay the _PROTEIN_ methyltransferase activity in wild type arabidopsis stem microsomes using methyl radiolabeled s adenosyl l methionine as the methyl donor in the presence or absence of possible acceptors . it was found that no methyltransferase activity was detected in wild type microsomes when no exogenous acceptor was added or when glca udp glca or _PROTEIN_ were used as acceptors . in contrast a high level of methyltransferase activity was found when glca substituted _PROTEIN_ isolated from the _PROTEIN_ double mutant was used as an acceptor demonstrating that wild type arabidopsis microsomes possess a _PROTEIN_ methyltransferase activity that is capable of catalyzing the transfer of the methyl group from the s adenosyl l methionine donor onto the glca substituted xyloligomer acceptor . examination of the _PROTEIN_ methyltransferase activity in the gxm mutants revealed a significant loss of the activity in the _PROTEIN_ single mutant and the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ double mutants compared with the wild type . in particular the _PROTEIN_ methyltransferase activity was very low in the _PROTEIN_ double mutant . these results are consistent with the chemical analysis data of the xylan structure in the gxm mutants and indicate that _METHOD_ are methyltransferases that catalyze the transfer of the methyl group onto glca side chains on xylan . to validate that _METHOD_ are _PROTEIN_ methyltransferases we generated and purified gxm recombinant proteins fused with maltose binding protein from escherichia coli and used them for an activity assay . purified fusion proteins of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fused with mbp had the expected molecular weights of and kda respectively . gxm fusion proteins were assayed for methyltransferase activity using methyl radiolabeled s adenosyl l methionine as a methyl donor and glca substituted _PROTEIN_ isolated from the _PROTEIN_ double mutant or _PROTEIN_ as an acceptor . it was found that the recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ exhibited a high level of methyltransferase activity that was able to transfer the radiolabeled methyl group onto the glca substituted _PROTEIN_ acceptor but not unsubstituted _PROTEIN_ . the control reactions using the mbp alone showed no such methyltransferase activity . the gxm catalyzed reaction products were further analyzed by nmr spectroscopy revealing a significant elevation of signals in the peaks corresponding to o methylated glca . integration analysis showed that while the glca substituted xylooligomer acceptor used for methyltransferase activity assay had only of glca methylated the degree of methylated glca in the glca substituted xylooligomer acceptor was increased to and respectively after incubation with the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ recombinant proteins . it appeared that all three _METHOD_ exhibited a similar level of methyltransferase activities which is probably attributed to the large amount of recombinant proteins used for the activity assay . these results unequivocally demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ methyltransferases catalyzing o methylation of glca . the gxm single and double mutant plants grew at a normal rate like the wild type and the mechanical strength of their _METHOD_ was not significantly altered compared with that of the wild type except for the _PROTEIN_ double mutant in which a population of plants showed reduced stem mechanical strength . examination of interfascicular fibers in _METHOD_ did not reveal a significant alteration in secondary wall _PROTEIN_ . these results indicate that a reduction in the degree of methylation on _PROTEIN_ has no observable impact on plant growth or the total cell wall deposition . mutations of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which encode _PROTEIN_ domain containing proteins were previously shown to cause a reduction in xylan xylosyltransferase activity and an increase in wall digestibility by cellulase . we therefore decided to investigate whether the gxm mutations have any effect on xylan xylosyltransferase activity and wall digestibility . an assay of xylan xylosyltransferase using stem microsomes and the exogenous acceptor showed no significant alterations in the xylosyltransferase activity in the gxm mutants compared with the wild type although a slight change in the xylosyltransferase activity was observed in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutants and the gxm double mutants . a wall digestibility test demonstrated that the cellulose digestion efficiency by cellulase and cellobiase was similar between the wild type and the gxm mutant plants indicating that an alteration in the degree of glca methylation on xylan has no effect on the accessibility and digestibility of cellulose by cellulases .
