cle peptides named for the _PROTEIN_ related peptide family participate in intercellular signaling pathways . here we investigated members of the cle like gene family that encode peptide precursors recently designated as root growth _PROTEIN_ . clel precursors share a similar domain structure with cle precursors . our evidence shows that unlike root growth _PROTEIN_ clel peptides are unmodified and function in the regulation of the direction of root growth and _PROTEIN_ root development . overexpression of several clel genes in arabidopsis resulted in either long roots or long and wavy roots that also showed altered _PROTEIN_ root patterning . exogenous application of unmodified synthetic amino acid peptides derived from two clel motifs resulted in similar phenotypic changes in roots of wild type plants . in clel peptide induced long roots the root apical meristem was enlarged and consisted of an increased number of cells compared with wild type root apical _METHOD_ . the wavy root phenotype appeared to be independent of other responses of the roots to the environment . results also showed that the inhibition of _PROTEIN_ initiation by clel overexpression was not overcome by the application of auxin . these findings establish clel as a peptide family with previously unrecognized regulatory functions controlling the pattern of root growth and _PROTEIN_ root development in plants .
fig ref highlights the unique sequence domain of _PROTEIN_ in comparing the complete sequences of several cle precursors . the cle motif is located in the variable region of the _PROTEIN_ residues to than in the c terminus as is typical for other members of the family . furthermore strabala et al . reported that overexpressing the full length _PROTEIN_ caused long roots in arabidopsis whereas ito et al . showed that exogenous application of the synthetic aa peptide derived from the _PROTEIN_ variable region motif triggered a short root phenotype . these seemingly contradictory results suggested that the synthetic _PROTEIN_ peptide does not represent the native active form of the _PROTEIN_ peptide . in other words either different functional domains in the _PROTEIN_ precursor or posttranslational modification of the peptide determines the functionality of the endogenous protein . to further dissect its function we overexpressed the full length _PROTEIN_ gene . we observed that indeed overexpressing _PROTEIN_ caused long roots _PROTEIN_ consistent with the results reported by strabala et al . . in addition roots from these plants showed an enhanced wavy or irregular pattern of growth direction compared with roots from wild type plants . it is known that certain growth conditions can cause the wavy root phenotype in wild type plants a result of a thigmotropic response . one typical assay for this process is to grow the plants on firm agar with a inclination of the growth surface . in this way we could determine whether the wavy growth pattern elicited by overexpressing _PROTEIN_ is related to thigmotropism . as a control both the wild type and _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants were grown vertically on soft agar plates for d _PROTEIN_ . for thigmotropic testing the plants were vertically grown on firm agar plates for d and then on plates inclined for another d _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants showed more wavy roots than did wild type under both conditions . the wavy root phenotype triggered by overexpressing _PROTEIN_ therefore appeared to be independent of thigmotropism . to test the possibility that other domains of the _PROTEIN_ precursor functioned differently from the cle motif previously defined in the variable domain we examined the _PROTEIN_ sequence further . our analysis revealed a aa sequence from residues to in the c terminus that appeared to share similar features with cle peptides . we reasoned that this motif might be responsible for the long and wavy root phenotype effected by overexpressing the full length _PROTEIN_ . to test this possibility we added the unmodified synthetic aa _PROTEIN_ c terminal peptide to the culture medium . we observed the induction of long and wavy roots suggesting that the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ contains a previously undetected motif that functions as a unique regulatory peptide . it has been shown that cle gene products function as or aa peptide hormones . both the aa proline hydroxylated _PROTEIN_ and the aa proline hydroxylated _PROTEIN_ glycopeptides have been detected in plants overexpressing the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes respectively . accordingly we determined whether a aa peptide in the _PROTEIN_ c terminus functions as well as the aa peptide tested earlier . the results indicated that the aa c terminal peptide of _PROTEIN_ elicited root growth effects similar to the aa peptide . on the basis of these results we suspected that the to aa c terminal motif of _PROTEIN_ represents a family of peptides that function in cell signaling processes . by homology search using this aa motif as a query sequence we identified a family of proteins including _PROTEIN_ . these peptides were conserved only at the c terminal aa motif and each contained an n terminal hydrophobic patch that potentially served as a signal peptide for targeting to the secretory pathway . since this gene family was derived from _PROTEIN_ and since the precursor proteins of its members shared a similar domain structure with cles we designated members of this gene family as cle like genes and the conserved c terminal aa sequence as the clel motif and the gene products as clel peptides . except for _PROTEIN_ the clel genes were numbered from to according to the order of their locus numbers in the arabidopsis information resource . of the clel proteins in arabidopsis and share the greatest pairwise amino acid sequence identity at and the genes are located adjacent to each other on the same chromosome implying that they are derived from a gene duplication event . the clel motif of appears to contain amino acids with a amino acid insert . as mentioned above the peptides under consideration were previously named root growth _PROTEIN_ we suggest that a change in nomenclature is justified on several grounds . first the original name implies that the peptides are confined to roots . on the basis of current information members of the clel family occur not only in roots but also throughout the plant . for example _PROTEIN_ is especially abundant in stamens and _PROTEIN_ . the rgf nomenclature gives no information on the nature of the genes . by contrast the clel designation relates these genes to the well known cles one of which _PROTEIN_ is the founding member of the clel family . the subcellular localization of three clel _PROTEIN_ and determined using the _METHOD_ fusion system . the results showed that all three clel _METHOD_ fusion proteins _METHOD_ were located in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ suggesting targeting to the secretory pathway . the results are further consistent with the presence of an n terminal signal peptide sequence in the clel proteins . this analysis suggested that clel members like the cle peptides are secreted into the _LOCATION_ space via a default pathway following cleavage of their signal peptide in the _LOCATION_ . it is worth noting that due to potential proteolytic cleavage during maturation all clel peptide fusion protein assays including the _METHOD_ fusions described here should be interpreted with caution . because of this complexity _METHOD_ distribution may indicate only the subcellular localizations of clel precursors not the mature peptides that may have been separated from the _METHOD_ tag after cleavage . nevertheless the results demonstrate that clel precursors can enter the secretary pathway and that the _METHOD_ reporter may indicate the location where the processing of clel proteins takes place . to explore the function of the gene family we overexpressed several clel genes individually in arabidopsis . the results showed that overexpression of the full length clel genes elicited either long and wavy roots _PROTEIN_ or long roots exclusively . we also sought to determine whether the wavy growth pattern elicited by overexpressing and _PROTEIN_ is related to thigmotropism . to this end wild type and clel overexpressing plants were grown vertically on soft agar plates for d or on firm agar plates first vertically for d and then inclined for d . again the clel overexpressing plants showed more wavy roots compared with wild type under both conditions . we also tested the growth pattern of these plants under light and darkness and observed that the clel overexpressing plants formed more wavy roots under both conditions . the results thus indicate that the wavy phenotype elicited by clel overexpression is not affected by either thigmotropism or phototropism . the results on clel enhancement of root growth in our study are in general agreement with the reports of strabala et al . for _PROTEIN_ and of matsuzaki et al . for rgf peptides . however the wavy root and altered _PROTEIN_ root pattern phenotypes described below have not been previously observed . they add another dimension to providing evidence that clel peptides play diverse roles in the growth and development of plant roots . to determine whether peptides derived from the clel motif of clel proteins are able to function as regulators we synthesized three aa unmodified peptides derived from the corresponding clel motifs of each of the and precursors and applied of each individually in vitro . the results indicated that the _PROTEIN_ and peptides triggered long and wavy roots . moreover the wavy root phenotypes elicited by the unmodified synthetic clel peptides were independent of thigmotropic or phototropic responses as described above for plants overexpressing the peptides . the phenotype resulting from treatment with one of the peptides was similar to that of plants overexpressing the protein . thus the peptide appeared to recapitulate the long and wavy root phenotypes triggered by overexpression of the full length gene . in addition arabidopsis mutants with an impaired gravitropic response such as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ responded to the peptides by forming long and wavy roots again suggesting that these phenotypes are not dependent on gravitropism . on the other hand in contrast to the long root phenotype triggered by overexpression of the full length gene the aa peptide failed to affect root growth significantly . it is intriguing to observe such a contrast among different clel peptides . in light of the results of matsuzaki et al . we envisaged that has to be modified by a posttranslational process such as sulfation to become active . by contrast may not require modification . the observation that promotes longer roots when overexpressed is consistent with the conclusion of matsuzaki that peptides require sulfation to complement the short root phenotype as seen in the _PROTEIN_ mutant lacking _PROTEIN_ . in contrast the previously unreported wavy root phenotype caused by appears to represent a function mediated by unmodified peptides . in other words in planta there may be two functional _METHOD_ of clel peptides a sulfated form and an unmodified form . the size of the ram is an important parameter in root growth and development . to further dissect the long root phenotype elicited by a clel peptide in vivo and in vitro we measured ram length in primary roots of d old seedlings . the results indicated that the long roots observed in plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ contained a significantly longer ram than did wild type plants . similar results were observed with the long roots elicited by exogenous application of unmodified synthetic clel peptides . the number and length of cells in the ram determine its size . to further pinpoint the process whereby clels function we counted the number and calculated the length of cortical cells in the ram . the results showed a strong positive correlation between ram length and the number of cortical cells in the ram . in other words the elongated _METHOD_ contain significantly more cortical cells than the control . no significant increase in cell length was observed in the longer ram brought about by clel peptides . the results prompt the conclusion that the prolonged ram results _PROTEIN_ from an increase in ram cell number . next we monitored the cell division rate in the ram using a cell division marker line that contains the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct . we found that the exogenous application of the peptide which caused a longer ram did not significantly increase the number of dividing cells . however appeared to alter the distribution of dividing cells in the ram . on the control medium cell division in the roots took place in a small niche near _PROTEIN_ . with treatment dividing cells were distributed in a much larger region in the ram . in addition to the above observations we found that overexpression of or _PROTEIN_ dramatically delayed _PROTEIN_ root development in arabidopsis . in contrast to the d old wild type plants that displayed a well developed _PROTEIN_ root system plants overexpressing or _PROTEIN_ had almost no _PROTEIN_ roots . although the _METHOD_ that regulate the distribution and arrangement of _PROTEIN_ roots along the parental root remain largely unknown auxin has been shown to play a critical role . _PROTEIN_ roots in arabidopsis are derived from pericycle founder cells positioned adjacent to the two protoxylem poles . auxin accumulates at the site of _PROTEIN_ root initiation before a primordium starts to form . some auxin related mutants show impaired _PROTEIN_ root development and in general exogenous application of auxin induces cell division and results in _PROTEIN_ root initiation in the entire pericycle at the xylem poles in wild type plants . it is thus proposed that the distribution pattern of _PROTEIN_ roots may be regulated by an auxin based oscillatory mechanism . to determine whether auxin could be responsible for the effect of clel on the formation of _PROTEIN_ roots the d old transgenic and the wild type plants grown on the _METHOD_ medium were transferred to the same medium containing or nm iaa . although iaa containing media promoted _PROTEIN_ root formation in wild type plants such treatments failed to rescue _PROTEIN_ root development in plants overexpressing or _PROTEIN_ . the results further showed that iaa treatment inhibited root elongation in both wild type and clel overexpressing plants indicating that root growth of all plants responded to iaa . taken together the results suggest that clel peptides regulate _PROTEIN_ root development through an auxin independent pathway . at stage i of _PROTEIN_ root initiation the two adjacent pericycle founder cells undergo two successive rounds of anticlinal asymmetric cell divisions producing a center of four small cells and two larger flanking cells . thereafter anticlinal cell division halts and the two cells in the center of four small cells divide periclinally to produce two layers of cell files at stage ii of the _PROTEIN_ root initiation . compared with _PROTEIN_ root initiation in wild type roots the anticlinal division of pericycle cells was strikingly irregular in roots overexpressing or _PROTEIN_ . here the pericycle cells appeared to divide both asymmetrically and symmetrically and to lack the formation of the central core of small pericycle cells at stage i . among the seedlings examined for each group of plants the wild type had central cores of pericycle cells at stage i whereas the and _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines had only and respectively . on the other hand the pericycle cells dividing abnormally at stage i appeared to reach stage ii but no further development was observed . the results suggest that clel peptides disturb the restrictive division of pericycle cells involved in _PROTEIN_ root initiation . an exciting question concerns how clel peptides act in the development of _PROTEIN_ roots . here it is worth noting that a receptor like kinase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was shown to function in specifying the fate of pericycle cells during _PROTEIN_ root initiation . _PROTEIN_ appears to be critical for repressing the division of nearby pericycle cells and in this way controls the patterning of _PROTEIN_ roots . _PROTEIN_ was also reported to regulate stem cell fate in the ram via the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ signaling loop . because lrr _PROTEIN_ for example _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ serve as receptors for cle peptides it _METHOD_ possible that clel peptides may interact with unknown receptor like kinase to initiate signaling cascades that regulate asymmetric division of pericycle cells and thus _PROTEIN_ root initiation .
