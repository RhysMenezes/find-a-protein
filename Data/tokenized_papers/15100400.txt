arabidopsis thaliana has eight genes encoding members of the type heavy metal transporting subfamily of the p type _PROTEIN_ . three of these transporters _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are closely related to each other and are most similar in sequence to the divalent heavy metal cation transporters of prokaryotes . to determine the function of these transporters in metal homeostasis we have identified and characterized mutants affected in each . whereas the individual mutants exhibited no apparent phenotype _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants had a nutritional deficiency phenotype that could be compensated for by increasing the level of zn but not cu or co in the growth medium . levels of zn but not other essential elements in the shoot tissues of a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant and to a lesser extent of a _PROTEIN_ single mutant were _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type . together these observations indicate a primary role for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in essential zn homeostasis . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ reporter gene constructs provide evidence that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is predominantly in the vascular tissues of roots _METHOD_ and leaves . in addition _PROTEIN_ of the genes in developing anthers was confirmed by rt pcr and was consistent with a male sterile phenotype in the double mutant . _PROTEIN_ appears to be localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as indicated by protein gel blot analysis of _LOCATION_ fractions using isoform specific antibodies and by the visualization of an _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein fusion by confocal microscopy . these observations are consistent with a role for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in zn translocation . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations both conferred increased sensitivity to cd in a phytochelatin deficient mutant background suggesting that they may also influence cd detoxification .
to investigate the function of the three closely related type p type _PROTEIN_ genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we have identified two independent mutant alleles for each gene . using a reverse genetic approach we identified t dna insertion alleles in the wassilewskija ecotype . five mutant alleles _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were identified for the three genes . backcrosses to the wild type ws indicated that the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines contained a single t dna locus segregating in a mendelian ratio . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines each contained the hma mutation and a second independently assorting t dna insertion . lines containing only the hma insertion were identified after backcrosses to ws . we have also obtained hma t dna insertion lines in the columbia ecotype from the salk collection referred to here as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in backcrosses to the wild type these mutants segregated for a single t dna . the positions of the t dna left border insertion sites are shown in figure and table . rt pcr on total rna prepared from wild type and mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants was performed using hma gene specific primers that flanked the t dna insertion point . for each mutant the gene specific rt pcr product corresponding to the mutated gene was absent whereas a product was obtained for the two wild type hma genes in each mutant and for all three genes in the wild type ws control . hma mutant alleles identified in this study comparisons of database sequences of the _PROTEIN_ gene from the col and ws ecotypes also indicated that the _PROTEIN_ gene in col contains a single base pair deletion that would result in a frame shift and subsequent truncation of the predicted gene product after amino acid . the truncated product would lack the conserved _PROTEIN_ binding site and is presumably nonfunctional . we have confirmed this polymorphism from both cdna and genomic dna in the col and ws ecotypes . for the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants in the ws background described below we assume that _PROTEIN_ is functional whereas in the col background the presence of the naturally occurring _PROTEIN_ allele results in a triple mutant line . when grown in soil none of the individual hma mutants exhibited an apparent phenotype in comparison with the wild type . this may be because of the transporters encoded by these genes having at least partially redundant functions in planta . much of the arabidopsis genome has been duplicated through evolution and there are examples where both members of a pair of genes must be mutated to observe a phenotype thereby indicating overlapping functions . to investigate this possibility double mutant lines were constructed . the hma mutants were crossed and the progeny were grown and allowed to self fertilize . the genotypes of individuals were scored by pcr for the absence of the wild type alleles and then the presence of the gene specific t dna insertions . in crosses between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants a small proportion of individuals had a chlorotic stunted phenotype . in a cross segregating for both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ individuals with the mutant phenotype were identified in plants and all were homozygous for both mutations when genotyped by pcr . similarly in a cross between the independent salk mutant lines _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the col ecotype of individuals exhibited the same phenotype and were identified as homozygous double mutants . a total of individuals with a wild type phenotype were also tested and all contained a wild type allele for one or both genes . together this demonstrates that the mutant phenotype results from homozygous mutations at both the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ loci . because the double mutants failed to grow and set seed individuals were identified that were homozygous for the _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion but heterozygous for _PROTEIN_ . progeny from these were grown in pots and segregated chlorotic stunted individuals as expected . these individuals were shown to be homozygous double mutants . by contrast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant lines were indistinguishable from the wild type . for this reason the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutants and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant are the focus of the remainder of this study . the phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant is shown in figure . during the early stages of development the plants were smaller and chlorotic and often appeared to have necrotic patches in the leaves . most individuals eventually produced multiple short floral stalks that formed buds but then appeared to abort resulting in increasingly bushy plants . in some individuals the floral stalks extended and developed inflorescences . these inflorescences were more compact than in the wild type because of shortened internodes . floral buds and floral organs developed normally although the anthers produced no pollen and the flowers were sterile . the siliques of the double mutant contained no developing embryos and did not elongate and mature as in the wild type . when mature flowers were cross pollinated with pollen from a wild type plant a few embryos formed in each silique but failed to develop into viable seed . this suggests that in addition to the absence of pollen there is either a defect in ovule development or possibly a failure of fertilized embryos to develop in a homozygous mutant background . the hma transporters are most similar to the divalent heavy metal cation subclass of type p type _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ confers increased resistance to zn or cd in e. coli or yeast . thus we hypothesized that the growth deficiency of the double mutant resulted from zn deficiency . to investigate this progeny of a plant homozygous for _PROTEIN_ and heterozygous for _PROTEIN_ were planted in pots treated with a single application of standard mineral salts medium . after d stunted chlorotic individuals could be identified and those with a wild type phenotype were removed . the pots were then subirrigated at to d intervals with either water alone or water containing or mm . where and mm zn solution was applied growth was increased although variable . however all plants in the pots supplemented with or mm zn were rescued with vegetative growth and seed set similar to the wild type . pcr analysis confirmed that the rescued plants were double homozygous mutants . identical results were obtained for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants . together this demonstrates that the growth defect of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants results from an extreme zn deficiency that can be rescued by the application of excess zn to the soil . application of co or cu to soil was unable to rescue the phenotype . the capacity of exogenous zn application to rescue the growth and fertility of the double mutant allowed it to be _PROTEIN_ as a homozygous double mutant line . subsequent experiments were performed on seed obtained from homozygous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ individuals . a similar zn dependent phenotype was observed for plants grown in agar medium . in this case the double mutant was indistinguishable from the wild type when grown on mineral salts medium containing zn . however omitting the zn from the medium resulted in a similar chlorotic phenotype for the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant but had no effect on the wild type or the single mutants . the mutant phenotype could not be rescued by the addition of cu to the medium . to measure the apparent zn deficiency _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutants the double mutant and wild type plants were grown on mineral salts agar medium from which zn had been omitted or to which zn was added . the levels of zn accumulated in shoot tissue were measured after d . in medium to which zn was not added the zn content of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutants did not differ significantly from the wild type whereas in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant zn levels were approximately twofold less than in the wild type and were below the threshold of ppm believed to be required for normal growth . in the presence of zn the levels of zn in all lines increased . the _PROTEIN_ mutant was indistinguishable from the wild type whereas the _PROTEIN_ mutant and the double mutant accumulated approximately twofold and fourfold less zn respectively than the wild type . in these same plants cu levels were not _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type and levels of mg mn ca and fe were not significantly different from the wild type suggesting that the phenotype is attributable to zn deficiency . wild type and double mutant plants were also grown in soil with and without supplementation with mm zn . levels of zn in rosettes of the double mutant were twofold to threefold lower than in the wild type both with and without zn supplementation . plants grown in soil supplemented with mm zn were allowed to bolt and _METHOD_ and inflorescences were harvested and measured for zn content . under these conditions growth of the double mutant was indistinguishable from the wild type . again in the double mutant levels of zn were threefold to fourfold lower than the wild type . zn accumulation in roots was also examined in wild type and double mutant plants grown in hydroponic conditions in medium from which zn had been omitted . in these plants the rosettes of the double mutant exhibited the characteristic zn deficiency phenotype and accumulated approximately twofold less zn than the wild type as expected . by contrast zn accumulation in roots was approximately twofold higher in the double mutant indicating that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are not involved in zn uptake into roots . to visualize the cellular pattern of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in planta promoter _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion constructs were _PROTEIN_ in transgenic col plants . for both constructs gus _PROTEIN_ was predominantly observed in the vascular tissue of roots leaves and _METHOD_ . in a section of stem _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gus gus activity was observed in vascular bundles and appeared to be _PROTEIN_ in components of both the xylem and the phloem . in inflorescences the _PROTEIN_ of both constructs occurred in parallel and changed during floral development . in unopened flowers gus activity was observed in immature anthers where it was largely confined to the tapetum . gus staining of pollen grains within the anthers was observed in unopened flowers although mature pollen did not show gus activity . in opened flowers and senescent flowers gus activity was _PROTEIN_ within the vascular tissue of mature anther filaments and at the base of the developing silique . the _PROTEIN_ qualitative difference in _PROTEIN_ of the two constructs was that _PROTEIN_ gus but not _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ was observed in the vascular tissue of mature siliques . to confirm that the _PROTEIN_ of the promoter gus constructs in anthers reflected the _PROTEIN_ of the endogenous genes we measured _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ directly by rt pcr . _PROTEIN_ in immature anthers excised from the filaments of unopened stage flowers was compared with _PROTEIN_ in the dehiscing anthers and filaments separately of mature opened flowers . higher levels of both rt pcr products were detected in immature anthers compared with mature anthers . quantitation relative to the actin control revealed a to fold difference in _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in mature filaments was also detected by rt pcr . the pattern of _PROTEIN_ in anthers observed using rt pcr reflected that in the promoter gus transgenic plants . two different approaches were used to identify the subcellular location of _PROTEIN_ . first total _LOCATION_ from plants were fractionated by aqueous two phase partitioning and the fractions were characterized by protein gel blot analysis probed with _PROTEIN_ specific antibodies . the specificity of the antibodies was confirmed by probing protein gel blots of microsomal proteins extracted from wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . aqueous two phase partitioning preferentially partitions _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ into the upper phase and the other _LOCATION_ including _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ chloroplast _LOCATION_ and tonoplast into the lower phase . figure shows that _PROTEIN_ is enriched in the upper phase as was a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ h _PROTEIN_ marker _PROTEIN_ . controls indicated that endomembranes were enriched in the lower phase as shown using antibodies that recognized an _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ located _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the tonoplast located . to corroborate the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization _PROTEIN_ was fused in frame with a green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ under the control of the promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus in transgenic plants . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was confirmed to be enriched in upper phase _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fractions by protein gel blots probed with _METHOD_ specific antibody and _PROTEIN_ specific antibody . the subcellular location of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein in root tip cells was visualized by confocal microscopy . the pattern of _METHOD_ is consistent with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ location indicated by _LOCATION_ fractionation . in a control _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein alone _METHOD_ was observed within the _LOCATION_ and throughout the cytoplasm consistent with a previous report . the single hma mutants were tested for altered sensitivity to zn cd and co in agar medium and no distinct phenotype was observed . because _PROTEIN_ is able to confer increased cd resistance when _PROTEIN_ in yeast we wished to investigate a possible role for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in cd resistance . in arabidopsis the major determinant of cd detoxification is the phytochelatins and _PROTEIN_ pc synthase deficient mutants lacking detectable pcs show an approximately fold increase in cd sensitivity . thus it was possible that a slight effect on cd sensitivity mediated by the hma mutations may have been masked by the presence of pcs . to test this _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants were crossed with the _PROTEIN_ mutant . among populations individuals that exhibited the extreme cd sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ homozygotes were observed at a frequency of and were subsequently screened by pcr to identify those homozygous for the hma t dna insertion . progeny from these hma _PROTEIN_ double mutant lines were then tested for sensitivity to cd . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants exhibited approximately twofold increased sensitivity to cd compared with the _PROTEIN_ mutant alone . in the presence of cd growth of all three strains was inhibited to some extent but inhibition of the hma _PROTEIN_ lines was significantly greater than for the _PROTEIN_ mutant alone . in the presence of cd only the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ line was inhibited compared with _PROTEIN_ and in the presence of cd all three lines were equally inhibited .
