in plants one bona fide subunit has been identified as well as a single and two subunits . to study the roles of lipidation motifs in the regulation of subcellular location and heterotrimer formation in living plant cells _METHOD_ tagged versions of the arabidopsis thaliana heterotrimeric g protein subunits were constructed . mutational analysis showed that the arabidopsis subunit contains two lipidation motifs that were essential for _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization . the arabidopsis subunit _PROTEIN_ and the subunit _PROTEIN_ were dependent upon each other for tethering to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the second subunit _PROTEIN_ did not require _PROTEIN_ for localization to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . like _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ contains two putative lipidation motifs both of which were necessary for _LOCATION_ localization . interaction between the subunits was studied using _METHOD_ resonance energy transfer imaging by means of _METHOD_ lifetime imaging microscopy . the results suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ can form heterodimers independent of lipidation . in addition flim fret revealed the existence of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ heterotrimers at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . importantly rendering constitutively active did not cause a fret _PROTEIN_ in the heterotrimer suggesting no dissociation upon activation .
in order to determine the subcellular location of plant heterotrimeric g proteins _METHOD_ protein tagged versions of these proteins were prepared . since n and c terminal fusions of mammalian subunits were found to be non functional yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ was inserted into the arabidopsis subunit . the insertion site was based on the paper by chen et al . in which they describe a _METHOD_ fusion protein that accumulates at the nascent cell plate in dividing arabidopsis cells . recently this fusion protein was used to study the interaction of with the _LOCATION_ protein _LOCATION_ formation in arabidopsis roots . bunemann et al . used a similar insertion site in the loop of the helical domain to obtain a functional mammalian _METHOD_ tagged . fig . shows that _METHOD_ was enriched in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of living cowpea mesophyll protoplasts . by contrast unfused _METHOD_ was found in the _LOCATION_ and in the _LOCATION_ which appears as strands crossing the cell and surrounding the large _LOCATION_ . the n terminus of contains the classical myristoylation consensus sequence mgxxxs that is conserved among subunits in dicots and monocots and can be recognized by nmt . this enzyme catalyzes the transfer of myristoyl from coa to the primary amino group of glycine . myristoylation most often occurs co translationally after removal of the initiating methionine by methionine aminopeptidase . a closer look at the amino acid sequence _PROTEIN_ hints at a second possible lipid modification the cysteine at position might be a target for palmitoylation which involves the attachment of palmitic acid . in order to investigate possible lipidation of _PROTEIN_ and the mutants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were analyzed . fig . c shows the distribution of the two mutants in cowpea protoplasts which was strikingly different from the distribution of wild type . interestingly the location of _METHOD_ was comparable to that of unfused _METHOD_ and the double mutant _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ indicating cytoplasmic localization . next the difference in diffusion between the wild type protein the two single point mutated proteins and the double mutant was investigated by means of _METHOD_ recovery after photobleaching . upon photobleaching of unfused _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ we observed a very fast _METHOD_ recovery which is typical of fast diffusing cytoplasmic proteins . however _METHOD_ diffused significantly slower . the diffusion data thus confirm the localization data showing that only _METHOD_ was able to bind to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the arabidopsis subunit _PROTEIN_ and the arabidopsis subunits _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were fused to the c terminus of spectral variants of _METHOD_ . the two subunits _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ both showed a diffuse distribution in the cytoplasm . the other subunit _PROTEIN_ was predominantly located at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . occasionally _LOCATION_ like structures were observed in the cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ these structures were more abundant . in order to examine the nature of these structures _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was co transfected with the _LOCATION_ marker sialyltransferase fused to red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . when the _METHOD_ signal was merged with the _METHOD_ signal the resultant image showed several bright yellow spots indicative of a significant co localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . next the effect of _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ on the distribution of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was studied . co _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ showed _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ targeting of both proteins . _PROTEIN_ was equally effective in targeting _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . during co _PROTEIN_ studies of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we observed improved _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . therefore the number of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells was quantified in the presence and absence of _PROTEIN_ . we observed an approximate twofold increase in the number of cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ upon co _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ as compared to cells _PROTEIN_ only _PROTEIN_ . in order to investigate the role that c terminal sequences play in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ targeting the _PROTEIN_ subunit was mutated by introducing five additional amino acid residues behind its caax box thereby rendering the protein unrecognizable for prenylation enzymes . this mutation _PROTEIN_ caused the _PROTEIN_ protein to become _LOCATION_ . we also mutated the putative palmitoylation site in _PROTEIN_ at residue and observed a loss in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ affinity . the prenylation as well as the palmitoylation motif of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ appeared to be necessary for _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ targeting of the heterodimer as _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were found in the _LOCATION_ together with _PROTEIN_ . these observations implicate a direct interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . therefore we analyzed interactions between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ resonance energy transfer microscopy . fret is a quantum mechanical phenomenon that can be used to measure distances or changes in distance between two _METHOD_ tagged molecules . fret can occur at distances < and is characterized by a _PROTEIN_ in the _METHOD_ intensity and _METHOD_ lifetime of the donor fluorophore . several techniques are available to measure fret . initial experiments using acceptor photobleaching showed an increase in donor _METHOD_ upon bleaching of the acceptor suggestive of fret . since flim _METHOD_ is more suitable for live cell experiments this technique was used to study in detail the existence of a direct interaction between plant and subunits . in frequency domain flim the sample is excited with sinusoidally modulated light . as a consequence the emitted _METHOD_ is also sinusoidally modulated at the same frequency but displays a shift in phase and a reduction in modulation depth from which a phase lifetime and a modulation lifetime can be measured respectively . a reduction in lifetime of both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was observed upon co _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ which demonstrates the occurrence of fret and is indicative of the formation of a heterodimer . lifetime data were also obtained for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ together with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and again a _PROTEIN_ in lifetime was observed indicating that _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ . this suggests that in plants dimerization is independent of the lipidation motif of the plant subunit _PROTEIN_ . we studied heterotrimer formation in living plant cells with flim fret using _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in cowpea protoplasts _PROTEIN_ together with unfused _PROTEIN_ in order to assure _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ distribution of the subunit . the lifetime of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ upon _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ suggestive of the formation of a heterotrimer . mutation of the glutamine that is present in the switch ii of mammalian subunits and small g proteins renders them constitutively active since they are no longer able to hydrolyze bound _PROTEIN_ molecules and hence are present in the active _PROTEIN_ bound state . remarkably application of this mutation in did not change the subcellular location of _METHOD_ as compared to _METHOD_ and frap analysis reported similar mobility characteristics whereas has been shown to change the phenotype in whole plants . it is even more remarkable that incorporation of the mutation did not abolish fret to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ since the lifetime of _METHOD_ upon _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was efficiently quenched . these above observations suggest that subunits containing this mutation still reside in the _LOCATION_ as a heterotrimer with . fig . in supplementary material shows the distribution of the phase lifetimes plotted against the modulation lifetimes obtained for the various combinations . a clear reduction of both phase lifetime and modulation lifetime is observed as compared to the control situation . this results in two significantly different distributions which is indicative of fret . to ensure that the fret observed in the heterotrimer was not due to surface concentration effects we performed a competition assay . for this we studied the effect of co _PROTEIN_ of unfused _PROTEIN_ on the fret efficiency between and . if the interactions that were described here are specific the unfused _PROTEIN_ subunit should be able to compete with the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ version thereby reducing fret and increasing the lifetime of _METHOD_ towards the values observed for the controls . indeed table shows that unfused _PROTEIN_ increased the lifetime values of both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . this demonstrates that fret between _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is specific and not due to surface concentration . because co _PROTEIN_ of unfused _PROTEIN_ increased the lifetime of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ with an equal efficiency this _METHOD_ the notion that also _METHOD_ is present as a heterotrimer with in plants . additionally we found that the lifetimes measured for _METHOD_ did not correlate negatively with the intensity of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ which again indicates that the fret observed is not due to surface concentration effects . in order to gain insight into the location of heterotrimer formation we co _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ together with the lipidation motif mutants of . surprisingly _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ distribution of _METHOD_ could not be restored as was also observed for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . similarly was not able to rescue _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ heterodimer . since the wild type heterodimer and the subunit were able to tether to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in the presence of their nonlipidated interacting partners these results indicate that the heterotrimer is assembled at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ .
