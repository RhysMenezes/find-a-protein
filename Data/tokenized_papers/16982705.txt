by screening genome databases genes encoding _LOCATION_ proteins homologous to nucleobase ascorbate transporters were identified in arabidopsis thaliana . a similar number of genes was found in the rice genome . the plant nat proteins split into five clades based on protein multisequence alignments . this classification nicely correlates with the patterns of organ and tissue specific _PROTEIN_ during the whole life cycle of a. thaliana . interestingly _PROTEIN_ of two members of clade iii _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was found to be up regulated in undifferentiated tissues such as callus or tumors produced by agrobacterium tumefaciens . clade v comprises _PROTEIN_ possessing a hydrophilic n terminal extension . transient _PROTEIN_ of green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusions in different _METHOD_ showed that _PROTEIN_ along with _PROTEIN_ and are located in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . mutations in any of the atnat genes do not induce phenotypic alterations . the absence of obvious mutant phenotypes in single but also in double and triple mutants suggests a high degree of functional redundancy between atnat genes but might also point to redundant functions provided by genes or pathways unrelated to the atnats .
the completed a. thaliana genome sequencing project opened the way for the analysis of gene families and their functional characterization . to identify plant nat proteins the amino acid sequence of the rat vitamin c transporter was used to conduct blast searches against the a. thaliana genome sequence . a total of genes encoding putative nat proteins were found in the a. thaliana genome . the rice genome also contains a nat family comprising genes . these genes are highly similar to atnats . in addition the ncbi database contains one cdna from maize one from mesembryanthemum crystallinum one from cotton _PROTEIN_ and one from tomato encoding nat proteins . cdnas encoded by the predicted atnats genes were isolated either by screening a cdna library from a. thaliana or by reverse transcription pcr using total rna from a. thaliana seedlings as template . the and _PROTEIN_ sequences differ from the predicted ones and the corrected sequences were deposited in genbank under the accession numbers and respectively . a multiple sequence alignment was conducted with nat protein sequences from plants animals and fungi and used for the construction of a phylogenetic tree . the plant nat proteins can be found in five different clades of the phylogenetic tree with a. thaliana nats present in four of them . all a. thaliana nat proteins share identical amino acid residues with each other and with nat proteins from other plants . the similarity of the plant nat proteins to the vitamin c transporter from mammals and to the nucleobase transporters from a. nidulans is about and < respectively . sequence alignments of nat proteins clearly reveal five regions of high similarity and in addition several residues that are absolutely or highly conserved including the so called nat signature motif nxgxxxxt . this motif is present in a domain critical for substrate recognition in aspergillus uapa and uapc purine transporters . _PROTEIN_ and differ from the other nats in having a histidine residue instead of the conserved glycine at position of this motif and also two insertions of and amino acid residues in the hydrophilic loops between _LOCATION_ spanning helices vii and viii and xii and xiii respectively . in summary atnat proteins share similarities with both ascorbate transporters from mammals and nucleobase transporters from fungi that transport either nucleobases or ascorbate but not both substrates . unfortunately it is not possible at the moment to distinguish between ascorbate and nucleobase transporting nats on the basis of their overall sequence similarities or of specific sequence motifs . so far only a nucleobase transporter from maize has been characterized as a transporter specific for xanthine and uric acid . interestingly clusters together with a rice nat but not with any nats from a. thaliana suggesting that the substrates of the atnats could be different . the nats are highly hydrophobic proteins . the number of putative _LOCATION_ spanning domains was calculated using nine different _METHOD_ . because the number of predicted _LOCATION_ spanning helices of a particular protein differs significantly between the individual _METHOD_ the statistical median was calculated for each protein . the atnat proteins are predicted to possess _LOCATION_ spanning helices . sequence alignments of nat proteins revealed that _PROTEIN_ possesses a highly hydrophilic n terminal extension of about amino acid residues that could serve as an organellar targeting sequence . indeed _PROTEIN_ along with and are assumed to be _LOCATION_ localized according to several prediction _METHOD_ . the other nat proteins obviously do not possess any targeting signals . to obtain experimental evidence for targeting of _PROTEIN_ protein to a particular subcellular compartment _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ translational fusions were generated and transiently _PROTEIN_ in a. thaliana cells by agrobacterium mediated transformation and in onion epidermal cells by biolistic transformation . using both methods _METHOD_ from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion was found in the peripheral region of the cells while the product from a fusion using only the hydrophilic n terminal extension was localized in the _LOCATION_ . in order to differentiate between cell wall _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and tonoplast _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transformed cells were treated with m nacl which induces plasmolysis . as a result the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ is internalized along with all cellular organelles the _LOCATION_ collapses undergoing folding while the cell wall remains unchanged . fig . c illustrates _METHOD_ and bright field images of plasmolysed onion cells showing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ rather than to _LOCATION_ . the same localization was found for _PROTEIN_ and two proteins constituting a subclade of clade iii . the tissue specific _PROTEIN_ of atnat genes was first studied by rt pcr using cdnas from leaves _METHOD_ flowers and roots of soil grown week old a. thaliana plants . four different patterns of _PROTEIN_ were obtained . and showed almost the same level of rna accumulation in all tissues examined . _PROTEIN_ in all tissues with a lower level in leaves was observed for and . _PROTEIN_ and are predominantly _PROTEIN_ in flowers . for and no _PROTEIN_ could be detected in any of the tested tissues . it should be noted that rt pcr analyses were performed using and cycles to illustrate better the differences in the level of _PROTEIN_ in the different organs tested . for a detailed analysis of organ and tissue specific _PROTEIN_ profiles of the atnat genes at different growth stages transgenic a. thaliana plants were generated _PROTEIN_ the gus reporter gene driven by the individual atnat promoters . in all cases a promoter region of approximately kb the first exon and intron and part of the second exon were amplified . the histochemical analysis of gus activity during the first weeks of growth was performed with seedlings grown on plates while adult tissues were analyzed after transferring the plants to soil . except for gus activity could be detected in all plants . as shown below the _PROTEIN_ of nat genes nicely correlated with the categorization of the particular atnat proteins into the phylogenetic clades/subclades i.e . nat proteins belonging to the same clade/subclade possess similar patterns of _PROTEIN_ and are expected to serve similar functions . clade i can be subdivided into two subclades one consisting of and and the other of . both and showed a similar _PROTEIN_ pattern during germination with being more strongly _PROTEIN_ . while was _PROTEIN_ in cotyledons at d after imbibition the _PROTEIN_ of could be detected in the cotyledons only at dai . in both cases the activity was found at the major and minor veins of cotyledons and young leaves and especially concentrated at the shoot apex . this pattern of _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in mature leaves and pediceles . in the root system the activity of the promoter was found at meristematic areas root tips and _PROTEIN_ root primordia . in reproductive organs is poorly _PROTEIN_ while is highly _PROTEIN_ during gynoecium development disappearing with maturation . _PROTEIN_ could be detected at dai at the apical meristem and this pattern was _PROTEIN_ for the next weeks . _PROTEIN_ on gus activity was observed exclusively in the major veins of rosette leaves and pedicels . in the root system gus staining was detected in the central cylinder and at meristematic areas root tips and _PROTEIN_ root primordia . in flower buds _PROTEIN_ was found in the gynoecium during development but was disappearing after pollination . during embryogenesis weak gus staining was observed at the mature embryo stage . clade ii is subdivided into two subclades one consisting of and the other one containing two highly related proteins and . notably and could not be analyzed separately on microarrays due to this high degree of similarity . _PROTEIN_ was found at dai in some cells at the embryonic root area and some isolated cells of the elongation zone . the _PROTEIN_ in roots is very strong in week old seedlings and is widespread to the whole root central cylinder . no _PROTEIN_ was observed in meristematic areas or in developing secondary roots . this pattern was _PROTEIN_ during development . in the floral organs promoter activity was detected in the filaments and stigmatic papillae of flowers after pollination and in developing siliques . the promoter is barely active . _PROTEIN_ was only found in specialized regions such as _PROTEIN_ in the apical meristem and the hydatodes in developed leaves . the promoter activity is below the detection level because no promoter driven gus activity could be detected at all . clade iii can be subdivided into two subclades comprising and and _PROTEIN_ and respectively . _PROTEIN_ is weak and could first be detected in week old seedlings in the vasculature of developing leaves . the _PROTEIN_ was restricted to minor veins a pattern that was _PROTEIN_ in adult rosettes . in contrast rt pcr analysis provided evidence that is also _PROTEIN_ in other tissues such as _METHOD_ roots and flowers . these discrepancies may be the result of differences in mrna stability or the absence of additional promoter or enhancer elements that were not covered by the promoter region used for the reporter gene fusion . no _PROTEIN_ was found in other organs or tissues except for the seed coat at the mature embryo stage . in contrast is strongly _PROTEIN_ gus staining could be detected at dai in the apical region of the cotyledons and in the whole vasculature at dai . in developing leaves the minor veins and the surrounding cells showed strong _PROTEIN_ as is the case for the central cylinder of roots and the _PROTEIN_ root primordia . in reproductive organs _PROTEIN_ was found in the vasculature of sepals filaments and carpels . in developing siliques _PROTEIN_ was confined to the vascular strands . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and members of the second subclade of clade iii was found only in ovules and is _PROTEIN_ during embryogenesis . while _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is weak that of _PROTEIN_ is strong in the endosperm and the embryo . the strongest _PROTEIN_ was observed at the heart stage disappearing afterwards but being _PROTEIN_ at the seed coat . clade v includes and _PROTEIN_ which show overlapping but distinct _PROTEIN_ patterns . _PROTEIN_ was found at the leaf primordia of week old seedlings and at a _PROTEIN_ stage at the vasculature of pedicels and rosette leaves . this pattern of _PROTEIN_ was also observed in mature rosette leaves and _METHOD_ where a weak but still visible staining could be detected in mesophyll cells . gus staining was also found in the central cylinder of mature roots and in the vasculature of sepals carpels and siliques . _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ rather constitutively and more strongly than . at dai _PROTEIN_ was found in the whole seedling and at dai in hypocotyls cotyledons and the meristematic area of root tips . this _PROTEIN_ pattern was _PROTEIN_ until dai when the vasculature showed very strong gus staining . three week old plants showed gus activity in all aerial parts including both mesophyll and vascular tissues . in roots the _PROTEIN_ was found in secondary roots . in the reproductive organs _PROTEIN_ was detected in sepals filaments and in carpels including the vascular tissue ovules and the papillae . _PROTEIN_ promoter activity was found at all stages during embryogenesis in the embryo proper and endosperm and the whole pod tissue . all atnats except for are represented on the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ genome array and according to atgenexpress data analyzed using genevestigator the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is up regulated several times in a. tumefaciens induced tumors . to confirm these data a. thaliana plants were infected with the a. tumefaciens virulent strain at the base of stalk inflorescences . rna was extracted at different times during the proliferation of tumors and the levels of all atnat transcripts were analyzed by semi quantitative rt pcr . transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ and the homologous gene _PROTEIN_ increased during tumor growth while those of all other atnat s remained unchanged . moreover plants _PROTEIN_ the gus gene under the control of the _PROTEIN_ and promoters showed gus activities in tumors of infected plants . tumor formation in plant tissues is caused by an imbalance of the hormones auxin and cytokinin . another example of a deregulated control of cell division and growth is the formation of undifferentiated callus tissue . we therefore analyzed the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and during the development of callus from a. thaliana cotyledons . as shown in fig . c the transcript abundance of _PROTEIN_ and genes was high in this tissue while no transcripts could be detected in cotyledons used as donor tissue . moreover transgenic callus developed from gus and gus cotyledons showed intense gus activity . the level of _PROTEIN_ of all other members of the atnat gene family was also analyzed during the induction of callus formation from cotyledons . except for the _PROTEIN_ of and that was always under the limits of detection a basal level of _PROTEIN_ for all other atnat genes was confirmed in the cotyledons . after d of callus induction the level of all atnat transcripts increased . the _PROTEIN_ levels of and were _PROTEIN_ in day old callus while those of and clearly _PROTEIN_ . obviously _PROTEIN_ and function is especially recruited during callus formation in a. thaliana . calli development was also investigated in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants . no obvious phenotypic alterations could be observed and the _PROTEIN_ levels of and both also belonging to clade iii remained unchanged and could apparently not compensate for the loss of _PROTEIN_ and function . to gain insight into the physiological function of plant atnat proteins t dna insertion mutants of all atnat genes were isolated from wisconsin salk and gabi kat lines respectively via a pcr screening strategy . all mutant lines analyzed showed no detectable _PROTEIN_ of the corresponding genes as analyzed by rt pcr . however none of the lines displayed any informative phenotypical difference compared with the wild type neither when grown in the greenhouse nor when exposed to various environmental _PROTEIN_ . the absence of visible mutant phenotypes may be due to functional redundancies within the atnat clades allowing compensation for the loss of a single gene . to reduce possible redundancies homozygous double mutants were generated between mutants belonging to the same clade/subclade and _PROTEIN_ and and and and and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . a triple mutant _PROTEIN_ was generated by crossing the double homozygous mutant nat _PROTEIN_ with . none of these mutants including the triple mutant showed any obvious phenotypical alteration when compared with the wild type . further analyses of these mutants grown under more sophisticated conditions might potentially reveal hidden functions that the nat family members have in a. thaliana . to investigate whether nat mutants are affected in their ascorbate and/or glutathione contents roots and rosettes of seedlings grown under moderate light were harvested before and after exposure to high light and the content of ascorbate and gsh was subsequently determined by hplc . no significant differences in the content or in the ratio of reduced/oxidized _METHOD_ of ascorbate and gsh could be observed as compared with the wild type . the lack of any mutant phenotype even in triple mutants of atnats points to a high redundancy of nat functions in plants . indeed many of the nat genes in a. thaliana show an overlapping _PROTEIN_ indicating that the disruption of one or more genes could be compensated by other nat genes or by genes unrelated to nats e.g . other transporters . the comparative analysis of the _PROTEIN_ patterns of atnat genes revealed that some members of this gene family show ubiquitous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ while the _PROTEIN_ of other atnat genes is restricted to specific tissues _PROTEIN_ . most atnat genes showed a pronounced _PROTEIN_ in vascular tissues an observation that might indicate that atnat functions are associated with long distance transport processes . _PROTEIN_ present in clade v contains a putative n terminal _LOCATION_ targeting sequence but was shown experimentally to localize to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . thus none of the nat proteins reside in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . it appears feasible therefore that as yet unknown transporters distinct from atnats mediate ascorbate transport into _LOCATION_ . although many attempts were made to elucidate the functional activity of atnat proteins including complementation of a. nidulans strains lacking all functional nats heterologous _PROTEIN_ in yeast cells and transport measurements of ascorbate and purines _PROTEIN_ in oocytes or uptake measurements of radiolabeled substrates in whole plants using the knock out lines no clear results could be obtained . it is worth mentioning that the from maize represents the only plant nat protein with an assigned function . because none of the arabidopsis nat proteins clusters with they might have substrate specificities different from . _PROTEIN_ and were localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and their _PROTEIN_ was found exclusively in developing ovules and embryos of a. thaliana plants growing under normal conditions . interestingly the _PROTEIN_ of both genes is recruited during callus formation and tumor development upon infection with a. tumefaciens at the bases of inflorescence stalks of a. thaliana plants . although our knowledge of the biochemical functions and substrate specificities of the atnats is still poor our results suggest that these two members of clade iii are involved in the transport of signal molecules or substrates needed during the fast growth of undifferentiated tissues . further studies are required to shed light on the physiological roles played by members of the nat family in a. thaliana for which a deeper analysis of the nat _PROTEIN_ double mutants might provide a first clue .
nat genes of a. thaliana were identified by blast searches of the ncbi database and the rice genome research program _PROTEIN_ based on sequence similarity with the amino acid sequence of the rat vitc transporter and the purine transporter from zea mays . phylogenetic analysis of their deduced amino acid sequences was conducted using the clustalx program and the results were displayed using the treeview program . arabidopsis thaliana l. ecotype columbia and the mutant lines were grown in the greenhouse under a h h dark regime at day/night temperatures of . alternatively a. thaliana seedlings were first sown on _METHOD_ medium containing sucrose for weeks and then transferred to greenhouse conditions . callus cultures were produced from cotyledons of a. thaliana wild type single and double knock out lines for _PROTEIN_ and and transformants _PROTEIN_ and gus in _METHOD_ medium supplemented with sucrose mg l benzylaminopurine mg l naphthalene acetic acid mg l iaa and mg l dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and solidified with g l agar . calli were _PROTEIN_ by subculturing in the same medium every weeks . the same a. thaliana lines were used to induce tumor growth . the bases of inflorescence stalks were wounded and inoculated with the supervirulent a. tumefaciencs strain . at different times after callus or tumor induction the tissue was collected and used for rt pcr and gus staining . total rna from a. thaliana leaves _METHOD_ flowers roots and tumor tissue was isolated from mg of material using the _PROTEIN_ reagent and the protocol suggested by the manufacturer . a aliquot of total rna was transcribed using superscript ii reverse transcriptase and used directly for rt pcr . specific primers designed to amplify each atnat are listed in supplementary table . amplification conditions were as follows min at cycles of for s for s and for s followed by incubation for min at . pcr products were separated on a agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide . as loading control the gene was amplified using cycles and specific primers . promoter regions for all members of the atnat family were amplified by rt pcr using specific primers and cloned into either pgptv bar that carries the gus gene or a gateway compatible binary vector designed for promoter driven _PROTEIN_ of the gus gene that carries the kanamycin resistance gene . cloning using gateway vectors was done using reagents and protocols from invitrogen . oligonucleotide primers were designed to amplify fragments containing the promoter region the first exon and intron and part of the second exon . the plasmids containing the chimeric patnat gus genes were introduced into a. thaliana by a. tumefaciens mediated transformation using the vacuum infiltration method . transgenic lines were selected with _PROTEIN_ or kanamycin and analyzed for gus activity . seedlings or tissues from transgenic plants were submerged in staining solution containing mm na po mm edta mm ferricyanide mm ferrocyanide triton x and mm bromo chloro indolyl _PROTEIN_ cyclohexylamine . after overnight incubation at the staining solution was removed and the tissues were fixed with ethanol acetic acid and formaldehyde . the tissue was cleared by incubation in ethanol at . developmental patterns of promoter activity were analyzed in t plants . siliques at different developmental stages were harvested and excised lengthwise prior to gus staining . dissected embryos were cleared in chloral hydrate water glycerin and observed under a nikon eclipse microscope equipped with a digital camera . samples to be sectioned were stained as described above and fixed in glutaraldehyde overnight at . fixed tissues were dehydrated through an ethanol series and embedded in paraplast . embedded material was cut into sections using a microtome dewaxed with rotihistol mounted on glass slides with entellan new and observed under the microscope . _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ fusions were constructed using the full length coding sequence or alternatively a region containing the putative transit peptide _PROTEIN_ fused to the _METHOD_ coding sequence and flanked by the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter and terminator sequences . _PROTEIN_ full length cdna was amplified using the primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and the short fragment with the primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in the case of _PROTEIN_ the full length cdna was amplified using the primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with the primer pair _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the fragments obtained were cloned into pentr/d topo . _METHOD_ fusion constructs were made by subcloning the coding sequence into _METHOD_ a gateway compatible binary vector designed for promoter driven _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ fusion proteins . cloning using gateway vector was done using reagents and protocols from invitrogen . transient transformation of a. thaliana cells was conducted as described by koroleva et al . using the virulent agrobacterium strain . particle bombardment assays were performed on the adaxial epidermal peels from onion bulb scales . the plasmids carrying the _METHOD_ fusions were precipitated onto diameter gold particles and bombarded on the specimens using a helium gun _PROTEIN_ and rupture discs of p.s.i . bombarded tissues were incubated at for h in the dark . plasmolysis was induced by incubating mounted epidermis slices in m nacl for min . _METHOD_ microscopy was performed using a nikon eclipse microscope coupled to a digital camera . detection of _METHOD_ was achieved by using a _METHOD_ filter . wisconsin salk and gabi kat insertion lines were obtained from the wisconsin knock out facility the nottingham arabidopsis stock center and the gabi kat facility respectively . the genotype of the lines was determined using a pcr based approach . basically genomic dna was isolated from individual plants and used as template for pcr amplifications of the wild type and the nat alleles . the position of the t dna insertion sites in the nat genes was verified by amplifying and sequencing the t dna flanking genomic dna . supplementary material mentioned in the article is
