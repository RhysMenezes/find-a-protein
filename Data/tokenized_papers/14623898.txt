the _PROTEIN_ tumor suppressor gene affects multiple cellular processes including cell growth proliferation and cell migration by antagonizing phosphatidylinositol kinase _PROTEIN_ . however _METHOD_ by which _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is regulated have not been studied extensively . similar to _PROTEIN_ tumor necrosis _PROTEIN_ affects a wide spectrum of diseases including inflammatory processes and cancer by acting as a mediator of apoptosis inflammation and immunity . in this study we show that treatment of cancer cell lines with tnf _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in addition overexpression of tnf downstream signaling targets _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ inducing kinase and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ nf lowers _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ suggesting that tnf induced down regulation of _PROTEIN_ is mediated through a tnf pathway . down regulation of _PROTEIN_ by nik/nf results in activation of the _PROTEIN_ pathway and augmentation of tnf induced _PROTEIN_ stimulation . importantly we demonstrate that this effect is associated with a lack of an inhibitor of autoregulatory loop . moreover these findings suggest the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and nf via transcriptional regulation of _PROTEIN_ and offer one possible explanation for increased tumorigenesis in _METHOD_ in which nf is chronically activated . in such a tumor system these findings suggest a positive feedback loop whereby akt activation of nf further stimulates akt via down regulation of the _PROTEIN_ inhibitor _PROTEIN_ .
tnf treatment _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ examine the effect of tnf on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ we used the human colon cancer cell line a cell line without mutation in the endogenous _PROTEIN_ gene is used extensively as a model of intestinal epithelial cell proliferation/differentiation and colorectal cancer . cells growing in serum containing medium were treated with increasing concentrations of tnf for h and extracted for protein _PROTEIN_ . western blotting demonstrated a tnf mediated dose dependent _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ . concomitant with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a similar reduction in was also observed demonstrating tnf induced degradation . to examine whether the reduction of _PROTEIN_ protein was linked to a modification in gene _PROTEIN_ cells were treated with nm tnf over a time course and total cellular mrna was extracted for analysis of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by real time rt pcr . as shown in fig . tnf caused a significant reduction in _PROTEIN_ mrna which was apparent after h of treatment and continued over h. in addition we constructed a reporter plasmid containing bp of the human _PROTEIN_ promoter inserted upstream of the luciferase reporter gene . this plasmid was transfected into cells and luciferase assay was performed h after nm tnf treatment luciferase activity was reduced in tnf treated cells as compared with untreated cells . together these data indicate that tnf down regulates _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ at the level of gene transcription . to assess whether the tnf effect on _PROTEIN_ is limited to certain cell types we examined other human derived cell lines . similar to results obtained in cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ was noted in the colon cancer cell line and in the cervical cancer cell line siha . however a reduction in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was not observed in the human embryonic kidney cell line suggesting that the tnf mediated reduction in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is cell line dependent . nf activation is sustained in cells treated with tnf the nf pathway is an important target of tnf signaling we analyzed key elements of this pathway after tnf treatment in cells . for this purpose cells were treated with a single dose of tnf and analyzed over a h time course . as expected from the above results _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ and h after tnf treatment . concomitant with _PROTEIN_ reduction this treatment produced a sustained reduction in throughout the h time course . to confirm that nf activation accompanied the tnf induced reduction of _LOCATION_ protein was extracted from treated and untreated cells and analyzed by elisa based dna binding activity of nf using a consensus double stranded oligonucleotide . analysis for nf showed maximal binding activity at h of tnf treatment whereas maximal activity for nf was observed within h of tnf treatment . the specificity of dna binding was confirmed by competition assays where free floating excess oligonucleotide blocked both and nf binding activities . these data corroborate the finding that tnf treatment increases nf binding activity and correlates with reduction in _PROTEIN_ . in addition these data show that nf activity is sustained without signs of inhibition as might be expected because of an autoregulatory inhibition . nik and activation of nf _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ binding to activates nf through recruitment of the _PROTEIN_ protein and the serine/threonine kinase nik . subsequently nik phosphorylates kinase which targets for ubiquitination and proteasome mediated degradation thus allowing nf to translocate into the cell _LOCATION_ . to determine whether tnf induced _PROTEIN_ reduction is mediated through nik an adenovirus containing the nik gene was used to infect cells . consistent with the effect observed previously by tnf treatment nik overexpression _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as well as the level of suggesting nf activation . conversely we analyzed the effect of the _PROTEIN_ of the superrepressor of after cell infection with the recombinant adenovirus aa . the superrepressor of does not undergo degradation upon tnf stimulation hence it sequesters nf in the cytoplasm . we found that the infection of superrepressor actually increased _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the endogenous level of . next we examined whether nf can directly suppress _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by overexpressing the subunit of nf in cells . overexpression of protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and in combination with tnf treatment an additive suppression was observed . to provide additional evidence that the tnf induced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is functionally dependent on the activation of the nf pathway cells were treated with nm tnf together with a cell permeable peptide that binds to uncomplexed nf and prevents _LOCATION_ translocation of nf . as shown in fig . peptide prevented the _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in tnf treated cells without affecting the _PROTEIN_ in confirming that this inhibitor acts downstream of on the translocation of nf . moreover the mutant inactive peptide was unable to prevent the tnf induced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . together these data indicate that tnf down regulates _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by activating the pathway . tnf induced down regulation of _PROTEIN_ is not dependent on _PROTEIN_ activates the _PROTEIN_ pathway through tnfr/insulin receptor substrate mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of the regulatory subunit of _PROTEIN_ . it was reported previously that tnf activation of nf requires both nik and _PROTEIN_ however in different cell types tnf activation of nf is not dependent on _PROTEIN_ whereas platelet derived growth _PROTEIN_ mediated activation of nf involves _PROTEIN_ activation of kinase . in the case of cells infected with the nik encoding adenovirus we found a _PROTEIN_ in the total amount of akt protein but a strong activation of this kinase assessed by its phosphorylation at residue ser . confirming the functional activation of akt increased phosphorylation of a downstream substrate of akt gsk was also observed in nik overexpressing cells . these results suggest that akt is activated directly by tnf signaling through insulin receptor substrate and _PROTEIN_ to enhance to tnf dependent down regulation of _PROTEIN_ and that activation of akt is augmented by the _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ which antagonizes akt activation by _PROTEIN_ inhibition . to examine whether tnf mediated down regulation of _PROTEIN_ is dependent on the _PROTEIN_ pathway in cells the _PROTEIN_ inhibitor and the akt inhibitor were used to pretreat the cells prior to tnf incubation . both and the selective akt inhibitor failed to prevent the _PROTEIN_ in and _PROTEIN_ in tnf treated cells . these data suggest that the down regulation of _PROTEIN_ by tnf is mediated by nik independent of the _PROTEIN_ pathway and that the activation of akt in tnf treated cells is augmented resulting from the decay of the antagonizing phosphatase _PROTEIN_ . autoregulatory loop is absent in activity is controlled by _METHOD_ which sequester nf to the cytoplasm whereas tnf stimulation and subsequent degradation allow nf _LOCATION_ translocation and dna binding . nf signaling is complex in that nf activity is modulated by rapid transcriptional autoregulatory loop involving nf mediated synthesis which occurs within hours of tnf stimulation . in addition it was shown recently that nf mediated synthesis provides a strong negative feedback to inhibit nf activation . to obtain insight into why _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is down regulated in cells by tnf but such an effect failed to occur in cells we examined the changes in _PROTEIN_ level of and _PROTEIN_ when cells are treated with nm tnf over a time course . as shown in fig . tnf treatment gradually _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in cells this was because of the progressive and sustained _PROTEIN_ in levels . thus no rebound synthesis was observed in cells beyond h of tnf treatment . similar but not as dramatic results were noted after tnf treatment of siha cells . on the contrary tnf treatment did not result in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in cells . noteworthy tnf produced a rapid initial _PROTEIN_ in at h but this decline was followed by rebound synthesis with resultant increase in levels which exceeded basal _PROTEIN_ up to h . therefore the decay in _PROTEIN_ protein in tnf treated cells is associated with an abnormal deficiency in the autoregulatory loop . these data suggest that sustained nf activation because of prolonged suppression may be responsible for the differential effect noted in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in these two cell lines .
