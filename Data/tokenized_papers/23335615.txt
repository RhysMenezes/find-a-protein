the xylem and phloem major conducting and supporting tissues in vascular plants are established by cell division and cell type specification in the procambium/cambium . the organization of the xylem phloem and procambium/cambium is tightly controlled . however the underlying regulatory _METHOD_ remain largely unknown . in this study we report the discovery of two transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ hook motif _LOCATION_ localized protein _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which regulate vascular tissue boundaries in arabidopsis thaliana roots . in either of the knockout mutants of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ encoding closely related _PROTEIN_ hook transcription _PROTEIN_ a misspecification of tissue boundaries between the xylem and procambium occurred and ectopic xylem developed in the procambium domain . in plants specific types of transcription _PROTEIN_ can serve as direct intercellular signals by moving from one cell to another playing crucial roles in tissue patterning . adding to this paradigm _PROTEIN_ moves actively from the procambium to xylem in the root meristem to regulate the tissue boundaries . when the intercellular movement of _PROTEIN_ was impaired _PROTEIN_ could not complement the xylem phenotype in the _PROTEIN_ . furthermore _PROTEIN_ revealed unique characteristics in that it interacts with _PROTEIN_ in vivo and that this interaction facilitates their intercellular trafficking . taken together this study uncovered a novel mechanism in vascular tissue patterning that requires the intercellular trafficking of two interacting transcription _PROTEIN_ .
xylem precursors in the root are established in the meristem close to the underlying quiescent center _PROTEIN_ . in arabidopsis five or six xylem precursor cells form a single row of xylem axis among which the periphery and center differentiate into protoxylem and metaxylem vessels respectively . to identify transcription _PROTEIN_ potentially involved in this xylem patterning we surveyed and selected transcription _PROTEIN_ that are enriched in the xylem precursor cells using high resolution microarray based gene _PROTEIN_ data available for most cell types in the arabidopsis root . fifteen transcription _PROTEIN_ were chosen for further characterization based on the selection criteria of at least twofold enrichment in the xylem precursor cell type over other root cell types with corrected p values < . to identify the transcription _PROTEIN_ impaired in xylem patterning t dna insertion lines of each candidate were screened for abnormal xylem phenotypes . insertion lines associated with genes for three transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ exhibited abnormal xylem phenotypes . among these _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ encode proteins that belong to the _PROTEIN_ hook family _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . t dna insertions disrupted the third exon of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and the first exon of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ respectively . real time rt pcr analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was reduced by in the _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type root and that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was reduced by in the _PROTEIN_ . since these data indicated that _PROTEIN_ is likely a null mutant whereas _PROTEIN_ is not we first characterized _PROTEIN_ for its vascular tissue patterning in the root . in _PROTEIN_ we observed additional strands of protoxylem and metaxylem . this extra protoxylem phenotype was detected in of individual _PROTEIN_ plants examined . here we used the protoxylem phenotype to further dissect _PROTEIN_ function . our histological analysis did not indicate any obvious defect in the phloem patterning of _PROTEIN_ . extra xylem vessel formation occurred in the maturation zone of the _PROTEIN_ root . however cell type specific root _PROTEIN_ data indicated that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in the root meristem before vascular cells begin differentiation . to identify the role of _PROTEIN_ in the root meristem we introduced several vascular cell type specific markers and compared their _PROTEIN_ patterns in _PROTEIN_ to those in the wild type root meristem . first we investigated the impact of _PROTEIN_ on xylem domain specification using _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ which is specifically _PROTEIN_ in the xylem precursor cells . in contrast with the wild type where _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ is restricted to a single row of xylem precursors the _PROTEIN_ of _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ expanded to the adjacent cells in the procambium domain . this _PROTEIN_ pattern is consistent with the formation of extra xylem strands in _PROTEIN_ . another marker _LOCATION_ is _PROTEIN_ in a protoxylem precursor and the two neighboring pericycle cells . consistent with _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ domain of _LOCATION_ also expanded in _PROTEIN_ being detected in the cells which would belong to procambium in the wild type . these xylem marker analyses suggested that the proper formation of boundaries between the procambium and xylem might require _PROTEIN_ . to further test this idea we checked the status of procambium in _PROTEIN_ by introducing _LOCATION_ which precisely marks procambium domains that neighbor xylem precursors in the root meristem . as expected _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ was absent in the cells where xylem markers had expanded . next to test whether phloem development is affected we introduced proapl _LOCATION_ which is _PROTEIN_ in the developing protophloem sieve element and then switches to the companion cells and metaphloem sieve element into _PROTEIN_ . however as indicated by our histological analysis no obvious changes in proapl _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ were detected in _PROTEIN_ . note also that the overall root growth in _PROTEIN_ was normal . collectively our results support the conclusion that _PROTEIN_ is specifically involved in defining the boundary between the xylem and procambium . to gain insight into the spatio temporal regulation of xylem development by _PROTEIN_ we generated transcriptional and translational fusion lines of _PROTEIN_ . for this we produced constructs driving the _PROTEIN_ of _LOCATION_ or _PROTEIN_ and the coding region of _PROTEIN_ fused to free _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ respectively under the kb long upstream intergenic region of _PROTEIN_ . when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was introduced into _PROTEIN_ all six independent transgenic lines complemented its mutant phenotype negating the formation of ectopic xylem strands . this result indicates that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein is fully functional and that the selected promoter is sufficient for _PROTEIN_ activity . we next analyzed the spatial domain where _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is _PROTEIN_ . consistent with its regulation of the boundaries between the xylem and procambium in the root meristem _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was enriched in the stele of a root meristem . the _PROTEIN_ level of transcriptional _LOCATION_ was very weak but mostly detected in the procambium which was different from the _PROTEIN_ domain detected by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . we further confirmed this discrepancy between transcriptional and protein _PROTEIN_ domains using the transcriptional gus line . contrary to the ubiquitous distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ throughout the stele cells of the root meristem the gus _PROTEIN_ was specific to the procambium . _PROTEIN_ was originally selected as a gene enriched in the xylem precursor however gus _PROTEIN_ suggested that the _PROTEIN_ transcriptional domain is specific to the procambium . this is likely because the selection for xylem precursor enriched genes was made in the absence of procambium profiling data from the current root _PROTEIN_ map . the spatial expansion of the _PROTEIN_ protein domain from the transcriptional domain indicated that _PROTEIN_ proteins or rnas might move between cells . to examine this further we analyzed the spatial distribution of _PROTEIN_ proteins _PROTEIN_ under the stele specific cytokinin response _PROTEIN_ promoter . consistent with observations made with transcriptional and translational fusion lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals expanded outside the stele and reached the _PROTEIN_ root cap cells in the meristem region . in the meristematic zone we always detected _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the endodermis where _PROTEIN_ is not normally _PROTEIN_ . though most of the mobile transcription _PROTEIN_ have been shown to move as proteins there are cases when mrnas move between cells . to test the latter possibility for _PROTEIN_ we examined the mrna domains of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants by performing rna in situ hybridization . an antisense _METHOD_ probe successfully detected _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mrna only in the stele cells which was consistent with the control experiment employing _LOCATION_ . based on the results from _PROTEIN_ analyses of proteins and mrnas of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants we concluded that the _PROTEIN_ protein rather than its transcript acts non cell autonomously . numerous studies have shown that many mobile proteins move from one cell to another through plasmodesmata . given that the size exclusion limit of pd in the root meristem is suggested to be around kd _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ might move between cells in a targeted manner . to gain a better understanding of _PROTEIN_ movement the coding region of _PROTEIN_ was fused with tandem yellow _METHOD_ proteins _METHOD_ _METHOD_ driven by the _PROTEIN_ promoter and introduced into an _PROTEIN_ mutant . the extra xylem phenotype associated with _PROTEIN_ was complemented in all nine transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . this result shows that fusion proteins between _PROTEIN_ and tandem _METHOD_ are also fully functional . we then analyzed their cell to cell movement capacity relative to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . triple and quadruple _METHOD_ have large molecular _METHOD_ and therefore can significantly reduce the protein movement between cells . our confocal analysis suggested that adding tandem _METHOD_ significantly interferes with the movement of _PROTEIN_ but does not abolish the movement activity completely . next we calculated how frequently movement occurred for the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ tandem _METHOD_ proteins . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ movement from the stele to endodermis was detected in all five independent lines accounting for a rate . by contrast only and of the transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ respectively exhibited protein trafficking from the stele to endodermis . we then quantified the movement of proteins in the same transgenic lines by measuring and comparing _METHOD_ signals in the pericycle cells and the neighboring endodermal cells . the average _METHOD_ intensity of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the endodermis was of the _METHOD_ measured in the adjacent pericycle . by contrast the signal intensities measured for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were and respectively of the adjacent pericycle . the levels of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ tandem _METHOD_ were similar in the pericycle indicating that the low endodermis to pericycle _METHOD_ ratio measured for _PROTEIN_ tandem _METHOD_ is not the result of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ has a strong tendency to move between cells which can not be easily blocked by increasing its protein size to a great extent . to gain insight into the non cell autonomous function of _PROTEIN_ in developmental control we _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fused with _METHOD_ under the _PROTEIN_ promoter in _PROTEIN_ . similar to what was observed in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants fusing _METHOD_ to _PROTEIN_ restricted its movement only partially . next to test whether the movement of _PROTEIN_ into the xylem precursors contributes to the complementation of the extra protoxylem phenotype we measured the frequencies of the events detecting _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals in the xylem precursors and associated normal xylem phenotypes using individual progenies each from six independent transgenic lines . unlike _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which rescued the xylem phenotype of _PROTEIN_ in of plants examined _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ rescued the xylem phenotype only in . in seedlings where _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was detected in the xylem precursors all exhibited a normal xylem phenotype . by contrast in the absence of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the xylem precursors the extra xylem phenotype was not rescued in any case . such a strong correlation between _PROTEIN_ movement to the xylem precursors and xylem phenotype indicates that the movement of _PROTEIN_ from procambial cells to xylem precursors is required to define and _PROTEIN_ the boundary between the xylem and procambium . a previous phylogenetic analysis suggested that _PROTEIN_ is the most closely related homolog of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . given that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ share amino acid similarity and that both play a role in xylem patterning they might function in a partially redundant manner . however the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant did not show any additional xylem phenotype to what was observed in each single mutant . real time rt pcr showed that the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ was not affected in the _PROTEIN_ background or vice versa . we confirmed this again by generating and phenotyping artificial microrna lines that simultaneously knocked down _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . these plants exhibited a similar phenotype to the single and double mutants . in addition _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ introduced into _PROTEIN_ was not able to rescue the extra xylem phenotype despite the clear presence of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein in the xylem precursors . collectively these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function in a complementary manner . for _PROTEIN_ to function complementarily to _PROTEIN_ it is likely to be present in the same spatial domain as _PROTEIN_ . indeed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins _PROTEIN_ under the _PROTEIN_ promoter in the wild type background were observed in the _LOCATION_ of both procambium and xylem precursors of the root meristem strengthening the notion that they function in a complementary manner . however gus _PROTEIN_ under the same _PROTEIN_ promoter was _PROTEIN_ restricted to the endodermis in the _PROTEIN_ elongation zone and onwards revealing different distribution patterns from the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . thus _PROTEIN_ proteins which are generated in the elongation and maturation zones of a root seem to move down to the root meristem through the stele . next we investigated whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ form a functional protein complex by performing yeast two hybrid assays . this experiment showed that they undergo not only homomeric but also heteromeric interactions in yeast . to demonstrate their interaction directly in vivo we next performed _METHOD_ resonance energy transfer analysis using an enhanced green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and mcherry pair by employing acceptor photobleaching . this method is useful for determining the extent of fret by monitoring an increase in donor _METHOD_ _METHOD_ after acceptor photobleaching . first an _METHOD_ and mcherry pair was used as the fret negative control by coexpressing them in arabidopsis leaf epidermal cells via biolistic dna delivery . the _LOCATION_ of the target cells were selected as the region of interest to monitor the fret . multichannel images collected before bleaching showed the colocalization of _METHOD_ and mcherry clearly with similar signal intensities in the _LOCATION_ . when the acceptor was bleached in this experiment a reduction in mcherry emission was observed . however this caused a negligible change in the signal intensity of the donor _METHOD_ confirming that no fret occurs between the free _METHOD_ and mcherry even though they are colocalized . additional controls with combinatorial _METHOD_ pairs _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ also confirmed the absence of fret . we then examined the existence of fret between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ as donor and _PROTEIN_ mcherry as acceptor under the same experimental conditions and parameters used for acceptor photobleaching of the negative controls . to monitor the fret of this pair the _LOCATION_ of target cells coexpressing both proteins were selected once more . bleaching of the acceptor resulted in loss of the _PROTEIN_ mcherry signal in a typical experiment as shown in figures and . in contrast with the negative controls however the acceptor bleaching led to a significant gain in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal by without background subtraction . for quantitative analysis three independent fret experiments for all combinations were subsequently performed . the result showed that the mean fret efficiency between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ mcherry was which was statistically significant compared with the mean values to of the negative controls . this result provides solid evidence that the heteromeric complexes can form in planta . what about homomeric complexes as suggested by the yeast two hybrid experiment ? intriguingly the fret efficiency of homomeric _PROTEIN_ formation was statistically not different from the negative controls . by contrast the fret efficiency of homomeric _PROTEIN_ was slightly above the threshold level but still significantly lower than that of the _PROTEIN_ heteromeric complex . based on these fret analyses the heteromeric complex is likely the more prevalent form than the homomeric complex in planta . these fret experiments firmly establish in vivo interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and that this interaction is necessary for successful boundary formation between the xylem and procambium . cell to cell movement of some transcription _PROTEIN_ is influenced by their physical interaction with other transcription _PROTEIN_ . having established in vivo interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we asked how their interaction relates to the cell to cell movement . to this end we employed transient _PROTEIN_ assays using arabidopsis leaf tissues . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ coding regions were fused to mcherry and _METHOD_ respectively and biolistically bombarded into leaves detached from week old arabidopsis columbia . control bombardment using vector plasmids _PROTEIN_ free _METHOD_ or mcherry resulted in cell to cell movement in to of transfected cells ranging from limited to extensive movement as has been observed previously under similar experimental conditions . _PROTEIN_ mcherry or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ alone resulted in single epidermal cell _PROTEIN_ only revealing no movement activity . the total number of transfected cells examined was and each . this result is not surprising given that the intercellular movement of non cell autonomous transcription _PROTEIN_ functioning in roots such as shortroot _PROTEIN_ is influenced by a cell type specific _PROTEIN_ scarecrow for example . _PROTEIN_ data from the _METHOD_ browser database indicate that neither _PROTEIN_ nor _PROTEIN_ is significantly _PROTEIN_ in the examined leaf developmental stage . next we examined the intercellular movement of _PROTEIN_ in the presence of _PROTEIN_ . as controls for dual protein trafficking we performed a combinatorial experiment in which _PROTEIN_ mcherry was cobombarded with pdgc for _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with pdcc for mcherry . these combinations showed that although free _METHOD_ or mcherry moved out of the cotransfected target cell at a normal frequency _PROTEIN_ mcherry or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not . this result is consistent with the lack of movement of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ when _PROTEIN_ alone . however to our surprise when _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were coexpressed their movement into a neighboring epidermal cell was observed . interestingly the _METHOD_ signals associated with both proteins were dispersed throughout the cytoplasm in addition to strong _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ within the target cells while accumulating disproportionately in the _LOCATION_ within the neighboring cell into which they moved . although the occurrence of this movement was observed at a low frequency and the extent of movement was limited to a single neighboring cell this movement was reproducible and consistent in multiple repeats . this result does not address whether these proteins move as a complex per se . however it supports the notion that coexpression facilitates their movement . having found that _PROTEIN_ cotrafficks with _PROTEIN_ in leaf epidermis we queried whether _PROTEIN_ is also capable of moving between root cells . consistent with the bombardment assay we observed _METHOD_ signals within the endodermis of the transgenic plants that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the wild type background . we also investigated whether the intercellular trafficking of _PROTEIN_ is facilitated by _PROTEIN_ as shown in the leaves by examining _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization in the _PROTEIN_ roots _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . however we did not find any significant reduction in the frequencies of xylem localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the _PROTEIN_ . this result suggests that _PROTEIN_ movement is not fully dependent on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ may move on its own in the root or another member of the _PROTEIN_ family may substitute for _PROTEIN_ in promoting _PROTEIN_ movement . given that _PROTEIN_ requires _PROTEIN_ for activating downstream components such a heteromeric complex would be functionally critical _PROTEIN_ of its involvement in the cell to cell mobility .
