identification and characterization of anion channel genes in plants represent a goal for a better understanding of their central role in cell signaling osmoregulation nutrition and metabolism . though channel activities have been well characterized in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ by electrophysiology the corresponding molecular entities are little documented . indeed the hydrophobic protein equipment of plant _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ still remains largely unknown though several proteomic approaches have been reported . to identify new putative transport _METHOD_ we developed a new proteomic strategy based on _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analyses of a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fraction enriched in hydrophobic proteins . we produced from arabidopsis cell suspensions a highly purified _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fraction and characterized it in detail by immunological and enzymatic tests . using complementary methods for the extraction of hydrophobic proteins and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analyses on mono dimensional gels about proteins have been identified of which had never been found in previous proteomic studies . the inventory of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteome generated by this approach contains numerous _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ integral proteins one third displaying at least four transmembrane segments . the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization was confirmed for several proteins therefore validating such proteomic strategy . an in silico analysis shows a correlation between the putative functions of the identified proteins and the expected roles for _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in transport signaling cellular traffic and metabolism . this analysis also reveals proteins that display structural properties compatible with transport functions and will constitute interesting targets for further functional studies .
pm fractions were isolated from arabidopsis cell suspensions using the two phase partitioning method . the purity of _LOCATION_ preparations was estimated first from enzymatic assays . the enrichment in pm was estimated at times compared with the micromal fraction . a slight _PROTEIN_ in the ratio of sensitive _PROTEIN_ activities in both fractions revealed a depletion of tonoplast in the pm fraction . a major part of the total _PROTEIN_ activity associated with the pm fraction was vanadate sensitive . this suggests that the pm contamination by tonoplast and other _LOCATION_ displaying _PROTEIN_ activities _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was at most a likely overestimation considering the relative lack of specificity of the inhibitors used in the enzymatic assays . cytochrome c oxidase activity an enzymatic marker of mitochondria was almost undetectable in the pm fraction . this set of results was completed by immunological tests using antibodies against antigens specifically associated with various _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . western blot profiles show that antigens from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ mitochondrial _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ or chloroplast _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ are present in microsomal fractions but can not be detected in pm fractions . the anti h _PROTEIN_ igg preparation does recognize this p type enzyme mostly in the pm fraction further illustrating the enrichment detected by the enzymatic test . these data confirm the high degree of enrichment in the pm fraction and its low level of contamination by organelles and endomembranes . a survey of the literature shows that hydrophilic proteins are routinely extracted by nonionic detergents like triton x or by alkaline treatments such as naoh leading to the recovery after centrifugation of hydrophobic proteins in the pellet . organic solvents have been used successfully for solubilizing highly hydrophobic proteins from _LOCATION_ of the chloroplast envelope and _LOCATION_ . preliminary experiments showed that it was also efficient on pm proteins . several extraction conditions were compared various c/m ratios different extraction ph and temperatures for protein solubilization in laemmli buffer . besides the solubilization in organic solvents a triton x treatment or an alkaline wash of the _LOCATION_ samples was performed to increase the diversity of recovered proteins . whatever the method used proteins were then submitted to one dimensional _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ analyses . the polypeptide profiles of the different fractions obtained after c/m extraction and naoh treatment are shown in figure a and b respectively . when varying the c/m extraction conditions almost similar profiles were obtained except a few new bands appearing in the extreme molecular _METHOD_ . triton x extraction led to polypeptide profiles that were similar for soluble and insoluble fractions and was not used in further experiments . the most hydrophobic proteins contained in the soluble c/m fractions and in the naoh pellet were analyzed . discrete bands were excised from the gels and digested by trypsin prior to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analyses using maldi tof and esi _METHOD_ techniques . moreover to detect the low abundance proteins new c/m and naoh fractions were prepared and analyzed from stacking gels by nanolc _METHOD_ . a total of different peptides were sequenced and matched with different proteins . because we were using arabidopsis which has been completely sequenced the analysis of a single peptide containing about amino acids is usually sufficient for identifying the protein though some sequenced peptides belong to several proteins of a same family which might led to at most identified proteins . among the identified proteins were solubilized in the c/m mixture and were recovered in the insoluble naoh pellet including proteins that are common to both extraction conditions . among the naoh insoluble phase we identified five ribosomal proteins showing that alkaline treatment does not totally eliminate major soluble proteins . these ribosomal proteins were considered as contaminants and were excluded from further analyses . in silico analyses of the whole set of proteins were performed combining the use of several _METHOD_ for physico chemical parameters and structure predictions . the molecular _METHOD_ of the identified proteins ranged from to kda with of them ranging from to kda . the values of their pi are also largely scattered between and . by averaging the data obtained from seven different prediction _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ based on the detection of hydrophobic or amphiphilic helices of the proteins were classified as tm candidate proteins displaying at least one predicted tm span . among them exhibited one to three tm showed four to six tm and had seven to tm . this classification based on the presence of putative helices shows its limit in the identification of _LOCATION_ proteins because the proteins of the porin type known to form a barrel embedded in the _LOCATION_ lipid bilayer have no helices and are therefore not predicted as tm proteins . some of the proteins lacking putative helices can be predicted to be anchored to the _LOCATION_ owing to hydrophobic tails eight proteins have putative myristoylation sites and proteins have putative prenylation sites . in the literature the _PROTEIN_ index is also commonly used to describe the hydrophobicity properties of proteins . the _PROTEIN_ score takes into account the size and the charge of the whole protein and ranges for instance from to in the whole proteome predicted from the escherichia coli genome sequence positive values referring to hydrophobic proteins . the _PROTEIN_ of the arabidopsis _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins analyzed ranges from to . only of the proteins display a _PROTEIN_ value higher than and can thus be considered as highly hydrophobic such as the _PROTEIN_ transporter _PROTEIN_ . the majority of the analyzed proteins has a _PROTEIN_ between and which could not discriminate their hydrophobic or hydrophilic nature . for instance on one hand the p type h _PROTEIN_ displaying tm and generally considered as a highly hydrophobic protein has a _PROTEIN_ of only . on the other hand the d ribulose phosphate epimerase without predicted tm domain has a _PROTEIN_ of . to better define subclasses in the population the _PROTEIN_ index was plotted versus pi . basically three groups of proteins can be distinguished those with relatively low pi and _PROTEIN_ negative _PROTEIN_ those with high pi and negative _PROTEIN_ and the third class displaying high pi but positive _PROTEIN_ scores . as indicated in fig . proteins already described as pm associated are present in each group the h _PROTEIN_ in class i the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored pollen specific protein _PROTEIN_ in class ii and the aquaporin _PROTEIN_ in class iii . therefore none of the groups can be assigned to a contaminant fraction in the pm preparation . proteins displaying the highest number of tm domains _PROTEIN_ belong to class iii but some are present in the two other classes . classes i and ii contain several proteins lacking putative tm domains and containing sites for post traductional modifications that could be responsible for anchoring the protein to the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . classes i and ii also contain proteins associated with a tm protein complex _PROTEIN_ . it is worth noting that unknown proteins also appear in the three classes . comparing to previous data on arabidopsis pm proteome the total number of identified proteins in our study represents around of new proteins including all the more integral ones . another proteomic approach performed on a modified plant pm the peribacteroid _LOCATION_ from lotus japonicus revealed proteins homologous to ours and the majority are orthologous proteins . moreover as the lotus genome is not yet sequenced their identification remains incomplete . this study shows that the two procedures used to recover hydrophobic proteins c/m extraction and alkaline treatment are clearly complementary as already shown in previous studies performed on the chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ . the different methods of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analyses _METHOD_ _METHOD_ appear complementary as well . thirty proteins have been found at least two times in two different gels and have been identified by more than one sequenced peptide . however the _PROTEIN_ that the arabidopsis genome has been fully sequenced allows an accurate identification of all proteins analyzed in _METHOD_ _METHOD_ even if only one peptide has been sequenced . among the proteins extracted from the pm by c/m contained predicted tm and only had a positive _PROTEIN_ . surprisingly we obtained nearly the same results when analyzing the insoluble naoh fraction because of extracted proteins are predicted as transmembranous and have positive _PROTEIN_ . indeed the most hydrophilic proteins and also the most hydrophobic ones were recovered from the alkaline treatment . from the analysis of the hydrophobic proteome of the chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ ferro et al . could identify common features for putative transporters of the chloroplast inner envelope _LOCATION_ such as high pi and high hydrophobicity _PROTEIN_ as the ratio of the number of amino acid residues per number of predicted tm . our analysis of the pm hydrophobic proteome did not reveal any particular characteristic trait specifying pm proteins as pi values were spread over ph units and res/tm ratios were often higher than . the difference between these two hydrophobic proteomes might be related to the lipid composition of these _LOCATION_ as well as to the structure of pm proteins which often exhibit longer _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ loops and longer n and c terminal extensions when compared with envelope proteins . in other respects none of the different parameters used in the present study _PROTEIN_ was sufficient on its own to characterize the hydrophobicity of the pm proteins . it thus appeared necessary to validate experimentally their association with the pm . the quality of the purified pm fraction as assessed by enzymatic and immunological assays was the first criterion for establishing the pm localization of the proteins identified in the course of this study . indeed _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analyses did not reveal the presence of major proteins from other organelles such as the phosphate/triose phosphate translocator or the rubisco for the chloroplasts or of elements of the nadh dehydrogenase the _PROTEIN_ complex the _PROTEIN_ synthase or the cytochrome c reductase the four dominant protein complexes of mitochondria . moreover several proteins identified _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were already well known pm proteins . other proteins already described as pm resident proteins but in other plants are present in the arabidopsis pm fraction thus strengthening their pm localization . this is the case for remorins close to potato remorins the phosphate transporters _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ homologous to identified in tomato _PROTEIN_ similar to the tobacco syntaxin nt _PROTEIN_ and the metal transporter _PROTEIN_ . despite these observations it remains an uncertainty in the subcellular localization of previously unknown gene products . moreover some gene products _PROTEIN_ were previously described in _LOCATION_ compartments other than pm . even if no major proteins from other organelles were identified in the pm fraction it might contain minute amounts of contaminating proteins from other cell compartments and some proteins may have a dual localization . therefore we decided to investigate the subcellular compartmentation of several of the identified proteins with uncertain localization to validate our pm proteomic strategy . the first chosen proteins were unknown abundant proteins identified from the first maldi tof analyses exhibiting negative _PROTEIN_ values and belonging to class i a protein with prohibitin motives a protein previously described as endomembrane associated and cyt which is often described in internal _LOCATION_ compartments . transient _PROTEIN_ of fusion proteins with _METHOD_ protein reporters such as _METHOD_ or was performed in protoplasts isolated from arabidopsis cell suspensions and followed by confocal microscopy observations . green _METHOD_ associated with the _METHOD_ marker clearly delineated the pm upon _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ fusions . the fusion was co _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ fused to _PROTEIN_ a metal transporter targeted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . red and green _METHOD_ signals appear very close to each other but a close up view of the _LOCATION_ area reveals distinct green labeling of the tonoplast and red labeling of the pm thus confirming the pm localization of cyt . the _PROTEIN_ of another _METHOD_ fusion with a protein from the quinone reductase family led to a strong labeling of the pm together with a _METHOD_ background in the _LOCATION_ . in other respects a porin like protein _PROTEIN_ was identified in the pm fraction though members of this family are commonly described as mitochondrial components . in our classification _PROTEIN_ belongs to class ii with _PROTEIN_ to its properties no predicted tm negative _PROTEIN_ and high pi . as the overexpression of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was lethal for arabidopsis protoplasts onion epidermal cells were used as an alternative transient _PROTEIN_ system . co _PROTEIN_ of a _PROTEIN_ fusion with a tonoplast metal transporter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was performed . the merge of red and green _METHOD_ signals clearly showed a pm localization for the _PROTEIN_ protein in reference to the tonoplast targeting of the _PROTEIN_ protein . pm localization could thus be demonstrated by confocal microscopy for the five proteins chosen for further investigation even when in silico analyses did not predict a tm structure . a significant proportion of the proteins identified in the hydrophobic pm fraction are in _PROTEIN_ peripheral proteins most likely because they are more abundant than integral proteins as previously suggested by shi et al . and santoni et al . . another reason might be the specific function of the pm as a sensor of external medium and its role in cell signaling . concerning putative protein contaminants of the pm fraction members from several protein families usually described as residing in other _LOCATION_ compartments have been identified in the hydrophobic pm proteome . proteins such as the v _PROTEIN_ and the porins are classically accepted to reside in the tonoplast and in the mitochondrial _LOCATION_ respectively . however they were found here in the arabidopsis pm fraction and are reported in the pm in other _METHOD_ in particular in mammalian cells _PROTEIN_ . the presence of two _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the pm fraction _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ described in specific _LOCATION_ either reveals a true contamination due to technical _METHOD_ the peg phase driving tonoplast shreds or reflects functional interactions between pm and those particular _LOCATION_ structures . in agreement with this latter hypothesis robinson et al . also observed an immunological labeling of _PROTEIN_ proteins associated with the pm . a component of the chloroplastic cytochrome complex the rieske protein has been found here in the pm fraction . it is surprising to find this protein in the present pm proteome because no abundant chloroplastic protein was present . among the proteins identified in the course of this study only were present in protein databases . all others were only previously described at the level of either cdna or even only from genomic sequence . sequence analyses using _METHOD_ for domain predictions were used to classify the protein population . the percentage of known proteins is whereas putative and unknown proteins represent and respectively . based on sequence homologies with known proteins and on identified functional domains putative functional classes could be assigned for of the proteins . the whole set of proteins can be divided _PROTEIN_ in three large functional groups . in each group several proteins share common putative function or at least functional domains thus defining families . the unknown proteins are grouped in a fourth class . several transporters pumps and channels were identified in the hydrophobic pm fraction . among them it is not surprising to find the p type h _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the most representative integral protein of the pm . in contrast we identified the two subunits and g of the v type h _PROTEIN_ in the pm fraction although they have been described as associated with the tonoplast . such a surprising localization is in _PROTEIN_ supported by previous observations et al . identified the g subunit in tobacco pm whereas robinson et al . identified by immuno localization studies the subunit in pea pm in agreement with the localization observed in many other eukaryotic cells . in addition to such components of the proton pump the pm fraction contained the phosphate transporters _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ homologous to identified in tomato . was previously shown to be localized in pm by western blot experiments . furthermore _PROTEIN_ transporters of the _PROTEIN_ family _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are known to function as monosaccharide/h symporters through the pm . very recently the orthologue of the metal transporter _PROTEIN_ has been localized in pm . interestingly the family of _PROTEIN_ is well represented in the population of hydrophobic proteins extracted from pm as at least eight different _PROTEIN_ are present . the physiological role of _PROTEIN_ is well documented and evidence for their localization in the pm were brought for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and more recently for several _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . our study provides further evidence for the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ association of a large number of _PROTEIN_ proteins . the presence of two _PROTEIN_ in the population _PROTEIN_ found in each analyzed fraction and _PROTEIN_ found only once could result from the extraction of small specialized _LOCATION_ together with pm vesicles to which they are associated storage _LOCATION_ in the case of _PROTEIN_ and lytic _LOCATION_ for _PROTEIN_ . porins from the voltage dependent anion channel family have also been identified in the pm hydrophobic fraction . these proteins are peculiar as they show no predicted tm domain though they are integral _LOCATION_ proteins characterized by the presence of sheets forming a tm barrel structure within the _LOCATION_ . vdac proteins have been found in most of the _METHOD_ and are often described as _LOCATION_ proteins forming a pore in the outer _LOCATION_ of mitochondria and playing an essential role in apoptosis . however several studies based on electrophysiology immunological techniques and more recently on the use of chimeric proteins vdac _METHOD_ in mammalian cells demonstrated the presence of vdac proteins at the cell surface in the pm . by confocal microscopy experiments we confirm here for the first time that one vdac _PROTEIN_ identified by _METHOD_ in the pm fraction is indeed targeted to the pm in plant cells . we have identified three tm receptors among which are two protein kinases sharing identity at the protein level and belonging to the large family of the leucine rich repeats receptor kinases . these proteins were described only as mrna in databases and this work provides evidence for the existence of the two proteins and their presence at the pm . a mlo like protein another type of receptor characterized by seven tm domains is present in the pm fraction . mlo is a genetic locus for resistance to mildew in barley and the protein was identified by western blot in pm vesicles from a. thaliana . the great majority of proteins in table iii belongs to the superfamily of small _PROTEIN_ binding proteins and related proteins _PROTEIN_ which play key roles in signaling pathways and in vesicular traffic and targeting to the pm . this classification is based on the identification in the sequences of conserved domains like _PROTEIN_ ras arf or sar domains . _LOCATION_ anchoring of these proteins is a prerequisite to their activity and/or their interaction with effector proteins . their association to _LOCATION_ is mediated by post translational modifications such as prenylation palmitoylation or myristoylation . all the _PROTEIN_ binding proteins found here show a putative site of prenylation in their c terminus and the two adp ribosylation _PROTEIN_ are predicted to be myristoylated . their presence in the pm is well documented it relies on immunological evidence and more recently on subcellular localization studies using _METHOD_ fusions . several other proteins displaying a t snare domain are also associated with the pm fraction as expected from the role of that _LOCATION_ as a target for vesicular traffic . moreover the tobacco syntaxin nt _PROTEIN_ highly similar to the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ has been localized by immunogold labeling in pm . members from the _PROTEIN_ superfamily as defined by nadimpalli et al . in a study performed on maize are also present in our hydrophobic fraction . they include two prohibitins usually involved in cell proliferation and three hir proteins associated with hr cell death and resistance to pathogens . these proteins are described in the literature as containing a short tm helix in their n terminal region and in animal cells terashima et al . have already shown the pm localization of two prohibitins from b lymphocytes . one of the arabidopsis hir proteins identified here is predicted to possess one tm using the _PROTEIN_ database and the four others have a putative site of myristoylation . one of them corresponding to has been localized during the present work in the pm by _PROTEIN_ of a _METHOD_ fusion . other proteins involved in defense responses remorins are recovered in the pm fraction in good agreement with the pm localization of potato remorin reported by reymond et al . . finally we also found _PROTEIN_ in the group of signaling proteins . this pm protein acts on cell wall components in a signaling pathway affecting directed cell expansion . most of the enzymatic proteins found in the hydrophobic pm fraction are biotic and abiotic stress regulated enzymes . they are responsible for electron transfer to a large variety of _LOCATION_ associated substrates leading to _LOCATION_ antioxidant protection . this is the case for phospholipid hyperoxide glutathione peroxidases _PROTEIN_ cyt protein and fmn reductases . _PROTEIN_ proteins are _LOCATION_ bound as previously shown in rat and the _LOCATION_ targeting of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ indicates the existence of _LOCATION_ associated activity in plants too . the cyt protein has been described in microsomal _LOCATION_ from developing safflower cotyledons where it functions as an intermediate electron donor in fatty acid desaturation . the cyt isoform found in this study among at least six different _METHOD_ encoded by the arabidopsis genome was localized in the pm whereas the other _METHOD_ are found in different cell compartments . in agreement with our data fmn reductases known to participate in cell detoxication during oxidative stress have been shown to be strongly bound to the pm . cinnamoyl coa reductase displaying a _PROTEIN_ domain and glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase are also stress regulated proteins . in particular ccr genes are differentially _PROTEIN_ in response to infection by pathogenic bacteria . these proteins have no predicted tm domains . however a pm localization at least transient would be in agreement with their physiological role . the gapdh already identified in a pm proteome of arabidopsis is known in mammal cells to have a no dependent _LOCATION_ association catalyzing _LOCATION_ fusion . superoxide dismutase and one enzyme from the pentose phosphate pathway d ribulose phosphate epimerase _PROTEIN_ were also found in our fraction . the pm associated _PROTEIN_ displays identity with the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ reported by kopriva et al . . again those are enzymes involved in oxidative stress responses at the _LOCATION_ level in mammals yeast and also plants . phosphoribosyltransferases _PROTEIN_ and phosphatidate phosphatases are both involved in second messenger synthesis but their localization is still controversial . investigating the respective contributions of three _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ of arabidopsis to adenine and cytokinin metabolism allen et al . provided evidence for the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins but could not conclude on the localization of _PROTEIN_ . we propose that the isoform we identified _PROTEIN_ might be pm associated . the lpp _PROTEIN_ identified here corresponds to _PROTEIN_ thus suggesting the presence of this protein in the pm . this is in agreement with the localization attributed to the animal phosphatidate phosphohydrolase _PROTEIN_ type from _PROTEIN_ thymus or _PROTEIN_ from rat lung . database analyses reveal that more than of the proteins identified in this work are considered as unknown proteins which have no match with proteins of already known functions in other _METHOD_ . about though unknown possess functional domains allowing their classification in the categories described above . this is the case for _PROTEIN_ proteins displaying t snare domains and likely participating in the secretory pathway . the unknown proteins left are gathered in citation . among these initially referred to as emap is the only gene product that had been previously identified as a protein and localized at the pm like its tobacco orthologue . moreover its localization to the pm was further confirmed by our confocal microscopy experiments with emap _METHOD_ fusion protein . proteins belonging to four families identified on the basis of the presence of conserved domains _LOCATION_ were present in our fraction . this suggests that these families might be specific for the pm although their functions still remain unknown .
a. thaliana cells were cultured in complete medium under controlled conditions continuous light and rotations per minute . cells were collected after days of culture during the exponential phase . a microsomal fraction was obtained after grinding the cells and applying a series of differential centrifugations . a pm enriched fraction was purified from microsomes by the two phase partitioning between polyethyleneglycol and dextran . in this condition the peg upper phase is enriched in pm vesicles though the dextran lower phase named endomembrane fraction contains all other _LOCATION_ . to eliminate contamination of the pm fraction with peg the pm fraction was again partitioned in a two phases partition system consisting of m peg/k ph . in this system pm is recovered in the saline lower phase . after an ultracentrifugation pm is recovered in the pellet . proteins were resuspended in mm morpholinepropanesulfonic acid /naoh ph mm dithiothreitol . protein amounts were estimated using bradford procedure and the proteins were concentrated at mg/ml . the sensitivity of the _PROTEIN_ activity to vanadate and _PROTEIN_ was used as a marker of pm and tonoplast respectively . cytochrome c oxidase activity was used as a marker of mitochondria . hydrophobic proteins were extracted from the purified pm fraction using a c/m treatment as described by seigneurin berny et al . . for the standard conditions ml of pm fraction was slowly diluted in ml of cold c/m solution . the resulting mixture was stored for min on ice before centrifugation for min at g. insoluble proteins in the organic phase were recovered as a white pellet at the bottom of the tube . the organic phase which contains the proteins soluble in c/m solutions was removed for further protein analyses . c/m soluble proteins were dried under nitrogen precipitated with acetone resuspended in of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ buffer and stored at . before _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ separation the proteins were solubilized at in laemmli buffer . to analyze the effect of ph on the extraction efficiency a mm napi ph buffer was used instead of the classical mm mops/naoh ph . to increase the diversity of extracted proteins in some experiments the pm fraction was pretreated by triton x . after centrifugation the pellet and the supernatant were resuspended independently in the same volume and in the same buffer leading to two subfractions soluble and insoluble triton _PROTEIN_ . in that case both _PROTEIN_ and it were used for c/m extraction . denaturation at before the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was also tested some proteins being damaged at . the pm proteins were diluted in ml of solubilization solution containing either triton x or m naoh . after min incubation on ice the mixture was centrifuged to separate two fractions the supernatant containing proteins solubilized by the treatment and the pellet containing the insoluble proteins . the pellet proteins were then suspended in of the initial solubilization solution and both fractions were analyzed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as described above for c/m extracts . the different samples were separated on or acrylamide gels for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ analyses . both gels and migration buffers contained _PROTEIN_ . for some analyses protein migration was stopped just between the stacking and the separating gels so that proteins were concentrated on a very thin band for further nanolc _METHOD_ analyses . western blot analyses were performed after _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ analysis of cell subfractions as described by _PROTEIN_ et al . each fraction contained of proteins . western blot experiments were performed with markers of different _LOCATION_ compartments . the anti h _PROTEIN_ antibody is raised against the pm h _PROTEIN_ of nicotiana plumbaginifolia . the anti e antibody is raised against a protein from the inner envelope _LOCATION_ of spinach chloroplast . the anti tonoplast intrinsic protein _PROTEIN_ antibody is directed against a tobacco tonoplast protein . the anti nad antibody is raised against an extrinsic protein of the wheat mitochondrial inner _LOCATION_ and the anti tom antibody recognizes an outer _LOCATION_ protein of yeast mitochondria . these antibodies were detected using alkaline phosphatase staining . the corresponding pre immune sera were tested and gave no signal on blots . the in gel digestion was carried out as previously described . briefly after separation by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ individual bands were excised from the _METHOD_ blue stained gel and washed with acetonitrile and mm . gel pieces were dried in a vacuum centrifuge and reswollen in of mm containing of trypsin . after h incubation at a aliquot was removed for maldi tof analysis and spotted onto the maldi sample probe on top of a dried mixture of volumes solution of saturated cyano hydroxy trans cinnamic acid in acetone and volumes of nitrocellulose dissolved in acetone/isopropanol . samples were rinsed by placing a volume of trifluoroacetic acid on the _PROTEIN_ surface after the analyte solution had dried completely . after min the liquid was blown off by pressurized air . tryptic digests were then subjected to maldi _METHOD_ analysis on an autoflex instrument in order to obtain peptide _METHOD_ fingerprints . for protein identification purposes _METHOD_ spectrometric data were searched using the _METHOD_ fit or the mascot softwares . searching parameters were as follows one missed cleavage ppm _METHOD_ accuracy six peptides allowed . for hits that did not fit with the tolerated _METHOD_ accuracy and the occurrence of six peptides per protein protein identification was achieved by _METHOD_ analysis . for esi _METHOD_ analyses after in gel tryptic digestion the gel pieces were then extracted with formic acid solution and acetonitrile . the extracts were combined with the original digest and the sample was evaporated to dryness in vacuum centrifuge . the residues were dissolved in formic acid and desalted by using zip tips . elution of the peptides was performed with of a acid solution . the peptide solution was introduced into a glass capillary for nanoesi . _METHOD_ experiments were carried out on a quadrupole tof hybrid _METHOD_ spectrometer _METHOD_ . interpretation of _METHOD_ spectra was achieved manually and with the help of the _PROTEIN_ program _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ sequence information was used for database searching by using either blast or _METHOD_ pattern _METHOD_ . for the lc _METHOD_ after the in gel digestion gel the pieces were then extracted with formic acid solution and acetonitrile . after drying tryptic peptides were resuspended in aqueous trifluoroacetic acid . the samples were injected into a lc packings or a caplc nanolc system and first preconcentrated on a mm pepmap precolumn . the peptides were then eluted onto a column . the chromatographic separation used a gradient from solution a to solution b over min at a flow rate of nl/min . the lc system was directly coupled to or qtof ultima _METHOD_ spectrometer . _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ data were acquired and processed automatically using _METHOD_ software . database searching was carried out using the mascot program available via internet . the parameters for mascot searches were as followed two missed cleavages and da _METHOD_ accuracy allowed for parent and the fragment ions respectively _PROTEIN_ as fixed modification oxidized methionine acetylation of the peptide or the n terminus as variable modifications hits allowed . proteins that were identified with at least two peptides showing both a score higher than were validated without any manual validation . for proteins identified by only one peptide having a score higher than the peptide sequence was systematically checked manually . peptides with scores higher than and lower than were systematically checked and/or interpreted manually to confirm or cancel the mascot suggestion . the remaining unassigned peptides were interpreted manually and internet _METHOD_ pattern and blast were used for database searching . all databases searches were performed using both a generic database or swiss prot trembl databases no species specified and a. thaliana database databases . predictions for _LOCATION_ spanning regions were achieved by using the _PROTEIN_ database . the _PROTEIN_ was obtained using the software program protparam tool . the same software program was used to analyze the other parameters _METHOD_ . the presence of conserved domain in all proteins was searched on the ncbi conserved domain database . cdd currently contains domains derived from two commonly used collections smart and pfam plus contributions from colleagues at ncbi such as _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plasmids were kindly provided by s. thomine . cdnas encoding translational fusions between or and the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ rssm _METHOD_ were constructed as follows . to remove the stop codon and introduce bamhi and xbai restriction sites cdna was amplified with the oligonucleotides xba _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and bam _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . cdna was amplified with the oligonucleotides xba _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and bam _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . and were subsequently cloned in the bamhi and xbai sites in the plant transient _PROTEIN_ vector _METHOD_ to generate a fusion with the _METHOD_ as an additional c terminal domain under the control of the camv promoter . to construct a cdna encoding a translational fusion between _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ cdna was amplified with the oligonucleotides xba _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and kp _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which remove the stop codon and introduce xbai and kpni restriction sites . _PROTEIN_ was subsequently cloned at the spei and kpni sites in the plant transient _PROTEIN_ vector pol to generate a fusion with the as an additional c terminal domain under the control of a double camv promoter . to construct a cdna encoding a translational fusion between cytochrome and the cyt cdna was amplified with the oligonucleotides _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which remove the stop codon and introduce recombination sites . cyt was cloned in r green vector modified by the technology to generate a fusion with the as an additional c terminal domain under the control of the camv promoter . the _PROTEIN_ the and the _METHOD_ fusion constructs and the cyt fusion construct were transiently _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts from arabidopsis cell suspensions . the _PROTEIN_ construct and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions were transiently _PROTEIN_ in onion epidermal cells by biolistic bombardment . for onion cell bombardment gold microcarriers coated with plasmid dna were bombarded on onion scales at a distance of cm using the pneumatic particle gun _PROTEIN_ instrument with psi he pressure under in . hg vacuum . after bombardment the onion scales were incubated in a petri dish under high humidity in the dark at . after h epidermal peels were detached from the onion scales and mounted in water for microscopic observation . protoplasts were isolated from arabidopsis cell suspensions and protein fusions were transiently _PROTEIN_ in the protoplasts by peg mediated transformation as described in thomine et al . . briefly arabidopsis suspension cells were digested in gamborg s medium supplemented with m _PROTEIN_ m mannitol cellulase and macerozyme . the protoplasts were purified by floatation in gamborg s medium supplemented with m sucrose . for transformation protoplasts were mixed with of plasmid dna in a solution containing peg m mannitol m ca ph and incubated in the dark for min . then the peg was washed twice with m ca and the protoplasts were re suspended in gamborg s medium supplemented with m _PROTEIN_ m mannitol and _PROTEIN_ in this medium until microscopic observation . _METHOD_ cells were imaged by confocal microscopy upon excitation by an argon laser at nm the _METHOD_ emission signal of _METHOD_ was recovered between and nm . upon excitation by a helium neon laser at nm the emission signal was recovered between and nm for . in co localization experiments the wavelength windows for collecting the two _METHOD_ signals at the same time were narrowed in order to avoid any emission of one _METHOD_ protein into the observation range of the other one .
