plants perceive subtle changes in light quality and quantity through a set of photoreceptors including phytochromes and cryptochromes . upon perception these photoreceptors initiate signal transduction pathways leading to photomorphogenic changes in development . using activation tagging mutagenesis to identify novel light signaling components we have isolated a gain of function mutant d _PROTEIN_ which suppresses the long hypocotyl phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ missense allele _PROTEIN_ . the d mutant phenotype is caused by the overexpression of a dof transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ binding protein _PROTEIN_ . a translational fusion between _PROTEIN_ and green _METHOD_ protein is _LOCATION_ localized in onion cells . tissue specific accumulation of an _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ translational fusion is regulated by light in arabidopsis thaliana . hypocotyls of transgenic lines with reduced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are less responsive to red light . this aberrant phenotype in red light requires functional _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is a positive regulator of _PROTEIN_ mediated inhibition of hypocotyl elongation . furthermore these partial loss of function lines have larger cotyledons . this light dependent cotyledon phenotype is most dramatic in blue light and requires functional cryptochrome _PROTEIN_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ is a negative regulator of _PROTEIN_ mediated cotyledon expansion . these results suggest a model where _PROTEIN_ is a component in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ signaling pathways acting as a positive and negative regulator respectively . an alternate though not mutually exclusive model places _PROTEIN_ as a general inhibitor of tissue expansion with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ differentially modulating _PROTEIN_ 's role in this response .
the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ mutation caused by a single amino acid change near the chromophore binding site confers a long hypocotyl phenotype when compared with the wild type . in an activation tagging mutagenesis of primary transformants we identified and cloned the genes causing four independent gain of function mutations that suppress the long hypocotyl phenotype of _PROTEIN_ . this study focuses on one of these mutants identified in our lab d. the d _PROTEIN_ double mutant had a dramatically shorter hypocotyl than the _PROTEIN_ mutant and the wild type when grown in white light . however the double mutant elongated normally in the dark suggesting that the gene altered in this mutant is involved in light signaling . both the d _PROTEIN_ double mutant and d single mutant were severe dwarfs with reduced fertility as adults . dna gel blot and segregation analysis indicated that there was one t dna in the d _PROTEIN_ mutant and it was genetically linked to the mutant phenotype . genomic dna flanking the t dna insertion was cloned via plasmid rescue . sequencing and subsequent blast analysis of a portion of the cloned dna indicated that the t dna was inserted into chromosome iii . the closest open reading frame is kb from the left border of the t dna . sequencing and pcr analysis confirmed that all four copies of the enhancers were inserted bp of the stop codon of a dof transcription _PROTEIN_ previously named _PROTEIN_ . rt pcr demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ is overexpressed in the d _PROTEIN_ mutant . to confirm that _PROTEIN_ overexpression causes the d mutant phenotype the _PROTEIN_ mutant was transformed with genomic dna encoding _PROTEIN_ along with the four enhancers . transgenic lines with increased _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ recapitulated the original d mutant phenotypes indicating that the overexpression of _PROTEIN_ is responsible for suppressing the long hypocotyl phenotype of _PROTEIN_ in the d _PROTEIN_ double mutant . based on sequence similarity _PROTEIN_ is a putative dof transcription _PROTEIN_ . in addition an _PROTEIN_ protein lacking amino acids from the n terminus though containing the dof domain is capable of binding dna in vitro and activating transcription in a transient assay . however _PROTEIN_ 's subcellular localization is unknown . to determine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ the same _PROTEIN_ cdna used by citation was translationally fused to green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . this construct was cobombarded into onion epidermal cells along with a construct containing dsred under control of the zea mays ubiquitin promoter . this dsred control localized throughout the cell including within the _LOCATION_ in a manner similar to constitutively _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . however the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was only _LOCATION_ localized in these onion epidermal cells . _PROTEIN_ 's _LOCATION_ localization along with its ability to bind dna and activate transcription suggests that this gene encodes a bona fide dof transcription _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ mrna levels were not altered in seedlings grown in continuous light or in the dark . in addition _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were unaffected by the fluence rate or wavelength of light or during the transition from darkness to growth in the light . however many transcription _PROTEIN_ involved in light signaling are regulated at the protein level . to determine the relative amount and localization of _PROTEIN_ in response to changes in light wild type arabidopsis was transformed with a construct encoding an _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ translational fusion protein consisting of the genomic dna encoding _PROTEIN_ fused at the end to gus . this fusion was _PROTEIN_ using kb of dna of the _PROTEIN_ open reading frame . multiple homozygous lines containing a single locus insertion had varying degrees of d mutant phenotypes . these phenotypes correlated with _PROTEIN_ gus mrna levels suggesting that the fusion protein is functional . gus analysis was performed on at least three independent lines grown for d in the dark or in continuous white light . gus staining was present in the apex cotyledons and occasionally in the root apex of dark grown seedlings . in light grown seedlings gus staining was present in the shoot apex and the vascular tissue of the cotyledons hypocotyl and roots . taken together these data indicate that light causes _PROTEIN_ to accumulate in the vascular tissue of hypocotyls and roots and possibly cotyledons . this localization was independent of the fluence rate of light . seedlings grown in continuous red or blue light showed similar staining patterns to white light grown seedlings . seedlings grown in far red light had staining only in the apex and cotyledons similar to dark grown seedlings . the d _PROTEIN_ mutant suppressed the long hypocotyl phenotype of _PROTEIN_ in the light while elongating normally in the dark suggesting that _PROTEIN_ may be involved in light signaling . because no null mutations in _PROTEIN_ exist to date _PROTEIN_ partial loss of function transgenic lines were generated using rna interference to further test the role of _PROTEIN_ in photomorphogenesis . a bp region containing a portion of the final _PROTEIN_ exon and untranslated region was amplified by pcr and cloned into a binary vector in a hairpin manner under the control of the promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus . this region did not contain the highly conserved dof domain and blast analysis indicated no homology to other sequences in the arabidopsis genome . some of the resulting homozygous _PROTEIN_ rnai lines conferred larger adult stature . rt pcr was performed on these plants to determine if they had lower _PROTEIN_ transcript levels . those lines with larger adult stature had lower _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in addition transgenic lines with normal adult stature had normal _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels . one of these original lines _PROTEIN_ was crossed with the d _PROTEIN_ mutant resulting in progeny with a hypocotyl phenotype similar to the wild type . this provides further evidence that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is reduced in the _PROTEIN_ rnai lines because the rnai phenotype is dominant with _PROTEIN_ to the overexpression phenotype . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ is involved in light signal transduction fluence rate response experiments were performed using the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ line . like the d mutant _PROTEIN_ and other _PROTEIN_ rnai lines elongated normally in the dark . in multiple fluence rates of white light _PROTEIN_ conferred a subtle though statistically significant long hypocotyl phenotype when compared with the wild type suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is involved in light signaling . multiple _PROTEIN_ rnai lines including _PROTEIN_ were also less responsive to multiple fluence rates of red light when compared with the wild type . multiple _PROTEIN_ rnai lines including _PROTEIN_ responded normally to far red light . though hypocotyls of the _PROTEIN_ line were shorter in blue light this phenotype was not conferred by other _PROTEIN_ rnai lines . together these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ is a positive regulator of hypocotyl elongation inhibition in red and white light . to determine if _PROTEIN_ is necessary for this _PROTEIN_ mediated hypocotyl response in red light double mutants between _PROTEIN_ and weak and null alleles of _PROTEIN_ were generated . although _PROTEIN_ null mutants grown in red light are near their maximal growth rate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutants are capable of elongating more than _PROTEIN_ null mutants suggesting that this genetic test will determine if _PROTEIN_ is required for the _PROTEIN_ mediated hypocotyl response . the _PROTEIN_ hypocotyls were less responsive to red light only when wild type or partially functional _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was present . by contrast the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ null _PROTEIN_ double mutant hypocotyls responded the same way to red light as the _PROTEIN_ mutant . this experiment was repeated in a lower fluence rate of red light and gave the same result demonstrating that the _PROTEIN_ aberrant hypocotyl response to red light requires _PROTEIN_ . because _PROTEIN_ transcript accumulation was not affected by the genetic state of _PROTEIN_ these results demonstrate that this transcription _PROTEIN_ is a positive regulator of _PROTEIN_ mediated hypocotyl elongation inhibition in response to red light . the d _PROTEIN_ double mutant had smaller upwardly cupped cotyledons when grown in white light . because the d mutant was a severe dwarf as an adult it was predicted that _PROTEIN_ rnai adult plants would be larger in stature . in addition to this larger adult stature multiple _PROTEIN_ rnai mutants had larger cotyledons when grown in white light . to determine if this increase in cotyledon size is because of cell expansion or cell division epidermal imprints were examined and cell area was measured . the d _PROTEIN_ mutant cotyledons had smaller epidermal cells when compared with both the _PROTEIN_ mutant and the wild type . _PROTEIN_ and other _PROTEIN_ rnai lines had larger epidermal cells when compared with the wild type . cotyledon epidermal cell area to determine if _PROTEIN_ mediated cotyledon expansion involves specific photoreceptor signaling pathways multiple _PROTEIN_ rnai lines including _PROTEIN_ were grown in different wavelengths of light and the cotyledon area was measured . cotyledons of the _PROTEIN_ rnai lines were dramatically larger than the wild type in blue light and slightly though significantly larger in red and far red light . taken together these data demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is a negative regulator of cotyledon expansion in multiple photomorphogenic signaling pathways . the most striking _PROTEIN_ rnai cotyledon phenotype was seen in blue light suggesting a role for _PROTEIN_ in this response . to determine if _PROTEIN_ is necessary for the aberrant cotyledon response conferred by _PROTEIN_ in blue light double mutants were generated with weak and null alleles of _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ weak _PROTEIN_ double mutant had significantly larger cotyledons than _PROTEIN_ . by contrast cotyledons of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ null _PROTEIN_ double mutant were the same size as the _PROTEIN_ mutant . thus _PROTEIN_ mediated cotyledon expansion in response to blue light was observed only when wild type or partially functional _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was present . because _PROTEIN_ transcript accumulation was not affected by the genetic state of _PROTEIN_ these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ is a negative regulator of _PROTEIN_ mediated cotyledon cell expansion in response to blue light .
