l myo inositol phosphate synthase catalyzes the rate limiting step in the synthesis of myo inositol a critical compound in the cell . plants contain multiple mips genes which encode highly similar enzymes . we characterized the _PROTEIN_ patterns of the three mips genes in arabidopsis thaliana and found that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in most cell types and developmental stages while _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ restricted to vascular or related tissues . _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ is required for seed development for physiological responses to salt and abscisic acid and to suppress cell death . specifically a loss in _PROTEIN_ resulted in smaller plants with curly leaves and spontaneous production of lesions . the _PROTEIN_ mutants have lower myo inositol ascorbic acid and phosphatidylinositol levels while basal levels of inositol are not altered in _PROTEIN_ mutants . furthermore _PROTEIN_ mutants exhibited elevated levels of ceramides sphingolipid precursors associated with cell death and were complemented by a _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion construct . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ each localized to the cytoplasm . thus _PROTEIN_ has a significant impact on myo inositol levels that is critical for _PROTEIN_ levels of ascorbic acid phosphatidylinositol and ceramides that regulate growth development and cell death .
the arabidopsis genome contains three genes encoding mips enzyme _METHOD_ that are to identical to one another at the amino acid level . to determine whether the mips genes are differentially regulated we performed quantitative rt pcr to compare relative _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in various tissues . we found that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in all tissues examined and levels are higher as compared with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in all tissues except for roots and seeds . in roots _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is highest and in seeds _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is highest . our data for siliques are similar to those reported previously that found _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in addition our patterns are in keeping with those reported from microarray data in genevestigator and atgenexpress visualization . overall these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is mostly constitutive while low levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are found in all tissues with highest _PROTEIN_ in siliques and seeds _PROTEIN_ and roots _PROTEIN_ . to investigate the spatial pattern of regulation of the mips genes we generated transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ promoters fused to the uida gene . two independent transgenic lines for each promips uida construct were analyzed and consistent patterns were detected . in uida d old seedlings _PROTEIN_ activity was noted along the edges of cotyledons and in root tips . by contrast _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ in different areas of d old seedlings . specifically uida seedlings have gus activity in the hypocotyl only while uida seedlings have gus activity in the hydathodes and vascular tissue in the shoot apex and at the hypocotyl/root junction . these discrete domains of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ specific patterns are _PROTEIN_ in d old seedlings . in d old seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ has increased along the edges of cotyledons and is present in developing leaf primordia root tips and in a small area near the hypocotyl/root junction . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ at d is _PROTEIN_ in the hypocotyl and _PROTEIN_ in the tips of leaf primordia and _PROTEIN_ is evident . at d _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ has become evident throughout all shoot vascular tissue and in hydathodes and trichomes . _PROTEIN_ is also _PROTEIN_ in portions of the root vascular tissue especially near _PROTEIN_ roots . gus activity in d old plants also reveals spatial restriction of the mips genes . in d old plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ throughout all cells in young rosette leaves but is restricted to vascular tissue in older leaves . _PROTEIN_ by contrast is only _PROTEIN_ in hydathodes and vascular tissue of d old plants while _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is confined to vascular tissue and hydathodes of leaves . examination of leaves from flowering plants grown on soil indicates that _PROTEIN_ is confined to the proximal portion of the leaf _PROTEIN_ is confined to the hydathodes and distal portion of leaves and _PROTEIN_ is confined to the vascular tissue . in flowers both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ in the pistil and in the stamen filaments while _PROTEIN_ is confined to vascular tissue in the sepals . all three mips genes show _PROTEIN_ in the tips and abscission zones of immature siliques and no _PROTEIN_ in mature siliques . together these data indicate that the mips genes are both developmentally and spatially regulated which may provide spatial regulation of myo inositol synthesis . specifically while all three mips genes are _PROTEIN_ to various degrees in vascular tissues _PROTEIN_ is the only isoform _PROTEIN_ outside of vascular tissues beyond the seedling stage . to examine accumulation of mips proteins in plant extracts we produced polyclonal antisera within rabbits using a soybean his tagged mips fusion protein as the immunogen . the resulting anti mips antisera recognizes the recombinant soybean his tagged mips protein produced in escherichia coli as well as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusions _PROTEIN_ in transgenic plants . thus our anti mips antisera are useful for detecting all three arabidopsis mips proteins . in wild type arabidopsis extracts we detected two immunoreactive bands . the upper band corresponds well to the predicted size of _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and proteins from arabidopsis while the lower band has been predicted by others to represent a chloroplastic mips produced by differential splicing . the larger mips _METHOD_ are most abundant in week old seedlings and flowers with less abundant _PROTEIN_ present in older seedlings siliques leaves and bolts . the smaller immunoreactive band was detectable in all tissues from light grown plants examined with _PROTEIN_ highest in seedlings and bolts . we tried to resolve the three mips protein _METHOD_ with native gels but have not been successful in separating these three very similar proteins with gel electrophoresis . to determine how the different mips genes impact inositol synthesis and plant growth and development t dna insertion mutants were obtained from the salk t dna insertion collection . seed for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were obtained and homozygous mutants were verified by diagnostic pcr screening and dna sequencing as described in the supplemental methods online . mips gene _PROTEIN_ was verified in the mutants by quantitative rt pcr . our data indicate a large reduction of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ while _PROTEIN_ still retains of wild type _PROTEIN_ indicating that the _PROTEIN_ mutant is a partial loss of function mutant . interestingly _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is increased in both of these _PROTEIN_ mutants and the _PROTEIN_ mutant also contains elevated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . our analyses of _PROTEIN_ mutants showed that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants retain little if any _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and both can be considered loss of function mutants . the _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ very little _PROTEIN_ while the _PROTEIN_ mutant we characterized has wild type levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . from this analysis we conclude that these mutants are suitable for examining the consequences of eliminating _PROTEIN_ of specific mips _METHOD_ . we also tried to examine whether _PROTEIN_ and proteins were reduced in the mips mutants . using the previously described anti mips antibody we could not effectively separate and identify the endogenous mips protein _METHOD_ using _PROTEIN_ or native _PROTEIN_ followed by protein gel blotting of d old plants in leaves seedlings or flowers . thus we can not draw any conclusions about mips protein levels in the mips mutants . the widespread _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in many different cell types suggested that _PROTEIN_ catalyzes the majority of myo inositol synthesis required for different aspects of plant growth and development . we compared the growth and development of mips mutants and noted seed phenotypes in _PROTEIN_ mutants . seeds of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have a significant percentage of wrinkled and empty seeds compared with their corresponding wild type accessions . by contrast there was no difference in seed production with _PROTEIN_ containing seed/siliques compared with seed/siliques in its wild type accession . similarly _PROTEIN_ had seed/siliques compared with its wild type with . both the wrinkled and empty seed phenotypes can be complemented in the _PROTEIN_ background with a wild type copy of the _PROTEIN_ gene fused to _METHOD_ indicating the functionality of the transgene and confirming that the phenotype was due to the loss of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the wild type background _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not affect the development or morphology of the seeds . after germination of mips mutant seeds we noted significant differences in _PROTEIN_ seedling development that were not present in _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutants . homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutants were overall smaller than the wild type . cotyledons from _PROTEIN_ mutants had irregular margins altered vascular patterning and contained necrotic lesions . these phenotypes are similar to those recently noted for _PROTEIN_ mutants . cleared cotyledons were observed by microscopy and found to contain areas of smaller unexpanded cells that could result in the irregular margins . veins in _PROTEIN_ cotyledons did not close properly resulting in open veins . in addition _PROTEIN_ cotyledons sometimes contained areas of extra vascular tissue . the _PROTEIN_ in size and presence of lesions in _PROTEIN_ mutants remained apparent throughout development while _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants showed no variation from the wild type . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ complemented the growth and cotyledon and lesion phenotypes indicating that these phenotypes are due to loss of the _PROTEIN_ gene . we next investigated the lesions on _PROTEIN_ mutant cotyledons and leaves and potential _PROTEIN_ that could contribute to their presence . we used trypan blue staining to determine that the lesions on _PROTEIN_ mutant leaves and cotyledons were comprised of dead cells . since reactive oxygen species and light are _PROTEIN_ stimulating lesion development in other lesion mimic mutants we investigated whether _PROTEIN_ mutants were more sensitive to the herbicide paraquat a redox active compound that generates superoxide anion and stimulates lesion development in wild type plants . when d old plants were treated with paraquat _PROTEIN_ mutants developed more lesions per leaf than the wild type or _PROTEIN_ mutants indicating increased sensitivity to paraquat when _PROTEIN_ is lacking . lesion development in _PROTEIN_ mutants was also affected by the intensity of light as noted previously with high light promoting faster development of lesions in _PROTEIN_ mutants . lastly we attempted to chemically rescue the development of lesions in _PROTEIN_ mutants by watering mutants and wild type plants with either myo inositol or other polyols such as mannitol or sorbitol . the results show that continuous watering with mm myo inositol but not mm mannitol or sorbitol alleviated the growth and lesion promoting effects of the _PROTEIN_ mutation . we conclude that ros light and myo inositol are each involved in the aberrant development of lesions in the _PROTEIN_ mutants . we have previously shown that a loss of function in another gene required for myo inositol synthesis vitamin c _PROTEIN_ results in sensitivity to abscisic acid salt and cold . to test whether known stress physiological pathways that use myo inositol signaling were altered in mips mutants we produced age matched seed populations that had been harvested from plants grown at the same time . control and mutant age matched seeds were plated on murashige and skoog _METHOD_ medium in the presence of various concentrations of aba nacl or mannitol and stratified for d at . germination was scored and seedling root lengths were measured . our results indicate that _PROTEIN_ mutants germinate slower under control conditions and also have increased sensitivity to aba during seed germination and in root growth . by contrast _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants are not significantly altered in their response to aba in either assay . _PROTEIN_ mutants are also sensitive to nacl and sorbitol as measured in both germination and root growth assays . this is in contrast with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants which do not differ in their responses to nacl and sorbitol compared with the wild type . together these experiments indicate that _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutants have impaired germination and root growth in response to aba nacl and mannitol which is indicative of stress sensitivity . to determine if a loss in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ function impacts myo inositol synthesis we used our previously established gas chromatography assay to quantify myo inositol levels in the wild type and mips mutants . to investigate the timing of myo inositol changes in mips mutants we analyzed leaves of and d old wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . our results indicate that loss of _PROTEIN_ has a larger impact on myo inositol levels in leaves than loss of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . in addition the _PROTEIN_ mutant has the largest decline in myo inositol at the d time point which corresponds well with the development of lesions and other growth defects in this mutant . evidence exists that a minor pathway to ascorbic acid synthesis could proceed via myo inositol synthesis . we have previously shown that the _PROTEIN_ mutant has reduced myo inositol and ascorbic acid levels suggesting such a connection between these pathways . thus we quantified ascorbic acid in leaves from d old _PROTEIN_ mutants and found tissue in the wild type compared with tissue in _PROTEIN_ mutants . we further profiled myo inositol ascorbic acid and d _PROTEIN_ in the wild type _PROTEIN_ mutants complemented _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overexpressors . these data show that the changes in myo inositol ascorbic acid and d _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ plants is complemented by a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct resulting in wild type levels for each of these compounds . this indicates that these metabolite alterations are due to a loss of _PROTEIN_ function . we also examined metabolite levels in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants and found wild type levels for each metabolite except for myo inositol which was increased by almost fold . the ascorbic acid precursor l galactonic acid lactone was also measured and we found an almost fivefold increase in _PROTEIN_ mutants compared with the wild type complemented mutants and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants . we next investigated whether the reduction in myo inositol in _PROTEIN_ mutants resulted in alterations in ins second messenger levels . for this work we used a purified bovine ins receptor in radiolabeled competition binding assays that are well established and used by several plant laboratories . we found no differences with d old wild type plants having pg ins tissue and d old _PROTEIN_ plants having pg ins tissue . in addition plants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct which resulted in a fold increase in myo inositol levels did not contain significantly altered ins levels . our data indicate that there is no change in basal ins in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . to determine if phospholipids are affected in _PROTEIN_ mutants we analyzed the phospholipid profile of d old _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants . analysis of lipid extracts by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ indicated a significant in several different ptdins molecules in _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type . complemented _PROTEIN_ plants contained intermediate levels of ptdins but these differed significantly from wild type levels for only the and species . this indicates that _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene did not fully restore these two ptdins species in complemented _PROTEIN_ mutants . however since these two species are present in minor amounts the total ptdins levels in complemented plants does not differ significantly from those in wild type plants _PROTEIN_ . interestingly overexpression of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which increased myo inositol levels by fold did not result in a corresponding increase in ptdins however phosphatidylcholine levels were significantly increased for some species . this suggests that levels of ptdins are tightly regulated in plants . in contrast with the impact on ptdins levels of other measured phospholipids were not significantly altered in _PROTEIN_ plants . we conclude that the reduction in myo inositol in _PROTEIN_ mutants is accompanied by a _PROTEIN_ in ptdins which could impact functions that require ptdins . ptdins is used during sphingolipid synthesis in plants . it has been shown that the plant inositol phosphorylceramide synthase catalyzes the transfer of the inositol phosphate headgroup from ptdins to ceramide resulting in inositol phosphorylceramide . inositol phosphorylceramide synthase mutants _PROTEIN_ the resistance gene resistance to powdery have enhanced cell death and elevated ceramide and hydroxyceramide levels . to test whether the cell death in _PROTEIN_ mutants is associated with altered ceramide and/or more complex sphingolipid levels we measured total amounts of sphingolipids from d old plants . total ceramides and hydroxyceramides were significantly elevated in _PROTEIN_ mutants but not in complemented or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants . in addition there were no significant differences in other sphingolipids in _PROTEIN_ mutants . we conclude that the elevated levels of ceramides and hydroxyceramides correlate with the decline of myo inositol and ptdins and the occurrence of cell death in _PROTEIN_ mutants . to determine if the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes encode enzymes with different kinetic properties we _PROTEIN_ recombinant versions of all three mips proteins containing an n terminal his tag in e. coli and purified these proteins using immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography . the catalytic activity of the recombinant mips proteins was measured under steady state conditions . it was determined that mips activity was enhanced by glycerol and mm as previously observed for characterized mips enzymes . therefore and glycerol were included in our standard assay buffer . the dependence of mips activity on the concentration of the substrate glc p and cofactor nad was measured and the michaelis menten equation was fit to the initial rates to obtain the steady state parameters . the results from these experiments show that there is no significant difference in the steady state parameters for the recombinant mips enzymes . thus we conclude that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ enzymes are likely to act in a similar fashion in vivo . steady state kinetic parameters for arabidopsis mips to investigate the subcellular location of mips proteins we performed imaging experiments on _PROTEIN_ mutants complemented with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and wild type plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . as the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct we used allowed for complementation of all phenotypes in _PROTEIN_ mutants it is likely that this fusion protein undergoes the same posttranslational modifications and subcellular localization as the native _PROTEIN_ protein . we analyzed progeny from two different complemented lines with confocal microscopy and found a similar pattern in these lines and in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overexpressors . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was predominantly associated with the cytoplasm in d old light grown seedling epidermis roots and hypocotyls . to determine if the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein was associated with the cell wall d old light grown seedlings were treated with mm nacl to stimulate plasmolysis . in plasmolyzed cells _METHOD_ _METHOD_ retracted from the cell wall consistent with a cytoplasmic location . we also used a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ dye with dual imaging to determine if any _METHOD_ was associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . since no _METHOD_ was seen to colocalize with we conclude that _PROTEIN_ is most likely located exclusively in the cytoplasm . in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ seedlings _METHOD_ was highest in guard cells and appeared to be confined to the cytoplasm as judged from plasmolysis experiments . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulation was apparent in the cytoplasm of epidermal and root cells and this localization was confirmed in plasmolysis experiments . we conclude that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins accumulate in a manner consistent with a similar cytoplasmic location for each .
