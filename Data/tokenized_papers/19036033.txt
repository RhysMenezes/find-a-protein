a variety of approaches were used to predict dual targeted proteins in arabidopsis thaliana . these predictions were experimentally tested using _METHOD_ fusions . twelve new dual targeted proteins were identified five that were dual targeted to mitochondria and _LOCATION_ six that were dual targeted to mitochondria and _LOCATION_ and one that was dual targeted to mitochondria and the _LOCATION_ . two methods to predict dual targeted proteins had a high success rate combining the araperox database with a variety of subcellular prediction _METHOD_ to identify mitochondrial and peroxisomal targeted proteins and using a variety of prediction _METHOD_ on a biochemical pathway or process known to contain at least one dual targeted protein . several technical parameters need to be taken into account before assigning subcellular localization using _METHOD_ fusion proteins . the position of _METHOD_ with respect to the tagged polypeptide the tissue or cells used to detect subcellular localization and the portion of a candidate protein fused to _METHOD_ are all relevant to the _PROTEIN_ and targeting of a fusion protein . testing all gene models for a chromosomal locus is required if more than one model exists .
various approaches were used to computationally predict dual targeted proteins in arabidopsis . to predict dual targeting to mitochondria and _LOCATION_ we used the neural network based program predotar . the predotar networks were not trained using any dual targeted proteins and thus the mitochondrial and _LOCATION_ scores from the networks tend to be antagonistic . indeed the majority of known dual targeted _LOCATION_ plant proteins are predicted as uniquely _LOCATION_ by predotar . therefore the complete set of annotated arabidopsis protein sequences were run through predotar twice once using the plant prediction networks and once using animal/fungal prediction networks that were not trained with _LOCATION_ sequences . a total of protein sequences were predicted to contain a _LOCATION_ targeting sequence by the plant networks and to contain a mitochondrial targeting sequence by the animal/fungal networks . this list contains proteins that were previously reported to be dual targeted in arabidopsis which represents a significant enrichment compared to the number of known dual targeted proteins expected to occur in a random group of this size of organelle targeted proteins suggesting that this approach is useful in narrowing down candidates . the dual targeting candidates were then ranked by their mitochondrial score using the animal/fungal networks minus the mitochondrial score using the plant networks . this ranking places most of the known dual targeted proteins towards the top of the list . as a second strategy we used available proteome datasets to predict dual targeting . the reported proteomes of mitochondria and chloroplasts have an overlap of proteins _PROTEIN_ database citation and references therein three of which have been previously reported to be dual targeted again significantly more than expected in any random group of proteins . in a third computational approach all known and putative peroxisomal proteins in the araperox database were cross referenced against proteins that had been experimentally identified in mitochondria or chloroplasts or that were predicted to be mitochondrial or _LOCATION_ using prediction _METHOD_ . this produced a list of nine proteins . as there are no known proteins targeted to mitochondria and _LOCATION_ it was not possible in advance to determine the significance of these predictions . to further identify potentially dual targeted proteins we focused on processes that occur in different organelles specifically dna replication and transcription . several known dual targeted proteins such as two dna polymerases a reca homologue and an rna polymerase which are targeted to both mitochondria and chloroplasts fit into this functional group . from computational screens of the arabidopsis genome using publicly available information resources and databases we identified seven additional uncharacterized genes encoding proteins potentially involved in dna replication _PROTEIN_ or structural organization that were predicted to be mitochondrial or _LOCATION_ according to the predotar and targetp _METHOD_ . this group of proteins was selected for experimental studies . eleven transcription _PROTEIN_ that have been predicted but as yet not experimentally confirmed to be located in mitochondria as well as in the _LOCATION_ were also tested . a number of approaches were used to predict dual targeted proteins in arabidopsis . the total number of proteins predicted by each approach to be dual targeted and the number of experimentally verified dual targeted proteins is indicated for each approach . the enrichment of dual targeting proteins in each list was determined compared to groups of randomly selected mitochondrial and chloroplasts proteins as outlined in experimental procedures . the targeting ability of the number of proteins tested from each group and the number of dual targeted proteins from each group after this study are also shown . the totals represent the non redundant numbers tested due to overlap between groups . athis group includes three alternative nad h dehydrogenases that we have shown to be dual targeted to mitochondria and _LOCATION_ . taken together all computational approaches produced a non redundant list of proteins of which have previously been reported to be dual targeted . in order to experimentally test the predicted dual targeting we generated _METHOD_ reporter constructs for of these proteins . the predator list of was too long to test systematically so we chose five proteins from the top and more throughout the list allowing assessment of the rank order . for the _METHOD_ spec list of proteins that have been determined to be located in mitochondria and _LOCATION_ we tested of these proteins and for the other lists we tested more than of the proteins . in the case of the predator and _METHOD_ spec lists the proteins were chosen at random within the parameters outlined above . mitochondrial and _LOCATION_ targeting were tested using c terminal tagging with _METHOD_ and peroxisomal targeting was studied using n terminal tagging . _METHOD_ was fused to the full or partial sequence of candidate proteins and _METHOD_ was monitored following biolistic transformation of arabidopsis cell cultures with these constructs . this approach allowed a relatively large number of samples to be tested as each test only requires ml of culture cells on a filter support on an _METHOD_ agar plate . when investigating dual targeting to mitochondria and _LOCATION_ arabidopsis seedlings and onion epidermal cells were transformed in addition to cell cultures . to define the subcellular localization of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ with certainty we generated _METHOD_ control constructs driving _PROTEIN_ of mitochondrial _LOCATION_ or peroxisomal targeted _METHOD_ . for each protein to be tested _METHOD_ constructs were co transformed with the appropriate _METHOD_ control constructs . this avoided using stains such as mitotracker to define organelles and provided a positive control for the success of transformation and protein uptake into the appropriate organelle . the subcellular localizations of all proteins tested are shown in figures and and figures and . to experimentally define proteins that were targeted to mitochondria and _LOCATION_ n and c terminal _METHOD_ fusions were constructed and targeting was studied for three proteins . when _METHOD_ was placed at the c terminus of a carrier protein malonyl coa decarboxylase or alanine/glyoxylate aminotransferase a _METHOD_ pattern that was identical to that obtained with mitochondrial _METHOD_ was observed . however when _METHOD_ was placed at the n terminus a pattern that overlapped with peroxisomal _METHOD_ was obtained . to confirm that the peroxisomal targeting was due to the predicted peroxisomal targeting signal type _PROTEIN_ at the c terminus of the proteins the last amino acids of each of the three proteins were fused to the c terminus of _METHOD_ . peroxisomal _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was again observed . thus dual targeting was detected for the three proteins tested from the group of putative peroxisomal and mitochondrial proteins but this depended on the nature of the _METHOD_ construct . when testing the targeting properties of the seven proteins that may function in dna _PROTEIN_ replication or transcription we detected dual targeting to mitochondria and chloroplasts for three proteins a topoisomerase i topi like protein a protein with similarity to the human mitochondrial dna helicase twinkle and a protein related to human and arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . for attopi as for the dual targeted dna polymerase which we used as a control the intensity of _METHOD_ from mitochondria and _LOCATION_ was equal in most transformed suspension cells . for attwinkle the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ was much stronger than mitochondrial _METHOD_ in suspension cells and onion cells but the intensity of _METHOD_ from mitochondria was equal to that from _LOCATION_ in arabidopsis seedlings . the different intensities of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the two organelles were not restricted to this group of proteins . when we tested the targeting of calcium sensing receptor _PROTEIN_ a phosphoprotein that has been shown to be located in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but is potentially dual targeted according to predotar and organelle proteome overlap dual targeting was observed with onion epidermal cells and with arabidopsis seedlings but not with suspension cell cultures . we previously observed a similar tissue specific variation of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ for dual targeted type ii nad h dehydrogenases . thus the ability to detect dual targeting depended on the nature of the tissue . the above findings prompted us to analyse the targeting ability of dna polymerase which has been previously reported as a dual targeted protein . citation detected targeting exclusively to _LOCATION_ if translation was initiated at the first in frame aug codon . when using a construct that included the annotated utr dual targeting was observed which was proposed to be due to translation starting at a cug codon seven amino acids upstream of the aug . the authors proposed that the targeting of is regulated by alternative translation initiation . in contrast we observed that when translation started at the first in frame aug _METHOD_ was targeted to both mitochondria and _LOCATION_ even though mitochondrial _METHOD_ was much weaker than _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ in suspension cells . mitochondrial _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected in onion cells and arabidopsis seedlings and exclusive mitochondrial localization was occasionally observed in arabidopsis seedlings . addition of seven amino acids was performed as described by citation resulting in targeting to both organelles with equal intensity of _METHOD_ in arabidopsis cell suspensions and onion cells but only to mitochondria in arabidopsis seedlings . to further study the import of into mitochondria and _LOCATION_ we performed in vitro import assays on the dna polymerase protein starting with the standard aug codon . although such large proteins are usually difficult to study with in vitro import assays we readily detected the import of this protein into mitochondria isolated from arabidopsis seedlings . import was abolished by addition of valinomycin to the import assay indicating that it was dependent on the _LOCATION_ potential as expected for a protein translocated into the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ . no import of the precursor of the small subunit of ribulose bisphosphate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ into isolated mitochondria was observed indicating that the import of observed was not due to _LOCATION_ contamination or non specific import of chloroplast proteins into isolated mitochondria as previously reported for isolated pea mitochondria but not for isolated arabidopsis mitochondria as used in this study . we next analysed the kinetics of import into mitochondria isolated from suspension cell cultures and arabidopsis seedlings used in the above import assays . after min when the import rate was still relatively linear the import of alternative oxidase _PROTEIN_ was almost twofold higher into mitochondria isolated from seedlings compared to cultured cells and a large difference persisted even after min . for import of a difference of at min was also observed between mitochondria isolated from seedlings compared to cultured cells . as equal amounts of mitochondrial protein were used in the above import assays we analysed the abundance of several components of the mitochondrial import apparatus a representative immunoblot from several mitochondrial preparations is shown . differences were observed for some components e.g . was approximately twice as abundant in mitochondria isolated from cell cultures compared to mitochondria isolated from plant material . the opposite was seen with . thus isolated mitochondria from different tissues import proteins at different rates which might be related to differences in the abundance of particular components of the mitochondrial import apparatus . a number of transcription _PROTEIN_ have been predicted to be targeted to mitochondria and _LOCATION_ in arabidopsis and rice . we tested the targeting of eight of these transcription _PROTEIN_ to mitochondria . for three of these we initially fused full length cdnas to the _METHOD_ coding sequence . with one exception this resulted in no _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . a mitochondrial pattern was obtained for the transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ indicating that the protein had mitochondrial targeting ability . as _METHOD_ fused to the n terminus of this protein had been shown previously to target to _LOCATION_ we concluded that this transcription _PROTEIN_ is dual targeted . for the seven other transcription _PROTEIN_ predicted to possess n terminal mitochondrial transit peptides we fused _METHOD_ to the first amino acids of these proteins . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was seen _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ and also in the _LOCATION_ but never in mitochondria for these constructs . for two of the proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we cloned full length cdnas in order to perform in vitro import assays into isolated arabidopsis mitochondria . no import was detected indicating that none of the seven transcription _PROTEIN_ is targeted to mitochondria .
a cloning cassette was constructed to allow recombination cloning of cdna clones using cloning techniques according to the manufacturer s instructions . this strategy was chosen for all but nine genes . for those nine genes reporter gene constructs were produced by replacing the _PROTEIN_ sequence in the targeting control vectors described below with the cdna sequence of the gene to be tested . the arabidopsis gene locus and the primers used for each constructs are listed in table . five _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ fusions were produced as controls for subcellular localization . the alternative oxidase _PROTEIN_ targeting signal of amino acids and the full length cdna of the small subunit of ribulose bisphosphate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were fused to _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ as mitochondrial and chloroplast controls respectively . the peroxisomal targeting control contained the _PROTEIN_ targeting signal of pumpkin malate synthase fused to the c terminus of _METHOD_ . biolistic transformations of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ constructs were performed on arabidopsis cell culture seedlings and onion epidermal cells as previously reported . the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ plasmids were co precipitated onto gold particles and transformed using the biolistic _PROTEIN_ system . particles were bombarded onto either ml of arabidopsis cell suspension resting on filter paper on osmoticum plates to day old arabidopsis seedlings placed on filter paper on standard _METHOD_ plates or onion cell epidermal peels placed on filter paper on standard _METHOD_ plates . after bombardment all arabidopsis cell suspension seedlings and onion cells were placed in the dark at for h before visualization of _METHOD_ . localization of transient _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was performed using an olympus _METHOD_ microscope with excitation wavelengths of nm _METHOD_ and nm _METHOD_ and emission wavelengths of nm _METHOD_ and nm _METHOD_ . subsequent images were captured using imaging software as previously described . dual targeted proteins were predicted in a number of different ways . the predator prediction program can be used in animal or plant mode . the entire predicted arabidopsis proteome was analysed twice to produce a mitochondrial targeting prediction in the animal mode and a _LOCATION_ targeting prediction in the plant mode . the proteins that passed both screens were ranked using the score for targeting to mitochondria using the animal mode minus the score for mitochondrial targeting in the plant mode . to predict proteins that are dual targeted between mitochondria and _LOCATION_ the list of predicted peroxisomal proteins from araperox was compared to known mitochondrial proteins using the _PROTEIN_ database . the subcellular localizations of the overlapping list of proteins were predicted using predictors of subcellular localization target p predotar mitoprotii ipsort subloc mitopred _METHOD_ multiloc loctree and peroxp . proteins were selected as candidates if either a mitochondrial location had already been published or a protein showed strong mitochondrial prediction by at least five predictors . _LOCATION_ loci encoding proteins potentially involved in mitochondrial dna _PROTEIN_ replication and transcription were identified from computational screens of the arabidopsis genome using publicly available databases at ncbi tair and ampdb . these screens were particularly directed at identifying homologues of established fungal and animal mitochondrial dna associated proteins mitochondrial homologues of proteins reported to associate with the _LOCATION_ genome and genes co _PROTEIN_ with arabidopsis type dna polymerases and predicted to be involved in dna related processes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the identified loci were screened for previously uncharacterized putative mitochondrial and _LOCATION_ gene products using _PROTEIN_ . additionally transcription _PROTEIN_ previously predicted to be targeted to mitochondria and the _LOCATION_ were tested for mitochondrial targeting ability . we suspected that the number of dual targeted proteins found in the list produced by the predotar method was greater than expected by chance . the very low proportion of known dual targeted proteins among proteins predicted to be either mitochondrial or _LOCATION_ prevents standard statistical techniques being used to demonstrate this so empirical p values were calculated by taking random sets of proteins from the set of proteins predicted to be mitochondrial or _LOCATION_ and identifying the number of known dual targeted proteins in each of these . the p values were taken as the number of random sets with at least dual targeted proteins divided by . three sets of proteins contained or more dual targeted proteins so there is an enrichment of dual targeted proteins in the set produced by the predotar method with a p value . similarly empirical p values were calculated to demonstrate the enrichment of dual targeted proteins in the _METHOD_ spec set . in this case random sets of proteins were selected from the proteins with experimental evidence for localization in the mitochondria or _LOCATION_ according to the _PROTEIN_ database . the p value was taken as the number of random sets with at least three dual targeted proteins divided by . in vitro import of proteins into isolated mitochondria and western blot analysis _LOCATION_ performed as previously described . to generate the _PROTEIN_ antibody a recombinant protein containing the first amino acids from the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ fused to an n terminal his affinity purification tag was _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli strain . the recombinant protein was purified by denaturing immobilized metal affinity chromatography _PROTEIN_ using the bio rad protein purification system . the resultant eluate was separated by v/v _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the recombinant protein was extracted using a bio rad model electro eluter . buffer exchange was performed using an amicon ultracel k centrifugal filter device such that the antigen was re suspended in _PROTEIN_ solution recovering a total of mg of protein for inoculation . four separate doses were administered to a rabbit at regular intervals over a month period using standard protocols and freud s complete adjuvant .
