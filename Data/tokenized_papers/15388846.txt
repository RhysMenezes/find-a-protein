transcription and mrna processing are regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the c terminal domain of rna polymerase ii which consists of tandem repeats of a heptapeptide . previous studies showed that members of the plant ctd phosphatase like protein family differentially regulate osmotic stress responsive and abscisic acid responsive transcription in arabidopsis thaliana . here we report that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ specifically dephosphorylate ser of the ctd heptad in arabidopsis rna polymerase ii but not ser . an n terminal catalytic domain of _PROTEIN_ which suffices for ctd ser phosphatase activity in vitro includes a signature dxdxt acylphosphatase motif but lacks a breast cancer ctd which is an essential component of the fungal and metazoan ctd phosphatase enzymes . the ctd of _PROTEIN_ which contains two putative double stranded rna binding motifs is essential for the in vivo function of _PROTEIN_ and includes a c terminal aa signal responsible for its _LOCATION_ targeting . _PROTEIN_ has a similar domain structure but contains only one double stranded rna binding motif . combining mutant alleles of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ causes synthetic lethality of the male but not the female gametes . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ exemplify a unique family of ctd ser specific phosphatases with an essential role in plant growth and development .
_PROTEIN_ like proteins are specific to plants . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are cpls initially identified in arabidopsis . they contain at their n termini an fcph domain characteristic of fungal and metazoan ctd phosphatases but they lack the brct domain located downstream of the fcph domains in the fungal microsporidian and metazoan enzymes . instead the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins contain putative double stranded rna binding motifs _METHOD_ downstream of their fcph domains . _PROTEIN_ has two _METHOD_ whereas _PROTEIN_ has one dsrbm . the other two arabidopsis cpls _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ resemble the fungal and metazoan phosphatases in that they have a brct domain near their c termini . deletion analyses have shown that the brct domain is essential for the phosphatase activity of yeast and metazoan proteins . the distinctive domain architecture of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ raises questions about their evolutionary origins and whether they are bona fide ctd phosphatases . with respect to the first question we were able to discern convincing homologs of _PROTEIN_ in the rice proteome _PROTEIN_ and among ests from plants including nicotiana benthamiana and medicago truncatura _PROTEIN_ . an alignment of the full length sequences of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with rice _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is shown in fig . which is published as supporting information on the pnas web site . all four plant polypeptides contain an n terminal fcph domain that includes the acylphosphatase signature motif dxdxt _PROTEIN_ . both of the aspartates of the dxdxt motif are essential for the activity of fungal microsporidian and metazoan ctd phosphatases . the overall identity between _PROTEIN_ and is whereas _PROTEIN_ and have identity . the fcph domain is especially well conserved _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in contrast fcph domains of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are only identical whereas _PROTEIN_ and human _PROTEIN_ are identical in the fcph domains . these comparisons indicate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are a distinct lineage of plant specific ctd phosphatase like proteins with unique domain architecture . arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ specifically dephosphorylated ser of ctd heptad motif . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ have ctd phosphatase activity we produced them in bacteria as tagged nusa fusions and isolated the recombinant fusion proteins from soluble bacterial lysates by ni affinity chromatography . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ analysis showed that the affinity purified material consisted of a heterogeneous array of polypeptides the largest of which were consistent with the sizes expected of nusa _PROTEIN_ and nusa _PROTEIN_ respectively the most abundant of which was similar in size to nusa . neither the putative full sized nusa cpl proteins nor the collection of to kda polypeptides migrating between them and nusa were present in the preparation of recombinant nusa that was purified in parallel . we surmise that the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins were susceptible to proteolysis in e. coli such that only a minor fraction of the nusa fusions recovered contained intact _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . nonetheless we assayed the preparations for ctd phosphatase activity using purified nusa and purified recombinant s. pombe ctd phosphatase as negative and positive controls respectively . to gauge whether the cpls have ctd phosphatase activity and whether they display any preference for the position of phosphoserine within the ctd heptad we used synthetic aa peptides consisting of four tandem heptad repeats phosphorylated exclusively at ser or ser of each heptad . reaction of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ preparations with the ser peptide resulted in pi release proportional to input protein whereas the nusa protein was inactive . addition of of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ preparations sufficed to hydrolyze and of the input ser residues respectively . the instructive finding was that the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ preparations did not catalyze pi release from the ser peptide . note that the ser peptide was an effective substrate for s. pombe . dephosphorylation of the ser ctd peptide by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ required a divalent cation . magnesium supported optimal activity at mm concentration . manganese and cobalt were also capable of satisfying the divalent cation requirement whereas calcium zinc and copper were ineffective . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ displayed a bell shaped ph profile with an optimum ph at . it is sensible that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as dxdxt acyl phosphatases would have optimal activity at mildly acidic ph because the phosphoryl transfer mechanism calls for an unprotonated aspartate nucleophile and a protonated aspartate general acid catalyst . these properties plus the strong selectivity of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ preparations for hydrolysis of ser versus ser suggest that the observed ctd phosphatase activity is attributable to the recombinant nusa _PROTEIN_ and nusa _PROTEIN_ proteins their impurity notwithstanding . this attribution is reinforced by ensuing studies of deleted versions of the _PROTEIN_ protein . the c terminal region of _PROTEIN_ is dispensable for ctd ser phosphatase activity . the primary structures of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ diverge in their c terminal regions except for the conserved _METHOD_ . the _PROTEIN_ mutant allele of _PROTEIN_ results in hyperactive stress induced transcription and mimics in most respect the effects of a nonsense mutation in the region of _PROTEIN_ encoding the fcph domain . the _PROTEIN_ phenotype is attributed to a point mutation at a splice junction between the eighth exon and the eighth intron . here we amplified by rt pcr a _PROTEIN_ cdna from mrna obtained from the _PROTEIN_ mutant using primers in the eighth and exons . the cdna included the eighth but not the ninth intron indicating a specific splicing defect . the eighth intron of _PROTEIN_ is nt and contains an in frame stop codon . the predicted _PROTEIN_ protein encoded by the _PROTEIN_ mrna consists of an n terminal aa fragment of the wt protein plus a c terminal tail containing eight extra amino acids encoded by the included intron . the truncated mutant protein lacks the c terminal aa segment of wt _PROTEIN_ that contains the two putative _METHOD_ . to determine whether this deleted region is important for the catalytic activity of _PROTEIN_ we _PROTEIN_ a series of truncated _PROTEIN_ variants as _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins in e. coli and isolated them from soluble extracts by glutathione agarose affinity chromatography . _PROTEIN_ analysis of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ preparations revealed polypeptide constituents of the size expected for each fusion protein . the preparations also contained a prominent polypeptide of kda which could correspond to the bacterial chaperone groel . it is evident that the _PROTEIN_ fusions of the truncated _PROTEIN_ proteins are purer than the preparations of nusa _PROTEIN_ and nusa _PROTEIN_ analyzed initially . the instructive findings were that of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins catalyzed near quantitative hydrolysis of the input ser substrate but were virtually inert with the ser substrate . we estimated a minimal turnover number of s for the ser phosphatase activity of the truncated _PROTEIN_ proteins which was comparable to the observed turnover number for hydrolysis of a ser tetraheptad ctd substrate by s. pombe . although we can not compare the activity of these truncated versions with that of full length _PROTEIN_ this experiment demonstrates that deletion of as many as aa from the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ did not ablate its activity or alter its stringent specificity for dephosphorylation of ser . we infer that the effects of the c terminal truncation of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant are likely attributable to defects other than simple loss of catalytic activity . a further incremental c terminal truncation _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ resulted in a partial loss of ctd phosphatase activity whereas the n terminal deletion mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was catalytically inactive . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ dephosphorylate ser of the intact arabidopsis rna pol ii ctd . we tested the ability of _PROTEIN_ to dephosphorylate the full length ctd of arabidopsis pol ii which consists of heptads . phosphorylation of recombinant _PROTEIN_ atctd by the _LOCATION_ kinase caused a shift in the electrophoretic mobility of the atctd analogous to that seen with metazoan and fungal pol iio and _PROTEIN_ ctdo from human . accordingly we designated this phosphorylated low mobility form as _PROTEIN_ atctdo and the nonphosphorylated form as _PROTEIN_ atctda . _PROTEIN_ was recognized by mabs specific to ser and ser consistent with previous studies . upon treatment with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ atctdo was no longer recognized by but it retained its immunoreactivity with . the selective elimination of reactivity by _PROTEIN_ was magnesium dependent and was evident when the reactions were performed at its optimum acidic ph and neutral ph . similar results were obtained for recombinant _PROTEIN_ . the specificity of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for dephosphorylation of ser was underscored by the finding that treatment with the generic phosphatase calf intestine alkaline phosphatase abolished the reactivity of _PROTEIN_ atctdo to both and antibodies and reverted the electrophoretic mobility of _PROTEIN_ atctdo to that of unphosphorylated _PROTEIN_ atctda . _PROTEIN_ localizes to the arabidopsis _LOCATION_ . the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was analyzed by transiently _PROTEIN_ tandem affinity purification _METHOD_ cpl fusion proteins in arabidopsis protoplasts . the dsred protein fused to the simian virus large t antigen _LOCATION_ localization signal was used as a positive control for _LOCATION_ targeting . in protoplasts _PROTEIN_ tap _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ was detected exclusively in _LOCATION_ and colocalized with red _METHOD_ from dsred . the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ is consistent with genetic evidence that _PROTEIN_ regulates the transcription of stress responsive genes . in protoplasts _PROTEIN_ tap _METHOD_ or tap _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ a diffuse pattern of green _METHOD_ was observed in _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ indicating that neither protein had been targeted to a specific subcellular compartment . to further dissect the signals for _LOCATION_ targeting of _PROTEIN_ three polypeptide segments were fused individually to the c terminus of _METHOD_ to generate chimeric proteins _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . only _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was specifically targeted to _LOCATION_ . localization of a discrete nls within the _PROTEIN_ was achieved by fusing a series of _PROTEIN_ peptide fragments to _METHOD_ . the results show that the dsrbm motifs play no apparent role in _LOCATION_ targeting a aa c terminal peptide _PROTEIN_ sufficed for _LOCATION_ localization of _METHOD_ and deletion of amino acids abolished the nls activity . the c terminal nls region of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ is conserved in the rice _PROTEIN_ homolog . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have an essential redundant function in plant development . t dna insertion or splice junction mutations in the _PROTEIN_ gene altered aba sensitivity and freezing sensitivity in arabidopsis seedlings but did not cause lethality or a severe growth defect . this finding is in contrast to the lethality of loss of function mutations in fungi . to test functional redundancy between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we gauged the effect of combining the _PROTEIN_ mutation with the _PROTEIN_ allele which contains a t dna insertion in the ninth exon of _PROTEIN_ that disrupts its _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ mutation by itself causes early flowering in homozygous mutant plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and reduced fertility . nonetheless homozygous _PROTEIN_ plants were able to complete their life cycle and produce viable seeds . when we analyzed the genotype of progeny of a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plant no homozygous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants were identified in seedlings . the segregation ratio of each locus indicated the synthetic lethality of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gamete rather than zygotes . to determine the specific gametophytic lethality the genotypes of progeny from the reciprocal cross between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were analyzed . individual plants were first scored for _PROTEIN_ phenotype by using luciferase imaging analysis to assay overexpression of an integrated luciferase reporter driven by the _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ . the plants were then tested for the _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion by pcr . when the _PROTEIN_ plant was used as a pollen donor of _PROTEIN_ plants contained _PROTEIN_ t dna indicating that the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations can be cotransmitted through the megagametephyte . in contrast no _PROTEIN_ t dna was detected in _PROTEIN_ plants when the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plant was used as the pollen donor . these results established that the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations can not cotransmit through the pollen and thus at least one functional _PROTEIN_ family gene is required for normal plant development .
