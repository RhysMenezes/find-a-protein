rapid activation of phospholipase a by auxin or plant pathogen interaction suggests a function in signal transduction for this enzyme but the molecular identification of a _LOCATION_ pla carrying out this function remains open . we isolated four cdna sequences from arabidopsis atpla i atpla iia atpla iva andatpla ivc which are members of the patatin related pla gene family in plants and which are homologous to the animal independent gene family . _PROTEIN_ was measured by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction andatpla i transcripts were found preferentially in shoots atpla iia and atpla iva in roots andatpla ivc in flowers . transient _PROTEIN_ of the four pla green _METHOD_ protein fusion proteins in tobacco leaves showed they were located in the _LOCATION_ and not in the _LOCATION_ . surprisingly atpla green _METHOD_ protein was also localized to chloroplasts . the enzymatic activity of the purified recombinant atpla iva toward phosphatidylcholine was dependent on saturated at mm and had a ph optimum of about . it had both and specificity . the enzyme showed in vitro highest sensitivity toward the inhibitors palmitoyltrifluoromethyl ketone _PROTEIN_ arachidonyltrifluoromethyl ketone and tetrahydro pyran one and was also sensitive to other previously used inhibitors eicosatetraynoic acid and nordihydroguajaretic acid . the influence of these inhibitors on elongation in etiolated arabidopsis seedlings was tested and tetrahydro pyran one and eicosatetraynoic acid inhibited hypocotyl elongation maximally at concentrations close to theirk i in vitro .
by sequence comparisons we could not identify any sequence in the arabidopsis genome but we identified genes for patatin like pla protein sequences all having the conserved specific sequence motifs . both the genomic structures and the amino acid comparisons of these sequences suggested that they fall into three groups group comprising onlyatpla i group comprising atpla iia atpla iva atpla ivb atplavic andatpla v and group comprising atpla iib atpla iiia atpla iiib and atpla _PROTEIN_ . genes or putative genes are named with roman numerals according to the respective chromosomes and letters if multiple genes were located on a single chromosome . when atpla i was compared with the animal proteins scores of to identity were obtained which is reflected in the unrooted phylogenetic tree so that atpla i and group is considered to be evolutionary older than the other two plant gene groups . we assume that group is evolutionary younger than group because the catalytic domains of group is different from those of all other known iplas and because group is closest to the presumably old prokaryotic anabaena spp . sequence . the _PROTEIN_ that group sequences have only one intron may be explained by intron loss as has been observed in other arabidopsis gene families and may be associated with the evolution of small genomes . the amino acid sequences derived from cdnas of atpla i atpla iia atpla iva and atpla ivc are shown in figure . we also isolated cdnas for atpla iib atpla iiia atpla iiib atpla ivb andatpla _PROTEIN_ but failed to isolate atpla v. the full length cdna clone of atpla i could only be obtained by reverse transcriptase pcr . atpla i is not only unique by possessing an domain with the highest similarity to animal sequences but also by having two additional domains a leu rich repeat at the n terminus and a c terminal domain that is not similar to other known sequences . for atpla i we isolated two splice variants . the shorter one did not contain the fifth exon and contained a stop codon before the pla domain whereas the second longer cdna included an uninterrupted reading frame comprising all three domains and an additional exon that extended the lrr domain . the other shorter cdnas were isolated by screening several libraries or rt pcr _PROTEIN_ . we could find only a few ests for the arabidopsis pla sequences so we expected low _PROTEIN_ and chose competitive rt pcr to study their _PROTEIN_ in different tissues . the atpla i gene was _PROTEIN_ preferentially in shoots and also in flowers and roots but very little in leaves . genesatpla iia and atpla iva were _PROTEIN_ in the roots and were much weaker in the flowers shoots and leaves . the _PROTEIN_ of atpla ivc was preferentially observed in flowers but also in roots and was very low in leaves and shoots . everywhere but in leaves a somewhat longer splice variant was detected for the atpla ivc but this mrna was not further investigated . the quite different tissue specific _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ investigated here was reflected in their equally different promoter sequences and was verified by initial experiments with promoter gus transformants . because the other members of the gene family except atplav could be isolated by rt pcr this proves that these additional genesatpla iib atpla iiia atpla iiib andatpla _PROTEIN_ were also _PROTEIN_ and probably function in arabidopsis . sequence atpla iiib was isolated by citation and it is _PROTEIN_ most highly in roots less in flowers and _METHOD_ and least in leaves . a mutant resulting from activation tagging of gene atpla iiib exhibited the sturdy phenotype . taken together these data suggest both tissue preference and functional redundancy for the members of this gene family as has been found for other plant gene families . hydropathy plots for various plant patatin related sequences and the atplas showed that a signal peptide for secretion was present in all the patatins from potato several from tobacco and one protein sequence from cucumis but not in any of the arabidopsis sequences . to demonstrate the suspected _LOCATION_ compartmentation hybrid pla _METHOD_ from arabidopsis proteins were _PROTEIN_ transiently in tobacco leaves . all four _PROTEIN_ sequences atpla i atpla iia atpla iva andatpla ivc clearly were not located to the _LOCATION_ . for atpla iia atpla iva and atpla ivc a cytoplasmic localization is suggested but association with _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ can not be excluded . as demonstrated by a series of optical sections from palisade parenchyma cells and additional data the hybrid protein atpla i _METHOD_ colocalized with chloroplasts although not with all of them in a given cell . in previous studies known inhibitors were used to inhibit auxin dependent growth or auxin stimulation of a activity . to be able to compare the effect of inhibitors on an isolated enzyme and on biological responses it would be desirable to know the enzymological properties of the plas and especially the reaction of isolated pla to known . as a first step toward this goal the gene atpla iva was _PROTEIN_ as a n terminally his tagged protein inescherichia coli and purified . enzymatic activity was measured using a _METHOD_ phosphatidylcholine labeled at both fatty acids by a fluorochrome that was used in previous experiments in vivo . hydrolysis by the purified recombinant enzyme yielded _METHOD_ free fatty acid and _METHOD_ lysophosphatidylcholine as products . when a different phosphatidylcholine was used carrying a _METHOD_ fatty acid only at the _PROTEIN_ atom _METHOD_ lysophosphatidylcholine and _METHOD_ free fatty acid originated indicating that the enzyme had both and activity . hydrolysis was linear for min . although the sequence ofatpla iva to the class suggests that its activity would be independent of activity assays showed that it was dependent on being saturated at mm . the ph optimum of the enzyme was about . the enzyme showed highest sensitivity toward the inhibitors palmitoyltrifluoromethyl ketone _PROTEIN_ and tetrahydro pyran one _PROTEIN_ and it was also sensitive to other previously used inhibitors such as arachidonyltrifluoromethylcarbon eicosatetraynoic acid and nordihydroguajaretic acid . it was previously suggested that a pla is involved in auxin signal transduction because it became rapidly activated by auxin and inhibitors specifically prevented auxin action . therefore we tested the influence of inhibitors on auxin dependent elongation in etiolated arabidopsis seedlings . of all inhibitors tested _PROTEIN_ and etya strongly inhibited hypocotyl elongation at concentrations close to the k i in vitro . ndga was only marginally active and the other inhibitors were ineffective in vivo . this may have been perhaps because of their metabolism in plants or because of other unknown side effects .
the different members of the patatin related plas in arabidopsis were designated by their chromosome number and if necessary by additional letters . for isolation of the full length cdnas of the pla genes iia iva and ivc we used the gene specific primers atpla iia sense _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and antisense _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ atpla iva sense _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and antisense _PROTEIN_ andatpla ivc sense _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and antisense _PROTEIN_ . the primers were designed for the and untranslated region of the respective genes and were used for cycles pcr to amplify the specific cdna fragment from an arabidopsis lambda cdna library . by stepwise dilution of positive library fractions as described by citation the full length cdna phage clones from atpla iia iva and ivc were isolated according to the manufacturer 's protocol . plasmids were prepared and the cdna insertions were sequenced . the full length cdna fromatpla i with a length of kb could not be identified in the lambda cdna library uni zap xr . total rna was prepared from d old arabidopsis plants by the rna purification kit from qiagen . three _METHOD_ of rna was used for first strand cdna synthesis using oligo . one hundred _METHOD_ of cdna was taken for rt pcr using the primers sense _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and antisense to amplify the full length cdna

_PROTEIN_ . total rnas were prepared from roots shoots leaves and flowers and treated with dnase according to the manufacturer 's protocol . the rnas were subsequently examined with respect to contaminating dna using pcr . for this purpose the rna preparations were used for amplification reactions with each gene specific pla primer pair for cycles and analyzed by gel electrophoresis . initiated by an oligo primer first strand cdna was synthesized from each of total rna to quantify pla mrnas . the cdnas were amplified with gene specific primer pairs each derived from different exons

amplification was in the logarithmic range when ng cdna were used . a total of ng of purified first strand cdnas was used for subsequent amplification reactions . conditions for amplification were for s for s and for s. the rt pcr products were bp bp and bp in length and their identities were verified by sequencing . competitor dna as an internal standard was obtained by the addition of fg fg and fg of the appropriate cloned genomic dna fragment harboring an intron which led to the respective larger amplification products . the pcr products were analyzed by electrophoretic separation on agarose gels and quantified by using the program scan pack . the relative amounts of cdnas were calculated by the formula / setting the highest value to . because the gene specific primer pair for atpla ivc resulted in amplification of two splicing variants a competitive rt pcr described above was not possible . to normalize rt pcr amplification control reactions were run with the primers sense

amounts of first strand cdna were ng for atpla ivc transcript amplification and ng for actin transcript amplification . pcr was performed through cycles of for s for s and for s for actin gene fragments . the open reading frame of _METHOD_ from _METHOD_ was amplified in a pcr reaction for cycles using the sense primer _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the antisense primer _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to introduce a xbai and sali recognition site at the n terminus of the open reading frame of the _METHOD_ . the amplified pcr product was digested with saci andxbai and was ligated into the vector . the open reading frames of the pla cdnas of genes atpla i iia iva and ivc were amplified by pcr using the sense primers for ia _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ for iia

_METHOD_ were done as described in the protocol plasmid mini preparation but without using the purification step by columns and then dissolved in sterile deionized water . one microgram of plasmid was bound to wolfram particles _PROTEIN_ in the presence of . pla _METHOD_ wolfram particles were shot by using a particle gun _PROTEIN_ into leaves fromnicotiana benthamiana being to cm in diameter . the transformed leaves were incubated in petri dishes for h in the dark to _PROTEIN_ the pla _METHOD_ fusion proteins and were analyzed by confocal laser microscopy _METHOD_ . for each construct three
