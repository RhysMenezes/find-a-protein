the plant _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ is the interface between the cell and its environment undertaking a range of important functions related to transport signaling cell wall biosynthesis and secretion . multiple proteomic studies have attempted to capture the diversity of proteins in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ using biochemical fractionation techniques . in this study two phase partitioning was combined with free flow electrophoresis to produce a population of highly purified _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ vesicles that were subsequently characterized by tandem _METHOD_ spectroscopy . this combined high quality _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ isolation technique produced a reproducible proteomic library of over proteins with an extended dynamic range including _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ associated proteins . the approach enabled the detection of a number of putative _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins not previously identified by other studies including peripheral _LOCATION_ proteins . utilizing multiple data sources we developed a pm confidence score to provide a value indicating association to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . this study highlights over proteins that while seemingly abundant at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ are mostly unstudied . to validate this data set we selected candidates and transiently localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ using a _METHOD_ tag . given the importance of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ this data set provides a valuable tool to further investigate important proteins . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ data are available via proteomexchange identifier .
purification of pm by has been extensively employed in plants to provide enriched pm fractions for downstream analyses.citation however the success of the technique can be highly variable and result in contaminated _LOCATION_ fractions . the utilization of ffe as an extra purification strategy for organelles and vesicles has been well established.citation consequently we sought to exploit the capacity of ffe to isolate high purity pm fractions from photosynthetic plant material . liquid culture grown arabidopsis seedlings were harvested and _METHOD_ were enriched by . these fractions were then subjected to further purification by ffe . the majority of pm vesicles seem to migrate as an to fraction peak between fractions and when using the ffe conditions outlined in this study . this is appreciably further toward the cathode than other potentially contaminating organelles citation meaning ffe can further purify pm vesicles isolated by . to confirm that this fraction peak corresponded to pm vesicles antibodies raised against the pm marker h _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were used to profile post ffe fractions . the ability of the ffe to separate contaminating _LOCATION_ from the pm after was assessed using antibodies raised against _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ mitochondria _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ marker proteins . pm vesicles were clearly enriched by and qualitatively ffe produced minimal further enrichment as assessed by _PROTEIN_ . other organelle markers were reduced in the ffe fractions . mitochondrial and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were barely detectable in the pm peak after ffe . _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were detected beyond the anodic edge of the _PROTEIN_ pm peak indicating efficient removal of _LOCATION_ contaminants during electrophoresis . in contrast _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ proteins that persisted through were not substantially removed from pm vesicles during ffe . pm vesicles from ffe fractions of two independent biological replicates comprising the apex of the pm peak as defined by the aha marker were collected and harvested by ultracentrifugation . a total of two adjacent fractions from the first replicate and pools of three fractions from the second replicate were digested overnight with trypsin and analyzed by lc _METHOD_ . resultant spectral data from lc _METHOD_ analyses of fractions were exported and analyzed using the mascot search engine against arabidopsis proteins . a strict approach to data matching was employed where only peptides with ions scores above the p < cutoff were accepted and a bold red peptide match was required for each protein match . given these criteria only a single peptide was necessary for a protein match in each replicate . for the experiment atpm a total of proteins were identified in fraction and proteins in fraction while for experiment atpm a total of proteins were identified in pooled fractions and proteins in pooled fractions . details of matched peptide data for the four samples analyzed by lc _METHOD_ are outlined in table s . data were manually curated to remove redundant protein matches . this resulted in the identification of and nonredundant protein matches in each of the two analyses . the number of proteins identified in both experiments was which represents the protein set enriched by ffe referred to as the ffe pm proteome . this combined set of was manually curated to ensure consistency between redundant protein matches between the four replicates . the redundant protein matches encompass proteins matched with identical peptides outlined in table s . these proteins represent valid protein matches many of them encoded by alternatively spliced transcripts . to assist in the classification of proteins identified in the ffe pm proteome a pm confidence score was developed based on gene ontologies subcellular localizations gene _PROTEIN_ and manual curation . gene _PROTEIN_ normalization was performed by dividing the protein abundance by its normalized transcript level derived from data from day old wild type arabidopsis seedlings.citation while individual transcript and protein levels may only be weakly correlated high transcript levels are expected to roughly correlate with higher protein presence and detection . protein abundance was ranked from most to least abundant before and after normalization to the transcript level of the corresponding gene . subtraction of the after normalization rank from the before normalization rank on the protein abundance list yielded a value . high values revealed proteins disproportionately enriched in the ffe pm proteome compared to transcript abundance . after gene _PROTEIN_ normalization proteins whose values were most increased tended to be low abundance proteins . the top proteins had an average of six spectral counts . these likely represent proteins that were enriched by the purification methods that is proteins that are localized to the pm . in contrast the highly abundant and highly _PROTEIN_ family of h _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which had an average of total spcs was largely unaffected by gene _PROTEIN_ normalization . proteins targeted to the secretory pathway either by transmembrane domains or n terminal signal sequences are expected to be well represented in the ffe pm proteome . indeed after gene _PROTEIN_ normalization of proteins in the top list contained a transmembrane domain while only a single contaminating ribosomal protein was found in the top list . conversely ribosomal proteins comprised of the bottom indicating that relative to their high _PROTEIN_ level they were depleted by the combination of and ffe . since pm proteins only represent a subset of proteins encoded by a seedling transcriptome changes in ranked abundance after normalization suggest an incongruity between transcript and protein abundance after pm purification . the approach both highlights pm proteins and de emphasizes contaminants . in addition to after gene _PROTEIN_ normalization _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis database _PROTEIN_ consensus localization scorescitation and the gene ontology cellular component annotation from taircitation were also included in calculation of the pm confidence score . _PROTEIN_ and go categories were assigned a value between and . a minimum pm confidence score of was assigned to annotations unrelated to pm while a maximum score of was assigned to annotated pm associated proteins . values from to were also used to generate pm confidence scores for gene _PROTEIN_ . these three pm confidence scores from the different methods were averaged to generate a confidence score for each protein . the ffe pm proteome contains annotated ribosomal proteins citation with an average confidence score of while the identified receptor like kinasescitation had an average pm confidence score of . thus receptor like kinases which are likely pm localized had a high average pm confidence score while ribosomal proteins which are likely pm proteome contaminants had low average pm confidence scores . therefore the pm confidence score effectively separated potential contaminants from genuine pm proteins . proteins in the post ffe pm proteome were assigned to functional and subcellular categories using data from mapmancitation and _PROTEIN_ in combination with the calculated pm confidence scores . after manual curation a total of proteins could be confidently assigned as pm proteins . proteins derived from contaminating organelles constituted of the proteins identified . a collection of proteins were assigned as having functional associations to the pm and included proteins assigned as vesicle trafficking cell organization chaperones proteins and _LOCATION_ proteins . collectively these proteins comprised of the ffe pm proteome . lastly a total of proteins were unable to be assigned a clear function or subcellular location but many contained high pm confidence scores . this group was assigned unclear indicating an unclear function or subcellular location within the cell . given the pm enriched nature of the preparation many likely represent authentic pm associated proteins . the contribution of contaminants to a proteome is more accurately assessed when some measure of relative abundance is taken into account . organelle distribution in the ffe pm proteome was thus also estimated using average spectral counts . although this approach only resulted in a marginal increase in the proportion of proteins assigned to the pm it significantly reduced the contribution of contaminants to less than a fifth of the proteome . this difference _METHOD_ that proteins from contaminating organelles tend to be reduced in abundance in the post ffe pm fractions . pm associated proteins were enriched from when analyzed by relative abundance in the samples . proteins contributing to this increase categorized to the cell organization category including actin tubulin and annexins . the contribution of proteins allocated as unclear was reduced to suggesting these either originate from contaminating _LOCATION_ or are low abundance pm proteins . a total of separate studies have sought to purify and characterize the pm proteome from arabidopsis citation however this study represents the first pm proteome utilizing ffe as an orthogonal purification strategy.citation of the proteins a total of were allocated as an unclear location or category . interestingly of these proteins had not previously been identified in any subcellular proteome and many had been assigned a high pm confidence score . while only contributing about of the total proteins identified this is a noteworthy observation considering that over targeted proteomes have been characterized in arabidopsis which cumulatively has identified nearly proteins.citation consequently we selected a number of candidates from the proteome for localization using _METHOD_ proteins _METHOD_ . these candidates were relatively abundant in our preparations based on spc had a range of pm confidence scores and had either not been previously localized to the pm or had contradictory subcellular assignments from other studies . the gene products were cloned into the pbullet pm vectorscitation to enable either c or n terminal yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ colocalization and fusion proteins were localized using particle bombardment and confocal microscopy . a total of candidates were selected however only successfully _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ marker . those tagged with c terminal _METHOD_ all showed some colocalization with the pm marker protein _PROTEIN_ . localization to the pm was assessed by light microscopy using m mannitol citation which resulted in shrinkage of the protoplast and detachment of the pm from the cell wall . in addition hechtian strands representing areas of adhesion between the pm _LOCATION_ and the cell wall were consistently visible with of the constructs . for proteins tagged with n terminal _METHOD_ four out of colocalized with the pm marker . the other nine n terminal fusions did not show any signal which could be attributed to the presence of a predicted n terminal signal sequence or lipid modification . an examination of the structure of these localized proteins reveals that candidates include predicted _LOCATION_ proteins with single transmembrane domains such as uncharacterized receptor like kinases transporters and multipass proteins of unknown function . finally although some of these pm candidates contained no predicted transmembrane domain they colocalized successfully with the pm marker . overall the transient localization demonstrates that the combination of coupled to ffe identified many unknown bone fide pm localized proteins .

spc for the pm proteome . proteins were annotated using the go plant slim annotations from taircitation and _PROTEIN_ consensus subcellular localization.citation the data were also manually compared

by dividing protein spc by its exp . the change in ranked abundance of each protein after normalization was calculated by subtracting the rank of the protein after normalization from the rank before
