the biogenesis and activity of chloroplasts in both vascular plants and algae depends on an intracellular network of _LOCATION_ encoded trans acting _PROTEIN_ that control almost all aspects of organellar gene _PROTEIN_ . most of these regulatory _PROTEIN_ belong to the helical repeat protein superfamily which includes tetratricopeptide repeat pentatricopeptide repeat and the recently identified octotricopeptide repeat proteins . whereas green algae _PROTEIN_ many different opr proteins only a single orthologous opr protein is encoded in the genomes of most land plants . here we report the characterization of the only opr protein in arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ which has previously been implicated in plant pathogen defense . loss of _PROTEIN_ led to a severe defect in processing of chloroplast rrna resulting in impaired chloroplast translation and photosynthesis . in vitro rna binding and rnase protection assays revealed that _PROTEIN_ has an intrinsic and specific rna binding capacity and the _PROTEIN_ binding site was mapped to the region of the rrna precursor . nucleoid localization of _PROTEIN_ was shown by transient green _METHOD_ protein import assays implicating the nucleoid as the site of chloroplast rrna processing . taken together our data indicate that the single opr protein in arabidopsis is important for a basic process of chloroplast biogenesis .
a few putative opr proteins have been reported in arabidopsis . however reevaluation of available genomic data has revealed only a single opr protein _PROTEIN_ . arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ exhibits a putative _LOCATION_ transit peptide of amino acids . the mature protein has a molecular _METHOD_ of kd . its c terminal half comprises four opr repeats followed by a _PROTEIN_ domain which is probably related to opr repeats . secondary structure analysis with the jpred algorithm predicted the presence of two helices in each of the opr repeats identified as in the case of _PROTEIN_ and tpr repeats . this helical structure of the opr repeats is further supported by the prediction of the structure of the region representing opr repeats to . interestingly similarity searches revealed also only a single orthologous opr gene in representative land plant genomes investigated including the moss p. patens . the analysis of these opr proteins showed clear conservation at the c terminus including the opr repeats and the _PROTEIN_ domain indicating a monophyletic origin whereas the n terminal region is more variable . like _PROTEIN_ all analyzed orthologs are predicted to possess an organellar targeting signal . to characterize the function of _PROTEIN_ we analyzed the arabidopsis mutant line rap which carries a t dna insertion in the third exon of the _PROTEIN_ gene . homozygous mutants were obtained from the generation . the arabidopsis rap mutant _PROTEIN_ was reported by citation to lack the full length _PROTEIN_ mrna and to exhibit retarded growth and a photobleached phenotype . we confirmed this phenotype and we also uncovered a defect in photosynthetic activity in rap based on our measurements of the maximal efficiency of photosystem ii photochemistry . the phenotype of rap was complemented by introducing an _PROTEIN_ cdna . even though week old complemented plants displayed slightly variegated and more serrated leaves than the wild type their photosynthetic performance _METHOD_ was restored . except for a slightly retarded growth week old plants displayed an almost completely wild type phenotype . because the introduced _PROTEIN_ sequence was _PROTEIN_ under control of the strong constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus promoter the variegated leaf phenotype in younger plants suggests a dose dependent function of _PROTEIN_ during early developmental stages . however even though unlikely we can not formally exclude a second mutation in rap that might be responsible for the incomplete restoration of the wild type phenotype in young complemented plants . because photosynthesis was clearly affected in rap we analyzed the levels of core proteins of photosynthetic complexes in the rap mutant line . whereas amounts of the _LOCATION_ encoded light harvesting complex ii proteins were found to be unaffected in rap amounts of all chloroplast encoded proteins tested including the psii reaction center protein the photosystem i reaction center protein _PROTEIN_ and the large subunit of rubisco _PROTEIN_ were clearly reduced . we next investigated the de novo synthesis rates of chloroplast encoded proteins by performing in vivo pulse labeling experiments . as shown in figure the overall protein synthesis rate was markedly lower in rap relative to the wild type . the analysis of chloroplast transcripts revealed reductions in the steady state levels of most of the analyzed mrnas like _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ although the _PROTEIN_ transcript was present in wild type amounts . most strikingly inspection of the ethidium bromide stained rrnas used as a loading control uncovered a dramatic reduction in _LOCATION_ rrna in mutant plants whereas the cytoplasmic rrna and _LOCATION_ rrnas accumulated normally . because rrna is required for ribosome assembly and therefore for translation in chloroplasts these data are consistent with the observed general _PROTEIN_ in chloroplast protein synthesis and explain the growth retarded chlorotic phenotype of rap mutants . chloroplast rrna is cotranscribed with and rrnas as well as two trnas yielding a single rna precursor that undergoes a complex series of processing events . to investigate these events in detail rna gel blot analyses were performed on total leaf rnas from week old wild type and rap plants using rrna specific probes . we detected equal amounts of the full length rrna precursor in rap and the wild type indicating that accumulation of the full length precursor rrna is not significantly altered in the mutant . however as suggested by the ethidium bromide stained gels much less of the mature rrna of knt is present in rap whereas probes specific for rrnas retaining unprocessed and ends revealed a dramatic accumulation of such precursors in rap . both and specific probes detected a rrna precursor of knt . in addition the probe detected a less abundant knt precursor that was not identified with the probe . this indicates that some albeit incomplete processing of the end of the immature knt species occurs leading to the accumulation of unprocessed but processed rrnas . thus failure to process the end does not preclude trimming of the end . in contrast with rrna maturation processing and accumulation of and rrnas were not affected in rap . moreover wild type levels of mature rrna were restored in rap mutants transformed with _PROTEIN_ cdna confirming that the lack of _PROTEIN_ is responsible for the defect in the maturation of rrna . to identify the ends of the related transcripts that accumulate in the rap mutant a primer extension analysis was performed . in agreement with the rna gel blot analysis the total amount of correctly processed mature rna was appreciably reduced in the rap mutant relative to the wild type . by contrast pre rrna ends originating from initiation at the promoter at position _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ as well as from processing at position were clearly more abundant in the rap mutant . in addition to these known rrna ends we observed some transcript ends downstream of that are more abundant in rap than in the wild type and are likely to represent unspecific processing and/or degradation products . taken together these data indicate that maturation of rrna is inefficient in the absence of _PROTEIN_ . a recent analysis of rna deep sequencing data sets identified small rnas in the chloroplast of arabidopsis which are hypothesized to represent footprints of rna binding proteins that protect them from degradation . three such putative footprints had been identified within the precursor . rna probes spanning these possible _PROTEIN_ footprints were hybridized to total rnas prepared from wild type or rap plants and analyzed in an rnase protection assay . with probes and protected fragments were obtained in both the wild type and rap indicating that these two srnas accumulate independently of _PROTEIN_ . however probe spanning an nucleotide footprint downstream of the promoter _METHOD_ detected two srnas of to nucleotides in length that are protected by total rna from the wild type but not from rap plants . weaker signals in this size range obtained for rap were also detected when yeast trna was used as a negative control and these were therefore not considered as protected fragments . hence these data strongly suggest that _PROTEIN_ mediates its function by binding nucleotides upstream of the end of the mature rrna . as _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ not to be involved in the protection of the other two putative footprints within the precursor rrna other rna binding proteins like _PROTEIN_ might play a complementary or independent role in the maturation process . to test for an intrinsic rna binding activity of the recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein which would support its direct involvement in srna protection in vitro rna binding assays were performed . as _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in fusion with a glutathione s transferase tag resulted in very low overall _PROTEIN_ levels the protein was fused to the maltose binding protein which had previously been used to successfully _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ proteins . using this system reasonably high _PROTEIN_ levels and sufficient amounts of soluble _PROTEIN_ protein were obtained . to exclude an interference of the mbp tag with the rna binding capacity of _PROTEIN_ we proteolytically removed the tag prior to rna binding assays . an in vitro transcribed rna probe spanning the putative binding site for _PROTEIN_ in the region was cross linked to rrap by irradiation with uv light . as positive control we used the rna binding protein _PROTEIN_ which had previously been shown to bind unspecifically to rna in vitro . purified mbp served as a negative control . a single signal in the expected size range for rrap was observed indicating that rrap directly interacts with rna and that the protein preparation contains no substantial contaminating rna binding activities from escherichia coli . since uv cross linking of rna and protein leads to their covalent linkage this assay is not suitable for detection of rna binding activities under noncompetitive conditions . we therefore employed filter binding assays that leave _PROTEIN_ in its native state to determine the equilibrium constant for the binding reactions of _PROTEIN_ to different rnas . besides the putative target rna we included its complementary sequence as well as sequences of the _PROTEIN_ untranslated region and the noncoding _PROTEIN_ region . all probes were similar in length and gc content and exhibited a similar or lower propensity to form secondary structures than the specific probe . prior to the binding reactions the integrity and concentration of rna probes was verified by gel electrophoresis . whereas the kd value obtained for the putative target rna was nm and therefore similar to those measured for other chloroplast rna protein interactions kd values for the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and antisense probes were considerably higher and could not be determined under these conditions . this supports the specific binding of _PROTEIN_ to the footprint rna identified in vivo and suggests that _PROTEIN_ itself carries the _PROTEIN_ determinants required for specific recognition of its binding site within the region of the precursor of rrna . however a slightly increased affinity of rrap was observed for the antisense probe compared with the other nontarget probes . in order to further substantiate the rna binding specificity of _PROTEIN_ competition experiments using a similar filter binding assay were performed . same amounts of rrap were incubated with the radiolabeled rna probe containing its putative binding site in the presence of either homologous or heterologous competitor rnas . the concentration and integrity of rna probes was again verified by gel electrophoresis . as shown in figure the competing effect was strongest when the homologous rna was used thereby confirming a specific binding of _PROTEIN_ to the probe . in agreement with data from the binding curves the competition experiments revealed an increased competition effect of the antisense probe compared with the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ probes . interestingly a comparison of sense and antisense sequences elucidated a sequence of eight identical nucleotides corresponding to the end of the identified footprint . hence the antisense probe includes approximately half of the putative _PROTEIN_ binding site and this most likely accounts for the somewhat higher affinity of _PROTEIN_ to this rna compared with the other nonspecific rnas . little is known about the spatial organization of the process of rrna maturation in chloroplasts . so far evidence derives from recent proteomic data from maize which suggest that the nucleoid the site of the chloroplast genome and a region of dna rna protein assembly is the major location of ribosome assembly and rrna processing in the chloroplast . we therefore attempted to determine whether _PROTEIN_ is targeted to chloroplasts and to determine its suborganellar localization . for this purpose green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ was fused to the c terminal end of _PROTEIN_ and transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco protoplasts under the control of a cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . as shown in figure the fusion protein accumulated in distinct spots overlapping the chlorophyll _METHOD_ of the chloroplasts . furthermore the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was colocalized with diamidino phenylindole stained nucleoid dna indicating its association with the nucleoids and thus supporting the idea that the nucleoid is the site of rrna maturation .
