ubiquitination of proteins is one of the critical regulatory _METHOD_ in eukaryotes . in higher plants protein ubiquitination plays an essential role in many biological processes including hormone signaling photomorphogenesis and pathogen defense . however the roles of protein ubiquitination in the reproductive process are not clear . in this study we identified four _PROTEIN_ genes designated aberrant pollen development _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ as regulators of pollen mitosis ii in arabidopsis thaliana . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant showed a significantly increased percentage of pollen at the mature pollen stage . further downregulation of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by rna interference resulted in more severe abnormal pollen phenotypes than in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ suggesting that cell division was defective in male gametogenesis . all of the four genes were _PROTEIN_ in multiple stages at different levels during male gametophyte development . confocal analysis using green florescence fusion proteins _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ showed that apds are associated with intracellular _LOCATION_ . furthermore _PROTEIN_ had ligase activity in vitro and five _PROTEIN_ proteins were identified . our results suggest that these four genes may be involved redundantly in regulating the pmii process during male gametogenesis .
the whole a. thaliana genome was predicted to encode _PROTEIN_ ligases . to identify the _PROTEIN_ genes that play critical roles in the a. thaliana reproductive process we examined the _PROTEIN_ profiles of all the _PROTEIN_ genes and selected those genes with a high and/or specific _PROTEIN_ pattern in pollen and sperm cells for further analysis . we found a cluster of four genes that were of particular interest _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . according to the microarray data _PROTEIN_ was ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ except for in sperm cells and pollen while _PROTEIN_ was specifically _PROTEIN_ in sperm cells and pollen . furthermore using the simple modular architecture research tool all four of these apds were predicted to contain two transmembrane domains and one _PROTEIN_ domain . the sequence alignment showed that _PROTEIN_ and were highly conserved especially in the _PROTEIN_ domain . _PROTEIN_ is greatly similar to _PROTEIN_ whereas the similarity among the others ranges from to . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were tandemly located on chromosome implying that they might be from recent duplication events . basic local alignment search tool search results showed that the apds were proteins suggesting that the apds might be involved in processes . to analyze the _PROTEIN_ patterns of the four apds we cloned their genomic dna including their promoter regions into a destination vector harboring a gene to generate papds constructs which were then introduced into wild type a. thaliana respectively . more than individual transgenic lines were obtained for each construct and the generation of the transgenic plants were used for gus staining analysis . in seedlings obvious gus activity was detected in the shoot apical meristem and root tip regions for all apds and the gus activity in _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines was weaker than that in the other three apd transgenic lines . the detection of high gus activity in the sam and root tip regions where cell division is most vigorous suggests a close link between the functions of these apd ligases and mitotic cell division . in inflorescence _PROTEIN_ was highly _PROTEIN_ in the pistil and in seeds but weakly _PROTEIN_ during male gametogenesis _PROTEIN_ was specifically observed in mature pollen . _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ only in young floral buds and seeds and _PROTEIN_ was detected in young floral buds carpels and seeds . the overlapping _PROTEIN_ pattern of the apds in inflorescence suggests that the four apds may play redundant roles in inflorescence . to analyze the subcellular localization of apds we cloned the coding sequences of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and fused them with the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ gene driven by a promoter . _METHOD_ was then introduced into wild type a. thaliana respectively . both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusion protein _METHOD_ signals were observed as intracellular _LOCATION_ sheets in the cytoplasm of the vegetative cells in pollen from transgenic lines but not in the _LOCATION_ of the sperm cells and the vegetative cells . in an in vitro assay the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signal was _PROTEIN_ observed in the tonoplast and endosomes in the germinating pollen tubes suggesting that apd proteins are associated with the intracellular _LOCATION_ and may participate in processes . to determine from which developmental stage apds were _PROTEIN_ during male gametophyte development the constructs papds _METHOD_ were generated for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and were introduced into wild type a. thaliana respectively . the _METHOD_ signals were observed at multiple stages during male gametogenesis . consistent with the result that very weak gus activity was detected in floral buds and pollen from _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines a very weak florescence signal was detected for _PROTEIN_ from the _PROTEIN_ bicellular pollen stage to the mature pollen stage . an _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signal was clearly detected from the early bicellular pollen stage to the mature pollen stage and the signal in vegetative cells increased with the development of pollen . no obvious _METHOD_ signal was detected for _PROTEIN_ in the microspore the early bicellular pollen stage or the middle bicellular pollen stage . instead the _METHOD_ florescence signal became stronger at the _PROTEIN_ bicellular pollen stage and gradually strengthened from the tricellular pollen stage to the mature pollen stage . these observations suggest that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may be involved in male gametogenesis . to analyze the possible function of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we requested from the arabidopsis biological research center _PROTEIN_ their insertion homozygous mutants _PROTEIN_ with a inserted in the third exon of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with a inserted in the sixth exon of _PROTEIN_ . reverse chain reaction analysis showed that no transcripts of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ were detected in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . we then crossed _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ to obtain the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . no obvious defects were observed in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ during the vegetative developmental stage . however when staining pollen with dihydrochloride we found that there were significantly more pollen grains in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant than in the wild type at the mature pollen stage . in the pollen at the dehiscence stage in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the vegetative cells developed normally while the other one cell was larger and brighter than the wild type sperm cell which probably resulted from more highly condensed chromatin and/or blocked cell division . the _PROTEIN_ that the percentage of pollen at the mature pollen stage was higher in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ than in either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ suggests that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may be functionally redundant in pmii during male gametogenesis . at the mature pollen stage although the percentage of pollen in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant was significantly higher than in the wild type the pollen population was not very large compared with that of the tricellular pollen in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the low percentage of pollen in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ may result from the functional redundancy between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ that were tandemly located with _PROTEIN_ in the chromosome . to test this hypothesis we generated an _PROTEIN_ construct driven by a _PROTEIN_ promoter which was specifically _PROTEIN_ in the generative cells and sperm cells and introduced it into _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants . as a result we found more pollen in different independent lines . in addition we observed more abnormal pollen in some lines in which two sperm _LOCATION_ displayed a dramatic difference in both size and brightness . statistical analysis on four independent transgenic lines showed that the percentages of pollen in these _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines were and respectively and higher than in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . analysis showed that the rna transcript level of apds correlated well with the percentage of pollen in the four _PROTEIN_ lines suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and play redundant but essential roles in the process of pmii during male gametogenesis . to test whether apds have ligase activity we _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli and purified tagged maltose binding protein _PROTEIN_ protein for an ligase activity assay . wheat human and with a his tag fused at its were also _PROTEIN_ in e. coli and purified for the assay . as shown in figure in the presence of and a polyubiquitination signal was observed by western blot using an antibody indicating that was able to catalyze . furthermore in the absence of or no polyubiquitination ladder was detected suggesting that the ligase activity of _PROTEIN_ was and . to identify the possible targets of _PROTEIN_ which are associated with intracellular _LOCATION_ we performed yeast screening with a dualmembrane system . out of clones we found five _PROTEIN_ proteins . two of these _PROTEIN_ proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which are parts of subunit c of the _PROTEIN_ that catalyzes _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis to transport protons were preferentially _PROTEIN_ in sperm cells and mature pollen . furthermore a rab subfamily homolog _PROTEIN_ which is involved in vesicle trafficking was also able to interact with _PROTEIN_ . the other two _PROTEIN_ proteins include an binding protein family protein _PROTEIN_ that was specifically _PROTEIN_ in pollen and a pollen ole e allergen and extensin family member _PROTEIN_ both of which are functionally uncharacterized . identification of these possible will help clarify our understanding of the biological roles of apds in pmii during male gametogenesis .
