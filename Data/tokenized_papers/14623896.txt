_PROTEIN_ has been implicated as a mediator of a variety of biological responses in response to stimulation by specific growth _PROTEIN_ and cytokines . to understand better the role of _PROTEIN_ in the interferon induced phenotype we generated an active form of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by substituting cys residues for both arg and asn within the c terminal loop of the _PROTEIN_ domain . the ifn activation site element was stimulated and bound efficiently by _PROTEIN_ without ifn treatment . _PROTEIN_ was found to be tyrosine phosphorylated in the _LOCATION_ for more than h after ifn stimulation . _PROTEIN_ negative cells reexpressing _PROTEIN_ showed retarded cell growth and underwent apoptosis when treated with ifn . further analysis demonstrated that apoptosis was preceded by proteolytic cleavage of _PROTEIN_ and and wild type _PROTEIN_ also induced cleavage of _PROTEIN_ when _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ negative cells indicating that _PROTEIN_ augments potential activity of wild type _PROTEIN_ . studies with cycloheximide treatment showed that protein synthesis induced in the first h after ifn treatment was required for apoptosis under these conditions . finally we found that _PROTEIN_ induced apoptosis was in part mediated by _PROTEIN_ and because benzyloxycarbonyl valyl aspartyl valyl alanyl aspartic acid fluoromethyl ketone treatment partially blocked apoptosis . these results suggest that prolonged _LOCATION_ localization of activated _PROTEIN_ results in apoptosis involving specific regulation of _PROTEIN_ pathway .
generate active form of _PROTEIN_ has been shown that the introduction of two cys residues into ala and asn in the _PROTEIN_ domain produces a constitutively active form of _PROTEIN_ . we generated a mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by introducing cys residues into ala and asn in the domain which are equivalent to ala and asn of _PROTEIN_ . transcription activity of _PROTEIN_ was examined in the presence or absence of ifn using an reporter construct containing four copies of _PROTEIN_ binding sites upstream of the luciferase gene . _PROTEIN_ positive cells and _PROTEIN_ negative cells were transfected with an empty _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ vector together with for h and stimulated further by ng/ml ifn for h before measuring luciferase activity . as shown in fig . _PROTEIN_ activated the reporter fold after ifn treatment in cells an empty vector alone did not increase the activity because of a loss of endogenous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . significantly _PROTEIN_ alone activated the reporter plasmid fold and ifn treatment further enhanced the activity up to fold . in _PROTEIN_ positive cells luciferase activity was increased fold when vector alone was transfected and transfection of _PROTEIN_ enhanced the activity fold when treated with ifn . as shown in cells _PROTEIN_ alone activated the reporter plasmid fold an outcome enhanced by ifn treatment up to fold . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ alone can potentially activate a promoter containing _PROTEIN_ binding sites and that this activity is strongly enhanced by ifn stimulation . _PROTEIN_ shows increased tyrosine cells were stably transfected with _PROTEIN_ which has the _PROTEIN_ tag at the c terminus and _PROTEIN_ resistant clones were isolated for further analysis . among the clones obtained and clones were found to _PROTEIN_ similar levels of _PROTEIN_ protein with cells generated by stably _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in cells . it has been shown that tyrosine phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ tyr is essential for dimerization _LOCATION_ translocation and dna binding ability . to understand how tyr phosphorylation is involved in the strong transactivation activity of _PROTEIN_ we examined the phosphorylation status of tyr and the induction of a well characterized ifn target gene with or without treatment with the kinase inhibitor genistein which is frequently used for the inhibition of tyrosine kinases . genistein was added to the cell culture min after ifn stimulation and _LOCATION_ extracts were prepared for immunoblot analysis at min h h h h and h after ifn stimulation . the _PROTEIN_ level of _LOCATION_ transcription _PROTEIN_ was unchanged and it is shown as a loading control in fig . . although significant change in the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ protein level was not observed in cells tyr phosphorylation was transiently induced in these cells . _LOCATION_ localization and tyr phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ were undetectable in ifn stimulated cells when treated with genistein serving as a positive control of jak kinase inhibition by genistein . these results are consistent with the previous finding that tyr phosphorylation is required for _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ . interestingly was also induced in the presence of genistein in cells although induction was slightly weaker than untreated cells . these results suggest that low levels of _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ are sufficient for induction of . in and cells _PROTEIN_ was more _LOCATION_ than in even in the presence of genistein . although tyr phosphorylation was slightly _PROTEIN_ by genistein in both and cells it was significantly sustained for h after ifn stimulation even with genistein treatment implying that prolonged _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation is a consequence not of kinase hyperactivation but of a _PROTEIN_ dephosphorylation rate . consistent with the enhanced phosphorylation in tyr a remarkable induction of was sustained for h in and cells after ifn stimulation . interestingly high _PROTEIN_ of was also detected in genistein treated cells . these results suggest that ifn induced tyr phosphorylation is protected from _LOCATION_ phosphatase activity by the reinforced interaction of the domain through the cys cys bond . increased dna binding ability of _PROTEIN_ dna binding activity of _PROTEIN_ protein was studied using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay . normally growing and cells were treated with ifn for and min and cell extracts were subjected to electrophoretic mobility shift assay using a labeled _PROTEIN_ binding dna element as a probe . wild type _PROTEIN_ showed increased dna binding after min of treatment which gradually _PROTEIN_ in min . the basal dna binding ability of _PROTEIN_ was higher than that of wild type and was remarkably increased and sustained for more than min after ifn stimulation . specific binding of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to the probe was confirmed by a competition assay using an unlabeled dna probe . cell extracts were prepared from unstimulated or stimulated cells and an excess amount of unlabeled dna probe was added to the extracts . consistent with the results in fig . _PROTEIN_ was found to bind dna more efficiently than wild type _PROTEIN_ without ifn treatment . strong dna binding ability of _PROTEIN_ was induced in min and it disappeared after administration of an excess dna probe confirming that _PROTEIN_ specifically recognizes the gas element . specific binding of _PROTEIN_ to gas element was confirmed further with antibodies recognizing _PROTEIN_ in gel shift assay . in cells _PROTEIN_ binding to gas element was supershifted with anti _PROTEIN_ antibody but not affected with anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . enhanced dna binding of _PROTEIN_ was supershifted with antibodies for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or both because _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ tagged at the c terminus . consistent with results in fig . dna binding signals were completed with excess probe not with unrelated cold probe . these results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ contains a dna binding ability similar to that of wild type _PROTEIN_ but it is further enhanced by ifn treatment . _PROTEIN_ shows antiproliferative studied the biological activity of _PROTEIN_ on cell growth by comparing its effects with those of wild type _PROTEIN_ . exponentially growing and cells were plated at cm plate . after h ifn was added to the medium and the cells were counted at different times during a day interval . no significant differences in growth rate were observed between untreated or ifn treated or cells . in contrast and cells showed striking growth retardation h after stimulation compared with untreated and cells . this growth retardation was also observed when a lower concentration of ifn was used . cell morphology was analyzed by phase contrast microscopy of and cells treated with ifn for h . each cell line showed indistinguishable morphology before treatment but and cells detached from the plate after h of ifn treatment and showed condensed _LOCATION_ characteristic of cultured cells undergoing apoptosis . although previous studies demonstrated that and _PROTEIN_ reconstituted cells show the apoptosis phenotype in h after ifn treatment and cells did not show apoptosis after the same treatment within h in our experiments . these results suggest that enhanced _PROTEIN_ activity results in cell death after ifn treatment . _PROTEIN_ sensitizes cells to apoptosis by ifn further quantified apoptosis of _PROTEIN_ cells induced by ifn treatment . and cells were plated at cm plate respectively . after h cells were stimulated with ng/ml ifn for h. collected cells were then stained with propidium iodide and fluorescein isothiocyanate labeled annexin v a marker of an early stage of apoptosis and were analyzed by means of _METHOD_ activated cell sorter . apoptosis of or cells did not an increase by h of ifn treatment . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and cells showed slightly high levels of apoptosis without ifn treatment but increased cell death was observed at h after ifn treatment . as a positive control of apoptosis hydroxyperoxide treatment of and cells resulted in and frequency of apoptosis respectively in h. these results confirm that _PROTEIN_ can sensitize cells to ifn induced apoptosis . we next tested whether de novo protein synthesis is required for apoptosis by using the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide . chx was added to the cell cultures at and h after ifn stimulation . at h after ifn stimulation cells were collected and divided into two aliquots one for _METHOD_ activated cell sorter analysis and the other for immunoblot of _PROTEIN_ and tubulin . when chx was added to the cell culture after h of ifn treatment cells did not show apoptosis . however when cells were exposed to ifn for h chx did not prevent the cells from undergoing apoptosis . treatment with chx alone resulted in the intermediate rate of apoptosis only at h . to avoid the possibility that this inhibition of apoptosis was the result of a _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ as a result of chx treatment _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was confirmed by immunoblot with anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . these results support the hypotheses that _PROTEIN_ can transmit apoptosis signals apoptosis is not an immediate response to ifn treatment but it is dependent on de novo protein synthesis during the first h after stimulation . such protein synthesis is conceivably regulated by _PROTEIN_ . cleavage of _PROTEIN_ and in ifn treated _PROTEIN_ studies in caenorhabditis elegans defined an evolutionarily conserved apoptosis pathway including activation of cysteine proteases called _PROTEIN_ . once activated these proteases cleave specific intracellular substrates leading to cell death . we sought to determine whether specific activation of _PROTEIN_ is involved in ifn induced apoptosis of and cells . and cells were treated with ifn for or h. total cell lysates were studied by immunoblot analysis using anti _PROTEIN_ and antibodies that recognize the full length and/or cleaved _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ . a strong increase in _PROTEIN_ protein was observed in ifn treated and cells although previous studies had showed that the mrna level of _PROTEIN_ is increased in a _PROTEIN_ dependent manner in response to ifn stimulation . cleaved _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ and were specifically detected in and cells from to h of ifn treatment whereas no cleaved _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ and were detected in or cells . to rule out the possibility that this _PROTEIN_ activation and apoptosis are induced only in _PROTEIN_ cells we studied also hela cells _PROTEIN_ wild type _PROTEIN_ because it has been reported that ifn treatment can induce _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and apoptosis particularly _PROTEIN_ in serum medium . as shown in fig . ifn treatment induced full length _PROTEIN_ in serum and _PROTEIN_ in both and serum medium when hela cells were treated with ifn for h. significantly cleaved _METHOD_ of both _PROTEIN_ and were also immunodetected in ifn treated hela cells . induction showed that the ifn pathway is intact in hela cells . we further examined whether cells that are transiently transfected with an empty vector _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ vectors can activate _PROTEIN_ pathway when treated with ifn . induction of _PROTEIN_ by wt and and cleavage of _PROTEIN_ by wt were not detected in this transfection assay perhaps because of low transfection efficiency because stable transfectants of and cells showed strong induction and cleavage of both _PROTEIN_ . nevertheless cleavage of _PROTEIN_ was detected in transient transfection of wt and cleavage of _PROTEIN_ and was detected in transfection of . these results indicate that activation of _PROTEIN_ pathway by ifn is not specific in _PROTEIN_ cells but is generally observed in ifn treated cells . partial inhibition of apoptosis by z vdvad the basis of the observation described above we attempted to determine whether _PROTEIN_ mediated apoptosis specifically involves the _PROTEIN_ pathway . as shown in fig . cells were grown in normal medium with ifn alone and/or z vdvad fmk which specifically inhibits _PROTEIN_ and to a lesser degree _PROTEIN_ and . cell morphology and annexin v staining were studied after h. apoptosis of cells by ifn was partially inhibited by coincubation with z vdvad fmk . these results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ and perhaps _PROTEIN_ and are partially involved in _PROTEIN_ mediated apoptosis .
