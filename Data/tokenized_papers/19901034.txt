sugars play indispensable roles in biological reactions and are distributed into various tissues or organelles via transporters in plants . under abiotic stress conditions plants accumulate sugars as a means to increase stress tolerance . here we report an abiotic stress inducible transporter for monosaccharides from arabidopsis thaliana that is termed _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was induced under drought and high salinity conditions and with exogenous application of abscisic acid . promoter analyses using _PROTEIN_ and green _METHOD_ protein reporters revealed that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in pericycle and xylem parenchyma cells . the _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein fused protein was detected at tonoplast in transgenic arabidopsis plants and tobacco by cells . furthermore alanine scanning mutagenesis revealed that an n terminal lxxxll motif in _PROTEIN_ was essential for its localization at the tonoplast . transgenic by cells _PROTEIN_ mutated _PROTEIN_ which was localized at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ showed an uptake ability for monosaccharides . moreover the value of km for _PROTEIN_ uptake activity of mutated _PROTEIN_ in the transgenic by cells was extraordinarily high and the transport activity was independent from a proton gradient . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is a low affinity facilitated diffusion transporter . finally we detected that _LOCATION_ invertase activity was increased under abiotic stress conditions and the _PROTEIN_ patterns of _LOCATION_ invertase genes were similar to that of _PROTEIN_ . under abiotic stress conditions _PROTEIN_ might function coordinately with the _LOCATION_ invertase to regulate osmotic pressure by affecting the accumulation of sugar in plant cells .
supplemental fig . presents a phylogenic tree based on the amino acid sequences of arabidopsis proteins exhibiting homology to the monosaccharide transporter _PROTEIN_ human _PROTEIN_ transporters and a myo inositol transporter . seven families of monosaccharide transporters exist in arabidopsis including the member _LOCATION_ like family as the largest monosaccharide transporter family in arabidopsis . _LOCATION_ was isolated from an arabidopsis cdna library from plants that were exposed to drought stress for h . a cdna of a homologous _LOCATION_ like family gene was isolated from sugar beet by pcr based cloning . in addition we found _LOCATION_ like family homologous genes in various plant species from genbanktm in dicots such as barrel medic and grape vine _PROTEIN_ in monocots such as rice and corn in _METHOD_ such as sitka spruce and in moss such as physcomitrella patens . the _LOCATION_ like family shows low homology to any previously characterized arabidopsis monosaccharide transporters . however they exhibited high homology to mammalian _PROTEIN_ transporters especially and . from a phylogenic analysis of the _LOCATION_ like family in arabidopsis we identified a close homologue of _LOCATION_ which we named _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ . analysis of _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ revealed putative transmembrane domains and conserved sequences among the major facilitated superfamily as well as all previously characterized monosaccharide transporters . an n glycosylation site in loop a feature shared between and was not found in _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ . to examine the physiological functions of _LOCATION_ and those of _PROTEIN_ under abiotic stresses we initially analyzed their _PROTEIN_ patterns under abiotic stress conditions and aba treatment with rna gel blot hybridization . in good accordance to a previous study maximal accumulation of _LOCATION_ mrna was detected after and h of exposure to drought stress . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was induced within h and was strongly _PROTEIN_ after h under abiotic stresses . aba treatment had a converse effect on the _PROTEIN_ patterns of _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ . accumulation of the _PROTEIN_ mrna was increased after h in aba treatment whereas that of _LOCATION_ was _PROTEIN_ . we next investigated the changes of the _PROTEIN_ in leaves and roots under high salinity and aba treatment by qrt pcr analysis . the _PROTEIN_ level of _LOCATION_ was similar in both leaves and roots under normal conditions . however its _PROTEIN_ in leaves was _PROTEIN_ after exposure to the high salinity and aba treatment whereas root _PROTEIN_ levels were not reduced . on the other hand _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was higher in roots than in leaves under normal conditions . the mrna accumulation of _PROTEIN_ in roots under the high salinity and aba treatment was also higher than that in leaves . these results were in good accordance with the data from the public microarray data base . to determine the histological _PROTEIN_ profiles of _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ we first generated _LOCATION_ gus and _PROTEIN_ gus transgenic plants . gus _PROTEIN_ was detected in both shoots and roots of the _LOCATION_ gus and _PROTEIN_ gus plants . in flowers gus staining was detected in sepals of the _LOCATION_ gus and _PROTEIN_ gus plants . furthermore in _LOCATION_ gus plants gus staining was observed in epidermal and cortex cells of roots and was especially strong in cortex cells . on the other hand in _PROTEIN_ gus plants gus staining was strongly detected in pericycle and xylem parenchyma cells of roots and also detected in the root endodermis . as our next approach we generated _LOCATION_ tm _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ tm _METHOD_ transgenic plants . tm _METHOD_ is a _LOCATION_ localized _METHOD_ fused to the n terminal half of the monosaccharide transporter _PROTEIN_ . although free _METHOD_ diffuses through plasmodesmata tm _METHOD_ does not diffuse for being localized at _LOCATION_ . in the root tips and the mature region of roots _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ detected in epidermal and cortex cells of the _LOCATION_ tm _METHOD_ plants and it was strongly detected in pericycle and xylem parenchyma cells of the _PROTEIN_ tm _METHOD_ plants . the results of the promoter tm _METHOD_ plants were coincident with those of promoter gus plants . _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ showed differences in _PROTEIN_ patterns and histological localizations . these results suggest that _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ may have different physiological functions . a number of abiotic stress inducible genes have been identified in various plant species and the products of these genes function in abiotic stress responses and tolerance . the induction pattern of _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ under abiotic stress conditions was similar to those of abiotic stress inducible genes . therefore we focused our functional characterization on _PROTEIN_ in this study . the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ was studied in arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts that transiently _PROTEIN_ a _METHOD_ fused _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ driven by the promoter revealing the localization at the tonoplast . co localization of signals at the tonoplast was also observed when _PROTEIN_ with the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ tonoplast marker . we next established transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed at tonoplasts and vesicular structures . which is a mammalian homologue of the _LOCATION_ like family is localized at the _PROTEIN_ endosome or the lysosome . contains an n terminal acidic di leucine motif exxxl . when this motif was mutated was mislocalized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . interestingly we noted that most of the transporters in the _LOCATION_ like family also contain a di leucine or a tri leucine sequence in their n termini . for the case of _PROTEIN_ it contained a tri leucine sequence in its n terminus . stemming from the observations gained from mammalian studies we hypothesized that di leucine or tri leucine sequences in the n termini of _LOCATION_ like transporters also determine their subcellular localizations . as a result we generated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in which the tri leucine of _PROTEIN_ was mutated into a tri alanine . _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized to many vesicular structures and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and not at the tonoplast in arabidopsis plants and tobacco by suspension cells . the lipophilic styryl dye is known as an endocytic marker . this dye is transferred from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ via endosomes to the _LOCATION_ when exogenously added to plant cells . we tried to use this dye as a means to analyze the localizations of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . fifteen min after the addition of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed only weak co localization with the positive endosomes in arabidopsis root cells . in contrast the majority of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals were co stained with . furthermore we analyzed the effects of vesicle trafficking inhibitors wortmannin and brefeldin a . wm is an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol oh kinase and bfa is a fungal toxin that inhibits the guanine nucleotide exchange _PROTEIN_ . in arabidopsis root cells wm leads to the vacuolation of endosomes such as the prevacuolar compartment or multivesicular body . bfa causes the trans _LOCATION_ network or early endosome to aggregate with the and they are located inside an aberrant compartment . under wm treatment we detected wm compartments in both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants . however we detected bfa compartments in only _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants under bfa treatment . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are localized at different intracellular compartments . thus the n terminal tri leucine sequence of _PROTEIN_ plays a functional role for its subcellular sorting signal . we next performed alanine scanning mutagenesis in the n terminal region containing the tri leucine sequence to identify the critical residues for the tonoplast localization of _PROTEIN_ . in transgenic by cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ appeared to be localized _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ whereas _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . thus the lxxxll motif was essential for _PROTEIN_ to be sorted to the tonoplast in plant cells . to verify whether _PROTEIN_ is a functional monosaccharide transporter we generated transgenic by cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . however a similar level of _PROTEIN_ was observed in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells and vector control cells . we suspected that the lack of transporter activity was due to the tonoplast localization of _PROTEIN_ . therefore we subsequently established transgenic by cells _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized _PROTEIN_ . in contrast to the aforementioned results these cells exhibited significantly higher _PROTEIN_ uptake activity relative to vector control cells . we then analyzed the kinetics of _PROTEIN_ transport activity of _PROTEIN_ using the substrate concentration between and mm . because by cells exhibited a naturally high background of _PROTEIN_ uptake ability we calculated the net activities of _PROTEIN_ which were determined by the subtracted values of _PROTEIN_ uptake of vector control cells from those of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells . km and vmax values of _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ were mm and nmol mg fresh respectively . table shows the sensitivities of _PROTEIN_ dependent transport to competitors or an inhibitor . the uptake of _PROTEIN_ was significantly inhibited by hexoses such as _PROTEIN_ fructose galactose and mannose and a pentose with _PROTEIN_ showing the highest level of inhibition . the addition of linear or circular polyols _PROTEIN_ and disaccharides did not affect the _PROTEIN_ uptake activity of _PROTEIN_ . furthermore reduction of the proton gradient caused by the protonophore did not have any effect on the transport activity of _PROTEIN_ cells although _PROTEIN_ uptake activity of vector control cells was inhibited by adding cccp . these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ functions as a low affinity facilitated diffusion transporter for monosaccharides . to determine the physiological role of _PROTEIN_ in plant cells it is important to have an understanding _PROTEIN_ the amount of hexose in _LOCATION_ . invertases are considered as key enzymes to convert sucrose into _PROTEIN_ and fructose . degradation of sucrose by _LOCATION_ invertase is one of the sources for _LOCATION_ hexose . we then analyzed _LOCATION_ invertase activity under abiotic stress conditions . we measured the _LOCATION_ and cell wall bound invertase activity when arabidopsis plants were exposed to abiotic stresses or aba treatment for h. _LOCATION_ invertase activity for soluble acid invertases was increased under abiotic stress conditions and aba treatment . particularly _LOCATION_ invertase activity under drought and aba treatments was higher than that under high salinity conditions . cell wall bound invertase activity for insoluble acid invertases did not change . these results suggest that hexoses were accumulated in the _LOCATION_ under exposure to abiotic stress conditions . there are two _LOCATION_ invertase genes in arabidopsis . we analyzed the _PROTEIN_ patterns of those genes under abiotic stress conditions . the transcript level of increased after exposure to h of drought and aba treatments and exposure to h of high salinity . at the h time point the mrna accumulation of under drought and aba treatment was also higher than that under the high salinity condition . these results showed positive correlation between mrna accumulation and the activity of _LOCATION_ invertases . moreover we investigated the _PROTEIN_ of the _LOCATION_ invertase genes in leaves and roots . the _PROTEIN_ of was _PROTEIN_ detected in roots . the mrna induction pattern of in leaves and roots was similar to that of _PROTEIN_ under high salinity and aba treatment . on the other hand the _PROTEIN_ of was _PROTEIN_ detected in leaves . according to data from the public microarray data base the histological _PROTEIN_ patterns of the _LOCATION_ invertase genes were partially overlapped with that of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ might coordinately function with the _LOCATION_ invertases in those cells in which both _PROTEIN_ and the _LOCATION_ invertase genes are _PROTEIN_ . we identified a mutant line carrying a t dna insertion in the fifth exon of the _PROTEIN_ gene . the t dna insertional mutant which we designated as _PROTEIN_ was a knock out mutant because the _PROTEIN_ mrna was not accumulated in _PROTEIN_ . we observed no differences between the root lengths of this mutant and those of wild type plants under high salinity conditions . the _LOCATION_ like family is the largest monosaccharide transporter family in arabidopsis containing genes . it is possible that additional genes in the _LOCATION_ like family may function redundantly with _PROTEIN_ .
