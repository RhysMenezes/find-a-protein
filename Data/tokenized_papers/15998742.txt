agrobacterium tumefaciens infects plants and induces the formation of tumors called crown galls by integrating the transferred dna region of the ti plasmid into the plant _LOCATION_ genome . tumors are formed because the t dna encodes enzymes that modify the synthesis of two plant growth hormones auxin and cytokinin _PROTEIN_ . here we show that a _PROTEIN_ biosynthesis enzyme tmr which is encoded by the agrobacterium t dna region is targeted to and functions in _LOCATION_ of infected plant cells despite having no typical _LOCATION_ targeting sequence . evidence is provided that tmr is an adenosine phosphate isopentenyltransferase that creates a new _PROTEIN_ biosynthesis bypass by using hydroxy methyl butenyl diphosphate as a substrate . unlike in the conventional _PROTEIN_ biosynthesis pathway in plants trans zeatin type _PROTEIN_ are produced directly without the requirement for monooxygenase mediated hydroxylation . consistent with the _LOCATION_ localization of tmr hmbdp is an intermediate in the methylerythritol phosphate pathway a _LOCATION_ localized biosynthesis route for universal isoprenoid precursors . these results demonstrate that a. tumefaciens modifies _PROTEIN_ biosynthesis by sending a key enzyme into _LOCATION_ of the host plant to promote tumorigenesis .
substrate preference of ipts . to investigate how the agrobacterium tmr modifies _PROTEIN_ biosynthesis in plant cells we first determined the k m values of tmr for dmapp and hmbdp by using the recombinant protein produced in escherichia coli . table shows that tmr transferred both dmapp and hmbdp to amp with similar k m values . this result suggests that tmr may function in both the iprmp dependent and independent pathways in agrobacterium infected plant cells . unlike tmr recombinant _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ did not use hmbdp as a substrate in combination with any of adenosine phosphates . there are nine ipt related sequences in the arabidopsis genome . among them _PROTEIN_ and are likely to function as _PROTEIN_ biosynthesis enzymes because others are involved in the prenylation of trna or do not encode a functional ipt in some arabidopsis ecotypes . we have previously shown that _PROTEIN_ and are localized to _LOCATION_ when produced as fusion proteins with _METHOD_ in arabidopsis cells whereas _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were detected in the _LOCATION_ and mitochondria respectively . because it was difficult to obtain all atipts as soluble recombinant proteins we analyzed _PROTEIN_ species accumulated in transgenic arabidopsis lines overexpressing each ipt under the control of a dexamethasone inducible promoter to deduce the substrate preference . as reported overexpression of tmr in arabidopsis resulted in accumulation of tz type _PROTEIN_ at extremely high levels without increasing the level of ip type _PROTEIN_ substantially . in contrast to the effect of tmr overexpression a large number of ip type _PROTEIN_ accumulated in arabidopsis seedlings when one of the native ipt genes _PROTEIN_ was overexpressed . predominant accumulation of ip nucleotides in _PROTEIN_ overexpressing arabidopsis was also reported . induction of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ did not increase the level of any _PROTEIN_ species because it catalyzes prenylation of trna . these results suggest that atipts principally use dmapp but not hmbdp for the biosynthesis of _PROTEIN_ in planta _PROTEIN_ of their subcellular localization . in contrast the major substrate for tmr is likely to be hmbdp when overexpressed in arabidopsis . in vivo labeling experiments . although hmbdp has been a likely intermediate in the iprmp independent pathway and it does serve as a substrate for tmr there is no direct evidence that hmbdp is a precursor for _PROTEIN_ in any organism in vivo . to address this problem we designed in vivo tracer experiments using dx and dx . from dx would be incorporated through the mep pathway into hmbdp but not into dmapp . on the other hand dx would label both hmbdp and dmapp with . each of these labeled precursors was fed to arabidopsis seedlings in the presence of kc which blocks the endogenous mep pathway to allow efficient labeling . to examine whether tmr uses hmbdp in planta we fed labeled dx to transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ tmr under the control of a dexamethasone inducible promoter . liquid chromatography _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis demonstrated that was incorporated into tz type _PROTEIN_ from dx when tmr was overexpressed in arabidopsis seedlings . however only from dx but not from dx was incorporated into tz derivatives without tmr _PROTEIN_ . these results illustrate that tmr uses hmbdp as a substrate in arabidopsis seedlings whereas this bypass does not occur at a detectable level without the engineered induction of tmr in our experimental conditions . to further confirm this notion we carried out in vivo labeling experiments using transgenic arabidopsis plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ . as was the case with wild type plants only from dx but not from dx was incorporated into tz nucleotides in the _PROTEIN_ overexpressor supporting the idea that dmapp is the major substrate for _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . to investigate whether hmbdp is used for tz synthesis in plants upon agrobacterium infection _PROTEIN_ biosynthesis in a cultured crown gall cell line of periwinkle was examined . cells contain an integration of the agrobacterium t dna but they are free of bacteria unlike natural crown galls . liquid chromatography _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis showed that a large fraction of tz type _PROTEIN_ was labeled with when dx was fed in the presence of kc . a high incorporation rate of dx into tzrmp indicates that hmbdp is the major source of prenyl side chain of tz derivatives in the crown gall cells . in contrast incorporation was not observed in another periwinkle cell line cra which does not possess a t dna integration . to examine the occurrence of the hmbdp pathway in natural crown galls we inoculated wild type agrobacterium onto tomato plants . the resulting galls were injected with dx . from galls induced by two independent agrobacterium isolates we were able to detect incorporation into tzrmp indicating that the hmbdp pathway operates in crown galls in nature . subcellular localization of tmr in arabidopsis . because hmbdp is a metabolic intermediate in the mep pathway tmr should exist in _LOCATION_ to use hmbdp as a substrate . to determine the subcellular localization of tmr a series of tmr _METHOD_ fusion genes were transiently _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis root cells . as the control markers for _LOCATION_ and mitochondria arabidopsis geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase and were used respectively . consistent with the use of hmbdp by tmr in the mep pathway _METHOD_ from the full length tmr _METHOD_ was localized to _LOCATION_ . deletion analyses showed that the amino terminal aa were sufficient to drive the fusion protein to _LOCATION_ . a removal of aa at the amino terminus was found to abolish the _LOCATION_ localization . this region _METHOD_ to be necessary for both the catalysis and the _LOCATION_ translocation because it contains a putative p loop motif and a conserved aspartate residue essential for the activity . when _METHOD_ was fused to the amino terminus of tmr the fusion protein did not localize to the _LOCATION_ suggesting the necessity of the intact amino terminus for its _LOCATION_ localization . anti tmr antibodies were used to analyze subcellular localization of tmr in protein extracts from stable transformants _PROTEIN_ tmr . immunoblot analysis showed that tmr was detected in a chloroplast enriched fraction that is marked by the presence and absence of _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ localized glutamine synthetase _METHOD_ respectively . subcellular localization of tmr in crown gall cells . to examine whether tmr is localized to _LOCATION_ in crown galls intact _LOCATION_ were purified from the cell line and cra of periwinkle . tmr was enriched in the _LOCATION_ fraction relative to the total cell extract as was the case with ferredoxin used as a _LOCATION_ marker . we confirmed that marker proteins for the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and mitochondria were not enriched in the _LOCATION_ fraction . to assess suborganellar localization of tmr in the cells isolated _LOCATION_ were exposed to trypsin or thermolysin . these proteinases have different penetrability to _LOCATION_ envelopes and are useful to assess the location of _LOCATION_ proteins . unlike envelope marker proteins that were sensitive to trypsin or both trypsin and thermolysin _PROTEIN_ tmr and ferredoxin were resistant to these proteases but were sensitive to triton x which destroys the organelle _LOCATION_ structure . these data indicate that tmr is localized to the stroma of _LOCATION_ in crown gall cells .
