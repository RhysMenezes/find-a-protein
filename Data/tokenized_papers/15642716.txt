the arabidopsis thaliana genome contains approximately genes encoding basic leucine zipper transcription _PROTEIN_ divided into groups . abscisic acid insensitive _PROTEIN_ is one of the members of group a and is involved in aba signalling during seed maturation and germination . seven other members of this group are _PROTEIN_ during seed maturation but only one of them _PROTEIN_ has been functionally characterized during this developmental phase . since _PROTEIN_ and two other group a genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ display similar mrna temporal _PROTEIN_ in whole siliques it is suspected that they might share some overlapping functions . to address this question the proteins tissular and subcellular localization in transgenic arabidopsis were precisely characterized using translational fusions with a green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ under the corresponding _PROTEIN_ promoter . it was found that the three fusion proteins were _PROTEIN_ with a largely overlapping pattern and constitutively localized in the _LOCATION_ . an rna interference approach was then used to knock out the _PROTEIN_ of all three genes simultaneously . endogenous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts could be specifically reduced but no visible defects could be observed during seed maturation .
a versatile binary vector was built first to allow _PROTEIN_ of translational fusion between any protein and a soluble version of _METHOD_ under the control of any promoter of interest . for this a small multiple cloning site the _METHOD_ coding sequence a gateway recombination cassette and a transcriptional terminator was assembled . any promoter can be inserted in the multiple cloning site and cdnas can be recombined in frame with the _METHOD_ sequence . this strategy was applied to the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes thereby generating four constructs designated _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ vector as well as the feasibility of this approach in embryos using a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct were tested first . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pattern and subcellular location had been characterized _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ peaks at the end of seed maturation and the _PROTEIN_ protein appears to be constitutively localized in the _LOCATION_ . a construct containing bp of the _PROTEIN_ promoter upstream of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion was introduced into wild type arabidopsis and its _PROTEIN_ was analysed during seed development . in these conditions seed maturation occurs between d and d after pollination dap corresponding to the dry seed stage . and dap embryos from two independent _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ lines were dissected out of the seed coat . as shown in fig . bright green spots were detected in both the axis and cotyledons from the transgenic embryos . some smaller spots were also visible . however they appeared both in transgenic and wild type plants . the coincidence of these green spots with chlorophyll emission suggested they correspond to the chloroplasts own _METHOD_ . the brighter and bigger spots are only seen in transgenic plants and do not overlap with chlorophyll . it was concluded that they represent the _METHOD_ signal . the form and localization of these spots in the cell strongly suggest they correspond to _LOCATION_ . this hypothesis was confirmed by co localization of this signal with _METHOD_ from the dna specific dye di hydroethidium . the _LOCATION_ localization depends on the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence as _METHOD_ alone _PROTEIN_ under the same _PROTEIN_ promoter is located both in the _LOCATION_ and the cytoplasm . these experiments established the functionality of the _PROTEIN_ vector and demonstrated that it can be used to analyse protein _PROTEIN_ in embryos . this vector was then used for similar constructs using the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ promoters and cdnas . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes have been characterized previously and are known to be _PROTEIN_ in maturing embryos . however no information about the protein localization in the embryo has been presented . the _METHOD_ of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusions was observed in maturing embryos for all _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ constructs . none of the three constructs generated _METHOD_ in the embryos before dap . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was first detected in the cotyledons and axis of dap embryos whereas _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ appeared d _PROTEIN_ in the whole embryo for _PROTEIN_ but only in the cotyledons for _PROTEIN_ . from dap to dap _METHOD_ was then detected for the three _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ throughout the embryo in both cotyledons and axis . at dap _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ persisted in the whole embryo whereas _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was restricted to cotyledons . finally at dap only _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ remained detectable whereas _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was no longer visible . no _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was detected in dry seeds . throughout their _PROTEIN_ window _METHOD_ was specifically detected in the _LOCATION_ indicating that all three proteins were constitutively _LOCATION_ . these results show that all three proteins are _PROTEIN_ during seed maturation with slightly different but overlapping _PROTEIN_ patterns suggesting they may perform overlapping functions . for this reason an attempt was made to silence the _PROTEIN_ of all three genes simultaneously using an rna interference approach . an attempt to silence the three _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes was made by assembling three bp dna fragments amplified from specific regions of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes . the resulting concatemer was introduced as an inverted repeated fragment in the phannibal vector as shown on fig . to generate an rnai construct as described by wesley et al . . twenty two independent rnai lines were generated . to select those displaying the most efficient silencing each of them was crossed to the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ line described above . the rnai construct is supposed to trigger the degradation of the endogenous transcript as well as any chimeric transcript containing the targeted sequence . as the rnai effect is dominant efficient rnai lines should trigger the degradation of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transcript and the loss of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the progeny of the cross . this test enabled selection of the most efficient rnai lines . as shown in fig . some rnai lines such as led to a poor diminution of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the embryo whereas others such as or led to a severe reduction of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . however this _METHOD_ loss is not complete and some signal could still be detected in the root tip of the embryo . crossing of and lines to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ lines gave similar results . this _METHOD_ loss could not be observed by crossing these lines to the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ line showing that the silencing is specific for the three targeted _PROTEIN_ genes . to test whether the silencing could also be observed at the mrna level the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was monitored by rt pcr in the and homozygous rnai lines . as shown in fig . the level of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts seemed poorly affected in the siliques of the rnai line while it was significantly _PROTEIN_ in the line . all three transcripts appeared similarly reduced in the line whereas the _PROTEIN_ transcript level was not affected . it is thus possible to trigger a specific reduction of the _PROTEIN_ of three _PROTEIN_ homologous genes by an rnai approach using a single transgene . no macroscopic defects could be observed in the seeds of the line . the aba sensitivity of the rnai homozygous lines and is similar to the wild type . these rnai lines do not seem to be either hypersensitive or insensitive to aba . moreover the above mentioned germination tests were performed on seeds after a few weeks of drying and the germination rate was always similar to the wild type indicating that desiccation tolerance was not drastically affected as in the _PROTEIN_ severe alleles . to get an insight of the molecular targets of these rnai lines the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene was assayed using semi quantitative rt pcr on total rna extracted from dap and rnai seeds and no significant difference could be detected compared with the wild type seeds . in addition to this rnai homozygous lines and were crossed to the _PROTEIN_ reporter line and no ectopic or precocious gus staining could be detected in the progeny of the cross showing that there is no dominant effect on the regulation of _PROTEIN_ . by contrast with the the eel mutant there is no earlier or stronger _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the rnai seeds . this difference can be either due to residual _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ transcript or antagonistic effect of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ loss . however a more extended molecular characterization would need to be performed to assay other possible molecular targets .
