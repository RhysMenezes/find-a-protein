cell reproduction is a complex process involving whole cell structures and machineries in space and time resulting in regulated distribution of endomembranes organelles and genomes between daughter cells . secretory pathways supported by the activity of the _LOCATION_ apparatus play a crucial role in cytokinesis in plants . from the onset of phragmoplast initiation to the maturation of the cell plate delivery of secretory vesicles is necessary to sustain successful daughter cell separation . tethering of secretory vesicles at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ is mediated by the evolutionarily conserved octameric exocyst complex . using proteomic and cytologic approaches we show that _PROTEIN_ is a subunit of the plant exocyst . arabidopsis thaliana mutants for _PROTEIN_ are severely dwarfed and have compromised leaf epidermal cell and guard cell division . during cytokinesis green _METHOD_ protein tagged exocyst subunits _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ exhibit distinctive localization maxima at cell plate initiation and cell plate maturation stages with a high demand for vesicle fusion . finally we present data indicating a defect in cell plate assembly in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . we conclude that the exocyst complex is involved in secretory processes during cytokinesis in arabidopsis cells notably in cell plate initiation cell plate maturation and formation of new primary cell wall .
the arabidopsis genome encodes three _PROTEIN_ paralogs . we focused our work _PROTEIN_ on _PROTEIN_ as the only paralog whose mutation produced a readily discernible developmental phenotype . we previously reported that the full length _PROTEIN_ strongly autoactivates the reporter genes in the based yeast two hybrid system thus hampering analysis of its interactors . to overcome this we prepared constructs derived from n and c terminal domains of _PROTEIN_ to test its interactions with other exocyst subunits . the n terminal domain strongly interacted with _PROTEIN_ both as bait and prey and weakly interacted as bait with _PROTEIN_ . on the other hand the c terminal domain of _PROTEIN_ exhibited weak interactions with itself and as bait with _PROTEIN_ . we further demonstrated the association of _PROTEIN_ with other exocyst subunits by coimmunoprecipitation in transgenic arabidopsis lines constitutively _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tagged on the c terminus with green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . after immunoprecipitation using the anti _METHOD_ antibody we detected _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in bands excised from the polyacrylamide gel these bands were not present in wild type and free _METHOD_ controls . in addition _PROTEIN_ and another subunit _PROTEIN_ were also identified in the coimmunoprecipitate using specific antibodies . we conclude that _PROTEIN_ interacts directly at least with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the exocyst subunits _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were coimmunoprecipitated as a part of a complex possibly the entire exocyst complex . we characterized two t dna insertion mutant alleles _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the self crossed progeny of heterozygous plants segregated and respectively of dwarf plants that were confirmed by pcr genotyping to be homozygous for their respective t dna insertions . no full length _PROTEIN_ transcript was detected in either of the lines by rt pcr . the phenotypic defect of the _PROTEIN_ homozygous plants was more severe than that of _PROTEIN_ homozygotes we speculated that the _PROTEIN_ allele transcript could be spliced correctly at low frequency . however we were unable to detect the full length transcript even when the rt pcr cycle number was increased to . to confirm that the observed phenotypic defects are indeed caused by mutations in the _PROTEIN_ locus we complemented both mutant alleles with the _PROTEIN_ protein fused to _METHOD_ . we used _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs to complement _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines respectively . the complemented homozygous plants of both alleles exhibited wild type appearance . these results together with the finding that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ coimmunoprecipitated the other exocyst subunits suggest that the c terminal _METHOD_ tag does not interfere with _PROTEIN_ function and the fusion protein is able to complement the _PROTEIN_ phenotypic defects . the uncomplemented _PROTEIN_ homozygotes were sterile with extremely reduced stature . true leaves were angular with small and irregularly developed trichomes or with trichome subsidiary cells without a trichome present . the leaf surface of both _PROTEIN_ lines showed defects in epidermal cell expansion _PROTEIN_ jigsaw puzzle interlocking and a high number of collapsed cells . on the cellular level the leaf epidermis of both mutant lines contained cell wall stubs . there were two types of cell wall stubs short stubs bulging from the periphery of the cell and long cell walls stubs spanning nearly the whole cell width . occasionally aberrant star like cell plates stretched in the center of a cell were observed . none of these deviations were observed in wild type controls . when abaxial sides of true leaves of d old seedlings were examined the cell wall stubs were detected in of _PROTEIN_ cells and of _PROTEIN_ cells . cytokinetic defects were obvious in stomata development . we documented that d old leaves of both _PROTEIN_ mutants contained morphologically defective stomata . their defects ranged from aberrant highly asymmetric stomata and stomata with imperfectly divided guard cells with incomplete ventral walls to single guard cells lacking any viable counterparts . by contrast we never found such deviations in wild type controls . the exocyst has been shown to be involved in the post _LOCATION_ secretion in fungi and animals . for example citation observed accumulation of secretory vesicles in yeast mutants . we examined leaves of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ mutants on the ultrastructural level using transmission electron microscopy . we focused on cells in the epidermis that were not fully vacuolated and contained dense cytoplasm . focusing on this cell type allowed an easy comparison of similar developmental stages between wild type and mutant leaf cells . in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant cells vesicles were dramatically accumulated in of cells examined and often contained fibrous electron dense material . in the wild type cells similar vesicle accumulation was not observed . instead vesicles were scattered around the _LOCATION_ apparatus . the epidermis of mutant leaves also contained electron dense presumably aborted cells that were stuffed with vesicles . these cells most likely correspond to the dead cells described above . however leaves of _PROTEIN_ mutants also possess cells morphologically similar to wild type cells pointing to a large spectrum of phenotypes observed in mutant leaves . to examine the _PROTEIN_ subcellular localization we used _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ stably transformed arabidopsis plants in which the _PROTEIN_ was driven by the constitutive promoter or by the native _PROTEIN_ promoter . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of either promoter decorated _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ weakly and strongly labeled postcytokinetic walls _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in leaf and root cells . in the case of the promoter we observed bright cortical particles of unknown identity probably caused by the constitutive promoter overexpression . to get deeper insight into the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ cytokinetic localization we aimed our attention at the root meristem of to d old arabidopsis seedlings as this tissue is easily accessible to live cell imaging and harbors frequent and predictably localized dividing cells . moreover citation reported no differences between cell plate formation in root and shoot meristematic cells . the driven _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was stronger than that of the native promoter but the dynamics and localization of both was similar . during cytokinesis the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was associated with the newly emerged cell plate and weakly with the growing cell plate . it started to substantially accumulate at the cell plate insertion site after the cell plate attached to the mother wall . the precise timing of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulation at the postcytokinetic wall was dependent on the mode of cell plate growth . in symmetrically growing cell plates _LOCATION_ the signal appeared at the moment of cell plate insertion or shortly after . in cell plates that were expanding asymmetrically and so their edge reached one side of the cell sooner than the other the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal usually localized at the insertion site only after fusion of both cell plate edges with the _LOCATION_ . subsequently the signal spread into the entire cell plate . the postcytokinetic wall signal was not homogeneous it showed fluctuating maxima . after completion of cytokinesis _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ remained associated with the postcytokinetic wall with its intensity _PROTEIN_ to the level of the surrounding cells in approximately one hour after its appearance . to learn whether the observed cytokinetic localization pattern is unique to _PROTEIN_ or is rather a feature of the exocyst complex we analyzed localizations of several other exocyst subunits during cytokinesis . we prepared arabidopsis lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tagged versions of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . all of them showed cytoplasmic localization weak _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ labeling and strong association with postcytokinetic walls . during the onset of cytokinesis _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ strongly associated with the cell plate at the moment of its emergence appearing as a localized flash of _METHOD_ lasting to s. during cell plate growth the signal _PROTEIN_ until reappearance at the time of cell plate insertion . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ under control of their native promoters and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was driven by the promoter . importantly both types of _PROTEIN_ yield identical localization and dynamics in cytokinesis . taken together these results reinforce our previous data suggesting that the plant exocyst acts as a complex and further argues that the exocyst complex and not solely _PROTEIN_ functions in cytokinesis . as the cytokinetic localization is shared among all exocyst subunits tested we asked whether cytokinesis is compromised in other exocyst mutants as well . another viable available arabidopsis exocyst mutant is _PROTEIN_ which has a less severe phenotypic defect than _PROTEIN_ mutants and does not exhibit the cytokinetic defects described in the case of _PROTEIN_ mutants . we analyzed cytokinesis in root tips of d old _PROTEIN_ mutants and wild type plants . root length of _PROTEIN_ mutants was reduced by _PROTEIN_ . to investigate whether the delay in cytokinesis might contribute to this difference we measured the time needed for cytokinesis completion . we labeled cell plates with and determined the time from cell plate appearance to cell plate straightening between the mother walls . we normalized time to the cell plate area obtaining a cell plate expansion rate . however there was no significant difference between _PROTEIN_ mutant plants and wild type controls . we further focused on the cell plate morphology especially around the moment of its appearance . we used three dimensional reconstruction of time lapsed series of confocal sections . in wild type root meristem cells the cell plate emerged in the middle of the cell typically as a filled circle or as a few small patches which quickly fused and gave rise to the cell plate . the cell plate arose from vesicles invisible in the confocal microscope . however in the _PROTEIN_ mutants the cell plate emerged by fusion of visible spots forming a donut shaped or horseshoe shaped structure with an empty space in its center . mutant cell plates further expanded not only centrifugally but also centripetally to fill the central gap . thus it was difficult to distinguish mutant and wild type cell plates in the _PROTEIN_ phase of their expansion . we classified the cell plate shape into three categories solid patchy and donut/horseshoe shaped and found that the dominant type in _PROTEIN_ mutants was the donut/horseshoe which was never observed in the wild type . unfortunately we were unable to perform a similar analysis with the _PROTEIN_ mutants due to their slow growth and infrequent cell divisions . however the few _PROTEIN_ cell plates we observed generally resembled that of the wild type . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is important in the initial cell plate assembly phases whereas the _PROTEIN_ centrifugal cell plate growth is likely unaffected by _PROTEIN_ deficiency .
