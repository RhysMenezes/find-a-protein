plant organ development is important for _PROTEIN_ to a changing environment . genetic and physiological studies have revealed that plant hormones play key roles in _PROTEIN_ root formation . in this study we show that mizu _PROTEIN_ which was identified originally as a regulator of hydrotropism functions as a novel regulator of hormonally mediated _PROTEIN_ root development . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in roots resulted in a reduced number of _PROTEIN_ roots being formed however this defect could be recovered with the application of auxin . indole acetic acid quantification analyses showed that free indole acetic acid levels _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ roots which indicates that alteration of auxin level is critical for the inhibition of _PROTEIN_ root formation in _PROTEIN_ plants . in addition _PROTEIN_ negatively regulates cytokinin sensitivity on root development . application of cytokinin strongly induced the localization of _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein to _PROTEIN_ root primordia which suggests that the inhibition of _PROTEIN_ root development by _PROTEIN_ occurs downstream of cytokinin signaling . surprisingly a weak allele of gnom suppressed developmental defects in _PROTEIN_ plants . taken together these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ plays a role in _PROTEIN_ root development by _PROTEIN_ auxin levels and that its function requires _PROTEIN_ activity . these data provide a molecular framework for auxin dependent organ development in arabidopsis .
to gain insight into the functions of _PROTEIN_ we generated transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cdna driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . _PROTEIN_ mrna accumulation was examined in these transgenic plants and the lines and were chosen for use in this study . although the _PROTEIN_ loss of function mutant _PROTEIN_ showed no defect in root system architecture plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ exhibited a short root phenotype and drastically reduced _PROTEIN_ root formation . to understand this phenotype in detail the root development of _PROTEIN_ plants was analyzed . following germination _PROTEIN_ plants showed slow root growth kinetics and their _PROTEIN_ root densities were severely reduced . to test that the phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ plants were dependent on _PROTEIN_ mrna abundance we investigated the root phenotype of a more mildly overexpressed line . _PROTEIN_ mrna levels of and were and fold when compared with the wild type respectively . root developmental phenotypes of were mild when compared with those of . these results suggested the possibility that the more severe defects in _PROTEIN_ root formation observed in _PROTEIN_ seedlings corresponded to _PROTEIN_ mrna accumulation . to determine the stages where _PROTEIN_ root development were disrupted by _PROTEIN_ overexpression the number and the distribution of lrp at stages i to iv and stages v to emerged were determined . although there were no significant differences in the total number of lrp among wild type _PROTEIN_ mutant and seedlings the density of lrp at stages v to emerged was significantly reduced in . in contrast the density of lrp at stages i to iv was significantly increased in roots . therefore our results suggested that _PROTEIN_ overexpression delayed or suppressed lrp development at stages i to iv but that it did not affect _PROTEIN_ root initiation . detailed morphological analysis revealed abnormal cell divisions in the lrps of _PROTEIN_ plants . in contrast to wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants _PROTEIN_ plants exhibited ectopic anticlinal divisions in stage ii primordia and also stage i primordia and disorganized lrp were observed frequently . however these ectopic divisions were not observed at _PROTEIN_ developmental stages including the stage iii and stage iv primordia . this result suggested that _PROTEIN_ root formation was stopped at stages i and ii in abnormally shaped primordia observed in _PROTEIN_ . thus _PROTEIN_ might regulate an early developmental stage of _PROTEIN_ root formation since its overexpression affects this phase specifically . _PROTEIN_ root formation is promoted by auxin but negatively regulated by cytokinin and abscisic acid . ethylene affects _PROTEIN_ root formation in a dose dependent manner . genetic analyses have shown that many _PROTEIN_ root development mutants exhibit altered hormonal responses and vice versa . to investigate whether the hormonal response was altered in _PROTEIN_ plants the effects of various plant hormones on root growth were measured . the synthetic cytokinin benzylaminopurine caused greater inhibition of root growth in _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type irrespective of the concentration used . the inhibitory effects of cytokinin were similar in and . in contrast _PROTEIN_ showed a slightly resistant phenotype for high concentration of bap . sensitivity to aminocyclopropane _PROTEIN_ acid a precursor of ethylene was enhanced in but not in . in contrast responsiveness to the synthetic auxin naphthaleneacetic acid and aba on root growth of _PROTEIN_ plants was unaltered . therefore it was suggested that the overexpression of _PROTEIN_ altered the sensitivity to cytokinin on root growth but not that to auxin ethylene and aba . to analyze the relationship among _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ root formation and cytokinin we monitored _PROTEIN_ root densities of wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings with or without bap . _PROTEIN_ root formation was inhibited by cytokinin in wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings and _PROTEIN_ was more insensitive to cytokinin on _PROTEIN_ root formation than the wild type . in contrast _PROTEIN_ root formation of two _PROTEIN_ lines was significantly inhibited when compared with that of the wild type in the presence of bap . these results indicated that _PROTEIN_ regulates cytokinin dependent _PROTEIN_ root formation . since _PROTEIN_ was originally identified as a regulator of root hydrotropism we investigated whether _PROTEIN_ also regulates _PROTEIN_ root formation under osmotic stress conditions . in the presence of mm mannitol _PROTEIN_ root densities of the wild type and were reduced . in contrast _PROTEIN_ showed a slight osmotic stress tolerant phenotype on _PROTEIN_ root formation . these results suggested that _PROTEIN_ also regulates the root system under the stressed conditions . to analyze the _METHOD_ underlying _PROTEIN_ dependent _PROTEIN_ root development _PROTEIN_ localization patterns were analyzed using _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ . transgenic _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ wild type _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein under the control of the native _PROTEIN_ promoter exhibited a normal hydrotropic response . this finding suggests that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein is a functional equivalent for _PROTEIN_ . in the mature region of primary roots _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in all cell layers . citation demonstrated that the promoter activity of _PROTEIN_ was detected in root tips and in the root mature zone . at this point the reasons for these differences are not clear . however our generated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line could complement _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization patterns were consistent with the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ patterns predicted from root digital in situ analysis based on microarray studies . furthermore we observed four individual lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and all of them showed equivalent _METHOD_ localization patterns . for these reasons we concluded that the generated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein could be used to visualize the localization patterns of native _PROTEIN_ in root tissues . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was not _PROTEIN_ in founder cells or lrp of stages ii to iv . since _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was not detected in founder cells changes in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization pattern occurred at _PROTEIN_ root initiation . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was observed in primordia from stage v onward where it was _PROTEIN_ in the boundary region between the lrp and pericycle cells . since _PROTEIN_ overexpression inhibited _PROTEIN_ root development lrp development might be activated by a reduction in _PROTEIN_ at the pericycle . generally _PROTEIN_ root spacing is tightly regulated thus _PROTEIN_ roots are positioned in a right to left pattern . however the occasional arrest of lrp development leads to mispositioning of _PROTEIN_ roots . to investigate _PROTEIN_ dependent inhibition of lrp development and arrest we analyzed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization in lrp with retarded development of _PROTEIN_ roots . although _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization was not observed during stages i to iv of normal lrp _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was detected in lrp arrested at an early stage . since _PROTEIN_ overexpression modulated the cytokinin response the effects of plant hormones on _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization patterns in lrp were examined . as shown in figure cytokinin treatment dramatically induced the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal at stage ii of lrp development . this observation was consistent with the prediction that excess _PROTEIN_ could inhibit _PROTEIN_ root development via cytokinin activity . in contrast _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization was not affected by treatment with auxin or acc . because auxin plays an essential role in _PROTEIN_ root development and cytokinin acts antagonistically to auxin in this process we tested the effect of auxin on the _PROTEIN_ root formation of _PROTEIN_ roots . in the presence of various concentrations of naa _PROTEIN_ root formation of _PROTEIN_ was clearly recovered by naa in a dose dependent manner . it is well known that elevated ethylene levels enhance auxin biosynthesis in roots . to determine whether ethylene stimulated auxin biosynthesis could rescue _PROTEIN_ root formation in _PROTEIN_ seedlings the plants were grown in the presence of acc _PROTEIN_ root formation was not recovered by acc treatment . since _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants showed similar responses to acc on root growth it is unlikely that _PROTEIN_ dependent _PROTEIN_ root development is related to ethylene mediated alterations in auxin biosynthesis . previous work reported that exogenous auxin rescues _PROTEIN_ root development in auxin synthesis mutants . therefore it is possible that endogenous auxin levels are reduced in the roots of _PROTEIN_ plants to test this hypothesis free indole acetic acid levels were measured . the free iaa levels in _PROTEIN_ roots were significantly lower than in the wild type . to confirm these results activity of the auxin response reporter _METHOD_ was observed . the _METHOD_ signal was significantly weaker in both root tips and lrp of than the wild type . in contrast maxima of _METHOD_ were correctly established in . these data support the observation that _PROTEIN_ overexpression reduces iaa accumulation in arabidopsis . furthermore these results also show that the roots of _PROTEIN_ plants exhibit a slight but significant elevation in the level of free iaa in comparison with the wild type . thus it appears that _PROTEIN_ functions as a negative regulator of auxin accumulation in plants . as _PROTEIN_ overexpression impairs auxin accumulation it is possible that _PROTEIN_ auxin transport is also defective in _PROTEIN_ plants . _PROTEIN_ auxin transport is regulated by the activities of _PROTEIN_ auxin efflux carriers and defects in the regulation or structure of _PROTEIN_ proteins can lead to the disruption of _PROTEIN_ root formation . recent studies show that _PROTEIN_ genes are regulated at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ overexpression influences the regulation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ quantitative analyses of _PROTEIN_ gene transcript levels were performed . _PROTEIN_ overexpression or loss of function did not appear to alter the abundance of any of the _PROTEIN_ mrnas analyzed . in wild type roots _PROTEIN_ localized to the outer periclinal cell side of the lrp and _PROTEIN_ localized to the apical sides of epidermal cells and the basal sides of cortical cells in the meristematic region . similar _PROTEIN_ localization patterns of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were observed in the roots of _PROTEIN_ plants . these data suggested that _PROTEIN_ overexpression does not affect _PROTEIN_ mediated auxin transport activity . vesicle trafficking is also important for _PROTEIN_ root development and _PROTEIN_ an arf gef plays an important role in the formation of these structures . _PROTEIN_ regulates _PROTEIN_ root formation by modulating _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ targeting and recently we isolated a weak gnom allele which lacks a hydrotropic response but shows unaltered root formation and _PROTEIN_ localization . thus represents an interesting tool for investigating _PROTEIN_ functions other than the regulation of _PROTEIN_ trafficking . in the mutant no significant differences in root length or _PROTEIN_ root number were observed . surprisingly normal root development was also observed in a mutant overexpressing _PROTEIN_ . reverse transcription pcr analysis showed that the mutation did not affect _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . observation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in indicated that localization patterns of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in lrp and its cytokinin dependent induction were not altered by mutation . because _PROTEIN_ regulates intercellular vesicle trafficking we compared the intercellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the wild type with that in . as a result no significant difference in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization was detected in the mutant . then we determined endogenous auxin levels in plants since _PROTEIN_ auxin levels lead to the inhibition of _PROTEIN_ root development in _PROTEIN_ plants . as a result significant differences in free iaa levels were not observed among the wild type and . this result clearly demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ function is required for _PROTEIN_ dependent auxin control . phenotypic suppression of the defect in _PROTEIN_ root development in _PROTEIN_ plants may have been caused by a reduction in gef activity which is required for the trafficking of _PROTEIN_ proteins . to examine this hypothesis _PROTEIN_ plants were treated with brefeldin a an inhibitor of gef activity of arf gef . however this defect was not rescued by bfa treatment which suggests that the mutation does not affect gef activity . _PROTEIN_ function is required for basal _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ proteins and when seedlings are grown on bfa containing medium _PROTEIN_ localizes at the apical side of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in cortical cells . in contrast _PROTEIN_ localization was unaltered in the mutant . previously we demonstrated the similar _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ localization in the wild type and the mutant . thus these results support the idea that is not defective in gef activity . next the effects of _PROTEIN_ overexpression on vesicle trafficking were examined in root cells however no significant differences were observed in the internalization of the endocytotic tracer compared with the wild type . moreover bfa treatment induced an aggregation of fm labeled endosomes in both the wild type and and no differences were detected in the localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which are markers of recycling and _PROTEIN_ endosomes respectively . thus overexpression of _PROTEIN_ does not interfere directly with endocytotic or endosomal vesicle trafficking activity . taken together these observations demonstrated that in addition to trafficking _PROTEIN_ proteins _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ novel functions in root development mediated by _PROTEIN_ dependent auxin accumulation .
