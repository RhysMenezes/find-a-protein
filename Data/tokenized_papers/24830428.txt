plant male gametogenesis involves complex and dynamic changes in gene _PROTEIN_ . at present little is known about the transcription _PROTEIN_ involved in this process and how their activities are regulated . here we show that a pollen specific transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and its close homolog _PROTEIN_ are required for male gametogenesis in arabidopsis thaliana . when overexpressed using a strong pollen specific promoter epitope tagged _PROTEIN_ is temporally phosphorylated by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ two mitogen activated protein kinases _PROTEIN_ at early stages in pollen development . during pollen maturation _PROTEIN_ is dephosphorylated and degraded . native promoter driven _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion also follows the same _PROTEIN_ pattern at the protein level . _PROTEIN_ functions redundantly with _PROTEIN_ in pollen development germination and pollen tube growth . loss of _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation sites in _PROTEIN_ compromises the function of _PROTEIN_ in vivo . epistasis interaction analysis confirmed that _PROTEIN_ belongs to the same genetic pathway of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . our study demonstrates the importance of temporal post translational regulation of wrky transcription _PROTEIN_ in the control of developmental phase transitions in plants .
after the identification of _PROTEIN_ as a substrate of _PROTEIN_ in regulating plant defense responses we examined other wrkys that share high homology with _PROTEIN_ for potential mapk phosphorylation sites . wrky transcription _PROTEIN_ are divided into three groups based on the number of wrky domains and the structure of their zinc fingers _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ with two wrky domains belongs to group i in the wrky family . _PROTEIN_ another group i member that shares high homoxlogy with _PROTEIN_ is a pollen specific gene that is preferentially _PROTEIN_ during early stages of male gametogenesis . _PROTEIN_ also contains several consensus mapk phosphorylation sites at similar positions as _PROTEIN_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ might be a _PROTEIN_ substrate as well . putative mapk phosphorylation sites in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . bars indicate the position of potential mapk phosphorylation sites in the protein . grey boxes indicate wrky domains . note that the clusters of phosphorylation sites at n termini were similar between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in vitro phosphorylation assay of _PROTEIN_ by the activated _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . reactions with various components omitted were used as controls . recombinant _PROTEIN_ were used to activate _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . myelin basic protein was used as control substrate . adjacent sequences of putative mapk phosphorylation sites in _PROTEIN_ and the loss of phosphorylation _PROTEIN_ mutant with all ser mutated to ala _PROTEIN_ . mutation of mapk phosphorylation sites greatly reduced the phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ was visualized by autoradiography after gel electrophoresis . to determine if _PROTEIN_ can be phosphorylated by mapks in vitro we prepared a his tagged recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein for in vitro mapk phosphorylation assays . _PROTEIN_ can be strongly phosphorylated by activated _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . without activation by the constitutively active _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ weakly phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ whereas _PROTEIN_ showed no activity demonstrating that the activation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was important for a high level phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ . control reactions with myelin basic protein as an artificial substrate confirmed _PROTEIN_ activation . there are six putative mapk phosphorylation sites within the _PROTEIN_ protein . we performed site directed mutagenesis to change these sites from ser to ala _PROTEIN_ . as shown in the phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ protein by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was greatly reduced demonstrating that these sp motifs are the major _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation sites in _PROTEIN_ . the residual phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ also indicates the existence of other unidentified minor mapk phosphorylation site in _PROTEIN_ . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ is phosphorylated by _PROTEIN_ in vivo we developed an immunoblot protocol to detect _PROTEIN_ protein during male gametogenesis . a four copy myc tag was fused to the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ protein and a pollen specific promoter was used to drive the transgene so that the tagged _PROTEIN_ protein could be _PROTEIN_ specifically and highly in pollen . flowers or buds at various stages were collected for immunoblot detection of _PROTEIN_ protein in pollen . in this assay the open flower right after anthesis was designated . the flower at stage in which anthesis was about to occur was designated as . buds/flowers at earlier stages were named with negative numbers and so on according to their relative positions to the number flower . under our experimental conditions as few as flowers/buds were sufficient for protein extraction and the detection of _PROTEIN_ protein by immunoblot analysis . the stage of pollen development was determined by dapi staining of pollen grains from dissected flowers/buds of multiple plants . the and flowers contained mature pollen _PROTEIN_ grains . the and buds contained homogenous tricellular pollen . the to buds contained a mixture of tcp and bicellular pollen indicating non uniform development of pollen in these bud stages . the and buds contained solely bcp . staging of flowers/buds used for _PROTEIN_ protein analysis . flower at stage in which anthesis is about to occur was designated . an open flower right after anthesis was designated . younger flowers/buds were designated using negative numbers . immunoblot and phos tag assays of promoter driven pollen specific _PROTEIN_ protein at different stages of pollen development . the to flowers/buds have pollen at different developmental stages . black bar indicates flowers or buds containing mature pollen . dark gray bar indicates buds containing tricellular pollen . light gray bar indicates buds containing bicellular pollen . levels of _PROTEIN_ protein in immunoblot and phos tag assay were determined using an anti myc antibody . protein loading control was confirmed by _METHOD_ blue staining . immunoblot and phos tag assay of pollen specific _PROTEIN_ protein at different developmental stages . protein loading control was confirmed by _METHOD_ blue staining . each sample was extracted from the same number of flowers/buds at the corresponding stage which allows the comparison of _PROTEIN_ protein levels in an equal number of developing/mature pollen grains . we found that tagged _PROTEIN_ protein was first detectable in buds which contain bcp . the absence of _PROTEIN_ protein in earlier stages is likely a result of low promoter activity . the _PROTEIN_ signal was stronger in more developed buds and reached its peak in and buds with tcp . interestingly although driven by a promoter with the strongest activity in mature pollen the _PROTEIN_ protein signal was hardly detectable in buds and open flowers . the transcripts from _PROTEIN_ transgene showed a similar _PROTEIN_ pattern as indicated by rt pcr . we also tried an immunoblot assay using flowers from _PROTEIN_ promoter driven _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ . however _PROTEIN_ protein was not detectable in such samples which is likely due to low _PROTEIN_ promoter activity . interestingly as described _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion showed a similar _PROTEIN_ pattern as _PROTEIN_ . therefore we conclude that the use of promoter in this assay could represent at least partially the native _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and modification pattern . in the immunoblot assay we noticed that _PROTEIN_ showed differential migrations in the _PROTEIN_ polyacrylamide gel depending on the developmental stage of the flower buds . in buds with bcp _PROTEIN_ protein exhibited a slightly slower migration . in to buds with a mixture of bcp and tcp _PROTEIN_ existed as doublets and the faster moving band gradually accumulated . in and buds with tcp _PROTEIN_ protein predominately existed as the faster migrating band . these results indicated that _PROTEIN_ protein was modified in bcp possibly by protein phosphorylation and the modification is dependent on the pollen 's developmental stage . to determine whether the slower migrating band of _PROTEIN_ is due to phosphorylation we performed a phos tag mobility shift assay . in this assay the phos tag reagent binds specifically to phosphorylated proteins and slows down their migration in the _PROTEIN_ polyacrylamide gel . as shown in _PROTEIN_ protein was indeed phosphorylated in the bcp of buds and was gradually dephosphorylated in _PROTEIN_ stages of the male gametogenesis . the phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ was greatly reduced upon pollen maturation at which is followed by complete disappearance of _PROTEIN_ protein in flowers . we then performed immunoblot with _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants to determine if the shifting of protein bands is dependent on the mapk phosphorylation sites in _PROTEIN_ . although the protein _PROTEIN_ pattern is similar to _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ protein showed no band shift in either the immunoblot or phos tag assay . this result further confirmed that _PROTEIN_ was temporally phosphorylated during early pollen development and the phosphorylation occurred on the _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation sites delineated in the in vitro phosphorylation assay . to demonstrate that the in vivo phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ during pollen development is carried out by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we introduced the _PROTEIN_ transgene into the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant background . since the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant is embryo lethal we attempted pollen specific rnai suppression of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background . promoter driven _PROTEIN_ construct was transformed into the _PROTEIN_ plants . because of the pollen specific _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ the sporophytic tissues were not affected which allowed us to obtain the double homozygous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants . real time qpcr demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in pollen from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants was knocked down . we then performed immunoblot and phos tag assays of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants . the mobility shift of _PROTEIN_ was abolished in the absence of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . this loss of function system demonstrated that the _PROTEIN_ was phosphorylated specifically by _PROTEIN_ and/or _PROTEIN_ . the stability of _PROTEIN_ protein apparently was not affected by the mapk phosphorylation since mutation of the ser residues that are phosphorylated by _PROTEIN_ did not affect the protein _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ during pollen development . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen grains . total rnas were isolated from pollen grains . _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were determined using quantitative rt pcr . _LOCATION_ bars standard derivation . immunoblot and phos tag assays of _PROTEIN_ protein at different stages of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ flower buds . protein loading control was confirmed by _METHOD_ blue staining . each sample was extracted from the same number of flowers/buds at the corresponding stage which allows the comparison of _PROTEIN_ protein levels in an equal number of developing/mature pollen grains . previous studies showed that _PROTEIN_ is an early pollen gene enriched in unm and bcp and that mutation of the _PROTEIN_ gene increases the pollen 's tolerance to cold stress . however the biological function of _PROTEIN_ in pollen development remains unclear . under our growth conditions single _PROTEIN_ mutant pollen showed no developmental defect . since more than of the wrky family members are _PROTEIN_ in the male gametophytes we speculated that there might be functionally redundant wrky member in early pollen development . a phylogenetic analysis was used to identify such member . _PROTEIN_ is closely related to _PROTEIN_ a wrky member _PROTEIN_ in various tissues including male gametophyte . we examined by quantitative rt pcr the _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in several tissues . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was very low in most examined tissues and was slightly higher in floral buds . in contrast _PROTEIN_ showed higher _PROTEIN_ in all detected tissues . to examine the detailed _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in pollen at different stages we fused the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genomic sequences which contain promoter and gene coding region with _METHOD_ . the _METHOD_ signal of both fusion proteins was detectable in _LOCATION_ which was consistent with their function as transcription _PROTEIN_ . it is also noteworthy that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals were detectable in the vegetative cell but not in the generative or sperm cells . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was absent in _METHOD_ while it became significantly higher in bcp _LOCATION_ . the _METHOD_ signal in _LOCATION_ was also found in tcp and _PROTEIN_ . for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ signal was dim in unm although it was still distinguishable from the pollen auto _METHOD_ . the signal was more detectable in bcp and tcp . however in contrast to _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was absent in _PROTEIN_ . these results showed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ overlaps at the bcp and tcp stages . in addition the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ pattern was similar to the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the immunoblot assay . this further indicated that the _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ pattern was not solely dependent on promoter activity .

to be a null mutant . we performed quantitative rt pcr to examine _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ pollen . the result showed that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was moderately knocked down in seedlings of both alleles . however in pollen _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was almost completely knocked out in _PROTEIN_ but not in _PROTEIN_ . therefore we crossed _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ to generate the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant and then examined the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant pollen function by reciprocal crosses using combinations of heterozygous mutants and wild type .

plants of indicated genotype . the genotypes of progenies were determined by pcr genotyping which was used to determine the transmission of pollen of different genotypes . bold numbers indicate significant aberrant transmission ratios from the expected ratio of . the male transmission of the mutant alleles was normal when pollen grains from either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ plants were used as pollen donors suggesting that single mutations of either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ had no effect on the function of pollen . however when using _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants as the male parents we observed that the transmission of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen was significantly reduced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . this result suggested that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are important for pollen function but also that a portion of the double mutant pollen grains remained functional . the transmission of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ female gametophytes was normal indicating that the female gametophyte function was not affected . because of the leaky transmission of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen we were able to obtain _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ homozygous double mutant plants at low frequency . morphologically the double mutant plant was indistinguishable from the wild type . to examine the development of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen we used alexander 's staining to distinguish normal and aborted pollen . in this assay the cytoplasm of normal pollen should show a purple color and the pollen wall a distinctive green color . pollen grains from wild type plants were viewed as full round purple stained grains . in contrast a portion of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen exhibited aberrant morphology and green color which indicated impaired pollen development of the double mutant . we then performed fluorescein diacetate _PROTEIN_ staining to check the viability of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen . in comparison with wild type pollen grains the majority of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen failed to show _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and therefore was likely to be dead . the non viable rate in _PROTEIN_ staining was higher than that in the alexander staining indicating that _PROTEIN_ is a more sensitive viability assay . there were _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen grains with a small patch that failed to be stained using alexander staining . they were classified as viable pollen but might be non viable . in contrast _PROTEIN_ staining which is dependent on both cellular esterase activity and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ integrity gave much clearer results . for this reason _PROTEIN_ staining was used for all the other experiments . we next stained the developing pollen at earlier stages with _PROTEIN_ . the lethality of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen was first identifiable in buds with bcp and the percentage of lethal pollen increased following pollen development . the onset of pollen death in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant correlates with the appearance of _PROTEIN_ protein in bcp and tcp stages suggesting the requirement of these two wrkys at these developmental stages . there are two possible reasons for the lower percentages of _PROTEIN_ positive pollen at early developmental stages and then the gradual increase in _PROTEIN_ positive pollen in the wild type . firstly the tapetal cell layer surrounding the developing pollen could reduce the efficiency of _PROTEIN_ staining at the early stage . secondly dissection and squeezing to release pollen from the anther and tapetum might damage the immature pollen . side by side comparison revealed that the _PROTEIN_ positive pollen from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants continued to drop indicating the loss of viability of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant pollen . we also examined the ultrastructure of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen using scanning electron microscopy _PROTEIN_ . both wild type and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen appeared to have normal pollen wall structures . in contrast to the uniformly shaped wild type pollen grains the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen grains were a mixture of shapes including normal shaped pollen collapsed pollen and ruptured pollen remnant . this indicated that the development of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen was defective . further analysis with transmission electron microscopy confirmed the abnormal ultrastructure of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen . consistent with the cytological staining results a portion of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen was collapsed with leaky cytoplasm content . furthermore for the majority of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen that exhibited similar exterior appearance as wild type pollen the intracellular ultrastructure was different from that of the wild type pollen . the numbers of _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were reduced in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen grain . in addition the intine layer was discontinuous and undulated at the germination pore of the double mutant pollen grain . in addition to a pollen developmental defect the in vitro germination assay revealed that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant was defective in pollen function . in our assays the average germination ratio of wild type pollen was while only of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen was capable of germination under the same conditions . the reduction in pollen germination appears to be a result of reduced pollen viability . for the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen that germinated the pollen tube length was significantly shorter than the length of wild type pollen tubes . the average pollen tube length was in the wild type and in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant at hours after germination in vitro representing a reduction in length in the double mutant pollen tubes . pollination analysis followed by aniline blue staining further demonstrated that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant was defective in pollen germination and pollen tube growth in vivo . since _PROTEIN_ protein was degraded before pollen maturation we speculated that the reduced germination and tube growth of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen were not an indication of a requirement of _PROTEIN_ in these two processes but rather a result of weak pollen due to impaired development which was also evident based on the tem observation . in vitro pollen germination of wild type and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant pollen . bars . aniline blue staining of wild type pistils hours after pollination

_PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants . _LOCATION_ bar standard _LOCATION_ . double asterisks indicate statistically very significant difference from wild type pollen . to test whether phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ is important for its function in pollen development we performed genetic complementation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen using _PROTEIN_ promoter driven _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . pollen from homozygous progenies with a transgene _PROTEIN_ level similar to wild type was selected and examined . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen showed viability germination and pollen tube growth similar to wild type pollen indicating that the _PROTEIN_ transgene can complement the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen phenotype . in contrast the function of _PROTEIN_ transgene was significantly compromised . the viability ratio of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen was partially rescued to from of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen which was significantly lower than wild type and _PROTEIN_ complemented pollen . the double mutant pollen germination rate was only slightly rescued by _PROTEIN_ while it was fully complemented by _PROTEIN_ which was similar to wild type pollen . furthermore the average pollen tube length of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen was about the same as the double mutant and much shorter than the wild type and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen . these results indicated that although the pollen lethality of the double mutant was partially rescued by _PROTEIN_ the pollen function was still abnormal . as a result we conclude that the phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ is important for the function of _PROTEIN_ protein in vivo . although the native promoter driven _PROTEIN_ transgene _PROTEIN_ could fully complement the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant immunoblot analysis failed to detect the tagged _PROTEIN_ protein in the inflorescences or floral buds in these rescued lines which is most likely a result of the low _PROTEIN_ level of the native promoter . to exclude the possibility that mutation of multiple ser to ala in _PROTEIN_ altered its general functionality such that the _PROTEIN_ can not bind or has reduced dna binding activity we compared the w box binding activity of the recombinant _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ using electrophoretic mobility shift assay _METHOD_ . as shown in there was no difference in the w box binding activity and specificity of _PROTEIN_ after the ser to ala mutation suggesting that the reduced functionality of _PROTEIN_ is not a result of a general loss of _PROTEIN_ function . based on these results the phosphorylation by _PROTEIN_ is important for the function of _PROTEIN_ in pollen development and function . due to the embryo lethality of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double zygotes we can not analyze the phenotype of pollen grains from the double homozygous plants . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant pollen from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants although it exhibited altered transmission did not show any developmental defects like _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen . we speculate that in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen the unphosphorylated _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ each retained basal level function which kept the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen above the threshold of visible developmental defects . this is consistent with the finding that _PROTEIN_ mutant protein can partially complement the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant pollen . alternatively _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ protein carried over from the microspore mother cells of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants which have at least one good copy of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ could be sufficient to support the development of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen . it is known that mapks are very stable proteins in cells . although both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are involved in pollen function _PROTEIN_ apparently is more important as indicated by its much higher _PROTEIN_ in pollen . therefore we speculate that the double mutation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in which the pollen produced a single wrky protein with reduced phosphorylation might result in a weak phenotype in pollen development . as shown in both _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen showed developmental and functional defects that were similar to the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant pollen . the pollen viability was in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ respectively which indicated moderate pollen lethality in the double mutants . in accordance the pollen germination rate was also _PROTEIN_ slightly from an average of of wild type pollen to of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . furthermore the average pollen tube lengths of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was significantly reduced to and respectively in comparison with the of wild type pollen tubes . this result indicated that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen function was affected and confirmed that _PROTEIN_ belongs to the same genetic pathway as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . pollen viability ratio by _PROTEIN_ staining in vitro pollen

arabidopsis thaliana columbia ecotype was used as the wild type . t dna insertion alleles of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center _PROTEIN_ . seeds were surface sterilized and imbibed at for days then plated on half strength murashige and skoog medium with phytagar . plates were incubated in a tissue culture chamber at under continuous light for days . seedlings were then transplanted to soil and grown in the greenhouse with a h h dark cycle . in pcr based genotyping the presence of the t dna and wild type alleles was detected using _PROTEIN_ and two gene specific primers _PROTEIN_ lp and _PROTEIN_ rp for the _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ lp _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ rp for the _PROTEIN_ mutant . to generate the binary vector with the promoter overexpression cassette a modified version of was digested with hindiii and xhoi to replace the camv promoter with the promoter . to generate the driven _PROTEIN_ overexpression construct _PROTEIN_ we amplified the _PROTEIN_ cdna by using primers _PROTEIN_ f and _PROTEIN_ b . the pcr fragment was cloned into a modified pbluescript ii _PROTEIN_ vector with a four copy myc epitope tag coding sequence at the end to generate pbs _PROTEIN_ construct . the _PROTEIN_ fragment was then cloned into the pbi vector using spei and xhoi sites . to generate _PROTEIN_ cdna mutations were introduced into the pbs _PROTEIN_ construct by quick change site directed mutagenesis . primers used were as following with mutated residues in lower case _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and their reverse complementary primers . _PROTEIN_ with all six ser residues mutated to ala residues was generated by five successive mutagenesis steps and verified by sequencing . to generate the _PROTEIN_ construct the _PROTEIN_ fragment was cloned into the pbi vector using spei and xhoi sites . to generate the pollen specific _PROTEIN_ construct the _PROTEIN_ sequence as described previously was cloned into the pbi vector between the spei and xhoi sites . the construct was introduced into the _PROTEIN_ mutant and homozygous transgenic plants were identified as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to generate the _PROTEIN_ overexpression construct with a _PROTEIN_ selection marker for transformation of a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plant the _PROTEIN_ cassette was amplified and partially digested with apai and bamhi and then cloned into the pgreenii vector . to generate _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs genomic fragments of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were amplified . pcr products and pgreenii _METHOD_ plasmid were digested by xhoi and ecorv and ligation was performed . all the binary vectors described below were transformed into agrobacterium strain . arabidopsis transformation was performed by the floral dip procedure and transformants were identified by screening for kanamycin or _PROTEIN_ resistance . _METHOD_ microscopy was performed with an olympus inverted microscope with an orca digital camera . pollen viability was examined using alexander staining . pictures were taken on an olympus vanox upright microscope with a color digital camera . the _PROTEIN_ staining assay was performed as described . dapi was used to stain vegetative and generative/sperm _LOCATION_ to determine the pollen development . for _PROTEIN_ or dapi staining of developing pollen floral buds at each stage were carefully dissected under stereoscope . anthers were isolated and transferred to a drop of _PROTEIN_ or dapi solution . a fine needle was used to gently break the anthers a cover slip was then used to carefully squeeze the anthers to release the pollen . for _PROTEIN_ fresh pollen grains were coated directly with platinum and observed on an fei quanta feg extended vacuum scanning electron microscope . pollen germination assays were performed as described . for pollen tube length measurements at hour after germination at least pollen tubes in each sample were determined using imagej software . the presented data are an average of biological repeats . for purification of recombinant _PROTEIN_ and its mutant proteins the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cdnas were cut from the pbs _PROTEIN_ constructs with ndei/spei and ligated into the ndei/nhei cut vector in frame . the constructs were transformed into e. coli strain . the in vitro phosphorylation assay was performed as previously described . protein extraction was performed as previously described with modification . open flowers or closed buds at similar stages were collected from inflorescences . the flowers/buds were ground in liquid nitrogen and extracted in _PROTEIN_ loading buffer . a sample was loaded to each lane . the numbers of developing/mature pollen grains should be similar among each sample . however due to the size difference of the flowers/buds at different developmental stages different amounts of total proteins were present which is reflected by the different amount of rubisco large subunit protein in the _METHOD_ blue stained control gels . in this experiment a comparison of _PROTEIN_ protein levels in an equal number of developing/mature pollen grains is better than in an equal amount of total proteins . a phos tag reagent was used for the phospho protein mobility shift assay to detect in vivo phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ protein as previously described . the multiple sequence alignment of full length protein sequences was performed using the clustalw tool online . phylogenetic trees were constructed and tested by based on the neighbor joining method . total rna was extracted from each tissue using rnaqueous according to the manufacturer 's instructions . after dnase treatment of total rna was reverse transcribed and quantitative pcr analysis was performed using an optican real time pcr machine . relative levels of each transcript were calculated after being normalized to the _PROTEIN_ or control . _METHOD_ was performed as previously described . a synthetic dna oligonucleotide was used as a probe . two complementary strands of the oligonucleotides were annealed and then labeled at the end using a polynucleotide kinase . freshly prepared recombinant _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ protein was incubated with cpm of dna probe for min at room temperature in a binding buffer in the presence or absence of an unlabeled competitor dna . the resulting protein dna complexes were resolved in non denaturing polyacrylamide gel in half strength tbe buffer . following electrophoresis the gel was dried onto mm paper and exposed to x ray film .
