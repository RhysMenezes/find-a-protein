in eukaryotic cells protein trafficking plays an essential role in biogenesis of proteins that belong to the endomembrane compartments . in this process an important step is the sorting of organellar proteins depending on their final destinations . for _LOCATION_ proteins _LOCATION_ sorting receptors and receptor homology transmembrane _PROTEIN_ domain proteins are thought to be responsible . arabidopsis contains seven vsrs . among them _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are involved in sorting storage proteins targeted to the protein storage _LOCATION_ in seeds . however the identity of vsrs for soluble proteins of the lytic _LOCATION_ in vegetative cells remains controversial . here we provide evidence that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are involved in sorting soluble lytic _LOCATION_ and psv proteins in vegetative cells . in protoplasts from leaf tissues of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and double mutants soluble lytic _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins but not the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein arabidopsis _METHOD_ exhibited defects in their trafficking they accumulated to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ with an increased secretion into medium . the trafficking defects in _PROTEIN_ protoplasts were rescued by _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . furthermore of the luminal domain swapping mutants between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the mutant with the luminal domain of _PROTEIN_ but not that of _PROTEIN_ rescued the trafficking defects of arabidopsis aleurain like protein _METHOD_ and phaseolin in _PROTEIN_ protoplasts . based on these results we propose that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but not other vsrs are involved in sorting soluble lytic _LOCATION_ and psv proteins for their trafficking to the _LOCATION_ in vegetative cells .
in previous studies the role of vsrs in _LOCATION_ trafficking was examined by employing an approach of overexpression of wild type or mutant _METHOD_ of vsrs in wild type protoplasts . based on the _PROTEIN_ data in genevestigator arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ in multiple tissues and show relatively high _PROTEIN_ in mesophyll cell protoplast . thus to gain further insight into the role of vsrs in vegetative tissues we used the loss of function mutant of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and examined the trafficking of _LOCATION_ luminal proteins _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in protoplasts from leaf tissues of vsr single mutant plants . a previous study showed that the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants exhibit a defect in protein trafficking to the psv in seed cells . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is a c terminal _METHOD_ fusion of _PROTEIN_ that has both an n terminal ssvss and ctvss . in protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is transported to the central _LOCATION_ where it is processed proteolytically into a smaller form . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is a c terminal _METHOD_ fusion protein of atcpy _PROTEIN_ that has an n terminal _LOCATION_ sorting signal and is targeted to the lumen of the lv . protoplasts from wild type and vsr single mutant plants were transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and protein extracts from transformed protoplasts were analyzed by western blotting using anti _METHOD_ antibody . when the _LOCATION_ trafficking is inhibited _LOCATION_ proteins are secreted into the incubation medium . therefore proteins from protoplast incubation medium were included in the analysis . at h after transformation _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was processed to a smaller form that accumulated to to of total proteins in both columbia and wassilewskija wild type protoplasts . in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant protoplasts although the degree of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ secretion varies depending on these vsr mutants a small proportion of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was secreted into the incubation medium and the amount of the processed form was slightly reduced . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ another luminal _LOCATION_ protein also produced similar results with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the amount of the secreted protein was increased to in these vsr single mutant protoplasts and concomitantly the amount of the processed form was slightly reduced indicating that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants exhibit a minor defect in protein trafficking to the lv . in a previous study both _PROTEIN_ and atcpy were not secreted into the apoplasts in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . one possible explanation for the discrepancy is that both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and atcpy _METHOD_ were _PROTEIN_ at higher levels in protoplasts than in leaf tissues and the reduced capacity of the _LOCATION_ trafficking pathway resulted from the mutation can not handle the higher levels of these proteins for _LOCATION_ trafficking . _PROTEIN_ is involved in sorting of psv proteins . accordingly we examined the trafficking of phaseolin a storage protein of phaseolus vulgaris that contains a ctvss in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant protoplasts . phaseolin was introduced into protoplasts from leaf tissues of wild type and vsr single mutant plants and protein extracts from protoplasts and incubation medium were analyzed by western blotting using antiphaseolin antibody . when phaseolin is targeted to the _LOCATION_ in tobacco leaf tissues or arabidopsis protoplasts derived from leaf tissues it is processed proteolytically into multiple smaller protein species . as reported previously approximately of total _PROTEIN_ phaseolin was processed into smaller protein species in wild type protoplasts . in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant protoplasts the amount of processed form was slightly reduced and a small proportion of phaseolin was secreted into the incubation medium indicating that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants have a minor defect in trafficking of phaseolin in leaf cells . these results are consistent with the notion that other members of the vsr family may participate in the trafficking of soluble cargo in vegetative tissues . to confirm these results at the cellular level we examined localization of these cargo proteins in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or phaseolin were transformed into wild type _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ protoplasts and localization of these cargo proteins was examined directly or by immunohistochemistry using antiphaseolin antibody . similar to the wild type protoplasts the majority of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant protoplasts transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ produced _LOCATION_ patterns . in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant protoplasts phaseolin localized primarily to a structure with a diameter of as reported previously . these results confirm that although a certain portion of these cargo proteins is secreted into the medium _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants do not have any substantial effect on the localization pattern . the results shown in figure prompted us to test whether vsrs have a redundant function in vegetative tissues . therefore _LOCATION_ trafficking of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was examined in protoplasts from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ double mutants . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was introduced into wild type or double mutant protoplasts and the _LOCATION_ trafficking of these proteins was examined by western blotting using anti _METHOD_ antibody . the amount of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ secreted into the medium in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ protoplasts was and of total _PROTEIN_ proteins respectively concomitantly the processed form of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to and of total _PROTEIN_ proteins in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ protoplasts respectively . these results indicate that the double mutant had much more severe defects in protein trafficking to the lv . in contrast in _PROTEIN_ mutant protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was not secreted into the medium and the amount of the processed form was comparable with that of wild type protoplasts indicating that _LOCATION_ trafficking of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is not affected in _PROTEIN_ double mutants . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ produced similar results to those of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant protoplasts the amount of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ that was secreted was and of total _PROTEIN_ proteins respectively and the processed _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were reduced to and of total proteins respectively whereas the _PROTEIN_ mutant did not show any defect in _LOCATION_ trafficking of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . furthermore a large proportion of atcpy was secreted into the incubation medium when transiently _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mutant protoplasts but not in wild type protoplasts . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are involved in _LOCATION_ trafficking of ssvss containing proteins in vegetative tissues and they are functionally redundant in protein trafficking to the lvs . we also examined trafficking of phaseolin in these double mutants . phaseolin was introduced into protoplasts from leaf tissues of these double mutant plants and its trafficking was examined by western blot analysis using antiphaseolin antibody . similar to the trafficking patterns observed with ssvss containing _LOCATION_ proteins trafficking of phaseolin was defective in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ mutants . in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant protoplasts and of phaseolin was secreted into the incubation medium respectively whereas in _PROTEIN_ mutant protoplasts trafficking of phaseolin was as efficient as that observed in wild type protoplasts . these results confirm that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are involved in the trafficking of phaseolin . together these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are redundantly involved in trafficking of both lv and psv proteins in leaf cells . as a control we examined whether these vsr mutants have any effect on the secretory pathway . protoplasts from wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants were transformed with invertase _METHOD_ to _PROTEIN_ a chimeric protein of secretory invertase and _METHOD_ and its trafficking was examined by western blot analysis . figure shows that invertase _METHOD_ was efficiently secreted in vsr double mutants including _PROTEIN_ confirming that these vsrs are specific to trafficking of proteins to the lv and psv . to obtain independent evidence for the role of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was examined in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _LOCATION_ localized chaperone binding protein monomeric red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ were introduced into _PROTEIN_ mutant protoplasts and localization of these proteins was examined under a _METHOD_ microscope . in _PROTEIN_ mutant protoplasts the majority of protoplasts produced the _LOCATION_ pattern and also network pattern which colocalized with an _LOCATION_ marker protein bip _METHOD_ indicating that trafficking of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is inhibited and some proportion of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localizes to the _LOCATION_ . next we examined the localization of phaseolin in _PROTEIN_ double mutant plants . _PROTEIN_ double mutant protoplasts were cotransformed with phaseolin and bip _METHOD_ and the localization of phaseolin was examined by immunostaining with antiphaseolin antibody . the majority of transformed protoplasts displayed the network pattern instead of the speckle pattern . the network pattern of phaseolin overlapped with that of bip _METHOD_ at the _LOCATION_ indicating that phaseolin localizes primarily to the _LOCATION_ . these data confirm that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function redundantly in trafficking of both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and phaseolin to the lv and the subcellular structure that gives the speckle pattern respectively . next we tested whether vsrs are also involved in trafficking of _LOCATION_ proteins destined for the tonoplasts of the lv . we examined trafficking of _METHOD_ a chimeric protein of and _METHOD_ in vsr double mutants . it has been proposed that _METHOD_ is delivered and incorporated into the tonoplast first and then subsequently released into the lumen of the lv by proteolytic processing . as reported previously in wild type protoplasts _METHOD_ was efficiently targeted to the central _LOCATION_ when examined by western blot analysis using anti _METHOD_ antibody . in addition in vsr double mutant protoplasts _METHOD_ was targeted to the lv as efficiently as it was in wild type protoplasts indicating that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are not involved in trafficking of _LOCATION_ proteins to the lv . to confirm this we examined the localization of _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ mutant protoplasts . the majority of transformed _PROTEIN_ mutant protoplasts gave green _METHOD_ signals in the central _LOCATION_ confirming that it is targeted to the lv . these results suggest that vsrs are not involved in the _LOCATION_ trafficking of _LOCATION_ proteins . to further test the role of vsrs in _LOCATION_ trafficking and their functional redundancy we examined whether _PROTEIN_ can complement the defect in _LOCATION_ trafficking of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in protoplasts from _PROTEIN_ double mutant plants . varying amounts of the epitope hemagglutinin tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plasmid were introduced into _PROTEIN_ mutant protoplasts together with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the _LOCATION_ trafficking of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was analyzed by western blotting using anti _METHOD_ antibody . the c terminal ha epitope tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ colocalizes primarily with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ at the pvc indicating that the ha epitope tag at the c terminus does not interfere with its proper localization of vsrs in protoplasts . the amount of secreted _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was gradually _PROTEIN_ with increasing amounts of _PROTEIN_ ha indicating that transiently _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ha rescues the defect in the _LOCATION_ trafficking of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the _PROTEIN_ double mutant background . similarly transiently _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ha reduced the amounts of secreted _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and phaseolin in a dose dependent manner . in a reciprocal experiment we examined whether _PROTEIN_ can complement the _LOCATION_ trafficking defect of _PROTEIN_ double mutant plants . varying amounts of the _PROTEIN_ ha plasmid were introduced into _PROTEIN_ mutant protoplasts together with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or phaseolin and their trafficking efficiency was determined by western blot analysis using anti _METHOD_ or antiphaseolin antibody . at of _PROTEIN_ ha _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was no longer secreted into the medium . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and phaseolin showed similar recovery in their _LOCATION_ trafficking from coexpression of _PROTEIN_ ha confirming that _PROTEIN_ complements the defect in trafficking of _LOCATION_ and psv proteins in _PROTEIN_ double mutant plants . these results strongly suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are functionally redundant in trafficking of both ssvss and ctvss containing cargo proteins in vegetative tissues . among the double mutants _PROTEIN_ protoplasts did not have any noticeable defect in the trafficking of _LOCATION_ and psv proteins . this raised the possibility that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are not involved in the trafficking of these proteins . to test this possibility we examined whether _PROTEIN_ can complement the defect in the trafficking of _LOCATION_ and psv proteins in protoplasts from _PROTEIN_ double mutant plants . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or phaseolin were introduced into _PROTEIN_ protoplasts together with increasing amounts of _PROTEIN_ ha and trafficking of these proteins was determined by western blot analysis . _PROTEIN_ ha did not complement the defect in _PROTEIN_ mutants . in _PROTEIN_ overexpression of _PROTEIN_ ha aggravated the defect in the trafficking of these proteins and caused further secretion into the medium in a dose dependent manner indicating that _PROTEIN_ can not complement the defect in trafficking of these proteins in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . however it is intriguing that high levels of _PROTEIN_ aggravate the trafficking defects in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . one possible explanation is that _PROTEIN_ may compete with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for the molecular machineries for receptor recycling . the sorting receptors recycle back to the tgn via the retromer complex . in arabidopsis a component of the retromer complex interacts with vsr and lack of inhibits the efficient trafficking of storage proteins to the psv . consistent with this notion the amino acid sequence of the c terminal domain of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is highly similar to that of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the luminal proteinase associated _PROTEIN_ domain contains a binding site for the _LOCATION_ targeting signal . the seven atvsrs are divided into two groups based on the sequence homology of the _PROTEIN_ domains one group with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and the other group with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . therefore it is possible that the specificity of vsrs in _LOCATION_ trafficking may be determined by the luminal domain . to test this idea we generated domain swapping mutants between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ by exchanging their luminal domains denoted as ha and ha . these constructs were examined for complementation of the defect in protein trafficking in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . ha or ha were cotransformed into protoplasts from _PROTEIN_ mutants with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _LOCATION_ trafficking of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was examined by western blot analysis using anti _METHOD_ antibody . ha but not ha efficiently complemented the defect in trafficking of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the _PROTEIN_ double mutant protoplasts . similar results were obtained with the psv protein phaseolin . these results strongly suggest that the cargo specificity is determined by the luminal domain of vsrs and the luminal domains of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ encode different cargo specificity from that of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . an alternative possibility is that these two groups of vsrs may localize to different organelles . however previous studies show that all seven vsrs localize to the pvc . to rule out this possibility we examined the localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts . _PROTEIN_ ha was cotransformed into wild type protoplasts together with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and the localization of these proteins was examined by immunostaining using anti ha antibody . _PROTEIN_ ha exhibited a punctate staining pattern that closely overlapped with that of both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . this result further supports the idea that the failure to complement the defect of protein trafficking in the _PROTEIN_ double mutants by _PROTEIN_ likely results from the difference in cargo specificity in the _PROTEIN_ domains between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . previous studies suggested that _PROTEIN_ is a cargo receptor for storage proteins . to gain insight into the role of rmrs in the _LOCATION_ trafficking in vegetative tissues we examined the trafficking of soluble cargoes in protoplasts from _PROTEIN_ and double mutants . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or phaseolin were introduced into wild type or mutant protoplasts and the _LOCATION_ trafficking of these proteins was examined by western blotting using anti _METHOD_ or antiphaseolin antibody . in _PROTEIN_ and mutant protoplasts trafficking of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was as efficient as that observed in wild type protoplasts . these proteins were not secreted into the medium and the amount of the processed form was comparable with that of wild type protoplasts . similar results were obtained with the ctvss containing cargo protein phaseolin . _PROTEIN_ and mutant did not exhibit any defect in the trafficking of phaseolin . thus these results from the rmr mutants did not agree with those of previous studies where overexpression of a dominant negative form of _PROTEIN_ was used . one possible explanation is that seven atrmr _METHOD_ are functionally redundant and mutations in two out of seven may not cause any significant defect in _LOCATION_ trafficking in leaf protoplasts . it has been shown that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interact with ctvss containing peptide . thus it is possible that _PROTEIN_ and vsrs may cooperate in the trafficking of phaseolin . to test this idea we examined whether _PROTEIN_ can complement the _LOCATION_ trafficking defect of the _PROTEIN_ double mutant . _PROTEIN_ ha was introduced into _PROTEIN_ mutant protoplasts with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or phaseolin and the _LOCATION_ trafficking of these proteins was examined by western blotting using anti _METHOD_ or antiphaseolin antibody . as shown in figure d and e _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ ha did not rescue the defects in trafficking of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and phaseolin in the _PROTEIN_ mutant indicating that atrmr does not complement the vsr mutations in _LOCATION_ trafficking . it is possible that atrmrs and atvsrs may play a role at different stages of _LOCATION_ trafficking in leaf cells .
