protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation is a central post translational modification in plant hormone signaling but little is known about its extent and function . although pertinent protein kinases and phosphatases have been predicted and identified for a variety of hormone responses classical biochemical approaches have so far revealed only a few candidate proteins and even fewer phosphorylation sites . here we performed a global quantitative analysis of the arabidopsis phosphoproteome in response to a time course of treatments with various plant hormones using phosphopeptide enrichment and subsequent _METHOD_ accuracy precursor alignment . the use of three time points and h in combination with five phytohormone treatments abscisic acid indole acetic acid gibberellic acid jasmonic acid and kinetin resulted in precursor ions from lc orbitrap _METHOD_ analyses quantified and aligned in a data _PROTEIN_ with the dimension of using the protmax algorithm . to dissect the phytohormone responses multivariate principal/independent components analysis was performed . in total phosphopeptides were identified as differentially regulated these phosphopeptides are involved in a wide variety of signaling pathways . new phosphorylation sites were identified for aba response element binding _PROTEIN_ that showed a specific increase in response to aba . new phosphorylation sites were also found for _PROTEIN_ and auxin transporters . we found that different hormones regulate distinct amino acid residues of members of the same protein families . in contrast tyrosine phosphorylation of the subunit appeared to be a common response for multiple hormones demonstrating global cross talk among hormone signaling pathways .
to accurately determine phosphorylation dynamics related to the effect of hormones three time course treatments of arabidopsis cell suspension were analyzed for three biological replicates . we analysed three time points in combination with five phytohormone treatments abscisic acid indole acetic acid gibberellic acid jasmonic acid and kinetin . the tryptic peptides were subjected to phosphopeptide enrichment and subsequently analyzed using a high _METHOD_ accuracy lc orbitrap _METHOD_ _METHOD_ system . we have recently developed a strategy called _METHOD_ accuracy precursor alignment . this strategy combines high sample throughput and rapid data validation and interpretation with typical properties of shotgun proteomics to detect low abundance alkaline and/or barely soluble proteins such as transcription _PROTEIN_ or _LOCATION_ proteins as well as protein modifications such as peptide phosphorylation . using mapa and the corresponding algorithm protmax precursor ions in lc orbitrap _METHOD_ analyses were quantified and aligned resulting in a data _PROTEIN_ dimension of . the whole strategy is described in detail in figure . subsequent multivariate statistical analysis of this data _PROTEIN_ enabled the comparison of common and distinct phosphoprotein responses dependent on the respective phytohormone treatment . figure shows an independent components analysis of the quantitative proteomic phenotypes of the arabidopsis cell cultures treated with the five phytohormones and an untreated control at each time point . treatments and measurements were performed three times independently the effects of the hormones could be reproducibly determined i.e . the proteomic phenotypes of biological replicates were in close proximity . the effects of the treatments _METHOD_ were clearly separated in a time dependent manner with the changes becoming more pronounced over time and maximal at h. proteomics phenotypes after treatment are shown for each phytohormone individually . sample patterns from the ica show each hormone separated from the control as well as changes appearing over time indicating that hormone specific effects and developmental processes can be separated from one another . the aba treated samples were separate from the control on and ja ga and kinetin treated samples were separate from the control on . the third and fourth components identify temporal changes in control and aba ga and kinetin treated samples respectively . similarly the first and second components depict the time course for control iaa and ja treated samples . the ica revealed that different hormones elicit distinct responses in arabidopsis cell cultures . the loadings of the ica that correspond to the phosphorylated peptides allow ranked assignment of protein sets to the observed pattern and are directly related to the importance of the proteins in the biological phenomena . to identify protein phosphorylation changes in response to various hormones the cid spectra corresponding to the top loadings of the ica were subjected to a database search . only precursor ions that were identified in all three biological replicates were considered . our phosphoproteome analysis identified over peptides which were ultimately assigned to around unique peptide sequences . of a total of proteins corresponding to phosphopeptides identified as differentially phosphorylated proteins were identified by more than two unique peptides and proteins were supported by a single peptide identification . furthermore we found that over of the responsive phosphoproteins are from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and < are _LOCATION_ proteins indicating that most of them are primary responsive proteins . by quantitative analysis the spectral count showed that < represent contamination from endomembranes in agreement with experimentally determined contamination of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ preparations using stable isotope labeling . all _METHOD_ spectra and metadata for the identified proteins are stored in the public _METHOD_ spectral reference database promex and can be further used for _METHOD_ spectral match and peptide identification in new samples . to understand the biological processes and cellular components involved in hormone responses in arabidopsis cells gene ontology analyses were performed for the responsive phosphoproteins including both differentially up and down regulated proteins at each time point . as shown in figure the differentially regulated phosphoproteins had different distributions among the go categories . phosphopeptides of kinases were significantly enriched for nearly all treatments consistent with the role of hormones as triggers of signal transduction cascades . many differentially phosphorylated proteins are involved in protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation including various families of kinases receptor like kinases _PROTEIN_ and protein phosphatases . a set of specific read outs for every hormone pathway is essential for dissecting the specific _METHOD_ of response to each hormone the interactions among hormones and the relationship between hormones and specific physiological effects . comparison of the phosphorylated proteins for each of the treatments showed some phosphorylation targets common to all of the hormones as well as some proteins whose phosphorylation state changes differentially for different hormones thus demonstrating hormone specific phosphorylation . peptides found in the intersection for a particular hormone and not regulated by any other hormone in this study are specific responsive phosphopeptides . these proteins included some well characterized proteins such as aba responsive element binding proteins and auxin transporters _PROTEIN_ induced by iaa . however many other specific responsive proteins have no known function and have not been previously associated with a hormone pathway . our screen found phosphopeptides corresponding to genes that are regulated by hormones . in total nine _PROTEIN_ were identified by our approach including two phosphorylation sites that had not been described previously . the nine _PROTEIN_ were differentially phosphorylated . seven phosphorylation sites for leucine rich repeat _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were identified . the phosphorylation state of two lrr kinases _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was increased at a c terminal site by aba and _PROTEIN_ by the other hormones after h. in addition another site in the kinase domain of _PROTEIN_ displayed increased phosphorylation after h of iaa treatment . kinase _PROTEIN_ showed increased phosphorylation at in the c terminus after h of ga treatment which suggests that the activity of this lrr _PROTEIN_ could be ga dependent . the _PROTEIN_ receptor kinase showed an increase in phosphorylation in the intracellular juxtamembrane domain for all treatments after h. another phosphopeptide from the intracellular juxtamembrane domain of _PROTEIN_ kinase showed a more moderate increase in response to iaa alone . it has been reported that the unphosphorylated juxtamembrane domain binds to the n terminal sequence of the kinase _PROTEIN_ it in an inactive conformation thus phosphorylation of the juxtamembrane domain could activate the kinase . this domain is highly variable among _PROTEIN_ family members indicating that there may be individual regulatory responses . in addition four phosphorylation sites were found for three soluble protein kinases . protein kinase _PROTEIN_ showed a _PROTEIN_ in phosphorylation in the n termimal region after being exposed to iaa and kinetin whereas a significant increase was detected for the other hormones after h. phosphorylation of protein kinase _PROTEIN_ was increased at two sites in the kinase domain after h by ga and ja . six _METHOD_ of calcium dependent protein kinases were identified with more than two phosphorylated peptides . at least one isoform was found for each time point indicating a significant role in phytohormone dependent signal transduction . a peptide assigned to one isoform of _PROTEIN_ was identified as the highest loading of for aba . it was highly induced by aba h after treatment . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed a strong increase in phosphorylation only after h of kinetin treatment indicating involvement in early signaling in response to kinetin . four new phosphorylation sites were identified for isoform _PROTEIN_ . those at and in the n terminus were up regulated by iaa and ja at h and remained at a constant level over extended time periods . however phosphorylation of another new site at was increased at h and reduced to half of the control level at h by iaa and ja . this peptide was also induced by ga after h. a previously described site in the n terminus showed dephosphorylation in response to all of the hormones . interestingly the new site in the kinase domain of _PROTEIN_ displayed a slight increase in phosphorylation in response to aba and ga after h followed by a strong increase after h. in contrast _PROTEIN_ showed similar phosphorylation levels when treated with iaa at both and h. phosphorylation at in the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ was increased after h of ga treatment peaked at h and returned to the control level at h. phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ was initiated by aba treatment after h peaked at h and then _PROTEIN_ . however the _PROTEIN_ level at h was still higher than that of the control suggesting that that the signal cascades differ between ga and aba responses . it appears that _PROTEIN_ is involved in cross talk between ga and aba signaling . aba and ga dependent plant development may be promoted through distinct signaling pathways that converge at the level of _PROTEIN_ . however further work is needed to dissect this mechanism . on the other hand the results suggest that the cdpk _METHOD_ may be involved in various pathways in response to hormones and demonstrate the functional divergence of proteins despite similar primary structure . several studies have reported that aba activation of protein kinases led to phosphorylation of aba responsive element binding proteins . in this study we identified a phosphopeptide of _PROTEIN_ that was responsive to aba . phosphorylation of kinases is often a key regulatory event in the downstream response . genetic evidence in yeast showed that the regulatory domain binds to the kinase domain and snrk kinase activity is regulated by the regulatory domain . a phosphorylation site was identified for _PROTEIN_ at in the n terminal part of the protein and its phosphorylation was induced by aba after h. a similar phosphopeptide was found for _PROTEIN_ in the n terminus of this protein . aba dependent phosphorylation of arebs has been suggested previously . here we describe conclusive identification of a phosphorylation site in the n terminus of an areb family protein . moreover this potential phosphorylation site is conserved in the n termini of all arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ type arebs suggesting that n terminal phosphorylation maybe a common way to regulate areb activity or affinity . the differentially phosphorylated proteins identified here show that aba activated protein kinases directly trigger phosphorylation of arebs in response to aba . these findings demonstrate a direct link between signaling components and transcriptional regulators in the aba response . the largest functional group regulated by the hormone treatments comprised genes encoding transport proteins . they can be divided into three sub groups ion transport proteins _PROTEIN_ peptide transporters auxin transporters sugar/monosaccharide transporters and _PROTEIN_ binding cassette transporters . phosphorylation of transporters is known to influence the activities of ion channels at _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ initiating a downstream response . of the phosphopeptides for ion transporters the phosphorylation state of eight was regulated by one or two hormones . for example the potassium transporter _PROTEIN_ and the sodium transporter _PROTEIN_ were regulated by aba another potassium transporter _PROTEIN_ and the sodium transporter nhx were regulated by iaa while two peptides for chloride transporters were regulated by iaa and kinetin . a magnesium transporter was regulated by ja alone while phosphorylation of a high affinity nitrate transporter was found to be down regulated exclusively by aba . one phosphorylation site at in the c terminus of ammonium transporter _PROTEIN_ was up regulated by ga and ja . _PROTEIN_ is one of the high abundance phosphoproteins in our analysis more than times phosphopeptides were identified for this protein . phosphorylation of the well described phosphorylation site at the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ was found to be increased by ga and iaa . a very similar phosphopeptide was identified for _PROTEIN_ and showed _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation by aba and ja and complete dephosphorylation by kinetin . in _PROTEIN_ all arabidopsis h _PROTEIN_ except _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ possess this threonine as a conserved potential phosphorylation site in their c terminus . previous studies suggested that phosphorylation of this site was increased by sucrose demonstrating that c terminal phosphorylation may be a common way to regulate _PROTEIN_ activity or affinity . two genes encoding _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were regulated by at least one hormone . _PROTEIN_ was another highly abundant phosphopeptide in aba treated samples . the spectral count for two peptides phosphorylated at and respectively in the n terminal region increased with the duration of hormone treatment and reached its peak after h of aba supply . it has been reported that this region is responsible for pump regulation through a calmodulin binding domain . phosphorylation of the _PROTEIN_ could increase the concentration and thus activate dependent k and channels . furthermore is well known as a ubiquitous intracellular second messenger in plants and an increase in the _LOCATION_ concentration of modulates a diverse array of signals and responses . the second sub group includes four _PROTEIN_ formed auxin transport proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . four phosphorylation sites were found for these proteins one for _PROTEIN_ at which was phosphorylated at h after iaa supply one for _PROTEIN_ one for _PROTEIN_ and one for _PROTEIN_ at . the relative amounts of the latter two phosphopeptides increased slightly after h of aba and iaa supply and reached a maximum after h. the time course of the phosphorylation changes for _PROTEIN_ with a significant specific increase after h and a slight _PROTEIN_ after h of iaa supply suggests that addition of external hormone led to rapid opening of the auxin transporter and a subsequent _PROTEIN_ response . there is ample evidence that hormones regulate genes that are involved in the metabolism of other hormones . therefore the regulation of auxin transporters indicates extensive cross talk and signal integration among growth regulating hormones . recently it was reported that auxin flux is regulated by _PROTEIN_ kinase mediated phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ proteins . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is also suggested to control _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in concert with _PROTEIN_ . in this study we found that _PROTEIN_ which belongs to the same kinase family as _PROTEIN_ and functions as a signal transducer in the _PROTEIN_ translocation of auxin was phosphorylated in an iaa dependent manner . _PROTEIN_ was also phosphorylated following iaa treatment . consequently we conclude that iaa activated _PROTEIN_ which in turn phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ and so acts on the cell _PROTEIN_ of auxin signaling pathways as summarized in figure . in those cases in which the site of phosphorylation could be determined it is indicated by ps for phosphoserine pt for phosphothreonine or py for phosphotyrosine . if the phosphorylation site could not be unambiguously determined this is indicated by small letters in parentheses . the peptides were ordered by protein functional classification in accordance with figure and peptides in the same category are ordered by the accession number . the protein cellular localization was performed using gene ontology program . seven pgp/mdr belonging to the _PROTEIN_ binding cassette transporter super family were also differentially phosphorylated . of nine abc transporters identified in this study five were regulated by at least one and two by two or more hormones after h. the results of sequence alignment indicate that all of the regulated phosphorylation sites are located in the central unconserved linker domain whose function in cfrt protein as a regulator of transport activity through phosphorylation is well established . in addition channel gating was controlled by kinase dependent phosphorylation . as that most phosphorylation changes of the pgps were observed after h and some kinases were induced shortly after treatment as indicated above hormones may activate protein kinases leading to phosphorylation of abc transporters and thereby regulating pump activity . tyrosine phosphatase _PROTEIN_ which was shown recently to be required for aba dependent processes in arabidopsis cell suspensions showed increased phosphorylation in the n terminal domain after aba and ga supply . phosphorylation of protein phosphatase was found to be increased at in a conserved catalytic domain by aba and ga after h. one phosphopeptide of the f box protein _PROTEIN_ was shown to be differentially phosphorylated by iaa and ga . recent studies demonstrated that phosphorylation of f box proteins could trigger formation of the _PROTEIN_ box complex and ligase activity . a single phosphorylation site of the well known _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ phosphoprotein calnexin was exclusively induced by ga. phosphorylation of calnexin is known to increase the concentration of calnexin in the proximity of the translocon and facilitate the translocation and folding of glycoproteins . these data indicate that ga induced phosphorylation activates efficient trafficking in the _LOCATION_ .

filtered through a layer of nylon cloth and the filtrate was centrifuged for min at g at . the pellet was discarded and the supernatant was centrifuged for min at g at . the pellet was resuspended in ml of suspension buffer r _METHOD_ . a g two phase polymer mixture was prepared with mm mm sucrose w/w dextrane t w/w peg and mm kcl . the _LOCATION_ suspension was added to the dextrane/peg mixture to give an g two phase system . the system was mixed well and centrifuged for min at g. the upper _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fraction was transferred to another new two phase mixture and centrifuged again at g. the central microsomal phase was diluted fivefold using the microsomal suspension buffer and centrifuged for min at g at . the supernatant was discarded and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ pellets were resuspended in buffer r as described above . to generate inside out vesicles brij was added . the inverted vesicles were subsequently briefly washed three times with and mm ice cold respectively finally the intracellular proteins were resuspended in mm and stored at . for in solution digestion mg of _LOCATION_ proteins were pre digested for h with endoproteinase lys c at room temperature . after fourfold dilution with acetonitrile and mm samples were digested overnight with immobilized trypsin at . equal amounts of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins were digested as described above by adding of immobilized trypsin to the final _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fraction solution . digestion was stopped by adding trifluoroacetic acid to . the trypsin beads and insoluble material were removed by centrifugation at g for min . samples were concentrated in a vacuum centrifuge either for phosphopeptide enrichment with titanium dioxide or direct analysis by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . tips were supplied by glygen inc. and the phosphopeptide enrichment procedures used were essentially those described by citation with some modifications . beads were equilibrated prior to binding of phosphopeptides by aspirating/expelling of mg/ml dihydroxybenzoic acid in acetonitrile and tfa . before binding the trypsin digested peptide lysate was adjusted to ph by adding tfa . each peptide mixture was then added to a ml reaction tube containing mg of the beads and incubated batchwise with end over end rotation for min . after incubation the beads were spun down at g and briefly washed once with acetonitrile tfa and once with acetonitrile tfa . finally bound peptides were eluted from the beads using in acetonitrile . eluates were immediately neutralized in tfa solvent and dried . the peptide mixture was separated and analyzed online by nanoflow reverse phase liquid chromatography using a cm fused silica monolithic column and an easy n lc nano liquid chromatography instrument _METHOD_ coupled to an

selected for collision induced dissociation with target value of ions in the ltq . to improve the fragmentation of phosphopeptides multi stage activation was enabled for each _METHOD_ spectrum . when a neutral loss of or _METHOD_ was detected following activation of the precursor ion the neutral loss peptide fragments were dissociated further generating a variety of structurally informative fragments . product ions produced during the initial activation of isolated precursor ions _METHOD_ and all subsequent neutral loss activations _METHOD_ were simultaneously stored resulting in composite _METHOD_ spectra for phosphopeptide identification . figure shows the outline of the proteomic approach . briefly raw data files were converted to mzxml format using the readw program from the institute for _METHOD_ biology . the spectral counts of all ions that were subjected to dissociation in each analysis were extracted from the mzxml files and entered into a _PROTEIN_ using the protmax algorithm . each column vector contains the quantities of all peptides subjected to dissociation and is a component wise description of a shotgun proteomics analysis each row vector describes the abundance of a respective peptide ion over the entire set of analyses . each column was normalized to its total spectral count . the values were then transformed to _PROTEIN_ values . independent

manually validated and various combinations of phosphorylation sites were scored _PROTEIN_ for each peptide by matching the observed b and y ions to theoretical b and y ions and the highest scoring match was accepted if the mascot score was greater than the _PROTEIN_ score was greater than and extensive coverage of b and/or y ion series was found . all _METHOD_ spectra and metadata of the
