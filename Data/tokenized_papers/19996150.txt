cutinase is an esterase that degrades the polyester cutin a major component of the plant cuticle . although cutinase activity has been detected in pollen the genes encoding this enzyme have not been identified . here we report the identification and characterization of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a novel candidate gene encoding cutinase . _PROTEIN_ encodes a member of the gdsl lipase/esterase family of proteins although fungal and bacterial cutinases belong to the hydrolase superfamily which is different from the gdsl lipase/esterase family . according to the atgenexpress microarray data _PROTEIN_ is predominantly _PROTEIN_ in pollen . the ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ driven by the promoter caused fusion of organs including leaves _METHOD_ and flowers and increased surface permeability . ultrastructural analysis revealed that the cuticle of the transgenic plants was often disrupted and became discontinuous . subcellular analysis with green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ showed that the protein is secreted to the _LOCATION_ space in leaves . the recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein has esterase activity . these results are consistent with cutinase being secreted from cells and directly degrading the polyester in the cuticle . _PROTEIN_ promoter activity was detected in mature pollen and pollen tubes suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is involved in the penetration of the stigma by pollen tubes . additionally we found _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ at the zone of _PROTEIN_ root emergence which suggests that _PROTEIN_ degrades cell wall components to facilitate the emergence of the _PROTEIN_ roots . our findings suggest that _PROTEIN_ is a candidate gene for the unidentified plant cutinase .
_PROTEIN_ of a fungal cutinase in a. thaliana disrupted the cuticle of the plant leading to the fusion of various organs . . this observation suggests that the _PROTEIN_ of cutinase in aerial parts of a plant may abolish normal cuticular development . additionally endogenous cutinase activity in plants has been reported only in pollen . these results imply that plant cutinase genes are _PROTEIN_ specifically in restricted plant tissues such as pollen . to identify plant cutinases we examined two gene families the hydrolase superfamily and the gdsl lipase/esterase family . arabidopsis contains genes of the hydrolase superfamily and genes of the gdsl lipase/esterase family . we constructed a heat map of gene _PROTEIN_ profiles of the hydrolase superfamily using developmental data from atgenexpress and selected four genes that are specifically _PROTEIN_ in mature pollen . we also generated a heat map of gene _PROTEIN_ profiles of the gdsl lipase/esterase family and identified two genes that are specifically _PROTEIN_ in mature pollen . we hypothesized that the ectopic _PROTEIN_ of a plant cutinase would cause cuticular defects similar to those observed upon _PROTEIN_ of the fusarium cutinase . we cloned a cdna for each of the candidate genes from arabidopsis flowers ectopically _PROTEIN_ the proteins in vegetative organs and established multiple lines for each transgenic plant . we examined cuticular function using a toluidine blue test . plants with an abnormal cuticle are readily stained with tb because of the increased permeability of their surface . transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ _GENE_ or were not stained with tb . in contrast transgenic plants with _GENE_ were stained strongly with tb we established seven independent lines carrying _GENE_ and all these transgenic plants were stained with tb . this result suggests that these transgenic plants have a defect in the cuticle . we named _GENE_ cuticle destructing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and further characterized the protein . to confirm the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene in leaves of the transgenic _PROTEIN_ plant we performed a reverse transcription pcr analysis . the _PROTEIN_ gene was _PROTEIN_ in leaves of transgenic _PROTEIN_ plants but not in those of wild type plants . we found that transgenic _PROTEIN_ plants occasionally exhibited organ fusions while wild type plants never had fused organs . this phenotype is strongly correlated with the structural abnormalities of the cuticle . the organ fusions occurred in various organs including leaves _METHOD_ and flowers suggesting that the cuticular structure was disordered in the organs of the transgenic _PROTEIN_ plants . fusions of the organs of flowers prevented normal flower development and such a fused flower did not normally develop a silique resulting in the reduction of fertility . a similar phenotype was observed in the case of ectopic _PROTEIN_ of fusarium cutinase . overall these results suggest that the ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ causes the loss of cuticular integrity in vegetative organs such as leaves _METHOD_ and flowers . to examine the integrity of the cuticle leaf epidermal cells of transgenic plants were examined by electron microscopy . in this analysis we used transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ a green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein that caused cuticular defects similar to those seen in plants constitutively overexpressing _PROTEIN_ . the cuticle of wild type plants appeared to be a smooth and continuous layer with a high electron density . in contrast the cuticle of transgenic plants was often disrupted and became discontinuous . the appearance of the deformed cuticle varied among the specimens examined . the cuticle often disappeared . in some areas the cuticle was torn and cell wall materials were deposited between the torn cuticular layers . these observations suggest that ectopic _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene causes disruption of the cuticle . a hydropathy plot analysis revealed the existence of a possible signal peptide which could sort this protein into the secretory pathway at the n terminus of the _PROTEIN_ protein . to investigate the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ by monitoring _METHOD_ _METHOD_ the sp _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion gene was _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . the transgenic plants stained readily with tb and occasionally exhibited an organ fusion phenotype indicating that _METHOD_ did not affect the localization or activity of _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ signals in the leaves of day old transgenic plants were detected in the _LOCATION_ space . this result indicates that _PROTEIN_ is secreted and accumulates in the _LOCATION_ space . cutinases are esterases that cleave various mono and polyesters including synthetic esters and native cutin . fig . shows an alignment of the amino acid sequences of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ a gdsl lipase/esterase protein from arabidopsis which was previously reported to exhibit esterase activity . this alignment revealed that _PROTEIN_ has conserved motifs typical of the gdsl lipase/esterase family of proteins and contains the invariant residues that form the catalytic triad and oxyanion hole . this result implies that _PROTEIN_ has esterase activity . to verify the enzymatic activity of the protein we _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ in suspension cultures of by tobacco cells and examined the enzymatic activity . the recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein with a his tag at its c terminus was efficiently _PROTEIN_ in by cells and secreted into the culture medium . recombinant _PROTEIN_ was purified with an affinity column and appeared as a single band on a _METHOD_ stained _PROTEIN_ polyacrylamide gel . purified _PROTEIN_ exhibited esterase activity towards p nitrophenyl butyrate and this activity was reduced to < of the maximum activity by heating for min at . the optimum ph of this enzyme was broad in the range of ph and activity slightly _PROTEIN_ at acidic ph values . the specific activity was determined to be _PROTEIN_ protein . to analyze the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ we performed a promoter analysis using the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein as a reporter . in this analysis we used a bp region upstream of _PROTEIN_ as a promoter and a bp region downstream of the stop codon as a terminator . _METHOD_ signals were detected in mature pollen grains within non dehiscent anthers and in pollen tubes that were germinating on the stigma . interestingly a _METHOD_ signal was detected as a patchy pattern in primary roots and in restricted regions of the primary root periderm where _PROTEIN_ roots were emerging . these _PROTEIN_ patterns may be correlated with the emergence of _PROTEIN_ roots . these results were consistent with the atgenexpress developmental data which showed that the _PROTEIN_ gene is highly _PROTEIN_ in mature pollen and is _PROTEIN_ at low levels in roots .
