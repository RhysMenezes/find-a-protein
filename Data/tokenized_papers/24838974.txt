it is not known how plants make the benzenoid _PROTEIN_ of ubiquinone a vital respiratory cofactor . here we demonstrate that arabidopsis thaliana uses for that purpose two separate biosynthetic branches stemming from phenylalanine and tyrosine . gene network modeling and characterization of t dna mutants indicated that acyl activating enzyme encoded by _GENE_ contributes to the biosynthesis of ubiquinone specifically from phenylalanine . coa ligase assays verified that _GENE_ prefers para coumarate ferulate and caffeate as substrates . feeding experiments demonstrated that the _GENE_ knockout can not use para coumarate for ubiquinone biosynthesis and that the supply of hydroxybenzoate the side chain shortened version of para coumarate can bypass this blockage . furthermore a trans cinnamate hydroxylase mutant which is impaired in the conversion of trans cinnamate into para coumarate displayed similar defects in ubiquinone biosynthesis to that of the _GENE_ knockout . green _METHOD_ protein fusion experiments demonstrated that _GENE_ occurs in _LOCATION_ resulting in an elaborate biosynthetic architecture where phenylpropanoid intermediates have to be transported from the _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ and then to mitochondria where ubiquinone is assembled . collectively these results demonstrate that _GENE_ activates the propyl side chain of para coumarate for its subsequent oxidative shortening . evidence is shown that the peroxisomal abcd transporter _PROTEIN_ plays a critical role in this branch .
when axenic cultures of arabidopsis were given identical doses of uniformly labeled phenylalanine or tyrosine ultraperformance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis of the corresponding extracts readily detected the ion pairs characteristic of ubiquinone _PROTEIN_ . the isotopic enrichment of the benzoquinone _PROTEIN_ was twice as high with phe as with tyr in both shoots and roots . importantly isotopes of ubiquinone heavier than those labeled at the six _PROTEIN_ positions were not detected indicating that only the aromatic moiety of phe and tyr had been incorporated into ubiquinone . because _METHOD_ appear to be unable to convert phenylalanine into tyrosine we inferred that the incorporation of these two aromatic amino acids into ubiquinone might occur unlike in vertebrates via two independent pathways . in stark contrast with yeast arabidopsis did not incorporate paba into ubiquinone . mining the _PROTEIN_ ii coexpression database with genes involved in the assembly of the respiratory chain as queries detected gene _GENE_ as a remarkable node interactor . the cognate kd protein features a conserved domain found in coumarate coa ligases and previous studies confirmed that recombinant _GENE_ displays coa ligase activity with some hydroxycinnamate derivatives as substrates . two of _GENE_ s strongest interactors solanesyl diphosphate a _PROTEIN_ ortholog and abc _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ ortholog encode for enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of ubiquinone . expanding the network reconstruction to the top genes that coexpress with _GENE_ and _PROTEIN_ revealed that _GENE_ shares of its interactors with and/or _PROTEIN_ . of those are shared uniquely with uniquely with _PROTEIN_ and with both and _PROTEIN_ . it thus appears that the function of _GENE_ is intimately connected to the mitochondrial electron and proton transport chain and more specifically to ubiquinone biosynthesis . it should also be noted that _GENE_ displays a c terminal serargleu tripeptide typifying a peroxisomal targeting signal we will come back to this point _PROTEIN_ . two mutants corresponding to t dna insertions located in the first exon and fifth intron of _GENE_ respectively were identified using the t dna _PROTEIN_ gene mapping tool of the salk institute and confirmed by dna genotyping . rt pcr analyses demonstrated that the insertion in line resulted in a knockdown mutation while that of line corresponded to a genuine knockout . both t dna lines were visually indistinguishable from wild type plants . however quantification of ubiquinone showed that its levels correlated with the _PROTEIN_ of _GENE_ lines and displaying and _PROTEIN_ in ubiquinone content compared with wild type plants respectively . similarly overexpression of _GENE_ cdna in two independent arabidopsis transgenic lines resulted in the accumulation of ubiquinone to of wild type content . furthermore when phe was fed to the _GENE_ knockout the isotopic enrichment of ubiquinone _PROTEIN_ was half of that found in the wild type control . on the other hand no statistically significant difference in isotope incorporation was observed between knockout and wild type plants when tyr was given to the plants . all together these results demonstrate that _GENE_ is involved in the biosynthesis of the benzenoid moiety of ubiquinone via the phenylalanine route . previous investigations of the in vitro substrate preference of acyl activating enzymes reported conflicting data for _GENE_ one study mentioning marginal activity with caffeate and ferulate only while a _PROTEIN_ study showed that the enzyme possessed conspicuous activity with t cinnamate p coumarate caffeate and ferulate as well as with various aliphatic acids . to clarify this point an n terminally tagged version of _GENE_ was codon optimized for _PROTEIN_ in e. coli purified and assayed using a standard spectrophotometric method with coa _PROTEIN_ and t cinnamate p coumarate ferulate caffeate sinapate hydroxybenzoate or acetate as substrates . coa ligase activity was readily detected with t cinnamate p coumarate ferulate and caffeate allowing further investigation of _GENE_ s kinetic properties . km kcat and kcat/km values determined with p coumarate ferulate and caffeate were similar . the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme with t cinnamate was only to of that measured with p coumarate ferulate or caffeate owing to a lower kcat value with this substrate . overall the kinetic parameters of _GENE_ determined with t cinnamate p coumarate ferulate and caffeate were similar to those previously reported for plant p coumarate and t cinnamate coa ligases . notably as is usually observed for p coumarate coa ligases no activity was detected with sinapate the _PROTEIN_ of which is methoxylated on while t cinnamate p coumarate ferulate and caffeate are unsubstituted at this position . anecdotal catalytic efficiency was found with hydroxybenzoate while no activity could be detected with acetate . these data thus verify that recombinant _GENE_ is predominantly active with t cinnamate p coumarate ferulate and caffeate although they say nothing about which of these substrates might actually play a role in ubiquinone biosynthesis in vivo . assays with plant extracts did not show any statistically significant difference in coa ligase activity between wild type and _GENE_ knockout plants . to gain some insight into the architecture of the metabolic branch of which _GENE_ belongs to ubiquinone levels were determined in wild type and _GENE_ knockout plants fed with t cinnamate p coumarate ferulate or caffeate or with their corresponding shortened aliphatic side chain versions i.e. benzoate hydroxybenzoate vanillate or dihydroxybenzoate respectively . feeding wild type plants with t cinnamate p coumarate and hydroxybenzoate increased ubiquinone content by compared with the _METHOD_ control whereas only hydroxybenzoate restored ubiquinone biosynthesis in the _GENE_ knockout . because t cinnamate is the immediate precursor of p coumarate and plants are able to derive hydroxybenzoate from p coumarate our results strongly suggest that t cinnamate p coumarate and hydroxybenzoate are used as precursors of ubiquinone via the same metabolic branch . that ubiquinone biosynthesis in the _GENE_ knockout is rescued exclusively by hydroxybenzoate would therefore indicate that the loss of function of _GENE_ creates a metabolic blockage upstream of hydroxybenzoate and downstream of t cinnamate and p coumarate . agreeing with such a model an arabidopsis reduced epidermal _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ leaky mutant that displays reduced cinnamate hydroxylase activity and is thus impaired in its ability to convert t cinnamate into p coumarate contained only of wild type ubiquinone level and displayed a _PROTEIN_ in isotopic enrichment of ubiquinone _PROTEIN_ from phe . as observed for the _GENE_ knockout the incorporation of tyr into ubiquinone in the _PROTEIN_ mutant remained intact . taken together these results are consistent with _GENE_ operating as a coa ligase that activates the propyl side chain of p coumarate for its subsequent oxidative shortening leading to hydroxybenzoate . homology searches across terrestrial plant lineages showed that the putative orthologs of _GENE_ display the hallmark stringent conservation of an authentic peroxisomal targeting sequence . coexpression experiments in nicotiana benthamiana mesophyll cells confirmed that the green pseudocolor of the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fused to the n terminus of _GENE_ strictly colocalized with the red pseudocolor of a red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged fragment of keto acyl coa thiolase in _LOCATION_ . control coexpression of the _METHOD_ _GENE_ fusion protein with _METHOD_ tagged isovaleryl coa dehydrogenase verified that the _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ was not associated with mitochondria . that _GENE_ is localized in _LOCATION_ while cinnamate hydroxylase is bound to the endomembrane system in the _LOCATION_ implies that p coumarate might be transported into _LOCATION_ . reexamination of the functional network indentified the _LOCATION_ abc subfamily d transporter or _PROTEIN_ as one of the interacting genes shared between _GENE_ and . quinone analysis showed that the _PROTEIN_ knockout contained less ubiquinone than the wild type control and that as observed for the _GENE_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants such a loss was exclusively attributable to a _PROTEIN_ in biosynthetic flux from phenylalanine . feeding experiments showed that of t cinnamate p coumarate and hydroxybenzoate only the latter rescued ubiquinone biosynthesis in the _PROTEIN_ knockout demonstrating that here again the metabolic blockage occurred between p coumarate and hydroxybenzoate . further verifying that the impact of the _PROTEIN_ mutation on quinone metabolism is specific to ubiquinone biosynthesis no statistically significant difference in the levels of _PROTEIN_ the naphthoquinone _PROTEIN_ of which is made in part in _LOCATION_ was observed between the _PROTEIN_ mutant and the wild type control
