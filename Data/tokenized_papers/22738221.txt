rhomboids are intra _LOCATION_ serine proteases whose sequences are found in nearly all _METHOD_ . they are involved in a variety of biological functions in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes . localization assays revealed that two arabidopsis thaliana rhomboid like proteases _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are targeted to the chloroplast . using transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ epitope tagged _PROTEIN_ we localized _PROTEIN_ to the chloroplast inner envelope _LOCATION_ with both its n and c termini facing the stroma . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analyses confirmed this localization and suggested that this is also the case for _PROTEIN_ . both are proteins of very low abundance . the results of size exclusion chromatography implied that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ homo oligomers . in search of a putative function a comparative proteomic analysis was performed on wild type and double knockout plants lacking both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ using the itraq method . of envelope proteins the level of only a few was either increased or _PROTEIN_ in the mutant line . one of the latter allene oxide synthase is involved in jasmonic acid biosynthesis . this observation provides an explanation for the recently reported aberration in flower morphology that is associated with the loss of _PROTEIN_ .
in order to identify and characterize chloroplast rhomboid like proteases we searched for putative arabidopsis thaliana rhomboid like proteins using protein blast in the national center for biotechnology information server . our final list of putative atrbls was composed strictly of proteins containing the conserved residues asparagine serine and histidine in the appropriate positions with the serine located within the conserved gasg motif on the assumption that such proteins will be active . once the set of putatively active atrbls was established we searched for predicted chloroplast targeted proteins using subcellular localization prediction software . there have been cases of ambiguity in the targeting signals thus a mitochondrial targeting prediction was also considered as a possible chloroplast targeting prediction . the strongest chloroplast targeting prediction consensus was found for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but a weaker or no consensus was found for _PROTEIN_ . p _LOCATION_ m mitochondria o other . the putatively active atrbls are listed . loci and protein ids correspond to data retrieved from the national center for biotechnology information database . anomenclature according to lemberg and freeman . at the onset of our study experimental data _PROTEIN_ rhomboid localization in arabidopsis was available only for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which were both found to localize to the _LOCATION_ apparatus . thus we determined the localization of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . to this end we fused the cdna sequences encoding the n termini of these proteins to that of _METHOD_ transiently _PROTEIN_ the chimeric genes in arabidopsis protoplasts and monitored the accumulation of _METHOD_ using confocal microscopy . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ co localized with the mitochondrial reporter mitotracker similarly to the pattern for the mitochondrial control _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ suggesting mitochondrial localization of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ co localized with chlorophyll _METHOD_ similar to the chloroplast control _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ suggesting their chloroplast localization . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ co localized neither with mitotracker nor with chlorophyll _METHOD_ . however it showed an _PROTEIN_ pattern that was distinct from that of _METHOD_ alone suggesting it is localized elsewhere than the cystosol _METHOD_ mitochondria or chloroplasts . the chloroplast localization of _PROTEIN_ and was further confirmed using chloroplast import assays of full length in vitro synthesized proteins into isolated pea chloroplasts . although import efficiency is low it is apparent that both _PROTEIN_ and were imported into chloroplasts underwent maturation and partitioned with the _LOCATION_ fraction . to examine the sub chloroplast _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in vivo we generated transgenic arabidopsis lines _PROTEIN_ c terminally ha tagged proteins only the _PROTEIN_ ha transgenic lines accumulated detectable levels of the protein . as expected _PROTEIN_ ha was detected in total protein extracts and isolated chloroplasts of both _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines and was not detected in wild type plants . to determine its sub chloroplast localization intact chloroplasts were isolated lysed and fractionated into _LOCATION_ and envelope _LOCATION_ . samples were immunoblotted using marker antibodies for _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and envelopes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . consistent with their known localization _PROTEIN_ was detected only in _LOCATION_ whereas _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were found exclusively in the envelope . the _PROTEIN_ ha distribution pattern follows that of the envelope proteins . when envelope preparations of various plant lines were probed with an _PROTEIN_ specific antibody a band was detected at the expected size in wt the _PROTEIN_ knockout mutant and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic line but not in an _PROTEIN_ knockout line . the band detected by the _PROTEIN_ antibody in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic line was the same size as the one detected by the ha antibody further confirming that _PROTEIN_ localizes to the envelope . interestingly these results are consistent with the results of a proteomic analysis of chloroplast envelopes . as the vast majority of outer envelope proteins are not subjected to maturation whereas both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ underwent maturation during protein import these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ localizes to the inner envelope _LOCATION_ . to determine the topology of _PROTEIN_ in the inner envelope _LOCATION_ we performed protease protection assays in intact chloroplasts . this method is based on the differential permeability of the outer envelope _LOCATION_ to trypsin and thermolysin thermolysin can not penetrate the oem and therefore degrades only proteins on the outer surface of the chloroplast whereas trypsin penetrates the oem and degrades proteins located both on the outer surface of the chloroplast and in the inter _LOCATION_ space . intact chloroplasts isolated from _PROTEIN_ ha plants were treated with both proteases and the degradation pattern of _PROTEIN_ ha was monitored . _PROTEIN_ an outer envelope protein facing the _LOCATION_ was efficiently degraded in the presence of either thermolysin or trypsin whereas _PROTEIN_ an outer envelope protein was resistant to thermolysin but degraded in the presence of trypsin . a similar pattern was observed for _PROTEIN_ an inner envelope protein whose soluble domain faces the inter _LOCATION_ space . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ degradation patterns confirmed that trypsin did indeed penetrate the oem and was also active in the inter _LOCATION_ space . _PROTEIN_ a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein facing the stroma was mostly resistant to both proteases suggesting that trypsin at the concentration used did not substantially penetrate the inner envelope _LOCATION_ . in the presence of triton x which disrupts _LOCATION_ compartmentalization _PROTEIN_ was fully degraded by trypsin but not by thermolysin . the ha signal was resistant to thermolysin treatment even in the presence of triton x only slight processing was observed . the signal also resisted trypsin at the high concentration of but was degraded when detergent was added . although it is not clear why both _PROTEIN_ and the ha signal resisted thermolysin treatment in the presence of detergent the ha degradation pattern in the presence of either protease best resembles that of _PROTEIN_ suggesting that the ha tag faces the stroma . to rule out the possibility that the ha signal was resistant to trypsin due to embedding within the _LOCATION_ intact and hypotonically lysed chloroplasts were treated with increasing trypsin concentrations . chloroplast lysis reduces the protective effect of _LOCATION_ compartmentalization but does not affect _LOCATION_ embedding of the proteins . comparing the protection pattern of _PROTEIN_ and the ha signal suggested that their sensitivity to trypsin increases following chloroplast lysis . both _PROTEIN_ and the ha signal appeared to slightly degrade when intact chloroplasts were treated however when hypotonically lysed chloroplasts were treated degradation was far more efficient . these results confirm that the ha tag is protected from trypsin due to _LOCATION_ compartmentalization and not _LOCATION_ embedding and that like _PROTEIN_ it faces the stroma . as _PROTEIN_ is predicted to contain six transmembrane helices and was tagged at its c terminus it may be concluded that _PROTEIN_ is located in the inner envelope _LOCATION_ with both its n and c termini facing the stroma . we have often noted that the ha antibody recognizes more than one band . this is reminiscent of similar observations in bacterial rhomboids . most characteristic was the additional band at approximately kda and higher molecular weight bands were also observed in some cases . the predicted size of the mature protein _PROTEIN_ from the _PROTEIN_ ha construct is kda suggesting that the higher molecular weight bands may represents oligomers that are too hydrophobic to dissociate even under the high reducing conditions of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ similar to the case of the and proteins of the photosystem ii complex . to assess the size of the potential oligomer intact chloroplasts were isolated from transgenic plants solubilized using the mild detergent n dodecyl d maltoside and fractionated on a superose column . the relevant fractions were pooled concentrated and fractionated on a sephacryl column . analysis of the obtained fractions using the ha antibody revealed that the peak of _PROTEIN_ ha eluted at a volume corresponding to a size of approximately kda . as the mean size of ddm micelles is kda the _PROTEIN_ ha oligomer has a size of kda . in immunoprecipitation experiments performed on intact chloroplasts solubilized by ddm followed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tryptic digestion and _METHOD_ peptide fingerprint analysis most identified peptides belonged to peptides of _PROTEIN_ ha suggesting that it does not form a stable complex with any other protein . _PROTEIN_ peptides were recovered not only from the gel piece corresponding to the monomer size but also from pieces corresponding to the high molecular weight bands in the immunoblots . the sequence coverage map of the recovered peptides also suggested that processing of _PROTEIN_ occurs at or closely downstream of the site predicted by the chlorop program . taken together the monomer size of kda and the observed kda complex imply that _PROTEIN_ ha may form a homo oligomer of three to four subunits . however we do not know at this stage whether oligomerization of _PROTEIN_ has any functional significance . to determine the physiological role of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ corresponding t dna insertion lines were obtained backcrossed to wt and crossed between _METHOD_ to produce double knockouts . under all growth conditions tested these single and double knockout plants presented a wt phenotype . additional characteristics of the knockout lines such as germination rates total protein content total chlorophyll content and their photosystem ii activity measured by chlorophyll _METHOD_ were also the same as in wt . we therefore used a comparative proteomic approach and searched for envelope proteins whose level is affected by loss of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . a total of peptides were identified and quantified allowing for the quantitative comparison of proteins . localization analysis of the identified proteins using the at_chloro database showed that only of the identified proteins are not envelope residents suggesting relatively low cross contamination of the analyzed envelope fractions by other compartments . protein targets for rhomboid cleavage are expected to be more abundant in line compared to wt . this was observed for proteins with a reduction of > compared with the wt . these proteins are thus candidate substrates of chloroplast rhomboid proteases . for six of these proteins not all detected peptides were affected uniformly . in three of them the levels of peptides derived from the n terminus were lower in the wt than in the mutant and for three proteins the levels of c terminal peptides were reduced . apparently the cleavage products that were generated from the target protein by rhomboid cleavage were not equally detectable . this may be explained by differences in the stability of the cleavage products or differential release of either the n or the c terminal cleavage product from the envelope . probable direct targets for limited proteolysis by chloroplast rhomboids include _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and an amino oxidase family protein . for the remaining five proteins peptides from the entire length of the protein were similarly affected i.e . were more abundant in the mutant than in the wt . these proteins may also be direct targets of rhomboid proteases and thus more abundant in the rhomboid loss of function mutant . the most likely candidates in this group proteins whose level is ca . fold higher in the mutant compared to wt are _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and an aldo/keto reductase family protein . alternatively an unknown regulatory process may have been affected in the mutant resulting in accumulation of these proteins . for proteins the opposite effect was observed i.e . they were more abundant in the wt and showed a reduction of > in mutant line . for six of these proteins all detected peptides showed a similar _PROTEIN_ in the mutant . these proteins are not likely to be substrates of rhomboids but may be indirectly affected by rhomboid activity via a regulatory protein that is subject to rhomboid cleavage in the mutant . they include a math domain protein _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and an unknown protein . for seven of the proteins only peptides derived from either the n or the c terminus were reduced in the mutant rather than the entire length of the protein . as these proteins can not be direct targets of rhomboids proteases because of the lower level of some peptides in the mutant the differential accumulation of different parts of the protein remains unexplained . to follow up the itraq results we performed an immunoblot analysis on selected proteins from the two representative groups . _PROTEIN_ which contains a single transmembrane domain similar to known rhomboid substrates was not affected by the loss of _PROTEIN_ and/or _PROTEIN_ . similarly the level and size of _PROTEIN_ which has been implied to be processed by the _GENE_ gene product were not affected . however the _PROTEIN_ protein displayed a pattern similar to the one observed in the itraq experiments i.e . wt plants accumulated more _PROTEIN_ compared to the double knockout plants confirming that _PROTEIN_ is indeed indirectly affected by the loss of _PROTEIN_ and/or _PROTEIN_ . interestingly this effect on _PROTEIN_ abundance is not at the transcript level as the _PROTEIN_ transcript abundance in wt and the double knockout is similar . these results establish a link between the presence of chloroplast rhomboid proteases in the envelope and accumulation of _PROTEIN_ an enzyme in the jasmonic acid biosynthesis pathway that resides in the same _LOCATION_ .
