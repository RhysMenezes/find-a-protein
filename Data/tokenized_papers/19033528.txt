phosphatidylinositol monophosphate kinases produce phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate and have been implicated in vesicle trafficking and cytoskeletal rearrangements . here we adopted a reverse genetics approach to investigate the function of the arabidopsis thaliana pollen _PROTEIN_ gene encoding phosphatidylinositol monophosphate kinase _PROTEIN_ . pollen germination tube growth and _PROTEIN_ were significantly impaired in homozygous mutant plants lacking _PROTEIN_ transcript . in vitro supplementation with ptdins rescued these phenotypes . in vivo mutant pollen fertilized ovules leading to normal seed set and silique length . however fertilization took longer than in wild type plants and the _PROTEIN_ null mutant allele was transmitted through the pollen at a reduced frequency . analysis of endocytic events using suggested a reduction in endocytosis and _LOCATION_ recycling in _PROTEIN_ null mutant pollen tubes . imaging of elongating tobacco pollen tubes transiently transformed with a _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein fusion construct revealed that the protein localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ particularly in the subapical region . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ delocalized the protein to the apical region of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ perturbed pollen tube growth and caused apical cell wall _PROTEIN_ . thus _PROTEIN_ plays a crucial role in regulating the _PROTEIN_ of pollen tubes . this study supports a model for _LOCATION_ secretion and recycling where the apical and subapical regions appear to contain the components required to promote and sustain growth .
_PROTEIN_ kinases use as a substrate for the synthesis of ptdins . several _METHOD_ have been characterized in animal cells but only one has been reported for yeast _METHOD_ . in arabidopsis nine genes of this b subfamily _PROTEIN_ in different tissues were identified by genome analysis . to select and characterize our genes of interest we determined which arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ kinase genes are _PROTEIN_ in pollen using the genevestigator portal . this in silico tool suggested that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are highly _PROTEIN_ in pollen . to confirm the tissue specific _PROTEIN_ the promoter region of each gene was fused to a reporter gene encoding _PROTEIN_ and transformed into arabidopsis plants . histochemical staining of tissues from transgenic plants demonstrated high gus activity in the pollen grains within the anthers and in germinated pollen tubes but not in pistils leaves roots or root hairs of young seedlings . to confirm that the isolated _PROTEIN_ kinases encode functional enzymes a yeast mutant phenotype rescue assay was performed . saccharomyces cerevisae _METHOD_ is the functional homolog of mammalian type i _PROTEIN_ kinase and we tested the ability of the isolated arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ kinases genes to complement the _METHOD_ temperature sensitive mutant . _METHOD_ wild type cells transformed with the empty vector were used as a positive control and mutant _METHOD_ cells transformed with the empty vector were used as a negative control . when the cells were incubated at the permissive temperature all of the transformed yeast cells grew normally . however in the replica plate incubated at the restrictive temperature _METHOD_ cells transformed with the empty vector did not grow whereas _METHOD_ cells transformed with the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes from arabidopsis were viable . these results indicate that the coding regions of the isolated _PROTEIN_ kinases encode functional enzymes . a reverse genetics approach was used to evaluate the function of _PROTEIN_ kinases in pollen . by screening the salk institute genomic analysis laboratory collection for t dna insertion mutants we retrieved one t dna insertion in the _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ and one t dna insertion in the _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ . no t dna insertion lines were identified for the _PROTEIN_ gene . dna sequencing of the regions adjacent to the t dna left border confirmed that in the _PROTEIN_ gene the insertion was found to disrupt the coding sequence in the first exon downstream of the initiation codon as had been previously observed by citation . similarly in the _PROTEIN_ gene the insertion was found to disrupt the coding sequence also in the first exon . rt pcr analysis of homozygous mutant lines showed a null _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ confirming that the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ homozygous mutant plants are knockout mutants . the pollen grains from _PROTEIN_ homozygous flowers were found to be indistinguishable from wild type pollen in shape and size . the diamidino phenylindole staining showed correctly differentiated normal sized vegetative and sperm cell _LOCATION_ . alexander and aniline blue staining revealed that there were no abnormalities in the cytoplasm or wall of the pollen grain or in callose accumulation . however their germination efficiency under in vitro conditions was significantly lower than that of the wild type controls . furthermore the germinated _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes were shorter and exhibited a significantly higher percentage of abnormal morphologies namely partial loss of _PROTEIN_ and deformed and/or branch like growth . in wild type pollen the frequency of abnormal morphologies was found to be a percentage that increased to in _PROTEIN_ cells . these observations suggested that _PROTEIN_ is important for pollen germination and plays a crucial role in the _PROTEIN_ of tip growth . to confirm this phenotype we evaluated two _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion lines complemented with a construct _PROTEIN_ the full length cdna of _PROTEIN_ driven by its own promoter . upon confirmation of the t dna insertion and of the complementation pollen from both lines was grown and phenotype rescue was observed . germination efficiency was restored to values near those of the wild type and no significant morphological differences could be found between wild type and complemented pollen . an analysis of pollen from _PROTEIN_ homozygous flowers revealed no significant differences compared with wild type pollen with _PROTEIN_ to shape size and germination efficiency . furthermore genetic analysis of the progeny of _PROTEIN_ heterozygous plants showed that the _PROTEIN_ allele segregated at the expected mendelian ratio . thus further studies focused on _PROTEIN_ mutant plants only . despite the defect in in vitro pollen tube growth the siliques produced by _PROTEIN_ homozygous mutant plants were similar to those of wild type plants . a comparison of silique length seed count incidence of seed gaps and incidence of deformed seeds revealed no significant differences between _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants . however the impairment of pollen germination and pollen tube growth observed in vitro suggests that the _PROTEIN_ mutation may result in _PROTEIN_ pollen fitness and competitiveness in vivo . such alterations should result in a distorted transmission rate of the _PROTEIN_ and wild type alleles to the progeny of heterozygous _PROTEIN_ plants . hence we performed a genetic analysis of self fertilized _PROTEIN_ plants to evaluate if the mutant allele is transmitted to progeny in the expected mendelian ratio . genotyping of individual plants in the progeny populations was achieved by pcr using sets of primers annealing to dna within the t dna sequence and on either side of the insertion site . we observed reduced transmission of the mutant allele to the progeny suggesting a potential defect in either male or female gametophyte . to assess whether the defect was due to a problem in the male and/or female gametophytes reciprocal outcrosses were performed between plants heterozygous for the _PROTEIN_ allele and wild type plants . when pollen of a mutant heterozygote was used to pollinate wild type stigmas there were significantly fewer heterozygotes in the progeny than predicted by mendelian genetics . this indicates a strong and unequivocal male specific transmission defect in reciprocal outcrosses and an important role for _PROTEIN_ in pollen function . most interestingly when wild type pollen was used to pollinate _PROTEIN_ heterozygous plants the progeny demonstrated a small deviation from the expected mendelian ratio of heterozygotes to the wild type . this deviation is very close to the significance values but suggests that disruption of _PROTEIN_ also mildly affects the female gametophyte . segregation analysis of the _PROTEIN_ mutant allele self cross of _PROTEIN_ heterozygous plants segregation analysis of the _PROTEIN_ mutant allele outcross of _PROTEIN_ heterozygous plants considering the genetic and morphological changes caused by disruption of _PROTEIN_ but the retained ability of _PROTEIN_ homozygous mutant plants to produce normal siliques we examined in vivo pollen tube growth in the stigma and style . wild type pistils were hand pollinated with pollen grains either from wild type or from homozygous _PROTEIN_ plants and stained with aniline blue or h after pollination . four hours after pollination we observed that wild type pollen grains had germinated and that pollen tubes had crossed the stigma and reached the style . after the same period _PROTEIN_ mutant pollen grains had also germinated however pollen tubes were shorter and had not elongated beyond the stigmatic tissue . these differences were more striking h after pollination . at this time wild type pollen tubes had reached the base of the transmitting tract while _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes were only halfway through the transmitting tract requiring h to reach the base . in vivo differences in pollen tube growth rates between the wild type and mutant pollen of a heterozygote can be further evidenced by a nonrandom distribution of mutant seeds within the resulting siliques . therefore a top to bottom comparison was performed on siliques harvested from an outcross with heterozygous pollen . in this population a significantly higher proportion of mutant heterozygotes arose from seeds in the top half of the siliques compared with the bottom half . these results suggest that there is a competitive disadvantage of _PROTEIN_ mutant pollen due at least in part to a slower pollen tube growth rate compared to wild type pollen . however the _PROTEIN_ mutation does not seem to affect other processes of fertilization since _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes reach the ovules and subsequently accomplish fertilization . these data are consistent with the observation that _PROTEIN_ homozygous plants produce a complete seed set with the partial transmission defect of the _PROTEIN_ allele . the observation that mutant pollen was able to germinate when applied directly to the stigma and to achieve fertilization suggests that the female tissue attenuates the _PROTEIN_ in vitro phenotype . using the same t dna insertion line citation showed that the stomata phenotype they observed could be reverted by the addition of _LOCATION_ ptdins . we thus investigated whether the same treatment could rescue the pollen tube mutant phenotype . for this purpose we germinated _PROTEIN_ pollen grains in medium supplemented with ptdins coupled to a shuttle carrier . to confirm that ptdins was loaded into the cells a _METHOD_ version of this hydrophobic formulation was used . observations h after sowing revealed that _LOCATION_ ptdins had no significant effect on wild type pollen tubes . however both the pollen germination percentage and the pollen tube growth rate of _PROTEIN_ cells was restored to values that were not significantly different from those of the wild type control . furthermore _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes loaded with ptdins did not show abnormal morphologies _PROTEIN_ and a blind test analysis could not distinguish between wild type and _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes supplemented with ptdins . _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ associated protein and _PROTEIN_ mutant pollen tubes grown in vitro show morphological patterns consistent with perturbations in _LOCATION_ secretion and recycling _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to investigate this phenomenon we employed the _METHOD_ probe . this dye has been found to be increasingly useful in exploring the endo and exocytosis _METHOD_ in a variety of biological models including pollen tubes . is a nontoxic water soluble dye virtually _METHOD_ in aqueous medium and is believed to insert into the outer leaflet of the surface _LOCATION_ where it becomes _METHOD_ . since the dye stains _LOCATION_ in an activity dependent manner it has proven useful for studies of vesicle recycling exocytosis and endocytosis . confocal imaging of growing arabidopsis wild type pollen tubes labeled with the styryl dye for to min revealed a _METHOD_ staining similar to what had been reported for pollen of other species with a stronger signal in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and an intracellular apical gradient indicative of higher vesicle density in this region . by contrast _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes imaged under the same acquisition settings had a weaker signal both in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and intracellularly . the apical _METHOD_ gradient was partially dissipated and in cells exhibiting loss of _PROTEIN_ and/or branched like growth it was not detectable . a detailed analysis of the intracellular and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ ratios in the apical and subapical regions further revealed that _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes mostly differ from the wild type in the amount of internalized dye . the significance of the data presented was confirmed by the t test . these observations suggest that disruption of _PROTEIN_ inhibits proper endocytosis and _LOCATION_ recycling which may account for the morphological disturbances exhibited by _PROTEIN_ mutant pollen tubes . the subcellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein was investigated using a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ c terminal fusion construct containing the complete open reading frame of the _PROTEIN_ gene . the cdnas were cloned downstream of the promoter . wild type arabidopsis plants were stably transformed either with _METHOD_ or with a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct and pollen tubes _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins were imaged using confocal laser microscopy . control pollen tubes _PROTEIN_ free _METHOD_ showed a uniform distribution of _METHOD_ throughout the cytoplasm . by contrast the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in pollen tubes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and a higher signal was observed at the flanks of the pollen tube tip . although this localization pattern is consistent with a role of _PROTEIN_ in pollen tip growth the signal exhibited by arabidopsis pollen tubes was weak . furthermore these cells grow at a slow rate and are very sensitive to laser irradiation . this prevented collection of time course series of growing cells to confidently establish the localization of _PROTEIN_ . as an alternative we transiently transformed tobacco pollen with the same _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs . this strategy had already been successfully used in previous works . tobacco pollen is easily transformed using biolistics the tubes grow faster than those from arabidopsis and they are larger and more tolerant to the laser irradiation required for imaging . when the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein was _PROTEIN_ at lower levels its subcellular localization in tobacco pollen tubes was similar to that observed in arabidopsis . in actively growing cells the protein seemed to localize mostly at the flanks of the apical region . however when pollen tubes slowed down or ceased to grow _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was also visible at the extreme apex of pollen tubes correlating growth rate with protein localization . overexpression of higher levels of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ led to a significantly higher amount of protein associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and often the apical region of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ exhibited the most intense _METHOD_ signal . this was concomitant with perturbations of _PROTEIN_ growth similar to those observed in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ depleted pollen tubes including partial loss of _PROTEIN_ apical cell wall _PROTEIN_ and inconsistent tube diameter . equivalent phenotypes were observed in pollen tubes cotransformed with separate _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ constructs thus indicating that fusing _PROTEIN_ to _METHOD_ did not affect its function . to further investigate _LOCATION_ secretion and recycling in tobacco pollen tubes pollen tubes overexpressing high levels of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein were loaded with and imaged in dual detection mode . was used instead of to prevent the _METHOD_ spectrum from overlapping with that of _METHOD_ . as previously shown and generate similar data in confocal imaging . in growing nontransformed pollen tubes reveals a strong _LOCATION_ signal and an apical gradient . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to diminish dye uptake and to cause dissipation of the apical gradient suggesting that regulation of ptdins levels by _PROTEIN_ is essential for normal growth and _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . in support of this hypothesis we found that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ also modifies the apical localization of ptdins _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . however these data must be critically interpreted due to possible cytotoxic effects in cotransformation experiments .
