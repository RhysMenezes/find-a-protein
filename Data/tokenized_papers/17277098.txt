negative feedback is a fundamental mechanism of _METHOD_ to _PROTEIN_ the internal environment within tolerable limits . gibberellins are essential regulators of many aspects of plant development including seed germination stem elongation and flowering . ga biosynthesis is regulated by the feedback mechanism in plants . ga oxidase _PROTEIN_ catalyzes the final step of the biosynthetic pathway to produce the physiologically active gas . here we found that only the _PROTEIN_ among the family of arabidopsis is under the regulation of ga negative feedback . we have identified a cis acting sequence responsible for the ga negative feedback of _PROTEIN_ using transgenic plants . furthermore we have identified an _PROTEIN_ hook protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as a dna binding protein for the cis acting sequence of ga negative feedback . the mutation in the cis acting sequence abolished both ga negative feedback and _PROTEIN_ binding . in addition constitutive _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ affected ga negative feedback in arabidopsis . our results suggest that _PROTEIN_ plays a role in the homeostasis of gas through binding to the cis acting sequence of the ga negative feedback of _PROTEIN_ .
the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ gene family consists of four members . _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ and _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ have been demonstrated to encode active _PROTEIN_ . although the enzymatic activity of _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ and _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ was not examined these genes were _PROTEIN_ as members of the _PROTEIN_ family because of their high similarities to _PROTEIN_ . recent work suggested that _PROTEIN_ and are responsible for vegetative growth however they are dispensable for reproductive development . to obtain a further insight into the role of each gene of this family in ga homeostasis we investigated which of the members of family are regulated by feedback mechanism by reverse transcription pcr and dna gel blot hybridization . first we tried to determine where each is _PROTEIN_ . figure shows that _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in seedlings leaves _METHOD_ floral tips and flowers . the mrna for _PROTEIN_ was highly _PROTEIN_ in seedlings but was barely detectable in other tissues as reported previously . _PROTEIN_ mrna was detected in floral tips and slightly in flowers . _PROTEIN_ mrna was detected only in flowers among examined organs . these results indicated that _PROTEIN_ is a major supplier of _PROTEIN_ enzymatic activity in any developmental stage . based on the _PROTEIN_ pattern we next examined in seedlings and flowers the effects of applying ga or an inhibitor for ga biosynthesis uniconazole p. the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was regulated in a ga negative feedback manner in both seedlings and flowers as reported previously . however the _PROTEIN_ of the other three genes was not affected by the treatment with ga or uniconazole p . these results suggested that _PROTEIN_ plays a central role in the homeostasis of ga levels in plants . thus we focused on _PROTEIN_ to identify the molecular _METHOD_ involved in the transcriptional regulation of ga negative feedback . to define the cis acting elements responsible for the ga negative feedback of _PROTEIN_ we generated transgenic arabidopsis plants carrying a series of deletions of the _PROTEIN_ promoter fused to a _PROTEIN_ reporter gene . we examined the effect of applying an inhibitor for ga biosynthesis uniconazole p or ga to the transgenic plants . uniconazole p increased gus activity whereas ga _PROTEIN_ it for the construct showing that the fusion gene was under the control of ga negative feedback . although deletion of bp from to resulted in a _PROTEIN_ of gus activity the feedback regulation was clearly preserved . deletion of bp from to resulted in loss of ga negative feedback . conversely the _PROTEIN_ of was induced by ga . therefore there should be a cis element responsible for ga negative feedback between and in the _PROTEIN_ promoter . to examine the function of the bp sequence between and in the feedback regulation of ga we carried out a gain of function experiment . five tandem copies of the bp dna fragment of the _PROTEIN_ promoter were cloned upstream of a minimal promoter gus . the bp dna fragment endowed the reporter with a remarkable property of feedback regulation suggesting that the sequences are sufficient for ga negative feedback . to further define cis elements for the ga negative feedback of the _PROTEIN_ promoter deletion analysis of the bp sequence between and was performed . deletion of bp from to resulted in loss of the feedback regulation by ga . consistently and were not under the control of ga negative feedback . the _PROTEIN_ of was induced by ga so was that of . one possible explanation of this observation is that a ga responsive element might exist downstream of in the _PROTEIN_ promoter and be suppressed by the sequence upstream of . furthermore addition of the bp sequence from to into recovered the ga negative feedback . these results substantiate the importance of the bp sequence in the feedback regulation of ga . in summary our results show that the bp sequence between and is sufficient for ga negative feedback and that the bp sequence from to is indispensable . we named the bp sequence _PROTEIN_ and focused on the trans acting _PROTEIN_ that binds to it . to identify transcription _PROTEIN_ that bind directly to _PROTEIN_ we performed a yeast one hybrid screen using _PROTEIN_ as bait on the arabidopsis cdna library . screening of transformants yielded two clones . a sequencing and database search revealed that both clones contained an _PROTEIN_ hook motif . our cdna clones represented two distinct genes _GENE_ and . we isolated the cdna clones of _GENE_ and and confirmed the binding of the proteins to _PROTEIN_ in a yeast one hybrid assay . we named these proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was chosen for further analysis . an _PROTEIN_ hook motif and a conserved domain _PROTEIN_ are found in the central part of this family of proteins . unlike _PROTEIN_ proteins that contain three or four repeats of the _PROTEIN_ hook motif _PROTEIN_ has only a single _PROTEIN_ hook motif . _PROTEIN_ belongs to a gene family consisting of members in arabidopsis . the family members break into two major evolutionary clades in the phylogenetic analysis . a _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ of arabidopsis belongs to a distinct clade from that containing _PROTEIN_ . to confirm the specific binding of _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ a gel retardation assay was performed . _PROTEIN_ protein prepared by in vitro translation formed a specific complex with a labeled _PROTEIN_ fragment . six copies of the aaat sequence were found in _PROTEIN_ . because it has been shown that the _PROTEIN_ hook motif binds to an _PROTEIN_ rich sequence the repeat of the aaat sequence could be the target of _PROTEIN_ . to determine the nucleotides that are important for binding to _PROTEIN_ we tested mutant variants of the _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ binding in gel shift assays . mutations in repeats and or in repeats and resulted in only a slight reduction of _PROTEIN_ binding however mutations in repeats and diminished the ability to interact with _PROTEIN_ . furthermore the formation of a complex of wild type _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ was not inhibited in the presence of an excess amount of the mutated sequence . these results indicate that aaat sequences in the central region of _PROTEIN_ are important for _PROTEIN_ binding whereas adjacent repeats are dispensable for the binding . we examined the transcriptional activity of _PROTEIN_ in yeasts . _PROTEIN_ itself as well as a fusion protein of _PROTEIN_ with the activation domain activated the transcription of _PROTEIN_ in the yeast one hybrid assay indicating that _PROTEIN_ is a transcriptional activator at least in yeasts . to determine whether in vitro binding of _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ is consistent with in vivo ga negative feedback we constructed a mutant version of the _PROTEIN_ promoter gus in which the mutation corresponding to was introduced to eliminate the ability to bind with _PROTEIN_ . as expected mutation abolished the transcriptional regulation of the ga negative feedback of the _PROTEIN_ promoter in the transgenic arabidopsis plants . this loss of function experiment showed that the aaat sequences in the central region of _PROTEIN_ are necessary for both ga negative feedback and _PROTEIN_ binding suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is involved in the feedback regulation of _PROTEIN_ through binding to _PROTEIN_ . to examine whether mutation affected the spatial _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ we compared the patterns of gus staining in transgenic plants carrying the wild type construct with those of the mutant version . histochemical analysis indicated that the wild type _PROTEIN_ gus reporter gene was _PROTEIN_ in hypocotyls cotyledons petioles and shoot apices . however the mutant version was not _PROTEIN_ in the shoot apices . these observations suggest that _PROTEIN_ binding to _PROTEIN_ participates in ga negative feedback as well as in the control of _PROTEIN_ in the shoot apices of _PROTEIN_ . we also examined whether the _PROTEIN_ of ga levels alters the pattern of the tissue specific _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ or simply elevates the levels of _PROTEIN_ in those same tissues . the application of uniconazole p elevated the _PROTEIN_ mrna levels in organ regions and tissues that normally _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ pattern of the mutant version was not affected by uniconazole p . our results show that _PROTEIN_ was regulated in a tissue specific manner and this regulation was _PROTEIN_ even when the endogenous ga levels _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ gus in normal conditions was independently reported . although they observed strong staining in roots we detected only weak gus activities in roots . this discrepancy might be reflecting the promoter length of the gus fusion genes we used kb of upstream region while they used kb . in other organs both observations were similar . the _PROTEIN_ pattern of the _PROTEIN_ gene was investigated by rt pcr analysis with total rnas isolated from arabidopsis plants . the mrnas for _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ in seedlings leaves _METHOD_ floral tips and flowers . we next investigated whether the transcription of the _PROTEIN_ gene is regulated by the ga levels . figure shows that the _PROTEIN_ mrna levels were not affected by the treatment with either ga or uniconazole p. this result suggests that the function of _PROTEIN_ is regulated at the posttranscriptional and/or posttranslational levels . rsg _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is a tobacco transcriptional activator with a basic leu zipper domain that is involved in the regulation of endogenous amounts of gas . the intracellular localization of rsg is regulated by the endogenous amounts of gas . we examined the intracellular localization of _PROTEIN_ using transgenic arabidopsis plants in which the fusion gene of _PROTEIN_ and green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ under the control of the promoter of the cauliflower mosaic virus . consistent with the observation that _PROTEIN_ is a dna binding protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized exclusively in the _LOCATION_ in the epidermal cells of petioles in transgenic plants . next we examined the effects of applying ga or an inhibitor for ga biosynthesis uniconazole p to transgenic plants in which _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ . figure shows that the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was not affected by the treatment with either ga or uniconazole p. these results suggest that the function of _PROTEIN_ is regulated by _METHOD_ other than the control of intracellular localization . to confirm the function of _PROTEIN_ in the ga negative feedback we generated transgenic arabidopsis constitutively _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . because the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ constitutive _PROTEIN_ in d old seedlings was comparable to that of the wild type _PROTEIN_ did not seem to be a general enhancer of _PROTEIN_ . but the feedback up regulation of _PROTEIN_ by uniconazole p application was enhanced in _PROTEIN_ constitutive _PROTEIN_ . if _PROTEIN_ plays a role as a transcriptional activator in response to _PROTEIN_ of ga levels constitutive _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ should suppress the transcriptional repression of _PROTEIN_ by ga. ga application after uniconazole p treatment immediately repressed the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in wild type to at min and at min . however this feedback repression was attenuated in _PROTEIN_ constitutive _PROTEIN_ i.e . the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ at at min and at min . because _PROTEIN_ constitutive _PROTEIN_ conferred both hyper up regulation of _PROTEIN_ by reduction of ga levels and resistance to down regulation of _PROTEIN_ by excess ga _PROTEIN_ may be a transcriptional activator specific to ga negative feedback .
