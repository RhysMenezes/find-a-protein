_LOCATION_ are metabolically diverse organelles with essential roles in plant development . the major protein constituents of plant _LOCATION_ are well characterized whereas only a few low abundance and regulatory proteins have been reported to date . we performed an in depth proteome analysis of arabidopsis leaf _LOCATION_ using one dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by liquid chromatography and tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . we detected established plant peroxisomal proteins proteins whose association with arabidopsis _LOCATION_ had been previously demonstrated only by proteomic data and putative novel proteins of _LOCATION_ . we subsequently tested the subcellular targeting of yellow _METHOD_ protein fusions for selected proteins and confirmed the peroxisomal localization for proteins containing predicted _LOCATION_ targeting signals type or _PROTEIN_ three proteins carrying _PROTEIN_ related peptides and four proteins that lack conventional targeting signals . we thereby established the tripeptides slm > and skv > as new _PROTEIN_ and the nonapeptide as a putative new _PROTEIN_ . the peroxisomal proteins conclusively identified from this study potentially carry out novel metabolic and regulatory functions of _LOCATION_ . thus this study represents an important step toward defining the complete plant peroxisomal proteome .
we isolated _LOCATION_ from week old arabidopsis leaves using a previously established method . to gain deeper insights into peroxisomal functions and identify low abundance proteins we used immunoblotting and silver stained protein gel analysis to assess the purity of isolated leaf _LOCATION_ followed by a de liquid chromatography and tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ strategy for protein identification . mitochondria and chloroplasts are known to partially copurify with leaf _LOCATION_ . the detection of _LOCATION_ proteins by available polyclonal antisera _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was below detection limits when analytical protein quantities were used . mitochondrial contamination however could be detected by immunoblotting using a monoclonal antiserum against the kd voltage dependent anion selective channel protein from maize . in addition the intensity of the arabidopsis vdac band correlated with the abundance of a kd protein band on silver stained analytical _PROTEIN_ gels among different _LOCATION_ isolates . the size of the protein indicated its identity as the p subunit of the mitochondrial gly decarboxylase a major protein of leaf mitochondria . using both immunoblotting and silver staining of protein gels as selection criteria we identified three of approximately preparations as leaf _LOCATION_ isolates of highest purity and pooled these samples for subsequent proteome analysis . to increase the chance of discovering low abundance proteins in the sample we separated a large amount of peroxisomal proteins on a d gel and cut the gel lane into slices after electrophoresis . proteins in each gel slice were in gel digested by trypsin the resulting peptide mixtures were subjected to lc electrospray ionization _METHOD_ . proteins were judged to be present in the sample if they had a probability of being correctly identified as assigned by proteinprophet . we identified proteins among which had at least two matching peptides and were detected by probability . sixty five proteins are referred to in this study as established peroxisomal proteins because they have been functionally characterized from at least one plant species . except for seven proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ we identified most _PROTEIN_ proteins that had been functionally characterized in plant _LOCATION_ . the coverage of established peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ proteins in this study is quite high compared with previous proteome analyses of plant _LOCATION_ . the coverage of _LOCATION_ proteins in this study was also improved over a former study of leaf _LOCATION_ . for example all five members of the plant _PROTEIN_ family _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of _LOCATION_ proliferation promoters the _LOCATION_ biogenesis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ two known metabolite transporters _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were identified . four of these established peroxisomal proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were identified for the first time in a proteomic study of plant _LOCATION_ . putative novel proteins of arabidopsis leaf _LOCATION_ identified by d lc _METHOD_ and classified into functional groups listed are proteins among which had also been independently identified by previous proteome analyses but had not been confirmed to be peroxisomal by alternative methods . functional categories to refer to oxidation ros metabolism other metabolic enzymes nucleotide and _LOCATION_ acid metabolism chaperones and proteases and other proteins respectively . _PROTEIN_ in parentheses such as _PROTEIN_ for _GENE_ indicate _PROTEIN_ related peptides skv > in _GENE_ and slm > in _GENE_ were _PROTEIN_ proven to be functional _PROTEIN_ in this study . detailed biophysical and _METHOD_ data on all these proteins are provided in supplemental table . citation citation citation chpt chloroplast cyt _LOCATION_ nuc _LOCATION_ perox _LOCATION_ pm _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ n.d. not determined . we also identified additional proteins whose peroxisomal association had been demonstrated previously only by proteome data and remained to be verified by an independent line of evidence . twenty two of these proteins had first been identified by citation which included for instance nearly all of those with a proven or predicted role in pathogen and herbivore defense _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ further supporting their putative peroxisomal associations . eleven additional proteins first associated with _LOCATION_ by citation were already confirmed to be peroxisomal by a subcellular targeting study of _METHOD_ fusion proteins and are now listed in the group of established plant peroxisomal proteins . eight of the proteins were independently identified by citation zndh _PROTEIN_ mcd inda cuao _PROTEIN_ and pm or citation . protein levels within a subcellular compartment can span a wide dynamic range . to compare the abundance of proteins discovered from our shotgun proteomic experiment we calculated normalized spectral abundance _PROTEIN_ . specifically a spectral abundance _PROTEIN_ for each protein was first determined by dividing the spectral counts of peptides assigned to this protein by the protein length . then each saf was divided by the sum of safs from all proteins in the sample to generate the nsaf value . in this study all of those proteins detected by high nsaf values between and are established peroxisomal proteins reflecting the predominance of photorespiratory and reactive oxygen species metabolism related enzymes in leaf _LOCATION_ . on average the established peroxisomal proteins were identified by relatively high nsaf values whereas nsaf values for proteins that had been assigned to _LOCATION_ only by proteome data were about fold lower . these data suggest that previous proteome studies allowed the identification of proteins whose abundance is order of magnitude lower than that of most _PROTEIN_ enzymes identified by biochemical and genetic methods . however given that we only performed a single proteomic experiment and that some limitations are associated with this quantification method the nsaf based data presented here only serve as a semiquantitative and tentative indication of protein abundance . in addition to the peroxisomal proteins mentioned above the higher sensitivity of our approach allowed the identification of a significant number of putative novel peroxisomal proteins . however this achievement was inevitably accompanied by an increased identification rate of proteins from chloroplasts and mitochondria thus making the annotation of putative novel proteins of leaf _LOCATION_ more difficult . to differentiate between nonperoxisomal and putative novel peroxisomal proteins we took advantage of the large number of organellar proteome studies published for arabidopsis mitochondria and chloroplasts summarized in the arabidopsis subcellular proteomic database . we classified proteins rather stringently as nonperoxisomal contaminants if they were identified from at least two organelle specific proteome studies or are known to be major constituents of other compartments _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or proteasomes . the quantity of chloroplastic and mitochondrial proteins based on their nsaf values was and respectively . eukaryotic ribosomal proteins and a few _LOCATION_ proteins represented and respectively of the total nsaf values likely reflecting the association in biogenesis between _LOCATION_ and the rough _LOCATION_ . we also detected a few of the most abundant proteins from other subcellular compartments including five _LOCATION_ three _LOCATION_ one _LOCATION_ and three from proteasomes . based on the above analyses we concluded that proteins have a strong probability for peroxisomal localization thus we referred to these proteins as putative novel proteins of leaf _LOCATION_ . since the prediction of protein targeting to _LOCATION_ is not available at the arabidopsis information resource most of these proteins were tentatively annotated as being _LOCATION_ by tair for lacking identifiable organelle targeting signals . in contrast to the highly to moderately abundant proteins identified previously in leaf _LOCATION_ most putative novel proteins of plant _LOCATION_ detected for the first time in this study are of low abundance with an average nsaf value of . forty eight of these proteins were identified with high confidence and had at least two matching peptides for each protein . to verify the reliability of protein identification below the high confidence threshold five of nine proteins identified by one matching peptide and/or x probability _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were also chosen and subjected to subsequent in vivo targeting analysis . nine of the putative novel proteins carry predicted plant _PROTEIN_ peptides defined previously seven contain _PROTEIN_ related sequences such as _PROTEIN_ > sll > sqv > slm > and and lack recognizable _PROTEIN_ . based on annotation sequence homology and predicted function we classified the putative novel proteins into several categories oxidation ros metabolism other metabolic enzymes nucleotide and _LOCATION_ acid metabolism chaperones and proteases and other proteins such as those with unknown functions . a major functional group is composed of seven proteins with predicted auxiliary functions in fatty acid oxidation four of which carry predicted _PROTEIN_ . our study identified two additional members of the functionally uncharacterized family of small thioesterases . the predicted _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ for was previously shown to be highly conserved in homologous genomic sequences and plant ests . homologs of hydroxyacid oxidase isoform _PROTEIN_ and esterase/lipase/thioesterase family isoform in all or some of the plant lineages examined carry well known major or minor _PROTEIN_ tripeptides or _PROTEIN_ related sequences such as crm > and sll > supporting the localization of these proteins in _LOCATION_ and indicating the conserved function for these proteins in peroxisomal metabolism across a wide range of plant species . enzymes with annotated functions related to ros metabolism include four glutathione s transferases _PROTEIN_ that belong to the u and f subfamilies _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . dehydroascorbate reductase _PROTEIN_ is probably the last missing protein of the peroxisomal ascorbate glutathione cycle catalyzed by four _PROTEIN_ targeted or _LOCATION_ associated enzymes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . peroxisomal dhar had been characterized biochemically in pea _LOCATION_ but the corresponding cdna had not been cloned from any plant species . additional metabolic enzymes that are not obviously oxidation related include a thiol methyltransferase a dephospho coa kinase homolog _PROTEIN_ udp xyl synthase _PROTEIN_ nucleoside diphosphate kinase type _PROTEIN_ a catalytic/coenzyme binding protein and a quinone reductase _PROTEIN_ three of these six proteins carry c terminal _PROTEIN_ related tripeptides _PROTEIN_ > _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ > and _PROTEIN_ > . in fulfillment of our intention to identify regulatory proteins more than of the putative novel proteins can be categorized as nonmetabolic proteins that most likely have regulatory roles in metabolism signal transduction or protein processing . three proteins are likely involved in protein/peptide processing or turnover . lon protease homolog _PROTEIN_ is orthologous to proteases from mammalian and yeast _LOCATION_ and carries a conserved _PROTEIN_ . the ser type endopeptidase has been detected in recent _LOCATION_ proteome studies . however we classified this protein as a putative dual targeted novel protein of _LOCATION_ due to its c terminal _PROTEIN_ related peptide sll > and the accumulation of upstream basic residues . we also detected specific homologs of arabidopsis chaperone families including members of the heat shock protein _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ families and three cyclophilin homologs . the copper homeostasis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is a putative copper chaperone with the c terminal _PROTEIN_ related tripeptide sqv > . in the category of nucleotide and _LOCATION_ acid metabolism we uncovered two _METHOD_ of the gly rich rna binding family of proteins _PROTEIN_ that added to the two _PROTEIN_ previously identified by citation an rna and export _PROTEIN_ binding protein and a putative _LOCATION_ rna binding protein . in addition to the previously identified nucleotide binding protein nbp which is now annotated as a member of the his triad protein family two additional hit family members _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were identified from this study . _PROTEIN_ carries a predicted and conserved _PROTEIN_ nonapeptide and _PROTEIN_ contains an n terminal _PROTEIN_ like nonapeptide that is also conserved among its homologs in other plant species . hit proteins constitute a superfamily of nucleotide binding and hydrolyzing enzymes . arabidopsis contains five hit domain containing proteins none of which has been functionally characterized . additional proteins with predicted regulatory functions include an acid phosphatase class b homolog four _METHOD_ of the protein family of phosphorylated protein binding _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ two thioredoxin homologs two _PROTEIN_ binding proteins and a second homolog of the peroxisomal acetyl transferase _PROTEIN_ . furthermore a gibberellin responsive protein homolog a cold regulated protein a putative cytochrome homolog and a senescence associated protein _PROTEIN_ were also assigned to this group . homologs of actin and tubulin were also detected but were not associated with specific gene models due to high sequence identity among the paralogs . lastly a few proteins lacking functional annotations are referred to as unknown proteins among which three proteins carry predicted _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ related tripeptides . contrary to _PROTEIN_ conservation in and _PROTEIN_ homologs across diverse plant families _LOCATION_ targeting of may be restricted to the brassicaceae . to validate peroxisomal targeting of the putative novel proteins identified in this proteome analysis we tested the subcellular localization of a subset of these proteins utilizing in vivo targeting analysis of _METHOD_ fusions . during the course of this work _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were independently confirmed by alternative methods to be _LOCATION_ targeted and therefore were excluded from further analysis . we divided the proteins into three categories based on the detection of predicted _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ related peptides or no recognizable _PROTEIN_ in these proteins and focused on representatives from each category . subcellular targeting results for selected proteins identified from this proteomic study chpt chloroplast cyt _LOCATION_ perox _LOCATION_ nuc _LOCATION_ pm _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ transmembrane domains . numbers in parentheses are probabilities for the prediction of respective transmembrane domains by the plant _LOCATION_ protein database aramemnon values greater than were considered to be positive . the first group contained all seven putative novel proteins with predicted _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as well as eight _PROTEIN_ containing proteins also identified independently by citation _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mcd zndh cuao inda and p or citation but whose peroxisomal localization had not been verified by alternative means . in _PROTEIN_ these eight proteins are also highly likely to be peroxisomal because their homologs in some or all other plant species contain _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ related sequences . the second group included four putative novel proteins with c terminal _PROTEIN_ related sequences or n terminal _PROTEIN_ related sequences namely the putative copper chaperone _PROTEIN_ a putative coenzyme binding protein _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . we also added to this group _PROTEIN_ another his triad family protein besides _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ because this protein had been identified previously through proteomics but had not been confirmed for its peroxisomal localization by alternative methods . the third group consisted of putative novel proteins lacking predicted _PROTEIN_ most of which have annotated functions not associated with _LOCATION_ previously . for medium throughput cloning of candidate genes we first created two gateway compatible destination vectors for fusion of the coding regions of candidate cdnas to the n terminus _PROTEIN_ or the c terminus _PROTEIN_ of the enhanced _METHOD_ and for driving gene _PROTEIN_ by the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . genes encoding proteins without predicted _PROTEIN_ were cloned into both vectors or first into the vector for _PROTEIN_ containing proteins because _PROTEIN_ related sequences are more difficult to detect than _PROTEIN_ like sequences . we were unable to clone _PROTEIN_ p and _PROTEIN_ into destination vectors . as a result _METHOD_ fusions for genes were transiently coexpressed with the peroxisomal marker gene _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaves . subcellular protein targeting was analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy _PROTEIN_ to d after agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated infiltration of the constructs . all proteins with predicted _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ peptides were verified to be targeted to _LOCATION_ largely with one on one colocalization between their _METHOD_ fusions and the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ marker . notably seven of these proteins _PROTEIN_ have annotated functions in lipid metabolism . peroxisomal targeting for three of the five proteins with _PROTEIN_ relative peptides was also confirmed . of the four proteins with _PROTEIN_ related sequences _PROTEIN_ and localized to _LOCATION_ whereas _PROTEIN_ and _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ were found to localize to the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ respectively . _LOCATION_ targeting of _PROTEIN_ and suggested that skv > and slm > may be new _PROTEIN_ tripeptides . to further test this hypothesis we analyzed the localization of two fusion proteins lacking the respective tripeptides . as expected the truncated proteins failed to target to _LOCATION_ . we also examined the subcellular localization of _METHOD_ with skv > or slm > fused to its c terminus _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and observed strong colocalization of the respective fusion proteins with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in both cases targeting to the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ was also observed . besides and _PROTEIN_ the arabidopsis genome contains more proteins terminating with slm > and additional proteins containing c terminal skv > these proteins thereby emerge as putative peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ proteins . collectively our results identified both skv > and slm > as new _PROTEIN_ tripeptides and suggested that some arabidopsis proteins containing these two tripeptides may potentially target to the _LOCATION_ as well . _PROTEIN_ which has a _PROTEIN_ related nonapeptide in its n terminal domain targeted to spherical structures labeled by _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . interestingly this protein _METHOD_ to be dual targeted as reticulate structures mostly surrounding the chloroplasts were also labeled by yellow _METHOD_ . thus far three of the five arabidopsis hit proteins have been found to be associated with _LOCATION_ revealing the unique involvement of this class of nucleotide hydroxylases/transferases in plant _LOCATION_ functions . we also tested the localization of proteins that lack recognizable _PROTEIN_ . consistent with its predicted involvement in the peroxisomal ascorbate glutathione cycle _PROTEIN_ localized strongly to _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ localized to the periphery of _LOCATION_ suggesting its possible association with the _LOCATION_ of these organelles . _PROTEIN_ a senescence associated small protein of amino acids targeted to _LOCATION_ and led to _LOCATION_ aggregation . this peroxisomal phenotype indicates that _PROTEIN_ may have a role in _LOCATION_ distribution alternatively the phenotype may represent a dominant negative effect caused by attaching the kd _METHOD_ to a small protein . finally _PROTEIN_ was highly enriched in _LOCATION_ paralleled by its weak targeting to the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . these results collectively demonstrated that an increasing number of peroxisomal proteins lacking predicted or closely related _PROTEIN_ tripeptides are being identified . these proteins may be either surface associated with or imported into _LOCATION_ via alternative yet unknown import _METHOD_ . however _LOCATION_ targeting of the remaining proteins lacking obvious _PROTEIN_ related sequences was not supported by our transient _PROTEIN_ assays as they were found to be associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ . these data suggest that some proteins from this group could be contaminants from other compartments and our transient _PROTEIN_ system may have limitations in validating some of the true peroxisomal proteins .
arabidopsis plants were grown for to weeks in a h h dark cycle under to light . rosette leaves were harvested and leaf _LOCATION_ isolated as described previously . protein concentration was determined as described before using bovine serum albumin as a standard . proteins were precipitated by chloroform/methanol and separated on minigels . for immunoblotting we transferred proteins in a semidry system according to standard procedures . arabidopsis vdac was detected by a monoclonal antiserum against the maize vdac followed by anti mouse iggs coupled to horseradish peroxidase and was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence . silver staining of proteins was performed according to citation . based on anti vdac cross reactivity silver staining intensity of the kd p protein band and total protein visible by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ leaf _LOCATION_ isolates were classified into three categories high moderate and low purity . selected leaf _LOCATION_ isolates of high purity were used as internal standards on all subsequent minigels . the proteins of highly pure arabidopsis leaf _LOCATION_ were precipitated dissolved in of sample buffer and loaded onto a single lane of a minigel for electrophoresis . after the protein front ran approximately cm onto the resolving gel the gel was faintly stained by _METHOD_ brilliant blue and cut into slices each of which was _PROTEIN_ digested by trypsin . the extracted peptides were automatically injected by a waters nanoacquity sample manager and loaded for min onto a waters symmetry peptide trap at in formic acid . the bound peptides were then eluted onto a waters beh nanoacquity column and eluted over min with a gradient of b to b in min using a waters nanoacquity uplc system into a thermofisher ltq _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ spectrometer at a flow rate of nl . survey scans were taken in the fourier transformation at resolution at a _METHOD_ to charge ratio of and the top ions in each survey scan were then subjected to automatic low energy collision induced dissociation in the ltq _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ spectrometer . the resulting _METHOD_ spectra were converted to peak lists using bioworks browser version with default parameters and searched using the mascot searching algorithm version against the genome database downloaded from tair . the mascot output was then analyzed using scaffold to probabilistically validate protein identifications using the proteinprophet computer algorithm . protein length normalized nsaf values were calculated according to citation . two destination vectors were created using gateway cloning technology . using the binary vector as a backbone the promoter hexa his and _METHOD_ were sequentially cloned into the vectors . pdest _METHOD_ x was designed for fusion of genes with putative _PROTEIN_ signals to the c terminus of _METHOD_ pdest x _METHOD_ was designed for fusing genes with putative _PROTEIN_ to the n terminus of _METHOD_ . the coding region of a novel peroxisomal gene was pcr amplified from the cdna clone obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center or from total rna of ecotype columbia seedlings . each pcr product was first cloned into a donor vector by the gateway _PROTEIN_ reaction to create an entry clone and _PROTEIN_ into the destination vector by the gateway lr reaction . four week old tobacco plants were used for the agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transient _PROTEIN_ assays . a. tumefaciens strains and containing the plasmid of interest were incubated at overnight washed and resuspended in water to an optical density at nm of . cells transformed with plasmids harboring either a _METHOD_ fusion or the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ peroxisomal marker were mixed and infiltrated into tobacco leaves using ml needleless syringes . leaves of infiltrated plants were analyzed after d by _PROTEIN_ . we used and nm lasers to excite _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and chlorophyll respectively . _METHOD_ was detected using an emission filter of a to nm band pass for _METHOD_ a to nm band pass for _METHOD_ and a nm long pass for chlorophyll . all images were acquired from single optical sections . the following materials are available in the online version of this article . supplemental figure . analysis of _PROTEIN_ conservation in homologous plant ests for some of the peroxisomal proteins identified reproducibly by proteomics in this study . supplemental figure . sequence alignment of small thioesterase homologs . supplemental table . nonperoxisomal proteins identified in arabidopsis leaf _LOCATION_ . supplemental table . sixty five established proteins of plant _LOCATION_ identified in arabidopsis leaf _LOCATION_ by d lc _METHOD_ . supplemental table . detailed biophysical and _METHOD_ data for the proteins listed in table i . supplemental table . arabidopsis proteins terminating with the novel _PROTEIN_ tripeptides slm > and skv > . supplemental document . abbreviations used in this report and plant species _METHOD_ used in figure and supplemental figure .
