_PROTEIN_ is a _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . _PROTEIN_ transiently accumulates in the _LOCATION_ when cells are exposed to hypoosmotic conditions but its physiological relevance is unclear . this is possibly because arabidopsis has approximately close homologs of _PROTEIN_ and they function redundantly . to examine their physiological roles transgenic plants overexpressing a repression domain fused form of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in which the gene activation mediated by _PROTEIN_ is expected to be repressed were generated . because hypoosmotic stress can mimic mechanical stimuli the touch induced root waving phenotypes and gene _PROTEIN_ patterns in those transgenic plants were examined . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants exhibited more severe root waving and lower _PROTEIN_ of putative _PROTEIN_ target genes . the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion protein partially suppressed the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ induced increase in root waving when _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ can suppress the touch induced root waving . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ induced increase in root waving was also suppressed when the synthetic auxin dichlorophenoxy acetic acid or the ethylene precursor aminocyclopropane _PROTEIN_ acid which is known to activate auxin biosynthesis was present in the growth medium . root cap cells with the auxin marker _METHOD_ were more abundant in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ background than in the wild type background . auxin is transported via the root cap and the conditions of outermost root cap layers were abnormal in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants . these results raise the possibility that _PROTEIN_ influences structures of the root cap and thereby regulates the local auxin responses in roots .
in a previous study _PROTEIN_ and two other arabidopsis group i subgroup _PROTEIN_ proteins and _PROTEIN_ exhibited a similar _LOCATION_ cytoplasmic shuttling pattern under a hypoosmotic condition . three more group i subgroup _PROTEIN_ proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ as _METHOD_ fused proteins in arabidopsis to study their subcellular localization . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals as well as the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal were detected _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ and min after the plants were submerged in mm tris hcl ph . the signals were observed in the _LOCATION_ min after the plants were submerged in the same solution . similar results were obtained when a murashige and skoog _METHOD_ liquid medium was used instead of mm tris hcl ph . these proteins also were transiently _PROTEIN_ in lettuce epidermal cells and the intensity of their signals in the _LOCATION_ increased after the cells were treated with mm tris hcl ph . these results further support the idea that the _LOCATION_ localizations of the group i _PROTEIN_ proteins is similarly enhanced by hypoosmotic stress . _PROTEIN_ is one of the putative _PROTEIN_ target genes and its promoter is bound by _PROTEIN_ . the glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ fused _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as well as _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli purified and subjected to a gel shift assay with the _PROTEIN_ promoter fragment as the probe . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ proteins were not _PROTEIN_ in e. coli but the others were _PROTEIN_ at detectable levels and _PROTEIN_ the electrophoretic mobility of the probe in the gel shift assay . this result suggests that these proteins can bind to the _PROTEIN_ promoter in vitro and raises the possibility that they share somewhat similar dna binding abilities . hypoosmotic stress can induce responses similar to those induced by mechanical stimuli such as touch . this led us to examine the roles of _PROTEIN_ and other group i _PROTEIN_ proteins in regulating root waving which is a touch induced response . when plants are grown on tilted impenetrable agar medium their root tips are in continuous contact with the surface of the medium which induces root bending . on the other hand roots influenced by gravity tend to grow in the direction of the gravitational force . the touch induced bending and the gravitropism cause the roots to have a wavy appearance . the extent of root waving can be determined using the vertical growth index which is calculated by dividing the length of the vertical projection of the primary root by the length of the primary root . the vgis of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants were similar to those of the wild type plants . this might be because the group i _PROTEIN_ proteins have functional redundancies which mask the effects of the t dna insertions in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . however some of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines in which gene _PROTEIN_ regulated by _PROTEIN_ and other group i _PROTEIN_ proteins is expected to be disturbed exhibited greater root waving than the wild type plants . eight _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines had lower root vgis than the wild type plants . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ level which reflects the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ level in a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ line was highest in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which had the second lowest vgi followed by which had the lowest vgi . this result supports the idea that the root vgi and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ level are negatively correlated . the overexpression of _PROTEIN_ alone did not result in a _PROTEIN_ in the vgi . no clear differences were observed between wild type and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants _PROTEIN_ responses to either the stress related phytohormone abscisic acid or the hyperosmotic stress induced by mannitol . the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ expansin like _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were examined in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the latter of which has a lower _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and a higher root vgi than . under unstressed conditions the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels were lower in both _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and than in wild type plants and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ level was lower in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ than in wild type plants . following incubation in mm tris hcl ph for min the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ level was lower in both _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and than in wild type plants and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels were lower in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ than in wild type plants . these results support the idea that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ represses the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ target genes . to further characterize the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mediated _PROTEIN_ in the root vgi the lines gox/vrdox and vgox/vrdox which _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ respectively in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ background were generated by crossing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with either a line containing a promoter driven _METHOD_ _METHOD_ or a line containing a promoter driven _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the vgi of gox/vrdox was higher than that of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but lower than that of _METHOD_ . on the other hand the vgi of vgox/vrdox was higher than that of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and as high as those of _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was not lower in either gox/vrdox or vgox/vrdox than in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . similar results were obtained when the line _PROTEIN_ the auxin marker _METHOD_ in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ background was used instead of gox/vrdox . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ suppresses the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mediated _PROTEIN_ in the root vgi . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ level was higher in gox/vrdox than in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but the vgi of gox/vrdox was higher than that of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ and/or some transgenes might somewhat inhibit _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transcription or the functions of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ level was lower in gox/vrdox than in _METHOD_ and the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ level was lower in vgox/vrdox than in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . this may have been due to transgene silencing . consistent with this result western blotting revealed that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ level was lower in vgox/vrdox than in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in the absence of hypoosmotic stress the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals were detected in the _LOCATION_ but not in the _LOCATION_ of cells in wavy roots in either _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or vgox/vrdox suggesting that the touch stress was insufficient to induce a detectable level of _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ localization . no differences were observed between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and vgox/vrdox in the _LOCATION_ cytoplasmic shuttling pattern of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under hypoosmotic conditions suggesting that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ does not affect the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ . ethylene can stimulate auxin biosynthesis and basipetal auxin transport in roots both of which help regulate root _METHOD_ . the ethylene biosynthesis inhibitor aminoethoxyvinylglycine can _PROTEIN_ the endogenous auxin level and auxin responses . consistent with these earlier findings the root vgis of wild type and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants were lower in the presence of avg than in its absence but the extent of the _PROTEIN_ in vgi was greater in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ than in wild type plants . the vgi of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was unaffected by avg but it was lower than that of wild type or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants _PROTEIN_ of the presence of avg . this might be because the _PROTEIN_ in the vgi is saturated in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ even in the absence of avg . the vgis of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and were higher in the presence of either dichlorophenoxy acetic acid or aminocyclopropane _PROTEIN_ acid than their absence . the responses of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and to avg d and acc were similar to those of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . under these conditions no clear difference was observed in root length between the wild type and vip _PROTEIN_ plants . these results support the idea that auxin is involved in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ dependent _PROTEIN_ in the root vgi . to visualize the local auxin responses in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ roots _METHOD_ was introduced into the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ background . _METHOD_ labels cells exhibiting strong auxin responses . the _METHOD_ signals were limited to the columella cells in the root cap in the wild type background but in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ background they were also detected in the _PROTEIN_ root cap cells . to visualize the _PROTEIN_ auxin transporters _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ proteins fused to _METHOD_ using their own promoters were introduced into _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . no differences were observed between the wild type background and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ background _PROTEIN_ either the subcellular localization or the tissue specificity of the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins . no differences were observed in the intensities of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals either . however the intensities of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals were lower and higher respectively in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ background than in the wild type background . in qrt pcr no large differences were observed between wild type and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ of either ethylene biosynthesis genes or auxin related genes including _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . no differences were observed in the _PROTEIN_ of the genes encoding the golven secretory peptides which induce the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ and inhibit gravitropic root growth either . these results suggest that those genes are not _PROTEIN_ target genes . starch grain accumulation in columella cells is necessary for full gravitropic responses of roots but no differences were observed between wild type and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants _PROTEIN_ starch grain accumulation in columella cells . the number of meristematic cells in the root cortex reflects the activity of the root apical meristem but no differences were observed in the abundance of such meristematic cells between wild type and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ affects neither starch accumulation nor the meristem activity in roots . on the other hand a closer examination of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines revealed that their outermost root cap layers were abnormal . in the wavy roots the conditions of the outermost root cap layers were classified into the following three categories i the edges of the layer are being removed from the other root cap parts ii the layer has ruptured in the middle and iii the layer is completely attached to the inner root cap parts . most of the outermost root cap layers in wild type plants belonged to categories i and iii whereas most of the layers in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants belonged to categories ii and iii . this result supports the idea that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ affects the adhesion of the cell layers and/or structures of the root cap . and are _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines . categories and genotypes were not independent according to the test .
