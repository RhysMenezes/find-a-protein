nadh and nadph undergo spontaneous and enzymatic reactions that produce r and s _METHOD_ of nad h hydrates which are not electron donors and inhibit various dehydrogenases . in bacteria yeast and mammals these hydrates are repaired by the tandem action of an adp or _PROTEIN_ dependent dehydratase that converts nad hx to nad h and an epimerase that facilitates interconversion of the r and s _METHOD_ . plants have homologs of both enzymes the epimerase homolog being fused to the vitamin salvage enzyme pyridoxine phosphate oxidase . recombinant maize and arabidopsis nad hx dehydratases _PROTEIN_ were able to reconvert nad hx to nad h in an _PROTEIN_ dependent manner . recombinant maize and arabidopsis epimerases _PROTEIN_ rapidly interconverted and nad hx as did a truncated form of the arabidopsis epimerase lacking the pyridoxine phosphate oxidase domain . all plant nad hx dehydratase and epimerase sequences examined had predicted organellar targeting peptides with a potential second start codon whose use would eliminate the targeting peptide . in vitro transcription/translation assays confirmed that both start sites were used . dual import assays with purified pea chloroplasts and mitochondria and subcellular localization of _METHOD_ fusion constructs in tobacco suspension cells indicated mitochondrial _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ localization of the arabidopsis epimerase and dehydratase . ablation of the arabidopsis dehydratase gene raised seedling levels of all nadhx _METHOD_ by to fold and levels of one nadphx form by to fold . we conclude that plants have a canonical two enzyme nad hx repair system that is directed to three subcellular compartments via the use of alternative translation start sites .
whereas plant nad hx dehydratase homologs are like those of yeast and mammals in being stand alone proteins plant epimerase homologs have an extra c terminal domain that belongs to the pyridoxine/pyridoxamine phosphate oxidase _PROTEIN_ family _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ activities participate in the salvage of vitamin . both activities have been demonstrated in vitro for the _PROTEIN_ domain of the arabidopsis epimerase _PROTEIN_ protein . relative to their prokaryotic homologs plant nad hx dehydratase and epimerase _PROTEIN_ proteins have poorly conserved n terminal extensions that are predicted to be mitochondrial and/or _LOCATION_ targeting sequences . close inspection of these sequences from diverse plants revealed that all have a downstream met residue that if used to initiate translation would remove the targeting signal . the n terminal regions of plant dehydratase and epimerase _PROTEIN_ proteins thus have features suggesting the possibility of triple location in mitochondria _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . arabidopsis and maize dehydratase and epimerase _PROTEIN_ coding sequences each beginning at the second potential start codon were _PROTEIN_ in e. coli as n terminally his tagged proteins purified by affinity chromatography and used to assay enzyme activities . the expected dehydratase and epimerase activities were both tested using a spectrophotometric method in which the conversion of nad hx to nad h is monitored . when a purified equilibrium mixture of and nadhx was incubated with _PROTEIN_ and arabidopsis or maize dehydratase nadh accumulated to a level equivalent to of the total nadhx added to the assay indicating that all nadhx in the mixture had been converted . no nadh formation was detected when adp replaced _PROTEIN_ . subsequent addition of the corresponding epimerase _PROTEIN_ protein to the reaction caused further accumulation of nadh to a level equal to the total nadhx in the assay . this second phase of nadh formation is consistent with epimerase mediated conversion of nadhx to nadhx followed by dehydration of the latter . similar results were obtained for arabidopsis and maize dehydratase and epimerase when a mixture of and nadphx replaced and nadhx . to confirm nad hx dehydration and isomerization directly enzyme reactions were analyzed by hplc . analysis of a mixture of both nadhx epimers before incubation or after incubation without enzymes showed the presence of and nadhx in a ratio . addition of plant dehydratase caused the disappearance of nadhx and the appearance of an equivalent quantity of nadh whereas nadhx was unaffected . adding both plant dehydratase and epimerase caused the disappearance of both nadhx epimers and the appearance of nadh . as expected the dehydratase caused no disappearance of cyclic nad hx . kinetic characterization of arabidopsis and maize dehydratases using the spectrophotometric assay gave km values for nadhx and nadphx of to catalytic constant values of to and kcat/km ratios that indicated a mild preference for nadphx . all of these values are near those for the mammalian and bacterial dehydratases . activities were determined spectrophotometrically at as described in materials and methods. values are means se of three replicates . together the above results establish that plant dehydratases catalyze _PROTEIN_ dependent conversion of nad hx to nad h that the epimerases facilitate conversion of nad hx to nad hx and that their kinetic properties are consistent with their playing these roles in vivo . to test whether the epimerase domain is solely responsible for nad hx epimerase activity the separate domains of the arabidopsis epimerase _PROTEIN_ fusion were _PROTEIN_ in e. coli as n terminally his tagged proteins and purified . when the recombinant domains were incubated with partially purified or nadhx adding the _PROTEIN_ domain did not result in interconversion of and epimers but adding the epimerase domain caused rapid conversion of to nadhx and vice versa until the to nadhx ratio reached the equilibrium value of . this result _METHOD_ that epimerase activity resides in the epimerase domain alone and complements the finding that _PROTEIN_ activity resides in the _PROTEIN_ domain . we first determined which of the potential start sites in the dehydratase and epimerase/ppox are functional in vitro using arabidopsis complementary dnas and a coupled transcription wheat germ translation system . native full length cdnas of both genes gave two translation products whereas cdnas whose second predicted start codon was replaced by leu gave only the larger product and cdnas truncated at the second start codon gave only the smaller one . these results establish that the dehydratase and epimerase both have alternative start sites at least in vitro . to test whether the n terminal regions of the full length dehydratase and epimerase _PROTEIN_ are _LOCATION_ or mitochondrial targeting peptides we performed dual import assays with mixed pea chloroplasts and mitochondria using the full length and truncated t _METHOD_ of the arabidopsis proteins . the wild type full length _METHOD_ of both proteins were not tested because as noted above both of these sequences gave two translation products which could potentially yield ambiguous results . as shown in figure the full length dehydratase was imported and processed by both organelles but the truncated form was not . the full length epimerase _PROTEIN_ was imported and processed by chloroplasts and to a lesser extent by mitochondria but the truncated t form did not enter either organelle . these results indicate that both proteins have the potential for dual targeting to _LOCATION_ and mitochondria as bioinformatically predicted . to explore localization in vivo _METHOD_ microscopy was used to analyze arabidopsis dehydratase and epimerase _PROTEIN_ c terminal _METHOD_ fusions _PROTEIN_ transiently in tobacco suspension cultured cells serving as a well characterized system for studying protein localization in plant cells . three types of fusion constructs were examined for each sequence the wild type full length form which can potentially be translated to yield proteins with or without the putative n terminal targeting peptide the truncated t form which lacks the putative n terminal targeting peptide and the full length form which forces translation of only the full length protein including its putative n terminal targeting peptide . for both the dehydratase and the epimerase the wild type full length and truncated t _METHOD_ appeared to be localized primarily in the _LOCATION_ as evidenced by the diffuse _METHOD_ patterns attributable to these constructs . by contrast cells transformed with the full length versions of both proteins usually exhibited a distinct punctate _METHOD_ pattern identical to that exhibited by the endogenous mitochondrial marker protein cytochrome c oxidase subunit ii in the same cells . notably in a small proportion of cells transformed with the dehydratase or epimerase the proteins appeared to localize not to mitochondria but rather to _LOCATION_ as well as to _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _LOCATION_ targeting of the full length wild type epimerase _PROTEIN_ protein was also reported by citation . overall the in vivo _METHOD_ fusion protein localization results indicate that depending on the translation start site used the dehydratase and epimerase _PROTEIN_ proteins can localize either to the _LOCATION_ and/or to mitochondria or _LOCATION_ . these in vivo results are thus to some extent consistent with the in vitro data . high throughput proteomics data sets provide additional evidence for multisite localization of the plant epimerase _PROTEIN_ protein . thus two independent studies detected the arabidopsis protein in enriched _LOCATION_ fractions and in mitochondria and unpublished experiments from the plant proteome database detected it in the chloroplast stroma . no publicly available proteomics data could be found for the plant dehydratase . two potential nad hx dehydratase knockout lines with transfer dna insertions in exons of _GENE_ were identified from the salk collection and the gabi kat collection . homozygous plants were confirmed to lack detectable nad hx mrna . neither nad hx dehydratase knockout line differed visibly from the wild type parental line when grown under our standard conditions . targeted liquid chromatography _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ metabolomics was used to compare levels of nad hx and of the corresponding pyrimidine nucleotides in d old seedlings of each knockout line with those in the wild type . there were to fold increases in and nadhx and in cyclic nadhx in both knockouts as well as large fold changes in the cyclic form of nadphx . no consistent and significant increases or _PROTEIN_ in nad nadh nadp or nadph were detected in the knockouts relative to the wild type . it should be noted that although the signals for nadhx _METHOD_ were two orders of magnitude greater than those for nadphx _METHOD_ this does not signify that nadhx is more abundant than nadphx because signal strength in lc _METHOD_ is highly dependent on the behavior of molecules in the _METHOD_ spectrometer . these data confirm that the dehydratase functions in vivo to limit the buildup of nad hx .
