a gene named _PROTEIN_ has been identified in arabidopsis thaliana to encode a monofunctional peroxisomal enoyl coa hydratase . homologues of _PROTEIN_ are present in several _METHOD_ belonging to the monocotyledon and dicotyledon classes as well as in a gymnosperm . in vitro enzyme assays demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ catalyzed the reversible conversion of enoyl coa to hydroxyacyl coa . _PROTEIN_ was also demonstrated to have enoyl coa hydratase activity in an in vivo assay relying on the synthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoate from the polymerization of hydroxyacyl coa in the _LOCATION_ of saccharomyces cerevisiae . _PROTEIN_ contained a _LOCATION_ targeting signal at the c terminal end was addressed to the _LOCATION_ in s. cerevisiae and a fusion protein between _PROTEIN_ and a _METHOD_ protein was targeted to _LOCATION_ in onion cells . _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ was strongest in tissues with high oxidation activity such as germinating seedlings and senescing leaves . the contribution of _PROTEIN_ to the degradation of unsaturated fatty acids was assessed by analyzing the _PROTEIN_ flux through the oxidation cycle in plants that synthesize peroxisomal polyhydroxyalkanoate and that were over or underexpressing the _PROTEIN_ gene . these studies revealed that _PROTEIN_ participates in vivo to the conversion of the intermediate hydroxyacyl coa generated by the metabolism of fatty acids with a cis unsaturated bond on an even numbered _PROTEIN_ to the enoyl coa for further degradation through the core oxidation cycle .
identification of a candidate gene encoding an enoyl coa using the blastp program available on the arabidopsis information resource for a. thaliana proteins showing significant similarity to the enoyl coa hydratase domain of the mfe of human and of s. cerevisiae revealed only one protein encoded by the gene _GENE_ . this protein named _PROTEIN_ showed and amino acid identity to the enoyl coa hydratase domain of the mfe of human and s. cerevisiae and the monofunctional enoyl coa hydratase from pseudomonas aeruginosa respectively . _PROTEIN_ was predicted to encode a protein of amino acids with a pi of and an estimated molecular _METHOD_ of kda . fig . presents the alignment of _PROTEIN_ with the monofunctional enoyl coa hydratase from a. punctata and p. aeruginosa and the hydratase domain of the mfe from human s. cerevisiae and candida tropicalis . multiple sequence alignment of eukaryotic enoyl coa hydratase has previously revealed a conserved region showing a motif gdx np called the hydratase motif . this motif was found in _PROTEIN_ between amino acids and . crystallization of the enoyl coa hydratase domain of the c. tropicalis mfe identified four amino acids interacting with the coa moiety that are highly conserved among eukaryotic hydratase as well as five amino acids forming the active site . all these nine amino acids were conserved in the _PROTEIN_ . another notable feature of _PROTEIN_ is the c terminal tripeptide ser ser leu . although this terminal tripeptide was not considered as a peroxisomal targeting signal in targeting prediction _METHOD_ a recent study aimed at identifying plant peroxisomal targeting signals described ser ser leu as a minor peroxisomal targeting signal . _PROTEIN_ protein sequence was used to identify putative enoyl coa hydratase in various plant species . alignment of these plant enoyl coa hydratase is shown in fig . . there is a high degree of conservation found throughout the proteins for _PROTEIN_ of plants belonging to the monocotyledon and dicotyledons classes as well as in one member of the coniferophyta division . all residues forming the catalytic sites were conserved and of the four conserved residues interacting with the coa moiety only the aromatic amino acid phe of _PROTEIN_ was replaced in various plants by the aromatic amino acid tyr . plant enoyl coa hydratase showed predominance for the c terminal tripeptide ser ser leu whereas the pine homologous protein ended with the tripeptide ser ala leu . localization of _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ assess the peroxisomal addressing of _PROTEIN_ a fusion protein between an _METHOD_ at the n terminus and _PROTEIN_ at the c terminus was constructed and _PROTEIN_ under the control of a double cauliflower mosaic virus s viral promoter to allow transient _PROTEIN_ of the fusion protein in onion cells following biolistic bombardment . as a control a second plasmid carrying a fusion gene between an enhanced cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and the peroxisomal malate dehydrogenase from cucumber _PROTEIN_ was used . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ gene constructs were transformed together in onion epidermal cells and the _METHOD_ was examined by confocal microscopy after h. control experiments have determined that _METHOD_ of the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ could be detected without cross interference when _PROTEIN_ in the same cells . cells _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ have a punctuate _METHOD_ pattern that was expected for proteins located in the _LOCATION_ . the _METHOD_ pattern observed with the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ matched precisely the pattern observed with the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ revealing that _PROTEIN_ is a peroxisomal protein . in vivo complementation of the enoyl coa hydratase activity in s. in vivo enoyl coa hydratase activity of _PROTEIN_ was first assessed through the synthesis of pha in transgenic s. cerevisiae . pha is synthesized in bacteria from the polymerization of hydroxyacyl coa by a pha synthase . previous studies have shown that accumulation of pha in yeast _PROTEIN_ a p. aeruginosa pha synthase in the _LOCATION_ was dependent on the oxidation of fatty acids and on the generation of hydroxyacyl coa from the mfe encoded by the gene . fig . presents the gas chromatography _METHOD_ _METHOD_ profiles of monomers present in pha produced in s. cerevisiae strains grown in media containing tridecanoic acid . fig . displays the profile obtained from a wild type strain having an intact oxidation cycle . the hydroxy acid monomers are identified with the prefix h followed by the number of _PROTEIN_ in the chain and the number of unsaturated bonds . the pha produced is _PROTEIN_ composed of odd chain hydroxy acids corresponding to the hydroxyacyl coa intermediates generated by the oxidation of tridecanoic acid namely hydroxytridecanoic acid hydroxyundecanoic acid hydroxynonanoic acid and hydroxyheptanoic acid . fig . shows that in a strain devoid of mfe activity no pha is accumulated . fig . shows that _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the strain enabled the synthesis of pha that contained only as an odd chain monomer indicating that although the hydroxytridecanoyl coa was generated this intermediate was not further converted to oxo tridecanoyl coa to complete the oxidation cycle . these results indicated that _PROTEIN_ encoded an enoyl coa hydratase activity but was devoid of hydroxyacyl coa dehydrogenase activity normally associated with peroxisomal mfe . similar results were obtained when strain _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was grown in media containing fatty acids ranging from to _PROTEIN_ lengths namely that the pha formed contained primarily one monomer of the same _PROTEIN_ length as the external fatty acid used indicating that _PROTEIN_ has an affinity for a broad range of enoyl coas . similar results were obtained when strain _PROTEIN_ the cdna encoding the homologous protein from tomato . enzymatic activity in assays were performed as described by palosaari et al . by monitoring the production of oxoacyl coa from enoyl coa in the presence of either a hydroxyacyl coa dehydrogenase . conversion of enoyl coa to oxoacyl coa in the presence of the hydroxyacyl coa dehydrogenase fragment of the s. cerevisiae mfe was strictly dependent on extracts derived from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . no conversion was detectable by using protein extract from or by using a hydroxyacyl coa dehydrogenase derived from the rat mfe . substrates used were hexenoyl coa decenoyl coa and hexadecenoyl coa . table presents the maximal specific activities measured in the linear range of initial speed . _PROTEIN_ catalyzed in vitro the conversion of hexenoyl coa decenoyl coa and hexadecenoyl coa to the corresponding hydroxyacyl coa with a maximal activity measured for decenoyl coa . reverse activity from hydroxyacyl coa to enoyl coa was monitored as previously described by hiltunen et al . using a racemic mixture of hydroxydecanoyl coa . protein extract from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but not that of the parental strain was capable of catalyzing the conversion of hydroxyacyl coa to enoyl coa . these data demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ is a bidirectional enzyme converting enoyl coa to hydroxyacyl coa and vice versa . gene _PROTEIN_ in wild type and transgenic abundance of _PROTEIN_ at various stages of development and in different organs of wild type plants was monitored by northern blot analysis . _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in all plant organs . peaks of _PROTEIN_ can be seen in to day old germinating seedlings and during senescence of leaves . to assess the effect of increasing and _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ on the oxidation cycle transgenic plants were created that either contained _PROTEIN_ under the control of the strong constitutive promoter or an rna interference construct under the promoter for induction of gene silencing _PROTEIN_ . transgenic plants were generated in both the wild type col accession or in a transgenic line that was stably transformed and _PROTEIN_ a p. aeruginosa pha synthase gene modified for localization into the _LOCATION_ . this _PROTEIN_ line named has previously been shown to accumulate pha in the _LOCATION_ from the polymerization of the hydroxyacyl coa intermediates of the oxidation cycle . several independent lines were generated in each genetic background and plants homozygotes for the transgenes were selected . northern blot analysis was performed to isolate lines that either over or underexpressed _PROTEIN_ . fig . shows the _PROTEIN_ pattern of two selected underexpressing lines derived from the rnai _PROTEIN_ and two selected lines overexpressing _PROTEIN_ all in the background . similar levels of under and overexpression were also achieved in wild type lines without pha synthase . quantification of the signal intensities indicated an estimated down regulation of _PROTEIN_ by and fold in rnai line and rnai line compared with the control respectively and a to fold overexpression in the s line and s line over the phac control respectively . all plants tested that either over or underexpressed the _PROTEIN_ gene had the same physical appearance development rate germination rate in the absence of sucrose level of hypocotyl elongation in seedlings grown in the dark in the absence of sucrose and sensitivity to the auxin analogue dichlorophenoxybutyric acid . modulation of the _PROTEIN_ flux through oxidation in transgenic plants over or underexpressing _PROTEIN_ determine whether _PROTEIN_ participated in the degradation of fatty acids with a cis unsaturated bond on an even numbered _PROTEIN_ pha synthesized in lines overexpressing or underexpressing _PROTEIN_ in the background was analyzed . fig . presents the hydroxyacyl coas that are generated by the two alternative pathways portrayed in fig . that are involved in the degradation of fatty acids with a cis or trans unsaturated bond on an even numbered _PROTEIN_ . the model shows all hydroxyacyl coas until seven _PROTEIN_ that are generated by the degradation of heptadecenoic acid and heptadecenoic acid and is used for the interpretation of the pha monomer composition obtained in plants grown in media containing these two fatty acids . the pha synthase from p. aeruginosa is efficient at polymerizing hydroxyacyl coas ranging from to _PROTEIN_ in length . furthermore hydroxyacyl coa containing a double bond on _PROTEIN_ has been reported to be a poor substrate for the pha synthase and are typically not found in pha . because of the presence of a mfe the core oxidation cycle in plants generates the s stereoisomer of hydroxyacyl coa . therefore there are one or more steps required to change these hydroxyacyl coa intermediates into the corresponding r stereoisomers that are substrates for the pha synthase . such conversion could be generated by the hydroxyacyl coa epimerase activity of the plant mfe or the activity of the enoyl coa hydratase on enoyl coa intermediates . degradation of heptadecenoic acid via the reductase isomerase pathway or the hydratase epimerase pathway can be distinguished by the presence of different hydroxyacyl coas . thus whereas hydroxyundecanoyl coa is only generated by the reductase isomerase pathway and could be included into pha after its conversion to hydroxyundecanoyl coa the hydratase epimerase pathway generates the intermediate hydroxy undecenoyl coa which is not a substrate for the pha synthase . furthermore although the reductase isomerase pathway generates a hydroxynonanoyl coa the hydratase epimerase pathway generates directly a hydroxynonanoyl coa that can be directly incorporated into pha . similarly degradation by the hydratase epimerase pathway of the endogenous fatty acids linoleic acid and linolenic acid the two major fatty acids found in triacylglycerides of a. thaliana seeds would generate hydroxyoctanoic acid and hydroxyoctenoic acid respectively whereas all other hydroxyacyl coa intermediates would be hydroxyacyl coa . in contrast to heptadecenoic acid the degradation of heptadecenoic acid occurs via the intermediate undecadienoyl coa which can either be metabolized directly by the mfe to generate undecenoyl coa which is not a substrate to the pha synthase or by the successive reaction of the dienoyl coa isomerase enoyl coa isomerase and mfe to generate the intermediate hydroxyundecanoyl coa . thus although the degradation of heptadecenoic acid would be mediated by pathways generating only hydroxyacyl coas the degradation of heptadecenoic acid via the hydratase epimerase pathway would generate a hydroxynonanoyl coa whereas all other hydroxyacyl coas would be generated in the s conformation . fig . presents the monomer composition of pha generated in transgenic plants from the degradation of even chain endogenous fatty acids and odd chain exogenous fatty acids added to the growth media . unsaturated monomers present at < of dry weight in pha are difficult to reproducibly quantify in unpurified pha samples from plants and are thus not included in this analysis . the pha composition obtained from plant lines and overexpressing _PROTEIN_ in the background and grown in media containing heptadecenoic acid is presented in fig . . the parental line produced a polymer containing the monomers and generated from the degradation heptadecenoic acid and the monomers and generated from the degradation of the endogenous even chain fatty acids . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ led to a small but statistically significant _PROTEIN_ in the monomer in lines and as well as a small but significant _PROTEIN_ in and only in line . the abundance of all other monomers did not change to a statistically significant degree and the overall amount of pha in the overexpressing lines compared with control was not statistically different . effects of the down regulation of _PROTEIN_ on monomer composition of the pha are presented in fig . b and c. the control line used is a segregant of rnai line that does not contain the rna interference construct . in all experiments the quantity and monomer composition of the pha produced in this line were not significantly different from the pha produced in the parental line as well as to segregating lines from rnai line that did not contain the rna interference construct . fig . shows the effect of growth in medium containing heptadecenoic acid on pha composition for plants . analysis of the odd chain monomers generated by the degradation of the external fatty acids revealed a and fold increase in the monomer for the rnai lines and grown in heptadecenoic acid respectively . for even chain monomers the _PROTEIN_ changes observed were a and fold increase in the monomer and a and fold increase in the monomer for the rnai lines and respectively . compared with control the amounts of pha in rnai lines and increased by and fold . fig . presents the composition of the pha extracted from plants grown in media containing heptadecenoic acid . analysis revealed that the proportion of odd chain monomers derived from heptadecenoic acid degradation in the _PROTEIN_ underexpressing lines was not significantly different from the control plants . in contrast an increase in the and monomers in the two _PROTEIN_ underexpressing lines were still observed . no significant changes in pha quantity were observed among the different lines under these conditions . to further strengthen the link between reduced level of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and changes in pha monomer composition and pha quantity the effect _PROTEIN_ the tomato _PROTEIN_ in an _PROTEIN_ underexpressing line was analyzed . the _PROTEIN_ underexpressing line rnai line was transformed with a t dna carrying a cdna under the control of a double sequence promoter or with a control t dna vector without insert and homozygous plants for either construct were selected . fig . presents the composition of pha accumulated in plants growing in media containing heptadecenoic acid . _PROTEIN_ of in the _PROTEIN_ underexpressing line rnai line resulted in a reduction in the amount of pha as well as of the level of the and monomers back to levels comparable to the control line _PROTEIN_ the endogenous _PROTEIN_ .
