although telomere binding proteins constitute an essential part of telomeres in vivo data indicating the existence of a structure similar to mammalian shelterin complex in plants are limited . partial characterization of a number of candidate proteins has not identified true components of plant shelterin or elucidated their functional _METHOD_ . telomere repeat binding proteins from arabidopsis thaliana bind plant telomeric repeats through a myb domain of the telobox type in vitro and have been shown to interact with . here we demonstrate co localization of _PROTEIN_ protein with telomeres in situ using _METHOD_ microscopy as well as in vivo interaction using chromatin immunoprecipitation . classification of the _PROTEIN_ protein as a component of plant telomeres is further confirmed by the observation of shortening of telomeres in knockout mutants of the _PROTEIN_ gene . moreover trb proteins physically interact with plant telomerase catalytic subunits . these findings integrate trb proteins into the telomeric interactome of a. thaliana .
although a possible association of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with the telomere was suggested previously whether the _LOCATION_ speckles are directly associated with telomeres remained to be determined . here we took advantage of the well established protocol of nicotiana benthamiana leaf infiltration and the _PROTEIN_ that n. benthamiana has longer telomeres that are easier to visualize compared to arabidopsis . as shown in figure the localization of transiently transformed _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana leaf is similar to that observed in arabidopsis cell cultures as was shown by et al . labelling the whole _LOCATION_ with strong nucleolar signal and relatively strong _LOCATION_ speckles . _LOCATION_ from transformed leaves were isolated and used for telomere peptide _LOCATION_ acid fish . _METHOD_ from _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ remained very bright during the isolation procedure however a gentle denaturation step was necessary during the fish protocol to preserve the integrity of the _METHOD_ signal . these fish results showed that telomeres co localize or associate with _PROTEIN_ speckles in and of cases respectively with association overall . telomeric signals sometimes appeared as double dots connected to the _PROTEIN_ foci but in other cases co localize directly with _PROTEIN_ . these results provide in situ evidence of telomere occupancy by _PROTEIN_ . co localization of trb protein with telomeric probe.nuclei isolated from n. benthamiana were transformed with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct and hybridized with telomeric peptide _LOCATION_ acid labelled probe . co localization between _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ speckles and telomeric pna probe is detectable in most of the foci . control experiment without telomeric probe showing very little background present in the red channel . confocal image of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in an n. benthamiana leaf without any further sample processing . details of co localizing speckles imagej was used to create intensity plots for red and green channels . the observed co localization of _PROTEIN_ with telomeric tracts together with our previous detailed analyses of _PROTEIN_ binding to telomeric dna in vitro suggest the possibility that _PROTEIN_ protein directly recognizes telomeric repeats and belongs to the core components that shelter telomeres . we used a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay to isolate dna sequences associated with _PROTEIN_ protein . as source material we used formaldehyde cross linked seedlings of arabidopsis plants stably transformed with a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct driven by the native promoter _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . despite using the native promoter enhanced levels of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein were observed . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein was immunoprecipitated from purified _LOCATION_ using _METHOD_ trap a _PROTEIN_ which contains a single variable antibody domain that recognizes _METHOD_ . non specific binding of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to the _METHOD_ trap a _PROTEIN_ was excluded by precise detection of _METHOD_ in all fractions . we have shown that _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is washed out . dna co purifying with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was dot blotted onto nylon _LOCATION_ and visualized by hybridization with radioactively labelled telomeric probe . figure shows that _PROTEIN_ protein is indeed associated with telomeric sequence in vivo as telomeric sequence was repeatedly detected in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ but not wild type samples . to demonstrate that the observed enrichment is indeed due to sequence specific association and not due to the high copy number of the telomeric dna we hybridized dna co purified with trb _METHOD_ with a centromeric probe . as our previous results showed localization of _PROTEIN_ protein in the _LOCATION_ and nucleolus another candidate sequence investigated for association with _PROTEIN_ was ribosomal dna . only negligible enrichment of the centromeric or rdna probe in contrast to significant enrichment of the telomeric probe was observed when comparing each wild type to trb _METHOD_ sample . _PROTEIN_ proteins are associated with telomeric sequence in vivo.dna cross linked with _PROTEIN_ protein was isolated by _PROTEIN_ analysis using _METHOD_ trap a _PROTEIN_ from wild type and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants . hybridization of isolated dna with radioactively labelled telomeric oligonucleotide in three biologically and technically replicated experiments confirmed the hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ protein is associated with telomeric sequence in vivo . as a control telomeric oligonucleotide was dot blotted on the same _LOCATION_ and visualized together with immunoprecipitated dna . to examine the role of _PROTEIN_ in planta we analysed t dna insertion line . three parallel wild type and homozygous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines were derived from three independent heterozygous plants . the homozygosity of each parallel wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plant line was determined by pcr . the t dna insertion is located in the second intron and the absence of _PROTEIN_ transcript was confirmed by rt pcr . _PROTEIN_ analysis of _PROTEIN_ protein in mutant _PROTEIN_ wild type and transformed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants . schematic illustration of specific primers and t dna insertion location within the _PROTEIN_ gene . the domain location and antibody recognition sites for two specific antibodies developed in our laboratory are shown below . three individual plant lines were derived from heterozygous progenitors . example of pcr analysis of genomic dna isolated from wt plants and mutant _PROTEIN_ plants of line b . rt pcr of rna isolated from wt and mutant _PROTEIN_ plants of line b using primers . immunodetection by western blot analysis of _PROTEIN_ protein in wt and mutant _PROTEIN_ plants of line b and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plant _LOCATION_ extracts using specific antibody recognizing the myb like domain of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the level of native _PROTEIN_ protein is lower compared to the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein construct _PROTEIN_ under the control of the native promoter . immunolocalization of _PROTEIN_ protein using anti _METHOD_ and anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . the level of native _PROTEIN_ protein in the wild type is very low . the selected plant line does not show _METHOD_ labelling in all cells so some _LOCATION_ contain a wild type level of _PROTEIN_ and others show higher _PROTEIN_ due to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . thus the intensity of signal may be clearly measured as wt and over _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ are present together on one slide and may be clearly distinguished using specific anti _PROTEIN_ protein antibody and anti _METHOD_ antibody . trb proteins consist of three domains myb like histone like and a coiled coil domain . as no antibody recognizing either trb proteins or the plant myb domain of the telobox type is commercially available we developed specific mouse monoclonal antibodies in our laboratory . two of them were used in this study _PROTEIN_ and . the location of antibody recognition sites within the structure of _PROTEIN_ as determined by elisa is shown in figure . although the conservative part of the telobox myb domain is also present in arabidopsis trf like family proteins these proteins are not recognized by the or antibodies . the anti trb or antibodies were unable to detect in vitro _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or or _PROTEIN_ from the trfl family . antibody was used to detect native _PROTEIN_ protein in arabidopsis plant protein extracts . the natural level of _PROTEIN_ protein was clearly observed on western blots of wild type plants but no _PROTEIN_ protein was observed for extracts from _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . in addition plant lines stably transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct under the control of native promoter showed a distinct abundance of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein compared to the native _PROTEIN_ protein . various _PROTEIN_ levels of native _PROTEIN_ protein and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were also apparent after immunolocalization in vivo in which _PROTEIN_ protein is visualized using either anti _PROTEIN_ antibody or anti _METHOD_ antibody . we tested both antibodies by indirect _METHOD_ on _PROTEIN_ mutant and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants . these experiments showed evenly distributed _LOCATION_ and nucleolar signals for both and antibodies . antibody did not detect any signal in _PROTEIN_ plants but antibody recognizes some epitopes in _PROTEIN_ . however the generated antibodies do not appear to be of sufficient quality for more demanding immunolocalization or _PROTEIN_ experiments . derivation of independent wild type and _PROTEIN_ plant lines from three heterozygous progeny provided reliable material for phenotypic studies of the _PROTEIN_ null mutation effect . all six homozygous plant lines were propagated for five generations . the telomeres are shortened in all three individually derived _PROTEIN_ mutant plant lines . derivation of three independent plant lines that were propagated for five generations . terminal restriction fragment analysis showing telomere shortening in the _PROTEIN_ mutant line compared with the wild type control in the fifth generation . difference in mutant _PROTEIN_ and wild type telomere lengths in three independent plant lines . _LOCATION_ bars represent standard deviation . obvious shortening of telomeres was observed by terminal restriction fragment analysis in all three _PROTEIN_ mutant lines analysed in the fifth generation compared to their segregated wild type siblings . hybridization with a radioactively labelled telomeric probe revealed truncation of telomeric tracts in _PROTEIN_ lines by approximately . the graph represents evaluation in the three biological replicates . observations in earlier generations of _PROTEIN_ lines show mild but progressive shortening that continues through the generations . despite clear and reproducible telomere shortening in _PROTEIN_ no significant morphological differences were observed in rosette diameter leaf number flowering and seed set when analysing soil grown wild type and _PROTEIN_ . our previous finding that _PROTEIN_ protein interacts with and evidence presented here showing that _PROTEIN_ co localizes with telomeric repeats and is involved in regulation of telomere _PROTEIN_ suggest its possible association with telomerase . we therefore tested the possibility of direct interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as well as the influence of _PROTEIN_ on telomerase activity in vitro . as _PROTEIN_ is a high molecular weight protein we used _PROTEIN_ fragments containing n terminal domains associated with distinct telomeric functions to detect a possible direct interaction between _PROTEIN_ and trb proteins . we tested their ability to interact using a based yeast two hybrid system in which interactions take place inside the _LOCATION_ . as shown in figure strong interaction between _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ fragment was observed on histidine deficient plates . this interaction was confirmed under stringent adenine selection . clear interactions between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and a weak interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were also observed under histidine selection . further testing _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with a longer fragment of _PROTEIN_ confirmed these interactions . trb proteins interact with plant telomerase _PROTEIN_ . schematic depiction of the catalytic subunit of telomerase _PROTEIN_ showing evolutionarily conserved motifs . n terminal fragments containing the telomerase specific motifs ten and trbd were used in protein protein interaction analysis . yeast two hybrid system was used to assess interaction of trb proteins with n terminal _PROTEIN_ fragments . two sets of plasmids carrying the indicated segments of _PROTEIN_ fused to either the dna binding domain or the activation domain were constructed and introduced into yeast strain carrying reporter genes and . although weak interactions often fail to rescue growth under stringent adenine selection plausible trb _PROTEIN_ interactions were observed on histidine deficient plates . co transformation with an empty vector served as a negative control . bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation confirmed the interaction of trb proteins with _PROTEIN_ fragments . arabidopsis leaf protoplasts were co transfected with each of plasmids encoding _METHOD_ tagged trb clones _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ fragments or _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ . the cells were imaged by _METHOD_ microscopy after overnight incubation . clear _LOCATION_ interactions of trb proteins with _PROTEIN_ fragments are observed on the protoplast images _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ chloroplast _METHOD_ chloroplast _METHOD_ is also visible in the _METHOD_ channel . scale bars . to test whether the interactions observed in a yeast two hybrid system are reproducible in the plant cell we used a bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation assay . arabidopsis protoplasts were transfected with plasmids encoding _METHOD_ tagged trb constructs and _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ fragments and a clear intra _LOCATION_ interaction was observed . the _PROTEIN_ fragments used in bifc _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ overlap with the fragments tested in the yeast two hybrid system . the interaction was further verified by co immunoprecipitation experiments in which proteins were _PROTEIN_ in rabbit reticulocyte lysate from the same vectors used in yeast two hybrid system . as shown in figure clear interactions between _PROTEIN_ and all three _PROTEIN_ fragments were observed . obvious interactions were also detected between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ but only weak interactions were observed between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fragments . the generally weaker interactions of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ proteins with _PROTEIN_ fragments in comparison to the corresponding interactions of _PROTEIN_ were due to lower _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins in rabbit reticulocyte lysate . to determine whether interaction between trb proteins and _PROTEIN_ directly influences telomerase activity we used a telomere repeat amplification protocol . in extracts from _PROTEIN_ plants no changes in telomerase activity or processivity were observed . correspondingly no variations in telomerase activity were detected in transformed plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ higher levels of protein . this observation is in agreement with our previous experiments in which escherichia coli _PROTEIN_ and purified _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins were added to the trap assay .
