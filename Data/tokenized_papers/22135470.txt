plant cell wall pectic polysaccharides are arguably the most complex _PROTEIN_ in nature . progress in understanding pectin synthesis has been slow due to its complex structure and difficulties in purifying and _PROTEIN_ the low abundance _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ bound pectin biosynthetic enzymes . arabidopsis galacturonosyltransferase is an galacturonosyltransferase that synthesizes homogalacturonan the most abundant pectic polysaccharide . we now show that _PROTEIN_ functions in a protein complex with the homologous _PROTEIN_ . surprisingly although both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are type ii _LOCATION_ proteins with single n terminal transmembrane spanning domains the n terminal region of _PROTEIN_ including the transmembrane domain is cleaved in vivo . this raises the question of how the processed _PROTEIN_ is retained in the _LOCATION_ the site of hg biosynthesis . we show that the anchoring of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ requires association with _PROTEIN_ to form the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complex . proteomics analyses also identified additional proteins that immunoprecipitate with the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complex . this study provides conclusive evidence that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complex is the catalytic core of an hg galat complex and that cell wall _PROTEIN_ polysaccharide biosynthesis occurs via protein complexes . the processing of _PROTEIN_ to remove its n terminal transmembrane domain and its anchoring in the _LOCATION_ by association with _PROTEIN_ provides an example of how specific catalytic domains of plant cell wall biosynthetic glycosyltransferases could be assembled into protein complexes to enable the synthesis of the complex and developmentally and environmentally plastic plant cell wall .
polyclonal antibodies against aa positions of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ predicted stem region recognized a broad doublet band of kda confirmed to be _PROTEIN_ by _METHOD_ sequencing . immunoadsorption of _PROTEIN_ from the arabidopsis sp fraction using anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies caused an antibody dependent depletion of galat activity from the supernatant and recovery of galat activity in the anti _PROTEIN_ immunoadsorbed pellet . the results suggested that _PROTEIN_ was either a galat or part of a galat complex . protein complexes involved in n linked glycoprotein glycolipid and proteoglycan syntheses have been reported and demonstrated or suggested in plant starch cellulose and hemicellulose syntheses . however molecular analysis of a plant wall _PROTEIN_ polysaccharide biosynthetic complex has not been reported . to test whether _PROTEIN_ exists in a galat complex with _PROTEIN_ independent anti _PROTEIN_ and anti _PROTEIN_ immunoadsorbed proteins were separated by reducing _PROTEIN_ and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti _PROTEIN_ and anti _PROTEIN_ sera . arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ coimmunoprecipitated from the sp fraction demonstrating biochemically that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ exist in a protein complex . because protein colocalization within the same cellular subcompartment is a prerequisite for complex formation we used bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation to test for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ colocalization in the _LOCATION_ . transient _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaves of _PROTEIN_ fused to full length _METHOD_ yielded punctate signals overlapping with those of the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and indicating _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ fused to full length _METHOD_ was also tested but did not give any signals . _METHOD_ complementation with characteristic _LOCATION_ signal morphology was observed upon transient coexpression of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ each fused to complementary split halves of _METHOD_ . neither _PROTEIN_ nor _PROTEIN_ constructs complemented _METHOD_ with _PROTEIN_ yn _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ whereas the positive control _PROTEIN_ yc did fluoresce . coexpression of _PROTEIN_ yc yielded no signal whereas that of _PROTEIN_ yc gave variable _METHOD_ . the specific _METHOD_ complementation between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ that these proteins colocalize within a specific _LOCATION_ subcompartment and supports their association in a protein complex . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are coexpressed in arabidopsis we analyzed arabidopsis gene _PROTEIN_ databases and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ promoter gus construct _PROTEIN_ in transgenic arabidopsis . microarray data show similar _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in all plant tissues with pearson correlation coefficients of and from the gene co _PROTEIN_ analysis toolbox and arabidopsis co _PROTEIN_ analysis tool respectively . promoter gus fusions indicate high _PROTEIN_ of both genes in meristematic regions vascular tissues and reproductive organs and support a role for both proteins in primary and secondary wall syntheses . extensive coexpression was observed in seedling cotyledon tips and vasculature leaf primordia and outer edges of young leaves and to wk old plant cambium phloem epidermis cortex stem metaxylem and protoxylem anthers pollen floral distal stigma and root vascular cambium and phloem . the coexpression of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is consistent with their function in a protein complex . the immunoprecipitated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complex transfers gala from udp gala onto hg oligosaccharide acceptors similar to the reported galat activity in solubilized _LOCATION_ preparations . to test whether the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complex transfers gala onto rg i and/or rg ii acceptors substrate specificity was examined by comparing ogas of degrees of polymerization rg i backbone oligomers of dp with either a rhamnosyl residue or a gala residue at the nonreducing end and rg ii monomer . fig ref shows that the immunoprecipitated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complex as well as galat activity in the arabidopsis sp fraction is highly selective for ogas verifying the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complex as an hg galat . some _PROTEIN_ complexes are known to contain disulfide bonds . we tested whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ associated via disulfide bonds by separating proteins from the arabidopsis sp fraction on reducing versus nonreducing _PROTEIN_ followed by western blotting . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ migrated as monomers when separated by reducing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . however both proteins resolved at a similar high molecular weight upon nonreducing _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are held together by an intermolecular disulfide bond in a common heterocomplex . to confirm that disulfide bonding indeed held _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in a heterocomplex we performed immunoprecipitation of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complex from the arabidopsis sp fraction pretreated with denaturing agents a reducing agent or both denaturing and reducing agents . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complex remained intact under denaturing or reducing conditions alone but dissociated when both denaturing and reducing agents were present . this result establishes covalent intermolecular disulfide bonding between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ whereas noncovalent interactions may reinforce the integrity of the disulfide bonded complex . we used repetitive high stringency proteomics to identify components of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complex held together by covalent and noncovalent interactions . the complex was immunoprecipitated independently using antigen purified anti _PROTEIN_ and anti _PROTEIN_ specific iggs each covalently attached to magnetic beads . after stringent washing the immunoprecipitants were eluted from the beads and resolved by _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ galat core complex and putative associating proteins as revealed by proteomics analyses of the immunoprecipitated complex to examine the minimal disulfide bonded _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complex stable upon nonreducing _PROTEIN_ the kda protein band of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ core complex was excised from the gel in gel trypsin digested and subjected to liquid chromatography tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were the only two proteins identified by lc _METHOD_ in each independent anti _PROTEIN_ and anti _PROTEIN_ specific igg immunoprecipitant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . neither _PROTEIN_ nor _PROTEIN_ was detected in the preimmune igg immunoprecipitation control . the results establish that the nonreducing _PROTEIN_ stable complex consists only of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . based on the size of the complex observed in nonreducing _PROTEIN_ and the normalized spectral abundance _PROTEIN_ values of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from the lc _METHOD_ data the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ core complex is likely to be a trimeric complex consisting of two _PROTEIN_ subunits and one _PROTEIN_ subunit . we reasoned that the minimal disulfide bonded _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complex may be a core complex associating noncovalently with additional proteins to form a larger pectin synthesis complex e.g. with methyltransferases to synthesize methylesterified hg . indeed the size of detergent solubilized polygalacturonic acid synthase from azuki bean was estimated as kda . to test for possible _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ core complex associating proteins eluted immunoprecipitants were resolved by reducing _PROTEIN_ and analyzed by lc _METHOD_ . because preliminary data showed immunoprecipitated proteins from to kda we focused on these for the proteomics analyses . ten proteins including _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were consistently identified in each ip _PROTEIN_ and ip _PROTEIN_ immunoprecipitant but not in the ip control as determined using two high stringency proteomics data filtering methods . four other proteins were more than fourfold more abundant in ip _PROTEIN_ and ip _PROTEIN_ than in the ip control . the proteins including _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ represent the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ core complex and its putative associating proteins . while it remains possible that all or some of the proteins form a large holocomplex the relatively low nsaf values of the additional proteins compared with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ suggest that they may transiently interact with the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ core complex . several _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ core complex putative associating proteins are noteworthy . the two dehydration responsive proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ contain a putative methyltransferase domain _PROTEIN_ and have homology to _PROTEIN_ a putative homogalacturonan methyltransferase . recently _PROTEIN_ has also been proposed as a putative hg mt designated _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have been localized to the _LOCATION_ as has hg mt activity and are coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . these results support the proposition that methylation of hg occurs as it is synthesized or immediately thereafter . the presence of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a _LOCATION_ bound endo _PROTEIN_ implicated in cellulose biosynthesis as a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complex putative associating protein warrants further investigation . _PROTEIN_ mutants are dwarf defective in cell elongation and have reduced wall crystalline cellulose that is compensated by increased pectin . _PROTEIN_ localizes to a heterogeneous population of intracellular compartments including the _LOCATION_ . perhaps most intriguingly two homologs of mammalian ribophorins i and ii _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are among the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complex putative interacting proteins . these ribophorins are subunits of oligosaccharyltransferase an enzyme complex that transfers oligosaccharides en bloc from dolichol pyrophosphates onto proteins as they translocate into the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ lumen . the identification of the ribophorins raises the possibility that biosynthesis of hg or of pectin in general may occur by en bloc transfer of oligosaccharide domains to a growing polysaccharide . arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ is predicted to be a kda protein yet always resolved at kda . we proposed that the discrepancy between the predicted and observed sizes of _PROTEIN_ was due to posttranslational proteolytic processing in planta . this was tested using three independent anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies reactive against _PROTEIN_ aa positions and . whereas all three antibodies detected recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in cells only the antibodies generated against aa and recognized _PROTEIN_ in immunoblots of the arabidopsis sp fraction suggesting that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ is proteolytically cleaved in vivo in the n terminal region . n terminal sequencing of _PROTEIN_ excised from a reducing _PROTEIN_ blotted _LOCATION_ yielded the peptide sequence ranelvq indicating a cleavage between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ that yields a processed arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ of kda and pi of consistent with the observed characteristics of _PROTEIN_ in the sp fraction . the cleavage site was also supported by lc _METHOD_ analyses of immunoprecipitated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complex which gave no _PROTEIN_ peptide sequence n terminal to _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ aa sequence surrounding this proposed cleavage site is consistent with the consensus motif recognized by subtilisin like proprotein convertases in the secretory pathway . proteolytic cleavage at stem regions by secretory pathway proteases has been documented with many other _PROTEIN_ . whereas the resulting soluble truncated _PROTEIN_ are typically secreted out of the cell the n glycosylation enzyme glcnact i was reported cleaved but retained in the _LOCATION_ via inclusion in hmw oligomers mediated by its luminal domain . _PROTEIN_ cleavage in planta could activate the enzyme as described for arabidopsis and tobacco type i pectin methylesterases or could facilitate specific _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ association to form the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ core complex and/or a larger fully functional pectin biosynthetic complex . further studies are needed to establish the function of _PROTEIN_ processing . a cleavage between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ would render _PROTEIN_ devoid of its transmembrane domain and thus secreted out of the cell unless a tethering mechanism retained it in the _LOCATION_ . we hypothesized that interaction with _PROTEIN_ retained _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ . to test this _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs were individually and coexpressed in tobacco leaves . when individually _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not yield a _LOCATION_ signal whereas _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did . however when coexpressed accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ overlapped with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ also accumulated in the _LOCATION_ when coexpressed with nontagged _PROTEIN_ . the results demonstrate that retention of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ requires the presence of _PROTEIN_ and suggest that _PROTEIN_ acts as a _LOCATION_ anchor for _PROTEIN_ . to further explore the _PROTEIN_ tethering mechanism three _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion constructs were transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco with and without coexpressed nontagged _PROTEIN_ . the constructs were _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ containing only the first aa of _PROTEIN_ including the predicted tmd but not the proposed cleavage site and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ containing the first aa of _PROTEIN_ including both the predicted tmd and cleavage site but not the first cysteine beyond the predicted tmd _PROTEIN_ . transient _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ yielded _PROTEIN_ dependent _METHOD_ accumulation in _LOCATION_ . in contrast despite the absence or presence of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ yielded a broad labeling pattern including _LOCATION_ and punctate _LOCATION_ like structures whereas _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulated no observable signal . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ sufficient to target the protein to the secretory pathway but does not provide _LOCATION_ specific localization . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ however likely underwent proteolytic cleavage releasing the c terminally located _METHOD_ from the _LOCATION_ and resulting in secretion into the apoplast where _METHOD_ generates weak or no _METHOD_ because of the low ph environment . the results indicate a cleavage site between aa and consistent with the proposed cleavage site between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ suggest the importance of disulfide bonding between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to retain _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ and indicate a region downstream of aa in _PROTEIN_ as required for specific protein protein interactions between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . based on all the data presented we propose a heterotrimeric model for the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ core complex of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ held together by a covalent disulfide bond and other noncovalent interactions . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ each contain eight cysteine residues . one or more of these is proposed to function in disulfide bond formation . _PROTEIN_ is the catalytic subunit of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ hg galat complex . _PROTEIN_ functions at least in part to anchor _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . interestingly it was reported that _PROTEIN_ carries an amino acid substitution in a proposed catalytic residue that would render it noncatalytic . this proposition needs experimental verification but is consistent with a _PROTEIN_ anchoring noncatalytic role for _PROTEIN_ . heterocomplex formation of closely related _PROTEIN_ has been shown to have functional significance . for examples proper folding of the mammalian o glycosylation enzyme galt in the _LOCATION_ requires complex formation with the homologous type ii transmembrane protein cosmc whereas complex formation of human protein o mannosylation enzymes and is necessary for enzymatic activity of otherwise inactive subunits . heterocomplex formation of the heparan sulfate biosynthetic enzymes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ results in a _LOCATION_ localized enzyme complex with significantly higher glcnact/glcat activities than those of the individual components and with a polymerizing capability . it is plausible that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complex may have substantially higher catalytic and/or polymerizing activities compared with the individual subunits . the work reported here indicates that pectin hg synthesis occurs via tethering of a galat catalytic subunit _PROTEIN_ to a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ bound protein anchor _PROTEIN_ . how widespread this phenomenon is in the synthesis of cell wall polysaccharides remains to be determined . it is interesting to speculate however that _LOCATION_ tethering proteins such as _PROTEIN_ may play a broader role in promoting the association of _PROTEIN_ and polysaccharide modifying enzymes into complexes to achieve the synthesis of specific wall polysaccharide domains . in this _PROTEIN_ it is noteworthy that multiple _PROTEIN_ homologs exist in the grass family suggesting a unique role for _PROTEIN_ like proteins in grasses . further studies of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ core complex and its associating proteins are likely to expand our view of how diverse _PROTEIN_ and polysaccharide modifying enzymes interact to produce cell type and developmental stage specific wall polymers .
