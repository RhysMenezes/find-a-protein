the seed maturation genes are specifically and highly _PROTEIN_ during _PROTEIN_ embryogenesis . in this work yeast two hybrid bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation and coimmunoprecipitation assays revealed that histone _PROTEIN_ interacted with the high _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of sugar _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the zinc finger cw domain of _PROTEIN_ was responsible for the interaction . furthermore we found that mutations in _PROTEIN_ resulted in the ectopic _PROTEIN_ of seed maturation genes in seedlings which was associated with increased levels of gene activation marks such as histone acetylation histone acetylation and histone lys tri methylation but _PROTEIN_ levels of the gene repression mark histone lys tri methylation in the promoter and/or coding regions . in addition elevated transcription of certain seed maturation genes was also found in the _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings which was also accompanied by the enrichment of gene activation marks but _PROTEIN_ levels of the gene repression mark . chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that _PROTEIN_ could directly bind to the chromatin of the seed maturation genes . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may act together to repress seed maturation gene _PROTEIN_ during germination . further genetic analyses revealed that the homozygous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants are embryonic lethal suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may play a vital role during embryogenesis .
previous studies suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are redundant inhibitors of sugar inducible ectopic _PROTEIN_ of seed maturation genes during seedling growth and the two proteins together play an essential role in regulating the transition from seed maturation to active seedling growth . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ belong to the _PROTEIN_ family and contain a plant specific dna binding domain . in addition _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ contain the zf cw domain which has been identified as a member of the histone modification reader modules for epigenetic regulation . using the database of protein domain interactions it is predicted that _PROTEIN_ may interact with the zinc finger domain . we therefore tested whether there is a direct protein protein interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . the yeast two hybrid assay indicated that _PROTEIN_ interacted with _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ . to further confirm the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation and coimmunoprecipitation assays were used . previous studies have proved that _PROTEIN_ is localized in the _LOCATION_ . the localization of _PROTEIN_ was analyzed by _PROTEIN_ a gene encoding an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ fusion protein under the control of the promoter in the arabidopsis protoplasts . as shown in figure the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was localized in the _LOCATION_ of the arabidopsis cells . the localization of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant was also analyzed by _PROTEIN_ a gene encoding an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein under the control of the promoter in the _PROTEIN_ protoplasts . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was localized in the _LOCATION_ of the _PROTEIN_ cells . for bifc assays _PROTEIN_ was fused to the n terminal amino acid protein of _METHOD_ in the _GENE_ vector and _PROTEIN_ was fused to the c terminal amino acid protein of _METHOD_ in the _GENE_ vector . the corresponding constructs were codelivered into protoplasts of arabidopsis and _METHOD_ was observed using a confocal microscope . as shown in figure yellow _METHOD_ was clearly visible in the _LOCATION_ . similar results were also observed using rice protoplasts . these data indicated that _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ . the co ip assay was also performed to further determine the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . tobacco leaves were infiltrated with agrobacterium tumefaciens cultures carrying ha _PROTEIN_ and myc _PROTEIN_ and leaf extracts were analyzed by co ip . when ha _PROTEIN_ and myc _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins were transiently coexpressed in tobacco leaf cells the myc _PROTEIN_ fusion protein can be coimmunoprecipitated with ha _PROTEIN_ . in order to identify the specific regions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ that are involved in the interaction we generated four and three deletion constructs of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . it was found that _PROTEIN_ interacted with the _PROTEIN_ zf but not _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ear and _PROTEIN_ whereas _PROTEIN_ zf only interacted with _PROTEIN_ . bifc and co ip assays further confirmed that _PROTEIN_ zf and _PROTEIN_ are responsible for the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ can directly interact with _PROTEIN_ and the zf cw domain in the c terminal region of _PROTEIN_ and the region of _PROTEIN_ are responsible for the interaction between these two proteins . based on the database from the arabidopsis information resource _METHOD_ _METHOD_ the _PROTEIN_ of many seed maturation genes was relatively high in the _PROTEIN_ stages of embryo development but low in the early stages of embryo development . by contrast we found that the _PROTEIN_ of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was higher in the early stages of embryo development than that in the _PROTEIN_ stages . these _PROTEIN_ profiling results suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may act together to participate in regulating the transition from seed maturation to seedling growth . the _PROTEIN_ pattern of seed maturation genes in germinating _PROTEIN_ seedlings was analyzed by quantitative rt pcr . we examined the _PROTEIN_ of eight seed maturation genes cruciferina _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in d old seedlings of a _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ . except _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ of all other genes was increased in the d old seedlings of _PROTEIN_ compared with wassilewskija wild type seedlings . the _PROTEIN_ of the seed maturation genes including _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was also investigated in d old seedlings of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants by qrt pcr . both the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants were in the columbia background . as shown in figure the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were increased in the d old seedlings of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants compared with col wild type seedlings . a previous study suggested that _PROTEIN_ was involved in the repression of embryo specific genes during germination but the underlying molecular _METHOD_ are unclear . to analyze whether the ectopic _PROTEIN_ of seed maturation genes in the _PROTEIN_ mutant is related to the change in histone acetylation and methylation in chromatin _PROTEIN_ assays were performed to analyze the chromatin of the seed maturation genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the d old seedlings of the wild type and _PROTEIN_ . since histone acetylation and methylation can occur in both the proximal promoters and/or exons we therefore investigated the histone modification of the dna sequences corresponding to the proximal promoters and the first exon regions of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . as a control we also investigated the change of histone acetylation and methylation in the proximal promoter of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings compared with the ws wild type . since no changes in histone acetylation and methylation were found in the promoter of _PROTEIN_ we used _PROTEIN_ as an internal control to normalize the _PROTEIN_ quantitative pcr results . we first used antibodies specific for acetylated histone and histone . as shown in figures and increased acetylation levels of both histones and in the proximal promoter and/or coding region of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were observed in the _PROTEIN_ seedlings . we also performed _PROTEIN_ assays with antibodies specific for acetylated lys residues of histone and . as shown in supplemental figure online the increased acetylation levels of _PROTEIN_ and on and/or regions of these genes were also observed in _PROTEIN_ . these results are consistent with citation that _PROTEIN_ and are involved in activating the _PROTEIN_ of seed maturation genes . _PROTEIN_ analyses were also performed using antibodies specific for methylated lys residues of and . _PROTEIN_ using the antibody showed that was increased on the region and/or region of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . this result is in line with the general observation that trimethylation at is associated with gene activation . by contrast _PROTEIN_ using and antibodies showed that these methylation marks were _PROTEIN_ on the region and/or region of these genes in the _PROTEIN_ background . these data were consistent with the observations that was required for the repression of seed maturation genes and was generally associated with silenced genes . we further performed _PROTEIN_ seq analysis using the _PROTEIN_ and antibodies in the d old seedlings of ws and _PROTEIN_ . in ws we identified genes that underwent _PROTEIN_ acetylation but only four of them _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were found to be involved in seed development . by contrast we identified genes that underwent _PROTEIN_ acetylation in _PROTEIN_ and of them were involved in seed development . we also identified and genes that underwent methylation in ws and _PROTEIN_ respectively . among those genes that underwent methylation and genes were involved in seed development in ws and _PROTEIN_ respectively . in _PROTEIN_ mutants we observed a significant increase of the _PROTEIN_ level of target genes including those genes involved in seed development indicating that _PROTEIN_ plays an important role in regulating the levels of _PROTEIN_ and gene activities . to analyze whether the ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mutants is also related to the change of histone acetylation and methylation in the chromatin _PROTEIN_ assay was used to analyze histone acetylation and methylation levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in d old seedlings of the _PROTEIN_ mutant compared with the col wild type seedlings . for comparison the _PROTEIN_ mutant in col background _PROTEIN_ was also analyzed . as shown in figures to increased levels of and in the proximal promoter and coding region of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were observed in the d old _PROTEIN_ seedlings compared with the col wild type seedlings . by contrast the abundance of was _PROTEIN_ in the d old _PROTEIN_ seedlings . the levels of and were not changed in both the proximal promoter and coding region of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which is consistent with the observation that the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ exhibited little change in the _PROTEIN_ mutants compared with the col wild type plants . these results suggested that the ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mutants was due to the change of histone acetylation and methylation levels . to further investigate whether _PROTEIN_ directly targets to seed maturation genes during seed germination arabidopsis plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were used to perform a _PROTEIN_ assay . for the _PROTEIN_ d old seedlings were selected to investigate the enrichment of _PROTEIN_ in the promoter and/or coding region of the seed maturation genes in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants compared with wild type plants . qrt pcr was used to determine the regions enriched by _PROTEIN_ with an anti _METHOD_ antibody . as shown in figures to _PROTEIN_ was recruited to the proximal promoters of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as well as the regions surrounding the translational starting sites of and _PROTEIN_ suggesting that these genes probably are direct targets regulated by _PROTEIN_ . to investigate the genetic relationship between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we tried to generate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants . in a preliminary experiment we failed to obtain any homozygous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants in seedlings . we therefore selected one allele combination _PROTEIN_ for detailed analysis . as shown in figure both green round seeds and yellow wrinkled seeds were observed in the siliques from the double heterozygous plants . the embryos in the yellow wrinkled seeds were not properly developed compared with the embryos in the green round seeds . we also investigated other _PROTEIN_ mutants and similar phenotypes were observed . interestingly the ratios of aborted seeds in the immature siliques of _PROTEIN_ plants were much lower than an expected ratio of . this likely resulted from the linkage between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ because both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are located on chromosome . we estimated that the recombination frequency between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was and the expected ratio of total seeds to aborted seeds was . as shown in table the actual ratio of each _PROTEIN_ plants was consistent with the expected ratio of . aborted seeds were observed in the immature and mature siliques from _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants . among progeny seedlings of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants analyzed no _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ homozygous double mutants were obtained . taken together these results indicate that the homozygous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants are embryo lethal . therefore _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may play an essential role during embryo development .
