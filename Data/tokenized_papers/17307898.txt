recent evidence indicates that adp ribosylation _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ carries out multiple roles in plant cells that may be independent from the established effector complex _PROTEIN_ . to investigate potential _PROTEIN_ independent functions we have followed the dynamics of _PROTEIN_ and a novel putative effector the plant _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ related arf binding domain containing arabidopsis protein _PROTEIN_ in living plant cells . we present data that ascribe a new role to _PROTEIN_ in plant cell _LOCATION_ traffic by showing that the _PROTEIN_ functions to recruit _PROTEIN_ to _LOCATION_ . in addition although _PROTEIN_ appears to be central to the recruitment of both _PROTEIN_ components and the _LOCATION_ we have established a different subcellular distribution of these _PROTEIN_ effectors . live cell imaging demonstrates that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are distributed on _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . however _PROTEIN_ is also found on _PROTEIN_ labeled structures that lack coatomer suggesting that the _LOCATION_ environment rather than _PROTEIN_ alone influences the differential recruitment of _PROTEIN_ effectors . in support of this hypothesis _METHOD_ recovery after photobleaching analyses demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have different kinetics on _LOCATION_ during the cycle of activation and inactivation of _PROTEIN_ . therefore our data support a model where modulation of the cellular functions of _PROTEIN_ in plant cells encompasses not only the intrinsic activities of the effectors but also differential recruitment onto _LOCATION_ that is spatially regulated .
the arabidopsis genome encodes a sequence with identity and similarity at the amino acid level to the human that we propose be called _PROTEIN_ related arf binding domain containing arabidopsis protein _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is a protein of amino acid residues with a predicted molecular _METHOD_ of kd . to determine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ we fused it to a yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ it in tobacco leaf epidermal cells . laser confocal microscopy analyses indicated that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labeled punctate structures of heterogeneous size that were motile in the cell . the larger structures labeled by _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were often observed in a distinct _PROTEIN_ formation . as the punctate subcellular distribution of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ resembled that of the plant _LOCATION_ apparatus tobacco leaf epidermal cells were cotransformed with the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion and the _LOCATION_ marker _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ colocalized with the larger punctate structures of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . however other structures were labeled solely by _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the distribution of _PROTEIN_ was similar to that of _PROTEIN_ which _PROTEIN_ localizes to the _LOCATION_ apparatus but also additional non _LOCATION_ structures . to test this further we coexpressed _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . all the structures labeled by _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ showed colocalization with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . this shows that the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ colocalize to extra _LOCATION_ structures . furthermore _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ structures were stained by the styryl dye which labels compartments localized to the endocytic route consistent with earlier findings . the colocalization results of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ led us to question whether _PROTEIN_ could be functionally linked to _PROTEIN_ . to explore this we wanted to test the influence of _PROTEIN_ on _PROTEIN_ recruitment to _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ directly recruits coatomer to _LOCATION_ in its active form . we postulated that if similarly to coatomer _PROTEIN_ recruits _PROTEIN_ to _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ restricted mutant of _PROTEIN_ which mimics the active form of _PROTEIN_ would enhance signal of the _LOCATION_ on _LOCATION_ in comparison to a control _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ alone . to test this hypothesis we coexpressed _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ which is known to overlap with the distribution of wild type _PROTEIN_ . we assessed _PROTEIN_ recruitment by taking measurements of the _METHOD_ intensity within areas of identical size that included the punctate structures labeled by _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ alone or in combination with _PROTEIN_ normalized to the _METHOD_ intensity of the corresponding _LOCATION_ fraction of each coat component . with the same approach we quantified the recruitment of _PROTEIN_ on _LOCATION_ in the presence of _PROTEIN_ using a _METHOD_ fusion of the component _METHOD_ . as shown in figure b and d the values of relative _METHOD_ intensity of punctate structures in cells coexpressing the _PROTEIN_ with either _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ were significantly higher than those gathered in the respective control cells . these data provide evidence that _PROTEIN_ is involved in the recruitment of _PROTEIN_ to _LOCATION_ as it does for _PROTEIN_ . to confirm that the distribution of _PROTEIN_ on _LOCATION_ was dependent on _PROTEIN_ activation leaf epidermal cells coexpressing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were treated with brefeldin a which is known to interfere with _PROTEIN_ activation . we then followed the distribution of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ over time . if active _PROTEIN_ is involved in the _LOCATION_ recruitment of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ inactivation of _PROTEIN_ would lead to redistribution of _PROTEIN_ into the _LOCATION_ . a time course showed that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were released into the _LOCATION_ at the same time upon treatment of cells with the inhibitor . this effect did not occur in the control samples without bfa indicating that our data were not the result of photobleaching during the course of the experiment . these data imply that the inactivation of _PROTEIN_ is associated with the release of _PROTEIN_ from _LOCATION_ . although the data presented above indicate that _PROTEIN_ is involved in the distribution of _PROTEIN_ on the _LOCATION_ where _PROTEIN_ resides they do not distinguish whether the interaction of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is direct or mediated by other _PROTEIN_ . to test this we developed a glutathione agarose affinity chromatography assay based on the interaction of a recombinant glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with recombinant arf protein . we used extracts of escherichia coli _PROTEIN_ fusions of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the gdp locked mutant and loaded them on glutathione columns that had been preloaded with extracts of e. coli _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . eluates of the columns were subjected to immunoblot analysis with either anti or anti _PROTEIN_ serum . the chemiluminescence signal was acquired on the same _LOCATION_ with a short exposure and long exposure to allow comparison of the signals without oversaturating pixels and compromising a clear detection of weak signals . results indicate that there is an interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ however there was preferential association of _PROTEIN_ with the wild type and _PROTEIN_ locked _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ of the arf proteins was tested by western blot on a fraction of total e. coli extracts to verify that similar quantities of _PROTEIN_ wild type _PROTEIN_ and gdp were loaded on the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ columns . as the _PROTEIN_ cycle of the wild type _PROTEIN_ prevents us from knowing whether _PROTEIN_ in figure was in the active or inactive form we decided to use nonhydrolyzable analogs of _PROTEIN_ and gdp thus ensuring that the results were independent of the mutations . wild type _PROTEIN_ was charged with either _PROTEIN_ or and the interaction with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was tested . _PROTEIN_ was retained by immobilized _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with and without exogenous _PROTEIN_ and gdp . similar to figure the gdp loaded _PROTEIN_ had a _PROTEIN_ affinity for the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the column loaded with _PROTEIN_ alone did not retain any _PROTEIN_ protein in either experiment under either exposure length . anti _PROTEIN_ immunoblots demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ were present in the column in comparable quantities . these data demonstrate that the association of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ occurs preferentially with active _PROTEIN_ therefore supporting our microscopy data on the recruitment and release of _PROTEIN_ from _LOCATION_ in the presence of either active or inactive _PROTEIN_ respectively . they also prove that the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ is due to a direct association of the two molecules . the _LOCATION_ dissociation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ induced by bfa suggests that the association of _PROTEIN_ on _LOCATION_ is not stable . therefore to characterize further the kinetics of _PROTEIN_ on _LOCATION_ we performed _METHOD_ recovery after photobleaching experiments on the punctate structures labeled by _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . photobleaching of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was followed by a rapid recovery of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ on the _LOCATION_ confirming that _PROTEIN_ does not associate stably with _LOCATION_ . to substantiate that the kinetics of the _LOCATION_ on _LOCATION_ are dependent on _PROTEIN_ we performed frap experiments on _LOCATION_ labeled with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . frap experiments were conducted with the assumption that to _PROTEIN_ steady state _METHOD_ levels there must be an equal continual loss of protein from the bleached organelle if the chimeric protein levels on the organelle _LOCATION_ had reached a steady state at the start of each experiment . therefore we hypothesized that if the cycling of _PROTEIN_ on and off _LOCATION_ is dependent on the cyclic activation/inactivation of _PROTEIN_ the presence of the active mutant form of _PROTEIN_ in cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ would reduce the dynamic exchange of the organelle associated _PROTEIN_ fraction with its _LOCATION_ pool . consistent with our hypothesis we found that the cycling of the _LOCATION_ was affected by the presence of the _PROTEIN_ mutant as the recovery of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was significantly reduced in cells coexpressing _PROTEIN_ in comparison to the control . these data indicate not only that the activation of _PROTEIN_ is necessary for the binding of _PROTEIN_ to _LOCATION_ but they also show that its dynamic cycle is dependent on the efficiency of _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis of _PROTEIN_ . it has been shown that _PROTEIN_ and coatomer cycle at different rates on and off _LOCATION_ . the identification of _PROTEIN_ as an effector of _PROTEIN_ prompted us to determine whether _PROTEIN_ undergoes cycling on and off _LOCATION_ with similar dynamics to _PROTEIN_ . frap experiments confirmed that both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and its effector _METHOD_ were found to cycle with different kinetics in accordance with previous findings . however we found no significant difference between the rate of _METHOD_ recovery for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ indicating that these two proteins cycle with the same kinetics . in addition both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labeling the extra _LOCATION_ punctate structures cycle at the same rate as the _LOCATION_ localized _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . however the exchange of _PROTEIN_ on _LOCATION_ was significantly slower than that of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . these data indicate that although coatomer and _PROTEIN_ are both recruited by _PROTEIN_ on _LOCATION_ the binding cycles of the two molecules are differentially regulated . because _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ have different cycling half times we postulated that inactivation of _PROTEIN_ could be one possible mechanism regulating the differential release of the effectors into the _LOCATION_ . to test this hypothesis we first treated cells cotransformed with _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with bfa . this allowed a comparison with the bfa treatment of cells coexpressing _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . a time course following _METHOD_ intensity shows that upon the addition of bfa _METHOD_ is redistributed to the _LOCATION_ before _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . this was interesting as it was in clear contrast to what was observed in figure where _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were released from _LOCATION_ at the same time . as a control a time course of images taken with the same settings on untreated cells transformed with both markers did not show significant reduction of _METHOD_ levels therefore excluding the possibility that our results were due to photobleaching during the imaging process . taken together the results indicate that distribution on _LOCATION_ was affected by the bfa treatment before _PROTEIN_ suggesting that the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and its effectors is regulated at a level specific to the effector rather than the _PROTEIN_ . to confirm this we treated cells cotransformed with _METHOD_ and cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ with bfa . this allowed us to follow the release of both effectors from the same _LOCATION_ simultaneously . a time course following _METHOD_ intensity shows that upon addition of bfa coatomer _METHOD_ was quickly released from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . although the _LOCATION_ associated _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ diminished over time _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ residual _METHOD_ was nonetheless still detectable on the _LOCATION_ after _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was redistributed into the _LOCATION_ . quantification of the _METHOD_ intensities of a time course of images taken from a control sample without bfa demonstrated that our results were not due to photobleaching . our data are consistent with the findings that the release of _PROTEIN_ from _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ occurs at the same time as the redistribution of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ but with different kinetics to coatomer . this suggests that additional _METHOD_ are involved in the activity of _PROTEIN_ ligand interactions besides the direct recruitment of effectors by _PROTEIN_ on _LOCATION_ .
