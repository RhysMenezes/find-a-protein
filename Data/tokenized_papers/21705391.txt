the voltage dependent anion channel a major outer mitochondrial _LOCATION_ protein is thought to play an important role in energy production and apoptotic cell death in mammalian _METHOD_ . however the function of vdacs in plants is largely unknown . in order to determine the individual function of plant vdacs molecular and genetic analysis was performed on four vdac genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ found in arabidopsis thaliana . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ possess the eukaryotic mitochondrial porin signature _PROTEIN_ in their c termini while _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ do not . localization analysis of vdac green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusions and their chimeric or mutated derivatives revealed that the _PROTEIN_ sequence is important for mitochondrial localization . through the functional analysis of vdac knockout mutants due to t dna insertion _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which are _PROTEIN_ in the whole plant body are important for various physiological functions such as leaf development the steady state of the mitochondrial _LOCATION_ potential and pollen development . moreover it was demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ is not only necessary for normal growth but also important for disease resistance through regulation of hydrogen peroxide generation .
five arabidopsis vdac _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which exhibit high identity can be extracted from the genbank database . vdacs are known as strand rich proteins . using the forte program the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ proteins were like human vdacs predicted to contain transmembrane strand domains . _PROTEIN_ is assumed to encode the truncated protein that lacks the sixth to ninth tm domains . the eukaryotic _PROTEIN_ found in vdacs is positioned in the tm domains . of the five arabidopsis vdacs _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ contain the canonical _PROTEIN_ motif in their c terminal region whereas _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ contain divergent _PROTEIN_ sequences . the next step was to try detect the vdac transcripts from a. thaliana accession col . of the five vdac genes it was not possible to isolate a sequence identical to the _PROTEIN_ sequence published in the public database . the fragments amplified from reverse transcribed cdnas were three kinds of splicing variants of _PROTEIN_ and their deduced amino acid sequences were truncated . it was thus assumed that _PROTEIN_ is a pseudo gene . henceforth all of the vdac genes present in arabidopsis were characterized excluding _PROTEIN_ . the subcellular localization of arabidopsis vdacs in plant cells was examined using constructs consisting of _METHOD_ fused to the c terminal regions of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . these vdac _METHOD_ fusion constructs were delivered into onion epidermal cells by particle bombardment or into protoplasts prepared from arabidopsis leaves by peg treatment . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were exclusively detected in mitochondria . in contrast the green _METHOD_ signals of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were detected not only in mitochondria but also in another subcellular area . the mitochondrial targeting of the vdac _METHOD_ constructs was confirmed by a mitochondria localized _METHOD_ fusion protein consisting of the truncated subunit and intact _METHOD_ mcherry protein delivered into onion epidermal cells . as previously mentioned _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ contain the conserved _PROTEIN_ sequence in their c termini whereas _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ do not . it was assumed that the canonical _PROTEIN_ sequence is important for strict targeting to mitochondria . to test this possibility the following constructs were generated the _PROTEIN_ regions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were named and respectively and the of _PROTEIN_ was replaced with resulting in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . conversely the of _PROTEIN_ was replaced with resulting in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the chimeric constructs were similarly introduced into arabidopsis protoplasts . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was observed in a pattern similar to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ whereas _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized primarily to mitochondria as did _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . next experiments were carried out to try to establish whether a specific amino acid residue of determines the strict mitochondrial localization of _PROTEIN_ . based on a comparison of the conserved _PROTEIN_ sequences with those of and it was hypothesized that the proline at amino acid position of is a possible candidate residue for determining mitochondrial localization . the corresponding residue of is histidine . thus a construct that encoded _PROTEIN_ with the specific residue at position _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and one that encoded _PROTEIN_ with the specific residue at position _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were generated by means of site directed mutagenesis . as expected _PROTEIN_ had the properties of _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ of cellular localization whereas _PROTEIN_ localized primarily to mitochondria as did _PROTEIN_ . subcellular

_PROTEIN_ the region of _PROTEIN_ was replaced with the region of _PROTEIN_ . in _PROTEIN_ the region of _PROTEIN_ was replaced with . subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ derivatives

_METHOD_ middle _METHOD_ emitted by chlorophyll right merged _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ images . bars . as a step toward determining the functional sites of the four vdac genes in planta transgenic arabidopsis plants carrying the respective vdac promoter gus constructs were generated and the spatiotemporal _PROTEIN_ pattern of the reporter gene was evaluated . the _PROTEIN_ promoter was active in shoot _METHOD_ and the surrounding regions corresponding to the root meristematic zone but not in root caps _PROTEIN_ roots the entire leaf area and the stigma and anthers . the activity of the _PROTEIN_ promoter was constitutively elevated in the above ground parts of the plant and in the root tips and steles . the activity was detected in whole leaves of the plants which had developed further and in whole flower organs including sepals . _PROTEIN_ promoter activity was scarcely detected in leaves except for the leaf tips and rather strong activity was detected in the anthers and stigma . the _PROTEIN_ promoter was constitutively active in whole seedlings and in almost all organs . histochemical localization of gus activity in transgenic arabidopsis plants containing _PROTEIN_

_PROTEIN_ and one of _PROTEIN_ were investigated . of these five lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were obtained as homozygotes whereas _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were only obtained as heterozygotes . the level of the respective vdac transcripts in the homozygous t dna insertion mutant plant was measured by rt pcr using primer pairs which correspond to the region of the t dna insertion sites and which span the t dna insertion sites respectively . vdac transcripts were detected when the side primer pairs were used but null or reduced levels of the transcripts were detected when the primers spanning the t dna insertion sites were used . moreover the rna _PROTEIN_ levels were quantified using the side primers of t dna insertions by quantitative real time pcr . _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was totally suppressed in _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ plants and _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to or in _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ respectively compared with that of the wt

growth rates of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are comparable with those of the wt but interestingly two of the mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ exhibited retarded growth rates and had a miniature phenotype compared with the wt throughout development . in addition both mutants _PROTEIN_ showed a lesion mimic phenotype . furthermore up regulation of the pathogenesis related genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was observed in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but not in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ under normal conditions . vdac is known as an outer mitochondrial _LOCATION_ component of the permeability transition _PROTEIN_ pore and the _PROTEIN_ pore participates in the regulation of the mitochondrial _LOCATION_ potential _PROTEIN_ . to establish why these mutant plants exhibited diverse phenotypes the _PROTEIN_ of the protoplasts prepared from the mutant plants was examined using . in all of the vdac mutants tested the _PROTEIN_ values were lower _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ than those of the wt . loss of function of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ resulted in a greater loss of _PROTEIN_ values than did loss of function of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . detection of mitochondrial _LOCATION_

and _PROTEIN_ did not result in a _PROTEIN_ genotype in the progeny _PROTEIN_ . in _PROTEIN_ the t dna was inserted in the most distal region of _PROTEIN_ of all the insertion mutants tested and the homozygous _PROTEIN_ line could set seeds in siliques that were slender compared with those of the wt . moreover the pollen germination rate of _PROTEIN_ was lower compared with the wt and germinated pollen tube length was also affected in _PROTEIN_ . apparently _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ did not show any growth retardation compared with the wt whereas _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ grew at half the rate taking at least a few weeks more to reach the flowering stage . the siliques of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ homozygous lines were short compared with those of the wt but they did not set fertile seeds . anther maturation in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ homozygous lines appeared to be disturbed and their anthers contained fewer pollen grains than those of the wt . furthermore the germination rate of pollen obtained from _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was reduced about one eighth and germinated pollen tubes were also drastically shorter than those of the wt . segregation analysis of _PROTEIN_ mutations

mutant seeds relative to that of col was displayed . to examine the relationship between vdac function and defence activity against the bacterial pathogen pst the _PROTEIN_ profiles of vdac genes during pathogen infection were analysed using quantitative rt pcr . all four vdac members were up regulated upon infection with the bacterial pathogen . the relative transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were enhanced to a greater degree when plants were infected with the avirulence pathogen pst than with the virulence pathogen pst . next the growth of pst and its derivative pst was tested in the vdac loss of function mutant plants . here two mutant plants were used _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ since the other two mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were too small to infiltrate with the bacterial solution and constitutively _PROTEIN_ pr genes . the host defence activity against pst but not against pst was compromised in _PROTEIN_ plants compared with control plants at h post inoculation . this phenomenon was not observed in _PROTEIN_ plants . this result indicates that _PROTEIN_ is involved in plant defence against the avirulence pathogen pst . next the production of in _PROTEIN_ plants upon pst infection was compared with that in the pathogen infected wt . the amount of in _PROTEIN_ plants was less than half of that produced by the wt at h post inoculation . when arabidopsis wt plants were _PROTEIN_ with pst the hr was induced and cell death was observed around the inoculation sites . therefore experiments were carried out to examine whether similar cell death occurred when _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ leaves were infiltrated with pst . while cell death was observed in the majority of wt leaves by h post bacterial inoculation cell death was seldom observed in _PROTEIN_ plants at the same time points . in the wt leaves exhibited clear cell death leaves exhibited weak cell death and two leaves showed no cell death _METHOD_ . the corresponding ratio in _PROTEIN_ was six to to . in contrast this phenomenon was not observed in _PROTEIN_ plants . these findings suggest that the loss of function of _PROTEIN_ suppresses the activation of cell death .
