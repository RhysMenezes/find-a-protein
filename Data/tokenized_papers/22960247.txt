ubiquitin dependent proteolysis regulates multiple aspects of plant growth and development but little is known about its role in ambient temperature responsive flowering . in addition to being regulated by daylength the onset of flowering in many plants can also be delayed by low ambient temperatures . here we show that high _PROTEIN_ of osmotically responsive genes _PROTEIN_ which encodes an ubiquitin ligase controls flowering time in response to ambient temperatures and intermittent cold . _PROTEIN_ mutants flowered early and were insensitive to ambient temperature but responded normally to vernalization and gibberellic acid . genetic analyses suggested that this ambient temperature insensitive flowering was independent of flowering locus c _PROTEIN_ . also flowering locus t _PROTEIN_ and twin _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was up regulated in _PROTEIN_ mutants at both temperatures . the ft tsf mutation almost completely suppressed the early flowering of _PROTEIN_ mutants at different temperatures suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are downstream of _PROTEIN_ in the ambient temperature response . a lesion in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ did not affect the ambient temperature insensitive flowering phenotype of _PROTEIN_ mutants . in silico analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ was spatiotemporally co _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ . a _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion co localized with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ at both and . _PROTEIN_ physically interacted with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in yeast two hybrid and co immunoprecipitation assays . moreover _PROTEIN_ mutants were insensitive to intermittent cold . collectively our results suggest that _PROTEIN_ acts as a common regulator in the signaling pathways that control flowering time in response to low ambient temperature .
to find regulators of the response to ambient temperatures we examined the flowering phenotypes of known flowering time mutants at different ambient growth temperatures as described in our earlier study . we measured the time of flowering as the number of leaves present at bolting and compared this number at two ambient temperatures and . we found that _PROTEIN_ mutants in the _PROTEIN_ background exhibited an early flowering phenotype that was not substantially altered at different ambient temperatures under _PROTEIN_ conditions _PROTEIN_ indicating that the flowering of _PROTEIN_ mutants was non responsive to different ambient temperatures . as the _PROTEIN_ ecotype is considered to have a weak _PROTEIN_ allele and it has not been widely used for genetic interaction studies we chose to study a t dna allele of _PROTEIN_ in the columbia background . we identified _PROTEIN_ which contains a single t dna insertion in the fifth exon of the _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ . quantitative reverse transcription pcr analyses showed that _PROTEIN_ mrna was nearly absent in the homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutants suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is a strong loss of function mutation . flowering time measurements at different ambient temperatures revealed that _PROTEIN_ mutants showed an early flowering phenotype at both and under _PROTEIN_ conditions similar to that of _PROTEIN_ mutants . these observations indicated that the ambient temperature insensitive flowering phenotype of _PROTEIN_ mutants that we observed was not allele specific . other than the flowering time phenotype there were no apparent defects in the overall morphology and architecture of vegetative and reproductive organs from _PROTEIN_ mutants when grown under _PROTEIN_ conditions at . since most flowering time mutants generally respond to a low ambient temperature we chose to study the flowering phenotype of _PROTEIN_ mutants in response to this low ambient temperature . we examined the spatial _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ in both the shoot apex which is the site of floral primordium emergence and the leaf which is the site of the initial perception of photoperiodic conditions of wild type plants . qpcr analysis revealed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was not significantly altered in the leaf and shoot apex regions at the different temperatures tested . in contrast the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ two temperature responsive genes were significantly higher and lower respectively at indicating that _PROTEIN_ mrna levels were not altered at different ambient temperatures . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under various floral inductive stimuli was also investigated to determine the mechanism by which _PROTEIN_ regulates flowering time . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in wild type plants remained unaltered by vernalization treatment whereas the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ which is an important integrator gene within the vernalization pathway _PROTEIN_ . similarly gibberellic acid treatment did not change _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels in wild type plants whereas it did increase the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ a gibberellic acid responsive gene during floral induction . this analysis indicates that _PROTEIN_ mrna _PROTEIN_ was not altered by vernalization or gibberellic acid treatment . the response of _PROTEIN_ plants to vernalization and gibberellic acid treatments was similar to that of wild type plants . both the vernalization and gibberellic acid treatments accelerated flowering in the _PROTEIN_ mutants to a similar extent demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ mutants responded to the vernalization and gibberellic acid treatments . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is unlikely to be regulated by the vernalization and gibberellic acid pathways which is consistent with a recent finding by citation and support the notion that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ functions in ambient temperature responsive flowering . the near absence of any effect of ambient temperatures on the early flowering phenotype of _PROTEIN_ plants led us to examine the _PROTEIN_ of flowering time genes in _PROTEIN_ plants grown at and under _PROTEIN_ conditions . the results of the qpcr analysis indicated that the _PROTEIN_ of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which are direct targets of _PROTEIN_ was up regulated in _PROTEIN_ mutants at both temperatures while the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ another downstream target of _PROTEIN_ was only marginally up regulated . the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which are important regulators of _PROTEIN_ in the autonomous pathway did not change . because _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes were known to act in ambient temperature responsive flowering we analyzed their _PROTEIN_ levels in _PROTEIN_ mutants . no significant alteration in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and pri _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was observed in _PROTEIN_ mutants . in addition the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were not affected by _PROTEIN_ mutation . collectively these results suggest that the early flowering phenotype of _PROTEIN_ plants at both and is likely to be due to the combined action of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . to determine whether the reduced _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ is the _PROTEIN_ cause of the temperature insensitive early flowering phenotype of _PROTEIN_ mutants we examined _PROTEIN_ flc double mutants . we compared the flowering time of _PROTEIN_ flc double mutants with that of _PROTEIN_ single mutants at and under _PROTEIN_ conditions . the _PROTEIN_ flc double mutants flowered earlier than either of the parental single mutants at suggesting that _PROTEIN_ least parallel with _PROTEIN_ in regulating flowering time . interestingly the responsiveness of _PROTEIN_ flc double mutants to ambient temperature was similar to that of _PROTEIN_ mutants which is in sharp contrast to the normal responsiveness of flc mutants to different ambient temperatures indicating that the flc mutation did not affect the ambient temperature insensitive flowering of the _PROTEIN_ mutants . this suggests that the ambient temperature insensitive flowering of _PROTEIN_ plants is genetically independent of _PROTEIN_ . because the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the output genes within the thermosensory pathway were up regulated in _PROTEIN_ mutants we examined the genetic relationship between _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ ft double mutants flowered _PROTEIN_ than the _PROTEIN_ mutants at both and which indicates that the early flowering of the _PROTEIN_ mutants was partially suppressed by the ft mutation . interestingly the temperature response of the _PROTEIN_ ft double mutants was similar to that of the ft mutants which is consistent with a role for _PROTEIN_ downstream of the thermosensory pathway . in contrast the flowering times of the _PROTEIN_ tsf double mutants at the different ambient temperatures were almost identical similar to the response of _PROTEIN_ single mutants . this suggests that increased _PROTEIN_ activity by _PROTEIN_ mutation causes the ambient temperature insensitivity of _PROTEIN_ tsf double mutants because the flowering phenotype of tsf single mutants was similar to that of wild type plants at different temperatures . lesions in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes strongly but not completely delayed the flowering of _PROTEIN_ mutants at and _PROTEIN_ . furthermore the temperature response of the _PROTEIN_ ft tsf triple mutants was similar to that of the ft tsf double mutants . the strong suppression of the flowering time phenotype of _PROTEIN_ mutants by ft and tsf mutations at different temperatures suggests that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are downstream of _PROTEIN_ in ambient temperature responsive flowering . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was investigated in _PROTEIN_ flc double mutants to determine the effect of the _PROTEIN_ mutation on _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ when _PROTEIN_ activity is absent . the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were increased in _PROTEIN_ single mutants at both temperatures . the increase in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was stronger in _PROTEIN_ mutants than in flc mutants suggesting that _PROTEIN_ exerts a stronger effect on _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ than on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in particular an additive increase in the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was clearly seen in _PROTEIN_ flc double mutants at both and . taken together with the genetic analysis this result supports the notion that _PROTEIN_ regulates _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ at least in part in an _PROTEIN_ independent manner for the regulation of ambient temperature responsive flowering . because some autonomous pathway mutants showed ambient temperature insensitive flowering we also tested the genetic interactions among _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ by crossing _PROTEIN_ mutants with fve or flk mutants . the _PROTEIN_ fve double mutants flowered with and leaves at and respectively . the number of leaves produced in _PROTEIN_ flk double mutants was lower than that produced in flk mutants . however the temperature responses of two double mutants were similar to those of their parental lines . this result indicated that _PROTEIN_ mutation strongly but not completely suppressed the _PROTEIN_ flowering of fve and flk mutants at both temperatures and further suggested that _PROTEIN_ acts in a genetic pathway with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to control ambient temperature responsive flowering . it was recently shown that _PROTEIN_ regulates _PROTEIN_ activity in the photoperiodic control of flowering . _PROTEIN_ is also known to be a direct activator of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . thus to test the effect of _PROTEIN_ on ambient temperature responsive flowering we investigated the flowering phenotype of _PROTEIN_ co double mutants at and under _PROTEIN_ conditions . _PROTEIN_ co double mutants flowered with and leaves at and respectively indicating that flowering of _PROTEIN_ co double mutants was apparently accelerated at . thus flowering of _PROTEIN_ co double mutants was almost ambient temperature insensitive as similarly seen in _PROTEIN_ mutants . in contrast co mutants showed ambient temperature responsive flowering . this indicated that the loss of _PROTEIN_ activity did not alter the ambient temperature insensitive flowering phenotype of _PROTEIN_ mutants . _PROTEIN_ analysis to test the effect of the co mutation on _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ up regulation in _PROTEIN_ co double mutants revealed that _PROTEIN_ mutation caused an increase in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and a _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the co mutant background at both temperatures . collectively these results suggested that a lesion in _PROTEIN_ does not alter the effect of _PROTEIN_ on ambient temperature responsive flowering . protein protein interactions between ub ligases and their respective proteins targeted for degradation require co _PROTEIN_ in both time and space for the formation of a protein complex . we searched a public microarray database for genes that showed spatial and temporal co _PROTEIN_ patterns with _PROTEIN_ and identified genes . subsequent comparison of their _PROTEIN_ patterns with known flowering time genes led to the identification of _PROTEIN_ . to confirm co localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the subcellular localization patterns of _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were examined in onion epidermal cells incubated at and . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized in both the cytoplasm and the _LOCATION_ at and . this subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ at provides an explanation for the reduced level of _PROTEIN_ protein observed at warm temperatures by citation . at _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was predominantly localized in the _LOCATION_ consistent with an earlier observation . in contrast _PROTEIN_ protein was located in the _LOCATION_ at all of the temperatures examined . it can therefore be concluded that the subcellular localization patterns of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins overlap at both and . the co localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ suggested the possibility that _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ . a yeast two hybrid assay was therefore performed to test whether _PROTEIN_ protein does interact with _PROTEIN_ . positive galactosidase activity was observed when _PROTEIN_ protein as bait was combined with _PROTEIN_ protein as prey . galactosidase activity was also observed when _PROTEIN_ which is known to interact with _PROTEIN_ protein was used as a positive control . in contrast galactosidase activity was not observed when the negative control bait was used . the results of this assay demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ can interact with _PROTEIN_ in this yeast two hybrid assay . since _PROTEIN_ functions within the autonomous pathway and its loss of function allele showed a similar flowering phenotype of insensitivity to ambient temperature changes we extended the yeast two hybrid assay using proteins that act in the autonomous pathway . among the autonomous pathway proteins we found that _PROTEIN_ protein also interacted with _PROTEIN_ whereas _PROTEIN_ protein did not . to confirm the yeast two hybrid assay and test whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins directly interact in vivo a reciprocal co immunoprecipitation analysis was performed using _PROTEIN_ hemagglutinin and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins . _PROTEIN_ ha was transiently _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs in arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts . protein extract was first immunoprecipitated with anti _METHOD_ antibody and then the precipitated proteins were analyzed by western blot using the anti ha antibody and vice versa . a band with the expected size of the _PROTEIN_ ha protein was detected from the anti _METHOD_ immunoprecipitates . the in vivo interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ was also revealed in the anti ha immunoprecipitates . however no band was observed from the anti _METHOD_ or anti ha immunoprecipitates when only one construct was _PROTEIN_ . taken together with the genetic analysis these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ protein physically interacts with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to control ambient temperature responsive flowering . the results of our experiments suggest that _PROTEIN_ is involved in ambient temperature responsive flowering which is in accordance with previous reports that _PROTEIN_ functions in the cold response . to test the possibility that _PROTEIN_ also acts in the intermittent cold response we exposed _PROTEIN_ mutants to for h each day just after dawn and measured flowering time . interestingly _PROTEIN_ mutants showed an almost identical flowering time whether or not they had been exposed to intermittent cold suggesting that _PROTEIN_ mutants do not respond to intermittent cold . in addition the flowering time of fve and flk mutants that were exposed to intermittent cold was almost identical to that of the control plants which had not been exposed to intermittent cold . however mutants of _PROTEIN_ which encodes a protein that did not interact with _PROTEIN_ protein showed delayed flowering time with intermittent cold indicating that fld mutants do respond to intermittent cold . these data suggest that the loss of function alleles of _PROTEIN_ and its interacting partners do not respond to intermittent cold . a qrcr analysis revealed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was significantly increased by intermittent cold . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the positive control genes that play an important role in the cold response are also up regulated by exposure to intermittent cold . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ increased and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in response to intermittent cold but the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ did not change dramatically . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ mrna _PROTEIN_ is regulated by intermittent cold .
