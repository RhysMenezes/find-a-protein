light is the ultimate source of energy for photosynthesis however excessive light leads to photooxidative damage and hence reduced photosynthetic efficiency especially when combined with other abiotic stresses . although the photosystem ii reaction center protein is the primary target of photooxidative damage other psii core proteins are also damaged and degraded . however it is still largely unknown whether degradation of and other psii proteins involves previously uncharacterized proteases . here we show that _PROTEIN_ is peripherally associated with the stromal side of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and that _PROTEIN_ interacts directly with psii . our results show that _PROTEIN_ is involved in the primary cleavage of photodamaged and and that this activity is essential for its function in psii repair . the double mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed no obvious phenotypic differences under normal growth conditions but additive effects were observed under high light . these results suggest that deg proteases on both the stromal and luminal sides of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ are important for the efficient psii repair in arabidopsis .
_PROTEIN_ was predicted to be located in chloroplasts by loctree . to determine the subcellular localization the n terminal amino acids of _PROTEIN_ were fused to the n terminus of the synthetic _METHOD_ under the control of the promoter with a mutation . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins were transiently _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins was colocalized with the chloroplastic chlorophyll which is consistent with the signals observed when the _METHOD_ was fused to the transit peptide of _PROTEIN_ . when the targeting signals of the fibrillarin and _PROTEIN_ proteins from arabidopsis were fused to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signals were located in the _LOCATION_ and mitochondria respectively . thus these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is targeted to the chloroplast . next intact chloroplasts were isolated separated into chloroplast stroma and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fractions and then subjected to immunoblot analysis with a specific antibody against _PROTEIN_ . the purity of chloroplasts was confirmed by immunoblot analysis using the antibodies against the _LOCATION_ histone protein the mitochondrial protein the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ protein and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein lhcii . the identities of the different fractions were further verified by immunoblot analyses with the antibodies against the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein lhcii the peripheral protein _PROTEIN_ and the stromal protein _PROTEIN_ . to determine the localization of _PROTEIN_ polyclonal antiserum was raised and immunoblot analysis of chloroplast protein showed the specificity of the _PROTEIN_ antibody . we found that _PROTEIN_ is located in chloroplasts and that the majority of _PROTEIN_ is present in chloroplast stromal fractions . to further investigate whether _PROTEIN_ is a peripheral or an intrinsic _LOCATION_ protein the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were incubated with trypsin . protease digestion assays showed that _PROTEIN_ could be degraded by trypsin while the lumen protein psbo was protected from trypsin treatment . these results indicate that the _PROTEIN_ protein is a chloroplast stroma protein and is associated with the _LOCATION_ . next to examine the strength of _PROTEIN_ 's _LOCATION_ association we treated the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ with salts and chaotropic agents . washing the _LOCATION_ with m nacl did not release the _PROTEIN_ from the _LOCATION_ but _PROTEIN_ was barely detectable after washing the _LOCATION_ with m m or m urea . as a control we found that the integral _LOCATION_ protein was not released from the _LOCATION_ by such treatments . high light treatment increased the amount of _PROTEIN_ associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the levels of _PROTEIN_ in the stromal fractions remained almost unchanged after exposure to high light treatment . this may reflect an increased _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ after high light treatment . the increased association of _PROTEIN_ with the _LOCATION_ suggested that it might function in the degradation of photosynthetic proteins . to examine the proteolytic activity of the recombinant his tagged _PROTEIN_ we incubated it with a mixture of and _METHOD_ of casein . casein is the preferred substrate for assaying bacterial degp activity under in vitro conditions . casein was efficiently degraded by the fractions containing overexpressed _PROTEIN_ and the and _METHOD_ remained unchanged under our experimental conditions . more than of the casein was degraded within the first min . these results indicated that the recombinant _PROTEIN_ was proteolytically active . next we examined whether _PROTEIN_ is proteolytically active toward photosynthetic proteins . since the degp protease has been shown to degrade damaged or misfolded proteins the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ used in this experiment were first subjected to high light treatment for min at . treatment with high light causes irreversible oxidative protein damage which subsequently induces conformational changes in proteins making them vulnerable to proteolytic degradation . the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ isolated from leaves exposed to high light were treated with mmol edta to inhibit the endogenous ftsh proteases . they were then incubated with or without recombinant _PROTEIN_ in the dark at . in the absence of recombinant _PROTEIN_ the and protein levels remained unchanged and no degradation products were detected . however when recombinant _PROTEIN_ was added to isolated _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ the amounts of full length and proteins _PROTEIN_ with time and polypeptides of kd for kd for kd for and kd for were immunodetected using antibodies raised against the de loop of the protein protein protein and protein respectively . immunoblot analysis with anti cyt f anti lhcii anti _PROTEIN_ and anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies showed that the levels of these proteins remained almost constant in the presence of recombinant _PROTEIN_ . when the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were isolated from the plants that were not exposed to high light treatment the photosynthetic proteins were not degraded by recombinant _PROTEIN_ . the relative mole ratio of _PROTEIN_ and psii was estimated to be about using isolated psii and anti for calibration which showed a large excess of psii over protease . to determine the function of the pdz domains in regulating the proteolytic activities of _PROTEIN_ we _PROTEIN_ a series of _PROTEIN_ proteases that contain zero to two pdz domains in vitro . _PROTEIN_ of the presence of either one or two pdz domains in the truncated _PROTEIN_ protein the levels of psii core proteins and _PROTEIN_ and the specific degradation fragments of their corresponding proteins were not detected . when the truncated _PROTEIN_ without any pdz domains was incubated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ the amounts of not only psii core proteins and but also lhcii _PROTEIN_ cyt f and _PROTEIN_ were reduced . the proteolytic activity of _PROTEIN_ toward psii core proteins suggests that _PROTEIN_ is associated with psii . to test this possibility the _LOCATION_ protein complexes separated on a blue native gel were further subjected to denaturing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and immunoblot analysis using specific antibodies . our results showed that the _PROTEIN_ protein and psii complex comigrated on the gel . next pull down experiments were performed with recombinant _PROTEIN_ fused to an n terminal his tag . the purified his _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was incubated with n dodecyl d maltoside solubilized _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . after washing nickel nitrilotriacetic acid agarose _PROTEIN_ resin with buffer the bound proteins were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and examined by immunoblot analysis . the psii proteins and were detected when the his _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was used in the assay . in contrast the psi protein _PROTEIN_ the cyt protein cyt f and the _PROTEIN_ synthase protein _PROTEIN_ were not detected when the solubilized _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the resin were incubated in the presence or absence of his _PROTEIN_ . to study the in vivo function of _PROTEIN_ we obtained arabidopsis lines from the salk collection . the _PROTEIN_ mutant line contains a t dna insertion within the bp sequence downstream of the _PROTEIN_ codon and this was confirmed by pcr and subsequent sequencing of the amplified products . reverse transcription pcr analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene was not detectable . further immunoblot analyses revealed that _PROTEIN_ protein was not detectable in the _PROTEIN_ mutant and that the levels of _PROTEIN_ in the complemented plants were comparable to those in the wild type plants . when grown under mol light the growth rates of the _PROTEIN_ mutants were comparable to those of the wild type . chlorophyll _METHOD_ analysis showed that the maximal photochemical efficiency of psii was similar between the _PROTEIN_ plants and wild type plants . to examine the steady state levels of _LOCATION_ proteins immunoblot analyses were performed with antibodies raised against specific subunits of the photosynthetic protein complexes . our results showed that levels of the _LOCATION_ proteins including lhcii psbo and of psii _PROTEIN_ of psi cyt f of the cyt complex and _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ synthase were not altered in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and ftsh were also not changed in the mutant . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ is involved in photoinhibition and repair processes the fv/fm was measured in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants under high light illumination . in the absence of lincomycin within h of illumination at a light intensity of mol fv/fm declined in the wild type and mutant leaves to about and respectively of the dark _PROTEIN_ values . these results clearly demonstrate the increased photosensitivity of the mutants . in the presence of lincomycin the decline of fv/fm in the wild type leaves was more rapid and continued until fv/fm values approached about of the dark _PROTEIN_ values . interestingly in the presence of lincomycin the decline in fv/fm in the _PROTEIN_ mutants was similar to that observed in the wild type leaves during the same photoinhibitory light treatment . since lincomycin blocks the repair of psii by inhibiting de novo protein synthesis in the chloroplast these results suggest that the wild type and mutant leaves display similar rates of psii photoinhibition . to establish whether the high susceptibility of the _PROTEIN_ mutants to photoinhibition is related to psii protein turnover we analyzed the psii protein contents of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in the wild type and mutant plants under high light illumination in the presence of lincomycin . under high light illumination and in the presence of this inhibitor the levels of the psii proteins and gradually declined in the _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants but the rate of reduction was slower in the mutant . the levels of psbo another psii protein and the psi protein _PROTEIN_ were found to be relatively stable in both the wild type and mutant plants . next we performed an in vivo labeling experiment to follow the turnover of newly synthesized chloroplast proteins . our results showed that the synthesis rates of the psii core proteins and the psi reaction center proteins _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ synthase _PROTEIN_ / were similar between the wild type and mutant plants . the psii core proteins and showed increased stability in the mutant compared with the wild type plants . the protein synthesis rates in pulse labeling for min reflect the differences between the synthesis and degradation rates of photosynthetic proteins . thus the net synthesis rate of psii reaction center protein in the mutant was lower than that of the wild type since the rate of degradation was slowed in _PROTEIN_ . to further analyze the physiological function of _PROTEIN_ photoinhibition was carried out with isolated _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to which mmol edta had been added in order to inactivate the endogenous ftsh proteases . we found that the kd polypeptide of the kd polypeptide of the kd polypeptide of and the kd polypeptide of were detected in the samples from wild type plants following photoinhibition but not in samples from the _PROTEIN_ mutant . an kd polypeptide from was detected both in the wild type and mutant plants which may be due to the function of lumen localized _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . since _PROTEIN_ is involved in protection against photoinhibition we analyzed the phenotypes of the mutants during growth under high irradiance . for this purpose we transferred the wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants that were grown initially at mol to a greenhouse with a maximum intensity of mol at noon . our results showed that when exposed to high light the growth of the _PROTEIN_ mutant was inhibited compared with the wild type plants . three double mutants were constructed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to test the physiological importance of stromal and luminal deg proteases in photosynthesis . the growth rates and psii activities of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were comparable to those of wild type plants when grown at mol . however when exposed to high light the growth of the mutants was slower than that of the wild type plants and the extent of the phenotype in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants was more pronounced than in the single mutants while that of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was similar to that of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . moreover some of the mutant leaves exhibited _METHOD_ of yellowing in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants .
wild type and mutant arabidopsis plants were grown in soil under short day conditions with a photon flux density of mol at a constant temperature of . the t dna insertion line _PROTEIN_ was obtained from the t dna transformed arabidopsis collection from the arabidopsis biological resource center . homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant plants were identified by pcr analyses using the following gene specific and t dna specific primers lp rp and t dna lb . the precise location of the t dna insertion was determined by sequencing the pcr products . confirmation of null mutants was carried out by rt pcr using the same primer set described above for _PROTEIN_ . equal cdna loading in each sample was monitored by rt pcr analysis of the _PROTEIN_ level of actin _PROTEIN_ . the double mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were obtained by pcr screening of an population from crossed single mutant lines . the cdna containing the coding region of _PROTEIN_ was amplified with the following primers which include xhoi and kpni restriction sites at their ends to facilitate cloning sense primer and antisense primer . the resulting fragment was cloned into the sami and kpni sites of under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . the plasmid _PROTEIN_ was transformed into agrobacterium tumefaciens strain via electroporation and introduced into the homozygous _PROTEIN_ plants . transformant plants were selected on medium containing half strength murashige and skoog salt mix g hygromycin and agar . the resistant plants were transferred to soil to grow to maturity and their transgenic status was further confirmed by pcr and immunoblot analyses . detached mature leaves were floated adaxial side up on water and exposed to a photon flux density of mol and chlorophyll _METHOD_ was measured using a _PROTEIN_ fluorometer . the temperature of the water was kept at during photoinhibition treatments . synthesis of chloroplast encoded proteins was blocked by incubating detached leaves with their petioles submersed in mm lincomycin solution at an irradiance of mol for h prior to photoinhibitory light treatment . to investigate the effects of high irradiance on plant growth we transferred week old arabidopsis plants grown in a growth chamber under a photon flux density of mol to a greenhouse under sunlight illumination for another weeks . in the greenhouse the maximum photon flux density at noon was about mol and average day/night temperatures were . _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were isolated essentially as described by citation . briefly arabidopsis leaves were homogenized by a mortar and pestle in an ice cold isolation buffer filtered through two layers of cheesecloth and centrifuged at for min . the _LOCATION_ pellets were resuspended in the isolation buffer and then centrifuged at for min . the _LOCATION_ were finally suspended in isolation buffer and their chlorophyll levels were determined . the protein sample was mixed with the same volume of _PROTEIN_ sample buffer _PROTEIN_ for min and layered onto _PROTEIN_ polyacrylamide gels containing m urea . after electrophoresis gels were stained with _METHOD_ brilliant blue . for immunoblot analysis the proteins resolved by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were blotted onto nitrocellulose _LOCATION_ and reacted with specific antibodies and the signals were visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence method . primary antibodies used in this study were as follows a specific antibody against the oligopeptide nygykfgqe containing the amino acids to in the de loop of the protein of synechocystis species pcc a specific antibody against the oligopeptide ntfrafnptqaeetys containing the amino acids to in the de loop of the protein of arabidopsis an anti

of arabidopsis a _PROTEIN_ antibody raised against the amino acids to in the n terminus of the _PROTEIN_ protein of arabidopsis and a _PROTEIN_ antibody raised against the amino acids to in the c terminus of the _PROTEIN_ protein of arabidopsis . the his _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was purified on a ni _PROTEIN_ resin _PROTEIN_ and polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbit with the purified antigens . the intracellular localization of _PROTEIN_ was determined essentially according to citation . the arabidopsis _LOCATION_ were suspended to a final concentration of mg chlorophyll in mm hepes koh ph mm mm sorbitol and mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride supplemented with mm nacl mm m m urea and triton x at for min or mg trypsin at for min . _LOCATION_ fractions without supplements were used as a control . after treatment the _LOCATION_ were pelleted at for h at quickly washed with isolation buffer and used for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and immunoblot analysis . full length _PROTEIN_ cdna was cloned into the plasmid and transformed into cells . the _PROTEIN_ of the his _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was induced by isopropylthio d galactoside for h and the overexpressed protein was purified using a ni _PROTEIN_ resin _PROTEIN_ . the purified protein was renatured through a sephadex g column by eluting with mm ph buffer and the identity of the protein was confirmed by immunoblot analyses with specific antibodies . for protein pull down assays _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were solubilized with dm in glycerol mm bistris hcl ph and mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for min at then centrifuged at for min . the supernatant obtained after centrifugation was incubated with his _PROTEIN_ coupled to ni _PROTEIN_ resin . after incubation overnight with constant rotation at the beads were washed five times with mm tris hcl mm nacl and mm edta buffer and the bound proteins were eluted with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ sample buffer . the eluted proteins were resolved by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ followed by immunoblot analyses . the proteolytic activity was assayed by incubating _PROTEIN_ with g mixtures of casein in standard reaction mixtures including g of purified _PROTEIN_ in a l solution containing mm tris hcl ph . the mixtures were incubated for and min at separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and stained with _METHOD_ brilliant blue . for the in vitro degradation assay wild type arabidopsis

recombinant _PROTEIN_ or its derivatives and resuspended in mm sorbitol and mm hepes koh ph . after incubation of purified recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ at in the dark for various amounts of time the samples were subjected to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and immunoblot analyses . in vivo chloroplast protein labeling was carried out essentially according to citation . leaves of week old arabidopsis plants were preincubated for min in the presence of g cycloheximide which blocks the synthesis of _LOCATION_ encoded proteins . then the leaves were radiolabeled with ci met at
