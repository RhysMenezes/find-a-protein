the highly resistant biopolymer sporopollenin gives the outer wall of spores and pollen grains their unparalleled strength shielding these structures from terrestrial stresses . despite a limited understanding of the composition of sporopollenin it appears that the synthesis of sporopollenin occurs in the tapetum and requires the transport of one or more sporopollenin constituents to the surface of developing microspores . here we describe _PROTEIN_ a member of the _PROTEIN_ binding cassette transporter superfamily which is required for pollen exine formation in arabidopsis . _PROTEIN_ mutants are severely reduced in fertility with most siliques failing to produce seeds by self fertilization and mature anthers failing to release pollen . transmission electron microscopy analyses revealed an absence of an exine wall on _PROTEIN_ mutant microspores . phenotypic abnormalities in pollen wall formation were first apparent in early uninucleate microspores as a lack of exine formation and sporopollenin deposition . additionally the highest levels of _PROTEIN_ mrna were in the tapetum during early pollen wall formation sporopollenin biosynthesis and sporopollenin deposition . accumulations resembling the trilamellar lipidic coils in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants defective in cuticular wax export were observed in the anther locules of _PROTEIN_ mutants . a yellow _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ protein was localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . our results show that _PROTEIN_ plays a critical role in exine formation and pollen development and are consistent with a model by which _PROTEIN_ transports sporopollenin precursors across the tapetum _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ into the locule for polymerization on developing microspore walls .
to test the hypothesis that abc transporters are required for the export of sporopollenin precursors or other constituents of the exine from the tapetum to developing microspores it was necessary to identify candidate abc transporters out of the over annotated abc transporter genes in the arabidopsis genome . since _PROTEIN_ is preferentially _PROTEIN_ in the tapetum and encodes an acyl coa synthetase required for sporopollenin biosynthesis this gene was used for coexpression analysis to identify potential arabidopsis transporters on the prime database . the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gene _GENE_ shows a high coefficient of coexpression in the tissue and development version data set along with several other genes involved in sporopollenin biosynthesis . _PROTEIN_ encodes a predicted half size abc transporter in the g subfamily formerly called the white brown complex subfamily . the highly conserved protein architecture of _PROTEIN_ is typical of this subfamily where dimerization of two half transporters produces a functional transport unit with two transmembrane domains and two abc domains . to test a role for _PROTEIN_ in male fertility and pollen development three _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center . pcr genotyping identified plants homozygous for each _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion and sequencing confirmed insertion in the fifth exon _PROTEIN_ or the untranslated region _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . plants homozygous for each of the mutant alleles exhibited highly similar mutant phenotypes of severe impairment in male fertility and the _PROTEIN_ mutant was used for further experiments . reverse transcription pcr analysis revealed a strong reduction of _PROTEIN_ mrna in the _PROTEIN_ mutant relative to the wild type suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is a loss of function allele of _PROTEIN_ . in homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant plants most siliques failed to mature and produce seeds and most _PROTEIN_ anthers appeared brown dry and lacked any obvious pollen grains . however occasional _PROTEIN_ anthers with bulbous yellow surfaces consistent with pollen that was not shed were identified and occasional fully fertile siliques were observed suggesting a low rate of fertile pollen formation . wild type pollen applied to homozygous _PROTEIN_ stigmas on flowers with brown dry anthers produced fertile progeny demonstrating normal female fertility and strong male sterility of _PROTEIN_ . no other morphological differences between mature wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants were observed except that _PROTEIN_ mutant plants flowered for a longer time and grew taller . growth under elevated humidity did not recover fertility in _PROTEIN_ plants . to confirm that the observed male sterile phenotype is caused by the _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion mutation we cloned _PROTEIN_ cdna from developing flower buds in order to complement the _PROTEIN_ mutant with a wild type copy of _PROTEIN_ . however during the isolation of the expected annotated _PROTEIN_ cdna a second cdna transcript _PROTEIN_ was found and sequencing revealed that it corresponded to an alternatively spliced _PROTEIN_ variant resulting from the retention of intron in the transcript . the retention of intron which encodes multiple in frame stop codons is predicted to produce a truncated protein if it were translated . constructs containing either the major or minor splice variant of _PROTEIN_ cdna driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter were generated and transformed into the homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant line . the presence of each construct as well as the t dna insertion in the progeny of homozygous _PROTEIN_ plants was confirmed by pcr . figure shows the fertility phenotypes of progeny relative to those of wild type ecotype columbia and _PROTEIN_ plants assayed by silique development and seed set . although occasional fertile siliques were observed in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants very few fully developed siliques were observed and clear fertility differences were observed between multiple mutant and wild type individuals _PROTEIN_ . when assayed in a similar manner progeny from multiple lines _PROTEIN_ cdna for the major transcript _PROTEIN_ restored wild type fertility levels to the _PROTEIN_ mutant line with numerous fully developed siliques and normal seed set . wild type fertility levels were also restored in multiple lines _PROTEIN_ cdna for the minor transcript _PROTEIN_ which contains the retained intron . this could suggest that a truncated protein was functional surprising given the high conservation of abc transporter protein architecture . alternatively when the transcript with the retained intron was _PROTEIN_ functional protein could have been produced by splicing out of the retained intron with its premature stop codon . rt pcr was performed to assess whether the lines complemented with contained the full length or alternative transcripts . _PROTEIN_ transcript was detectable in such lines suggesting that complementation by the _PROTEIN_ construct was due to the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ mrna and _PROTEIN_ protein rather than by truncated _PROTEIN_ protein . to evaluate the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ we queried the genevestigator arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ database . results suggested _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ specifically in immature flower buds and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was absent from and agamous mutants that lack stamens suggesting a stamen specific _PROTEIN_ pattern . to confirm the flower specific _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ levels of both _PROTEIN_ splice variants were tested in various arabidopsis organs by quantitative rt pcr . these results revealed a highly flower preferred _PROTEIN_ pattern for both _PROTEIN_ splice variants with little or no transcripts detected in other organs . _PROTEIN_ is the major transcript and accumulates approximately fold higher relative to _PROTEIN_ . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in sporophytic or gametophytic tissues we used in situ hybridization . figure shows that _PROTEIN_ transcripts were transiently localized to tapetum cells in developing anthers . tapetum localized _PROTEIN_ was first observed at stage when microspore mother cells became apparent in locules . maximum _PROTEIN_ was observed at stages and corresponding to tetrad formation and free microspore release respectively and _PROTEIN_ declined at stages and and disappeared by stage in conjunction with tapetum degeneration . relative to the sense rna hybridization controls some _PROTEIN_ signal also appeared in developing microspores . the timing of tapetum localized _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is similar to that of _PROTEIN_ which encodes a key enzyme in sporopollenin biosynthesis and coincides with the onset of exine formation and sporopollenin biosynthesis suggesting that _PROTEIN_ could be involved in this process . to identify the stage at which pollen development is affected in the _PROTEIN_ mutant we used light microscopy to compare anther and microspore development in wild type and _PROTEIN_ flower buds using the stages defined by citation fig . . in all early stages including the completion of meiosis in stage both wild type and _PROTEIN_ microspore tetrads were encased by callose and appeared normal . however by stage characterized by the release of free microspores and formation of the exine wall _PROTEIN_ anthers differed significantly from the wild type . figure shows that free microspores in _PROTEIN_ exhibited signs of incipient degeneration . in stages to the degeneration of the tapetum and formation of tricellular mature pollen proceeded in wild type anthers while pollen grains in the _PROTEIN_ mutant generally lacked cytoplasm and exhibited misshapen morphologies . by stage all _PROTEIN_ mutant anthers observed in multiple sections were devoid of pollen grains while abundant mature pollen was evident in wild type anthers . despite impaired microspore development in _PROTEIN_ no additional changes in anther morphology were observed in the tapetum or integuments and growth and expansion proceeded as in wild type plants . these data suggest that impaired microspore development occurs in the _PROTEIN_ mutant at the developmental stage when sporopollenin deposition and exine formation normally occur . the observed degeneration of microspores at the time of pollen wall formation indicated that defects in pollen wall and exine formation could be the primary cause of pollen abortion and male infertility in _PROTEIN_ mutants . to examine pollen wall and tapetum morphology at higher resolution in the _PROTEIN_ mutant relative to wild type plants scanning electron microscopy _PROTEIN_ and tem were used . the surface of wild type pollen viewed with _PROTEIN_ exhibited a characteristic reticulate exine . in contrast _PROTEIN_ revealed that _PROTEIN_ anthers occasionally released small amounts of pollen or pollen like structures with smooth surfaces and collapsed morphology . this loss of normal pollen cell wall morphology and collapse of the microspores suggests a severe pollen wall defect but since occasional fully fertile siliques were observed in the mutant low numbers of fertile pollen grains were likely formed . since the sporopollenin based exine of pollen grains is deposited by stage of anther development the cell structure of the developing anthers and tapetum was examined using tem focusing on this stage . uninucleate microspores of chemically fixed _PROTEIN_ anthers at stage exhibited thin walls and apparently defective exine deposition as compared with wild type microspores that had pollen walls with a typical _PROTEIN_ reticulate exine . at higher magnification tectum and bacula structures of wild type exine deposited on the underlying nexine i were obvious in wild type microspores . in contrast walls of _PROTEIN_ microspores were devoid of baculae and tectum containing instead a thin amorphous defective wall layer . no differences in the tapetum of _PROTEIN_ anthers compared with wild type tapetum cells at the equivalent developmental stages were observed in chemically fixed material . interestingly coil shaped electron dense inclusions were consistently observed in _PROTEIN_ locules but were never observed in the locules of wild type anthers . from light microscopy analyses pollen development showed signs of disruption in _PROTEIN_ early free uninucleate microspores in coordination with the onset of exine formation . in the images obtained after chemical fixation however a clearly delineated primexine was not observed in wild type plants . to improve the ultrastructural preservation of microspores and facilitate high resolution imaging of both primexine and exine analysis in developing wild type and _PROTEIN_ microspores we used high pressure freezing and freeze substitution to preserve stamens during anther development . at stage both wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant microspore mother cells were surrounded by a uniform _PROTEIN_ between the microspore primary cell wall and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . by stage tetrads encased in callose were present in both the wild type and _PROTEIN_ and appeared identical showing primexine and probacula deposition between the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and callose wall . shortly after their release from tetrads at stage however _PROTEIN_ early uninucleate microspores failed to develop well defined baculae which were obvious in wild type microspores at the same stage . the nexine i layer in wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant anthers was observed as a faint electron translucent layer immediately outside the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in these hpf fixed specimens . at the _PROTEIN_ unicellular stage wild type microspores had a nearly complete pollen wall composed of nexine i bacula and tectum . however _PROTEIN_ microspores at the same stage lacked any defined bacula and tectum structure instead ill defined electron dense deposits were observed on the surface surrounding the nexine i layer . the absence of defects in primexine but visible defects in exine formation in the _PROTEIN_ mutant demonstrate that contributions of primexine from the microspore were not affected by _PROTEIN_ mutation while the deposition of tapetum derived sporopollenin was severely affected . no differences in _PROTEIN_ tapetum cell ultrastructure relative to wild type tapetum cells were observed in tem samples . in stages through wild type and _PROTEIN_ tapetum cells were binucleate cytoplasmically dense with numerous vesicles and contained no inclusions . however as initially observed in tem micrographs of chemically fixed anthers hpf fixed _PROTEIN_ anther locules after stage consistently contained electron dense inclusions that were never observed in wild type anther locules . these structures were often in the shape of _PROTEIN_ or flattened _PROTEIN_ and at higher magnification appeared as coils with two laminar surfaces . to test the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ we generated a yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ n terminal fusion under the control of a double promoter and used an arabidopsis protoplast transient _PROTEIN_ system to monitor _METHOD_ localization . such n terminal fusions to abcg transporters have been shown to retain activity . observation of multiple protoplasts _PROTEIN_ the construct showed differing levels of transgene _PROTEIN_ as monitored by ypf _METHOD_ . in protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at low levels _METHOD_ was localized to the periphery of protoplasts where it colocalized with a styrl dye known to insert in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in transformed protoplasts that _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ at higher levels _METHOD_ was also observed at the _LOCATION_ envelope and in transvacuolar strands in a pattern consistent with localization of some of the protein in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . when combined with the in situ hybridization data the predominantly _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization suggests that _PROTEIN_ functions at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of tapetum cells .

from the plants and homozygous individuals were identified using pcr and primers to for _PROTEIN_ to for _PROTEIN_ and to for _PROTEIN_ . to test _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels in the mutant _PROTEIN_

for min cycles of for s for s and for min and finally for min . the amplified genomic dna fragments from the homozygous lines were gel purified and sequenced to confirm the site of t dna insertion .
