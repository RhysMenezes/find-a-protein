enhancement of root hair development in response to phosphate deficit has been reported extensively . root hairs are involved in major root functions such as the absorption of water acquisition of nutrients and secretion of organic acids and enzymes . individual root hair cells _PROTEIN_ these functions and appropriate structure under various physiological conditions . we carried out a study to identify protein which _PROTEIN_ the structure and function of root hairs and identified a protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ that was induced in root hairs under pi deficient conditions . promoter assay and mrna quantification revealed that _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in root hairs and seeds . a knockout mutant srpp consistently displayed defects in root hairs and seeds . root hairs in srpp were short and the phenotypes observed under pi deficient conditions were also detected in ethylene treated srpp plants . propidium iodide stained most root hairs of srpp grown under pi deficient conditions suggesting cell death . in addition to root hairs most srpp seeds were withered and their embryos were dead . _PROTEIN_ tagged with green _METHOD_ protein was detected in the cell wall . electron microscopy showed abnormal morphology of the cell wall . wild type phenotypes were restored when the _PROTEIN_ gene was _PROTEIN_ in srpp . these data strongly suggest that _PROTEIN_ contributes to the construction of robust cell walls whereby it plays a key role in the development of root hairs and seeds .
the root hair less _PROTEIN_ line provides valuable information for identification of root hair specific components by comparison with the wild type roots because the _PROTEIN_ line _METHOD_ no root hairs under any conditions in any regions of the roots . we performed proteomic analysis of the crude _LOCATION_ fractions from the roots of the _PROTEIN_ line . proteomic profiles of col and _PROTEIN_ grown under standard and pi deficient conditions were compared . a protein with residues _PROTEIN_ was identified only in col under pi deficient conditions . the gene encoding this protein _PROTEIN_ has been reported as a root hair specific gene from the results of a microarray analysis . this study revealed that the _PROTEIN_ protein is present in root hairs and was increased markedly under pi deficient conditions . we also confirmed the induction of the transcriptional level of _PROTEIN_ by pi deficiency . _PROTEIN_ transcripts were increased about three times in no under pi deficient conditions . furthermore we _PROTEIN_ a construct containing _PROTEIN_ linked with _METHOD_ under the control of its own promoter . we observed roots of the generation by confocal laser scanning microscopy _PROTEIN_ and detected _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in root hairs only under pi deficient conditions . this observation is consistent with the results of the proteomic analysis and suggests that _PROTEIN_ may play a critical role under pi deficiency . _PROTEIN_ transcripts were detected clearly in roots and faintly in siliques of wild type plants . we further investigated the tissue specificity of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ using promoter gus analysis . gus _PROTEIN_ activity was detected in roots but not in shoots grown under normal conditions . in particular root tips and elongating regions of the primary and _PROTEIN_ roots showed high gus activity . a magnified view revealed high _PROTEIN_ in root hairs and collet hairs . furthermore plants cultivated under pi deficient conditions seemed to have higher gus activity in roots . next examination of reproductive organs revealed gus activity in fruits and anthers . the gus activity was detected in the pericarps and receptacles during maturation of siliques . then we stained fruits from which pericarps were removed and detected significant activity in the embryo funiculus and seed coat in siliques . for the embryonic stage the gus signal was detected from the initial globular to mature stages . in seed coats the signal was detected in the transparent inner integument . we also detected the gus activity in anthers and the gus signal in young anthers was found to be stronger than in mature anthers . no detection of _PROTEIN_ protein or green _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in plants grown under normal conditions is inconsistent with the observations of mrna quantification and promoter gus analysis . this may be due to a slow translation rate and/or rapid degradation of _PROTEIN_ under normal conditions . we characterized an _PROTEIN_ loss of function mutant to investigate the physiological roles of _PROTEIN_ . the srpp mutant line of arabidopsis thaliana has a transposon insertion in the first exon of _PROTEIN_ . we used srpp as a functionally defective mutant of _PROTEIN_ because no _PROTEIN_ transcripts were detected in this mutant plant . the mutant srpp grew normally and there was no difference in the primary root length or shoot fresh weight between no and srpp . also the srpp mutant grown under normal conditions showed no difference in the root hair length compared with no . in contrast to results found under normal conditions the length of primary roots of srpp was shorter than those of no when grown under pi deficient conditions for d . it is known that the number and length of root hairs in various plants are increased markedly under pi deficient conditions . under pi deficient conditions _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was increased and detected in root hairs as mentioned above . thus we assumed that _PROTEIN_ is involved in the physiological processes that promote the development and elongation of root hairs . then we compared the length of root hairs of no and srpp under pi deficient conditions . the root hair length reached a maximum at mm from the root tip in both lines . the average length of mature root hairs of no was mm . the srpp root hairs were shorter than the no root hairs . there was no marked difference in the distribution of root hair density . in addition to the less pronounced enhancement of root hair elongation in srpp bent and drooping root hairs were frequently observed at the upper regions of mm and farther from the root tip . for confirmation we introduced the _PROTEIN_ gene into the srpp background under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter . in five independent complementation lines under pi deficient conditions the root hair length primary root length and shoot fresh weight were recovered to the values of no . the number of bent or drooping root hairs in these complementation lines was also _PROTEIN_ . the results suggest that the phenotypes observed in srpp under pi deficient conditions were caused by the lack of a functional _PROTEIN_ gene . the above mentioned results led us to investigate which physiological elements of pi deficient conditions or emergent elongation of root hairs are related directly to the induction and role of _PROTEIN_ . if _PROTEIN_ is tightly related to the emergent elongation of root hairs the phenotype should be observed _PROTEIN_ of pi availability . therefore we attempted to compare the root hairs of no and srpp plants after ethylene treatment which is known to enhance the formation and elongation of root hairs . after ethylene treatment the length of mature root hairs of srpp was shorter than that of root hairs of no . furthermore most root hairs at the upper mm region from the root tip were bent a phenotype mimicking root hairs grown under pi deficient conditions . these results suggested that _PROTEIN_ is somehow involved in elongation and _PROTEIN_ of the structure of root hairs which are emergently elongated . roots of no and srpp were stained with propidium iodide _PROTEIN_ which is a _LOCATION_ impermeable _METHOD_ dye that is used for cell wall staining and that also allows the distinction between live and dead cells . roots and root hairs of both no and srpp were normal under pi sufficient conditions since only cell walls were _PROTEIN_ stained . while almost all the root hair cells of srpp absorbed the dye under pi deficient conditions most of the no root hair cells did not . this result indicated that necrosis occurs in root hairs of srpp under pi deficient conditions . careful observation of phenotype during the whole plant life cycle revealed that srpp seeds are dark brown and withered even when collected from plants cultivated under standard conditions . to gain further insights we observed srpp seeds using scanning electron microscopy _PROTEIN_ and found the following phenotypes the seeds were withered the seed surface was hollowed and the surface structure of polygonal epidermal cells was altered significantly . then we removed the seed coats and observed embryos . all embryos of no had a normal shape and almost equal size . in contrast embryos of withered srpp seeds were small and their size was variable while a fraction of srpp seeds were not withered and their embryos were comparable in size and shape with those of no . in addition cells of embryos were well stained with _PROTEIN_ indicating that most cells of the embryo died in the withered srpp seeds . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is required for normal embryonic development . furthermore the typical phenotypes of srpp seeds were clearly compensated for by introducing _PROTEIN_ . when no srpp and five complementation lines were cultivated side by side under the same conditions there were no withered seeds in complementation lines and . the ratios of withered seeds were < in and . together these results indicated that the withered seed phenotype was also due to the lack of _PROTEIN_ . seeds are composed of maternal tissues and new tissues made after fertilization . while the seed coat and pericarps are maternal tissues the embryo is a hybrid tissue . we analyzed characteristics of seeds obtained by cross breeding no and srpp to investigate the tissues in which _PROTEIN_ functions . if a seed phenotype depends directly on its mother it means that _PROTEIN_ plays a very important role in mother tissues and vice versa . we crossed no and srpp sowed the obtained seeds and estimated the germination rate . prior to evaluation we extracted the genomic dna from seedlings and confirmed that they were heterozygous for _PROTEIN_ . when no was used as the mother plant for crossing the average germination rate was . surprisingly when srpp was used as the mother plant the germination rate was . the above results indicated clearly that _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in maternal tissues is critical for seed formation . when the mother plant was no the germination rate was lower than that of no suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is important for seed formation even in the hybrid tissue of the embryo . as mentioned above we _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ linked with _METHOD_ under the control of its own promoter . we observed roots of the generation by _PROTEIN_ and detected _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in root hairs . additionally the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ introduced into srpp complemented the srpp phenotypes shown in root hairs and seeds . this indicates that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in plants shows normal functions . importantly the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was detected only under pi deficient conditions . the _METHOD_ was detected in cell walls or _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . after plasmolysis the signal was detected in part of the cell wall but not in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . also we detected the _METHOD_ in the cell wall of the basal part of the root hair at an early stage of elongation . although the _METHOD_ was not detected in the root hairs at the bulge forming stage the _METHOD_ was clearly detected in the basal and middle regions at the elongation stage . finally a clear signal was detected through the root hairs including the tips at the mature stage . the localization of _PROTEIN_ to the cell wall led us to examine the structure of the embryo cell wall in withered srpp seeds by transmission electron microscopy . while no embryos had well balanced polygons the cell walls in the srpp embryos were uneven and the cell shape was distorted . the cell wall of srpp was _PROTEIN_ than that of no and the structure of the cell wall was wavy . the cell wall showed marked hypertrophy especially at the point where three cells meet .

primers and a primer specific to the g edge of a transposon . the seeds were surface sterilized and sown on sterile gel plates containing half strength murashige and skoog _METHOD_ salt mixture mm mes koh sucrose and ina agar _METHOD_ . seed specimens were placed in darkness at for d and then moved to a growth chamber at under long day conditions . a modified culture medium of hoagland medium not supplemented with pi was prepared to evaluate the effect on the plant growth under pi deficient conditions . for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ construction the region at to of _PROTEIN_ was amplified from a.

functional line srpp . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were introduced into no . after selection with mg ml _PROTEIN_ or mg ml kanamycin multiple heterozygous or homozygous lines were used for each experiment . total rna fractions were prepared from week old plants and week old plants using a qia shredder and rneasy mini kit . rna was converted into cdna using a revertra ace qpcr rt
