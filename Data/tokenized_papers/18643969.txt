a blue light photoreceptor in plants phototropin mediates phototropism chloroplast relocation stomatal opening and leaf flattening responses . phototropin is divided into two functional moieties the n terminal photosensory and the c terminal signaling moieties . phototropin perceives light stimuli by the light oxygen or voltage domain in the n terminus the signal is then transduced intramolecularly to the c terminal kinase domain . two phototropins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which have overlapping and distinct functions exist in arabidopsis thaliana . _PROTEIN_ mediates responses with higher sensitivity than _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ mediates specific responses such as the chloroplast avoidance response and chloroplast dark positioning . to elucidate the molecular basis for the functional specificities of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we exchanged the n and c terminal moieties of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fused them to _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ them under the _PROTEIN_ promoter in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant background . with respect to phototropism and other responses the chimeric phototropin consisting of _PROTEIN_ n terminal and _PROTEIN_ c terminal moieties was almost as sensitive as _PROTEIN_ whereas the reverse combination functioned with lower sensitivity . hence the n terminal moiety _PROTEIN_ determined the sensitivity of the phototropins . unexpectedly both and mediated the chloroplast avoidance response which is specific to _PROTEIN_ . hence chloroplast avoidance activity appeared to be suppressed specifically in the combination of n and c terminal moieties of _PROTEIN_ . unlike the chloroplast avoidance response chloroplast dark positioning was observed for and but not for or suggesting that a specific structure in the n terminal moiety of _PROTEIN_ is required for this activity .
phototropin consists of two functional moieties the n terminal photosensory moiety and the c terminal kinase moiety . to investigate how each of these moieties contributes to the functional specificities of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ they were exchanged between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ in the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant background under the control of the authentic _PROTEIN_ promoter . full length _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ were _PROTEIN_ as controls . the resulting lines were designated as and . several independent lines that exhibited _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were selected for each construct and subjected to further analysis . we first observed the morphological phenotypes in those lines . the rosette leaves of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant curls downward . this phenotype was complemented in all the lines . in contrast to plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ derivatives under the control of the promoter the present lines grew normally without any growth defect such as reduction in the size of the rosette leaf or male sterility . the _PROTEIN_ levels of the introduced proteins were examined by immunoblotting of rosette leaves . first a line that _PROTEIN_ approximately endogenous levels of the introduced proteins was selected as a control line . the _PROTEIN_ levels in other lines were then examined with reference to . consequently and were selected as representative lines . a few additional lines were selected for each construct and used in some experiments for confirmation of the results . we then observed _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in those lines . as expected the intensity of _METHOD_ was comparable between those lines both in the mesophyll and epidermis . the _PROTEIN_ levels in dark grown seedlings were examined by immunoblotting . for an unknown reason the levels of in and were more than twice as high as the endogenous _PROTEIN_ level . similar over accumulation was observed in but not in or . in consistent with the immunoblotting result and exhibited higher _METHOD_ _METHOD_ than or in cotyledon mesophyll cells although the _METHOD_ in hypocotyl epidermis was comparable . hence the lower _PROTEIN_ were additionally chosen for phototropic experiments . we confirmed that the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was weaker in these lines . phototropins are autophosphorylated both in vitro and in vivo in a light dependent manner . the autophosphorylation is accompanied by a mobility shift that is observable by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . hence we examined the bl induced electrophoretic mobility shift in vivo . the mature plants were _PROTEIN_ to continuous red light for h and then treated with bl . the immunoblot analysis of the extracts indicated that all of the recombinant phototropins were autophosphorylated in response to bl . in addition the levels of the introduced proteins were not significantly changed by irradiation with bl at for h in rosette leaves although light dependent degradation of _PROTEIN_ has been reported in etiolated seedlings . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ localized in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ region . interestingly a fraction of is released into the cytoplasm in response to bl . more recently relocalization of into the cytoplasm was observed at higher resolution . in contrast to a fraction of is associated with the _LOCATION_ apparatus in a light dependent manner . using confocal microscopy we observed _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in cotyledon epidermal cells . as in the hypocotyl epidermis _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the cotyledon epidermis was comparable between the representative lines . in all the lines _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ region _PROTEIN_ of the light conditions . as with a punctate pattern appeared after irradiation with bl in . irradiation with bl from light emitting diodes _PROTEIN_ effectively induced the punctate staining as well . by contrast the punctate structure was observed in neither nor . instead cytoplasmic _METHOD_ was observed following the light treatment in these lines as previously reported for . hence the c terminal moiety was confirmed to be responsible for the distribution patterns specific to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the light . the appearance of punctate staining under a lower intensity of bl was also examined in and . under medium bl at the punctate staining of was detected within min of onset of bl exposure . by contrast punctate staining of remained undetectable even after min of exposure . hence responded to bl with a higher sensitivity than for the association with the punctate structures . as previously reported cytoplasmic _METHOD_ of was detected in the dark . interestingly similar _METHOD_ was observed in but not in . in guard cells _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ redundantly mediate bl induced stomatal opening with similar sensitivity . we examined whether the chimeric phototropins retain this activity . leaf strips were prepared from the rosette leaves and treated with or without high bl . consequently we confirmed that stomata opened in response to bl in all of the lines including wild type and . hence both and retain the ability to mediate stomatal opening . _PROTEIN_ mediates the phototropic response in the hypocotyl at a broad range of fluence rates whereas the response of _PROTEIN_ is elicited only by higher fluence rates . to determine which of the n and c terminal moieties is responsible for this difference in sensitivity we examined the responses mediated by chimeric phototropins . the hypocotyl curvature was measured after h exposure to various intensities of unilateral bl in two independent lines for each construct . in addition we analyzed one of each of the additional lines for and in which the introduced protein was underexpressed . all the lines except the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant efficiently responded to a higher intensity of bl . hence both and retained the basic ability to mediate the phototropic response . however the response to lower intensities of bl varied between the lines . the fluence response curves for and were almost identical to those for the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ mutant although the response was a little weaker in than in at . hence and were almost as sensitive as the endogenous _PROTEIN_ . by contrast the response mediated by the endogenous _PROTEIN_ or was much less sensitive . these lines failed to respond to bl at . it should be noted here that the c terminal moiety affected sensitivity to some extent . namely a small but significant difference was observed between the and lines . the latter showed stronger curvature than the former at . this could not be due to the difference in _PROTEIN_ levels because the level was higher in or than in as judged by immunoblot analysis . the chloroplast accumulation response is redundantly mediated by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . however the response mediated by _PROTEIN_ is more sensitive than that mediated by _PROTEIN_ . hence we examined the chloroplast accumulation response under different intensities of bl . as expected from the previous report a microbeam of low bl at led to accumulation of chloroplasts in the wild type but not in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the accumulation response was also observed in and lines whereas neither nor exhibited the response . hence high sensitivity in the accumulation response was conferred by the n terminal moiety as is the case with phototropism . we then examined whether chloroplasts accumulated at a medium intensity of bl to which both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are responsive . as expected all the lines except exhibited the response . in the line a medium intensity of bl elicited avoidance rather than the accumulation response . while both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mediate the accumulation response only _PROTEIN_ mediates the avoidance response to higher intensities of bl . to examine the avoidance response mesophyll cells were first irradiated with a bl beam at a medium intensity to accumulate chloroplasts and then the intensity was increased to to elicit the avoidance response . consequently the avoidance response was observed in the wild type the _PROTEIN_ mutant and . in the case of chloroplasts accumulated with the low bl treatment . the intensity was then increased to the medium level which elicited the avoidance response . hence mediated the avoidance response with a higher sensitivity . in summary all the derivatives except were capable of mediating the avoidance response . chloroplasts accumulate at the bottom of the cell in darkness . _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ is required for this specific positioning . therefore we examined this phenomenon in the present lines . as expected from the previous report this accumulation was observed in the wild type and lines but not in the line the _PROTEIN_ mutant or the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . interestingly dark positioning was restored in the line but not in the line . hence the n terminal moiety was responsible for chloroplast dark positioning . we then examined whether the n terminal fragment of _PROTEIN_ alone could position chloroplasts at the bottom of the cell in darkness . for this purpose we used a transgenic arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ the fragment fused to _METHOD_ under the control of promoter in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant background . observation revealed that the n terminal fragment of _PROTEIN_ could not position chloroplasts at the bottom of the cell even though the fragment was accumulated at a high level in this line . hence the c terminal moiety irrespective of its source was required for dark positioning . we further examined whether the c terminal fragment of _PROTEIN_ could induce dark positioning using the line in which the fragment was _PROTEIN_ under the control of promoter . however chloroplasts were not positioned at the bottom of the cell .
the wild type and phototropin mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were used . plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and the n and c terminal fragment of _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ under the control of the promoter in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant background have been described elsewhere . seeds were planted on agar plates containing murashige and skoog _METHOD_ medium with w/v sucrose

its end was fused to the _METHOD_ gene with a bamhi tail at its end to produce . the promoter in the binary vector was replaced with a genomic fragment corresponding to the _PROTEIN_ authentic promoter _PROTEIN_ . the fragment was then inserted into _PROTEIN_ . which contains the fusion gene between _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was previously described . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion fragment was engineered by a combination of pcr reactions as described here . the and fragments with additional small overlapping sequences were amplified by pcr . these overlapping fragments served as templates to produce the _PROTEIN_ fragment by the polymerase reaction . the resulting fusion fragment was then amplified in a second pcr reaction . in the actual experiments the latter two steps were carried out consecutively in the same tube . the fragment in which the and were fused and the fragment in which and were fused were prepared in similar ways . the sequences of the primers are listed below . for aaagaattcatggaaccaacagaaaaacc _PROTEIN_ aaaggatccaaaaacatttgtttgcagatc _PROTEIN_ aaaggatccatggtgagcaagggcgaggagctg _METHOD_
