appropriate methylation of genomes is essential for gene regulation . here we describe the six member orthrus gene family of arabidopsis thaliana that plays a role in dna methylation in vivo . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are predicted to encode proteins that contain one plant homeodomain two really interesting new gene _PROTEIN_ domains and one set _PROTEIN_ associated _PROTEIN_ domain whereas _PROTEIN_ encodes a protein with only one _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ domain . cdnas for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were isolated and when _PROTEIN_ as glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins were capable of promoting ubiquitylation in vitro with the _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ promotes ubiquitylation when paired with additional _PROTEIN_ family members . _PROTEIN_ proteins with substitutions in metal ligand binding residues in each _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domain individually and _PROTEIN_ truncation derivatives lacking one or both _PROTEIN_ domains were tested for their ability to catalyze ubiquitylation in vitro . in these assays either _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domain is capable of promoting ubiquitylation . the phd alone is not active as an ligase nor is it required for ligase activity . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ are _LOCATION_ localized in transgenic arabidopsis plants . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis leads to an altered flowering time . inspection of dna methylation at _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ repeats revealed hypomethylation when orth proteins were overexpressed . once initiated a _PROTEIN_ flowering phenotype persisted in the absence of the orth transgene consistent with epigenetic effects at _PROTEIN_ . we conclude that orth proteins are ligases mediating dna methylation status in vivo .
inspection of the arabidopsis predicted proteome for multiple _PROTEIN_ domain containing proteins identified five members of the orthrus/vim family and a related protein orth _PROTEIN_ . orth proteins contain an n terminal phd and two _PROTEIN_ domains flanking an _PROTEIN_ domain . _PROTEIN_ is missing the n terminal phd and c terminal _PROTEIN_ domain but contains the _PROTEIN_ and n terminal _PROTEIN_ domains . proteins with both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ domains are referred to here as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ proteins . mammalian _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ proteins have an altered domain organization compared with plant orth proteins with an n terminal ubiquitin like domain and an _PROTEIN_ domain that is flanked n terminally by a phd and c terminally by a _PROTEIN_ domain . additional arabidopsis proteins contain an _PROTEIN_ domain without a phd or _PROTEIN_ domain . these include ones with a _PROTEIN_ domain _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as well as those without any other described protein protein interaction domain _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ domains of all arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ family members were compared with selected _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ proteins from other species and with the other arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ only proteins . phylogenetic analysis using the entire protein results in the same conclusions . within the atorth family _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ form a clade . _PROTEIN_ has similarity to _PROTEIN_ and amino acid identity to _PROTEIN_ across the entire protein and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have overall amino acid and nucleotide identity . in contrast _PROTEIN_ is and identical to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have amino acid identity . interestingly _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are separated by only one predicted pseudogene and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are similarly separated one predicted open reading frame apart suggesting that duplication events gave rise to the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pairs . comparisons of the _PROTEIN_ domains reveal that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ proteins of arabidopsis have greater similarity to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ proteins from _PROTEIN_ than they do to arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ proteins . this implies that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ proteins were present in the common ancestor of plants and animals . in contrast the plant specific arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ proteins are present in a clade with the _PROTEIN_ only proteins suggesting that they are more closely related to each other than to the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ proteins . to determine which genes are _PROTEIN_ effort was expended to isolated cdnas for all six members . cdnas were isolated for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ using rt pcr . attempts to isolate cdnas for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ failed using tair annotations for their predicted open reading frames . thus the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is uncertain . the nucleotide identity between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ coding regions makes _PROTEIN_ sequence tag /cdna gene assignments _PROTEIN_ . two _PROTEIN_ ests/cdnas are listed on tair but their sequences are identical to both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and the clones are not available for further sequencing so their assignment to a single locus can not be made . the cdna sequences that are ascribed to _PROTEIN_ have few _PROTEIN_ specific nucleotides indicating that these are annotated correctly and that there is no _PROTEIN_ cdna in that set . only a single est is listed for _PROTEIN_ and this assignment appears to be correct . thus there is no evidence for _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and there is scant evidence for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . these data suggest that only a subset of orths significantly contribute to orth activity in vivo . the _PROTEIN_ domain is associated with the ability to function in ubiquitin transfer although not all _PROTEIN_ proteins demonstrate in vitro ligase activity . the murine _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domain containing protein is active in in vitro ubiquitylation assays with the . to determine if orth proteins function as ligases full length _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and orl proteins were _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli as glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ fusions purified on glutathione beads and tested for the ability to promote ubiquitylation in vitro as previously described . all three orth proteins were active with the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and as expected omission of or orth protein eliminates the attachment of ubiquitin to higher molecular weight proteins . similarly _PROTEIN_ which lacks the c terminal _PROTEIN_ and n terminal phd was also active . we asked whether orth proteins require a specific or for activity . _PROTEIN_ is a member of the _PROTEIN_ family of arabidopsis . _PROTEIN_ was tested with additional of the _PROTEIN_ family _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as well as with members of three other subgroups _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ shows robust activity with _PROTEIN_ family members _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ also shows activity albeit diminished with other more divergent _PROTEIN_ family members _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was not active with the other tested _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . thus recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is most active in vitro with from the _PROTEIN_ subfamily . to determine the domain associated with the ligase activity of _PROTEIN_ codons for conserved metal ligand residues in the phd and each _PROTEIN_ domain were individually targeted for mutagenesis . these residues have been shown for many _PROTEIN_ proteins to be essential for ligase activity . codons for the phd metal ligand binding positions for the n terminal _PROTEIN_ metal ligand binding positions or for the c terminal _PROTEIN_ metal ligand binding positions and were mutagenized to encode alanine creating proteins called mpd for mutant phd mnr for mutant n terminal _PROTEIN_ and mcr for mutant c terminal _PROTEIN_ . when these _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins were tested for ubiquitylation activity with _PROTEIN_ all three retained robust activity in end point assays . time course experiments to detect differences in ubiquitylation rates showed that activity of each mutant protein was largely unaffected relative to wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ indicating that alteration of one _PROTEIN_ domain or the phd does not dramatically interfere with the in vitro ubiquitylation activity of _PROTEIN_ . to further characterize the _PROTEIN_ domain responsible for ligase activity of _PROTEIN_ the open reading frame was truncated to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ proteins lacking one or more domains lacking either the c terminal _PROTEIN_ only the c terminal _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ domains or the phd and n terminal _PROTEIN_ domains _PROTEIN_ . these truncations were assayed with _PROTEIN_ in in vitro ubiquitylation assays and were compared with the activity of the full length protein . all truncated proteins exhibited ligase activity with _PROTEIN_ demonstrating that either _PROTEIN_ domain can provide ligase activity in vitro . the autoubiquitylation of these proteins can be seen in the anti _PROTEIN_ blots visualized as slowed migration in the complete reactions only resulting from covalent addition of ubiquitin to the _PROTEIN_ orth fusion protein . the contribution of the phd to ubiquitylation activity was additionally tested by comparing the reactions of a truncated _PROTEIN_ protein with only the phd to that of the identical protein except with substitutions in four of the eight metal ligand binding residues in the phd . in these reactions there were faint higher molecular weight anti ubiquitin immunoreactive bands but the profile was identical between reactions with or without the orth phd and reactions containing either orth phd or orth mphd . there does not appear to be any ubiquitylation activity associated with the closely related phd at least in these in vitro assays . to determine the intracellular localization of orth proteins constructs for _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in fusion with _METHOD_ were made and stably transformed into arabidopsis . _METHOD_ was visualized by _METHOD_ microscopy and compared with diamidino phenylindole _LOCATION_ staining . both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ co localized with dapi staining _LOCATION_ . thus _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are located primarily in _LOCATION_ . while producing plants for intracellular localization studies we observed that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants exhibited delayed flowering whereas _METHOD_ orl plants did not . similarly citation recently reported that _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of a constitutive promoter leads to a mild to moderate _PROTEIN_ flowering phenotype whereas _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ does not . to further explore the molecular basis of this effect multiple plants were analyzed for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is a homeodomain transcription _PROTEIN_ completely silenced by dna methylation in all cells of wild type plants except in the developing endosperm . hypomethylation of the _PROTEIN_ promoter leads to ectopic _PROTEIN_ causing a _PROTEIN_ flowering phenotype . using rna extracted from leaf tissue no _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is observed in wild type plants whereas varying levels of _PROTEIN_ are seen in almost all independent transformed with either _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ by real time pcr of cdna relative to actin . further analysis by southern blotting confirmed hypomethylation at the _PROTEIN_ promoter . increased digestion of genomic dna by the methylation sensitive enzyme cfoi was present in all _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines compared with the negative control untransformed col ecotype . a correlation is observed between _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels and _PROTEIN_ methylation levels throughout the independent for both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . higher _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is generally coincident with _PROTEIN_ methylation _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and lower _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is coincident with a more wild type level of methylation _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . noticeable _PROTEIN_ flowering phenotypes are only observed in lines with the highest _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . to test if the _PROTEIN_ flowering phenotype was the function of a dominant negative form of orth protein caused by the _METHOD_ tag an _PROTEIN_ construct for untagged _PROTEIN_ was also introduced into col under the control of the promoter . flowering time _PROTEIN_ as the leaves present prior to transition to flowering was measured in segregating seedlings derived from independent and five of the lines had an average leaf number higher than wild type . this _PROTEIN_ flowering phenotype was also associated with _PROTEIN_ methylation at the _PROTEIN_ locus . therefore plants overexpressing either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ exhibit a _PROTEIN_ flowering phenotype that is likely to be caused by the ectopic _PROTEIN_ of a hypomethylated _PROTEIN_ locus . loss of _PROTEIN_ leads to _PROTEIN_ methylation at the heterochromatic _PROTEIN_ repeats . to test if overexpression of orth family members affects methylation at the _PROTEIN_ repeats in addition to the _PROTEIN_ locus _PROTEIN_ southern blots were performed on similarly digested genomic dna from wild type columbia and transgenic lines . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ dna methylation was observed in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and untagged _PROTEIN_ lines . finally to test if _PROTEIN_ hypomethylation was stable in subsequent generations plants from two _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ lines were planted . the flowering time was measured and plants were genotyped for the presence of the orth transgene . as expected the average flowering time of all lines was delayed relative to wild type columbia plants . in addition the presence or absence of the _METHOD_ orth _PROTEIN_ transgene did not affect the flowering time . this shows that orth overexpression in the generation leads to a stable and heritable _PROTEIN_ flowering phenotype .
the _PROTEIN_ domain of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ was used in blast searches against the complete non redundant arabidopsis genome . blast searches identified five proteins each with two _PROTEIN_ domains a phd and an _PROTEIN_ domain as well as one protein with only a single _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ domain . the smart database was used to analyze retrieved sequences followed by manual inspection to confirm the presence of the complete phd/ring/sra domains . the clustalx program was used to generate an alignment of the orth protein sequence . the alignment was generated using a _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ with gap opening and gap extension penalty parameters of and respectively in pairwise alignment and and respectively in the multiple alignments . the macclade sequence editor was used to manually edit the alignment . the phylogenetic trees were created by _PROTEIN_ using the neighbor joining method with bootstrap replicates . arabidopsis orth cdnas were cloned by reverse transcription reactions followed by pcr to amplify the predicted open reading frame and recombined into gateway pdonr vector . rna was isolated from either day old arabidopsis thaliana ecotype col seedlings or floral tissue from to week old plants using qiagen rneasy plant rna extraction kit following manufacturer s instructions . the dna sequence was identical to the predicted orf . orths were _PROTEIN_ in bacteria as _PROTEIN_ fusions from based plasmids . quik change site directed mutagenesis was used to make a series of point mutations in _PROTEIN_ domain metal ligand codons . truncations were made with gene specific primers with in frame stop codons using cdna clones as templates and the sequences were verified . the positions of truncations _PROTEIN_ are as follows phd only nt phd and n terminal _PROTEIN_ nt no c terminal _PROTEIN_ nt . the protein with the _PROTEIN_ and c terminal _PROTEIN_ domains contains nucleotides from to stop . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ coding regions were recombined into the binary transformation vector for localization studies . overexpression of tagless _PROTEIN_ was achieved by recombination into pyl tap c t but with a stop codon present . _PROTEIN_ orth fusions were _PROTEIN_ in e. coli strain ai or plyss . transformed cells were grown at for h or to an of before induction with arabinose or mm isopropyl d thiogalactopyranoside respectively for h at . cells were harvested by centrifugation and were then lysed in a buffer containing mm tris hcl ph mm nacl triton x . for purification glutathione agarose was added to cleared lysates and incubated for h at . beads were then washed four times with wash buffer containing mm tris hcl ph mm nacl triton x . _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins were eluted with elution buffer containing mm tris hcl ph mm glutathione and triton x . glycerol was added to the eluted protein to a final concentration of . proteins were stored at until needed . ubiquitylation reactions containing mm tris hcl ph mm mm mm _PROTEIN_ mm dithiothreitol mm phosphocreatine unit creatine kinase ng yeast ng of recombinant arabidopsis ng of _PROTEIN_ orth and ubiquitin were incubated at for h. for histone ubiquitylation assays of crude bovine nucleosomes were added to the ubiquitylation reaction . reactions were stopped by adding of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ sample buffer _PROTEIN_ and were then analyzed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ followed by western blotting using ubiquitin and/or _PROTEIN_ antibodies as described previously . all transgenes were _PROTEIN_ in ecotype arabidopsis ecotype columbia . seed was surface sterilized with bleach and triton x and were grown on gm containing agar with _METHOD_ salts under continuous light . seedling roots were examined for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ using a nikon optiphot _METHOD_ microscope with a nikon super high pressure mercury lamp power supply model hb . images were captured by a qimaging retiga camera and _PROTEIN_ software . six _METHOD_ of rna extracted from adult leaf tissue was converted to cdna . _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were analyzed by semiquantitative real time pcr using primers and and internal primer _PROTEIN_ . actin was used to standardize cdna levels and was quantified with primers and and visualized with brillant sybr green qpcr master mix . dna was extracted from leaves or flowers of recently bolted plants using a slightly modified cetyl trimethylammonium bromide /sarkosyl method . for _PROTEIN_ southern blots of dna was digested with hpaii overnight and run for h on a agarose gel and was then transferred to _LOCATION_ . the _LOCATION_ was incubated overnight with radiolabeled probe for _PROTEIN_ bp repeats . after washing the _LOCATION_ was exposed to film for h. _PROTEIN_ southern blots were performed as previously described .
