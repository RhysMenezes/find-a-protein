the actin _LOCATION_ of higher plants plays an essential role in plant morphogenesis and in _PROTEIN_ various cellular activities . in this study we established a tobacco by cell line stably transformed with a _METHOD_ fimbrin actin binding domain construct that allows visualization of actin microfilaments in living cells . using this cell line designated by we performed time sequential observations of mf dynamics during cell cycle progression . detailed analyses revealed the appearance of a broad mf band in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ phase that separated to form a structure corresponding to the so called actin depleted zone in mitosis . in by the mf structure at the cell cortex in mitosis appeared to form two bands rather than the adz . measurements of _METHOD_ intensities of the cell cortex indicated an mf distribution that resembled two peaks and we therefore named the structure mf twin peaks _PROTEIN_ . the cell plate formed exactly within the valley between the _PROTEIN_ at cytokinesis and this cell plate guidance was distorted by disruption of the _PROTEIN_ by an inhibitor of actin polymerization . these results suggest that the _PROTEIN_ originates from the broad mf band in the _PROTEIN_ phase and functions as a marker of cytokinesis .
the second actin binding domain of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ protein was fused to the c terminus of _METHOD_ and stably _PROTEIN_ in tobacco by cells to generate the by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ cell line . confocal observations revealed _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of filamentous structures near the cell cortex and along the cytoplasmic strands at the mid plane . such filamentous structures were also observed in another cell line of by transformed with the same construct . these cortical filamentous structures closely resembled those observed in cells following particle bombardment with the mouse talin f actin binding domain _METHOD_ although the mf structures in the cytoplasmic strands could not be clearly observed in the _METHOD_ mtn bombarded cells . arabidopsis cell cultures stably _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fimbrin also revealed similar filamentous structures near the cell cortex and in the cytoplasm . to ensure the _METHOD_ labelled _METHOD_ structures of the by cells did represent mfs rhodamine phalloidin staining was performed after gentle permeabilization of the cells with glycerol . the structures labelled by _METHOD_ and rhodamine _METHOD_ almost overlapped at both the cell cortex and the cell mid plane . in addition the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ disappeared following treatment with cytochalasin d an inhibitor of actin polymerization . these observations clearly indicate that the _METHOD_ fimbrin fusion protein labelled mfs in the tobacco by cells . as the mf structures were shown to be dynamically changing during cell cycle progression in fixed cells we first monitored the changes in mf structures in living by cells . at the _PROTEIN_ phase transverse and meshwork like mfs were observed at the cell cortex as also found in rhodamin phalloidin stained by cells after fixation . at the mid plane the mfs extended through the cytoplasm from the cell _LOCATION_ to the cell periphery . notably mfs were localized at the periphery of the cytoplasmic strands rather than in their middle . a d image constructed by volume rendering showed a basket like mf structure within a whole cell . at s phase when the cell _LOCATION_ moved from the cell periphery to the centre the mfs extended radially from the _LOCATION_ surface to the cell periphery . in the _PROTEIN_ phase the cortical mfs became predominantly transverse oriented and concentrated at the cell centre so as to form a band like structure . at the mid plane there was an increase in the amount of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ surrounding the cell _LOCATION_ and at the mid region of the cell cortex . in contrast the _METHOD_ along the cytoplasmic strands and at the cortex of both cell ends was weak and the filaments appeared to be finer than those in the _PROTEIN_ and s phases . subsequent observation of mf structures during mitosis revealed that the cortical mfs that were transversely oriented at the _PROTEIN_ phase formed meshwork structures at metaphase . these meshwork structures were probably localized on both the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . at the centre of the cell a zone with a weak mf network but still with some mfs localized could be distinguished . this structure closely resembled the adz although in the by cells there appeared to be two mf bands rather than the adz . at the mid plane the mfs stretched throughout the cytoplasm as in the _PROTEIN_ through _PROTEIN_ phases but the filaments were now very fine . only a dim _METHOD_ was observed in the mitotic apparatus . in _PROTEIN_ anaphase two populations of longitudinal mfs appeared temporally between the two sets of chromosomes as reported in rhodamine phalloidin injected tradescantia cells . in telophase the mfs co localized with the mt phragmoplast and according to phragmoplast development moved to the cell periphery . the above mentioned mf dynamics could be observed in a single living cell by time sequential observations from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ through mitosis to cytokinesis . in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ phase the cortical mf band could be recognized at the centre of the cell . as the cell cycle progressed a zone with weak mfs appeared at the centre of the cortical mf band then two mf bands became evident at mitosis . after cytokinesis the cell plate seemed to form at the site of the weak mfs in mitosis . as the above time sequential observations at the mid plane by confocal laser scanning microscopy _PROTEIN_ suggested a separation of the cortical mf band from the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ phase to mitosis we attempted to observe the dynamics of the cortical mf structures in more detail . the mf band was observed in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ phase when a phragmosome structure could be clearly distinguished by a differential interference contrast image obtained from light microscopy . as the cell cycle progressed to mitosis the mf band began to separate at the cell cortex and a zone with a weak cortical mf network appeared at the centre of the mf band . measurements of _METHOD_ intensity at the cell cortex by _METHOD_ microscopy showed the highest intensity at the centre of the cell in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ phase . with cell cycle progression the _METHOD_ intensity at the cell centre _PROTEIN_ and resulted in the appearance of two peaks together with an increase in the distance between the mf band . in accordance with the reduced _METHOD_ intensity at the cell centre the phragmosome structure became obscure . based on the distribution of _METHOD_ intensities of the cortical mf structures in mitosis we named the structure composed of the two mf bands as the mf twin peaks _PROTEIN_ . this _PROTEIN_ structure was confirmed in another cell line of by and in by cells incubated with rhodamine phalloidin after permeabilization . a time sequential observation at the cell surface also revealed the separation of the mf band . in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ phase mfs that were transversely oriented started to develop a meshwork structure and subsequently formed two mf bands with a weak mf network zone in mitosis . continuation of the time sequential observations to the _PROTEIN_ phase demonstrated that the cell plate was formed min from the _PROTEIN_ phase . the cell plate appeared to develop at the position previously occupied by the zone with a weak mf network in metaphase . measurement of the distances between the two peaks of the _PROTEIN_ at mitosis and also of that between one peak and the cell plate indicated that the latter was almost half the distance of the former and suggested that the cell plate was formed in the valley of the _PROTEIN_ . to investigate the functional relevance of the _PROTEIN_ to the cell plate guidance we examined an effect of cytochalasin d an inhibitor of actin polymerization . when we applied cd h after aphidicolin removal the mf structures disappeared in h . although cell cycle progression was not affected by the cd treatment abnormal cell plates were observed h after aphidicolin removal by aniline blue staining . in the non treated control cells the cell plates were smooth and sharp while in the cd treated cells some were not vertical to the cell cortex and some were broad and twisted . removal of the cd at h restored the mf structures but the cell plate was still twisted . these distorted cell plates were observed for approximately of the cells treated with cd from to h in which the cells with _PROTEIN_ were mostly observed . in contrast in cells treated with cd from to h in which phragmoplasts were mostly observed the percentage of distorted cell plates _PROTEIN_ significantly .
tobacco by suspensions were diluted fold with a modified linsmaier and skoog medium supplemented with d at weekly intervals as described by citation . the cell suspensions were agitated on a rotary shaker at rpm at in the dark . cell synchronization was performed as described by citation . in brief ml day old cells were transferred to ml fresh medium and cultured for h with mg aphidicolin . the cells were washed with vol fresh medium and then resuspended in the same medium . after aphidicolin release cell cycle progression was monitored by counting the percentage of cells in mitosis which was determined with a _METHOD_ microscope after staining the _LOCATION_ with diamidino phenylindole . the region encoding the second actin binding domain of _PROTEIN_ was pcr amplified from an arabidopsis thaliana cdna library . the amplified fragment replaced the mtn of the camv _METHOD_ mtn vector kindly provided by dr t. kagawa of tsukuba university resulting in an in frame fusion of n terminus _METHOD_ and c terminus fimbrin . the _METHOD_ mtn vector was modified from the _METHOD_ vector obtained from dr y. niwa of shizuoka prefecture university so as to contain gly ala repeats between _METHOD_ and the mtn . the resulting _METHOD_ fimbrin region was then subcloned into the binary vector for transformation . the _METHOD_ fimbrin construct was transformed into agrobacterium tumefaciens strain . a ml aliquot of day old by cells was incubated with overnight culture of the transformed a. tumefaciens as described by citation . after days incubation at cells were washed four times in ml lsd medium then plated onto solid lsd medium containing mg _PROTEIN_ and mg hygromycin . calluses which appeared after days were transferred onto new plates and cultured independently until they reached approximately cm in diameter when they were transferred to ml liquid lsd medium and agitated on a rotary shaker at rpm at in the dark . after month a cell line suitable for observing mfs was selected by examination of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ by _METHOD_ microscopy and the cell line obtained was designated by . transformation of cell suspensions of arabidopsis col was performed essentially as described by citation with the same _METHOD_ fimbrin construct . a cell suspension of day old by cells was filtrated onto filter paper and the cells bombarded with gold particles coated with the appropriate vector constructs using a particle delivery system _PROTEIN_ according to the manufacturer 's recommendations . filtrated by cells were placed at a distance of cm under the stopping screen and bombarded in a vacuum of inches hg at a helium pressure of psi . following bombardment cells were diluted in lsd medium and kept in the dark at for h before observation . for simultaneous observations of rhodamine phalloidin and _METHOD_ fimbrin the by cells were suspended in a solution containing mm _PROTEIN_ mm mm egta glycerol mm mannitol and rhodamine phalloidin and incubated for min at room temperature . for time sequential observations synchronized by cells were transferred into mm diameter petri dishes with mm diameter coverslip windows at the bottom . the dishes were placed onto the inverted platform of a _METHOD_ microscope equipped with a confocal laser scanning head and control _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or a cooled ccd camera head system . three dimensional images were reconstructed from the continuous optical sections within a step size using metamorph software _PROTEIN_ . the images were processed digitally using photoshop software . on request all novel materials described in this publication will be made available in a timely manner for non commercial research purposes .
