pollen tubes must navigate through different female tissues to deliver sperm to the embryo sac for fertilization . protein disulfide isomerases play important roles in the maturation of secreted or _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins . here we show that certain t dna insertions in arabidopsis thaliana a protein disulfide isomerase have reduced seed set due to delays in embryo sac maturation . reciprocal crosses indicate that these mutations acted sporophytically and aniline blue staining and scanning electron microscopy showed that funicular and micropylar pollen tube guidance were disrupted . a yellow _METHOD_ protein fusion was _PROTEIN_ localized in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and was _PROTEIN_ in all tissues examined . in ovules _PROTEIN_ in integument tissues was much higher in the micropylar region in _PROTEIN_ developmental stages but there was no _PROTEIN_ in embryo sacs . we show that reduced seed set occurred when another copy of full length or when enzymatically active truncated versions were _PROTEIN_ but not when an enzymatically inactive version was _PROTEIN_ indicating that these t dna insertion lines are gain of function mutants . our results suggest that these truncated versions of function in sporophytic tissues to affect ovule structure and impede embryo sac development thereby disrupting pollen tube guidance .
an _LOCATION_ pdi was shown to be important for gamete fusion in mammals . analyses of est databases obtained from egg sperm and embryo sac est libraries in maize indicated that several pdi like genes were represented in these libraries . to determine if arabidopsis homologs of these maize pdil proteins played any role in plant reproduction we analyzed several arabidopsis t dna insertion mutants . there were no reproductive phenotypes for the or insertion lines . however plants with certain insertions in showed smaller siliques and reduced seed set in both heterozygous and homozygous plants indicating the dominant effect of these insertions . vegetative growth was normal except for the shorter stature . we obtained eight t dna insertion mutants in . for all of these we could identify homozygous lines but only _PROTEIN_ and showed reduced seed set . to understand why this might be we performed detailed _PROTEIN_ and phenotypic analyses on these mutants . as shown in figures and the t dna insertion lines and located in the promoter region had no or only a minor effect on gene _PROTEIN_ . by contrast in and inserted in the first or introns respectively _PROTEIN_ levels were significantly reduced . for three other insertion lines _PROTEIN_ we could only detect truncated transcripts . although line was predicted to be inserted in the intron according to the arabidopsis information resource our thermal asymmetric interlaced pcr and sequencing analyses indicated that there was another insertion in the intron with an opposite orientation . there was also a bp deletion between these two insertions . the _PROTEIN_ appears to be a null since no transcript was detected with any of the primer pairs tested . both heterozygous and homozygous plants of line and line had reduced seed set somewhat more so in the homozygotes . as shown in figure the _PROTEIN_ level of both these insertion lines was lower than in the wild type suggesting that the phenotype was due to the truncated protein rather than to overexpression . the siliques of these two lines were also significantly smaller than those of the wild type . surprisingly the null mutant line as well as line which has truncated transcripts showed normal seed set . these results suggested that the truncated products of line and line had dominant effects but that they were not completely penetrant as some seed was set . we also crossed line with insertion lines in and . however neither double mutant showed fertilization related phenotypes which might reflect the highly redundant functions of the pdi like genes in arabidopsis genome . since these two insertion lines showed seed set phenotypes and both sides of the t dna insertion in line were recovered we chose line for further analyses . to determine what caused the reduced seed set phenotype we checked pollen tube growth in pistils of the line homozygous mutant . approximately of the ovules in the homozygote attracted pollen tubes to the micropyle but did not although many pollen tubes were seen growing on the placenta and funicular tissue . the pollen tubes appeared to have lost their way after they grew out of the transmitting tract . the undeveloped ovules either received no pollen tubes or had pollen tubes randomly growing onto the ovule surface and on the funiculus . these observations indicated that funicular and microplylar guidance to undeveloped ovules was disrupted in this line . to further confirm the observed pollen tube guidance defects we used scanning electron microscopy . many ovules had no pollen tubes in the vicinity or pollen tubes wound around the surface of undeveloped ovules indicating funicular and micropylar defects in pollen tube guidance . to determine if the reduced seed set was caused by defects of gametophyte origin we performed reciprocal crosses with wild type plants using plants that were heterozygous for the t dna insertion . the kanamycin resistance marker was silenced in line so we used pcr to determine the genotype of the progeny . despite the reduced seed set the transmission of the t dna insertion was normal through both parents suggesting that the reduced seed set phenotype was caused by sporophytic effects . although we had not noticed any abnormalities in ovule structure we decided to check ovule and embryo sac development in both heterozygous and homozygous plants . in heterozygous plants ovule development was normal but ovules of line homozygotes often showed a protruding embryo sac phenotype presumably caused by shorter integuments . furthermore although many line embryo sacs were normal others were delayed at varying stages of maturation _LOCATION_ in both heterozygous and homozygous plants . embryo sacs of line homozygotes showed similar phenotypes and thus are not shown . segregation analysis of the line insertion mutant we also performed reciprocal crosses between the homozygous mutants and wild type plants . when the mutants were used as female the number of undeveloped ovules was similar to those in a self cross . similar results were obtained when heterozygous plants were used for the crosses suggesting that the reduced seed set phenotype was of maternal sporophytic origin but affected female gametophyte development . seed set analyses following reciprocal and self crosses to test the prediction that the reduced seed set phenotypes were caused by the _PROTEIN_ of truncated transcripts we transformed wild type plants with constructs in which the gene products would correspond to those in the line or line insertion lines named and respectively . figure shows the constructs used for this purpose as well as three other constructs used in subsequent experiments . for each construct we used the endogenous promoter and inserted either green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ or yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ between the signal peptide and the coding sequence . the resulting transgenic plants were selected by _PROTEIN_ and resistant plants were transferred to soil . siliques were dissected to analyze the seed set . for each truncation construct some plants had reduced seed set . to confirm _PROTEIN_ of the transgene real time quantitative pcr experiments were used to compare plants showing the phenotype with those that did not . for each construct plants showing the phenotype also had higher levels of the truncated transcripts . the endogenous _PROTEIN_ level was only slightly altered in the truncation and truncation transformants whether or not the plant showed the reduced seed set phenotype . these results indicate that the phenotypes were caused by the transgene rather than by a cosuppression effect . characterization of the transgenic plants we also checked the pollen tube growth in siliques of the transgenic plants and found that undeveloped ovules failed to attract pollen tubes . in these transgenic lines and similar to the insertion lines we found normal embryo sacs and arrested embryo sacs . most of the arrested embryo sacs arrested early _LOCATION_ . the phenotypes were stronger than in lines and and correlated with the reduced seed set . has two typical active thioredoxin domains usually named a and but it lacks the inactive thioredoxin domains b and as well as the acidic c domain and the _LOCATION_ retention signal kdel . because it has a d domain at its c terminus belongs to the pdi d family . there is also a predicted signal peptide at the n terminus . the protein structure of is shown in figure . to determine the _PROTEIN_ pattern of we performed rt pcr analysis using cdna samples extracted from different arabidopsis organs . was _PROTEIN_ in all the tissues examined with a lower _PROTEIN_ level in pollen relative to other tissues . to determine _PROTEIN_ at the protein level we used a _METHOD_ fusion construct _METHOD_ . at least ovules from six independent transgenic plants were checked and all showed similar _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ patterns . as shown in figures to sp _METHOD_ was highly _PROTEIN_ in vegetative and reproductive _METHOD_ in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ roots and in flowers . although the rt pcr results showed lower _PROTEIN_ in pollen the _METHOD_ fusion protein was easily detected in pollen tubes germinated in vitro . to obtain detailed _PROTEIN_ information for flowers where pollen tube guidance takes place we checked the _METHOD_ fusion pattern in ovules of different developmental stages . in early stage flowers the funiculus curves backward and the inner and outer integuments do not cover the nucellus . the _METHOD_ signal was observed in both inner and outer integuments and also in nucellar cells . in _PROTEIN_ stage and in stage flowers _METHOD_ was also _PROTEIN_ in the integument cells but was not observed in the embryo sac . _PROTEIN_ in the mature ovule was striking with enhanced _METHOD_ in the micropylar region as shown in figures and . after fertilization _METHOD_ was observed in the seed integuments but not in the embryo . to determine the subcellular localization of we used two strategies . first we checked localization in plants _PROTEIN_ sp _METHOD_ . in root hair cells _METHOD_ was observed around the _LOCATION_ and in some organelles consistent with _LOCATION_ localization . the _METHOD_ signal was also localized in the _LOCATION_ in leaf and hypocotyl cells . second we made a construct with a red _METHOD_ protein fused to the c terminus of driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . this construct was cobombarded into onion epidermal cells with a _METHOD_ kdel construct to mark the _LOCATION_ . as shown in figures to colocalized with the _LOCATION_ marker . a construct that lacked the d domain was also _LOCATION_ localized . to determine whether is a functional enzyme we performed a yeast complementation experiment . the _PROTEIN_ gene of yeast encodes an _LOCATION_ resident protein that is structurally related to pdi and essential for growth . the complementation experiments were performed in cells carrying a deletion of the _PROTEIN_ gene which can be rescued by the pwbk pdi centromeric plasmid . this centromeric vector carries a gene which allows positive selection for growth in the absence of uracil and negative selection in the presence of fluoroorotic acid . as shown in figure the construct complemented the yeast mutant and allowed growth on ypg plates in the absence of pwbk pdi . furthermore constructs in which mutations in either of the two thioredoxin active sites were introduced only inefficiently complemented the yeast mutant . the inactive mutant which has both active sites mutated was unable to complement under these conditions . none of the colonies picked from the foa plate grew on plates lacking uracil demonstrating that growth on ypg plates was not due to the presence of the centromeric plasmid pwbk pdi . we therefore conclude that has pdi activity . plants that were heterozygous or homozygous for the t dna insertions and transformants carrying truncated constructs all showed reduced seed set suggesting that the truncated protein in these lines had a dominant effect . to determine whether a dominant negative or a gain of function mutation could explain the phenotype we analyzed the isomerase activity of the truncated proteins . as shown in figure constructs in which the d domain was truncated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or in which only the first thioredoxin domain was present _PROTEIN_ both complemented the yeast pdi mutation . these results strongly support the gain of function explanation . if the truncated protein of caused a gain of function effect overexpression of might have the same effect . to test this possibility we transformed wild type plants with the cdna driven by its endogenous promoter and separately with a construct in which both active sites were mutated also driven by its endogenous promoter . of the plants transformed with the wild type version of the cdna six showed reduced seed set while all transformants with the mutated version showed normal seed set . we also observed some developmentally delayed embryo sacs in the transgenic plants with the wild type version supporting the idea that it was the action of in the sporophyte that affected embryo sac development . _PROTEIN_ of the transgene was tested by real time quantitative pcr . as shown in figure transformants with different _PROTEIN_ levels were obtained for both constructs but all _PROTEIN_ to levels higher than those found in wild type plants . these results support the idea that the t dna insertion lines and are dominant gain of function mutants .
