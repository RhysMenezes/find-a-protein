cell surface proteins play critical roles in the perception of environmental stimuli at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and ensuing signal transduction . intracellular localization of such proteins must be strictly regulated which requires elaborate integration of exocytic and endocytic trafficking pathways . subcellular localization of arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a receptor that recognizes bacterial flagellin also depends on _LOCATION_ trafficking . however our understanding about the _METHOD_ involved is still limited . in this study we visualized ligand induced endocytosis of _PROTEIN_ using green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in nicotiana benthamiana . upon treatment with the peptide internalized _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ from the pm was transported to a compartment with properties intermediate between the trans _LOCATION_ network and the multivesicular endosome . this compartment gradually discarded the tgn characteristics as it continued along the trafficking pathway . we further found that _PROTEIN_ endocytosis involves distinct _PROTEIN_ subgroups at different steps . moreover we demonstrated that transport of de novo synthesized _PROTEIN_ to the pm also involves a distinct _PROTEIN_ subgroup . our results demonstrate the complex regulatory system for properly localizing _PROTEIN_ and functional differentiation in _PROTEIN_ members in endo and exocytosis .
in this study we used the transient _PROTEIN_ system in n. benthamiana leaf epidermal cells by infiltration of agrobacterium tumefaciens which has been successfully used to observe intracellular trafficking of _METHOD_ protein tagged proteins and simultaneous _PROTEIN_ of multiple proteins . first we confirmed localization of green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ on the pm in untreated n. benthamiana cells as reported in arabidopsis leaf epidermal cells . then we examined whether dependent internalization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is also observed in this system . upon treatment with dot like structures with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ appeared in the cytoplasm and min after application . a lipophilic dye was also internalized in a similar time frame in n. benthamiana leaf epidermal cells . treatment with the inactive peptide derived from agrobacterium flagellin did not result in accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at the cytoplasmic organelles indicating that specifically triggers endocytosis of _PROTEIN_ in this system . to examine earlier events of endocytosis of _PROTEIN_ in this system we then observed the behavior of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ using a total internal reflection _METHOD_ microscopy related technique called variable angle _METHOD_ microscopy or variable incidence angle _METHOD_ microscopy which enables selective visualization of sample surface regions . _PROTEIN_ signals were concentrated on the pm min after applying and clear punctate signals probably reflecting concentrated or internalized _PROTEIN_ were observed on or near the pm at min . to investigate which organelles are involved in endocytosis of _PROTEIN_ we coexpressed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with monomeric red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or vha _METHOD_ markers of the tgn or with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ markers for the mve because these organelles are known to act as endocytic compartments in plant cells . from to min after treatment _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was observed overlapping or associated with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . by contrast _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was not observed near the _PROTEIN_ compartments after min . for quantitative analysis of this observation we extracted the dot like signals of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and measured the distance from the center of a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ positive dot to that of the nearest _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signal using a framework run on metamorph software which we previously developed . the results were categorized into three groups by distances colocalized associated and independent . we compared results between two groups of samples one was observed from to min after treatment and the other was observed from to min after application _PROTEIN_ . in the early stage and of _PROTEIN_ positive compartments were colocalized and associated with _PROTEIN_ positive dots respectively . in the _PROTEIN_ endocytic stage ratios of colocalized and associated groups were significantly _PROTEIN_ to and respectively . these results suggested that _PROTEIN_ that is internalized upon application transiently localizes at _PROTEIN_ positive compartments in the early stage . intriguingly an experiment using another tgn marker vha yielded a different result . when vha and _PROTEIN_ were coexpressed and treated with we did not observe colocalization of these proteins at any time points after the treatment . the quantitative analysis also supported this observation only and of _PROTEIN_ positive compartments were categorized as colocalized in the early and _PROTEIN_ stages respectively . for further clarification of this result we directly compared subcellular localization of cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and vha _METHOD_ in cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and in which treatment induced endocytosis . _PROTEIN_ and vha positive dots were mostly overlapped however we found that the _PROTEIN_ positive compartments carrying _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not harbor vha _METHOD_ . we also confirmed that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ exhibited the same localization pattern and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and vha _METHOD_ exhibited similar distribution patterns in relation to the _LOCATION_ apparatus visualized with _PROTEIN_ venus . these results clearly indicated that the compartment bearing _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ observed in this study has a characteristic distinct from the tgn in cells where endocytosis of _PROTEIN_ is not induced . we next examined whether _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ an mve localizing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and r snare respectively were colocalized with _PROTEIN_ . these endosomal proteins were localized on _PROTEIN_ positive puncta observed in both early and _PROTEIN_ stages . to investigate the relationship between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ positive compartments in induced endocytosis of _PROTEIN_ we then _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the same cell and compared their subcellular localization after treatment with . at the earlier stage both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were colocalized on the same _PROTEIN_ positive compartments . however after min most _PROTEIN_ localization did not overlap with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ but occurred instead at the _LOCATION_ domains in close proximity to the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ positive domains . after min we did not see colocalization or association of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ while _PROTEIN_ still exhibited good colocalization with _PROTEIN_ . these results indicated the existence of an endosomal compartment involved in triggered endocytosis of _PROTEIN_ that seemed to harbor an intermediate property between the tgn and mve . of interest the colocalization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was observed only at compartments carrying endocytosed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in arabidopsis plants grown under normal laboratory conditions we noted no significant colocalization between the mve and tgn proteins thus far . thus such intermediate compartments might exist only when endocytosis is highly activated . to verify this possibility we compared localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ after treatment between two samples leaf epidermal cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . as observed above of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ positive compartments bore _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells at min after application of this is significantly higher than the ratio of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ compartments with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in cells not _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ after treatment with . these results suggested that the intermediate compartment identified in this study is a transient endosomal structure that is induced when endocytosis is highly activated . under our experimental conditions of _PROTEIN_ positive compartments were classified as associated with _PROTEIN_ positive compartments which indicated that the two compartments were not overlapped but in close proximity _PROTEIN_ of combinations of coexpressed proteins and time points . as described above we found that compartments with intermediate properties between the tgn and mve are involved in ligand induced endocytosis of _PROTEIN_ . to identify molecular machineries that control the trafficking pathway around this compartment we focused our interest on the _PROTEIN_ family because some _PROTEIN_ members have been reported to act in _LOCATION_ trafficking around the tgn although involvement of this family in endocytosis remains unexplored . because of the extreme expansion of _PROTEIN_ members in arabidopsis it is not practical at present to test their involvement in endocytosis of _PROTEIN_ using classical mutant analyses . thus we took advantage of the transient _PROTEIN_ system in n. benthamiana leaf epidermal cells which allowed us to monitor the effect of a dominant negative mutant of a representative member of each _PROTEIN_ subgroup whose _PROTEIN_ was conditionally induced in cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and organelle markers . we created a nucleotide free mutant of each member of the six subgroups of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by replacing invariable asn in the conserved _PROTEIN_ sequence with ile because these mutants have been successfully used as dominant negative _METHOD_ for functional analyses of _PROTEIN_ members in plants . the _PROTEIN_ of the ni mutants was controlled by an estradiol inducible promoter to avoid undesirable effects of the mutant on transport of newly synthesized _PROTEIN_ to the pm . we examined the effects of these mutants on endocytic transport of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ comparing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ subcellular localization with _PROTEIN_ and/or _PROTEIN_ . for induction of mutant _PROTEIN_ estradiol was infiltrated into n. benthamiana leaves and incubated for to h and then samples were treated with . this condition is enough for accumulation of the mutant _PROTEIN_ members as indicated by bright _METHOD_ from venus fused to the mutant _PROTEIN_ members . we examined the effects of _PROTEIN_ of wild type and ni mutants for all six _PROTEIN_ subgroups three of which _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ had no substantial effect on endocytic transport of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mutants of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ did not exert significant effects on endocytosis of _PROTEIN_ and the mutant of _PROTEIN_ had only a marginal effect on colocalization with _PROTEIN_ at the _PROTEIN_ stage . however _PROTEIN_ of ni mutants of the other three _PROTEIN_ subgroups resulted in remarkable alteration in endocytic trafficking of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells we found that _PROTEIN_ colocalized well with _PROTEIN_ even at the _PROTEIN_ stage at which _PROTEIN_ was observed on _LOCATION_ compartments independent of _PROTEIN_ domains in wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells . quantification further indicated that _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ increased colocalization of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ . we found that and of _PROTEIN_ positive compartments in early and _PROTEIN_ stages respectively also bore _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells which was significantly higher than that observed in wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ samples _PROTEIN_ . this result appeared to indicate that _PROTEIN_ acts in trafficking of _PROTEIN_ from _PROTEIN_ positive compartments . we then examined whether _PROTEIN_ also occurs on the _PROTEIN_ positive compartments in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells . we coexpressed _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and mutant or wild type _PROTEIN_ to find that _PROTEIN_ also localized on _PROTEIN_ positive compartments in both cases . these results strongly suggested that _PROTEIN_ did not impair formation of the hybrid compartment bearing _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but did cause delay in transport or transition from the intermediate endosome to the _PROTEIN_ free _PROTEIN_ endosomal compartment which resulted in increased colocalization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in ni mutant _PROTEIN_ cells . intriguingly _PROTEIN_ conferred an apparently opposite effect from _PROTEIN_ . in cells _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ mutant the extent of colocalization between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the early stage was significantly reduced compared with the result from coexpression of wild type _PROTEIN_ . this result appeared to indicate that internalized _PROTEIN_ was not transported to the _PROTEIN_ compartments in mutant _PROTEIN_ cells . however we found that _PROTEIN_ did colocalize with _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells . thus there might be an alternative direct trafficking pathway from the pm to _PROTEIN_ positive mves without transit through _PROTEIN_ positive compartments . these results clearly indicated that two distinct _PROTEIN_ subgroup members _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ regulate different steps in the endocytic pathway of _PROTEIN_ . furthermore the specific effects of these _PROTEIN_ members also demonstrated that the inhibitory effects we observed in these experiments resulted from inhibition of the specific function of each _PROTEIN_ member in n. benthamiana rather than reflecting the effect of titration of general _PROTEIN_ regulators such as _PROTEIN_ guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor . this notion was also supported by the results of coexpression of wild type _PROTEIN_ members with ni mutants . we coexpressed _METHOD_ tagged wild type _PROTEIN_ members with venus _PROTEIN_ or venus _PROTEIN_ for suppression activities for transport defects of _PROTEIN_ in tobacco cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the inhibitory effects of ni mutants were specifically rescued by coexpression of their wild type versions but not by the other _PROTEIN_ members which again indicated specific inhibition of the distinct trafficking event by each mutant _PROTEIN_ as is the case for other plant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we then examined the order of functions of two _PROTEIN_ members _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in endocytic trafficking of _PROTEIN_ by double infiltration of their ni mutants . simultaneous _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ caused the same trafficking defect as _PROTEIN_ . this result strongly suggested that _PROTEIN_ acts in an earlier step than _PROTEIN_ in endocytic trafficking of _PROTEIN_ . the ni mutant of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ exerted another interesting effect . when _PROTEIN_ with this mutant the distribution of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and internalized _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was dramatically changed . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ which presented clear dot shaped signals in wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells was scattered to tiny dots throughout the cytoplasm . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ for which treatment induced endocytosis we observed no dot like signals in the mutant _PROTEIN_ cells but only smear signals that largely overlapped with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . these results indicated that _PROTEIN_ did not block the internalization of _PROTEIN_ from the pm but that the morphology of compartments with _PROTEIN_ to which _PROTEIN_ was transported was severely affected . these findings additionally suggested that _PROTEIN_ of mutant _PROTEIN_ resulted in alteration of the morphology of the tgn . because the tgn also plays fundamental roles in the secretory pathway we then examined the effects of ni mutants of _PROTEIN_ and other _PROTEIN_ subgroups on the steady state localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at the pm . for this purpose chimeric genes composed of a promoter mutant cdna for each _PROTEIN_ member and a terminator were introduced with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ into n. benthamiana cells . among mutants of the six _PROTEIN_ members we examined only _PROTEIN_ caused substantial alteration in _PROTEIN_ distribution . in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ observed as scattered tiny dots throughout the cytoplasm and weak localization to the pm was also visible . moreover constitutive _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ affected distribution of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was also dispersed throughout the cytoplasm as observed in the induced _PROTEIN_ experiment . these results indicated that transport of newly synthesized _PROTEIN_ to the pm was disturbed by defective trafficking around the _PROTEIN_ positive tgn in the mutant _PROTEIN_ cells . we also tested for an inhibitory effect of _PROTEIN_ on transport of another pm protein _PROTEIN_ a boron efflux carrier whose localization is regulated by external boron concentration . steady state localization of _PROTEIN_ was slightly different from that of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was observed on punctate organelles in addition to the pm probably reflecting its constitutive internalization . coexpression of _PROTEIN_ also resulted in alteration of this localization pattern _PROTEIN_ predominantly localized in scattered small dots in the cytoplasm and only weak pm localization was detected in cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . this result again suggested that _PROTEIN_ acts in the secretory pathway . by contrast the ni mutants of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ had no visible effect on presentation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ on the pm . in a similar manner ni mutants of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ caused no substantial change in the pm localization of _PROTEIN_ . the inhibitory effect of _PROTEIN_ in secretory trafficking of _PROTEIN_ was attributable to specific inhibition of the _PROTEIN_ function because estradiol induced coexpression of wild type _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ restored the pm localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . these results again support the specific and distinct functions of _PROTEIN_ subgroups in plant cells . we next asked whether three _PROTEIN_ members with different functions _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ reside on different subcellular compartments or on the same organelle . we thus directly compared the localization of these proteins using combinations of different _METHOD_ proteins . _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ protein tagged _PROTEIN_ members was induced by incubation with estradiol for h. _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ localized at various sizes of dot like structures . these _PROTEIN_ members exhibited good colocalization on comparatively large compartments however they did not overlap at small vesicular structures . this different localization is not due to the difference in fused _METHOD_ proteins because _PROTEIN_ members tagged with different _METHOD_ proteins localized to the same compartments . in arabidopsis root epidermal cells comparatively large compartments bearing _PROTEIN_ partly overlap with the tgn marked by _PROTEIN_ or vha . thus we examined whether _PROTEIN_ members are also localized on the tgn in our experimental system . when coexpressed in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ n. benthamiana leaf epidermal cells venus tagged _PROTEIN_ members and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ frequently colocalized on larger particles while _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ did not target to _PROTEIN_ positive smaller vesicles . the colocalization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was not affected by _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ which exerted inhibitory effects on endocytic transport of _PROTEIN_ . these results indicated that three _PROTEIN_ members localize on different compartments with overlap on the tgn which is consistent with their different functions in transport of _PROTEIN_ .
