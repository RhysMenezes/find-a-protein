lipoxygenases initiate fatty acid oxygenation resulting in the formation of oxylipins activating plant defense against hemibiotrophic pathogenic bacteria . previous studies using nonresponding to oxylipins a series of arabidopsis mutants insensitive to the lox product hydroxy octadecatrienoic acid have demonstrated the importance of cell wall modifications as a component of lox induced defense . here we show that a majority of studied noxy mutants have an added insensitivity to isoxaben an herbicide inhibiting cellulose synthesis and altering the cell wall . the specific mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ insensitive to both hot and isoxaben displayed enhanced susceptibility to pseudomonas syringae as well as reduced activation of salicylic acid responding genes . map based cloning identified the mutation in _PROTEIN_ as _GENE_ encoding an uncharacterized mitochondrial protein designated _PROTEIN_ . moreover _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were mapped at the dynamin related and _PROTEIN_ mitochondria loci respectively . _METHOD_ microscopy and molecular analyses revealed that the three noxy mutants characterized exhibit mitochondrial dysfunction and that hot added to wild type arabidopsis causes mitochondrial aggregation and loss of mitochondrial _LOCATION_ potential . the results suggest that the defensive responses and cell wall modifications caused by hot are under mitochondrial retrograde control and that mitochondria play a fundamental role in innate immunity signaling .
in order to identify signaling components of the hot induced defensive response we made use of _PROTEIN_ a hot insensitive mutant that was isolated in a forward genetic screen based on the root waving activity of hot . this mutant displayed enhanced susceptibility to avirulent and virulent strains of p. syringae reduced activation of hot responses _PROTEIN_ and altered root development . genetic and map based cloning studies indicated that the _PROTEIN_ mutation was monogenic and recessive and was located in _GENE_ encoding an uncharacterized protein that we named _PROTEIN_ . confirmation of this was provided by the complementation of the _PROTEIN_ phenotypic alterations by transformation with a genomic clone of _GENE_ . further data validating the identification of the _PROTEIN_ mutation was the observation that a transfer dna insertion mutant in _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ showed like _PROTEIN_ hot insensitivity and altered root development and that both phenotypic alterations were restored by _PROTEIN_ of a wild type version of _GENE_ under the control of the promoter _PROTEIN_ . studies on the response of plants to hot revealed that the defensive activity of this oxylipin was at least in part due to modification of the cell wall . therefore we examined whether _PROTEIN_ mutants differed from wild type plants in their response to isoxaben a damaging herbicide inhibiting cellulose synthesis and triggering repair processes and up regulation of defense related genes . to this end seeds from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ isoxaben containing medium and examined d after germination . two mutants resistant _PROTEIN_ or hypersensitive _PROTEIN_ to isoxaben respectively were included in these analyses . as shown in figure a and b isoxaben caused growth arrest swelling and ectopic production of lignin in roots of wild type seedlings . as expected no such alterations were observed in _PROTEIN_ plants in which mutation of the cellulose synthase _PROTEIN_ renders an active isoform insensitive to isoxaben . importantly the two _PROTEIN_ mutants showed partial insensitivity to isoxaben . thus whereas isoxaben reduced the length of the primary root of wild type plants by this effect diminished to and in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . in addition microscopy examination revealed that formation of lignin deposits and root swelling in wild type plants in response to isoxaben was much less pronounced in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . in contrast to the results with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants a clear isoxaben hypersensitivity was found in _PROTEIN_ plants in which loss of _PROTEIN_ function caused a cellulose synthase defect and cellulose deficiency . analyses of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by means of promoter gus constructs _PROTEIN_ revealed gus activity in cotyledons and roots of transgenic seedlings and in floral tissues of mature plants . gus staining was primarily localized in vascular tissues _PROTEIN_ root primordia and root _METHOD_ . increased gus staining was apparent in cotyledons and roots of hot or isoxaben treated seedlings . also the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gus was induced in leaves inoculated with the avirulent bacterial strain pst or the virulent bacterium pst as well as in response to isoxaben infiltration whereas no induction was observed in water infiltrated leaves used as a control . examination of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by using semiquantitative reverse transcription pcr revealed the presence of two mrnas designated _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ that accumulated in response to hot bacterial inoculation and isoxaben . cloning and sequencing of the corresponding complementary dnas revealed that these mrnas are splice variants of _PROTEIN_ directing the synthesis of proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with and amino acids respectively . the two proteins were identical in their first amino acids but differed in their c terminal regions . the _PROTEIN_ mrna reached higher levels than _PROTEIN_ transcripts in the three responses examined among which isoxaben caused the stronger induction . the phenotypic alterations and the responses to hot and isoxaben of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were restored by _PROTEIN_ of a wild type _PROTEIN_ cdna under the control of the promoter _PROTEIN_ but not by _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ thus indicating a major role of _PROTEIN_ . in these lines the _PROTEIN_ of the two transgenes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ reached similar levels of accumulation therefore indicating that the failure of _PROTEIN_ to complement the _PROTEIN_ phenotype was not due to low levels of _PROTEIN_ but that _PROTEIN_ is the functional _PROTEIN_ protein . genome analyses indicated that arabidopsis contains _PROTEIN_ homologs sharing to sequence identity with _PROTEIN_ . nine of the _PROTEIN_ homologs identified generate distinct mrna variants encoding proteins that vary in their last amino acids but that are otherwise identical to each other . apart from _GENE_ playing an unknown function in _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ fusion during female gametophyte development no other functions have been assigned to any _PROTEIN_ homolog . protein alignment revealed a highly conserved amino acid region that contains the _PROTEIN_ mutation and might thus be relevant for protein functionality . sequence analyses of _PROTEIN_ indicated the presence of a signal peptide that might target mitochondrial localization . therefore we examined the subcellular location of _PROTEIN_ by generating translational fusions in which the _METHOD_ protein was fused in frame to the c terminus of the _PROTEIN_ cdna . we used the promoter to _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in wild type controls and _PROTEIN_ mutants . the phenotype of _PROTEIN_ mutants was partially rescued by _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was primarily localized to small but distinct regions . parallel staining with mitotracker red a dye that specifically accumulates in the mitochondria revealed that _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ colocalized with the _METHOD_ of mitotracker red indicating that _PROTEIN_ is targeted to the mitochondria . given that _PROTEIN_ was isolated together with additional noxy mutants in a screen for hot insensitive plants we predicted that additional noxy mutations should yield partial insensitivity to isoxaben . therefore we examined the phenotype of noxy mutants grown in isoxaben containing medium . in these analyses we found that of noxy mutants respond like _PROTEIN_ plants with smaller reduction of root length reduced swelling and reduced formation of lignin deposition compared with wild type plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ whereas of noxy plants responded like wild type plants to isoxaben . in addition an intermediate response to isoxaben was found in of noxy mutants that were deficient in lignin deposition and root swelling but otherwise showed a similar reduction in root length as seen in wild type plants _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ that of noxy mutants were partially insensitive to isoxaben indicates that the noxy mutations might impair the ability of plants to activate cell wall repair responses and that the responses to hot share signaling events with those involved in _PROTEIN_ the integrity of the cell wall . the finding that the cellulose deficient _PROTEIN_ mutant like the noxy plants was partially insensitive to hot supported the interplay between the two pathways . . among the hot insensitive mutants characterized above _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respond like _PROTEIN_ to isoxaben and were selected for further examination . since _PROTEIN_ showed enhanced susceptibility to p. syringae infection it seemed likely that also the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations should diminish the defense potential of plants . therefore we examined the phenotype of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for enhanced susceptibility to pst . the _PROTEIN_ mutant was also included in these studies . no major alterations of the plant phenotype except for slower shoot growth compared with the wild type was observed in noxy mutants . three days after bacterial inoculation growth of pst in leaves of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants was higher by _PROTEIN_ of and respectively compared with wild type controls . accordingly _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ showed stronger disease _METHOD_ than those seen in wild type plants . a major signal controlling the activation of plant defense against pst infection is sa . therefore to further characterize the noxy mutations we examined sa dependent gene _PROTEIN_ after sa application . in line with the enhanced susceptibility of noxy mutants transcript abundance of the two sa markers examined _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was lower in noxy mutants than in wild type plants . the diminished capacity of noxy mutants to activate sa mediated up regulation of gene _PROTEIN_ might at least partly explain the reduced defensive potential seen in noxy mutants . moreover the results indicated that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins play a positive role in plant defense where their activity would contribute to the activation of sa dependent defense gene _PROTEIN_ . map based cloning studies indicated that the _PROTEIN_ mutation was located in _GENE_ encoding the dynamin related protein _PROTEIN_ known to localize to the outer surface of mitochondria and to play a key role in mitochondrial fission . the _PROTEIN_ mutation was a g to a transition at nucleotide that converts arg to his at the putative _PROTEIN_ domain of the _PROTEIN_ protein and was renamed _PROTEIN_ . confirmation that _PROTEIN_ impairs mitochondrial fission was obtained by transformation with a mitochondrial yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ marker allowing mitochondrial visualization . thus whereas small and discrete mitochondria were visible in transgenic wild type plants _METHOD_ mitochondria in transformed _PROTEIN_ plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ appear connected to each other forming a network of _METHOD_ elongated mitochondria and large nodule like structures that likely correspond to mitochondrial aggregates . the _PROTEIN_ mutation was mapped at the _PROTEIN_ mitochondria _PROTEIN_ locus a homolog of the clua gene of dictyostelium discoideum encoding a predicted tetratricopeptide repeat protein playing a role in the correct distribution of mitochondria in the cell . the _PROTEIN_ mutation is a g to a transition in the last nucleotide of intron and was renamed fmt . transcripts derived from fmt include intron and are translated into a predicted truncated protein of amino acids lacking the tetratricopeptide repeat domain thought to function in protein protein interactions . the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ is presently unknown however in line with previous reports mitotracker staining of wild type and _PROTEIN_ roots reveals the formation of strong mitochondrial aggregates in _PROTEIN_ plants . because mitochondrial morphology and distribution was altered in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants we examined these organelles in _PROTEIN_ mutants after transformation with the mitochondrial _METHOD_ marker . although most mitochondria showed a wild type distribution and size nodule like structures were visible in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . given that plants integrate mitochondrial signals to regulate _LOCATION_ gene _PROTEIN_ referred to as retrograde signaling we predicted that the mitochondrial alterations in noxy mutants could negatively impact mitochondrial _LOCATION_ communication . to examine this possibility we analyzed the _PROTEIN_ of mitochondrial alternative _PROTEIN_ shown to be under retrograde regulation in response to specific mitochondrial damaging agents such as antimycin a . additionally the _PROTEIN_ of a mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase _METHOD_ controlling ros production was similarly examined . analyses of _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ transcript abundance after antimycin a revealed significant differences between wild type plants and noxy mutants . the level of _PROTEIN_ transcripts reached higher levels in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants than in wild type plants whereas the opposite was observed in _PROTEIN_ . in the case of _METHOD_ we observed a weak induction above basal levels in wild type plants whereas the level of transcripts in the noxy plants examined _PROTEIN_ compared with wild type plants . the results of these analyses indicated that the three noxy mutations characterized caused an alteration in the response of plants to mitochondrial damage and thus that the noxy mutations might disturb mitochondrial functionality . given that noxy mutants disturb mitochondrial morphology and function we examined whether the application of hot might exert any effect on mitochondria . as seen in figure treatment of seedlings with hot provoked mitochondrial swelling and aggregation as well as the formation of mitochondrial structures of annular appearance . clusters of round shaped mitochondria were preferentially seen in the differentiation zone of the roots whereas annular structures were _PROTEIN_ found in hypocotyls . because mitochondrial swelling is frequently associated with a loss of _LOCATION_ potential we also tested whether the application of hot _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ potential of mitochondria . in order to assess this possibility columbia plants _PROTEIN_ the mitochondrial _METHOD_ _METHOD_ marker were stained with tetramethyl rhodamine methyl ester a dynamic reporter of mitochondrial _LOCATION_ potential whose _METHOD_ is spectrally separated from that of mitochondrial _METHOD_ . as expected a red signal colocalizing with the mitochondrial _METHOD_ protein was seen after tmrm staining . the red and green _METHOD_ intensities from individual mitochondria were similar in control untreated samples however an overall _PROTEIN_ of the tmrm _METHOD_ was seen after the application of hot . the reduction of red _METHOD_ indicated that hot caused loss of mitochondrial _LOCATION_ potential and _LOCATION_ depolarization .
