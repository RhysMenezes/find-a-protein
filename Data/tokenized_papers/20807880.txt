pea _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ sorting receptor for soluble proteins and has a _LOCATION_ domain essential for its intracellular trafficking between the trans _LOCATION_ network and the prevacuole . based on mammalian knowledge we introduced point mutations in the _LOCATION_ region of the receptor and produced chimeras of green _METHOD_ protein fused to the transmembrane domain of pea _PROTEIN_ along with the modified _LOCATION_ tails . by analyzing the subcellular location of these chimera we found that mutating glu asp or glu had mild effects whereas mutating the tyr motif partially redistributed the chimera to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . replacing both ile and met by ala _PROTEIN_ led to a _METHOD_ redistribution of _METHOD_ to the _LOCATION_ indicating that recycling is impaired . when the chimera uses the alternative route the _PROTEIN_ mutation led to a _METHOD_ accumulation at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . using arabidopsis thaliana plants _PROTEIN_ a _METHOD_ reporter with the full length sequence of at _PROTEIN_ we demonstrated that the receptor undergoes brefeldin a sensitive endocytosis . we conclude that the receptors use two pathways one leading directly to the lytic _LOCATION_ and the other going via the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and that the ileu met motif has a role in the retrieval step in both pathways .
nine different constructs with selected amino acid substitutions in the _LOCATION_ tail were made from the original _PROTEIN_ chimera _METHOD_ _METHOD_ linked to the transmembrane and _LOCATION_ domains of pea _PROTEIN_ citation . we transiently _PROTEIN_ these constructs in tobacco epidermal cells and observed their _METHOD_ pattern . for the original _PROTEIN_ we found punctate _METHOD_ structures in the _LOCATION_ h after transformation . this labeling appeared at the margins in optical sections through the middle of the cell . in an optical section close to the surface of the cell spots were easy to visualize . one day earlier h after transformation _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ labeling was also visible _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ and disappeared when the fusion protein had reached its final destination . this labeling is typical for this type of fusion protein and has been extensively described previously . the spots are mostly prevacuolar compartments and sometimes colocalize with _LOCATION_ as expected for the tgn . to better delineate the distribution of _METHOD_ we took z series of the outer half of the cell and stacked the images to make a three dimensional projection . we found that in addition to the dominant punctate pattern _METHOD_ could also be detected in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and inside the _LOCATION_ but with intensity that slightly varied between cells and _PROTEIN_ experiments . we therefore quantified in z stacks the average _METHOD_ intensity in each of the three subcellular locations punctate structures _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . this quantification was made on at least independent measurements for each of the three subcellular locations . the average signal intensity obtained for each subcellular location was then _PROTEIN_ relative to the total _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the quantification shown in figure for _PROTEIN_ confirmed that _METHOD_ is mostly in dots . to make sure that this distribution reflects the final destination of the chimera we also quantified _METHOD_ of stably transformed tobacco plants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ construct . indeed in these plants the _METHOD_ was in dots in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and in _LOCATION_ we first _PROTEIN_ chimeras with mutations in each of three acidic amino acids found in the _LOCATION_ tail of _PROTEIN_ . glu is conserved in all plant homologs identified so far . asp is conserved in pea and all arabidopsis homologs while glu is found in pea _PROTEIN_ and its two closest arabidopsis homologs at _PROTEIN_ and at _PROTEIN_ . as shown for in a z stack projection the labeling pattern for all three mutants was similar to the pattern for the _PROTEIN_ control . quantitative intensity measurement confirmed there was no significant difference in distribution except for a _METHOD_ increase in the _LOCATION_ compared with the control . to find out if these mutations modified protein partitioning between the _LOCATION_ and the prevacuole we coexpressed each of the three mutants with the _LOCATION_ marker _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . as expected the _PROTEIN_ construct accumulated _PROTEIN_ in prevacuolar compartments distinct from the _LOCATION_ . the same was true for the two mutants and . by contrast distribution of the mutant protein clearly differed from that of _PROTEIN_ it colocalized almost exclusively with the _LOCATION_ marker . to conclude mutating the acidic amino acids had mild effects on the reporter 's distribution . mutating glu increased _LOCATION_ localization whereas mutating asp and glu only slightly increased exposure of the fusion protein to a lytic environment . to test the role of the tyr motif on the subcellular localization of the reporter we transiently _PROTEIN_ the mutated chimera in tobacco epidermal cells . as shown by a three dimensional reconstruction of labeled cells the distribution of the reporter appeared very similar to the distribution of _PROTEIN_ except that the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ seemed more _METHOD_ than in the control . to confirm this observation we quantified _METHOD_ intensity in the three subcellular locations punctate structures _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . there was indeed almost twice as much _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ compared with the control with no change in the _LOCATION_ . to test the role of the _PROTEIN_ dipeptide we _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ chimera in which both ile and met were mutated to ala . we analyzed the subcellular localization of the _METHOD_ after h of _PROTEIN_ . as shown on figure the distribution of _METHOD_ was drastically different from that of _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ appeared strongly labeled . the _LOCATION_ is visible in negative contrast . quantitatively the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ was times higher than for _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ inside the _LOCATION_ can be explained by cleavage and release of the soluble reporter from the _LOCATION_ bound fusion protein . we noticed that the _LOCATION_ labeling gradually appeared during the transient _PROTEIN_ and peaked at to h after transformation . after only h of transient _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was found in small dots and then _PROTEIN_ concomitantly with the appearance of _LOCATION_ staining . to gain further insights into the nature of these intermediate compartments we coexpressed the _PROTEIN_ construct with the _LOCATION_ reference _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ and observed doubly transformed cells h after transformation when punctate labeling was dominant . as shown in figure the compartments labeled with _PROTEIN_ were almost entirely distinct from the _LOCATION_ . we then coexpressed the soluble reporter cargo aleu _METHOD_ that is transported to the _LOCATION_ by vsrs . this reporter contains the _LOCATION_ sorting signal of petunia aleurain that is sufficient for _LOCATION_ targeting . when _PROTEIN_ in plants this soluble cargo reporter was also found first in small dots that are believed to be prevacuolar intermediates prior to _LOCATION_ delivery . when aleu _METHOD_ was coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ and cells were observed h after transformation _PROTEIN_ and aleu _METHOD_ spots were found to totally colocalize indicating the prevacuolar nature of _PROTEIN_ intermediate compartments . altogether this indicates that mutating the _PROTEIN_ dipeptide strongly affects the reporter distribution _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ localization in favor of prevacuolar localization . prevacuolar _METHOD_ is transient indicating that recycling of the reporter is impaired . we tested the role of the tyr motif in relation to the three acidic amino acids by generating double mutants and then transiently _PROTEIN_ them in tobacco epidermal cells . the double mutants had a pattern of _PROTEIN_ that resembled the nonmutated control _PROTEIN_ . quantification revealed that _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ intensity for all three mutants was actually closer to than to _PROTEIN_ . in contrast with the single mutants and _METHOD_ intensity in the _LOCATION_ did not increase for the corresponding double mutants _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . this indicates that the tyr mutation is dominant and masks the effect of the asp and glu mutations . we then addressed the nature of the dots by coexpression with a _LOCATION_ reference marker and found that the glu mutation caused a redistribution of the marker to the _LOCATION_ as was already observed with the single mutant . because the tyr motif mutation is redirecting receptor trafficking to an alternative pathway this indicates that asp and glu function only in the _PROTEIN_ pathway whereas glu is likely to play a role in both pathways . to address the relative roles of the tyr and the _PROTEIN_ motifs we prepared a corresponding double mutant . we transiently _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ construct in tobacco epidermal cells . the mutant protein showed a major localization at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ with very few intracellular dots . quantification of signal intensity clearly confirmed redistribution of this mutant to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the signal intensity in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was times higher than that for _PROTEIN_ . to ensure that the whole reporter reached the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ we plasmolysed transformed cells and found that labeling remained associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ whereas the _LOCATION_ space was unstained . this confirmed that the _METHOD_ was due to the _LOCATION_ bound reporter and not to a released and secreted core _METHOD_ . the _METHOD_ intensity at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ almost doubled for _PROTEIN_ in comparison to alone indicating that the _PROTEIN_ motif is important for endocytosis . additionally very few spots could also be detected for the _PROTEIN_ reporter . we identified these as being mostly _LOCATION_ or closely associated with it since they colocalized with _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . the _PROTEIN_ that we found very little _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ indicates that the tyr mutation dominates over the retrieval effect of _PROTEIN_ perhaps by preventing the fusion protein from reaching prevacuolar compartments . to find out if the luminal domain of vsrs could have an influence on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization of the reporter we made a fusion protein of the citrine _METHOD_ protein and the full length receptor . we positioned the _METHOD_ reporter between the signal peptide and the rest of the coding sequence of the arabidopsis homolog at _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . this chimera should be functional because a similar construct was able to bind its ligand aleurain in vivo as shown by bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation . the fusion citrine was transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco epidermal cells and its distribution was observed after h of _PROTEIN_ . as shown in figure citrine accumulated in dots and also in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but not in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the partitioning of _METHOD_ among the dots the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ was similar to what was found for the _PROTEIN_ fusion protein . indeed the _METHOD_ intensity in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ reached while it represented roughly without the luminal domain of the receptor _PROTEIN_ . we then addressed the nature of the dots by coexpressing citrine with a _METHOD_ version of _PROTEIN_ . as shown in figure both fusion proteins colocalized . this result indicates that a potentially functional receptor can also be found in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . we next transformed arabidopsis plants with the citrine chimera . we obtained six _METHOD_ lines that all presented a dominant spot like labeling as shown in the root apex . in addition we observed in all plants additional labeling of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . this _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ labeling was not detectable in root apex cells but increased gradually along the root 's longitudinal axis to be clearly visible in the medium part of the root and was dominant in the upper part of the root . in two plants out of six we could barely detect any dot labeling in cells from the upper region of the root . since citrine is _PROTEIN_ using a promoter as a control we determined by immunoblotting the level of protein in comparison to the native receptor . we found similar quantities of the fusion and the native proteins indicating that the _METHOD_ chimera is not _METHOD_ overexpressed . we took advantage of the exclusive _LOCATION_ localization of citrine in the upper root cells to examine the dynamics of its endocytosis and exocytosis . we applied brefeldin a a fungal metabolite used to inhibit vesicular trafficking at the exocytosis/secretion level in presence of the protein biosynthesis inhibitor cycloheximide . in arabidopsis root cells bfa treatment leads to the intracellular accumulation of endocytic material in so called bfa compartments . _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins that undergo bfa sensitive endocytic recycling accumulate in these compartments . since bfa experiments are usually performed with cells close to the root apex we performed a control experiment on the upper root cells _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fusion protein _METHOD_ . as shown on figure upper root cells form typical _METHOD_ containing bfa compartments after bfa treatment as described in apex cells . we therefore performed the same treatment on citrine _PROTEIN_ roots and found a clear accumulation of _METHOD_ in bfa bodies . interestingly while an important fraction of _METHOD_ remained at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ after bfa treatment we observed a strong _PROTEIN_ to full disappearance of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ labeling for citrine . since cycloheximide is depleting the cells in newly synthesized proteins we controlled that labeling of citrine was stable along the duration of the experiment by treatment with cycloheximide alone . the accumulation of citrine in bfa compartments together with a _PROTEIN_ of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ labeling indicates that the receptor undergoes endocytosis . in contrast with the _METHOD_ control we also observed a faster accumulation of citrine in bfa compartments _METHOD_ . we next tested the ability of the receptor to participate in exocytosis by washing off the bfa in presence of cycloheximide . as shown on figures and bfa compartments visible before washing disappeared after removal of bfa while _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ labeling was recovered . this indicates that the receptor can traffic from internal compartments to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in conclusion _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized citrine undergoes bfa sensitive exo and endocytic cycling .
the coding sequence for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was described previously and contains the _METHOD_ reporter followed by the transmembrane and the _LOCATION_ domains of pea _PROTEIN_ . we used the previously described _METHOD_ with the double mutation and . a sali site was created at the fusion between the _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ coding sequences with no change in either one of the two protein sequences and a saci site was added at the level of the stop codon . the resulting coding sequence at the fusion is mdelykstwaaf where the underlined k preceding the transmembrane domain is shared by _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ sequences . point mutations changing chosen amino acids to ala were introduced in the _LOCATION_ sequence of _PROTEIN_ by overlapping pcr . the resulting pcr fragments were verified by sequencing and used to substitute the original sequence using sali and saci sites . this generated nine new constructs coding for proteins with one two or three altered amino acids . the constructs were named according to the point mutations introduced at the level of the _LOCATION_ domain of pea _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and . for easier comparison with published data these numbers correspond to the positions of targeted amino acids in reference to the sequence of the arabidopsis thaliana homolog _PROTEIN_ . all constructs were finally transferred into the binary vector for transient _PROTEIN_ under the control of the strong promoter . a fusion of the citrine sequence with the full length sequence of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ was made by inserting the reporter between the signal peptide and the sequence of the mature at _PROTEIN_ by creating a psti in and a spei in junctions . the resulting fusion was cloned into the gateway vector under the control of a promoter . the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ construct was previously described in citation . aleu _METHOD_ was previously described and a _METHOD_ version was made by replacing the _METHOD_ with an enhanced _METHOD_ sequence . the resulting aleu _METHOD_ carries the signal peptide of tobacco chitinase and the _LOCATION_ sorting propeptide from petunia aleurain fused to the sequence of the reporter . for transient _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaves to week old plants were used . the construct carried by the binary vector was introduced into plant cells via infiltration of a transformed agrobacterium tumefaciens strain as described previously . the agrobacterium suspension was inoculated at a density of in the lower epidermis after making a small lesion to facilitate the infiltration . plants were kept in the dark during _PROTEIN_ to allow optimal visualization of _LOCATION_ labeling . we observed the _METHOD_ to h after transient _PROTEIN_ in tobacco epidermal cells from a small leaf piece cut off the plant and mounted in water between slide and cover slip . arabidopsis was transformed with the floral dip method using the agrobacterium strain . we used either a leica tcs or an inverse axiovert zeiss/lsm meta confocal microscope . for imaging of the coexpression of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ we used a sequential mode with the and nm laser excitation lines from this microscope . in more detail the and nm lines were alternatively switched on to detect the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ respectively . the laser power was set to the minimum required for a sharp but not saturating signal and appropriate controls were made to ensure there was no bleed through from one channel to the other . that is we ensured that the signal collected for one fluorochrome remains unchanged when the laser line used to excite the second fluorochrome was switched off . images were mounted using adobe photoshop software . _METHOD_ was analyzed using the software provided with the confocal microscope . we aimed to obtain quantitative data on the distribution of _METHOD_ in three _PROTEIN_ subcellular locations named punctate structures _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . prior to quantification we controlled that the fusion protein had reached its final destination by the absence of _LOCATION_ labeling in a confocal section through the _LOCATION_ . we first acquired a z series of transformed cells with a z step . laser power was set manually for each single cell at the most _METHOD_ section to get the maximum signal but just below the saturation level . this setting ensures that the _METHOD_ signal is optimal but linear and comparable within different sections of a given cell . regions of interest were then drawn manually at different locations and in different sections of the z series . rois were drawn to contain only _METHOD_ signal from the subcellular location chosen punctate structure _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ content . the mean intensity of _METHOD_ was measured for each roi . this measurement was repeated at least five times for one cell within different z sections . we repeated measurements on to z series coming from three independent transient _PROTEIN_ . the relative distribution of signal within spots _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was then _PROTEIN_ setting arbitrarily as being the sum of the three types of intensity measured . arabidospis plants _PROTEIN_ citrine or _METHOD_ were grown for a week on plates containing half strength murashige and skoog medium . drugs were applied by transferring week old plantlets from the plate on a drop of diluted chemicals . bfa and cycloheximide were both used at a concentration of for times indicated in results . dilution was made freshly from a stock solution in _METHOD_ .
