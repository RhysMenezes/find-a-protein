myosin xi are actin based molecular motors that are thought to drive organelle movements in plants analogous to myosin v in animals and fungi . similar domain structure of these myosins suggests that binding to organelles may occur via the globular tail domain in both types of motors even though sequence similarity is low . to address this hypothesis we developed a structure homology model for the globular tail of _PROTEIN_ a myosin xi from arabidopsis based on the known structure of yeast myosin v globular tail . this model suggested an interaction between two subdomains of the globular tail which was verified by yeast two hybrid assay and by in vivo bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation . interface mapping demonstrated that this subdomain interaction depends critically on the c terminus of helix as well as three specific residues in helices and consistent with the structural prediction . the reconstituted globular tails of several arabidopsis myosin xis in bifc assays targeted to _LOCATION_ in plant cells identifying this domain as sufficient for cargo binding . unlike myosin v either subdomain of myosin xi alone was targeting competent and responsible for association with different organelles . in addition our data suggest that organelle binding is regulated by an allosteric interaction between two tail subdomains . we conclude that the globular tail of myosin xi shares a similar structure with that of myosin v but has evolved plant specific cargo binding _METHOD_ .
the structure of _PROTEIN_ globular tail resembles that of first high resolution structure of a myosin v tail was recently determined for an essential myosin v isoform in saccharomyces cerevisiae . because _PROTEIN_ and share identical domain organization we reasoned that these two classes of myosins might fold similarly . however the sequence similarity of the globular tails of _PROTEIN_ and is quite low and various alignment _METHOD_ recognized only short segments of homology largely confined to the dilute domain . manual re alignment based on predicted secondary structures elevated the sequence identity to and more importantly revealed conserved residues throughout the entire tail except the very c terminal region . notably of the conserved residues are buried inside in structure suggesting that purifying selection was directed at _PROTEIN_ the folding pattern of the globular tail domain in these myosin classes . based on this optimized alignment we used the swiss model server to predict the likely structure of _PROTEIN_ globular tail . the resulting model appeared to be stereochemically robust as judged by ramachandran plot . the root mean square _METHOD_ deviation of the predicted structure relative to the template was small and larger deviations were all confined to loop regions . the predicted general architecture of _PROTEIN_ globular tail is very close to that of although the _PROTEIN_ globular tail model is composed of helices compared with helices for . the predicted extra three helices in _PROTEIN_ are caused by two long insertions relative to the sequence . on the other hand two insertions in are absent from _PROTEIN_ so that _PROTEIN_ is predicted to have shorter loops between helices and and between helices and . it is important to emphasize that these novel features of _PROTEIN_ globular tail are purely predicted and that their actual structure needs to be verified independently . in this study we provide experimental support for the overall conformation of the calculated _PROTEIN_ globular tail structure . myosin xi tail subdomains interact with each other in yeast has been reported that the globular tail of could be divided into two distinct subdomains which tightly associate with each other . the predicted structural similarity suggests that these subdomains _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ also exist in myosin xi and associate similarly . indeed the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ could be detected in a system . similar interactions between the corresponding _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ subdomains from other myosin xi _METHOD_ i.e . _PROTEIN_ xi c and xi k could also be observed . interestingly heterologous interactions between _PROTEIN_ from _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from _PROTEIN_ xi c or xi k were also detected in assay . no interaction between _PROTEIN_ and an intact tail or between two intact tails was found in assays which is consistent with a previous report for . taken together our data imply that the myosin xi globular tail subdomains can associate with each other in a conserved manner as predicted and that the interaction between two tail subdomains occurs only within an individual myosin polypeptide . two regions in _PROTEIN_ tail subdomains are indispensable for the intra tail further verify the structure prediction in detail we created targeted mutations to test specific elements in the _PROTEIN_ globular tail model . according to the structure model the c terminal end of helix from _PROTEIN_ inserts into a pocket formed by a bundle of _PROTEIN_ helices and this interaction may play a pivotal role in the association of the two subdomains . this prediction was tested with two truncations at the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ . the first removed the last twelve amino acids of helix after _PROTEIN_ while the second was truncated right after helix _PROTEIN_ . both constructs were tested by assay for interaction with _PROTEIN_ . as expected keeping intact in _PROTEIN_ retained the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ while the loss of residues blocked the interaction indicating that the c terminal end of helix is required for the association of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . we speculated that the long c terminal extension of _PROTEIN_ after helix which loops back and wraps around _PROTEIN_ would also be necessary to _PROTEIN_ the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . a deletion series _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which respectively lacked or amino acids from the wild type _PROTEIN_ c terminus was created and tested for the interaction with _PROTEIN_ by . intriguingly all truncations except for the shortest one _PROTEIN_ prevent interaction with _PROTEIN_ suggestive of a crucial role for the tetrapeptide . according to the predicted structure this tetrapeptide from helix may interact with its neighboring helices and . removal of helices and _PROTEIN_ from _PROTEIN_ disrupted the interaction with _PROTEIN_ whereas the truncation of helix alone _PROTEIN_ did not impair the interaction with _PROTEIN_ . we concluded that helix is the probable interacting partner of the tetrapeptide in helix . based on the structural model and _PROTEIN_ from helix and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from helix could participate in the interface within this region . to test this prediction we introduced point mutations to replace _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ respectively with alanine . these point mutations could be _PROTEIN_ normally in yeast cells as shown by protein gel blot analysis . only the mutation resulted in a loss of interaction indicative of a key role of _PROTEIN_ in the association of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in contrast the removal of from _PROTEIN_ still permitted the interaction to occur . furthermore double mutation of and _PROTEIN_ on helix also disrupted the interaction indicating that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ form an interacting triad in this region . this was further supported by a negative interaction in a triple mutation of _PROTEIN_ and as well as the conservation of these three residues in all arabidopsis myosin xi _METHOD_ . interaction of globular tail subdomains also occurs in plant confirm our results from yeast two hybrid assays we checked for subdomain interactions in the cytoplasm of plant cells by bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation . the bifc approach relies on the reconstitution of a fluorophore when two halves of the _METHOD_ protein are brought together by an interaction between their fusion partners . reconstituted _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was visualized in a punctate pattern for yn and yc tagged _PROTEIN_ globular tail subdomains in arabidopsis leaf cells irrespective of the fusion orientation . both the _PROTEIN_ yc yn _PROTEIN_ combination and the yn _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ yc combination resulted in clear _METHOD_ signals . however no _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed for the yn _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ yc combination within cells _PROTEIN_ a transformation indicator ruling out the possibility of a spontaneous interaction between yn and yc . similarly restored _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was also visualized in the bifc assay for three other myosin xi _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ xi i and xi k . these findings confirmed that the two tail subdomains of myosin xi interact with each other in living plant cells thus corroborating the structure homology model of _PROTEIN_ globular tail . importantly the reconstituted _METHOD_ signal in the bifc assays localized specifically to _METHOD_ labeled _LOCATION_ for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ xi i and xi k . this result thus established that the reconstituted globular tail is functional and sufficient for organelle binding in plant cells . globular tail subdomains can target different organelles _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ when _PROTEIN_ separately labeled punctate structures which coincided with the _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ marker . _LOCATION_ targeting was not affected by the point mutations that disrupted subdomain interactions in assays suggesting that these residues are only important for intramolecular interactions . curiously the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ chimera of _PROTEIN_ targeted to _LOCATION_ stacks instead of _LOCATION_ in about one fifth of the cells . independent targeting of tail subdomains could also be confirmed in _PROTEIN_ where _PROTEIN_ targeted to unknown organelles which were neither _LOCATION_ mitochondria _LOCATION_ stacks nor prevacuolar compartments while _PROTEIN_ bound to _LOCATION_ . localization of _PROTEIN_ subdomains to small organelles or _LOCATION_ respectively is fully consistent with the distribution of immunodetected native protein and _METHOD_ labeled tail constructs . none of these constructs prevented movement of the targeted organelles which is similar to the lack of a dominant negative effect of other _METHOD_ tail fusions described previously . taken together our results indicated that either subdomain alone could target to organelles thus possessing independent cargo binding sites . myosin xi globular tail requires upstream sequences for proper sought to confirm the specific targeting of myosin xi with full length globular tail constructs _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ but only diffuse cytoplasmic labeling was detected resembling the distribution of _METHOD_ alone . this unexpected distribution could have resulted from incorrect folding of the globular tails . this interpretation was supported by a folding reporter _PROTEIN_ which should mimic the situation of the yn yc bifc combination but that did not result in any detectable _METHOD_ signal within cells containing the transformation indicator . this result may indicate that the intact globular tail does not fold easily into the predicted conformation . interestingly a longer fusion construct that included the entire coiled coil region in addition to the globular tail domain of _PROTEIN_ resulted in localization to organelles some of which could be identified as _LOCATION_ stacks . this result suggested that additional sequences outside the globular tail may be involved in its proper folding .
bioinformatic amino acid sequences of the globular tail of myosin xi _PROTEIN_ and myosin v were initially aligned by muscle and t coffee _METHOD_ . manual refinement was made by considering the known secondary structure of globular tail and the secondary structure of _PROTEIN_ globular tail predicted by the protein homology recognition engine server . based on this sequence alignment and the structure template a homology model of _PROTEIN_ globular tail was built by the swiss model server . the resulting pdb file is available online as supplemental data . the residues buried inside the structure were identified as inaccessible residues by the swiss pdbviewer program using default settings . structural models were drawn with macpymol . plasmid pcr primers used and recombinant plasmids constructed in this study are listed in supplemental tables and respectively which are available online . standard molecular cloning protocols were followed for plasmid construction . for yeast two hybrid constructs the bait plasmids were made by inserting different ncoi/sali digested bait pcr products into similarly cut _PROTEIN_ while the prey plasmids were generated by inserting individual xhoi digested prey pcr products into the xhoi site of pact except that bamhi was alternatively used for the pact _PROTEIN_ construction because of the presence of an interior xhoi site in xi k _PROTEIN_ . plant myosin cdnas used as pcr templates were kindly provided by dr. john schiefelbein for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ or obtained from the est collection at the arabidopsis biological resource center for xi c xi i xi k . if necessary site directed mutagenesis was carried out using the megaprimer method . all _PROTEIN_ constructs used in this study started at and the resulting shortened helix did not appear to affect folding of _PROTEIN_ and interaction with _PROTEIN_ . for bifc constructs the coding sequence for n terminal residues and c terminal residues of _METHOD_ were fused to either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ coding sequences of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ xi i and xi k. the entire _PROTEIN_ cassettes were then cloned into plasmid containing a cauliflower mosaic virus promoter with dual enhancer elements . for _METHOD_ tagging constructs yn or yc moieties in a given _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ construct were replaced by an intact _METHOD_ . a ten residue linker gghhhhhhgg was introduced between _METHOD_ and the myosin tail in bifc or _METHOD_ tagging constructs to prevent potential interference in protein folding of the two parts . all constructs were verified by dna sequencing . yeast two hybrid strain cells were cotransformed with the indicated bd bait construct _PROTEIN_ and the indicated ad prey construct _PROTEIN_ and grown on sd/ trp/ leu plates . single colonies of each transformant were patched onto a sd/ trp/ leu/ his plate containing mm amino triazole _PROTEIN_ which blocks leaky _PROTEIN_ of the reporter gene . the plate was then placed at for days and galactosidase activities for each colony were analyzed by colony lift filter assay . transient _PROTEIN_ in plant green leaves were detached from week old arabidopsis thaliana col plants for tungsten particle mediated bombardment using a _PROTEIN_ system . a construct encoding _METHOD_ with a c terminal type _LOCATION_ targeting signal was co bombarded with bifc constructs as transformation indicator and _LOCATION_ marker . alternatively a construct encoding _METHOD_ with an n terminal _LOCATION_ resident mannosidase transmembrane domain was co bombarded as transformation indicator and _LOCATION_ marker . after bombardment the leaves were kept at in a moist chamber in darkness for h prior to microscopic examination . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ microscopy was performed using an axiovert m microscope equipped with filters for _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . transformed cells were first identified under a objective before representative cells were observed with a plan apo oil immersion objective . images were captured with a digital camera _LOCATION_ controlled by openlab software . photographs were subsequently processed for optimal presentation with photoshop .
