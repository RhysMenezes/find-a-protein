phytochrome regulates various physiological and developmental processes throughout the life cycle of plants . among the members of the phytochrome family phytochrome a _PROTEIN_ exclusively mediates the far red light high irradiance response which is elicited by continuous far red light . in fr hir _LOCATION_ accumulation of _PROTEIN_ which precedes physiological responses is proposed to be required for the response . in contrast to fr red light induces rapid degradation of _PROTEIN_ to suppress undesirable long term photomorphogenic responses of _PROTEIN_ . in the present study we compared biological activities between _PROTEIN_ derivatives to which either a _LOCATION_ localization or export signal sequence was attached . those derivatives were _PROTEIN_ under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter in the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ mutant . detailed microscopic observation revealed that the _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ without a signal sequence is localized exclusively in the cytoplasm in darkness . rapid _LOCATION_ entry was observed after exposure to both red and far red light . interestingly both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ nls and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ nes were rapidly degraded under continuous red light . furthermore a proteasome inhibitor delayed degradation equally under these two conditions . therefore similar _METHOD_ for _PROTEIN_ degradation may exist in the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ . as expected from previous reports _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ nls but not _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ nes mediated different aspects of fr hir such as inhibition of hypocotyl elongation and rapid induction of gene _PROTEIN_ confirming that _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ localization is required for fr hir . in addition a detailed time course analysis of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ nls responses revealed that they were almost indistinguishable raising the question of the physiological relevance of _PROTEIN_ cytoplasmic retention in darkness .
to elucidate the sites of _PROTEIN_ signal transduction and degradation within the cell full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ derivatives with either an nls or an nes were _PROTEIN_ in the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ mutant under the control of the authentic _PROTEIN_ promoter . the resulting lines were referred to as apagl and apage respectively . as a control _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ without a localization signal was _PROTEIN_ in the apag lines . no obvious morphological phenotype was observed when these plants were grown under continuous white light . three day old etiolated seedlings were observed microscopically for _METHOD_ _METHOD_ to select lines _PROTEIN_ higher levels of the introduced proteins . _PROTEIN_ was further analyzed by immunoblotting to finally select and as the _PROTEIN_ representative lines . the correct subcellular localization and size of the introduced _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ derivatives were confirmed by microscopic observation and immunoblotting respectively . the _PROTEIN_ levels were comparable in these lines with that in the wild type . furthermore additional lines such as and were used in some experiments . our _PROTEIN_ promoter driven lines attained higher accumulation levels than previously reported _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants reaching amounts similar to the endogenous _PROTEIN_ . under this premise _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was observed in epidermal cells in the hook region of day old dark grown seedlings . consequently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was dispersed homogenously in the _LOCATION_ but was not detected in the _LOCATION_ . this observation is consistent with reports describing other _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants . by minimizing exposure of the samples to the confocal microscopic laser light formation of cytoplasmic speckles was avoided in samples not treated with light . the _METHOD_ distribution pattern in was indistinguishable from that in . neither _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ nor cytoplasmic speckle formation was observed . it should be noted that the cytoplasmic speckles formed rapidly when apag and apage seedlings were subjected to two or more scans with the confocal microscope laser . as expected the and seedlings showed very intense and even distribution exclusively in the _LOCATION_ even in darkness indicating that the nls was active enough to overcome any activity of _PROTEIN_ for retention in the cytoplasm . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein accumulated in the _LOCATION_ under continuous fr . three day old dark grown seedlings were exposed to continuous fr for various lengths of time and were observed with a confocal laser scanning microscope . exposure to laser light was minimized by scanning only once per sample . as shown in fig . a significant _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ signal was already detected at h under fr in . the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ further increased up to h. the intensity then gradually _PROTEIN_ in both the _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm as previously reported . notably the cytoplasmic signal remained detectable throughout the h fr treatment . as with samples kept in darkness no cytoplasmic or _LOCATION_ speckles were observed in the sample treated with fr for h . semi quantification of the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ indicated that the _LOCATION_ signal was stronger than the cytoplasmic signal at and h in . the apage and apagl seedlings were observed using the same methods . as expected neither the _LOCATION_ signal nor cytoplasmic speckles were observed in . the cytoplasmic signal in gradually _PROTEIN_ as with . in contrast the signal was detected exclusively in the _LOCATION_ in and . notably only a few _LOCATION_ speckles were observed in these lines at h in fr . semi quantification of the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ indicated that _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ was always much higher in than in whereas _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ in was weaker than in at and h in fr . in previous publications relatively rapid _LOCATION_ import of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under fr has been reported . in the present study an ultra fast confocal laser scanning microscope was utilized to examine the _LOCATION_ import kinetics of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at an earlier phase of the light treatment . this microscope enabled recording of z axis frames at intervals within s. the resulting image stacks were inspected to select images in which _LOCATION_ were clearly recognized . in this experiment which showed a slightly higher _PROTEIN_ than was used to observed the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ more clearly . the dark grown seedlings were scanned once irradiated with fr on the microscopic stage continuously and then scanned again . in this way the cytoplasmic and _LOCATION_ levels of _METHOD_ were determined more precisely . consequently _LOCATION_ entry of _PROTEIN_ could be detected as early as min after onset of fr in some of the _LOCATION_ . however the percentage of _LOCATION_ with _METHOD_ signals was low at this time point . after min most of the _LOCATION_ exhibited the _METHOD_ with intensities comparable with that in the cytoplasm . the _LOCATION_ intensity continued to increase and ultimately exceeded the cytoplasmic _METHOD_ at h after onset of the light treatment . both and showed mostly an even distribution of _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ in the dark . the intensity did not change very much in response to irradiation . the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ in remained much higher than in during the course of the experiment . only a few _LOCATION_ speckles were visible in during the h of exposure to fr . the observed _LOCATION_ speckles were smaller in size compared with those described by other authors . _PROTEIN_ is degraded rapidly under light . three day old dark grown seedlings of the present lines were placed under continuous r and observed at different time points . as expected _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ constantly during the course of the treatment . the _METHOD_ disappeared almost completely at h in and . in contrast to the fr treated seedlings clear cytoplasmic speckles were observed at min in . interestingly the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ more rapidly in and . after h under continuous r the _METHOD_ became almost undetectable . these results were further confirmed by immunoblotting . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the cytoplasm and the _LOCATION_ was quantified in and . the log/linear plot of the data showed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was degraded with first order kinetics _PROTEIN_ of its subcellular localization . the apparent half lives calculated from data shown in fig . indicated that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ nls was degraded times more rapidly than _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ nes . to compare the degradation kinetics of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ derivatives and the endogenous _PROTEIN_ proteins were extracted and subjected to immunoblotting . an extract from dark grown wild type seedlings was used as the standard for dilution analysis . the result is presented in the log/linear plot in fig . . as is the case with the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis _LOCATION_ localized _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was less stable than _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized _PROTEIN_ or exclusively in the cytoplasm . it should be noted that endogenous _PROTEIN_ degraded more rapidly than _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in . since the authentic promoter was used in these studies the discrepancy was probably due to the stabilizing effect of _METHOD_ on _PROTEIN_ pfr . it has been suggested that _PROTEIN_ is degraded by the proteasome pathway . indeed a proteasome inhibitor at least partially inhibits _PROTEIN_ degradation . therefore the effects of on _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ degradation were examined in the present lines . as shown in fig . delayed the degradation to some extent _PROTEIN_ of the line examined . hence the degradation in the cytoplasm and the _LOCATION_ could not be distinguished with respect to the sensitivity to the proteasome inhibitor . although _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is degraded after prolonged exposure to r rapid _LOCATION_ import of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ has been reported in the early phase of the dark to light transition . this phenomenon was not clearly observed after h in r in . hence the seedlings were observed at earlier time points using the ultra fast confocal laser scanning microscope . semi quantification of the results indicated that the _LOCATION_ signal increased up to min in which is consistent with the previous report . interestingly these initial import kinetics were very similar to those observed under fr . the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ then started to _PROTEIN_ under r which was opposite to the increase observed under fr . in which is the line that exhibits higher _LOCATION_ abundance rapid _LOCATION_ speckle formation was detected in some cells within min under r . the number and size of visible speckles increased with time . these speckles were bigger in size and more abundant than those few observed under fr . they probably correspond to the _LOCATION_ bodies described in the literature . however similar _LOCATION_ bodies were not observed in suggesting that formation of _LOCATION_ speckles may depend on the local concentration of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ . in order to assess the relationship between the subcellular localization and physiological activity of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ hypocotyl fr hir was examined in the present lines . the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ mutants exhibit the long hypocotyl and closed unexpanded cotyledon phenotype under continuous fr . as expected the parental _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype was fully complemented in with respect to the hypocotyl response . as is the case with the response to fr was slightly enhanced in . however no clear quantitative correlation between the degrees of the response and the levels of _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was observed in these lines . we next asked whether lower levels of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulation in the _LOCATION_ could restore the response . in which accumulated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at a much lower level than the hypocotyl response was significantly weaker than in . the sensitivity was estimated to be reduced several fold in compared with . hence lower levels of accumulation in the _LOCATION_ resulted in reduced sensitivity . in contrast to the apagl lines in which no _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ was observed failed to respond to the fr treatment . it should be noted that displayed a shorter hypocotyl and a more open cotyledon angle even in darkness . the observed dark phenotype could be due to the presence of the active _PROTEIN_ pfr which might be established by the germination synchronization treatment with light . hence we re examined the fluence response curves without the synchronization by light . for this experiment the seeds were treated under green safe light from the beginning of the seed imbibition . in this way we could reduce the dark response in . however the response was not completely abolished . this might be due to sensitized vlfr to the green safe light during seed imbibition . to relate the _LOCATION_ levels of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to the physiological responses more precisely short term responses to fr were examined . chl accumulation and hook opening responses were chosen for this purpose . although chl did not accumulate very efficiently under longer wavelengths of fr the fr light emitting diodes _PROTEIN_ used in the present study contained a certain amount of shorter wavelength light around nm and induced detectable chl accumulation . hence it was speculated that the present fr source promoted both protochlorophyllide accumulation and its photoconversion to chl . as shown the chl level gradually increased in response to continuous fr . the difference between the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ mutant was already obvious by h after the onset of the light treatment . the chl content was higher at this and _PROTEIN_ time points in than in the other lines including and the wild type . as with the hypocotyl response failed to complement the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype whereas the response was significantly weaker than in the other positive lines . we confirmed that the protochlorophyllide levels were similar in those lines in darkness . in the hook opening experiment the angle at the beginning of the experiment was set to zero for each genotype . as with the chl response normal and somewhat enhanced responses were observed in and respectively . in contrast and completely failed to show a response . the above responses proceeded without a lag in the wild type . for unknown reasons a lag of approximately h was observed before the response became detectable in . more importantly a similar lag was observed even in _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ nls was already present in the _LOCATION_ from the beginning of the light treatment . hence the _LOCATION_ entry of _PROTEIN_ did not appear to be a rate limiting step in these responses . the _PROTEIN_ of several genes is induced in an acute and strong manner over a relatively short period of approximately h . the response is almost exclusively mediated by _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are examples of such genes . dark grown seedlings were treated with continuous fr and subjected to quantitative real time reverse transcription pcr analysis . the results showed that similar inductive responses were observed at h in the wild type and whereas neither _PROTEIN_ nor responded to this treatment . these results shared the overall tendency with other physiological responses . however responded almost normally to the light treatment which was different from that observed for the other responses .
the kb promoter region of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ gene was fused to arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ cdna the _METHOD_ cdna and the nos terminator . to localize _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ either inside or outside the _LOCATION_ the nls or nes were fused to the c terminal end of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ respectively . the nls and nes were derived from and pki respectively . the resulting chimeric genes were inserted into the vector and transformed into the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ mutant via agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation . the transformants were selected by antibiotic resistance . homozygous lines were established and used for further analyses . white and r were from white _METHOD_ tubes _PROTEIN_ and red _METHOD_ tubes respectively . r was filtered through a mm plastic plate . fr was from

inorganic salt mixture and gamborg vitamins stratified at in the dark for d exposed to white light for h to induce germination and placed in a growth chamber at in darkness for h. the seedlings were
