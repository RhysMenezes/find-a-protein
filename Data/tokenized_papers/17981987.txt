the _LOCATION_ occupies most of the volume of plant cells thus the tonoplast marker tonoplast intrinsic protein green _METHOD_ protein delineates cell shape for example in epidermis . this permits rapid identification of mutants . using this strategy we identified the cell shape phenotype mutant in arabidopsis thaliana . beyond an absence of lobes in pavement cells phenotypes included reduced trichome branching altered leaf serration and stem branching and increased stomatal density . this result from a point mutation in _PROTEIN_ encoding a conserved amino terminal domain thought to catalyze trehalose phosphate synthesis and a _PROTEIN_ terminal phosphatase domain is catalyzing a two step conversion to trehalose . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ indicates that _PROTEIN_ is an active trehalose synthase . _PROTEIN_ fully complemented defects in csp . mutations in class i genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ indicate a role in regulating starch storage resistance to drought and inflorescence architecture . class ii genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ encode multifunctional enzymes having synthase and phosphatase activity . we show that class ii _PROTEIN_ regulates plant architecture shape of epidermal pavement cells and branching of trichomes . thus beyond a role in development we demonstrate that the class ii gene _PROTEIN_ is important for controlling cellular morphogenesis .
previously we reported a microscopy based screen to identify _LOCATION_ defective mutants using tonoplast marker _METHOD_ fused to tonoplast intrinsic protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . laser scanning confocal microscopy analysis of the cellular phenotype showed that the leaf pavement cells of the parental arabidopsis line _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were typical in having pronounced lobes resulting in a jigsaw puzzle like appearance whereas pavement cells of csp showed either no lobes or lobes that were much less pronounced . in addition to the loss of pavement cell lobes the mutant displayed retarded development which in part may have accounted for a _PROTEIN_ in the size of individual cells in the hypocotyls compared to the parental line . root cells also appeared to be reduced in size . scanning electron micrographs of leaves of the csp mutant and the parental line also clearly highlighted the altered pavement cell shape . interestingly the surface morphology of the mutant cells was more deeply ridged in appearance compared to the parental line . a trichome branching phenotype was obvious in the mutant . in the mutant of trichomes displayed two branches compared to the parental line in which of trichomes had three branches . quantification of individual trichome branches of csp indicated that although the mutant produced fewer branches they were longer than those of the parental line . the mutant displayed more stomates per unit area in csp compared to the parental line indicating an impact on _METHOD_ controlling stomatal density . trichome branch length all measurements se n trichomes for each measurement . for csp branch not observed . parental line is col _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . beyond changes in cellular morphology and stomatal density the mutant displayed retarded development . the stature and morphology of both d old seedlings and adult plants of csp were significantly different from the parental line . the mutant exhibited slow growth at the seedling stage and rosette leaves of the mutant were greatly reduced in size and narrower than the parental line with pronounced serration . mutant leaves displayed strong epinasty . at bolting the mutant showed a greater number of primary shoots than the parental line each of which displayed reduced branching and delayed flowering suggesting a reduction in apical dominance . to understand the basis of the cellular and developmental phenotypes associated with csp we initiated a map based cloning strategy to identify the locus and clone the mutated gene . the mutant in ecotype columbia was crossed to landsberg _LOCATION_ to obtain segregating populations for mapping . individuals from the mapping population were scored for the mutant csp via confocal microscopy . we utilized a high throughput screening method for scoring and screened more than recombinants . in our . in our mapping population csp displayed segregation that was consistent with a recessive mutation . to map the mutation the _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ array was used . the array contained probe sets representing genes . based on hybridization to a pool of recombinants and differences in allelic frequencies we predicted that csp resided on the lower arm of chromosome between and mb with the maximal frequency at mb . we observed a minor statistical peak on chromosome between and mb however we confirmed the position of the csp locus on chromosome between the insertion deletion markers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the position was also confirmed using simple sequence length polymorphism markers on chromosome . the locus was located on bacterial artificial chromosome which was kb in length and contained genes . sequence analyses of all genes revealed a single mis sense mutation at codon of gene _GENE_ . the gene was annotated in the arabidopsis genome database as a glycosyl transferase family protein/trehalose phosphatase family protein similar to tps of yeast . a substitution at nucleotide position resulted in an arg to ser substitution in the protein . comparative analysis revealed that this arg is a unique residue in _PROTEIN_ among class ii tps proteins . the mutated gene in csp encodes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . it has an open reading frame of nucleotides encoding a polypeptide of amino acids . the full length genomic region of nucleotides encodes one exon and no introns . in the arabidopsis genome there are attps genes that are grouped into two classes based on the homology to the tps proteins of yeast . class i consists of four genes containing amino terminal synthase domains and class ii consists of seven genes possessing both amino terminal synthase and _PROTEIN_ terminal phosphatase domains . the _PROTEIN_ protein contains both domains and is thus a class ii tps most similar to yeast _PROTEIN_ and encodes both enzymatic activities necessary for trehalose biosynthesis . by comparison _PROTEIN_ is a class i tps . based on comparisons of the amino terminal synthase and _PROTEIN_ terminal phosphatase regions class i and class ii arabidopsis tps proteins fall into two distinct clades . gene _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was in all organs examined in arabidopsis including seedling rosette leaf cauline leaf flower root and silique . we also analyzed _PROTEIN_ mrna accumulation in csp and the transcript was detected in the mutant suggesting that the mutation altered protein function but did not alter gross gene _PROTEIN_ . yeast _PROTEIN_ encodes a tps whereas _PROTEIN_ encodes a _PROTEIN_ . a _PROTEIN_ mutant can not grow on glc as a _PROTEIN_ source because trehalose is necessary for the regulation of glycolysis by negatively regulating hexokinase ii in vivo . a _PROTEIN_ deletion mutant in yeast showed reduced trehalose accumulation and an accompanying increase in thermosensitivity . because _PROTEIN_ possessed both synthase and phosphatase domains we hypothesized that it would complement both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ deletion mutant phenotypes in yeast if fully functional . indeed _PROTEIN_ complemented the glc sensitivity of the synthase deficient mutant _PROTEIN_ and thermosensitivity of the phosphatase deficient mutant _PROTEIN_ of yeast . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is a multifunctional enzyme encoding functional synthase and phosphatase domains . the complete _PROTEIN_ coding region plus and regulatory regions _PROTEIN_ was amplified using gene specific primers from genomic dna and cloned into a modified gw binary vector . the construct was used to transform csp mutant plants for complementation . several transgenic lines were isolated that were kanamycin resistant and displayed complete restoration of pavement cell morphology when compared to csp and similar to the parental line . also restored were normal leaf shape growth and typical trichomes with three branches . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ complemented the cell shape defects and overall growth phenotypes displayed by the csp mutant . we concluded that _PROTEIN_ plays a significant role in modulating cellular shape as well as growth and development in arabidopsis . a t dna insertion mutant from the salk collection was characterized at the molecular and phenotypic levels . genotyping of csp using the left border primer and a gene specific reverse primer indicated the position of the insertion in _PROTEIN_ . the t dna insertion was in the exon at position nucleotides within the synthase domain and abolished _PROTEIN_ mrna accumulation as evidenced by semiquantitative rt pcr analysis . pavement cells were stained with . this dye which stains the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ endomembranes and _LOCATION_ will also bind to the cell wall conveniently outlining cell shape . this staining revealed a cell shape defect in csp similar to that observed in csp . interestingly the csp loss of function mutant did not display other developmental leaf phenotypes such as pronounced serration epinasty and reduced trichome branching as observed in csp . this indicated that control of cell shape was separable genetically from developmental defects such as leaf morphology and _PROTEIN_ of the mutated gene and complete loss of function resulted in cell shape defects . loss of function mutants in the remaining class ii attps genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were also stained with and revealed no cell shape defects as observed in the _PROTEIN_ mutants csp and csp . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is unique among class ii attps genes in affecting the cell shape of leaf pavement cells . to further investigate the role of _PROTEIN_ in development the coding region of _PROTEIN_ was overexpressed in arabidopsis under the control of the constitutive promoter . the overexpression lines displayed an increase in _PROTEIN_ transcript as detected by multiplex semiquantitative rt pcr . the phenotypes displayed by eight independent lines overexpressing _PROTEIN_ were striking and related to those displayed by csp . for example at weeks old the rosette leaves and overall stature of the plants were significantly greater than those of the parental line . in addition to these developmental phenotypes the trichomes of all overexpression lines displayed an increased number of trichome branches ranging from four to six compared to the parent which displayed three branches . the independent lines displayed a range of related phenotypes correlated with their levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we classified these lines into two general categories . for lines in category the greatest amount of transcript was detected as well as a dramatic increase in the overall size and number of rosette leaves and fewer bolts suggesting an increase in apical dominance . among category overexpression lines there was a more modest increase in _PROTEIN_ resulting in fewer leaves each having reduced serration compared to category mutants . overall growth was also slower than that of the category lines . there was an apparent reduction in apical dominance as evidenced by increased primary shoots emerging from the rosette . there was also an increased number of flowering branches with altered leaf _PROTEIN_ compared to the parental line . overall these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ plays a role not only in establishing cellular morphology but also in the overall growth and morphology of the organism .
