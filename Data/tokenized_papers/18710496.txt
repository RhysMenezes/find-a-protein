in arabidopsis six genes group into the gene family of the organic cation transporters . in animals the members of the oct family are mostly characterized as polyspecific transporters involved in the homeostasis of solutes the transport of monoamine neurotransmitters and the transport of choline and carnitine . in plants little is known about function localisation and regulation of this gene family . only one protein has been characterized as a carnitine transporter at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ so far . we localized the five uncharacterized members of the arabidopsis oct family designated via _METHOD_ fusions and protoplast transformation to the tonoplast . _PROTEIN_ analysis with rna gel blots showed a distinct organ specific _PROTEIN_ pattern of the individual genes . with reporter gene fusion of four members we analyzed the tissue specific distribution of and . in experiments with salt drought and cold stress we could show that _PROTEIN_ and are up regulated during drought stress _PROTEIN_ and during cold stress and atoct and during salt stress treatments . localisation of the proteins at the tonoplast and regulation of the gene _PROTEIN_ under stress conditions suggests a specific role for the transporters in plant _PROTEIN_ to environmental stress .
in silico analysis of the atoct protein sequences predicted _LOCATION_ proteins with transmembrane domains . the protein structures of five atocts are quite similar whereas the structure of the _LOCATION_ localized _PROTEIN_ differs in the n terminal region . however the subcellular distribution of the proteins is still unclear although several prediction programmes like aramemnon were used . to discover the subcellular distribution we fused the open reading frames of all the family members translationally to _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ the proteins transiently in protoplasts . as a control _PROTEIN_ was used for localization to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as shown before . as expected _PROTEIN_ ended up in the _LOCATION_ whereas all the other five members _PROTEIN_ localized to intracellular _LOCATION_ most likely the tonoplast . for verification of the tonoplast localisation an osmotic shock was applied to release the _LOCATION_ from the protoplasts . in the right part of figure tonoplast pictures or tonoplasts escaping from the _LOCATION_ are shown . for all five fusion proteins of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the signal is associated with the tonoplast . subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ using cdna _METHOD_ fusions and protoplast transformation . left part subcellular localisation studies of atoct _METHOD_ fusion proteins . oct proteins were fused with _METHOD_ at the c terminus and _PROTEIN_ transitionally in protoplasts of arabidopsis col cell cultures . protoplasts _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ protein under the control of the camv promoter were used as control . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected throughout the _LOCATION_ . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and the bright field image were overlayed in the right panel . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as shown before . fusion proteins of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were localized at _LOCATION_ in the protoplasts most probably at the tonoplast . right part to confirm the assumed _LOCATION_ localisation _LOCATION_ were released by an osmotic shock from the protoplasts . _METHOD_ signal of the fusion proteins of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is detected at the free _LOCATION_ or at _LOCATION_ just escaping from the protoplasts . free _METHOD_ signal is localised to the _LOCATION_ . rna gel blot analysis showed an _PROTEIN_ of the five _LOCATION_ atocts in a distinct organ specific manner _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is in genera lweakly _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ mrna was only present in siliques but here in a higher amount . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ mrna was strongest in roots and also showed a very faint background _PROTEIN_ in the other organs . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is strongest in sink leaves and source leaves . together with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was the second gene _PROTEIN_ predominantly in roots and weakly in the stem . to analyze the tissue specific _PROTEIN_ of the atocts promoter gus fusions for _PROTEIN_ and were constructed and transformed in arabidopsis . _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ in flowers was restricted to pollen grains and the stigma _PROTEIN_ . gus activity was detected in the vascular tissue of older siliques and also in the envelope of young siliques . staining of the whole rosette revealed a leaf age dependent _PROTEIN_ pattern . in young leaves the whole leaf blade except the vasculature was stained . cross sections showed that the staining is located in the upper epidermis and the cell layer below . at the inner part of young leaves the staining is in the parenchyma cells below the vasculature . in mature leaves _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ was only detectable in the phloem . in roots _PROTEIN_ located to the two vascular strands the initiation site of _PROTEIN_ roots and at the root tip . in _PROTEIN_ gus plants _PROTEIN_ in the siliques was _PROTEIN_ found in young seeds but not in the envelope or in older seeds . strong gus activity was visible in the stem and cross sections localized the staining to cortical cells and parenchyma cells below the cortex . furthermore gus activity was also high at the basis of secondary inflorescences . in leaves _PROTEIN_ was found in the lower and upper epidermis and at the base of the trichomes . similarly to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ gus was detected in young siliques and the vascular tissue of the siliques and not in the seeds . a strong signal of _PROTEIN_ gus was also detected in the _METHOD_ of secondary inflorescences which appears to be in the phloem cells and xylem parenchyma cells . related to _PROTEIN_ gus plants for _PROTEIN_ gus plants a strong staining in plants was detected in the stem of secondary inflorescences which could be localized to the phloem . in flowers _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ was found in the stamen in the filaments and the connective . in rosette leaves _PROTEIN_ is restricted to the major veins of mature leaves . tissue specific gus activity under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter . gus plants show staining in the basal part of the stem and in seeds in young siliques only but not in mature seeds . cross section of the stem localized the staining to the epidermis and parenchyma cells below the epidermis . the _METHOD_ of secondary inflorescence show strong staining . in leaves staining was visible throughout the leaf blade and the basis of trichomes cross section of a leaf shows gus signal at lower and upper epidermis . tissue specific gus activity under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter . in the stem of _PROTEIN_ plantsgus activity was weak a stronger signal was present in the stem of secondary inflorescences . in the flowers gus activity can be found in young siliques . opening of the siliques reveals that the staining is restricted to the veins of young and mature siliques . cross sections of the stem localize the staining to the phloem and cells medial to the xylem . in rosette leaves gus activity can be found in the vasculature . tissue specific gus activity under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter . an overview of the stem shows staining of secondary inflorescences and flowers . close up reveals gus activity in the filaments and the tip of the filaments and the connective tissue . close up of the stem shows stripes along the stem and a cross section localizes the gus staining to the phloem . in rosette leaves gus activity is restricted to the major vein . since the _LOCATION_ is involved in many processes related to osmoregulation and homeostasis of solutes we tested whether the _PROTEIN_ of the atocts responds to stress situations that are known to affect the homeostasis of the _LOCATION_ . cold drought and salt stress induce processes that involve the _LOCATION_ as an important buffering `` tank '' . in the stress experiments we could show that the _LOCATION_ atocts respond differentially with enhanced _PROTEIN_ in timing and strength to the treatments . drought stress causes a rapid increase of _PROTEIN_ and transcripts within minutes of the initiation of desiccation . a maximum _PROTEIN_ level was reached h after the start of treatment . _PROTEIN_ and gene _PROTEIN_ was not induced after drought . cold treatment of the seedlings resulted in an increased _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ and again within minutes . _PROTEIN_ and do not respond to cold stress treatment . in the salt stress experiment timing of the induction is slower but here _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respond with increased _PROTEIN_ levels six hours after exposure to salinity . _PROTEIN_ and do not respond and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is increased after h and _PROTEIN_ with a second peak after h. in all three experiments _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ responds with the strongest increase of transcript levels . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is only increased during cold stress treatment . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ localized member of this family is not induced after the stress treatments but rather reduced upon drought and salt stress . specific _PROTEIN_ of _LOCATION_ atocts during drought cold and salt stress . a _PROTEIN_ of atocts in response to drought stress . _PROTEIN_ was monitored in seedlings at indicated time points by rna gel blot analysis . minutes after initiation of desiccation transcripts of _PROTEIN_ start to accumulate over a period of hours with a maximum around hours . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respond with a strong accumulation of transcripts whereas _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ do not respond at all . b _PROTEIN_ of atocts in response to cold stress . _PROTEIN_ was monitored in seedlings at indicated time points by rna gel blot analysis after transfer of seedling to . increased levels of transcript were found minutes after induction for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with a transient increase over hours and _PROTEIN_ after hours . _PROTEIN_ and do not respond to cold stress . c _PROTEIN_ of atocts in respond to salt stress . transcripts of _PROTEIN_ and respond to salt stress _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ shows a maximum level of transcripts after hours and _PROTEIN_ after hours . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and does not respond to salt stress .
