_LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins are displayed through diverse _METHOD_ including anchoring in the _LOCATION_ leaflet via glycosylphosphatidylinositol molecules . gpi anchored _LOCATION_ proteins are a functionally and structurally diverse protein family and their importance is well recognized as they are candidate cell surface biomarker molecules with potential diagnostic and therapeutic applications in molecular medicine . gpi aps have also attracted interest in plant biotechnology because of their role in root development and cell remodeling . using a shave and conquer concept we demonstrate that phospholipase d _PROTEIN_ treatment of human and plant _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fractions leads to the release of gpi anchored proteins that were identified and characterized by capillary liquid chromatography and tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . in contrast to phospholipase c the _PROTEIN_ enzyme is not affected by structural heterogeneity of the gpi moiety making _PROTEIN_ a generally useful reagent for proteomic investigations of gpi anchored proteins in a variety of cells tissues and _METHOD_ . a total of human gpi aps and arabidopsis thaliana gpi aps were identified representing a significant addition to the number of experimentally detected gpi aps in both species . computational gpi ap sequence analysis tools were investigated for the characterization of the identified gpi aps and these demonstrated that there is some discrepancy in their efficiency in classification of gpi aps and the exact assignment of sites . this study highlights the efficiency of an integrative proteomics approach that combines experimental and computational methods to provide the selectivity specificity and sensitivity required for characterization of post translationally modified _LOCATION_ proteins . keywords post translational modification gpi anchor _LOCATION_ protein subproteome modification specific proteomics _METHOD_ _METHOD_ glycosylphosphatidylinositol specific phospholipase d
release of gpi anchored proteins by phospholipase d. the concept of modification specific proteomics encompasses the integration of techniques to provide selectivity specificity and sensitivity for detection of a distinct class of post translationally modified in the present study we used _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ preparation methods and the enzyme phospholipase d to achieve high selectivity toward _LOCATION_ associated gpi aps from human cell culture and from a. thaliana cell culture . next _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis by capillary _METHOD_ provided high analytical sensitivity and specificity for protein identification . finally computational sequence analysis provided further specificity to validate bona fide gpi aps and to eliminate false positive assignments . we modified the analytical strategy for proteomic analysis of gpi anchored proteins that was previously introduced by our the _PROTEIN_ enzyme was used instead of the _PROTEIN_ plc enzyme to release gpi aps from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fractions in the presence of detergent . _PROTEIN_ enzyme treatment in a triton x suspension at followed by two phase partitioning of the _LOCATION_ proteins and soluble proteins at was applied to the analysis of raft enriched _LOCATION_ fractions from h. sapiens or microsome preparations from a. thaliana . the _PROTEIN_ enzyme hydrolyses the glycosylphosphatidylinositol releasing the soluble gpi protein from the _LOCATION_ phase and enabling its recovery in the aqueous phase . without a priori knowledge of the anchor _METHOD_ of gpi aps present we expected that _PROTEIN_ would be able to access most of the gpi aps present in the _LOCATION_ . control experiments were conducted using no treatment or commercially available _PROTEIN_ plc as previously protein samples isolated in this way were concentrated by precipitation and a fraction was separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . silver staining of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gels demonstrated that a range of proteins were selectively recovered after _PROTEIN_ treatment of human raft enriched _LOCATION_ protein samples and plant _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ preparations . it was clear that both _PROTEIN_ and plc treatment generated a range of proteins in the soluble fraction as compared to the untreated control . in our previous proteomic study of gpi we used western blotting by anti cross reacting determinant to confirm the release of gpi aps upon _PROTEIN_ plc treatment . however _PROTEIN_ cleaves at a different site than plc and the residual gpi anchor is not recognized by the anti cross reacting determinant antibody and so this method was omitted in the present study . protein identification by tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and sequence database searching . . identification of gpi aps in a human lipid raft enriched fraction . proteins recovered after _PROTEIN_ treatment of the human lipid raft enriched sample were identified after tryptic digestion of the protein precipitate or after _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ separation and in gel digestion of proteins . nine protein bands were excised from the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gel containing the gpi ap enriched fraction from human rem fractions as indicated in figure panel a . recovered peptides were analyzed by capillary hplc interfaced to electrospray ionization quadrupole time of flight tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and the peptide tandem _METHOD_ spectra submitted for database searching . for example figure shows two tandem _METHOD_ spectra obtained from protein band that were assigned to the tryptic peptides venqvlsvr and lqdasaever from bone marrow stromal antigen . when a criteria of having at least two peptides matched to accept a protein identification was used a total of proteins were identified by _METHOD_ of peptide samples obtained by in gel and in solution digestion of the _PROTEIN_ treated human _LOCATION_ protein sample . to further evaluate these protein sequences we used computational sequence analysis tools to distinguish genuine gpi aps from proteins that were released or leaked from _LOCATION_ independent of _PROTEIN_ enzyme treatment . three gpi ap prediction _METHOD_ were investigated including big _PROTEIN_ dgpi and gpi _PROTEIN_ . as the result protein sequences were assigned as gpi aps by at least two of the three prediction tools whereas of the proteins were disqualified based on the lack of the required amino acid sequence features . these latter proteins are probably present in the soluble fraction due to release from the _LOCATION_ fraction by residual proteolytic activity or due to leaking as a result of high abundance . these experiments demonstrate for the first time that _PROTEIN_ is a useful and efficient enzyme for the proteomic analysis of gpi aps in human _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ preparations . eleven out of identified human proteins were bona fide gpi aps and they currently represent the largest set of human gpi aps found in a single proteomic experiment . in contrast a proteomic analysis of lipid rafts revealed only gpi aps among authentic lipid raft thus the present modification specific strategy for determination of gpi aps is significantly more efficient and sensitive than standard proteomics methods that do not target particular types of modified _LOCATION_ proteins . we also conclude that it is preferable to use several independent computational sequence analysis tools for validation of gpi anchored protein assignments . several interesting observations were made during data analysis and interpretation . we previously identified mesothelin/megakaryocyte potentiating _PROTEIN_ in the plc released however at that time the _METHOD_ predicted the sequence database entry as a clear non gpi ap and we considered the protein a contaminant . the database entry represents the soluble form of mesothelin/megakaryocyte potentiating _PROTEIN_ . in the present study we identified this protein by sequencing of four peptides in the _PROTEIN_ released fraction . submitting the pre pro megakaryocyte potentiation _PROTEIN_ sequence or mesothelin all of which contain the sequence covered by the identified peptides the protein is recognized as gpi ap by all three predictors . bone marrow stromal antigen was recognized as gpi ap by all three predictors but at the same time it contained a transmembrane domain close to its terminus as revealed by the das tm filter .citation the observation of both an terminal transmembrane domain and a gpi anchor in the same protein is in agreement with another report for rat bst citation and the same features were also found in a minor but pathologically important isoform of the prion protein and in a plant protein involved in disease resistance _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ that we observed this protein in the _PROTEIN_ treated sample from human rem fraction indicates that the transmembrane domain of the bst protein was proteolytically removed . otherwise the protein would remain associated with the _LOCATION_ fraction of the two phase system . . identification of gpi aps in a. thaliana _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ preparations . the growing importance of gpi aps in plant biology is reflected in recent and genetic studies of gpi ap from a. thaliana.citation we therefore investigated whether _PROTEIN_ is applicable to proteomic analysis of gpi aps in the plant a. thaliana . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ separation demonstrated specific enrichment of proteins after _PROTEIN_ treatment of a. thaliana _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein preparations . _METHOD_ analysis of peptide mixtures obtained by in gel digestion or in solution digestion of protein leads to the identification of individual proteins . we noted that an additional proteins were identified by one peptide sequence match only . the tandem _METHOD_ spectrum corresponding to the tryptic peptide sdgggvfeildr is shown in figure panel b . the very good quality _METHOD_ data and the high _METHOD_ accuracy and _METHOD_ resolution of the qtof _METHOD_ spectrum enabled unambiguous identification of this protein as plc x domain containing protein . we then used the three different gpi ap prediction tools and published to validate the assignment of gpi aps in the dataset . the plc x domain containing protein _GENE_ was recognized as gpi ap by the dgpi gpi _PROTEIN_ and big pi _METHOD_ but not by the predictor by borner et among the proteins identified by at least two _METHOD_ based peptide sequence matches a total of were recognized as bona fide gpi aps again demonstrating the high selectivity specificity and sensitivity of the modification specific approach to proteomics . among the proteins that were identified with high probability by only one _METHOD_ based peptide match an additional gpi aps were assigned . the set of gpi aps were validated by high probability scores by at least two of the computational techniques . furthermore of these gpi aps were assigned as such by three independent computational methods . the highest amino acid sequence coverage was obtained for the reticuline oxidase like/fad binding domain containing protein and the _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ suggesting that these proteins are the most abundant in the preparation . five gpi aps were detected experimentally for the first time including fasciclin like protein _PROTEIN_ aspartyl protease like family protein glycero phosphodiesterase like protein _PROTEIN_ and two _PROTEIN_ . reticulin oxidase like protein/fad binding domain containing protein was previously described as a major contaminant protein that co purifies when using the triton x two phase separation in combination with _PROTEIN_ plc and it was detected in plant we now assign this protein as a true gpi ap since a revised amino acid sequence extended by amino acids has emerged in the database . as a result dgpi and gpi _PROTEIN_ recognize _GENE_ as a gpi anchored protein .
