the functions of two genes whose _PROTEIN_ provides tolerance to aluminium stress were investigated using plants and saccharomyces cerevisiae the arabidopsis thaliana blue copper binding gene _PROTEIN_ and nicotiana tabacumguanosine diphosphate dissociation inhibitor gene . to determine the localization of these proteins each gene was fused to the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ gene and introduced into onion epidermal cells . _PROTEIN_ was localized to cell _LOCATION_ region and to cytoplasm . transgenic lines over _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ gene showed constitutive lignin production in whole roots . by contrast wild type arabidopsis produced a negligible level of lignin and enhanced lignin production in the root tip region by al stress . compared with ler the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines showed a lower deposition of malon dialdehyde after al stress . microscopic observation of the al treated roots indicated that the deposition of lipid peroxides was clearly low in the area where lignin accumulated . it was proposed that lipid peroxidation caused by al stress was diminished by the formation of lignin . _PROTEIN_ of the gene in yeast complemented the temperature sensitive phenotype of a mutant at . this gene also complemented an al sensitive phenotype shown by the mutant at the permissive temperature of . these results suggested that the yeast vesicle transport system has a function in providing basal al resistance in yeast by the export of al ions . it was also proposed that over _PROTEIN_ of the protein activates an al efflux system that protects arabidopsis against al toxicity .
the computer program psort _METHOD_ predicted that the _PROTEIN_ protein and the protein probably exist in the cell _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ respectively . to confirm these predictions _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were introduced into onion epidermal cells for transient _PROTEIN_ . as a control experiment the plasmid carrying the _METHOD_ gene _PROTEIN_ was also introduced into onion cells . _METHOD_ microscope observation of the control transformants indicated that the _METHOD_ signal derived from the _METHOD_ gene was seen in the cytoplasm and in the _LOCATION_ with a strong signal . compared with these patterns the transformed cells carrying the _METHOD_ gene showed a lower signal in the cytoplasmic region but a stronger signal in the cell _LOCATION_ region . _METHOD_ signals were observed as particles in the transformed cells carrying the _METHOD_ gene . when these particles were observed under simultaneous light and _METHOD_ conditions all of the particles were detected in the cytoplasmic region and on the inside of a cell _LOCATION_ . no signal was detected in the _LOCATION_ in these two fusion constructs . these results are consistent with the prediction by psort . it has been reported that the _PROTEIN_ gene functions in electron transfer in photosynthesis and in lignin metabolism . to determine whether the _PROTEIN_ gene is actually related to lignin metabolism in plants lignin content in al treated whole roots of a control line and the transgenic plants over _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ was determined . no significant difference in lignin content was seen between individual lines in the absence or presence of al . however lignin content in the two over _PROTEIN_ lines was always higher than that in ler . this result strongly suggested that the _PROTEIN_ gene is related to lignin sysnthesis and that over _PROTEIN_ of the gene induces deposition of excess lignin in roots . furthermore lignin content in root tips was observed by microscope after phloroglucinol staining which specifically detects lignin formation . untreated roots of ler showed no staining while al treated roots were stained red especially in the swollen region and its neighbouring area . in the transgenic lines over _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ gene red areas due to lignin formation were observed independent of the al treatment . these results suggest that lignin formation constitutively occurs in the root tip region as well as in the whole root in these lines . the results of the _PROTEIN_ no . line are shown in fig . . this result also suggested that the _PROTEIN_ gene is involved in the biosynthesis of lignin . the red areas were _PROTEIN_ seen in the central cylinder zone of these two lines but not at the surface of the roots . what is the function of the lignin deposition in al treated roots ? to address this question localization of al ions lipid peroxides and lignin were determined in the same al treated roots by morin and phosphoglucinol respectively . untreated roots of the control line and the _PROTEIN_ over _PROTEIN_ line showed very low _METHOD_ signals by morin or staining . both of the lines treated with al for h showed morin specific _METHOD_ signals in their root tips . a deposition of peroxides derived from al stress was also observed in almost the same area where the al ions accumulated . in this stage a deposition of lignin in al treated roots of the control line was not observed but a small amount of lignin was visible in the _PROTEIN_ over _PROTEIN_ line . after exposure to al treatment for h stronger morin specific _METHOD_ signals were observed in wider areas of both lines indicating that many more al ions were incorporated during the h. a more severe and wider staining pattern by was also observed in the same roots of both lines but the area was no longer consistent with the staining pattern by morin . these results indicated that the oxidative damage had probably spread out to surrounding areas at this stage . deposition of lignin was clearly seen in both lines after h exposure to al stress . it is notable that the areas accumulating high amounts of lignin showed a low accumulation of reactive peroxides in the same roots . accumulation of lipid peroxides in the root was also estimated by mda which is a final product of lipid peroxidation . there was no difference in the content of mda among the three plants _PROTEIN_ without al . all of these plants showed an increase of mda after an exchange to a fresh medium and another additional increase of mda after al stress . however compared with the control line transgenic lines over _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ gene clearly showed a lower increase of mda after these two treatments . the yeast mutant was isolated as a temperature sensitive mutant of a vesicle transport system the mutant is active at but inactive at . these authors also reported that the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ gene can complement the temperature sensitive phenotype of the mutation in yeast cells . these results led to the hypothesis that the gene _PROTEIN_ can also complement the mutation and has a similar function to the gene in yeast . the wild type cells carrying could form colonies at and while the mutant carrying formed colonies at but not at . on the contrary the mutant carrying the gene could partially form colonies at the both temperatures like the cells . this result indicated that the gene could complement the temperature sensitive phenotype of the mutation . to determine whether the gene is related to an al resistance mechanism in yeast al sensitivity of the mutant was investigated . a preliminary experiment indicated that the mutant carrying can not form colonies at but formed almost similar sized colonies at as at . al sensitivity tests for the mutant were therefore performed at both the permissive temperatures . as the al concentration increased from to the wild type strain carrying showed a slight growth inhibition . however there was no difference in colony size between and . the mutant carrying showed a similar al sensitivity to the strain at but was more sensitive at where it formed much smaller colonies in al and no colonies at al . this result indicates that the protein is related to an al resistance mechanism in yeast . another al sensitivity test was performed for the mutant carrying the gene . the temperature dependent al sensitive phenotype of the mutant was partially recovered by the gene and the transformant carrying this gene could form colonies under al stress . furthermore spontaneous segregants isolated from the transformant carrying showed a similar al sensitivity as the parental mutant _PROTEIN_ again . this result provided further support for the conclusion that the gene ameliorates al toxicity in the mutant . to confirm the function of the protein in al resistance mechanism al content of the mutant and the parental strain during both al uptake and al release were determined at . the mutant showed almost the same al uptake to the wild type strain while it showed a slower _PROTEIN_ of al content than the parental strain during the al release period . these results suggested that the mutated protein has an impaired function in vesicle transport as compared to the wild type protein at . to determine whether the dependent resistance mechanism is specific for al stress or not a sensitivity test for another trivalent cation lanthanium was also performed . the strain carrying showed a similar colony formation capability from la treatment at and . the mutant carrying showed a growth inhibition under la toxicity at both temperatures . compared with a slight growth inhibition was also detected in la at . these results indicate that the gene was partially related to a la resistance mechanism in yeast . while the mutant carrying the gene showed a similar la sensitivity to the mutant carrying . this result indicated that the gene could not complement the mutation for la toxicity in yeast . arabidopsis transgenic plants over _PROTEIN_ the gene showed a similar sensitivity to ler in la toxicity consistent with the results shown in yeast transformants .
