the water and nutrient status of pollen is crucial to plant reproduction . pollen grains of arabidopsis contain a large vegetative cell and two smaller sperm cells . pollen grains _PROTEIN_ and two members of the tonoplast intrinsic protein subfamily of aquaporins . to address the spatial and temporal _PROTEIN_ pattern of the two homologs c terminal fusions of and with green _METHOD_ protein and mcherry respectively were _PROTEIN_ in transgenic arabidopsis under the control of their native promoter . confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that and are specific for the _LOCATION_ of the vegetative and sperm cells respectively . the tonoplast localization of was established by reference to _METHOD_ protein markers for the mitochondria and _LOCATION_ of sperm and vegetative cells and is at variance with the claim that is localized in vegetative cell mitochondria . green _METHOD_ protein and mcherry showed concomitant _PROTEIN_ from first pollen mitosis up to pollen tube penetration in the ovule thereby revealing the dynamics of _LOCATION_ morphology in maturating and germinating pollen . transfer dna insertion mutants for either or showed no apparent growth phenotype and had no significant defect in male transmission of the mutated alleles . by contrast a double knockout displayed an abnormal rate of barren siliques this phenotype being more pronounced under limited water or nutrient supply . the overall data indicate that _LOCATION_ of vegetative and sperm cells functionally interact and contribute to male fertility in adverse environmental conditions .
neutral red was used to visualize the _LOCATION_ equipment of mature and germinating arabidopsis pollen . under light transmission a multitude of _LOCATION_ of to in diameter was revealed throughout the whole vegetative cell . during pollen germination a bigger _LOCATION_ became visible distal to the _PROTEIN_ emergence side while smaller _LOCATION_ were present proximal to the emergence side . to possibly get a better resolution we also used confocal laser scanning microscopy . the z stack projection of a series of optical sections obtained in the vegetative cell showed a pattern and amount of stained structures similar to those observed under transmission light . small spherical vesicles were also _METHOD_ labeled in the sperm cells of mature pollen . these vesicles probably represent the sperm _LOCATION_ . c terminal fusions of and with _METHOD_ and mcherry respectively were placed under the control of their native promoter and introduced into transgenic arabidopsis and their _PROTEIN_ was imaged in pollen . the dna dye diamino phenylindole was used to define the different developmental stages . in accordance with transcriptomic data no or low _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ was observed in tetrads or released microspores . _PROTEIN_ became visible after first pollen mitosis exclusively in the vegetative cell of bicellular pollen grains and with early _PROTEIN_ in a perinuclear _PROTEIN_ . soon afterward _METHOD_ labeled fuzzy structures and a multitude of small dispatched vesicles similar to those visualized using neutral red . a mitochondria targeted red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ under the control of a vegetative cell specific _PROTEIN_ anther promoter _METHOD_ did not show any colocalization with _METHOD_ . by contrast the fuzzy structures were partially costained with _LOCATION_ tracker blue white dpx . thus these structures probably correspond to multiple compartments of the secretory system . because their labeling by _METHOD_ diminished over the course of pollen maturation and was almost totally lacking in germinating pollen grains this localization may reflect the anterograde trafficking of _METHOD_ to the _LOCATION_ . the _METHOD_ fusion also intensely labeled the vegetative cell during pollen germination and _PROTEIN_ emergence revealing the high degree of vacuolation associated with these processes . tubular _LOCATION_ and bulb like structures were also strongly highlighted by the fusion protein in the _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ of mcherry appeared at the binuclear pollen state simultaneously to that of _METHOD_ . by contrast mcherry showed _PROTEIN_ exclusively in the sperm cells . _PROTEIN_ first appeared as a perinuclear _PROTEIN_ surrounding the generative _LOCATION_ . the protein then accumulated in the _LOCATION_ of minute spherical structures . an observation of sperm cells released from mature pollen grains confirmed the sperm specific _PROTEIN_ of mcherry . each of the sperm cells examined disposed of one to six of these structures that typically ranged between and in size . because these structures were comparable to those seen with neutral red but could also correspond to mitochondria we assessed their nature using coexpression of mcherry with well identified subcellular markers . sc _METHOD_ a mitochondria targeted _METHOD_ fusion protein under the control of the sperm cell specific duo _PROTEIN_ promoter revealed intensely stained oblong structures of approximately in length . thorough observations in dry and hydrated pollen did not indicate however any colocalization of sc _METHOD_ with mcherry . vha one of three e soluble subunits of the _LOCATION_ h _PROTEIN_ is highly abundant in sperm cells . upon coexpression colocalization in both spherical and fuzzy structures was observed between mcherry and vha _METHOD_ which could be confirmed in three dimensional image reconstructions and in released sperm cells . a colocalization in sperm cells of mcherry with another soluble subunit of the _LOCATION_ h _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which localizes to both vegetative and sperm _LOCATION_ confirmed this finding . our overall data indicate that mcherry was localized to organelles of the secretory pathway including _LOCATION_ but not to the mitochondria of sperm cells . this pattern of labeling was sustained during pollen germination when the sperm cell migrated into the _PROTEIN_ . it could be followed up to the micropyle penetration of the _PROTEIN_ into the embryo sac . because an earlier study proposed that localizes to the mitochondria of the vegetative cell we wondered whether this protein may not show distinct subcellular localization depending on its cell _PROTEIN_ context . we therefore generated the construct _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ previously used for ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the vegetative cell and analyzed its coexpression with the vc _METHOD_ mitochondrial marker . the _PROTEIN_ fusion protein showed a fuzzy _PROTEIN_ across the whole vegetative cell with a more pronounced accumulation in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and small punctuate structures . yet no colocalization with the mitochondrial marker was observed in any of these locations . to further establish the _PROTEIN_ specificity of _METHOD_ and mcherry we analyzed the pollen of plants coexpressing the two fusion proteins . while _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ was exclusively found throughout the vegetative cell _PROTEIN_ of mcherry was restricted to the sperm cell . the overall data establish the _PROTEIN_ specificity of and in the _LOCATION_ of the vegetative and sperm cells respectively . transgenic arabidopsis lines carrying a t dna insertion in the promoter of and in the second intron of were used to produce homozygous knockout lines hereafter referred to as _PROTEIN_ and and lacking any transcript for and respectively . represents a knockout allele different from that described by citation . neither _PROTEIN_ nor showed any macroscopic shoot growth phenotype in accordance with the quasiexclusive _PROTEIN_ of these _PROTEIN_ in generative pollen tissues . although the loss of or might cause a defect in pollen maturation or pollen _LOCATION_ functions there was no major reduction in fertility in the mutant plants . to investigate slight alterations in male transmission of the mutated allele we carried out crosses in which pollen from heterozygous or plants were manually deposited on pistils from sister wild type plants . such crosses create a competition for male transmission between the mutated and the wild type alleles . a reciprocal cross in which pollen from the same wild type plant was deposited on stigma of the respective or plant was performed as a control . transmission of the mutated allele in the offspring seeds was screened using pcr or t dna encoded antibiotic resistance . pollen from heterozygous mutant plants was crossed onto stigma of wild type plants . in a control assay the reciprocal crosses were accomplished on the same plants . crosses were performed in six to seven plant pairs with at least six individual flowers per plant yielding more than seeds for each cross . the table shows the number of wild type and heterozygous plants and the percentage of heterozygous plants in the corresponding progenies . a test was applied comparing the transmission of the mutated allele to the theoretically expected percentage of transmission and in the case of a heterozygous male to the percentage of transmission observed in the reciprocal cross . values are in all cases below the given threshold value of . the plants used for the crossings were sister lines obtained in the progeny of self crossed heterozygous mutant plants . dashes indicate that data are not available . control crosses yielded and of and seeds . these values are slightly below but not significantly different from the theoretically expected value . in the reciprocal crosses the transmission efficiency of the _PROTEIN_ and mutant alleles was and respectively . these percentages were not significantly different from the respective control crosses or from the theoretically expected percentage . thus there was no significant defect in male transmission of either one of the _PROTEIN_ or alleles in agreement with the work by citation . a homozygous double knockout line _PROTEIN_ that lacks both and was prepared and characterized for pollen function and reproduction . vitality assay with alexander s stain did not reveal any abnormalities when comparing _PROTEIN_ with wild type pollen . wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants grown in soil at under regular irrigation had similar silique number . we noticed however that and of their siliques were shorter than fully developed siliques and mostly devoid of seeds . these siliques contained instead numerous nonfertilized ovules . with respect to wild type plants the proportion of barren siliques was significantly higher in _PROTEIN_ but not in _PROTEIN_ and plants . when grown in hydroponic nutrient replete conditions wild type and double knockout plants had virtually no barren siliques and comparable mean silique numbers _PROTEIN_ . when grown in hydroponic conditions but under nitrate deprivation plants showed a dramatically reduced number of siliques with more pronounced effects in _PROTEIN_ than in wild type plants . when plants were grown in soil but subjected to a severe heat treatment the number of siliques was reduced by fold in the wild type and approximately fold in _PROTEIN_ . altogether the data point to a defect of _PROTEIN_ plants to achieve proper seed development and silique growth that is a true reproduction phenotype . this phenotype was the most pronounced under environmental stress conditions .
all plants used in this work were arabidopsis accession columbia . the complementary dnas of enhanced green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and mcherry were pcr amplified with primers _METHOD_ allowing for
