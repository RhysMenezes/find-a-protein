in contrast with many other essential metals the _METHOD_ of mn acquisition in higher eukaryotes are seldom studied and poorly understood . we show here that arabidopsis thaliana relies on a high affinity uptake system to acquire mn from the soil in conditions of low mn availability and that this activity is catalyzed by the divalent metal transporter _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ loss of function mutant grows poorly contains less mn than the wild type and fails to take up mn in conditions of mn limitation thus demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ is the major high affinity mn transporter in arabidopsis . based on confocal microscopy observation of an _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein fusion we established that _PROTEIN_ is localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . consistent with its function in mn acquisition from the soil _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is restricted to the root and stimulated by mn deficiency . finally we show that _PROTEIN_ restores the capacity of the iron regulated mutant to take up iron and cobalt indicating that _PROTEIN_ has a broad selectivity in vivo . the role of transporters of the _PROTEIN_ family is well established in higher eukaryotes for iron but has been controversial for mn . this study demonstrates that _PROTEIN_ is a physiological manganese transporter in arabidopsis .
in a previous work we showed that transgenic arabidopsis lines overexpressing _PROTEIN_ are more tolerant to iron toxicity suggesting a role for _PROTEIN_ in iron homeostasis . to directly address the physiological function of _PROTEIN_ we characterized an arabidopsis t dna insertional mutant named _PROTEIN_ from the salk collection . in the _PROTEIN_ allele the t dna is inserted in the ninth exon of the _PROTEIN_ gene . the _PROTEIN_ transcript was not detectable in this line as shown by rt pcr indicating that _PROTEIN_ is a null allele of _PROTEIN_ . we found no apparent phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutant when grown in the presence of various concentrations of iron . since _PROTEIN_ is able to rescue the mn uptake defect of yeast strain we investigated _PROTEIN_ behavior in response to mn availability . when cultivated in vitro in a medium lacking mn _PROTEIN_ plants were paler produced fold less _METHOD_ and showed a root growth rate up to twofold lower than wild type plants . in the presence of an excess of mn in the medium however the observed growth inhibition was indistinguishable between wild type and mutant plants thus ruling out the possibility that knocking out _PROTEIN_ would increase the plant tolerance to mn toxicity . to test whether the poor growth of _PROTEIN_ in limited mn availability is a consequence of an alteration of the plant mn content we measured metal content by inductively coupled _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in shoots and roots of wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants cultivated in vitro in either mn replete or mn deficient medium during weeks . as expected we observed a drastic reduction in the concentration of mn in the shoots of _PROTEIN_ plants grown under mn deficiency . the concentration of mn in the roots however was not significantly _PROTEIN_ in the mutant . in mn replete conditions mn content was identical in shoots of wild type and mutant plants consistent with the lack of a macroscopic phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutant in these growth conditions . nevertheless roots of the mutant contained twofold less mn than wild type roots even though no growth defect was detected in these conditions . because iron was shown by heterologous _PROTEIN_ in yeast to be a substrate of _PROTEIN_ we tested whether fe content was also affected in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . _PROTEIN_ of the mn concentration in the medium fe content remained essentially unaffected by the mutation . likewise the amount of zn or cu was not modified in the mutant . cobalt concentration however _PROTEIN_ by both in roots of mn replete _PROTEIN_ plants and in shoots of mn deficient plants thus following the same trend as mn . altogether these results confirm that accumulation of mn and to a lesser extent accumulation of co is altered in the _PROTEIN_ mutant a result that is consistent with the growth defect observed under mn limited conditions . elemental analysis of shoots and roots of wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants to perform a complementation test the _PROTEIN_ line was transformed with a construct containing _PROTEIN_ fused to green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . production of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein in the _PROTEIN_ mutant was tested by immunoblot analysis on root proteins probed with anti _METHOD_ antibodies . among transgenic lines and that presented a strong _METHOD_ signal in immunoblot analysis line was grown hydroponically for weeks under mn replete or deficient conditions together with wild type and _PROTEIN_ untransformed mutant plants . in replete conditions no growth difference was observed between the plants . in the absence of added mn however the phenotypic defect of _PROTEIN_ was clearly rescued by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ as shown for complemented line in _METHOD_ of both shoot growth and root _METHOD_ production . furthermore _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ restored mn content in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . this result confirmed that _PROTEIN_ phenotypic disorders are caused by the loss of _PROTEIN_ . in addition to complementing _PROTEIN_ phenotype the overexpression of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ provoked a hypertolerance of the plants to mn deficiency as shown by the size of these plants and their mn content both of which exceeded that of wild type plants . the finding that plants containing more of the _PROTEIN_ transporter are more tolerant to mn deficiency is in good agreement with the loss of tolerance to mn deficiency of the _PROTEIN_ mutant and further argues in favor of the role of _PROTEIN_ in improving mn availability to plants in mn limiting conditions . the level of _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was determined by real time rt pcr in the root and shoot of plants grown for weeks in hydroponic culture . we found _PROTEIN_ transcripts to be times more abundant in roots than in shoots . in addition the level of transcripts increased fold when plants were grown in the absence of mn . we next analyzed the kinetics of response of _PROTEIN_ to mn deficiency and resupply . ten day old plants grown in vitro in mn replete conditions were transferred to mn deficient medium and _PROTEIN_ transcript abundance was measured over time by real time quantitative rt pcr . after an initial decline in _PROTEIN_ level _PROTEIN_ transcript abundance slowly increased after d of mn deficiency to reach its maximal level at d . upon resupply of mn to d old mn starved plants the abundance of _PROTEIN_ transcripts _PROTEIN_ down to the basal level of mn replete plants in to d . we concluded that _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ is regulated by mn availability and that the response is moderate and slow . to determine the pattern of _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the root we analyzed _PROTEIN_ promoter activity by assessing _PROTEIN_ activity histochemically in transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ the uida gene under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter . one representative line out of primary transformants analyzed is shown in figure . in mn replete conditions gus activity was weakly observed along the root whereas strong gus staining was observed in the elongation zone of the root when plants were grown under mn deficiency . a cross section in the region with the strongest staining revealed that all the cell layers are stained including the undifferentiated vascular tissue . as the root matures gus activity was found to fade away in all cell types except for a pronounced staining in the vascular cells and in root hairs . to identify the target _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ we followed the localization of the _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ lines producing _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ a fusion protein shown above to rescue the phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ observed by confocal microscopy in roots of d old plants labeled the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of all the cell layers consistent with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ being driven by the promoter . figure presents the _METHOD_ observed in a root hair cell which has the advantage of having well separated _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ that are therefore easy to distinguish . indeed the signal is observed on the _LOCATION_ surrounding the root hair cell which is clearly distinct from the tonoplast _LOCATION_ that delineates small _LOCATION_ visible in the bright field picture . we therefore concluded that the _PROTEIN_ protein is targeted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . both the tissue and _LOCATION_ localizations of _PROTEIN_ were compatible with a function of mn acquisition from the soil . to test this hypothesis we assayed mn uptake in wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant roots . plants were grown in hydroponic cultures for weeks in mn replete conditions and then transferred to a medium lacking mn for week to induce mn acquisition _METHOD_ . following mn resupply the kinetics of mn accumulation in roots were measured by atomic absorption _METHOD_ . we observed a strong _PROTEIN_ in mn accumulation capacity in _PROTEIN_ roots compared with wild type roots whose mn content was approximately fivefold greater min after mn addition . the level of mn was restored in the complemented mutant _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ is required for optimal accumulation of mn in the roots . concentration dependence of the mn uptake obtained in the first min indicated that in arabidopsis wild type plants mn uptake is composed of a saturable uptake system in the low range of mn concentrations and a linear uptake system in the higher range likely corresponding to high affinity and low affinity transport activities respectively . compared with the wild type mn uptake by _PROTEIN_ roots was completely lost at low mn concentrations whereas at higher concentration of mn the uptake by _PROTEIN_ paralleled that of the wild type . this indicates that the _PROTEIN_ mutant is defective in high affinity mn uptake from the root . the rate of _PROTEIN_ dependent uptake at low concentrations of mn was calculated by subtracting the mn taken up by _PROTEIN_ roots from that taken up by wild type roots . the data conformed to a michaelis menten function and when _PROTEIN_ as a double reciprocal lineweaver burk plot enabled us to calculate an apparent km and vmax of nm and min respectively . we therefore concluded that _PROTEIN_ catalyzes high affinity mn uptake in arabidopsis roots . based on complementation assays in yeast metal transport defective mutants _PROTEIN_ is likely a broad spectrum metal transporter including at least mn and fe among its substrates . several studies have shown that _PROTEIN_ is also upregulated by fe deficiency . however whether _PROTEIN_ is capable of transporting fe in vivo can not be tested easily due to the presence of functional _PROTEIN_ whose very strong fe uptake activity in conditions of fe limitation is likely to mask a defect of fe uptake in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . we therefore designed a complementation assay in which ha tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of the iron deficiency inducible root epidermis specific _PROTEIN_ promoter was transformed into the loss of function mutant _PROTEIN_ . this ha _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was shown to be functional based on the restoration of the growth defect of the _PROTEIN_ mutant in low mn . since absorption of fe zn mn and co is impaired in _PROTEIN_ in fe limited conditions this mutant was used as a plant test tube to investigate the selectivity of _PROTEIN_ in planta . immunoblot analysis using anti ha antibody as a probe confirmed the accumulation of ha _PROTEIN_ in roots specifically when grown under fe deficiency as shown here for two transgenic lines . as expected _PROTEIN_ plants developed poorly compared with wild type plants when grown on soil or in vitro in iron limited conditions . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ driven by the _PROTEIN_ promoter partially restored _PROTEIN_ growth suggesting that _PROTEIN_ can rather efficiently replace _PROTEIN_ when produced in _PROTEIN_ cell territories . we next investigated whether the _PROTEIN_ transgene could restore _PROTEIN_ metal content by analyzing elemental content in _PROTEIN_ complemented _PROTEIN_ plants . in this experiment d old plants were transferred to fe free and low mn medium to induce _PROTEIN_ promoter activity and provide nutritional mn conditions _PROTEIN_ for optimal transport activity of _PROTEIN_ . ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ led to on average greater root fe content compared with untransformed _PROTEIN_ . in such fe depleted conditions fe accumulation was as low in roots of wild type plants as in _PROTEIN_ . it is thus remarkable that transgenic _PROTEIN_ complemented _PROTEIN_ lines are more efficient at extracting fe from the soil than wild type plants . consistent with its function in mn uptake _PROTEIN_ restored mn level in the roots of _PROTEIN_ . similar to fe however the mn deficient growth condition prevented plants from accumulating large amounts of mn thus minimizing the difference of mn content both between the wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant and between _PROTEIN_ mutant and _PROTEIN_ complemented _PROTEIN_ lines . indeed when the same experiment was performed in the presence of a fold higher mn concentration in the culture medium mn entry into _PROTEIN_ complemented _PROTEIN_ lines increased up to threefold compared with _PROTEIN_ . cobalt and zinc are also substrates of _PROTEIN_ and are therefore drastically reduced in _PROTEIN_ roots . co content was corrected to up to by complementation with _PROTEIN_ . interestingly although _PROTEIN_ fails to complement the zn transport defective yeast mutant we measured a slight but statistically significant increase of zn content in _PROTEIN_ complemented _PROTEIN_ lines . this increase however restored < of the _PROTEIN_ zn accumulation defect . cu which is not transported by _PROTEIN_ is shown here as a negative control of the experiment . in addition measurement of metal content in shoots of these plants did not reveal significant differences probably owing to the initial d period of growth in conditions of metal sufficiency that efficiently rescues the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype . altogether these data reveal that in addition to mn _PROTEIN_ is capable of transporting fe co and to a lesser extent zn into the root .
