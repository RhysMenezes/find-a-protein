a hydrophilic protein _PROTEIN_ was found to be stably bound to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in arabidopsis thaliana . _PROTEIN_ was quantified to account for of the crude _LOCATION_ fractions from roots and shoots . its homologous protein was detected in several plant species . we investigated the mechanism of _LOCATION_ association of _PROTEIN_ by transient _PROTEIN_ of fusion protein with green _METHOD_ protein . the sequence of residues of _PROTEIN_ had a potential to localize the fusion protein with green _METHOD_ protein to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the substitution of gly at position with ala resulted in the cytoplasmic localization of _PROTEIN_ . when _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in the in vitro transcription/translation system with myristic acid the label was incorporated into _PROTEIN_ but not into a mutant _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ replaced by ala . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ tightly binds to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ via at _PROTEIN_ . we examined the binding capacity with phosphatidylinositol phosphates and found that _PROTEIN_ selectively interacts with phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylinositol . competition assay with the peptide and mutational analysis revealed that _PROTEIN_ interacts with these two ptdinsps at the part . interaction of _PROTEIN_ with the _LOCATION_ and ptdinsps was not altered in the presence of at physiological concentrations . furthermore calmodulin associated with _PROTEIN_ in a manner and its association weakened the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with ptdinsps . these results indicate that the part is essential for both and interaction with ptdinsps and that _PROTEIN_ may be involved in intracellular signalling through interaction with ptdinsps and calmodulin .
_PROTEIN_ is composed of amino acids and is rich in glu lys and val . the protein has characteristic repeats . to date no motif has been found for enzymatic function . a possible candidate for exists at the region as described _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ has many ser and thr residues and some residues have been estimated to be phosphorylation sites . a homologous protein with high identity with _PROTEIN_ was found in nicotiana tabacum by blast search . this protein was named _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . although the protein was detected in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and endomembrane fractions its physiological and biochemical properties are unknown . the halves are highly conserved between the two sequences suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and its orthologues are not unique to a. thaliana . the calculated molecular _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ is however the protein was detected with a molecular _METHOD_ of kda in an immunoblot with igg which was raised against the peptide with internal sequence of _PROTEIN_ . the difference between the calculated and apparent size may be caused by the amount of bound to _PROTEIN_ and/or the structure in _PROTEIN_ . immunoblotting showed bands in raphanus sativus brassica rapa brassica rapa var . glabra regel and brassica oleracea var . italica . the immunostained bands disappeared when the corresponding peptide was added to the reaction medium . thus these bands were orthologues of _PROTEIN_ . the low intensity of immunostaining except for a. thaliana may be caused by the partial difference in the sequence corresponding to the epitope . we did not examine the _LOCATION_ preparation from n. tabacum because the corresponding sequence is not a match with that of _PROTEIN_ . to determine the amount of _PROTEIN_ in tissues and the distribution of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ and soluble fractions we prepared the recombinant _PROTEIN_ as the standard protein . as shown in fig . a highly purified preparation of _PROTEIN_ without any tag was obtained . the protein was analysed by _PROTEIN_ and immunoblotting with an igg to obtain a calibration curve . the crude _LOCATION_ fractions and soluble fractions were prepared from shoots and roots and subjected to immunoblotting . the absolute amount of _PROTEIN_ was calculated using a standard curve . most _PROTEIN_ was recovered in the _LOCATION_ fractions and the _PROTEIN_ amounts in the shoot and root fractions were and of total _LOCATION_ protein respectively . there was only a trace amount of _PROTEIN_ in the soluble fractions . thus _PROTEIN_ was predominantly localized to the _LOCATION_ in the tissues and was present at and of total _LOCATION_ proteins in the shoots and roots respectively . the stability of the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was examined by treating the _LOCATION_ with several reagents . _PROTEIN_ was not released from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ by treatment with m nacl or m urea . even in m nacl _PROTEIN_ was stably associated with the _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ was partially released from the _LOCATION_ by treatment with m or triton . in general alkaline treatment with removes peripheral _LOCATION_ proteins which are associated with _LOCATION_ intrinsic proteins and a mild detergent triton is used to solubilize _LOCATION_ proteins but not all _LOCATION_ integral proteins . partial resistance to detergent and alkaline treatment indicates that _PROTEIN_ has properties similar to _LOCATION_ integral proteins . the stable association of a protein without transmembrane domains with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ led us to determine the mode of interaction . the results shown in fig . suggest that the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with the _LOCATION_ does not occur electrostatically or by association with transmembrane proteins . indeed we failed to isolate a complex of _PROTEIN_ with transmembrane protein . therefore we examined lipid modification especially as _PROTEIN_ contains a putative consensus sequence at the . if the protein is _PROTEIN_ will be the site of covalent modification . we prepared a _PROTEIN_ mutant construct whose _PROTEIN_ was replaced by ala linked with green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ at the of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . we then _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ fusion proteins in a. thaliana cells . we observed more than cells for each construct by confocal laser scanning microscopy . green _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ was clearly detected in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in contrast the _METHOD_ of the _PROTEIN_ mutant was observed in the _LOCATION_ but not in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . this was not caused by the release of the _METHOD_ moiety from the fusion protein by proteolytic cleavage in the cells because free _METHOD_ was always localized to the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . to examine whether the sequence included a possible myristoylation signal we prepared two additional _METHOD_ fusion proteins one with the first sequence of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the other with a modified sequence in which _PROTEIN_ was replaced by ala _PROTEIN_ . green _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ was detected in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ respectively . the results indicate that the part with residues has the ability to localize the protein to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and that _PROTEIN_ is essential for _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization . to confirm the of _PROTEIN_ we carried out an in vitro transcription/translation assay in the presence of myristic acid using rabbit reticulocyte lysate which contained activity . because occurs cotranslationally the experiments were carried out in a transcription/translation system . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a typical myristoylated protein was synthesized as a kda protein as detected by immunoblotting in this system and was labelled with myristic acid as shown by fluorography . _PROTEIN_ is myristoylated at _PROTEIN_ in the sequence and functions as an protein . when the gly residue was replaced by ala the mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ did not incorporate myristic acid . both _PROTEIN_ and its variant _PROTEIN_ were translated and detected as kda proteins by immunoblotting . radioactive myristic acid was incorporated into _PROTEIN_ but not into _PROTEIN_ . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is myristoylated at _PROTEIN_ . the part of _PROTEIN_ is rich in lys and aromatic residues . these characteristic sequences with clusters of basic/aromatic residues have been found in domains for interaction with ptdinsps . we determined the binding nature of _PROTEIN_ using _PROTEIN_ which were spotted with a series of ptdinsps . _PROTEIN_ bound to phosphatidylinositol ptdins ptdins and phosphatidylinositol and weakly with ptdins p ptdins p and ptdins p. the protein did not associate with lysophosphatidic acid lysophosphatidylcholine phosphatidylinositol phosphatidylethanolamine phosphatidylcholine sphingosine phosphatidic acid or phosphatidylserine . next we examined the effect of calcium on these properties because _PROTEIN_ has been demonstrated to bind calcium . the selectivity of binding was not changed by the addition of calcium to the reaction mixture at . potassium did not affect the intensity or selectivity even at mm but magnesium weakened the affinity but not the selectivity . further quantitative analysis was performed using a _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ bound ptdinsps in a manner . _PROTEIN_ had a high affinity for ptdins and ptdins and bound even at pmol on the sheet . the affinity for ptdins and ptdins was relatively low . we examined the binding selectivity of _PROTEIN_ using an array sheet containing ptdins ptdins and ptdins because there was a difference in the signal strength for the three between the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . this careful assay confirmed the high affinity of _PROTEIN_ for ptdins but not for ptdins or ptdins . the results indicated that _PROTEIN_ has an ability to bind selectively to ptdins and ptdins amongst the various ptdinsps . it should be noted that a tag did not affect the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with ptdinsps . at present we can not deny the weak interaction with ptdins and ptdins in this in vitro assay system . in general the polybasic residue region is a good candidate for binding to ptdinsps . the part is the most basic region containing seven lys residues . thus we carried out a competition assay of ptdinsp binding using a peptide that corresponds to the part . the purified _PROTEIN_ bound and ptdins . the binding intensity was _PROTEIN_ markedly in the presence of the _PROTEIN_ peptide suggesting that _PROTEIN_ binds ptdinsps at the region . this possibility was confirmed by comparison of the binding intensity to ptdinsps of the and truncated protein . the truncated form was slightly smaller than the _PROTEIN_ and highly purified as shown in fig . . this mutant protein gave no signal on either the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ has been demonstrated to bind calcium by the assay . thus we examined the effect of calcium on the association of _PROTEIN_ with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the purified _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ did not release _PROTEIN_ even in the presence of mm . thus calcium can not be an effector or regulator for dissociation/association of _PROTEIN_ from the _LOCATION_ . as shown in the _PROTEIN_ test calcium did not affect the interaction with ptdinsps . the selectivity to ptdinsps was unchanged and the interaction with ptdins and ptdins was retained up to . the affinity was _PROTEIN_ strongly in mm and lost at mm concentrations way above the physiological concentration . thus binding to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and ptdinsps may be stable in living cells at a physiological concentration of . there is no motif of enzymatic function in _PROTEIN_ . in order to understand the physiological role of a protein it is worth surveying the partner of the interaction protein . we examined the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with cam . when purified recombinant _PROTEIN_ was incubated with _PROTEIN_ bound to especially in the presence of and no _PROTEIN_ was recovered in the unbound fraction or wash fraction . this interaction was competitively inhibited by free cam in the incubation medium . the bound _PROTEIN_ was released and eluted by an _PROTEIN_ solution . when free calcium was removed from the incubation medium by egta no _PROTEIN_ was bound to agarose . the results indicate that _PROTEIN_ associates with cam in a manner . the _LOCATION_ association of _PROTEIN_ was not affected by cam even in the presence of . however cam suppressed the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with ptdinsps in the presence of the amount of _PROTEIN_ bound to ptdinsps was _PROTEIN_ to as shown by the intensity of the _PROTEIN_ signal in the _PROTEIN_ test . these results indicate that cam binds with _PROTEIN_ and affects the association of _PROTEIN_ with ptdinsps in a manner .
