the chloroplast is the site of photosynthesis and many other essential plant metabolic processes and chloroplast development is an integral part of plant growth and development . mutants defective in chloroplast development can display various color phenotypes including the intriguing virescence phenotype which shows yellow/white coloration at the leaf base and greening toward the leaf tip . through large scale genetic screens we identified a series of new virescent mutants including and in arabidopsis thaliana . we showed that encodes a putative chloroplast metalloprotease by map based cloning . through site directed mutagenesis we showed that the conserved histidine residue in the zinc binding motif heagh of is indispensable for accumulation in the chloroplast . the chloroplast localization of was confirmed by the transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ in leaf protoplasts . furthermore taking advantage of transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ we demonstrated that is an intrinsic _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein that _PROTEIN_ resides in the stromal lamellae . moreover topology analysis using transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ a dual epitope tagged indicated that both the n and c termini of are located in the stroma and the catalytic domain of is probably facing the stroma . blue native gel analysis indicated that is likely present as a monomer or part of a small complex in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . this work not only implicates as a new _PROTEIN_ involved in early chloroplast development but also provides more insight into the roles of chloroplast proteases in chloroplast biogenesis .
we have carried out large scale ethyl methanesulfonate _METHOD_ and activation tagging mutagenesis looking for genetic suppressors of the arabidopsis variegation mutant yellow variegated _PROTEIN_ . during the screening process we isolated a mutant that displayed both a leaf variegation phenotype typical of _PROTEIN_ and an additional virescent phenotype i.e . the bases of young leaves were yellow and leaf color gradually turned to green toward the leaf tips . following a previous naming system for virescent mutants we named this virescent mutation as . subsequently the _PROTEIN_ mutation in the original mutant was removed by backcrossing with wild type and further characterizations of were carried out in single mutant background . two additional virescent mutants and were recovered in an independent _METHOD_ mutagenesis . genetic analysis indicated that the three mutants are nonallelic and are results of _LOCATION_ recessive mutations . was characterized further in this study . to assess the photosynthesis activities in we measured the maximum quantum yield of psii of week old wild type and using a whole plant chlorophyll _METHOD_ imaging system . the average fv/fm value of wild type plants was whereas the fv/fm value of young yellow leaves was only . on the other hand the average fv/fm value of mature green tissues was . these results suggest that the quantum yield of psii photochemistry was impaired in young leaves but was gradually recovered as leaves turned green . next we compared the accumulations of individual photosynthetic proteins in wild type and . immunoblotting analyses were carried out using specific antibodies against subunits of key photosynthetic complexes in the chloroplast . we found that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lhcb _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ accumulated to wild type levels in the green tissues of but were reduced in the yellow tissues of leaves . in addition bn _PROTEIN_ analysis showed that major photosynthetic complexes such as the psii dimer the photosystem i monomer and the light harvesting complexes in accumulated to levels that are comparable with those of wild type . these observations suggest that chloroplast defects caused by closely correlated with mutant leaf developmental stages . to check the status of chloroplast development in the ultrastructures of _LOCATION_ in wild type green tissues and yellow tissues were examined with transmission electron microcopy . compared with wild type _LOCATION_ structures including grana and stromal lamellae were not grossly affected in the green or the yellow tissues of mutant . interestingly starch granules were reduced in both the green and yellow tissues of compared with those of the wild type . to validate the observations of electron microcopy we analyzed the starch accumulation in week old wild type and using the iodine staining method . the characteristic purple color of starch stained by iodine solution was observed in wild type but not in confirming the starch accumulation defects in . taken together these data indicate that although the chloroplasts in display seemingly normal ultrastructures their photosynthetic capacities are probably dampened . to identify the mutation in a mapping population was generated by crossing with ler . bulked segregant analysis first linked the mutation to two sslp markers and _PROTEIN_ on chromosome . further fine mapping with additional molecular markers narrowed down the chromosomal region containing the mutation to an interval of kb . based on the virescent phenotype we reasoned that likely encodes a chloroplast protein . genomic regions of three genes encoding putative chloroplast proteins located in the interval were sequenced . a single g to a transition was identified at the position from _PROTEIN_ in _GENE_ in . this mutation converts a tryptophan codon _PROTEIN_ to a stop codon . furthermore the overexpression of a wild type version of _GENE_ cdna in background fully complemented the virescent phenotype of . northern blot analysis confirmed that _GENE_ transcripts were greatly reduced in and dramatically increased in one complementation line . taken together these data indicate that _GENE_ is . is annotated to encode a protein of amino acids with unknown function in the arabidopsis information resource . however conserved domains/motifs searches revealed that may contain two transmembrane domains and is likely a member of the metalloprotease superfamily . the signature zinc binding motif hexxh for this type of metalloprotease is found near the c terminus of . a prominent example of the chloroplast _LOCATION_ localized type of metalloprotease in higher plants is _PROTEIN_ . in contrast to _PROTEIN_ lacks the _PROTEIN_ binding domain . next we obtained sequences of and like proteins from the national center for biotechnology information and analyzed their evolutionary relationship and putative subcellular localizations . database searches showed that like proteins are present in photosynthetic prokaryotic and eukaryotic _METHOD_ . most like proteins in higher plant species were predicted to be targeted to the chloroplast or the _LOCATION_ . phylogenetic analysis of like proteins from representative photosynthetic species showed that like proteins evolved into three distinct clades . each clade has one or like homolog belonging to representative dicot and monocot plant species . comparison of the gene structures of and like genes revealed that the number of exons and the length of each exon are highly conserved within each clade but are diversified between different clades . these analyses suggest that the three lineages of like proteins were diverged before the separation of monocots and dicots . at least two other like proteins _GENE_ and _GENE_ are present in arabidopsis . like _GENE_ is a putative chloroplast localized protein whereas _GENE_ is predicted to be targeted to the _LOCATION_ . to test whether there is functional redundancy between and _GENE_ we overexpressed _GENE_ in the mutant . as shown in fig . multiple overexpression lines showed greatly reduced virescence and greener leaves compared with that of . these observations suggest that the overexpression of the close homolog of _GENE_ could compensate for the loss of gene at least partially . to test whether the putative zinc binding motif is necessary for functions was replaced by a leucine residue via site directed mutagenesis and a _PROTEIN_ tag was added to the c terminus of this mutated form of to generate _PROTEIN_ . as a control a _PROTEIN_ tag was also added to a wild type form of _PROTEIN_ . these two constructs were transformed into the mutant respectively . independent _PROTEIN_ lines showed green true leaves and accumulated _PROTEIN_ protein suggesting that the c terminal _PROTEIN_ tag does not interfere with functions and _PROTEIN_ tagged is functional in plants . in contrast _PROTEIN_ lines showed leaf virescence similar to that of . in addition the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ protein was nondetectable despite the dramatically increased _PROTEIN_ transcripts in these lines . these results indicate that the putative zinc binding site of is indispensable for its function and/or stability . to confirm the chloroplast localization of n terminal region or the full length was fused with _METHOD_ and transiently _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis leaf protoplasts . although the _PROTEIN_ of the control vector _METHOD_ leads to a distribution of _METHOD_ signals in the cytoplasm and the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ signals overlapped nicely with the chlorophyll _METHOD_ suggesting that can direct _METHOD_ into chloroplasts . next we fused _METHOD_ at the c terminus of the full length protein and _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ fusion protein in leaf protoplasts . _METHOD_ appeared as discrete foci . merged images of _METHOD_ and chlorophyll _METHOD_ showed that all _METHOD_ signals located inside chloroplasts . to test whether could also be targeted to the _LOCATION_ we _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in protoplasts isolated from transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ mcherry a red _METHOD_ protein tagged _LOCATION_ marker . as shown in fig . no overlapped signals of _METHOD_ and mcherry were observed indicating that _METHOD_ is likely not targeted to the _LOCATION_ . taken together our results indicate that is a chloroplast protein . we next investigated the subchloroplast localization of . intact chloroplasts from _PROTEIN_ complementation lines were isolated and separated into the soluble stroma fraction and the _LOCATION_ fraction . as expected _PROTEIN_ was detected largely in the soluble stroma fraction whereas psii light harvesting complex lhcb was present in the _LOCATION_ fraction . immunoblotting with _PROTEIN_ antibody showed the presence of _PROTEIN_ signals in the intact chloroplasts and the _LOCATION_ fraction but not in the stroma fraction similar to lhcb signals . these results suggest that is associated with chloroplast _LOCATION_ . to distinguish whether resides in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or in the chloroplast envelope intact chloroplasts were further fractionated into _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and stroma fractions via sucrose gradient centrifugation . as expected _PROTEIN_ was only detected in the stroma fraction . lhcb was detected largely in the _LOCATION_ fraction . _PROTEIN_ a subunit of the chloroplast translocon at the chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ were enriched in the fraction . _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ detected in the _LOCATION_ fraction and trace amounts of _PROTEIN_ could also be detected in the fraction a pattern of signals similar to that of lhcb . in contrast neither in the stroma fraction nor in the fraction could _PROTEIN_ be detected . these results suggest that is likely a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein . to further confirm whether is an integral _LOCATION_ protein _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ lines were incubated with different salt solutions . _LOCATION_ associated proteins such as _PROTEIN_ can be effectively removed from the _LOCATION_ by chaotropic salts or the alkaline ph . in contrast intrinsic _LOCATION_ proteins such as lhcb remained in the _LOCATION_ after the treatments . _PROTEIN_ was retained in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fractions after the washes similar to lhcb . these data indicate that is an intrinsic _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein . to check whether is localized to specific regions of _LOCATION_ digitonin treated _LOCATION_ were separated by ultracentrifugation into different fractions enriched in grana _LOCATION_ or stromal lamellae . fig . showed that the psii reaction center protein _PROTEIN_ was enriched in grana _LOCATION_ as reported . on the other hand the psi reaction center protein _PROTEIN_ and the chloroplast _PROTEIN_ synthase subunit _PROTEIN_ were enriched in the stromal lamellae . _PROTEIN_ was enriched in the stromal lamellae resembling the patterns of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ suggesting that the majority of localizes to the stromal lamellae . contains two predicted transmembrane domains and an additional hydrophobic region harboring the peptidase domain . to determine the _LOCATION_ topology of a construct _PROTEIN_ a modified version of with a n terminal ha tag and a c terminal _PROTEIN_ tag was generated _PROTEIN_ and introduced into the mutant . accumulation of ha _PROTEIN_ proteins was detected in multiple transgenic lines . moreover the virescent phenotype of was fully complemented by the transgene indicating that the dual epitope tagged ha _PROTEIN_ is functional . _LOCATION_ of ctp ha _PROTEIN_ lines were treated with trypsin treated or mock treated with buffer . both the n terminal ha and the c terminal _PROTEIN_ signals became undetectable after trypsin treatment indicating that trypsin is able to access and degrade both epitopes . to verify the trypsin treatment results we also monitored the degradation of _PROTEIN_ a known stroma exposed _LOCATION_ protein using an antibody raised against the c terminal stromal region of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . as shown in fig . the changes in _PROTEIN_ signals were similar to those of ha and _PROTEIN_ thus confirming that the ha and _PROTEIN_ tags were exposed to the stroma . on the contrary psbp a _LOCATION_ lumen protein was protected by the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and was not degraded . when the detergent n dodecyl d maltoside was added to solubilize _LOCATION_ psbp also became accessible to trypsin . meanwhile in samples containing mock treated _LOCATION_ levels of ha _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and psbp all remained stable over the time points we examined confirming that there are no endogenous proteolytic activities in our assays . together these results suggest that both the n and c termini of are facing the stroma . based on these findings a possible model of topology in the _LOCATION_ was proposed . in this model is an intrinsic _LOCATION_ protein with two transmembrane domains and and the proteolytic domain bearing the putative zinc binding motif is located in the stroma . to determine whether _METHOD_ protein complexes two dimensional bn _PROTEIN_ was performed with _LOCATION_ fractions isolated from _PROTEIN_ lines . bsa and casein were included as the internal molecular weight controls . migrations of photosynthetic complexes such as psi monomer light harvesting complex ii and cytochrome in the bn gel were monitored with antibodies against _PROTEIN_ lhcb and _PROTEIN_ respectively . _PROTEIN_ was detected at a position between bsa and casein in the second dimension bn _PROTEIN_ gel suggesting that functions as a monomer or _METHOD_ a small complex in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ .
