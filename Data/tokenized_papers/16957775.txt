plants use sophisticated strategies to balance responses to oxidative stress . programmed cell death including the hypersensitive response associated with successful pathogen recognition is one cellular response regulated by reactive oxygen in various cellular contexts . the arabidopsis basic leucine zipper _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ shuttles between the _LOCATION_ and the cytoplasm and binds consensus and dna sequences . surprisingly _PROTEIN_ can be retained outside the _LOCATION_ by _PROTEIN_ a protein that protects arabidopsis cells from death in the face of oxidative stress signals . we demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is a positive mediator of the uncontrolled cell death observed in _PROTEIN_ mutants . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ act antagonistically in both hr and basal defense responses . _PROTEIN_ likely functions as a cellular hub where its interaction with _PROTEIN_ and additional as yet unidentified proteins contributes significantly to plant oxidative stress responses .
four of the predicted arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ proteins define the group c clade most closely related to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . polypeptide sequence alignment of these arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ with revealed common _PROTEIN_ tf motifs a basic region an extended leucine zipper responsible for and heterodimerization bipartite _LOCATION_ localization sequences and four domains idiosyncratic for group c _PROTEIN_ . the group c arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ including _PROTEIN_ bind elements . we extended these findings to the related element . competition experiments with excess native or mutated or oligonucleotides revealed that the binding of both by _PROTEIN_ required intact acgt core sequences . we analyzed the intracellular distribution of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ in transiently transformed parsley and arabidopsis protoplasts . _METHOD_ was exclusively localized to the _LOCATION_ but _METHOD_ was observed in both the _LOCATION_ and the cytoplasm . irradiation of transformed protoplasts for h with white red or blue light did not induce any change in the intracellular distribution of _METHOD_ . we concluded that signal other than light control the _LOCATION_ access of _PROTEIN_ or that its distribution is uncontrolled . we anticipated that _PROTEIN_ might be shuttled between the cytoplasm and the _LOCATION_ . we transiently _PROTEIN_ either _METHOD_ an artificial shuttling control protein called _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ synthase _PROTEIN_ and a _LOCATION_ export signal citation or _METHOD_ in protoplasts treated with the _LOCATION_ export inhibitor leptomycin b . lmb limited _METHOD_ and the _METHOD_ protein to the _LOCATION_ but did not influence the localization of passively diffusing _METHOD_ . thus _PROTEIN_ is actively shuttled from the _LOCATION_ to the cytoplasm under these conditions . this conclusion is supported by our finding that _PROTEIN_ interacts with arabidopsis _LOCATION_ export _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the yeast system . the first amino acids of _PROTEIN_ are required for interaction with _PROTEIN_ suggesting that the nes is localized within this region . we propose that an active retention mechanism might interfere with _LOCATION_ import of _PROTEIN_ and hence control its distribution . to identify proteins that might retain _PROTEIN_ in the cytoplasm we extended the _LOCATION_ transportation trap _PROTEIN_ system for retention screening in yeast . yeast cells producing were transformed with an arabidopsis cdna _PROTEIN_ library . transformants were replica plated onto media without leucine . clones displaying reduced growth on this media should contain plasmids encoding a cytoplasmic retention _PROTEIN_ . from transformants one clone reproducibly reduced the growth of yeast on media lacking leucine . it encoded _PROTEIN_ a negative regulator of plant cell death . yeast _PROTEIN_ exhibited reduced growth in the presence of _PROTEIN_ but grew equally well on media . thus _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ with does not alter yeast viability . _PROTEIN_ did not alter the _LOCATION_ activity of or . we used the _PROTEIN_ system to define the yeast compartment where _PROTEIN_ exerts its function on _PROTEIN_ . yeast _PROTEIN_ on media selective for _LOCATION_ activity did not grow indicating that _PROTEIN_ is predominantly cytoplasmic in yeast interacts with _PROTEIN_ outside of the _LOCATION_ and retains it there . _PROTEIN_ interacted with _PROTEIN_ in yeast but not with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or . the second and third of _PROTEIN_ were required for this interaction yet neither of these alone nor the small domain between them was sufficient for it . the region of _PROTEIN_ was sufficient for interaction with _PROTEIN_ . this domain is the least conserved region among the class c _PROTEIN_ tfs potentially explaining why _PROTEIN_ is the only member of this clade that interacts with _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ nls sequences are near the amino terminus and overlap the basic domain yet it is the _PROTEIN_ that interacts with _PROTEIN_ . we tested whether _PROTEIN_ could interfere with _PROTEIN_ dna binding in vitro . recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins were purified on . incubation of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ before addition of labeled oligonucleotide reduced _PROTEIN_ dna binding . in contrast only very weak inhibition of dna binding was observed when _PROTEIN_ was mixed with the oligonucleotide before addition of _PROTEIN_ . addition of _PROTEIN_ to oligonucleotide did not block subsequent _PROTEIN_ dna binding . bsa could not substitute for _PROTEIN_ . thus interaction of _PROTEIN_ with the _PROTEIN_ can hinder the nls located within the basic domain . _PROTEIN_ is not able to actively remove _PROTEIN_ once the latter is bound to dna . _PROTEIN_ driven by its native promoter is soluble and complements an _PROTEIN_ null allele . we could not detect _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ from its native promoter reliably so we resorted to either conditional _PROTEIN_ or constitutive _PROTEIN_ from the viral promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus . in the latter case _PROTEIN_ complements an _PROTEIN_ null allele and accumulates to approximately lower levels than does _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ conditionally . we conditionally overexpressed _PROTEIN_ both in and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants and studied the localization of _PROTEIN_ after cell fractionation . in plants _PROTEIN_ is detectable both in the soluble and the fraction at and min after induction . in _PROTEIN_ plants _PROTEIN_ localized exclusively to the _LOCATION_ microsomal fraction indicating that _PROTEIN_ normally slows the accumulation of newly synthesized _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ . weak constitutive overexpression of _PROTEIN_ leads to its accumulation in both soluble and fractions . based on the results in fig ref we reasoned that conditional overexpression of _PROTEIN_ in this context would increase the relative amount of _PROTEIN_ in the soluble fraction if their interaction was part of the control of _PROTEIN_ localization . fig ref demonstrates that this was the case despite a reproducible and modest increase in total _PROTEIN_ levels over this time course . to provide a third independent confirmation that _PROTEIN_ can retain _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ we analyzed the intracellular distribution of constitutively overexpressed _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the presence or absence of untagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts . in the absence of _PROTEIN_ of transformed protoplasts exhibited mixed cytoplasmic/nuclear distribution of _METHOD_ whereas only of the cells exhibited only _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ accumulation . in contrast when the _PROTEIN_ construct was cotransformed of the cells displayed exclusive accumulation of _METHOD_ in the cytoplasm . coexpression with _PROTEIN_ did not alter the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ . these data indicate that native _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ are sufficient to retain a significant amount of _PROTEIN_ in the cytoplasm . retention of _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ implies a direct interaction between these two proteins . we used bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation to demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ can interact in plant cells . _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ or fragments _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ and transiently overexpressed in tobacco epidermal leaf cells yielded strong _METHOD_ _METHOD_ either exclusively in the _LOCATION_ or in both the cytoplasm and the _LOCATION_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ can form homodimers under these conditions . transient overexpression of _METHOD_ fusions showed that homodimeric _PROTEIN_ accumulated in both the cytoplasm and the _LOCATION_ in of cells . of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ reduced significantly the fraction of cells _PROTEIN_ exclusively _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ whereas the fraction of cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in both compartments increased significantly . no bifc signals were detected when _METHOD_ was coexpressed with _METHOD_ indicating that the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ was specific . although we do not know whether the bifc constructs used are functional and although the _PROTEIN_ subcellular fractionation is altered by overexpression these results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ can interact in plant cells . we identified a insertion into _PROTEIN_ in . we constructed a conditional overexpression _PROTEIN_ allele using an promoter system in addition to the constitutive overexpression allele described above . transgenics were generated in both and the _PROTEIN_ allele . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ from the system accumulates to higher levels than from the constitutive promoter . to define genetic interactions between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we generated the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants were sprayed with benzo acid ester a salicylic acid analog that induces runaway cell death in _PROTEIN_ but does not induce cell death in . we measured ion leakage of these samples over time a readout correlated with plant cell death . _PROTEIN_ samples exhibited increased ion leakage reaching conductivity at h post application whereas and _PROTEIN_ samples displayed only a very slight increase in conductivity . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant displayed significant reduction of ion leakage compared to _PROTEIN_ . conversely weak overexpression of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ enhanced dramatically ion leakage a phenotype so pronounced that we needed to measure conductivity at earlier time points compared to _PROTEIN_ . conductivity in _PROTEIN_ reached by hpa . control and samples showed little increase in conductivity . we also demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ function is required for _PROTEIN_ rcd indicating that _PROTEIN_ is a positive regulator of rcd in _PROTEIN_ and not merely a mediator of bth response . hyaloperonospora parasitica is an obligate biotrophic oomycete parasite well suited for characterization of disease resistance responses . different rpp disease resistance genes control the recognition of different hp isolates . their action leads to hypersensitive cell death and cessation of pathogen growth . for weak rpp genes the degree of hr correlates with hp hyphal growth . in susceptible plants virulent hp isolates grow and cause downy mildew despite a plant basal defense response . we investigated whether _PROTEIN_ has a function in either hr or basal defense . we included the transgenic line described above and we generated a similar line for conditional overexpression of _PROTEIN_ . we probed function by infecting seedlings with hp . sites of host cell death and hp structures were stained with trypan blue at dpi . we evaluated microscopically the interaction sites and classified them as described in fig ref . a reduction in the percentage of hr sites and corresponding increases in trailing necrosis or free hyphae _PROTEIN_ interaction sites reflects _PROTEIN_ function . the control genotypes including uniformly exhibited a high percentage of tn interactions typical of the weak phenotype . _PROTEIN_ was completely resistant . we observed reproducible and significant _PROTEIN_ in function in _PROTEIN_ . by contrast resistance was significantly enhanced in both compared to and in compared to either untreated controls or treated with estradiol . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant was completely resistant like _PROTEIN_ . we conclude that loss of _PROTEIN_ function suppressed disease resistance whereas _PROTEIN_ overexpression enhanced it and loss of _PROTEIN_ enhanced disease resistance whereas _PROTEIN_ overexpression only marginally suppressed it . thus antagonistic functions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ modulate disease resistance response presumably via their antagonistic control of host cell death . it is likely that _PROTEIN_ regulates other proteins in addition to _PROTEIN_ as the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ exhibits the _PROTEIN_ phenotype . to assay basal defense seedlings were inoculated with hp . at dpi we counted sporangiophores per cotyledon . approximately of the cotyledons in each control genotype exhibited heavy sporulation . the lack of variation across these control genotypes confirmed that this assay was sensitive and robust . sporulation was drastically reduced in _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ mutant displayed a significant increase in susceptibility . by contrast both constitutive and conditional overexpression of _PROTEIN_ led to significantly _PROTEIN_ susceptibility compared to appropriate controls . finally although both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ exhibited _PROTEIN_ sporulation compared to _PROTEIN_ was significantly more resistant than _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ functions as a positive regulator of basal defense we predicted that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background should result in added resistance to hp . indeed of _PROTEIN_ cotyledons treated with estradiol did not support hp sporulation at dpi whereas only of _PROTEIN_ exhibited this phenotype . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ did not lead to increased cell death following hp infection and there is no increase in cell death in hp _PROTEIN_ . thus enhanced resistance to hp is due to enhanced basal defense that is apparently independent of cell death . we conclude that _PROTEIN_ is a positive regulator of basal defense as its loss resulted in increased hp sporulation and its overexpression resulted in the opposite phenotype _PROTEIN_ is a negative regulator of basal defense as its loss led to _PROTEIN_ hp sporulation _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ act antagonistically in this process and _PROTEIN_ may regulate additional unidentified positive mediators of basal defense . we infer this because _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ although significantly less resistant than _PROTEIN_ still more closely resembles _PROTEIN_ than _PROTEIN_ .
