proteins are a family of type i _LOCATION_ proteins localized to compartments of the early secretory pathway and to coat protein i _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ coated vesicles . they can be classified by sequence homology into four subfamilies named and . in contrast to animals and fungi plants contain only members of the and subfamilies . it has previously been shown that transiently _PROTEIN_ red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ localizes to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as a consequence of highly efficient _PROTEIN_ based recycling from the _LOCATION_ apparatus . using specific antibodies endogenous has now been localized to the _LOCATION_ and to the _LOCATION_ apparatus in arabidopsis root tip cells by immunogold electron microscopy . the relative contributions of the _LOCATION_ tail and the luminal domains to trafficking have also been characterized . it is demonstrated that whereas the dilysine motif in the cytoplasmic tail determines the location of in the early secretory pathway the luminal domain may contribute to its distribution downstream of the _LOCATION_ apparatus . by using knock out mutants and co immunoprecipitation experiments it is shown that and interact with each other . finally it is shown that and exhibit coupled trafficking at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ interface . it is proposed that and interact with each other at _LOCATION_ export sites for _LOCATION_ exit and coupled transport to the _LOCATION_ apparatus . once in the _LOCATION_ interacts very efficiently with the _PROTEIN_ machinery for retrograde transport back to the _LOCATION_ .
in order to localize endogenous proteins in arabidopsis peptide antibodies against two different members of the family were generated . since previous work was undertaken with this protein was chosen as one representative of the delta subfamily for antibody generation . moreover it has relatively high levels of _PROTEIN_ in different tissues according to gene _PROTEIN_ data of public microarray repertoires . antibodies were produced using peptides corresponding to both the n and the c terminus of . in contrast to the n terminus the c terminus of arabidopsis proteins is very similar among different members of the delta subfamily . in particular the c termini of and share residues with the c terminus of while sequence homology is lower in other members of the subfamily . therefore c terminal antibodies may also recognize and . according to public microarray databases has _PROTEIN_ levels comparable with those of while _PROTEIN_ is very low and tissue specific . antibodies against both the n and the c terminus of a protein of the beta subfamily were also generated . proteins were extracted from _LOCATION_ of arabidopsis cell suspension cultures or from arabidopsis roots . as shown in antibodies against the n terminus of recognized a protein of the expected molecular weight in _LOCATION_ from cell suspension cultures as well as in _LOCATION_ from roots . in the case of c terminal antibodies a major band of kda was obtained in _LOCATION_ from cell suspension cultures although a double band was detected in root _LOCATION_ . to characterize the specificity of the antibodies further available t dna insertion mutants for and were used . both mutants were found to be knock out mutants . in addition the double mutant was obtained . plants from the three lines resembled wild type plants under standard growth conditions either on vertical agar plates or on soil . western blot analysis with the nt antibody showed that was absent in root _LOCATION_ from the mutant or from the double mutant as expected for a knock out mutant but was present in the mutant . these mutants were next analysed with the ct antibody which detected two bands in extracts from wild type root _LOCATION_ . the upper band should correspond specifically to as it was absent in root _LOCATION_ from the mutant or from the double mutant confirming the results obtained with the n terminal antibody but was present in the mutant . in contrast the lower band was still present in the mutant but was almost undetectable in the double mutant . this suggests that the lower band detected by the ct antibody corresponds to a large extent to and that the ct antibody does not recognize any other abundant member of the delta subfamily in arabidopsis roots . finally antibodies against both the n and the c terminus of recognized a protein with an apparent molecular weight of kda . characterization of antibodies . characterization of antibodies against arabidopsis proteins . protein extracts were obtained from _LOCATION_ of arabidopsis cell suspension cultures or arabidopsis roots as described in the materials and methods and analysed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and western blotting with affinity purified antibodies against the n terminus c terminus n terminus and c terminus or with the corresponding pre immune sera . western blot analysis of _LOCATION_ from wild type or knock out mutants using antibodies against the nt or the ct of . a aliquot of protein was loaded in each lane . western blot with an antibody against the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ was used as a loading control . these antibodies were used to localize endogenous proteins by immunogold labelling on sections cut from cryofixed arabidopsis roots . as shown in the n terminal antibody produced a prominent labelling on _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . occasionally some labelling was also seen on the cis _LOCATION_ or on putative _PROTEIN_ vesicles _PROTEIN_ . in contrast the n terminal antibody showed significantly higher labelling at the _LOCATION_ apparatus although some labelling could also be seen at _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . the c terminal antibody was also used to localize endogenous proteins in and knock out mutants . as stated above the ct antibody should recognize and . in both mutant lines labelling was again found at _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but also a significant labelling at the cis side of the _LOCATION_ apparatus . the labelling obtained with the ct antibody in both mutant lines was very similar to that observed in wild type arabidopsis roots suggesting that the localization of endogenous or is not significantly affected by the absence of or respectively . immunogold labelling in wild type arabidopsis root cells number of micrographs analysed . number of micrographs analysed . localization of and by immunogold labelling on cryofixed arabidopsis roots . labelling with antibodies against nt at the _LOCATION_ and at a putative _PROTEIN_ vesicle .

_METHOD_ shows a uniform signal distribution throughout the _LOCATION_ both in tobacco mesophyll and in arabidopsis protoplasts as well as in cells and in tobacco leaf epidermal cells . whether the dilysine motif at the cytoplasmic tail of is sufficient for _LOCATION_ localization and trafficking in the early secretory pathway or if the luminal gold and coiled coil domains could also play a role has now been investigated . to this end _METHOD_ deletion mutants lacking either the gold or the coiled coil domains were prepared . these constructs were used for transient _PROTEIN_ in tobacco mesophyll protoplasts since they represent a versatile well characterized and reproducible system for transient _PROTEIN_ . nevertheless the localization of the different constructs was also confirmed in arabidopsis protoplasts . as shown in both deletion mutants localized exclusively to the _LOCATION_ where they co localized extensively with the _LOCATION_ marker _METHOD_ hdel . this suggests that the steady state localization of _METHOD_ at the _LOCATION_ is not dependent on the gold or the coiled coil domains . a deletion mutant lacking both the gold and the coiled coil domains _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ also localized exclusively to the _LOCATION_ indicating that the dilysine motif in the _LOCATION_ tail constitutes the minimal requirement for the steady state localization of _METHOD_ to the _LOCATION_ . the same _LOCATION_ localization was obtained when these constructs were _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts . furthermore this _LOCATION_ localization was not a consequence of overexpression since all constructs localized to the _LOCATION_ even at very low _PROTEIN_ levels . it was also tested whether gold or coiled coil domains were involved in anterograde _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ transport of _METHOD_ . to this end the three deletion mutants were co _PROTEIN_ with the _PROTEIN_ mutant in order to inhibit retrograde _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ transport . in this case _METHOD_ deletion mutants still localized to the _LOCATION_ but also to _LOCATION_ like punctae where they co localized with the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ as was the case for _METHOD_ . therefore the gold and coiled coil domains do not seem to have an influence on trafficking and localization of _METHOD_ in the early secretory pathway at least when _PROTEIN_ individually . _METHOD_ deletion mutants localize to the _LOCATION_ but cycle between the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ whilst mutants lacking the dilysine motif are transported to the pre _LOCATION_ compartment and the _LOCATION_ . transient gene _PROTEIN_ in tobacco mesophyll protoplasts . _METHOD_ deletion mutants lacking the coiled coil domain the gold domain or both show a typical _LOCATION_ pattern and co localize with the _LOCATION_ marker _METHOD_ hdel . _METHOD_ deletion mutants lacking the coiled coil domain the gold domain or both co localize partially with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in _LOCATION_ like punctae upon _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ . an _METHOD_ dilysine mutant lacking the gold domain _PROTEIN_ shows a prominent _LOCATION_ labelling but it also co localizes partially in punctae with _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or pvc _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ markers . an _METHOD_ dilysine mutant lacking the coiled coil domain _PROTEIN_ shows a weak _LOCATION_ labelling but it also co localizes partially in punctae with _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or pvc _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ markers . an _METHOD_ dilysine mutant with the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic tail _PROTEIN_ co localizes partially with the _LOCATION_ marker _METHOD_ hdel and the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . scale bars . in mammals the luminal domain of proteins has been proposed to play a role in trafficking of to the cell surface . it was previously found that _METHOD_ mutants lacking the dilysine motif were no longer present at the _LOCATION_ but were transported downstream to the pre _LOCATION_ compartment and the _LOCATION_ . therefore it was decided to investigate whether the gold and/or the coiled coil domains could play a role in _METHOD_ trafficking in the absence of the dilysine motif . to this end _METHOD_ deletion mutants with a mutated dilysine motif _PROTEIN_ lacking either the gold or the coiled coil domains were prepared . as shown in none of these mutants was found at the _LOCATION_ . in contrast they localized to the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the pvc _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and the _LOCATION_ lumen . the dilysine mutant lacking the gold domain had a more prominent _LOCATION_ labelling than the dilysine mutant lacking the coiled coil domain . this suggests that the coiled coil domain facilitates transport of dilysine mutants to the _LOCATION_ . to quantify the contribution of the coiled coil domain and to investigate whether transport of dilysine mutants to the _LOCATION_ correlated with their degradation the levels of the different constructs were analysed by western blotting with an _METHOD_ antibody . as shown in when compared with those of _METHOD_ the levels of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were very low although the same amounts of dna were used for transient _PROTEIN_ . these data suggest that once synthesized _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is degraded probably as a consequence of its transport to the _LOCATION_ as had been previously proposed . in contrast the levels of the dilysine mutant lacking the coiled coil domain _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were significantly higher suggesting that a reduced transport to the _LOCATION_ may correlate with a reduced degradation . biochemical quantitation of the _PROTEIN_ of the different constructs . tobacco mesophyll protoplasts were electroporated in the absence or the presence of of plasmid dnas corresponding to _METHOD_ and/or _METHOD_ . at h post electroporation protoplasts were washed extracted in laemmli sample buffer and analysed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and western blot analysis with antibodies against _METHOD_ or the c terminus . note the lower molecular weight of the _METHOD_ constructs lacking the coiled coil domain . a aliquot of protein was loaded for each of the extracts . finally a dilysine mutant lacking both the gold and the coiled coil domains _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was used . as shown in this was the only dilysine mutant which was partially localized to the _LOCATION_ showing a partial co localization with the _LOCATION_ marker _METHOD_ hdel . it also showed co localization with the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and eventually with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ but was rarely seen in the _LOCATION_ lumen . altogether it _METHOD_ that the absence of the luminal domain impairs trafficking from the _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ and downstream to the pvc and the _LOCATION_ . the lower _LOCATION_ labelling obtained in the dilysine mutant lacking the coiled coil domain suggests that this domain is important in trafficking beyond the _LOCATION_ apparatus . the localization and trafficking properties of a member of the beta subfamily have also been investigated . to this end a fusion construct similar to the one used to investigate in vivo trafficking and localization of _METHOD_ but with _METHOD_ instead of _METHOD_ was prepared . surprisingly the _METHOD_ signal obtained upon _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ appeared to be very low . however _METHOD_ was not present at the _LOCATION_ in contrast to _METHOD_ but showed a punctate pattern and it co localized partially with the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in both tobacco mesophyll and arabidopsis protoplasts but not with the pvc marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . localization of _METHOD_ . transient gene _PROTEIN_ in tobacco mesophyll protoplasts . _METHOD_ co localizes partially with the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in punctate structures . _METHOD_ punctae do not co localize with the pvc marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . transient gene _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts . _METHOD_ co localizes partially with the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in punctate structures . arrowheads point to co localizing signals . scale bars . interestingly when co _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ the signal of _METHOD_ was clearly more intense and localized to punctae . in addition it was observed that _METHOD_ which showed its typical _LOCATION_ pattern also localized to the same punctae under these conditions . an increased ratio in the concentrations of _METHOD_ versus _METHOD_ induced a progressive change in the localization of _METHOD_ from its typical reticulate _LOCATION_ pattern to a mostly punctated one and increased co localization between both proteins . this suggests that _METHOD_ is able to interact with _METHOD_ and is transported with the latter out of the _LOCATION_ . this co localization was also observed when both proteins were _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts . _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ co localize in punctae via the coiled coil domain . transient gene _PROTEIN_ in tobacco mesophyll protoplasts . _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ co localize in punctate structures . _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ do not co localize . _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ show extensive co localization with kda vp _METHOD_ in punctate structures . arrowheads point to co localizing signals . scale bars . to test whether interacts with via coiled coil domains _METHOD_ was co _PROTEIN_ with a deletion mutant of _METHOD_ lacking the coiled coil domain . in this case almost no co localization was detected between both proteins . in addition the signal of _METHOD_ was weak as it happened in the absence of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ showed its typical _LOCATION_ pattern without punctae even in the presence of increasing concentrations of _METHOD_ . this suggests that both proteins interact with each other via their coiled coil domain and that this interaction stabilizes overexpressed _METHOD_ . to quantify whether the protein levels of _METHOD_ were indeed dependent on the interaction with _METHOD_ protoplasts _PROTEIN_ these proteins were analysed by western blotting with ct or _METHOD_ antibodies . as shown in _METHOD_ was almost undetectable when _PROTEIN_ alone but its levels increased enormously upon co _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ but not with _METHOD_ . on the other hand the protein levels of _METHOD_ seem to be independent of the presence of _METHOD_ . in order to narrow down the identity of the compartment where _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ co localize _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were co _PROTEIN_ with kda vp _METHOD_ _METHOD_ a putative _PROTEIN_ marker . as shown in a high degree of co localization was observed between the three proteins in punctate structures suggesting that a fraction of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ is present in _PROTEIN_ labelled structures . whether the observed co localization/interaction between _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ correlated with their trafficking was next investigated . to this end both proteins were co _PROTEIN_ with the _PROTEIN_ mutant to interfere with retrograde _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ transport . this mutant _PROTEIN_ has been shown to redistribute _METHOD_ partially from the _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ like punctae . however when _METHOD_ was co _PROTEIN_ with the _PROTEIN_ mutant it showed a prominent _LOCATION_ labelling and did not co localize with mani _METHOD_ . this suggests that _METHOD_ localizes to the _LOCATION_ at steady state but may also cycle between the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . thus when retrograde _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ transport is blocked the protein is then transported by default to the _LOCATION_ . in contrast when both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were _PROTEIN_ together under the same conditions _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was not transported to the _LOCATION_ but co localized in punctae with _METHOD_ . this suggests that _METHOD_ holds back _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ interface . since both proteins co localize in punctate structures it was speculated that some of these punctae may correspond to _LOCATION_ stacks . to check this protoplasts were treated with brefeldin a . after h treatment a fraction of both proteins had redistributed to the _LOCATION_ as is the case for standard _LOCATION_ marker proteins for example mani _METHOD_ which relocate to the _LOCATION_ under these conditions . in contrast many of the punctate structures were bfa resistant and could represent the fraction of both proteins present in _PROTEIN_ labelled structures . however it was possible to observe a redistribution of both proteins to the _LOCATION_ after h of bfa treatment . altogether these experiments indicate that _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ traffic together at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ interface . coupled trafficking of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ interface . transient gene _PROTEIN_ in tobacco mesophyll protoplasts . _METHOD_ is transported to the _LOCATION_ upon co _PROTEIN_ with the _PROTEIN_ mutant and shows no co localization with the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ is not transported to the _LOCATION_ upon co _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ mutant in the presence of _METHOD_ but both proteins co localize in punctate structures . treatment with bfa after co _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ induces a partial relocalization of both proteins to the _LOCATION_ but many punctate structures still remain . scale bars . since the above experiments suggested an interaction between and it was decided to investigate this possibility further . previous studies where a single member of the family has been deleted or knocked down showed that the protein levels of other family members were reduced which probably reflects the _PROTEIN_ that those proteins interact with each other in hetero oligomeric complexes . therefore the protein levels of in a t dna mutant lacking were examined . to this end protein extracts were analysed with nt and ct antibodies . in both cases it was found that the levels of in the mutant were drastically reduced when compared with the wild type . these results indicate that the protein levels of are dependent on suggesting an interaction between these proteins . interaction between proteins . western blot analysis showing the levels of in _LOCATION_ from the wild type or the knock out mutant using antibodies against the nt or the ct of . a aliquot of protein was loaded in each

to test biochemically for a direct interaction between endogenous and co immunoprecipitation experiments were performed . to this end affinity purified antibodies were covalently bound to magnetic beads and were incubated in the presence of protein extracts from _LOCATION_ fractions as described in the materials and methods . proteins could be immunoprecipitated with the c terminal antibodies . under these conditions the corresponding proteins could be only immunoprecipitated with the c terminal antibodies . as shown in antibodies against the c terminus of immunoprecipitated as shown by western blot analysis with antibodies against the n terminus . more importantly immunoprecipitates containing also contained . the reverse was also true antibodies against the c terminus of immunoprecipitated and these immunoprecipitates also contained . these experiments again suggest that there is a direct interaction between and .
