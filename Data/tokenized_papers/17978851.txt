the arabidopsis thaliana genome contains more than genes encoding _PROTEIN_ domain proteins that are thought to be epigenetic regulators of gene _PROTEIN_ and chromatin structure . _PROTEIN_ domain proteins can be divided into subgroups and members of the polycomb group and trithorax group have been shown to be important regulators of development . both in animals and plants some of these proteins are components of multimeric protein complexes . here we have analyzed the arabidopsis trxg protein _PROTEIN_ which has a _PROTEIN_ domain and pre and post _PROTEIN_ domains similar to that of in drosophila . in addition to the _PROTEIN_ domain a divergent phd finger is found in the n terminus of the _PROTEIN_ protein . as expected from _PROTEIN_ domain proteins involved in transcriptional activation _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localizes to euchromatin . a yeast two hybrid screening revealed that the _PROTEIN_ protein interacts with the putative basic helix loop helix transcription _PROTEIN_ aborted microspores _METHOD_ which is involved in anther and stamen development in arabidopsis . deletion mapping indicated that both the phd finger and the _PROTEIN_ domain mediate the interaction between the two proteins . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ led in general to growth arrest and specifically to degenerated anthers and male sterility . _PROTEIN_ analyses demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ like _METHOD_ is _PROTEIN_ in the anther and in stamen filaments . we therefore propose that _METHOD_ can target _PROTEIN_ to chromatin and regulate genes involved in stamen development and function .
the _PROTEIN_ protein shows sequence similarity to known hmtases from the group of _PROTEIN_ domain proteins . the _PROTEIN_ protein encoded by _GENE_ has been classified as a member of the subgroup of trxg _PROTEIN_ domain proteins based on sequence similarity of the _PROTEIN_ domains and overall domain composition . to refine the classification of _PROTEIN_ blast searches were performed against the genbank nr database with the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domain sequence . alignment of the most similar sequences representing functionally characterized proteins demonstrated sequence similarity between these proteins and _PROTEIN_ not only in the catalytically important motifs of the _PROTEIN_ domain but also in the flanking aws _PROTEIN_ and post _PROTEIN_ domains . like many other trxg proteins the _PROTEIN_ protein also contains a putative phd finger . a prerequisite for a function in chromatin modulation is _LOCATION_ localization . to identify the subcellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein we analyzed transgenic plants containing a dex inducible _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion construct _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . root preparations from induced seedlings were inspected for subcellular _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ pattern and counterstained in dapi . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was exclusively localized in the _LOCATION_ . the fusion protein was excluded from the nucleolus and the bright dapi stained heterochromatin but associated with the less stained euchromatin in interphase _LOCATION_ . similarly when full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ in human hela cells it showed an exclusively _LOCATION_ localization and exclusion from the nucleoli . in the nucleoplasm the protein showed a combined granular and diffuse pattern . when comparing the _METHOD_ signal with the to pro signal _LOCATION_ it is evident that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is excluded from the perinuclear and perinucleolar regions which are rich in heterochromatin . together these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ is predominantly targeted to euchromatic chromatin . the homology with known lysine specific hmtases and the _LOCATION_ localization led us to investigate whether the _PROTEIN_ protein contained intrinsic hmtase activity in vitro . residues of _PROTEIN_ or full length _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ as _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins in e. coli and incubated with recombinant histones in an in vitro hmtase assay but no activity was detected . the lack of activity could be due to requirements of other histone tail modifications or that nucleosomes rather than free histones were the preferred substrate of _PROTEIN_ . therefore the activity was tested in the in vitro hmtase assay on core histones isolated from calf thymus and on mononucleosomes reconstituted from recombinant histones . several different assay conditions and incubation times were also tested . while the _PROTEIN_ protein included as a positive control as expected showed methyltransferase activity towards the recombinant _PROTEIN_ proteins showed no activity on these substrates even after four days exposure . to identify _PROTEIN_ interacting proteins a yeast two hybrid screen was performed using the full length _PROTEIN_ protein as a bait . five independent _PROTEIN_ interacting prey clones were isolated from diploid colonies able to grow on stringent medium selective for protein protein interactions . one clone encoded a _PROTEIN_ terminal part of aborted microspores _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ downstream of the annotated bhlh domain . the specificity of the interaction was tested by mating _METHOD_ with cells containing either empty vector lamin or _PROTEIN_ . only _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ diploid yeast cells could grow on qdo medium . the interaction was confirmed in a _PROTEIN_ pull down assay which showed that bacterially _PROTEIN_ full length _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ alone was able to pull down i.e . interact with in vitro translated radiolabelled full length _METHOD_ . the c terminal fragment of _METHOD_ picked up in the screen was also efficiently pulled down by _PROTEIN_ suggesting that the c terminus is sufficient for _METHOD_ interaction with _PROTEIN_ . to identify the part of _PROTEIN_ responsible for the interaction with _METHOD_ eight partly overlapping deletion constructs of _PROTEIN_ were introduced into the yeast bait vector . these fragments were tested in the assay against the c terminal fragment of _METHOD_ . initally _PROTEIN_ was divided in two fragments which both interacted . these were further divided and as shown in fig . a fragment constituting the phd finger and a fragment containing the _PROTEIN_ domain without the aws and post _PROTEIN_ domains both tested positive in the assay . this deletion mapping suggests that _METHOD_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ at two points the phd finger and the _PROTEIN_ domain . in the dilution series of diploid cells containing the different constructs growth was seen for the phd finger fragment at a dilution and for the _PROTEIN_ domain at the dilution suggesting that the interaction between the phd finger and _METHOD_ is stronger than _METHOD_ s interaction with the _PROTEIN_ domain . _METHOD_ is exclusively _PROTEIN_ in anthers and it was therefore of interest to identify the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ . as a first approach we performed a real time quantitative pcr analysis with _PROTEIN_ specific primers using cdna from different tissues . the highest transcript levels were found in flowers and buds . in all other tissues tested however only weak _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was detected . to investigate the spatial and temporal _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ in more detail four independent arabidopsis lines carrying single copies of a construct _PROTEIN_ where the _PROTEIN_ promoter was coupled to the gus reporter gene were examined . except for weak gus _PROTEIN_ signal in the vasculature and around hydathodes of developing leaves no _PROTEIN_ was found in the above ground structures of transgenic plants . however a closer inspection of early floral stages detected a temporally limited and moderate gus signal in developing anthers . at stages corresponding to pre meiosis and meiosis no signal was detected anther stages stages according to smyth et al . and sanders et al . respectively . at stages corresponding to early post meiosis a weak signal could be detected in the anthers . the _PROTEIN_ gus signal persisted and increased in intensity during anther and microspore development but was no longer present in the _PROTEIN_ stages of pollen development and at pollination . in anthers of different stages _PROTEIN_ gus activity was predominantly limited to the tapetum layer . no _PROTEIN_ was observed in the stamen filament . _PROTEIN_ gus activity could also be found accumulating in developing microspores at binucleate and trinucleate stages . this _PROTEIN_ was however very weak compared to the prominent _PROTEIN_ pattern in the tapetum . no _PROTEIN_ was found in the surrounding endothecium and epidermis layers _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . a gus _PROTEIN_ signal was also present in developing roots first in root tips of days old seedlings . speckled gus _PROTEIN_ was found throughout the lower part of the root in the root cap and _PROTEIN_ root cap but could also be found in the epidermis and in non epidermal tissue in the division and elongation zone . a more specific gus _PROTEIN_ pattern in the root was found in cells lining _PROTEIN_ root formation . this _PROTEIN_ pattern was found as early as surrounding two cell layer _PROTEIN_ roots and persisted to mark the site of _PROTEIN_ root initiation throughout their development . to further elucidate the _PROTEIN_ spatial and temporal _PROTEIN_ pattern in situ hybridization with an _PROTEIN_ riboprobe was performed . no _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was observed in the cells surrounding the vascular tissue the pericycle in the hypocotyl and the root of week old seedlings . a pronounced _PROTEIN_ pattern could however be found in pollen and tapetum early in anther development . as the tapetum cells degraded the tapetum and pollen _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ level also faded . in contrast to our gus results in situ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was also observed in the stamen filaments . no _PROTEIN_ was observed in the embryo during the stages of embryonic development tested . to our knowledge no t dna insertion knock out line or other mutant null alleles disrupting normal _PROTEIN_ function is publicly available at present . an alternative to studies of mutants is however studies of lines overexpressing a gene of interest . therefore the plants containing the inducible gvg _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overexpression construct were inspected for phenotypic effects after induction with dex . transgenic plants showed strong _PROTEIN_ of the ectopic _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion transcript after dex induction in addition to the endogenous _PROTEIN_ transcript . three independent gvg _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overexpression lines and wild type plants were grown on dex containing medium and after transferring them to soil weeks old plants were sprayed with dex every h for week . none of the seedlings from these lines showed any aberrant phenotype when grown on dex containing medium . in contrast the shoots in all the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overexpressing adult plants showed a reduced growth phenotype and developed fewer new floral buds compared to wt . in dex sprayed wt plants on average buds developed to flowers/siliques in h and the developing siliques and internodes between them elongated . in induced gvg _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants on average five buds developed to flowers/siliques in h. in the representative plant shown in fig . fertilization had already taken place at the onset of spraying in five of the flowers as judged from their developmental stage . from these flowers and to some extent flower siliques developed but the internodes between them did virtually not elongate and no further development was seen after the second spraying . there was apparently no increase in number of bolting buds after h . in contrast ten buds without visible sepals at h had developed into siliques after h in the wt plant shown in fig . . the floral organs of dex sprayed buds were inspected in plants at h. while induction of _PROTEIN_ led to a general developmental arrest a specific effect was seen on the gvg _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ stamen filaments as these showed a more severe defect in elongation and development compared to other organs in the flowers of overexpression lines . the length of filaments of the dex treated plants never reached the length of wt stage flowers . furthermore at stages corresponding to wt flower stages and the _METHOD_ anthers aborted development and degenerated leading to complete male sterility . at these stages carpels and papillar cells appeared normal . the phenotypic changes observed in the stamens were never seen in dex sprayed wt plants or other transgenic plants containing dex inducible constructs .
