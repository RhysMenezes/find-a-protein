amino acids stored in the _LOCATION_ are exported to the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ for protein synthesis however the molecular identity of _LOCATION_ amino acid exporters remains obscure in plants . here we demonstrate that the heterologous _PROTEIN_ of genes arabidopsis homologs of and encoding _LOCATION_ amino acid exporters in yeast reduces _LOCATION_ amino acid levels in the yeast cells . in vitro experiments revealed that labeled ala and pro are exported from _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ vesicles by in an _PROTEIN_ dependent manner . in arabidopsis fused with green _METHOD_ protein localizes to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . we propose that family represents the long sought for _LOCATION_ amino acid exporters in plants .
a homology search of the arabidopsis genome using the yeast _LOCATION_ amino acid transporter avt genes revealed homologs which were designated as atavts . they are categorized into three phylogenetically distinct subfamilies related to and . arabidopsis atavt proteins have been identified in various organelles by proteomic approaches . therefore we employed heterologous _PROTEIN_ system in yeasts to screen functional _LOCATION_ amino acid transporters . first to confirm successful _PROTEIN_ and the proper _LOCATION_ localization of atavt proteins in yeast cells _METHOD_ fused atavt proteins were _PROTEIN_ under the constitutive _PROTEIN_ promoter in yeast mutants . the subfamily comprises four members and _PROTEIN_ . we found that all the _METHOD_ fused related proteins except _PROTEIN_ were targeted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ which were labeled with the dye . in contrast _PROTEIN_ appeared to be associated with _LOCATION_ in the perinuclear region . _METHOD_ tagged predominantly accumulated at the _LOCATION_ but it partially localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . we failed to observe _METHOD_ signals in yeast cells _PROTEIN_ related genes fused with _METHOD_ . hence the heterologous experimental system was applied to the further functional analyses of the subfamily . we measured _LOCATION_ amino acid levels in yeast cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fused genes to examine whether these genes restore _LOCATION_ amino acid export in the mutants . the _LOCATION_ contents of various neutral amino acids such as thr ser asn gln gly ala val ile leu and pro which are the substrates of and were significantly increased in the yeast cells . in addition aromatic amino acids levels including tyr and phe appeared to be slightly higher in the yeast cells than in the wild type yeast cells although the differences were relatively minor compared to other neutral amino acids . as expected the _PROTEIN_ of in the yeast cells reduced the neutral amino acid levels approximately to their levels in the wild type cells . we also found that the _LOCATION_ amounts of these amino acids were reduced by the overproduction of and but not by _PROTEIN_ to the same extent as those of cells _PROTEIN_ . in contrast seemed to partially restore the export of neutral amino acids as the _LOCATION_ levels of thr ser asn gln val met and ile in the cells _PROTEIN_ were significantly lower than those in cells but were higher than those in wild type cells . similar results were obtained when related genes without _METHOD_ were _PROTEIN_ in yeast cells . under this condition the wild type and cells exhibited similar _LOCATION_ acidic and basic amino acid levels none of which were markedly affected by the _PROTEIN_ of yeast or arabidopsis related genes . although there may be minor differences in his levels between the wild type and cells these results suggested that neutral amino acids are the preferential substrates for and and to a lesser extent for . to provide direct evidence of the function of as a _LOCATION_ amino acid exporter we examined amino acid export activity mediated by _METHOD_ using _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ vesicles prepared from yeast cells . labeled ala was preloaded into isolated vesicles for min and then _PROTEIN_ was applied at a final concentration of mm . vesicles were collected at the indicated times and the radioactivity of ala retained in the vesicles was measured . upon _PROTEIN_ addition the radioactivity of ala rapidly _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ vesicles obtained from wild type _LOCATION_ suggesting active export of preloaded ala . this loss of ala was not observed in the absence of _PROTEIN_ . the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ vesicles failed to export preloaded ala but further accumulated ala likely via whereas _METHOD_ restored the export of ala in an _PROTEIN_ dependent manner . similar results were obtained using ser and pro as transport substrates . in contrast glu which is not a transport substrate of and was released from the vesicles independent of . the results are in good agreement with the _LOCATION_ amino acid contents described in fig . which supported the proposed function of in the export of various neutral amino acids . a glu residue in the putative sixth transmembrane domain is conserved among related proteins and suggested to be critical for transport activity . the corresponding residue in was replaced with ala and the mutated fused to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ in the yeast cells . this mutation did not affect the _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization of _METHOD_ fused . the _LOCATION_ contents of various neutral amino acids which were higher in the cells than in the wild type cells were reduced by as shown in figs and . in contrast the _PROTEIN_ of failed to reduce the amount of these amino acids in the _LOCATION_ of the cells . to further examine the transport activity of we prepared _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ vesicles from the cells that were transformed with either or . vesicles were preloaded with labeled amino acids and the radioactivities retained in the vesicles were measured in the presence or absence of _PROTEIN_ as described in fig . . in contrast to the vesicles with in which the level of ala rapidly _PROTEIN_ upon the addition of _PROTEIN_ ala was accumulated in vesicles with in the presence of _PROTEIN_ in a similar manner to that observed for the fission yeast . pro preloaded in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ vesicles of the cells immediately _PROTEIN_ in an _PROTEIN_ dependent manner by the _PROTEIN_ of but not . in contrast the export of preloaded glu from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ vesicles of the cells incubated with _PROTEIN_ was not affected by the _PROTEIN_ of or . these results suggested that functions in the active export of ala and pro but not glu and that a conserved _PROTEIN_ of is important for its transport activity . finally we determined subcellular localization of proteins in plant cells . rt pcr analyses illustrated that genes were ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ in various tissues of whole plants . to examine whether their transcript levels are affected by altered nitrogen availability day old seedlings grown in liquid culture media were transferred to low nitrate _PROTEIN_ media for days and then nitrate was added to low nitrate media _PROTEIN_ for h according to the method by scheible et al . . as expected nitrogen regulated genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were induced or suppressed under nitrogen limitation respectively . in contrast _PROTEIN_ of genes was not affected by nitrogen limitation or readdition of nitrate . in this study _METHOD_ fused genes were _PROTEIN_ under the control of camv promoter . as shown in fig . _METHOD_ was exclusively localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in protoplasts prepared from arabidopsis cell suspensions . in contrast _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ proteins were distributed within the _LOCATION_ and partially retained in the _LOCATION_ . to further support the _LOCATION_ localization of proteins in whole plants we prepared transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ which was n terminally fused to _METHOD_ . in every transgenic line examined _METHOD_ fused proteins were targeted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ .
