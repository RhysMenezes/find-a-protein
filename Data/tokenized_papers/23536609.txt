in yeasts and animals premature entry into mitosis is prevented by the inhibitory phosphorylation of cyclin dependent kinase by _PROTEIN_ kinase and at mitosis _PROTEIN_ protein is removed through the action of the proteasome . although in higher plants _PROTEIN_ function has been confirmed in the dna replication checkpoint arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ insertion mutants grow normally and a role for the protein in the _PROTEIN_ transition during an unperturbed plant cell cycle is yet to be confirmed . here data are presented showing that the inhibitory effect of _PROTEIN_ on cdk activity in tobacco by cell cultures is cell cycle regulated independently of the dna replication checkpoint it is high during s phase but drops as cells traverse _PROTEIN_ and enter mitosis . to investigate this mechanism further a yeast two hybrid screen was undertaken to identify proteins interacting with arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ . three f box proteins and a subunit of the proteasome complex were identified and bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation confirmed an interaction between _PROTEIN_ and the f box protein _PROTEIN_ interacting _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . furthermore the _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ signal in arabidopsis primary roots treated with the proteasome inhibitor was significantly increased compared with mock treated controls . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ per se in tobacco by cells resulted in a premature increase in the mitotic index compared with controls whereas co _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ negated this effect . these data support a role for _PROTEIN_ in a normal plant cell cycle and its removal at mitosis via the proteasome .
the _PROTEIN_ antibody recognized a single band in proteins extracted in lag exponential and stationary phase of a day subculture of by cells indicating good antibody specificity as shown previously with arabidopsis . the cdk inhibitory activity of was investigated using a _PROTEIN_ kinase inhibition assay based on that used with recombinant z. mays and solanum lycopersicum _PROTEIN_ proteins . this assay tests whether recombinant can inhibit cdk phosphorylation of histone in vitro . total cdk activity in this assay is interpreted as the inverse of _PROTEIN_ activity as previously demonstrated for homo sapiens _PROTEIN_ by . induction of in e. coli was tested by western blotting showing good specificity of the antibody purification of the recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein using his beads resulted in a single band of the expected on a _METHOD_ stained gel . addition of recombinant resulted in a fold _PROTEIN_ in cdk activity compared with cdk alone . this shows that recombinant protein produced in e. coli can negatively regulate cdk activity in vitro as do other plant _PROTEIN_ kinases . this is taken to indicate that the _PROTEIN_ is inhibiting cdk activity through its kinase activity . reduction in cdk activity elicited by the addition of recombinant . fusion protein induced in e. coli was purified by affinity purification and added to a kinase assay reaction containing cdks purified from wild type n. tabacum by cell culture protein extracts using beads and histone substrate compared with the cdk alone . a representative autoradiograph is shown below the histogram . the incorporation of was assayed by quantification of the bands on the autoradiograph . cell cycle regulation of _PROTEIN_ mrna protein and kinase activity in a synchronized wild type n.

immunodetection of protein extracted from synchrony samples and subjected to western blotting using the antibody . the histogram displays mean _PROTEIN_ protein levels as a ratio to an internal control . representative western blot and a _METHOD_ stain loading control are shown below the histogram . inhibition of cdk activity by . the incorporation of into histone was assayed by quantification of the bands on the autoradiographs and _PROTEIN_ as the percentage reduction in cdk activity _PROTEIN_ . cdk was pulled down from of by proteins . a representative autoradiograph is shown below the histogram . tobacco by cells were synchronized with aphidicolin and following removal of this reversible inhibitor of dna polymerase semi quantitative rt pcr generated histone profiles showed an s phase duration of . mitotic indices peaked at giving a cell cycle duration of _PROTEIN_ . the phase durations are highly comparable with previously published cell cycle data for by cells . _PROTEIN_ of peaked at and is also highly comparable with published data . _PROTEIN_ protein level was highest at _PROTEIN_ following the _PROTEIN_ mrna peak . _PROTEIN_ levels dropped significantly at _PROTEIN_ and remained low at _PROTEIN_ as more cells entered mitosis before showing a slight rise at _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ inhibition of cdk activity was maximal when _PROTEIN_ was pulled down from proteins extracted from by cells at _PROTEIN_ significantly by and again from to _PROTEIN_ and then remained at this level throughout _PROTEIN_ and m phase . the data are thus consistent in showing a drop in _PROTEIN_ kinase activity during _PROTEIN_ that remained low when cells entered mitosis . data for _PROTEIN_ protein and _PROTEIN_ inhibition of cdk activity suggest strongly that _PROTEIN_ is cell cycle regulated in by cells . however neither total protein nor activity levels disappeared . since only synchrony was achieved residual _PROTEIN_ kinase activity may derive from incomplete shut down throughout mitosis or persisted because of unsynchronized interphase cells . to test more precisely the levels of _PROTEIN_ protein during the cell cycle _METHOD_ signal was monitored during the synchronized cell cycle of a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ cell line compared with a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ control line . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was detected _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ and chromosomes with background/residual _METHOD_ signal in the cytoplasm . in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line _METHOD_ signal is greatly reduced in metaphase and early anaphase . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . yellow arrows indicate a representative cell scale bar for all images . _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ frequency of cells sampled from the synchronized _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ cell line . n values are indicated on each bar . contingency df p < . a clear _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was seen in interphase however signal associated with the chromosomes of early and _PROTEIN_ prophase cells was weaker followed by an almost complete absence of signal from chromosomes at metaphase and early anaphase but its re establishment in _PROTEIN_ anaphase and telophase . this pattern of alteration of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ intensity contrasts with a constant _METHOD_ signal _PROTEIN_ of cell cycle stage for the _METHOD_ line . quantification of _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ from > cells in both lines confirmed that in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line _METHOD_ signal was undetectable in metaphase cells and only very few prophase cells emitted signal . a contingency indicated a highly significant difference in the relative frequency of _METHOD_ between stages for the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line . in contrast in the _METHOD_ line all cells emitted a _METHOD_ signal and hence would be quantified as were it to be shown in . the dispersal of _PROTEIN_ during metaphase was also confirmed in arabidopsis roots . an arabidopsis line transformed with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct was crossed with a line transformed with the _LOCATION_ envelope marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in the resultant line the pattern of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal during the cell cycle is similar to that seen in by cells . in interphase a clear nucleoplasmic _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal is visible surrounded by _LOCATION_ envelope labelling of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . during metaphase _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal is essentially absent but a clear _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal can be observed in mitotic spindle _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal reappears in _PROTEIN_ anaphase/early telophase cells while _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is present in the reforming _LOCATION_ envelope and finally strong _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ signals were observed during cytokinesis . hence there is a remarkably precise cell cycle regulation of _PROTEIN_ with presumed degradation or destabilization of _PROTEIN_ when chromosomes align at the metaphase plate for both by cells and arabidopsis root cells . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_

in line a _METHOD_ signal could not be detected in any of the cells of the _PROTEIN_ root primordia . in contrast in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line strong _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was observed throughout the _PROTEIN_ root primordia . _PROTEIN_ root primordia of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines and and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ seedlings . green colouring indicates _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in two independent lines

determine whether the reduced _METHOD_ signal observed in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines was caused by proteasome mediated protein degradation . _METHOD_ signal clearly increased in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ seedlings treated with relative to the mock treated seedlings both in the root tips and further up the root . quantification of the _METHOD_ signal showed that there was a significant fold increase in _METHOD_ signal in the treated seedlings compared with the mock treated seedlings . this demonstrates that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein persists when the degradation route via the proteasome is blocked . and mock treated day old _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line seedlings . confocal images of root tips and more basal regions green indicates _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and red is propidium iodide

hybrid screen to search for interacting proteins that might play a regulatory role in its turnover . approximately transformants were screened from a library generated using arabidopsis primary and secondary root tips . over interactors were detected by an ability to grow on his medium and in a second screen for galactosidase activity of these were confirmed . sequencing of plasmid insertions revealed different _PROTEIN_ interaction partners of which were identified multiple times . functionally the interacting proteins could be divided into seven groups . of direct relevance to this work four proteins associated with ubiquitin mediated degradation were detected each one was only detected once . one of these is a regulatory subunit of the proteasome while the other three are f box proteins including _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . functional groups of proteins that interacted with _PROTEIN_ in a yeast two hybrid library screen bifc in by cells was used to verify the _PROTEIN_ interaction in plant cells initially by transient transformation . interacting proteins were mostly localized in the _LOCATION_ however the interaction was also detected at the cell wall especially at the junctions between adjacent cells . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ constructs were stably co transformed into by cells to study the dynamics of the interaction during the cell cycle . the frequency with which an interaction between _PROTEIN_ and was observed in each cell cycle phase was similar to that of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with a drop in interactions observed between interphase and prophase and interactions were not observed during metaphase . interactions were again observed during anaphase and telophase . tobacco by cells co transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_

was examined . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ resulted in a mitotic peak at compared with in wild type by cells . the mitotic peak was also earlier when _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in by cells in the bin hyg tx vector under an attenuated promoter . however when _METHOD_ was co _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ there was an interaction between the two proteins and the mitotic peak was restored to wild
