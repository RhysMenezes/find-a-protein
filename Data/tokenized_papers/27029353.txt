and are single pass _LOCATION_ proteins localized to the interphase between _LOCATION_ and the endosomal system . they might provide a basis for calcium regulation of endosomal vesicle transport .
and are two closely related paralogues residing in cml subfamily vii . similar to canonical _METHOD_ they have a cam domain comprising the characteristic double pair of ef hands . both proteins possess an n terminal extension that distinguishes them from other members of this subfamily and from the canonical _METHOD_ . taking as a reference these extensions span amino acids in and amino acids in . a subsequent comparison of the two n terminal domains revealed a marked sequence similarity especially in the first amino acids hinting towards a shared evolutionary descent and/or a similar function . initial support of the latter hypothesis comes from an in silico screen for signal peptides . different tools unanimously predict a subcellular targeting sequence at the n terminus of both proteins . however there was no unanimous agreement with respect to the predicted intracellular location of the proteins . according to the aramemnon plant _LOCATION_ protein database targeting of to the chloroplast or the secretory pathway is equally likely . in the case of the secretory pathway is clearly favoured . amino acid sequence alignment of and . black boxes indicate identical amino acid residues while grey boxes indicate a conserved amino acid substitution . black and grey bars above the sequence denote the four ef hands with their characteristic residue helix loop helix topology . asterisks mark conserved residues involved in coordination while the hash indicates a conserved glycine residue required for the conformational flexibility of the backbone . distribution of charged and hydrophobic residues within the signal anchor sequence of and . to get a more refined view on the subcellular location of and their subcellular localization was analysed in planta by their transient _PROTEIN_ as c terminal fusions to _METHOD_ in tobacco leaf cells . laser scanning confocal microscopy of protoplasts prepared from transformed leaf cells after agrobacterium infiltration showed the _METHOD_ signal of both proteins in small spherical structures that appeared throughout the cytoplasm of the cell . enlargement of these structures revealed a circular pattern and co transformation of _METHOD_ and mcherry showed that the two proteins co localize . in light of this finding paired with the high sequence similarity of and the majority of further analyses was performed with . _METHOD_ analysis of tobacco protoplasts transformed individually with _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ and co transformed with _METHOD_ and mcherry . subcellular localization of elucidated by staining of mitochondria with mito tracker red cmxros or co transformation of tobacco protoplasts with mcherry skl _LOCATION_ mcherry _LOCATION_ mcherry and _PROTEIN_ mcherry . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ is depicted in green mito tracker and mcherry _METHOD_ in magenta and chlorophyll _METHOD_ in red . the white bar within all images represents . enlargements are shown as inlays . the _METHOD_ signal showed no overlap with chlorophyll _METHOD_ demonstrating that _METHOD_ did not localize to the chloroplasts it was also absent from the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ . labelling of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protoplasts with mito tracker red cmxros and co _PROTEIN_ analysis with an mcherry tagged marker protein for _LOCATION_ revealed no overlap in _METHOD_ also excluding the mitochondria and _LOCATION_ as the potential target compartments of _METHOD_ . furthermore co _PROTEIN_ analyses were performed with established marker proteins that label the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and multivesicular bodies /endosomes _PROTEIN_ respectively . _PROTEIN_ and both displayed a predominantly dot like signal as described previously and as seen exclusively in single transformations . however upon co transformation with _METHOD_ spherical structures became evident for both proteins . moreover a partial but not complete overlap with the signal from _METHOD_ was observed for both marker proteins exclusively in these spherical structures . together these results indicate that resides in vesicular structures within the interphase between the _LOCATION_ and the mvbs/endosomes and circulation dynamics within these endomembrane compartments are the likely cause for the partial co localization . importantly because transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ tagged and in arabidopsis protoplasts controlled by their respective endogenous promoters results in a similar _METHOD_ signal pattern the observed signal in tobacco protoplasts is not an artefact caused by promoter driven overexpression . to further confirm these findings microsome fractions from tobacco leaf cells _PROTEIN_ either _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ mcherry were mixed after isolation and further separated on a sucrose density gradient . using this approach any influence of the _PROTEIN_ of on the localization of _PROTEIN_ and vice versa was avoided . all fractions were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and subsequently probed with antibodies against _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ to detect _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ mcherry respectively . antibodies against sterol methyltransferase _PROTEIN_ an _LOCATION_ integral _LOCATION_ protein and adp ribosylation _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a protein found in the _LOCATION_ and the trans _LOCATION_ network were used to detect endogenous proteins of these compartments . while _PROTEIN_ was clearly separated from the other proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and signals were all found distributed in the same fractions of the gradient supporting the dynamic localization of . separation of isolated microsomes _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ mcherry by sucrose density gradient centrifugation . top down aliquots of fractions as indicated were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and analysed by western blot using _METHOD_ to detect _METHOD_ _METHOD_ to detect _PROTEIN_ mcherry and antibodies against _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to detect endogenous proteins of the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ respectively . extraction of _LOCATION_ proteins using isolated microsomes from tobacco leaf cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _LOCATION_ mcherry or chloroplasts from tobacco leaf cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ya . extraction was performed with nacl _PROTEIN_ urea or _PROTEIN_ . aliquots of supernatant and pellet fractions were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and proteins were visualized by western blot using tag specific antibodies . thermolysin treatment of microsomes from tobacco leaf cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ or _LOCATION_ mcherry . proteins were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and proteins were visualized by western blot using tag specific antibodies . in the next step the question was addressed whether the in silico predicted n terminal targeting signal indeed mediates subcellular targeting . a series of _METHOD_ tagged truncated variants of was generated and their subcellular localization investigated . notably the variant lacking the first amino acids _METHOD_ which are strongly conserved between and showed a uniform _METHOD_ pattern devoid of any vesicular structures . the pattern is similar to that observed with _LOCATION_ protein _METHOD_ indicating that the protein is no longer targeted into the endomembrane system . by contrast a variant comprising only the first amino acids of _METHOD_ showed the same spherical pattern as the full length protein _METHOD_ . these results strongly indicate that the first amino acids of are both essential and sufficient for targeting of the protein into the endomembrane system . _METHOD_ analysis of tobacco leaf cell protoplasts transformed with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and a _LOCATION_ marker _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ analysis of tobacco leaf cell protoplasts co transformed with the _METHOD_ pairs _METHOD_ cyt _METHOD_ _METHOD_ cyt _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and cyt _METHOD_ cyt _METHOD_ . the white bar within all images represents . the spherical pattern observed for the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ indicates that the protein is associated with the vesicle _LOCATION_ rather than localized inside the vesicle lumen . in line with this observation a set of programmes for transmembrane domain prediction indicated a potential transmembrane helix in the n terminus of both and that partially overlaps with the targeting sequence . this region therefore resembles the transmembrane domain of typical single pass _LOCATION_ proteins . to confirm the integration of into the _LOCATION_ extraction experiments using isolated microsomal fractions from tobacco cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _LOCATION_ mcherry _LOCATION_ were performed . as a control chloroplast _LOCATION_ isolated from tobacco cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tagged chloroplast _PROTEIN_ from a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ were used because _PROTEIN_ is also a single pass _LOCATION_ protein . western blot analysis confirmed the presence of the tagged proteins in the microsomal or chloroplast _LOCATION_ pellet . as expected treatment of _LOCATION_ with either nacl or alkaline _PROTEIN_ could not extract the majority of the _PROTEIN_ protein from the _LOCATION_ fraction . behaved in a manner very similar to _PROTEIN_ with only minor signals observed in the supernatant of the _PROTEIN_ extraction _METHOD_ . by contrast was found in the supernatant after alkaline _PROTEIN_ treatment _LOCATION_ because it converts vesicles into sheets and thus releases their soluble content as well as proteins peripherally associated with the _LOCATION_ . only integral proteins remain associated with the _LOCATION_ under these conditions . control treatments with urea or _PROTEIN_ resulted in a release of all proteins into the soluble fraction . the same extraction experiments were performed with isolated microsomes from tobacco cells _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ variant and demonstrated a very similar extraction pattern as _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . together these results strongly support as a single pass _LOCATION_ protein with an n terminal signal anchor within its first amino acids . the finding that is anchored to the _LOCATION_ raises the question of whether the c terminal cam domain is luminal or exposed to the _LOCATION_ surface . to address this question isolated microsomes _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ or _LOCATION_ mcherry were treated with thermolysin before western blot analysis . immunodecoration clearly showed that the luminal _LOCATION_ marker protein is fully protected from degradation by thermolysin . by contrast both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ can be degraded by the protease indicating that the c terminally fused _METHOD_ protein that reacts with the antibody and thus the c terminal cam domain of is exposed to the outside of the microsomal vesicles . to confirm the topology of the _METHOD_ system was employed . in this system the first beta sheets _METHOD_ and the beta sheet _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ are fused to different proteins . owing to the high affinity of these moieties they self assemble to a functional _METHOD_ if they are present in the same compartment resulting in a _METHOD_ signal . to show that this system can mark a specific compartment if one of the partners is integral to the _LOCATION_ with the _METHOD_ domain exposed to the surface and the other partner is a _LOCATION_ protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was transformed together with cyt _METHOD_ into tobacco mesophyll cells . their co _PROTEIN_ resulted in _PROTEIN_ like _METHOD_ signals around the chloroplasts . co _PROTEIN_ of two _LOCATION_ proteins resulted in the characteristic diffuse signal throughout the cell _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . when _METHOD_ was co transformed with cyt _METHOD_ a clear _METHOD_ signal could be observed in spherical structures like those observed for _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . co _PROTEIN_ of with the _LOCATION_ marker _METHOD_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ _METHOD_ also resulted in the typical spherical structures confirming that and share the same localization and topology . outside their n terminal extension and contain a cam domain with high sequence similarity to canonical _METHOD_ including four ef hands with their characteristic residue helix loop helix topology . the residues involved in coordination as well as the small required for the conformational flexibility of the backbone are all conserved in these cmls . when analysed in vitro recombinant and lacking the signal anchor sequence displayed a faster migration on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the presence of compared to the same sample run in the absence of . this characteristic a dependent mobility shift upon _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ separation has previously been associated with binding of calcium ions to the ef hands of _METHOD_ . furthermore binds to phenyl sepharose in the presence of and can be eluted when is replaced by edta/egta . these are both characteristic features of canonical _METHOD_ and indicate that and can act as typical cam proteins . plants contain a vast number of different cmls indicating a strong diversification of this calcium sensor family . they fall into various subfamilies that appear to be differentially distributed throughout the plant kingdom . members of the clade are found exclusively in flowering plants . unfortunately the identification of orthologues for and among these proteins was substantially hindered by the generally very high sequence similarity of the cam domain among all members of the clade . this is most likely a result of a functional constraint restricting the evolution of this domain which renders it unsuitable for a high resolution inference of evolutionary relationships among the homologues . therefore we used the presence of an n terminal extension as the indicative characteristic to assign sequences as putative members of the subfamily . using this restriction like proteins could not be identified in the early branching magnoliophyte amborella trichopoda and only two like proteins were found in the monocots . a like protein was found in the basal eudicot nelumbo nucifera and at least one ortholog was found in core eudicots . the n terminal extensions of all like proteins display sequence similarity to both and . in particular the region of the signal anchor sequence is highly conserved suggesting that all these proteins might be targeted into the endomembrane system . to trace the evolutionary history of this gene family we performed a phylogenetic analysis on a representative subset of proteins spanning the full taxonomic diversity of plants where these proteins have been identified . the resulting tree places the sequences from the brassicaceae in two well supported monophyletic clades for and respectively . moreover all brassicaceae and sequences share a common ancestry to the exclusion of the proteins from other plants . this indicates that the gene duplication event that gave rise to contemporary and most likely occurred in the last common ancestor of the brassicaceae . amino acid sequence alignment of the n terminal extension of proteins from species representing different orders of flowering plants . black boxes indicate identical amino acid residues while grey boxes indicate similar amino acids . phylogenetic relationship of like proteins from different orders of flowering plants . phylogenetic tree construction was performed by maximum likelihood based on the sequence alignment provided in supplementary fig . . for accession numbers see supplementary table . a distribution of plants with like proteins within the different
