plant hormones cytokinins _PROTEIN_ are one of the major mediators of physiological responses throughout plant life span . therefore a proper homeostasis is _PROTEIN_ by regulation of their active levels . besides degradation _PROTEIN_ are deactivated by uridine diphosphate glycosyltransferases . physiologically _PROTEIN_ active levels decline in senescing organs providing a signal to nutrients that a shift to reproductive tissues has begun . in this work we show _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ distribution in arabidopsis leaves during major developmental transition phases . besides continuous accumulation of n _PROTEIN_ we detected sharp maximum of the _PROTEIN_ in senescence . this is caused prevalently by _PROTEIN_ followed by _PROTEIN_ and specifically also by trans zeatin o _PROTEIN_ . interestingly we observed a similar trend in response to exogenously applied _PROTEIN_ . in arabidopsis only three ugts deactivate _PROTEIN_ in vivo _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . we thereby show that _PROTEIN_ is specifically _PROTEIN_ in senescent leaves whereas _PROTEIN_ is activated rapidly in response to exogenously applied _PROTEIN_ . to shed more light on the ugts physiological roles we performed a comparative study on ugts loss of function mutants characterizing a true _PROTEIN_ loss of function mutant for the first time . although no altered phenotype was detected under standard condition we observed reduced chlorophyll degradation with increased anthocyanin accumulation in our experiment on detached leaves accompanied by senescence and stress related genes modulated _PROTEIN_ . among the mutants _PROTEIN_ possessed extremely diminished _PROTEIN_ n _PROTEIN_ levels whereas _PROTEIN_ showed some specificity toward cis zeatin . besides tzog a broader range of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ . performing _PROTEIN_ metabolism gene _PROTEIN_ profiling we revealed that activation of _PROTEIN_ degradation pathway serves as a general regulatory mechanism of disturbed _PROTEIN_ homeostasis followed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ signaling in all ugt mutants . in contrast a specific regulation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was observed for each individual ugt mutant isoform after exogenous _PROTEIN_ uptake . employing an in silico prediction we proposed _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ that we further confirmed by _METHOD_ tagging of _PROTEIN_ . integrating all the results we therefore hypothesize that ugts possess different physiological roles in arabidopsis and serve as a fine tuning mechanism of active _PROTEIN_ levels in _LOCATION_ .
to determine _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ status during arabidopsis leaf senescence levels of isoprenoid _PROTEIN_ and their respective ribosides ribotides and _PROTEIN_ were determined under standard growth conditions in four time points covering the _PROTEIN_ developmental transition phases green mature leaves of non flowering and flowering rosettes and green and senescent leaves from pod forming plants . generally n _PROTEIN_ accumulated during leaf aging with sharp maximum of _PROTEIN_ in yellowing stage of the leaf aging . it might seem that _PROTEIN_ o _PROTEIN_ fluctuated in an opposite way to _PROTEIN_ nucleotides when summed up however figure illustrates flowering time related increase of all o _PROTEIN_ except dhzog and tzog that accumulated in aging dependent manner . our results point out that tzog is the _PROTEIN_ o _PROTEIN_ present in arabidopsis senescent leaves since its level arose almost seven times in comparison to other _PROTEIN_ o _PROTEIN_ in this time point . indeed we observed a decline in active _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with fluctuation characteristic for each form . interestingly cz and particularly czr levels increased in senescent leaf which is in accordance with previous work . it should be noted that the content of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was more than one order of magnitude higher than active _METHOD_ . cytokinin content of wt a. thaliana leaves during transitions between vegetative reproductive and senescence stages . the time points were green fully developed leaves from a non flowering rosette a flowering rosette from a plant with maturing pods and senescent leaves from the same plant days after sowing . the overall distribution of cytokinins grouped by types of their _METHOD_ and with a focus on individual _METHOD_ active cytokinins cytokinin n _PROTEIN_ and cytokinin o _PROTEIN_ . values are the means of three biological replicates sd . up to date the ugts _PROTEIN_ was assessed only in young developing tissues _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . according to our data arabidopsis accumulated large quantities of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in leaves in age dependent manner so that we employed gene _PROTEIN_ profiling to determine which ugts are specific in _PROTEIN_ deactivation process during senescence . we show that the most upregulated _PROTEIN_ specific ugt was _PROTEIN_ whose _PROTEIN_ is specifically boosted in senescent leaves followed by br specific _PROTEIN_ . we detected significantly downregulated _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ with age dependent manner but without specificity in yellowing leaf . steady _PROTEIN_ was detected for _PROTEIN_ throughout the developmental stages whereas varying _PROTEIN_ was detected for _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ gene was used as a control of senescence progress that reflects photosynthesis status . consistently downregulated _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in senescent leaves correlates with previously published data . gene _PROTEIN_ profile in leaves of arabidopsis cytokinin specific ugts during plant development and after cytokinin treatment . ygl young green leaf das gl green fully developed leaf sl senescent leaf . in the experiment where transcript level in response to exogenously applied cytokinin was analyzed green mature fully expanded leaves from weeks old rosette were used and treated by cytokinins for days . the gene _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ as relative quantities and extrapolated relative to the gl das and mock treatment respectively given as . the values represent means of three biological replicates with standard deviations . asterisks indicate significant differences between the controls and the samples according to unpaired student s t test < < lod below limit of detection . to compare ugts in their response to various exogenously applied _PROTEIN_ we analyzed modulation of ugts _PROTEIN_ in detached leaves in response to kin bap ip and tz respectively . generally no significant difference in transcript level was detected in all but _PROTEIN_ whose transcript level was increased enormously in response to all the tested _PROTEIN_ with the highest increase after kin uptake in comparison to mock treatment . _PROTEIN_ was sensitive only to tz treatment which increased its _PROTEIN_ only mildly times . surprisingly the second _PROTEIN_ n specific _PROTEIN_ glycosyltransferase showed no response to any of the _PROTEIN_ on transcript level . in order to correlate increased transcript level of _PROTEIN_ after exogenously applied _PROTEIN_ we determined _PROTEIN_ content in detached leaves after kin treatment _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and in whole week old rosettes in response to tz . subsequently the most prevalent _PROTEIN_ types and _METHOD_ were analyzed . after tz uptake a strong interfering effect in _METHOD_ of extremely elevated tz type _PROTEIN_ was observed . further all dhz type _PROTEIN_ arose as well . consistently with previous studies _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were the predominant _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ deactivation pathway since strong increase of and were detected after tz uptake followed by its o _PROTEIN_ . and tzog were the most significantly elevated _PROTEIN_ when leaves were treated by kin . both treatments resulted in abolished _PROTEIN_ biosynthesis as manifested by general decline of all ip type _PROTEIN_ and particularly of tzrmp in case of kin treatment . interestingly cz level rose after tz uptake whereas no change was detected in kin experiment . since kin does not interfere with native arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ content but triggers the same _PROTEIN_ response in arabidopsis we used kin to study _PROTEIN_ mediated response in ugt mutants . cytokinin content in whole plants of wt a. thaliana after tz treatment and in detached leaves after kin treatment . values are the means of three biological replicates with _LOCATION_ bars that represent standard deviations . asterisks over bars indicate significant differences between kin treated and mock control plants according to two tailed unpaired student s t test < < < . in this study _PROTEIN_ was shown on transcript level to be the major form responsible for _PROTEIN_ inactivation during senescence . however the _PROTEIN_ mutant did not show apparent phenotypic alteration under normal growth conditions . in order to investigate expected enhanced sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ mutant to exogenously applied _PROTEIN_ a rooting test was performed using bap ip and tz in and concentrations . no significant difference in _PROTEIN_ root length or in number of _PROTEIN_ roots was observed after any of the treatments . since no phenotype difference was observed on whole plant level in any of developmental stages analyzed we performed an experiment where senescence was induced by leaves detachment . after days of incubation the leaves of _PROTEIN_ mutant showed apparent enhanced accumulation of anthocyanins . this was further verified by the anthocyanin assay that confirmed fold increase of anthocyanins in _PROTEIN_ . similarly chlorophyll content was measured showing reduced chlorophyll degradation in _PROTEIN_ mutant . in order to show senescence status of the mutant in this experiment we determined gene _PROTEIN_ of senescence and stress associated genes together with genes responsible for anthocyanin biosynthesis _PROTEIN_ . relative _PROTEIN_ of all the senescence and stress marker genes was lower in _PROTEIN_ mutant in comparison to the wt control with significant reduction of gene transcript of the key enzyme responsible for abscisic acid biosynthesis _PROTEIN_ . higher relative _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ gene coding for one of the core anthocyanin biosynthetic enzymes further supports observed enhanced anthocyanin accumulation . taken together our data suggest important role of _PROTEIN_ in senescence process . characterization of _PROTEIN_ mutant . detached leaves of wt and the mutant after days of continuous light chlorophyll content anthocyanin content and gene _PROTEIN_ profile of senescence and stress related markers including anthocyanin biosynthetic gene _PROTEIN_ . values are the means of two independent experiments where leaves of ten individual plants were pooled and _PROTEIN_ as relative quantities extrapolated to wt control that is given as with _LOCATION_ bars representing standard deviations . asterisks indicate significant difference between wt and transgenic tissue according to two tailed unpaired student s t test < < . we determined _PROTEIN_ profile of _PROTEIN_ in day old seedlings . as indicated in figure our data show significant _PROTEIN_ in tzog level that is in accordance with previously published data where _PROTEIN_ was proposed to specifically o _PROTEIN_ tz based on _PROTEIN_ overexpressor characterization . our data further point out that this ugt might possibly _PROTEIN_ also other _PROTEIN_ since significantly _PROTEIN_ levels of almost all o _PROTEIN_ as well as and were detected . however this could be due to other uncharacterized regulatory processes that occur in the mutant . although some of the active _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ particularly ip ipr cz czr and tzr _PROTEIN_ nucleotides somewhat increased . no change in any of _PROTEIN_ was observed in our data . cytokinin content of week old seedlings of _PROTEIN_ mutant . values are the means of three biological replicates with _LOCATION_ bars representing standard deviations . asterisks over bars indicate significant difference between wild type and the mutant according to two tailed unpaired student s t test < < < . based on our knowledge of plant ability to restore impaired _PROTEIN_ homeostasis by modulation of gene _PROTEIN_ and of the _PROTEIN_ that only minor regulation effect was detected in _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ we performed an experiment on detached leaves to uncouple the leaf response from whole plant level . we further treated the leaves with exogenously applied kin to cease _PROTEIN_ biosynthesis thereby boosting visibility of plant s response to applied _PROTEIN_ with focus on _PROTEIN_ . subsequently we analyzed _PROTEIN_ content of all the _PROTEIN_ specific ugt loss of function mutants in response to exogenously applied kin . in order to compare the _PROTEIN_ content of wt and ugts in general we grouped _PROTEIN_ by _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and compared their overall ratios as illustrates figure . here it can be noticed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ shared a similar pattern of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ distribution in general whereas _PROTEIN_ showed significantly altered ratio caused _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ n _PROTEIN_ portion . n _PROTEIN_ were in _PROTEIN_ almost depleted in _PROTEIN_ as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ whereas they were just moderately _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . figure also shows a portion of o _PROTEIN_ that are _PROTEIN_ in all the mutants and particularly in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ under non treated condition . interestingly higher amounts of o _PROTEIN_ were detected after kin uptake in contrast to non treated leaves in all genotypes with the lowest amounts in _PROTEIN_ . when _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are presented as individual _PROTEIN_ types in absolute numbers it can be concluded that the ugts are not specific for any particular _PROTEIN_ type since _PROTEIN_ of all _PROTEIN_ types were _PROTEIN_ in all the three analyzed mutants . figure describes the contents of all individual _PROTEIN_ in detail . neither _PROTEIN_ nor _PROTEIN_ showed any specificity for or _PROTEIN_ since both groups of _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ which is in accordance with previous data _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . however kin treatment of _PROTEIN_ revealed significantly lower level of that was not determined in previous studies . major contributors of total o _PROTEIN_ levels are tzog and czrog . we detected significantly _PROTEIN_ tzog levels generally in all the mutants under both conditions whereas the levels of czrog stayed steady . interestingly lower levels of czog were measured in _PROTEIN_ under both conditions . the levels of active _PROTEIN_ and their biosynthetic _METHOD_ are in accordance with our previous experiment with kin treatment since lower levels of ip and iprmp were detected after kin uptake in general as a result of proposed abolished _PROTEIN_ biosynthesis . lower levels of tz under non treated condition together with lower levels of tzr and depleted tzrmp levels after kin uptake were assessed in all the mutants pointing to the plant s need to restore the homeostasis caused by impaired _PROTEIN_ especially when more stress caused by excessive supply of exogenous _PROTEIN_ was applied . cytokinin content in detached leaves of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants after kinetin treatment . ratio among _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in mock treatment and kin

riboside with their corresponding o _PROTEIN_ and n _PROTEIN_ plus ribotides values are the means of three biological replicates with _LOCATION_ bars representing standard deviations . asterisks over bars indicate significant difference according to two tailed unpaired student s t test < < < where for each replicate sixth and seventh green fully developed leaves from ten independent day old rosettes were pooled for control mock treatment and kin treatment . detailed cytokinin content in detached leaves of wt _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . n _PROTEIN_ content in control mock treatment and after kin treatment o _PROTEIN_ content in control mock treatment and after kin treatment and _PROTEIN_ free bases together with their ribosides and ribotides in control mock treatment and after kin treatment . values are the means of three biological replicates with _LOCATION_ bars representing standard deviations . asterisks over bars indicate significant differences between wild type and the mutants according to two tailed unpaired student s t test < < < . gene _PROTEIN_ of major _PROTEIN_ metabolic pathways perception and response was analyzed in detached leaves of ugt mutants after kin treatment as well as in control mock treatment . figure illustrates rq of the gene transcripts in a heat map . here _PROTEIN_ of majority of degradation pathway genes was increased in all the mutants particularly in non treated group and specifically also in _PROTEIN_ after kin uptake . the most upregulated form was _PROTEIN_ followed by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . a different pattern was detected for _PROTEIN_ since this isoform was downregulated in _PROTEIN_ mutant after kin uptake whereas upregulated in the remaining two mutants . similarly _PROTEIN_ transcript level was specifically increased in _PROTEIN_ mutant but slightly suppressed in _PROTEIN_ and not modulated in _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ form was slightly downregulated in _PROTEIN_ in both conditions but upregulated in _PROTEIN_ after kin uptake . _PROTEIN_ biosynthesis was generally only modestly _PROTEIN_ when not treated by _PROTEIN_ with mutant dependent exceptions . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts were more abundant in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ whereas transcript level of _PROTEIN_ was increased specifically in _PROTEIN_ mutant . majority of ipt genes were slightly elevated after kin treatment when compared to wt . although _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ shared a somewhat similar trend as when not treated _PROTEIN_ behaved in an opposite way in _PROTEIN_ mutant . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ increased in order wt < _PROTEIN_ < _PROTEIN_ < _PROTEIN_ both in plants not treated and treated with kin but the increase was more pronounced after the treatment . _PROTEIN_ was downregulated in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants when not treated and _PROTEIN_ increased in _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ transcript _PROTEIN_ in all the mutants in both conditions as well as _PROTEIN_ significance for _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was specifically _PROTEIN_ in both mutants after kin uptake . two out of three examined a type arr were upregulated in response to kin . _PROTEIN_ profiles of cytokinin metabolism perception and response genes under standard conditions and after kinetin treatment in detached leaves of a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutants . the gene _PROTEIN_ of the mutant plants are _PROTEIN_ as relative quantities and extrapolated relative to the mock treatment and kin treated wt respectively given as . the values represent means of three biological replicates with standard deviations . asterisks indicate significant differences between controls and samples according to two tailed unpaired student s t test < < lod below limit of detection . no _PROTEIN_ was detected for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the only _PROTEIN_ specific ugt with confirmed subcellular localization is _PROTEIN_ detected in _LOCATION_ . that was in strong contrast with its in silico prediction by wolf psort prediction tool _PROTEIN_ . in that study _PROTEIN_ was predicted as part of the class to be a _LOCATION_ associated enzyme with targeting to chloroplasts and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the authors further showed that the _PROTEIN_ protein contains the xkqxxef motif for microsome retention and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ retention signal qksq at the c terminus as well as several posttranslational modification sites suggesting high level of posttranslational modification _PROTEIN_ . however confirmed localization to _LOCATION_ accords with generally accepted presumption that plant ugts are _LOCATION_ enzymes . here we performed a signal peptide prediction of the remaining _PROTEIN_ specific ugts using available prediction software . similar to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ localization is predicted to chloroplast according to signal peptide prediction analysis . since _PROTEIN_ is one of the core _PROTEIN_ homeostasis genes we examined its subcellular localization using confocal laser scanning microscopy using _METHOD_ tagging . as shown in figure the _METHOD_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ displayed diffuse _METHOD_ in _LOCATION_ accumulating along the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and in _LOCATION_ thus proving _PROTEIN_ to be a _LOCATION_ enzyme . we suggest the same localization for _PROTEIN_ based on our signal peptide prediction and comparison . prediction of a signal peptide in protein sequences of ugts and model proteins . subcellular localization analysis of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein . green channel and

characterized _PROTEIN_ . supplementary figures illustrates schematic of t dna positions within the _PROTEIN_ gene . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines were confirmed for their t dna insertion position homozygosity and gene _PROTEIN_ level in rt pcr . our results showed that _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in wt but not in the _PROTEIN_ mutant while a weak _PROTEIN_ was detected in _PROTEIN_ mutant . remaining loss of function mutants of _PROTEIN_ specific ugts used in this work were analyzed for presence of their t dna insertion and its effect in previous publications _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . no redundancy effect of any of the _PROTEIN_ specific ugts was detected in any of the mutants used in this work based on their gene _PROTEIN_ quantification . sterilized seeds of arabidopsis wild type and _PROTEIN_ were transferred to vertical square petri dishes on a solid _METHOD_ medium containing mes and sucrose as well as various concentrations of bap ip dihydrozeatin and tz respectively . _METHOD_ was used in control since that was the final concentration in all _PROTEIN_ treatments . after stratification the seeds were germinated and grown in an environmental chamber

epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase _PROTEIN_ a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of abscisic acid _PROTEIN_ . rna from three biological replicates was transcribed in at least two independent reactions and each cdna sample was run in at least three technical replications on real time pcr system in a default program . to evaluate a relative quantification of analyzed genes cycle threshold values were analyzed

_PROTEIN_ as a shuttle vector and _PROTEIN_ binary vector was used for _METHOD_ gene fusion and subsequent overexpression of the _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ gene in tomato hairy roots under a super ubiquitin promoter as described in our previous work . the gene for _PROTEIN_ was synthetized using commercial service with cds as a template sequence without any modifications . bamhi restriction sites were added to the sequence to enable further sub cloning of the synthetic gene from the source pmk rq vector . use of bamhi digestion and further ligation to _PROTEIN_ vector resulted in in
