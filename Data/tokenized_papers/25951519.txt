protein terminal acetylation represents one of the most abundant protein modifications of higher eukaryotes . in humans six acetyltransferases are responsible for the acetylation of approximately of the _LOCATION_ proteins . n terminal protein acetylation has not been evidenced in organelles of metazoans but in higher plants is a widespread modification not only in the _LOCATION_ but also in the chloroplast . in this study we identify and characterize the first organellar localized nat in eukaryotes . a primary sequence based search in arabidopsis thaliana revealed seven putatively _LOCATION_ localized nats of which _PROTEIN_ showed the highest conservation of the acetyl coa binding pocket . the chloroplastic localization of was demonstrated by transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ in arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts . homology modeling uncovered a significant conservation of _PROTEIN_ structural elements between human and . the in vivo acetylation activity of was demonstrated on a number of distinct protein termini with a newly established global acetylome profiling test after _PROTEIN_ of in e. coli . predominately acetylated proteins starting with m a s and t providing an explanation for most protein n termini acetylation events found in chloroplasts . like displays acetyltransferase activity on three internal lysine residues . all _METHOD_ data have been deposited in the proteomexchange with identifier .
several studies demonstrated the presence of acetylated n termini from _LOCATION_ localized proteins . however the few characterized plant nat proteins are all localized in the _LOCATION_ and thus could not be responsible for the n terminal acetylation of these proteins . in a search of _LOCATION_ nats sequences of known nats from human yeast and arabidopsis were used as templates in a blast search on tair to find unknown nat candidates . this sequence homology based search revealed putative nats in the arabidopsis genome . according to the subcellular proteomic database seven of the candidates are predicted to localize in chloroplast . the protein encoded by _PROTEIN_ displayed the highest conservation of the acetyl coa binding motif rxxgxg/a which is conserved in all major nats of eukaryotes . transcription of the _PROTEIN_ gene has been verified by qrt pcr in roots stem flower rosette and cauline leaves as according to and was found to be approximately five fold higher in rosette and cauline leaves when compared to non green tissues . however _PROTEIN_ is ubiquitously transcribed during development of arabidopsis thaliana according to public available transcriptome profiling repository databases . we decided to use the structural information of for a modeling approach based on pairwise alignment to gain more information about _PROTEIN_ . after removal of the putative transit peptide domain a partial model of _PROTEIN_ was obtained by modeling residues and to followed by superposition of both domains on . the c domain included the conserved nat_sf domain that is known to bind the acetyl coa molecule by the rxxgxg/a motif . two residues of this motif together with charged/polar residues such as and were recognized to contribute to the modeled acetyl coa binding pocket of _PROTEIN_ . the superimposed n domain and c domain of _PROTEIN_ resemble remarkably the _PROTEIN_ structure of at the corresponding areas . thus we named _PROTEIN_ according to the revised nat nomenclature system . the n and c domain of were separated by a linker region that is absent in . structure modeling of chloroplastic _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis thaliana . superposition of modeled n domain and c domain from _PROTEIN_ with the template is shown . the enzyme structures are in cartoon representation whereas coa molecule is displayed in sticks representation . the modeled domains are labeled by the first and the last modeled residues . enlargement of modeled _PROTEIN_ c domain harboring a coa molecule . the coa molecule and selected residues that probably interact with coa are shown in stick presentation . schematic representation of _PROTEIN_ domain organization . tp transit peptide . structural alignment of n and c domains with

green areas represent helices yellow areas indicate strands . is predicted by targetp server to target exclusively to the chloroplast . in order to confirm its subcellular localization fused to _METHOD_ at the c terminus was transiently _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts . the _METHOD_ signal perfectly overlaid with chloroplast auto _METHOD_ demonstrating its chloroplastic localization . no _METHOD_ signal was detected in control protoplasts _PROTEIN_ the empty _METHOD_ vector . is localized in chloroplasts . full length _PROTEIN_ in fusion with efyp was ectopically _PROTEIN_ under control of the promotor in mesophyll protoplasts extracted from six week old arabidopsis leaves . the _METHOD_ signal of eyp perfectly overlap with chlorophyll auto _METHOD_ determined in the same protoplasts . protoplasts transiently transformed with the empty _METHOD_ vector display chlorophyll auto _METHOD_ but no specific efyp signal using the same settings . lacking the chloroplastic transit peptide in fusion with the histidine tag and the maltose binding protein was _PROTEIN_ in e. coli cells where acetylation is a very rare event . thus the comparison of the n terminal status of the wild type e. coli proteome with the proteome of cells _PROTEIN_ mbp or other plant naas should reveal n termini of proteins acetylated by the recombinant plant proteins . as controls the already characterized enzymatically active subunit and its auxiliary subunit of the plant nata complex were also _PROTEIN_ in e. coli as mbp tagged fusion proteins . after scx lc enrichment n termini enriched fractions were analyzed by lc _METHOD_ to determine the _PROTEIN_ frequency of the bacterial proteome induced by the _PROTEIN_ of the plant nat subunit . using this large scale proteomics approach more than peptides were identified which correspond to more than non redundant protein n termini in each sample . as expected only acetylated peptides were identified in the proteome of cells _PROTEIN_ the mbp of which were acetylated also in wild type e. coli cells . in contrast the proteome of cells _PROTEIN_ mbp comprised acetylated n termini of which peptides were specifically found in cells _PROTEIN_ . the almost fold increase in acetylation of protein n termini demonstrated the suitability of the here proposed gap approach for identification of substrate peptides . only of the uniquely found acetylated peptides in the presence of starts with an imet that is predominantly followed by a negatively charged amino residue . the bulk of acetylated peptides correspond to peptides derived from proteins that were subjected to imet removal which matches the in vivo substrate specificity of other eukaryotic . in an alternative in vitro methodology a proteome derived peptide library was used to characterize substrate specificity of purified . this approach evidenced a strong activity of the against glu starting n termini . this _PROTEIN_ of glu starting n termini by free could not be observed for free in the gap approach . however we could confirm the promoting function of glu and asp residues at position for acetylation of n termini by free that was also demonstrated for with the proteome derived peptide library approach . a newly established _METHOD_ based in vivo nat activity test demonstrates enzymatic acetylation activity of . number of identified acetylated n terminal peptides after digestion of e. coli soluble protein lysates with trypsin and enrichment of n terminal peptides by scx . wild type e. coli and e. coli cells _PROTEIN_ either the auxiliary subunit or the catalytically active subunit of nata were analyzed to verify the suitability of the new enzymatic nat test . _PROTEIN_ of catalytic subunit of the nata and the candidate nat resulted in significant increase of acetylated peptides . web logos of n termini from e. coli proteins that were found to be specifically acetylated after _PROTEIN_ of or . these proteins start with the imet or were subject of imet removal . . the _PROTEIN_ of mbp also caused a significant increase in acetylation of n termini of soluble e. coli proteins . in the case of mbp specifically acetylated peptides were identified of which start with imet . the residual acetylated peptides derived from n termini that were subjected to imet removal . the web logo for these peptides demonstrate a preference of to acetylate n termini starting with a > t > s . the following residue had only minor impact on the specificity of using the here applied conditions . in order verify the identity of as a true catalytically active nat we purified the protein and confirmed its acetylase activity on protein n termini according to the here determined substrate specificity _PROTEIN_ with an accepted in vitro nat activity test . since should modify the mature n termini of the imported and plastome encoded proteins it was interesting to compare the substrate specificity of characterized in this study with acetylated protein n termini experimentally found in arabidopsis chloroplasts . remarkably accepts e. coli proteins as substrates that share the n terminal amino acid with acetylated chloroplastic proteins . this indicates that activity contributes to the multitude of n terminal acetylation events demonstrated in arabidopsis chloroplasts . comparison of substrate specificity with n termini of known acetylated _LOCATION_ localized proteins . web logo of substrate specificity for mbp is compared with experimentally identified acetylated n termini of chloroplastic stromal proteins . the proteins are either imported from the _LOCATION_ or translated in the chloroplast . the red arrow indicates similarity between substrates acetylated by in e. coli and acetylated chloroplastic proteins in arabidopsis . since can acetylate the amino group of lys residues we screened for additional lys acetylated proteins after _PROTEIN_ of mbp in e. coli . no significant increase in lys acetylation was found on e. coli proteins . however three internal lysine residues of mbp were evidenced to be acetylated . in order to test the possibility of lys auto acetylation purified mbp was incubated with or without acetyl coa for different periods of time . indeed samples incubated with acetyl coa displayed an increase of acetylated lys residues as determined with a lys specific antiserum in a time dependent manner whereas no significant difference between the control sample at time and the sample treated for min without acetyl coa was observed . signals detected at time point confirm that lys residues of mbp are partly acetylated in e. coli . to independently validate the lys auto acetylation activity of purified was incorporated with acetyl coenzyme a for min . the time dependent incorporation of label into the purified proteins confirmed the determined auto kat activity by immunological detection of lys residues . possesses
