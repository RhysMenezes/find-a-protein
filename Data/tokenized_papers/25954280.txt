members of the subfamily of p type _PROTEIN_ are thought to create and _PROTEIN_ lipid asymmetry in biological _LOCATION_ by flipping specific lipids between _LOCATION_ leaflets . in arabidopsis of the aminophospholipid _PROTEIN_ family members are _PROTEIN_ in pollen . here we show that double knockout of and results in siliques with a fold reduction in seed set with a high frequency of empty seed positions near the bottom . seed set was reduced to near zero when plants were grown under a hot/cold temperature stress . reciprocal crosses indicate that the reproductive deficiencies are due to a defect related to pollen transmission . in vitro growth assays provide evidence that pollen tubes are short and slow with fold reductions in both maximal growth rate and overall length relative to wild type . outcrosses show that when pollen are in competition with wild type pollen they have a near success rate in fertilizing ovules near the bottom of the pistil consistent with pollen having short and slow growth defects . the phenotypes were rescued by the _PROTEIN_ of either an _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ fusion protein which showed localization to both the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and highly mobile endomembrane structures . a _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis of mature pollen grains revealed significant differences between and wild type both in the relative abundance of lipid classes and in the average number of double bonds present in acyl side chains . a change in the properties of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was also indicated by a fold reduction of labeling by lipophilic fm dyes relative to wild type . together these results indicate that and provide redundant activities that function to directly or indirectly change the distribution and abundance of lipids in pollen and support a model in which and are critical for pollen fitness under normal and temperature stress conditions .
among the seven alas that are most highly _PROTEIN_ in a. thaliana pollen and _PROTEIN_ are two of the most closely related and account for approximately of the ala subfamily mrna in pollen grains or growing tubes . to determine if these genes have redundant functions in pollen development we isolated the and t dna gene disruption lines from the salk collection _PROTEIN_ and crossed them to make the double knockout . the t dna insertions for both and are in the first exon and are predicted to disrupt the production of functional proteins . a pollen transmission defect was observed for double knockout combinations of and in which only one allele was segregating or . in plants allowed to self fertilize double homozygous progeny were observed at frequencies of representing a fold _PROTEIN_ from the expected . in pollen outcrosses transmission of the allele was reduced to representing a fold _PROTEIN_ from the expected . transmission of through the female gametophyte appeared normal indicating that the observed segregation distortion was the result of a pollen autonomous defect . segregation analysis shows a defect in transmission through male gametophytes carrying and mutations . wt is an abbreviation for wild type . the observed results were compared to an expected mendelian segregation . statistical significance was determined by the pearson 's chi squared test . plants heterozygous for or individually showed no evidence of a segregation distortion when allowed to self fertilize . however manual pollen outcrosses showed a fold _PROTEIN_ in transmission indicating the loss of alone can result in a detectable phenotype . a similar deficiency was not seen for . evidence that the pollen transmission defects were caused by loss of and was corroborated by rescuing mutant pollen with transgenes encoding either _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ . both transgenes were _PROTEIN_ under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter which drives a moderate level of _PROTEIN_ preferentially in pollen . the transgenes were stably _PROTEIN_ in either an or an mutant background and reciprocal crosses were done to test for an increase in the transmission efficiency of gametes harboring a transgene . both transgenes showed an expected transmission through the female confirming that only one copy of the transgene was present in the plants used in the reciprocal crosses . in contrast pollen transmission of the transgenes was increased to in the background and in the background . neither transgene showed an increased pollen transmission in wild type control plants indicating that the improved transmission in mutants was the result of rescuing the pollen defects associated with and knockouts . additional controls showed that pollen was not rescued by an empty vector or a more distantly related ala isoform _PROTEIN_ . since the transmission defect associated with the double mutant was more pronounced subsequent studies were done using . segregation analysis shows that the pollen transmission defects of and can be rescued by _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ fusion proteins . lines containing a single copy of the transgene were _PROTEIN_ through outcrosses . wt is an abbreviation for wild type and tg is an abbreviation for transgene . the observed results were compared to an expected mendelian segregation . statistical significance was determined by the pearson 's

unevenly distributed within siliques with a high frequency of empty seed positions at the bottom of the silique . seed set was restored to wild type levels in plants _PROTEIN_ a _METHOD_ or an _METHOD_ construct but not an empty vector control indicating that the phenotype was caused by loss of and . a seed set phenotype was not observed when pistils were manually fertilized with wild type

plants were allowed to self fertilize under a temperature stress that cycled between hot days and cold nights . the temperature stress caused seed set in wild type siliques to be reduced to that of unstressed whereas mutants were sterile . seed set was restored to wild type levels in plants _PROTEIN_ a _METHOD_ or an _METHOD_ construct but not an empty vector control confirming that the sensitivity to temperature stress was caused by loss of and . loss of and results in sterility under hot day/cold night temperature stress . plants were allowed to self fertilize under a temperature

and . to quantify growth defects associated with pollen in vitro growth assays were done over a h time course . after the h growth period the overall length of pollen tubes was that of wild type . the maximal growth rate of pollen tubes was also reduced to that of wild type . _PROTEIN_ of two different transgenes _METHOD_ _METHOD_ restored the growth rate and overall length of pollen tubes to nearly that of wild type . in vitro assays show pollen tubes are short with reduced rates of growth . pollen was placed on pistils either from the corresponding genotype or from surrogate _METHOD_ plants and the pistils were placed on agar solidified growth media . pollen tubes growing out of the pistils were measured over a h time course . lengths were reported for each time point as the average length of the longest pollen tubes . values and _LOCATION_ bars represent mean _PROTEIN_ for three independent experiments for all genotypes . an independent transgenic line was used for each tg experiment with each line showing similar results . to evaluate the in vivo relevance of pollen tube growth defects pollen from plants was used to fertilize wild type pistils and the resulting mature siliques were divided into three sectors of equal length . without growth defects the allele would be expected to transmit to all three sectors equally with of the total transmission in each sector . however of the pollen transmission was observed in the top sector whereas no transmission of was observed in the bottom sector . these results indicate that the competitive fitness of ala pollen relative to wild type _PROTEIN_ in the distal region of the pistil consistent with in vitro growth assays showing pollen tubes to be slow and short . the transmission of through pollen is restricted to the top of the silique . wild type and _METHOD_ pistils were fertilized with pollen and the resulting siliques were divided into three sectors of equal length top middle and bottom . the observed results are compared to an expected equal distribution of mutant alleles across all three sectors . statistical significance was determined by the pearson 's chi squared test . the potential subcellular localization of was investigated using confocal microscopy to image _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusion proteins in the pollen tubes of stable transgenic plants . the transgenes encoding both fusion proteins were shown to rescue pollen defects . in pollen tubes treated with naaz both fusion proteins showed a localization pattern consistent with a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ association although some association with endomembrane structures was also observed . in growing pollen tubes not treated with naaz the relative amount of endomembrane associated fusion protein was higher with the labeled structures engaged in cytoplasmic streaming . these localization patterns were observed for of independent transgenic lines _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ of whether _PROTEIN_ levels were high or

same exposure settings . to determine if loss of is correlated with a change in lipid composition tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was done on lipids extracted from and wild type pollen grains . the _METHOD_ analysis detected _PROTEIN_ lipids from head groups _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and quantified the double bonds within the corresponding acyl side chain . in total the abundances of distinct lipids were measured . we chose to examine pollen grains instead of growing tubes because pollen grains could be more easily harvested in sufficient quantities with the majority of cells in the same developmental and physiological state . _PROTEIN_ profiling data suggests that both and are _PROTEIN_ at similar levels in mature pollen grains and growing pollen tubes . significant differences between and wild type were observed both in the concentrations of lipid head groups and the average number of double bonds within acyl side chains . for example we observed a fold _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ concentration and a fold increase in _PROTEIN_ concentration in pollen relative to wild type . the quantification of lipid head groups and unsaturation reveals significant differences

in contrast pollen tubes failed to show any significant pm or internal staining even after m. however both wild type and pollen tubes showed similar staining when exposed to the sterol dye filipin _PROTEIN_ indicating that the change in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ that limits fm dye staining does not affect all dyes . additionally the fm dyes were able to stain _LOCATION_ throughout pollen tubes
