riboflavin serves as a precursor for flavocoenzymes and is essential for all living _METHOD_ . the two committed enzymatic steps of riboflavin biosynthesis are performed in plants by bifunctional riba enzymes comprised of _PROTEIN_ cyclohydrolase ii _PROTEIN_ and dihydroxy butanone phosphate synthase . _METHOD_ share a small riba gene family consisting of three members . a reduction of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and in _PROTEIN_ antisense lines is not complemented by the simultaneously _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the intensity of the bleaching leaf phenotype of _PROTEIN_ deficient plants correlates with the inactivation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ while no significant effects on the mrna abundance of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were observed . we examined reasons why both _METHOD_ fail to sufficiently compensate for a lack of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . all three riba _METHOD_ are shown to be translocated into chloroplasts as _METHOD_ fusion proteins . interestingly both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have amino acid exchanges in conserved peptides domains that have been found to be essential for the two enzymatic functions . in vitro activity assays of _PROTEIN_ and dhbps with all of the three purified recombinant atriba proteins and complementation of e. coli riba and ribb mutants lacking dhbps and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ respectively confirmed the loss of bifunctionality for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . phylogenetic analyses imply that the monofunctional bipartite _PROTEIN_ proteins which have lost dhbps activity evolved early in tracheophyte evolution .
to examine the metabolic impact of the three riba _METHOD_ identified in a. thaliana the relative transcript amounts of the three atriba homologs were assessed using qrt pcr analyses in different tissues and developmental stages of wild type plants . transcripts of the three riba homologs accumulate in all analyzed tissues but transcript levels were different _METHOD_ . the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ mrna exceeded the transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in all organs and developmental stages analyzed . however the widely parallel accumulation of atriba transcripts does not indicate a strong tissue specificity of gene _PROTEIN_ of single members of the atriba gene family . a strong down regulation of the _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ in the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ mutant correlated with a bleached phenotype _METHOD_ . seedlings were unable to grow photoautotrophically on soil and their growth was abandoned in sugar supplemented media after several weeks . interestingly the bleaching phenotype of the seedlings is not counterbalanced by the simultaneous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which remains at wild type levels in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . for a gradual reduction of riboflavin biosynthesis several transgenic lines with _PROTEIN_ antisense rna _PROTEIN_ under control of the camv promoter were generated _METHOD_ . riba mrna levels were determined in rosette leaves of two representative atriba antisense lines displaying different degrees of pigment deficiency . while the intensity of the phenotype in the two selected lines correlates with reduced _PROTEIN_ transcript levels _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ at levels comparable to wild type tissue _METHOD_ . hence the _PROTEIN_ of the latter _METHOD_ does not prevent the deficiency in riboflavin biosynthesis and the decline of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis was not compensated for at the transcriptional level by modified activity of the homologous genes . the phenotypic alterations of individuals with a severe phenotype including line were compared between three leaf sections . while the leaf base _METHOD_ was similar to a wild type a progressive loss of pigmentation was observed towards the leaf tip . in these leaf sections a gradual reduction of riboflavin _METHOD_ was observed . _PROTEIN_ protein levels were strongly _PROTEIN_ in leaves _METHOD_ agreeing with the observed reduction in mrna amounts . since all three atriba genes are constantly _PROTEIN_ the observed _PROTEIN_ depletion phenotype of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the antisense lines depicted in _METHOD_ could be explained by spatial separation of atriba proteins in different subcellular compartments . to address the localization of the three atriba proteins ipsort _METHOD_ targetp _METHOD_ and predotar _METHOD_ algorithm were used for targeting predictions of their subcellular localization _METHOD_ . the prediction hinted at the existence of an n terminal riba transit peptide and either a _LOCATION_ or mitochondrial localizations . we examined in situ targeting of the three riba homologs by _PROTEIN_ mediated visualization of transiently _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion proteins after transformation of nicotiana benthamiana leaves . based on predictions by targetp three different gene constructs encoding the putative transit peptides of _PROTEIN_ were fused to end of the _METHOD_ encoding sequence _METHOD_ . the co localization of chlorophyll and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ observed for all three riba _METHOD_ fusions _METHOD_ clearly demonstrates that all atriba n termini contain _LOCATION_ targeting signals . for detailed comparative characterization of atriba enzymes in vitro all three riba encoding sequences were _PROTEIN_ in e. coli . the design of the artificial riba sequences included _PROTEIN_ to e. coli codon usage and addition of an n terminal his tag _METHOD_ . all riba proteins specified by newly generated plasmid constructs lacked the plant specific n terminal sequence including the transit peptide . thus in comparison to the wild type protein precursor sequences the recombinant proteins lacked the first _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or amino acids _PROTEIN_ respectively _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . all three over produced recombinant riba proteins were purified by _METHOD_ using metal affinity chromatography . _PROTEIN_ polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified recombinant _PROTEIN_ proteins confirmed the predicted molecular weights of and kda respectively _METHOD_ . the purified atriba proteins were assayed for _PROTEIN_ and dhbps activity in vitro _METHOD_ . a _PROTEIN_ enzymatic function was clearly demonstrated for _PROTEIN_ as well as for _PROTEIN_ whereas _PROTEIN_ did not display a detectable activity _METHOD_ . a dhbps activity was determined for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . here _PROTEIN_ did not display a measurable dhbps enzymatic function _METHOD_ . taken together the data obtained from in vitro assays clearly indicate that both recombinant _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are able to carry out only one of two enzymatic activities of bifunctional riba proteins . in e. coli riba and ribb genes encode monofunctional _PROTEIN_ and dhbps enzymes respectively . corresponding e. coli mutant strains were employed to study complementation of respective enzymatic functions by _PROTEIN_ in situ and corroborate the data obtained in vitro . atriba sequences designed for _PROTEIN_ in e. coli _METHOD_ were cloned into and transformed into e. coli riba and ribb mutants respectively . the vector was also used as blank control . we assayed the growth rate of resulting e. coli transformants in minimal medium liquid cultures _METHOD_ . since riba and ribb are riboflavin auxotrophs precultures were grown in lb medium containing g/l riboflavin . at of the cells were pelleted washed and resuspended in minimal medium and grown at for h. cultures of both e. coli mutants containing plasmid reached in minimal medium a stationary phase at of approx . _METHOD_ . cultures of the riba mutant _PROTEIN_ revealed an enhanced growth rate when transformed with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ constructs while the growth rate of e. coli riba cells transformed with pacyc _PROTEIN_ did not differ from the blank control strain _METHOD_ . the culture of the dhbps deficient mutant strain ribb displayed an enhanced growth when transformed with either the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ encoding plasmid . in contrast pacyc _PROTEIN_ was not able to improve the growth rate in comparison to the empty control plasmid _METHOD_ .
