in order to identify integral proteins and peripheral proteins associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ highly purified arabidopsis _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ from green tissue were analyzed by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were isolated by aqueous two phase partitioning which yields _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ vesicles with a cytoplasmic side in orientation and with a purity of . these vesicles were turned inside out by treatment with brij to remove soluble contaminating proteins enclosed in the vesicles and to remove loosely bound contaminating proteins . in total putative _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins were identified of which are predicted to have transmembrane domains or to be glycosyl phosphatidylinositol anchored . about two thirds of the identified integral proteins have not previously been shown to be _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins . of the identified proteins could be classified according to function . major classes are proteins involved in transport signal transduction _LOCATION_ trafficking and stress responses . almost a quarter of the proteins identified in the present study are functionally unclassified and more than half of these are predicted to be integral .
by examining the _METHOD_ spectra with the mascot search algorithm arabidopsis proteins were matched in the national center for biotechnology information database . about of the proteins were identified by a single _METHOD_ spectrogram while more than half of the proteins were identified by three or more _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . in some cases the sequences of the identified peptides matched more than one isoform of a protein . thus additional _METHOD_ with sequence identity to proteins listed in supplementary table were not _PROTEIN_ as individual matches and are therefore not included in the total number of proteins identified . according to the _PROTEIN_ database which combines the results of several prediction _METHOD_ of the identified proteins have transmembrane domains . in addition two proteins lacking transmembrane domains are predicted to be glycosyl phosphatidylinositol anchored . thus in total proteins are either predicted to be integral _LOCATION_ proteins or gpi anchored . however we consider of these proteins e.g . enolase and alcohol dehydrogenase to be incorrectly predicted as transmembrane proteins and thus to be either gpi anchored or true integral _LOCATION_ proteins . table and fig . include identified proteins involved in transport signal transduction stress responses _LOCATION_ trafficking cellular organization metabolism as well as cell wall associated proteins . contaminants and putative contaminants are grouped in probable contaminants . a relatively large number of proteins could not be assigned a functional group and were therefore assembled in unclassified . _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ prepared by aqueous two phase partitioning are of high purity and consist of right side out vesicles . to reduce contamination by soluble proteins enclosed in the vesicles and by proteins only loosely attached to the _LOCATION_ the vesicles were turned inside out by treatment with brij in the presence of m kcl . yet a surprisingly large number of soluble enzymes were identified . these might in part be contaminating proteins since many of them are highly abundant as reflected by their high number of ests and might therefore be difficult to eliminate during preparation . we also identified ribosomal proteins and five translation _PROTEIN_ which probably originate from cytoskeletal bound polysomes . this class of polysomes which are attached to actin filaments were first detected in animal cells and _PROTEIN_ also in plants and may constitute as much as of total polysomes . these polysomes are attached to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ via actin filaments . by studying the overlap between proteins identified in the present study and those identified in proteomic studies of other cell compartments the purity of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fraction can be assessed . there is an overlap of proteins with the proteins identified in arabidopsis mitochondria . four of these actin h _PROTEIN_ a prohibitin and the _PROTEIN_ protein _GENE_ have predicted transmembrane domains . was also identified in the chloroplast proteome and remarkably the prohibitin isoform lacks ests . of more than identified proteins in the _LOCATION_ proteome of arabidopsis only the large subunit of rubisco and the water soluble photosystem i subunit psi e like protein overlap both of which are abundant chloroplast proteins . indeed rubisco is a common contaminant of almost any subcellular fraction obtained from green leaves . when compared to the and proteins identified in the chloroplast envelope by froehlich et al . and ferro et al . respectively proteins overlap including six integral proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and the putative photosystem i subunit iii precursor . none of these six proteins is a well established chloroplast envelope protein . indeed _PROTEIN_ is a canonical _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ aquaporin and _PROTEIN_ was recently identified in a study on _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ phosphopeptides . twenty one proteins identified in the present study overlap with the proteins recently identified by shimaoka et al . in tonoplasts obtained from arabidopsis suspension cells . of these proteins six are v _PROTEIN_ subunits four polysomal proteins and three proteins with unknown function . of the remaining eight proteins the prohibitin isoform and the mitochondrial h _PROTEIN_ chain were also identified in mitochondria . furthermore the aquaporin _PROTEIN_ and the sucrose transporter _PROTEIN_ which also overlap are generally _PROTEIN_ as _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins and enolase has been found in the cell wall in addition to the _LOCATION_ . shimaoka et al . also identified the soluble _PROTEIN_ attachment protein and the ssr signal sequence receptor both of which are involved in _LOCATION_ trafficking and thus may reside in several _LOCATION_ together with the putative leucine aminopeptidase which as yet has no clear function in the cell . in a proteomic study of the cell wall proteins were identified _PROTEIN_ . four of these pectinesterase glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase enolase and calreticulin were also found in our study . while pectinesterase is a distinct cell wall protein the identification of the three others both in the cell wall and in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ indicates that all four proteins are secreted . in _PROTEIN_ both glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase and enolase have been immunolocalized outside the cell and to the cell wall in fungi . furthermore a calreticulin in nicotiana plumbaginifolia has been immunolocalized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . thus the overlap between proteins identified by us as _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins and those identified in studies of other cellular compartments is small . we _PROTEIN_ this as an indication of a low level of contamination by other _LOCATION_ . about one third of the identified integral proteins have previously been shown or suggested to be _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins based on various criteria . in comparison with a study on phosphopeptides derived from arabidopsis _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of the identified proteins overlap . among these are four _PROTEIN_ two h _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the abc transporter _PROTEIN_ and the sugar transporter _PROTEIN_ . one third of the proteins identified by marmagne et al . as _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins were also identified in the present study . some proteins found in the study by marmagne et al . e.g . _PROTEIN_ binding proteins as well as several stress regulated proteins metabolic enzymes and unknown proteins were not found by us . in contrast few receptor like kinases were identified by marmagne et al . . since the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were isolated by aqueous two phase partitioning in both studies the observed differences probably reflect differences between arabidopsis _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of cell suspension cultures and green leaves . twelve of the integral proteins identified by us have been studied using immunolocalization or tagged fusion proteins . with the exception of the aquaporin _PROTEIN_ which was located to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the syntaxin _PROTEIN_ which was located to the _LOCATION_ the other were also located to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in these studies . interestingly the wheat homolog of _PROTEIN_ is able to complement a yeast mutant deficient in ammonium transporters which suggests that the _PROTEIN_ functions as a transporter of ammonia and that at least in yeast it is targeted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ and the other tonoplast intrinsic protein found by us _PROTEIN_ were also identified by marmagne et al . as putative _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins . strikingly no _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were identified in the proteomic study of the tonoplast by shimaoka et al . . as could be expected for the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins involved in transport such as aquaporins h _PROTEIN_ and sugar transporters comprise a large group of identified proteins . eight _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ aquaporins _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ present in arabidopsis were identified . the presence of these eight _METHOD_ correlates well with microarray _PROTEIN_ data in green leaves . recently santoni et al . identified five _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in arabidopsis root _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ by _METHOD_ . even though few _PROTEIN_ show strict organ specific _PROTEIN_ our results and the results by santoni et al . taken together point to differences in the protein _PROTEIN_ pattern . four _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ identified in the present study were not identified in roots whereas _PROTEIN_ was only identified in roots . these five _METHOD_ are thus potential organ specific aquaporins of leaves and roots respectively . at the subcellular level _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have previously been located to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ by _METHOD_ fusion proteins . four h _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and were found . only _PROTEIN_ not found by us was earlier firmly demonstrated to be present in leaf tissue with a specific localization to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of phloem companion cells . of the two disaccharide transporters _PROTEIN_ and and four monosaccharide transporters _PROTEIN_ and identified only _PROTEIN_ has not yet been functionally classified or localized . for instance _PROTEIN_ has previously been immunolocalized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of phloem companion cells in all organs . two additional transport proteins the subunit of the k channel and the ammonium transporter _PROTEIN_ have been localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ by immunogold labeling and _METHOD_ tagging respectively . some less well characterized transport proteins were also found . _PROTEIN_ is one of five arabidopsis proteins that can functionally complement saccharomyces cerevisiae high affinity copper transport mutants . the hypothetical protein _GENE_ is identical to the magnesium transporter . the like permease identified has a strong similarity to the auxin transporter _PROTEIN_ . in addition a peptide sequence that matches two _METHOD_ of lysine histidine transporters was identified . the two nodulin like proteins predicted to have and transmembrane domains respectively both contain domains with high homology to prokaryotic oxalate/formate antiporters and may thus be antiporters . considering transport proteins non canonical to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ the h _PROTEIN_ two abc transporters _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seven v _PROTEIN_ subunits and two _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were identified . h _PROTEIN_ are usually _PROTEIN_ as _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins although was also identified recently in studies of the chloroplast envelope and the mitochondrial proteomes . furthermore _METHOD_ tagged h _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was shown to be present in the _LOCATION_ apparatus and an h _PROTEIN_ has been immunogold localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of cauliflower . so far most abc transporters characterized in plants have been localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . yet _PROTEIN_ was identified recently in a proteomic study of the chloroplast envelope . no previous localization of the other abc transporter identified by us _PROTEIN_ has been reported . however by immunolocalization it has been shown that a pdr homolog in n. plumbaginifolia as well as _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis are present in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ indicating that members of both the pdr and mdr subfamilies of abc transporters may be located in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . there are several reports of the presence of animal and plant v _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ other than the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and among these the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . only one of the seven subunits identified by us is part of the _LOCATION_ spanning domain of the v _PROTEIN_ and thus has transmembrane domains . several soluble subunits were also identified in previous proteomic studies on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the chloroplast envelope . about half of the identified proteins involved in signal transduction are receptor like protein kinases _PROTEIN_ which reflects the diversity of these proteins in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in arabidopsis this gene family comprises more than genes . yet less than of these have assigned functions and none of the _PROTEIN_ identified in this report has been further studied . three calcium dependent protein kinases _PROTEIN_ and were also identified . several cdpks are known to be associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and recently _PROTEIN_ and were located to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ by _METHOD_ fusions . we believe that the cdpks found by us are good candidates for regulating _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins . recently et al . identified putative _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ phosphopeptides which illustrates the significance of kinases in the regulation of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ processes . for instance water transport by aquaporins and h pumping by the h _PROTEIN_ have been demonstrated to be regulated by phosphorylation by _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ associated protein kinases . other binding signaling proteins identified were calmodulin and two calreticulin _METHOD_ . the two identified phospholipases a phosphoinositide specific phospholipase c and a phospholipase d have both been shown to be present in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and to be _PROTEIN_ in leaves . several proteins known to be involved in _LOCATION_ trafficking between the _LOCATION_ apparatus and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were identified . syntaxins are involved in the formation of snare _PROTEIN_ complexes . three syntaxins of the subfamily _PROTEIN_ which is the group most closely related to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ associated syntaxins in yeast and mammals were identified . recently uemura et al . _METHOD_ tagged these three syntaxins and located them to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in arabidopsis cell suspension cultures whereas the fourth syntaxin found by us _PROTEIN_ was located to the _LOCATION_ in the same study . is believed to disassemble the snare complex after _LOCATION_ fusion has occurred . adp ribosylation _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a small _PROTEIN_ binding protein has also been suggested to be involved in transporting proteins to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ since mutants deficient in _PROTEIN_ do not target the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ h _PROTEIN_ correctly . the nodulin like protein is homologous to flotillin in drosophila which is involved in _LOCATION_ trafficking and targeted to caveolae enriched _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fractions . clathrin heavy and light chains are involved in endocytosis and the two putative heavy clathrin chains identified in the present study show homology to their mammalian counterparts . in mammalian cells the final scission of the clathrin coated vesicle from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ relies on dynamins through the action of their peckastrin homology domain . interestingly the dynamin identified in this study _PROTEIN_ is one of two arabidopsis dynamin homologs with a ph domain . while the function of _PROTEIN_ is still unknown the other plant ph domain containing isoform _PROTEIN_ is suggested to be involved in vesicle formation for _LOCATION_ trafficking at the trans _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . the secretory carrier _LOCATION_ protein _PROTEIN_ might also have a role in endocytosis since mammalian homologs are suggested to be involved in clathrin mediated vesicle budding from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and trans _LOCATION_ complex . prohibitins were previously thought to be exclusively located in mitochondria . however evidence for localization outside mitochondria has been reported for mammalian cells where prohibitins are suggested to associate with proteins involved in _LOCATION_ trafficking . little is known about many of the stress induced proteins identified . the ked like protein is classified by its similarity to the ked protein in nicotiana tabacum named so because it is rich in lysine glutamate and aspartate . the transcript of this gene was shown to be up regulated as an early response to wounding . the harpin induced protein _PROTEIN_ is encoded by a member of a large family of genes in arabidopsis homologous to the ndr and hin pathogen up regulated genes in tobacco . _PROTEIN_ was recently immunogold localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . two _LOCATION_ gene products were found . _LOCATION_ is an integral protein with predicted transmembrane domains but has not been further characterized . it was however identified by froehlich et al . as part of the chloroplast envelope proteome . evidence for the presence of callose synthases was found . however due to high sequence homology between different _METHOD_ the sequences of the three peptides identified could only confirm that at least two different _METHOD_ were present . several tubulins and actins were identified . in three cases however it was not possible to distinguish between _METHOD_ since the sequences of the peptides identified were identical . although no precise function of a specific arabinogalactan protein _PROTEIN_ has been established in plants they are implicated in cell to cell signaling during diverse developmental events . many are also predicted to be gpi anchored as predicted for the three _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ identified here . the root hair defective protein _PROTEIN_ which has three predicted transmembrane domains is believed to play an essential role in cell wall biosynthesis and actin organization . even though the role of spermine synthase has not been fully established in plants it _METHOD_ to have a role in cell wall expansion since the inactivation of one spermine synthase isoform _PROTEIN_ results in defects in the elongation of arabidopsis stem internodes by reducing cell expansion . surprisingly enzymes involved in primary or secondary metabolism were identified and only a few of these have transmembrane domains . even if the soluble enzymes might be contaminants some have previously been reported to be associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . however as discussed in the conclusions some of the enzymes identified are highly abundant soluble proteins and might therefore be contaminants of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ preparation . this group comprises contaminants and probable contaminants such as two putative dna binding proteins two putative transcription _PROTEIN_ four chloroplast proteins one of which is a putative integral _LOCATION_ protein and five mitochondrial proteins of which none is integral . two of the chloroplast proteins the large subunit of rubisco and the water soluble photosystem i subunit psi e like protein were identified previously in a study of the _LOCATION_ proteome and the putative photosystem i subunit iii precursor was identified in a study of the chloroplast envelope proteome . thus there is contamination by a few mitochondrial and chloroplast proteins . assessing the level of contamination by soluble _LOCATION_ proteins is more difficult . more than half of the unclassified proteins have predicted transmembrane regions and show no homology to other proteins or are homologous to other unclassified proteins . thirty two proteins previously annotated in ncbi as unknown putative or hypothetical are now shown to be _PROTEIN_ with a likely localization to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . two of the soluble proteins the hypothetical protein _GENE_ and the _PROTEIN_ protein _GENE_ have also been identified in a proteomic study of the chloroplast envelope . identification of integral _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins by _METHOD_ in combination with d gel separation has proved to be difficult . we have however by the exclusion of the isoelectric focusing step and the use of reversed phase hplc coupled directly to the _METHOD_ spectrometer _METHOD_ been able to identify a large number of integral proteins present in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in total over proteins putatively associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were identified and more than of these are predicted to be integral . some of the proteins have already been established to be present in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ by other techniques . the majority however have not previously been localized . only a few of the identified proteins are typically associated with cell compartments other than the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . whether these are contaminants of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ preparation or not can not be definitely determined before tagged fusion proteins have been made or immunogold localizations have been done . only a few obvious contaminants such as highly abundant soluble proteins like the large subunit of rubisco were found . however the use of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ vesicles treated with brij should have reduced the number of contaminating soluble proteins . importantly the aim was not only to identify integral proteins of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but also to identify true peripheral proteins . thus several interesting groups of soluble proteins such as cdpks candidates to be regulators of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins were found . concerning integral proteins there are altogether eight proteins out of over reported that could be contaminants although five of these have been reported to be true _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins in different species _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in addition _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were also identified by marmagne et al . as _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins . these seven proteins are thus listed under transport and _LOCATION_ trafficking and this leaves only the putative photosystem i subunit iii precursor as a probable contaminating integral protein . taken together this suggests a contamination by other _LOCATION_ of less than . a group of proteins that mistakenly could be interpreted as contaminants but are not are the ribosomal proteins we detect . it is well established that polysomes are linked to actin filaments which in turn are linked to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . since we wanted to include peripheral _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins in our study in addition to integral _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins the problem of distinguishing between true peripheral proteins and contaminating soluble proteins arises . notably the putative contaminating proteins are abundant soluble proteins and not integral _LOCATION_ proteins of organellar _LOCATION_ . to wash away all contaminating soluble proteins one would probably have to wash away many true peripheral proteins . however of a total of soluble proteins identified only are likely to be contaminants . this is a low level of contamination by soluble proteins . in summary only one integral _LOCATION_ protein and soluble proteins are probable contaminants . evidence of only one ion channel the subunit of the k channel was found . to identify more ion channels and other integral proteins with low copy numbers _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fractions enriched in integral proteins are probably needed . furthermore many _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins are probably only _PROTEIN_ in certain cell types at discrete developmental stages or as a response to a particular stress . this means that the large majority of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins remains to be identified . in addition the functions of many of these proteins are unknown . almost a quarter of the proteins identified in the present study are functionally unclassified and more than half of these are predicted to be integral .
arabidopsis ecotype columbia was grown on soil at with a short day light regime and relative humidity . green leaves were harvested after weeks and used for _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ isolation . about g of plant material was homogenized using a knife blender in ml of mm sucrose mm mops koh ph mm edta casein hydrolysate polyvinylpolypyrrolidone mm ascorbate mm dtt . pvpp ascorbate and dtt were added immediately before use . immediately after homogenization _METHOD_ was added to a final concentration of mm together with ml of a protease inhibitor cocktail for plant cell and tissue extracts in _METHOD_ . the homogenate was filtered through a nylon mesh and centrifuged at for min the supernatant was saved and centrifuged at for min . the resulting microsomal pellet was resuspended in ml of resuspension medium mm sucrose mm k phosphate ph mm edta mm dtt and protease inhibitor cocktail . the resuspended _LOCATION_ were added to an g phase mixture to produce a g aqueous polymer two phase system with a final composition of dextran peg mm k phosphate ph and mm kcl . _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were then purified by aqueous polymer two phase partitioning as described previously . the final upper phases were diluted at least two fold with mm sucrose mm k phosphate ph mm edta and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were pelleted by centrifugation at for h. the whole preparation procedure was performed at . the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ pellet containing mg of protein was resuspended in ml of resuspension medium and protease inhibitor cocktail and stored in liquid nitrogen until used . protein concentration was determined according to bearden with bsa as standard . the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ vesicles which are largely cytoplasmic side in were turned inside out by treatment with the detergent brij to remove soluble proteins enclosed in the vesicles as well as loosely bound contaminating proteins . this was done by mixing at room temperature stock solutions of m kcl and of brij in mm sucrose mm potassium phosphate ph with _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to give a detergent to protein ratio of and a kcl concentration of m. since this treatment also results in smaller vesicles the final centrifugation was run for h at to increase recovery which was on a protein basis . the final _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ pellet was resupended in half the original volume of resuspension medium and protease inhibitor cocktail and used for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was performed essentially according to laemmli using cm gradient separation gels . gels were run at for h at ma followed by h at ma . protein was stained with _METHOD_ brilliant blue r . the protein bands above kda that could be detected were cut out and digested with sequencing grade modified trypsin essentially according to wilm et al . . briefly the gel pieces were washed in mm bicarbonate buffer and then destained in acetonitrile . the gel pieces were then rehydrated in bicarbonate buffer and thereafter reduced and alkylated with dtt and iodoacetamide . after further treatment with acetonitrile the pieces were dried in a speed vac before being rehydrated on ice for min in trypsination buffer . the proteins were digested overnight at . peptides were extracted by incubating the gel pieces at with shaking twice in acetonitrile and once with formic acid in between . all extractions were saved and pooled and then lyophilized and redissolved in formic acid . using an ultimate nano lc system _METHOD_ peptides were first bound to a pre column desalted by washing with acetonitrile formic acid and finally loaded onto a column placed on line to the _METHOD_ and eluted with a gradient of acetonitrile for h and min at a flow rate of nl min . _METHOD_ spectra were obtained using nano electrospray ionization on an ion trap _METHOD_ spectrometer operating in a data dependent acquisition mode . using the sequest program the _METHOD_ spectra were transformed into dta files which were used to search the arabidopsis taxonomy of the national center for biotechnology information database with the mascot _METHOD_ ion search option available at http //www.matrixscience.com . the peptide _METHOD_ tolerance was set to da and the fragment _METHOD_ tolerance to da with _PROTEIN_ cysteine as a fixed modification and oxidation of methionine as a variable modification . one missed trypsin cleavage was allowed . the scoring algorithm of mascot the mowse score is probability based and combines experimentally determined _METHOD_ data with available amino acid sequence data . peptides were considered as matches either if they were classified as significant or if they showed homology and at the same time represented a protein with a theoretical molecular weight corresponding to the apparent molecular weight after _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in a few cases single _METHOD_ spectra matched more than one peptide most often due to highly homologous peptide sequences . however only _METHOD_ spectra matching one peptide were considered . to further eliminate peptides identified incorrectly _METHOD_ spectra corresponding to peptides with high homology to other sequences in the ncbi and the arabidopsis information resource databases were evaluated by manual examination of the individual spectra . the number of unique peptides found and the number of acquired _METHOD_ _METHOD_ for each protein are listed in supplementary table online . predictions of transmembrane domains were performed by _PROTEIN_ available at http //aramemnon.botanik.uni koeln.de . the basic local alignment search tool was used at the ncbi and at tair to establish sequence homologies . supplementary material mentioned in the article is available to online subscribers at the journal
