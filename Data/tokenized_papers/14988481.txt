_LOCATION_ perform multiple functions in plants and _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ is essential for biogenesis with loss of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant leading to lethality . _LOCATION_ biogenesis plays a prominent role in gametophytes yet is poorly understood . given the importance of _PROTEIN_ we asked if it contributes to _LOCATION_ biogenesis during pollen germination . to address this question it was essential to first understand the dynamics of _LOCATION_ . a tonoplast marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under a pollen specific promoter permitted the examination of _LOCATION_ morphology in germinating pollen of arabidopsis . our results demonstrate that germination involves a complex yet definable progression of _LOCATION_ biogenesis . pollen _LOCATION_ are extremely dynamic with remarkable features such as elongated _LOCATION_ and highly mobile cytoplasmic invaginations . surprisingly _PROTEIN_ did not adversely impact _LOCATION_ morphology in pollen germinated in vitro . to focus further on _PROTEIN_ in pollen reciprocal backcrosses demonstrated reduced transmission of _PROTEIN_ through male gametophytes indicating that _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ after germination . interestingly _PROTEIN_ affected the fertility of female gametophytes that undergo similarly complex _LOCATION_ biogenesis . our results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is lethal in the sporophyte but is not fully _PROTEIN_ in the gametophytes . they also point to the complexity of pollen _LOCATION_ and suggest that the mechanism of _LOCATION_ biogenesis in pollen may differ from that in other plant tissues .
to determine if _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in pollen total rna from mature pollen of arabidopsis plants was examined for the presence of _PROTEIN_ mrna using reverse transcriptase pcr . primers were designed to detect the _PROTEIN_ mrna specifically . a major gel band was obtained that corresponded to the expected length of the rt pcr product from the mature mrna . the product was confirmed by dna sequencing to correspond to the predicted region of the _PROTEIN_ mrna . for comparison a pcr product was obtained from arabidopsis genomic dna that corresponded to the expected product length that included several introns . these results indicated that _PROTEIN_ mrna and probably protein was _PROTEIN_ from the gene in mature pollen . given that _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in mature pollen a key question was whether or not the presence of the _PROTEIN_ t dna gene knockout would affect _LOCATION_ morphology in germinating pollen . to address this question the _PROTEIN_ mutant was transformed with a construct in which the tonoplast specific marker _PROTEIN_ was fused to _METHOD_ . the reporter was under the control of the pollen specific promoter which displays enhanced _PROTEIN_ in mature pollen and throughout germination . self crosses led to the identification of lines that were homozygous for both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and functional _PROTEIN_ as a control _PROTEIN_ or homozygous for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and heterozygous for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . because the homozygous defect leads to embryo lethality _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ as a heterozygote . to study the effects of _PROTEIN_ on the morphology and dynamics of _LOCATION_ the most straightforward approach was to examine pollen collected from mutant and control lines germinated in vitro . we germinated our pollen in drops directly on coated microscope slides that were then inverted . the pollen sank to the liquid air interface providing sufficient gas exchange to support germination . the germination rates were highly variable between flowers . however pollen in different stages of germination could be prepared easily for microscopy by placing a microscope coverslip over the drop . the method was useful for other reasons as well . when the _PROTEIN_ control line was viewed by lscm numerous intracellular structures were highlighted in grains and elongating pollen tubes indicating that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ reporter was _PROTEIN_ in pollen . no _METHOD_ was detected in control pollen not _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ using the same instrument settings . these results indicated that germination in hanging drops was a useful approach and that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tonoplast reporter was functioning in pollen . germinating pollen from the control line was examined to understand the basic morphology and dynamics of the tonoplast and _LOCATION_ and to serve as a baseline for comparison to pollen from the _PROTEIN_ line . because the dynamics of _LOCATION_ biogenesis in living germinating pollen are poorly characterized germination in vitro was divided for convenience into several stages as follows hydrated pollen grains early germination tubes in early growth and tubes in more advanced growth that had at least one callose plug . hydrated pollen was first examined for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ by lscm and found to have a granular appearance suggestive of the presence of dispersed _LOCATION_ . to define these structures more carefully higher resolution images were obtained . the images clearly described the vesicular morphology within the hydrated pollen grain and this was consistent with electron microscopy images of both mature and hydrated arabidopsis pollen showing the presence of small dispersed _LOCATION_ . other aspects of pollen morphology were apparent . for example sperm cells could be seen in transmitted images and dark regions presumed to be sperm cells were seen within hydrated pollen grains . the presence of chromatin within the sperm cell _LOCATION_ was confirmed by staining with the dna dye dapi and viewed in z sections along with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in figure both dispersed _LOCATION_ and two sperm cell _LOCATION_ are visible in overlays of confocal and transmitted images . in pollen at early germination somewhat larger _LOCATION_ could be detected frequently in addition to the tonoplast which had an extended or tubular morphology . this morphology was noted _PROTEIN_ in germination and along with _LOCATION_ developed presumably via the coalescence of the smaller dispersed _LOCATION_ . as germination progressed into early growth of the pollen tube numerous small _LOCATION_ could be seen in both the pollen grain and in the elongating tube again resulting in a granular appearance . in general as pollen tube growth proceeded larger _LOCATION_ were observed particularly in the pollen grain . in addition the _LOCATION_ in the tube at times appeared to be extended in appearance . this is apparent in figure . to investigate the unusual _LOCATION_ in more detail higher resolution maximum intensity images of a z series were obtained and they indicated that the _LOCATION_ assumed a tubular morphology . it has been observed generally for pollen tubes that the tip region is devoid of _LOCATION_ . this is apparent in transmitted images that lack vesicular material in this area and is further evidenced by a corresponding lack of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ at the tip . pollen at a more advanced stage of germination was characterized by the presence of a large central _LOCATION_ in the grain and more extensive vacuolation in the tube except in the region toward the tip that frequently contained dispersed or tubular _LOCATION_ presumably necessary for growth . another feature was callose plugs . the plugs formed at the base of the pollen tube and were apparent in lscm as a region devoid of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the plug was also visible in the corresponding transmitted image and an overlay image . additional callose plugs were observed at more distal regions of the pollen tube . sperm cells migrating toward the growing tip could be seen in transmitted images indicating that pollen germinated in vitro retained this function . to confirm the presence of chromatin within the sperm cell _LOCATION_ germinating pollen at a similar stage was stained with dapi and viewed in z sections along with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in figure sperm cell dna was visualized in the pollen tube . these results indicated that _LOCATION_ morphology was ordered throughout germination . germination rates were highly variable between grains however there was a general progression from dispersed _LOCATION_ in hydrated grains and tubes in early germination to more extensive _LOCATION_ in more mature pollen tubes . during this transition an unusual feature was observed the presence of tubular _LOCATION_ in early germination in regions of the pollen tube proximal to the tip . this region was presumed to be important for rapid elongation . the range of morphologies observed suggested that _LOCATION_ in germinating pollen were undergoing rapid biogenesis . having observed _LOCATION_ morphology in static images we investigated the dynamics of _LOCATION_ biogenesis during germination . pollen with tubes in early growth before callose plug formation was examined over time after h of incubation in germination medium . the morphology of the _LOCATION_ changed significantly even within h there were altered arrangements of large _LOCATION_ in the grain and smaller _LOCATION_ in the pollen tube . tubular appearing _LOCATION_ were also present . to capture these dynamics a timed series of images were produced over a period of h. several remarkable aspects of germination were captured in the movie . these included the rapid movement of large _LOCATION_ in the pollen grain with the streaming of tonoplast toward the growing tube the rapid movement of tonoplast toward and away from the region of the tube tip in a reverse fountain pattern a lack of tonoplast flow into the extreme apex of the tube the presence of sperm cell _LOCATION_ in the tube and their movement the presence of mobile strand like _LOCATION_ and the presence of unusual bright regions of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the tonoplast of large _LOCATION_ in the grain and similar bright structures within the pollen tube that were highly mobile . some of these features were apparent in a static image from the timed series . both large _LOCATION_ and tubular _LOCATION_ were present in the grain and throughout the tube respectively . a dark region near the tip corresponded to the sperm cells . as described above the tip region is mostly devoid of tonoplast and this is particularly apparent when compared with the corresponding transmitted image . these data indicated that the germinating pollen possessed _LOCATION_ that were extremely dynamic and formed structures that were unusual in morphology and _METHOD_ . the unusual bright regions in the tonoplast of large _LOCATION_ were obvious in many pollen tubes particularly in the pollen grain shown as were other bright structures that were widely distributed throughout the tube . there were several possible explanations for these regions . to determine the nature of the structures additional pollen tubes were viewed in more detail in images from a time series over a period of min . selected images showing details of interest are presented . in figure a bright _PROTEIN_ structure and a bright semicircle were captured . in progressive images the _PROTEIN_ appeared to fuse with another region of tonoplast and the semicircle folds inward forming a nearly complete circle . the nearly complete circle then reopened . similar structures formed in other regions of the pollen tube at times forming what appeared to be complete circles . similar structures also were seen in other regions of the images . the highly _METHOD_ structures described including lines arcs and circles are very similar to double tonoplast cytoplasmic invaginations into _LOCATION_ that have been described in leaves and cotyledons of arabidopsis and are termed bulbs . the complete time series over a period of min is shown as a movie in supplemental figure and demonstrates the extreme activity of _LOCATION_ and cytoplasmic invaginations in the pollen tube . an examination of pollen at different stages of germination revealed the presence of localized bright regions that were probably cytoplasmic invaginations . these results provided the reasonable explanation that the highly _METHOD_ structures were rapidly changing cytoplasmic invaginations . overall our examination of _LOCATION_ morphology in control pollen provided details of _LOCATION_ dynamics and a solid basis for comparison to pollen containing the defective _PROTEIN_ gene . to ask if _PROTEIN_ was necessary for _LOCATION_ biogenesis or pollen germination we investigated pollen from a heterozygous _PROTEIN_ line . because _PROTEIN_ is embryo lethal when homozygous pollen containing the _PROTEIN_ gene knockout could be collected only from _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ plants . one half of the pollen from heterozygotes was predicted to contain _PROTEIN_ in the haploid complement and would not _PROTEIN_ the gene . given the essential nature of _PROTEIN_ lack of _PROTEIN_ in even a proportion of the pollen would be expected to lead to a population that is distinct and defective in _LOCATION_ morphology or other aspect of germination . pollen from _PROTEIN_ plants was examined thoroughly at all stages of germination using the approaches described for the control pollen . in all four independent experiments were done totaling a minimum of pollen grains examined from _PROTEIN_ plants at all stages described for the control pollen . in addition at least freshly collected pollen grains from _PROTEIN_ plants was examined for altered _LOCATION_ morphology . overall our detailed analysis detected no defects in _LOCATION_ biogenesis in pollen from _PROTEIN_ plants compared with pollen from control plants . because in principle of pollen from _PROTEIN_ plants harbored _PROTEIN_ it was possible that the mutant pollen germinated at a lower frequency than _PROTEIN_ pollen . to address this possibility pollen from _PROTEIN_ and control plants was germinated in vitro and quantified . the frequencies for pollen germinated in liquid were statistically the same for the mutant and control . pollen from _PROTEIN_ yielded a frequency of compared with the control frequency of . we also compared the germination frequency of pollen on solid medium which resulted in a greater overall rate of germination . pollen from _PROTEIN_ yielded a frequency of compared with the control frequency of . again this indicated no statistical difference in germination frequencies . within the limits of our assays which may not detect subtle differences in germination our results indicated that _PROTEIN_ does not significantly reduce germination and supports the conclusion that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ pollen share similar _LOCATION_ morphologies . the lack of obvious defects in _LOCATION_ biogenesis in _PROTEIN_ pollen was surprising because _PROTEIN_ is essential and there are no known homologs in the arabidopsis genome . this raised the interesting question of how _LOCATION_ biogenesis occurred at all in pollen harboring the _PROTEIN_ defect . the effect of _PROTEIN_ on pollen _LOCATION_ was either too subtle to detect using our methods which was unlikely in the case of _PROTEIN_ or was at a different stage of development or fertilization . thus rather than focus further on morphology we decided to ask if _PROTEIN_ pollen was affected functionally in vivo . as a functional assay we used genetics to examine the fertility of _PROTEIN_ gametophytes . this approach was both sensitive and quantitative compared with the morphological approach . first progeny of self crosses of _PROTEIN_ plants were evaluated for transmission of the _PROTEIN_ defect . seedling dna from the progeny was examined for the presence of the _PROTEIN_ defect via pcr to detect the characterized single t dna insertion within the _PROTEIN_ gene . because _PROTEIN_ homozygous embryos did not survive the expected ratio of _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ progeny was to . the observed ratio was to . this was a highly significant result having a p value of and indicated reduced transmission of the _PROTEIN_ gene to the progeny through the male or female gametophytes or both . to determine which gametophytes were affected by _PROTEIN_ reciprocal backcrosses were done between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants and the progeny were scored by pcr . in these crosses the expected ratio of _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ progeny was to . when the pollen donor was _PROTEIN_ the observed ratio was to which was highly significant by test having a p value of . this strongly indicated that _PROTEIN_ transmission was suppressed in male gametophytes . when the pollen donor was _PROTEIN_ the observed ratio of _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ progeny was only to . again this was a significant result having a p value of . interestingly this indicated that _PROTEIN_ also affected transmission through the female indicating that _PROTEIN_ is important for the function of male and female gametophytes . the results of the genetics also indicate that homozygous _PROTEIN_ is lethal at the sporophyte stage however at the haploid gametophyte stage it is not fully _PROTEIN_ . genetic analysis of _PROTEIN_ gametophytes individuals inheriting the _PROTEIN_ mutation were scored by pcr and then subjected to a test . all parameters are indicated as are the expected and observed results . p was calculated using graphpad quickcalcs . n sample size df degrees of freedom p statistical significance .
the rna from mature pollen was a generous gift from drs . mark johnson and daphne preuss _PROTEIN_ . pollen was collected from the arabidopsis qrt mutant which has no detectable impact on pollen function . message specific primers were designed to complement sequences within exons and . the intervening gene sequences included exons and and introns through . a gel band of bp was obtained that corresponded to the expected length of the rt pcr product from the mature mrna minus introns through . for comparison a pcr product of bp was obtained from arabidopsis genomic dna that corresponded to the expected product length which included the introns . rt pcr was performed using the superscript ii reverse transcriptase system according to the manufacturer . genomic dna was extracted from arabidopsis columbia using the cetyl trimethylammonium bromide method . the following gene specific primers were used to amplify a region of the _PROTEIN_ gene diagnostic for either the mrna or the gene containing introns catgggatatggggaaaaa and cagatgagaaagcggaagct . the conditions for pcr were as follows for min followed by cycles of amplification . products were fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis . for construction of the promoter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the promoter was removed from pegad as an ssti/age i fragment . this was replaced by blunt end ligation with an xbai/hindiii fragment from _METHOD_ containing the promoter . the promoter was originally from the laboratory of sheila mccormick _PROTEIN_ . the resulting construct _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was transformed into argobacterium tumefaciens and introduced into plants heterozygous for _PROTEIN_ by floral dipping . the _PROTEIN_ mutant has a single t dna insertion in the _PROTEIN_ gene in arabidopsis columbia . plants harboring _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were selected on _PROTEIN_ and heterozygous _PROTEIN_ plants were identified by pcr using nptii gene specific primers to identify the t dna insertion . several resistant _PROTEIN_ plants were self crossed and progeny were analyzed for the _PROTEIN_ defect . among the genotyped progeny were plants homozygous for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and heterozygous for the _PROTEIN_ defect . one such line _PROTEIN_ was used in this study . this line will be available from the arabidopsis biological resource center . seeds from self crosses of _PROTEIN_ were sterilized in ethanol and triton x and germinated on murashige and skoog minimal organics medium then transferred to soil after the appearance of four true leaves . after about weeks one or several rosette leaves were removed for the preparation of dna using plant dnazol reagent according to the manufacturer 's instructions . the final dna product was dissolved in to of water for pcr . because homozygous _PROTEIN_ is embryo lethal it was _PROTEIN_ as a heterozygote in lgt . for all genotyping _PROTEIN_ plants were identified from those that were _PROTEIN_ by using nptii specific primers to identify the t dna insertion in _PROTEIN_ . the conditions for pcr were as follows for min to cycles of amplification . the nptii product of approximately bp was fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis . as a positive control all pcr reactions included primers to the gene for the large subunit adp glc pyrophosphorylase _PROTEIN_ which resulted in a product of approximately bp . for germination in drops in vitro pollen from _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ control plants was collected from flowers that were fully or nearly fully open with anthers that were freshly dehiscent . flowers were air dried for to h then gently dabbed onto the surface of a drop of germination medium _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_
