alternative splicing is prevalent in plants but little is known about its regulation in the context of developmental and signaling pathways . we describe here a new _PROTEIN_ that influences pre messengerrna splicing and is essential for embryonic development in arabidopsis thaliana . this _PROTEIN_ was retrieved in a genetic screen that identified mutants impaired in _PROTEIN_ of an alternatively spliced _METHOD_ reporter gene . in addition to the known spliceosomal component the screen recovered arabidopsis a previously uncharacterized evolutionarily conserved protein containing a replication termination _PROTEIN_ domain . a homozygous null mutation in is embryo lethal indicating that is an essential protein . quantitative rt pcr demonstrated that impaired _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ in and mutants is due to inefficient splicing of the _METHOD_ pre mrna . a genome wide analysis using rna sequencing indicated that of total introns are retained to a significant degree in mutants . considering these results and previous suggestions that represents an ubiquitin related domain we discuss the possible role of in ubiquitin based regulation of pre mrna splicing .
we previously used a two component transgene silencing plus silencer identify _PROTEIN_ required for rddm and transcriptional gene silencing of a _METHOD_ reporter gene under the control of an upstream enhancer active in meristem regions . forward genetic screens using this system retrieved thirteen defective in meristem silencing _METHOD_ mutants that are deficient in pol v associated components of the rddm pathway . one mutant _METHOD_ which is disabled in a putative transcription _PROTEIN_ is unique in displaying defects not only in rddm/tgs but also in plant development . to dissect the roles of _METHOD_ in rddm and development we initiated a genetic suppressor screen using a mutant harboring the _METHOD_ allele . one type of suppressor mutation anticipated in this screen restores rddm/tgs but not normal development _METHOD_ . in addition to bona fide sdr mutants displaying the expected phenotypes _METHOD_ we identified two unusual mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . although these two mutants were _METHOD_ negative and resembled phenotypically the _METHOD_ mutant the apparent silencing of the _METHOD_ reporter gene occurred without increases in dna methylation at the target enhancer . moreover subsequent genetic crosses revealed that the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations were able to impair _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in a _METHOD_ wild type background lacking the s locus and without an increase in dna methylation _PROTEIN_ . thus the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations diminish _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ reporter gene at the t locus in a manner that is independent of dna methylation the _METHOD_ mutation and the s locus that triggers rddm . using classical mapping with codominant markers we mapped the _PROTEIN_ mutation to the bottom arm of chromosome . subsequent illumina whole genome sequencing revealed a g to a nucleotide change _PROTEIN_ in the gene _GENE_ . this gene encodes a amino acid protein that contains an _PROTEIN_ domain which is defined by a _PROTEIN_ motif related to the _PROTEIN_ finger motif . was discovered in fission yeast where it is needed to stabilize a paused dna replication fork to establish imprinting at the mating type locus . although proteins are found in eukaryotes ranging from fission yeast to humans the orthologs in plants have an n terminal extension of amino acids . in contrast to the high amino acid sequence similarity in the domain among different plant species the n terminal extension is only weakly conserved at the amino acid sequence level . the _PROTEIN_ mutation results in substitution of glycine for glutamic acid at position which is located at the beginning of the conserved domain . we will refer to the _PROTEIN_ protein hereafter as and the _PROTEIN_ mutation as . to complement the mutation and test a functional requirement for the n terminal extension we generated constructs encoding ha tagged versions of full length and a truncated form lacking most of the n terminal region under the control of the endogenous promoter . these constructs were introduced into the mutant containing the t locus . as assessed by _METHOD_ protein accumulation using western blotting ha but not ha complemented the mutation and restored wild type levels of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . these results demonstrate that full length including the n terminal segment is required for correct _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . two transfer dna insertion alleles and were obtained from a public stock center . both strains harbor t dna insertions within the motif . when homozygous the putative null allele conditions defects in embryogenesis and lethality shortly after germination confirming that is an essential gene . by contrast the other two alleles and are hypomorphic and display only mild developmental phenotypes . the developmental defect in was complemented by transgene constructs encoding full length but not the truncated version lacking most of the n terminal extension . these results demonstrate that full length is essential for both normal development and for proper _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ reporter gene . although has been considered a _LOCATION_ targeted protein we found that an _METHOD_ fusion protein under the control of the native promoter accumulates predominantly in the _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ of is ubiquitous and particularly strong in developing embryos during seed maturation _METHOD_ . using classical mapping with codominant markers we mapped the _PROTEIN_ mutation to a genetic interval on the bottom arm of chromosome . subsequent illumina whole genome sequencing region revealed a g to a mutation _PROTEIN_ in the gene _GENE_ . this gene encodes the core splicing _PROTEIN_ which is one of the largest and most highly conserved proteins of the spliceosome . we will refer hereafter to _PROTEIN_ as and the _PROTEIN_ mutation as . the mutation we recovered results in the substitution of a highly conserved glycine residue at position to glutamic acid _PROTEIN_ which is in the rnase h domain of the protein . similarly to is _PROTEIN_ ubiquitously and shows particularly strong _PROTEIN_ during seed maturation _METHOD_ . homozygous null mutations result in an abnormal suspensor and embryo lethality . plants homozygous for the mutation grow and reproduce normally although they are somewhat _PROTEIN_ flowering indicating that the allele is hypomorphic . was identified in the same screen as a known splicing _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is impaired in a dna methylation independent manner in both and mutants . moreover both genes have similar _PROTEIN_ patterns and null mutations are embryo lethal . these observations suggest that and act in the same pathway prompting us to test for defects in _METHOD_ pre mrna splicing in the and mutants . we had originally predicted from the structure of the t construct that _METHOD_ transcription would initiate in the minimal promoter upstream of the _METHOD_ coding sequence . in practice however this minimal promoter does not appear to be used and we detected instead three major _METHOD_ transcripts that are likely to result from alternative splicing of a pre mrna initiating upstream in the distal enhancer region . the short transcript which results from productive splicing of a cryptic intron with noncanonical donor and acceptor sites _PROTEIN_ can be translated into _METHOD_ protein using the first methionine codon after the transcription start site . mutational analysis confirmed that the short transcript is indeed the major _METHOD_ mrna . by contrast the long unspliced transcript and the middle transcript which results from unproductive splicing of a conventional _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ intron contain a number of _PROTEIN_ after the initiating methionine and can not be translated into a functional _METHOD_ protein . consistent with a role for and in splicing the _METHOD_ pre mrna the ratio of the short translatable and long untranslatable transcripts varied in wild type and mutant plants . in _METHOD_ positive plants the short translatable transcript was prominent . by contrast in _METHOD_ negative plants the long untranslatable transcript was the predominant form . and are thus required to splice the _PROTEIN_ ac intron to generate a translatable _METHOD_ mrna . quantitative rt pcr confirmed the different ratios of short and long transcripts in wild type plants and the mutant . to determine whether mutations affect splicing of introns genome wide we performed rna seq on total rna extracted from seedlings of the t line and homozygous and mutants as well as newly germinated embryos that were either heterozygous or homozygous for the null mutation . because the _PROTEIN_ splicing defect observed for the _METHOD_ reporter gene in the and mutants was intron retention which is also the most common outcome of alternative splicing in plants we focused our analysis of the rna seq data on ir events . in and mutants and of total introns respectively displayed a significant degree of increased intron retention . both major and minor _PROTEIN_ introns were affected to a comparable degree . a overlap in ir events was observed between and using the total number of irs in as a denominator and overlap in irs was observed between mutants and using the total number of irs in as a denominator . following the definition of ir fold change in a previous publication the distributions of fold changes of significantly increased ir events follow the power law distribution which shows linear distributions in the log log scale where the maximum fold changes were and for and respectively . the median fold changes of the three samples were all above five which means that more than half of significantly increased ir events showed fold changes greater than five in each mutant . additionally > of significantly increased ir events represent introns fully covered by reads of the sample suggesting that almost all increased ir events retain full introns . our method identifies significantly increased and reduced ir events equally . however in the mutants increased irs predominate among significant ir events indicating that the mutations in and are associated with reduced splicing efficiency . table sheet gives a summary table of significantly increased ir events . several cases of ir events affecting endogenous genes in the and mutants were validated using qrt pcr . to initiate studies on proteins that may associate with in a complex we carried out affinity purification of the _METHOD_ fusion protein followed by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . this analysis revealed a number of predicted and known splicing _PROTEIN_ including as well as other proteins not directly related to splicing .

based on and introduced into the homozygous mutant in a t locus background _METHOD_ using the floral dip method . transformed seedlings were selected on solid murashige and skoog _METHOD_ medium containing mg/liter phosphinothricine _PROTEIN_ . complementation of the defect in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ by the ha tagged constructs in the mutant was assessed by western blotting using a _METHOD_ antibody in or progeny of selected lines . complementation of developmental defects conditioned by the null mutation was tested in two ways . in one approach homozygous plants containing either the ha or ha construct were crossed with plants heterozygous for the null allele . the resulting progeny were allowed to self fertilize producing progeny . normal looking seedlings were genotyped for the t dna insertion in the mutant . in a second approach _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ constructs were introduced into the heterozygous mutant using the floral dip method . plants _PROTEIN_ were allowed to self fertilize to produce progeny . normal looking progeny were genotyped for the t dna insertion in the mutant . primers used for genotyping are shown in supporting information table . in both cases successful complementation by a particular transgene construct was determined by recovery of normal looking progeny that were homozygous for the allele . _METHOD_ images of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in roots
