leucine rich repeat containing transmembrane receptor like kinases _PROTEIN_ are important components of plant signal transduction . the arabidopsis thaliana somatic embryogenesis receptor like kinase _PROTEIN_ is an lrr _PROTEIN_ proposed to participate in a signal transduction cascade involved in embryo development . by yeast two hybrid screening we identified _PROTEIN_ a homologue of the mammalian aaa _PROTEIN_ and a member of the arabidopsis family of proteins as _PROTEIN_ interactors . in vitro the _PROTEIN_ kinase domain is able to transphosphorylate and bind both _PROTEIN_ and . in yeast _PROTEIN_ interacts with and with the _PROTEIN_ phosphatase _PROTEIN_ . in plant protoplasts _PROTEIN_ interacts with .
to identify proteins that physically interact with _PROTEIN_ a yeast two hybrid cdna library from arabidopsis young silique tissue was screened with the kinase domain of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . two clones were found to contain the coding sequence for the c terminal and residues of the _PROTEIN_ protein . _PROTEIN_ is a protein of residues with a predicted molecular _METHOD_ of kda and of the three _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the most abundant one . we used ests encoding the c terminal _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ residues of _PROTEIN_ to confirm the interaction with _PROTEIN_ . all _PROTEIN_ peptides interacted with the kinase domain of _PROTEIN_ and not with _PROTEIN_ or the human lamin c protein used as negative controls . three identical clones were found to contain the complete coding sequence of a member of the arabidopsis family of proteins while a fourth clone lacks the n terminal residues and was designated . control experiments in yeast showed that interacts with _PROTEIN_ but not with _PROTEIN_ nor with the lamin c protein . we could not perform the reciprocal interaction experiment because auto activates reporter gene _PROTEIN_ when fused to lexa . this was also observed for other proteins and is probably due to the acidic nature of proteins . because activates the reporter genes in an _PROTEIN_ dependent way when fused to the dna binding domain we conclude that _PROTEIN_ does interact with in yeast . to confirm the existence of a direct interaction between _PROTEIN_ and the proteins _PROTEIN_ and we _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ kinase domain _PROTEIN_ as c terminal fusion protein with _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli followed by affinity purification on glutathione resin . because _PROTEIN_ is known to form homodimers by itself we _PROTEIN_ and affinity purified the c terminal mbp fusion proteins mbp _PROTEIN_ and mbp _PROTEIN_ . and were _PROTEIN_ as _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins but had their _PROTEIN_ tag removed after purification . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was added to amylose resin with immobilised _PROTEIN_ and tested for its ability to bind to _PROTEIN_ . binding assays were performed using phosphorylated or non phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ . bound proteins were eluted and subjected to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and western blot analysis using the _PROTEIN_ antiserum . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was phosphorylated by incubating the protein with _PROTEIN_ at phosphorylating conditions . autophosphorylation activity of the _PROTEIN_ kinase domain was verified by incubating the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein in the presence of _PROTEIN_ . figure shows that mbp _PROTEIN_ does not interact with non phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or with _PROTEIN_ . upon phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ mbp _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ do interact . mbp _PROTEIN_ interacts both with non phosphorylated and phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and not with _PROTEIN_ . upon phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ there was an increase in interaction with _PROTEIN_ . lane contains _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and free _PROTEIN_ . from these results we conclude that mbp _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ bind to the kinase domain of _PROTEIN_ . although phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ enhances the interaction it is not clear whether the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with the c terminal amino acids of _PROTEIN_ is phosphorylation dependent . the results of the protein binding assay employing immobilised _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and are shown in fig . . interacts with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but not with _PROTEIN_ alone . phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein binds more than non phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . through comparison of the band intensities on the western blot we estimated that interaction of with phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ is about fivefold higher compared to non phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ . the same experiments were repeated for . interaction between non phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and either or is observed with equal intensities . when the binding assay is performed using phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ no difference was observed in the ability to bind compared to non phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . due to the gel system we used we did not see the expected difference of kda in molecular size between and . from these results we conclude that there is a phosphorylation independent interaction between and the _PROTEIN_ kinase domain as well as a phosphorylation dependent interaction . this phosphorylation dependent interaction requires the first amino acids of the protein . _PROTEIN_ is able to transphosphorylate proteins in vitro . therefore phosphorylation assays were performed to further substantiate the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ as fusion protein with mbp but due to the size of mbp also as fusion proteins with _PROTEIN_ . to allow _PROTEIN_ to transphosphorylate _PROTEIN_ both the mbp and _PROTEIN_ derived fusion proteins were incubated with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the presence of _PROTEIN_ . the reaction was stopped by adding protein sample buffer and the samples were subjected to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and subsequent autoradiography . the phospho images in fig . show that _PROTEIN_ is able to transphosphorylate mbp and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ does not transphosphorylate _PROTEIN_ nor mbp and _PROTEIN_ is not phosphorylated in the absence of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ autophosphorylation is stronger than transphosphorylation on _PROTEIN_ . one explanation for this is the presence of multiple phosphorylation sites in the _PROTEIN_ protein in comparison to only one phosphorylation site in _PROTEIN_ . in yeast phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue in the c terminal dddlys sequence of was shown to regulate cell cycle dependent shuttling of the protein between _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm due to exposure of the n terminal _LOCATION_ localisation signals . therefore we determined which residue in _PROTEIN_ is phosphorylated by _PROTEIN_ using thr ser and tyr antibodies . thr antibodies recognised the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ peptide after phosphorylation by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ while ser and tyr antibodies did not . according to the prediction of phosphorylation sites by netphos there are two putative threonine phosphorylation sites within the c terminal amino acids of _PROTEIN_ . one of these sites is conserved amongst the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ family _PROTEIN_ but not in yeast . although _PROTEIN_ is able to phosphorylate on tyrosine residues of the common substrate myelin basic protein it clearly does not phosphorylate the tyrosine residue in the c terminal ddddlyn sequence of _PROTEIN_ . therefore we conclude that _PROTEIN_ phosphorylates _PROTEIN_ on at least one threonine residue within the c terminal amino acids which may have a comparable function as phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue at the c terminus resulting in cellular translocation of the _PROTEIN_ protein . it has been reported that some protein kinases can use a protein as substrate . therefore in order to further substantiate the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and we determined whether _PROTEIN_ is also able to transphosphorylate . figure shows that besides autophosphorylation _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ can transphosphorylate both and with comparable intensity thus phosphorylation is not restricted to the n terminal residues of . the observed phosphorylation requires the presence of _PROTEIN_ as no phosphorylation was observed after incubating or with _PROTEIN_ in the absence of _PROTEIN_ . this suggests that can be a natural substrate of _PROTEIN_ . although the biological significance of all interactions with proteins that have been detected is not known it is generally agreed that proteins have a regulatory function through protein protein interactions . therefore we determined whether binding of to the _PROTEIN_ kinase domain has an effect on phosphorylation . we compared the kinetics of phosphorylation by _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ autophosphorylation . in a standard assay with mm and ng _PROTEIN_ autophosphorylation is complete within min . thus we set the pixel intensity of the _PROTEIN_ autophosphorylation band at min at and compared the intensity of the other bands on the autoradiogram with this band . in the time interval we used is being transphosphorylated as soon as _PROTEIN_ is autophosphorylated and _PROTEIN_ autophosphorylation is not impaired by the presence of phosphorylated . we can not state with certainty whether non phosphorylated does not interfere with _PROTEIN_ autophosphorylation . however we consider this to be unlikely due to the comparable autophosphorylation kinetics of _PROTEIN_ in the presence and absence of partially phosphorylated such as present in the reaction mixture after min . like observed for _PROTEIN_ transphosphorylation is lower than _PROTEIN_ autophosphorylation . this could also be due to a lower number of target phosphorylation sites on in comparison to _PROTEIN_ . from these results we conclude that the binding of to the kinase domain of _PROTEIN_ does not affect its phosphorylation activities in vitro . in addition to _PROTEIN_ and the kinase domain of _PROTEIN_ can also bind the _PROTEIN_ . the phosphatase _PROTEIN_ was determined to physically and functionally interact with the _PROTEIN_ kinase domain as it is able to dephosphorylate phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ and actively prevents autophosphorylation of the kinase . in addition yeast two hybrid interaction tests showed that _PROTEIN_ binds to _PROTEIN_ with its kinase interaction domain _PROTEIN_ . to determine whether one or more of the _PROTEIN_ interacting proteins can also interact with each other we performed a pairwise yeast two hybrid interaction test using _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and ki _PROTEIN_ cloned in and . unfortunately not all interactions could be tested due to autoactivation of the reporter genes by ki _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and when fused to the lexa dna binding protein of . as summarised in table _PROTEIN_ appears to interact not only with _PROTEIN_ but also with itself with and with _PROTEIN_ . while _PROTEIN_ interacts with the kinase interaction domain of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ only interacts with the complete _PROTEIN_ protein . yeast _PROTEIN_ as well as arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ homohexadimerise to form a functional complex in vivo . based on our experiments we can not state whether the observed interaction between _PROTEIN_ peptides and the _PROTEIN_ receptor kinase also occurs with the entire hexameric complex . the protein was found to be constitutively _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis although _PROTEIN_ can be enhanced with cold treatment . therefore we determined the occurrence of co localisation and a molecular interaction of and _PROTEIN_ at the cellular level in cowpea mesophyll protoplasts . for this we fused the entire coding region of to the c terminus of _METHOD_ and ypf _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the entire coding region of _PROTEIN_ was fused to the n terminus of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the fusion proteins were then transiently _PROTEIN_ in cowpea protoplasts . confocal laser scanning microscopy _PROTEIN_ was used to image cells _PROTEIN_ the fusion proteins . figure shows the localisation of _METHOD_ signals for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ together with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ it has previously been shown that a _METHOD_ signal can be detected at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and to a lesser extent at endomembranes . figure c confirm the previously noted location of the _PROTEIN_ protein . for _METHOD_ _METHOD_ can be detected in the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ . _LOCATION_ localisation of _METHOD_ was confirmed by co localisation of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and dapi staining . the proteins do not contain any obvious cellular localisation signal although many differences in cellular organisation exist among the proteins . for example the arabidopsis isoform is found in the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ region and is found in the cytoplasm and in the chloroplast stroma . to examine the subcellular localisation of _PROTEIN_ in the presence of we co _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in protoplasts . the superimposed image shows co localisation of the proteins at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . no obvious difference in localisation of either protein is observed upon co _PROTEIN_ . the occurrence of a molecular interaction between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ was studied by measuring the fret between the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fluorophores . the fret occurs when the fluorophores interact based on dipole dipole interaction which is only possible at close proximity _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . in the case of fret the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ will be quenched and the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ will be increased which indicates a molecular interaction of the proteins that are fused to the fluorophores . fret was measured using fspim as a detection method . spectral images were taken from small regions of protoplasts co _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ at approximately equal _PROTEIN_ levels and _METHOD_ emission spectra were generated . as a control spectral images were taken from protoplasts _PROTEIN_ only _METHOD_ . figure shows the emission spectra of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in protoplasts . the peak at nm corresponds to _METHOD_ emission and the peak at nm to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the ratio of to nm emission intensity acts as an indicator of the extent of fret . in order to compare the different measurements the _METHOD_ emission peak at nm is normalised to . the emission intensity ratios deduced from measurements at several sites in the cell but not at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of different protoplasts co _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ is close to . this is comparable with measurements obtained from ten protoplasts only _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the emission intensity ratios obtained from measurements at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of the different protoplasts co _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ showed that there was an increase in _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in of the measurements performed with a maximum of . the fret energy transfer efficiency was calculated from the emission intensity ratios between fig . b and is roughly . these results show that at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and can interact . the interaction was confirmed using apb . apb was performed by bleaching the _METHOD_ fluorophore in a defined region . images of the protoplast were taken before and after the bleaching event . when _METHOD_ is inactivated due to bleaching the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ energy can no longer be transferred to _METHOD_ in the case of fret between _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . this will result in an increase of the nm _METHOD_ emission signal and a _PROTEIN_ of the nm _METHOD_ emission signal . when we bleached the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signal at a small portion of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ where _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ co localise an increase in _METHOD_ intensity was observed . as a control we bleached _METHOD_ at a region in the cell where the two proteins do not interact . this did not result in an increase of _METHOD_ intensity . to compare the changes in _METHOD_ intensity between fig . d the _METHOD_ counts were converted to _METHOD_ percentages . energy transfer efficiencies can be calculated based on the release of quenching of donor _METHOD_ due to fret measured by comparing the intensity of donor _METHOD_ before and after complete photobleaching of the acceptor . for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ the fret energy transfer efficiency is roughly . however the _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was not completely bleached therefore the actual energy transfer will be higher . the fret efficiency using acceptor photobleaching or fspim as a detection method is comparable . therefore we conclude that the interaction between and _PROTEIN_ as observed in yeast can also occur at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of transfected plant cells .
the duplexa yeast two hybrid system was used to screen for proteins interacting with _PROTEIN_ . an arabidopsis _LOCATION_ cdna library was prepared as a fusion to the activation domain in vector using mrna from young silique tissue . the primary library contained approximately cdna clones . the nucleotide sequence encoding the kinase domain of _PROTEIN_ was cloned into the bait vector to produce a fusion protein with lexa . repression assays indicated that the lexa _PROTEIN_ protein is transported correctly into the _LOCATION_ and autoactivation assays verified that the lexa _PROTEIN_ protein does not autonomously activate the lacz or the _PROTEIN_ reporter genes . the cdna library was transformed into yeast strain _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ containing _PROTEIN_ and the reporter plasmid . colonies were judged positive when they grew in the absence of leucine at and showed visible galactosidase activity within days . screening of approximately yeast transformants on selection plates containing mg/l xgal resulted in clones that showed galactosidase activity and leucine auxotrophy . after excluding clones with _PROTEIN_ independent activation or autoactivation of the reporter genes clones encoding putative _PROTEIN_ interacting proteins remained . interacting proteins were identified as and _PROTEIN_ . interaction tests were performed with the _PROTEIN_ kinase domain the entire mature _PROTEIN_ protein without the n terminal signal sequence _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ domain _PROTEIN_ or the non related human lamin c protein in combination with _PROTEIN_ or longer parts of _PROTEIN_ encoded by est cdna clones and obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource centre . interaction was also tested using _PROTEIN_ cloned in as prey and the est encoded peptides cloned in as bait . the yeast two hybrid system was also used to determine whether _PROTEIN_ could interact with the _PROTEIN_ interacting proteins and _PROTEIN_ . therefore pairwise interaction tests were performed using _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and ki _PROTEIN_ cloned in and . interaction was determined after incubation at for days . to _PROTEIN_ the proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and a translational fusions were made to glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ and in the case of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ also to the maltose binding protein . protein _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins and _PROTEIN_ was induced with mm isopropyl d thiogalactopyranoside . proteins were solubilised by sonification and _PROTEIN_ fused proteins were bound to glutathione sepharose beads following the manufacturer s instructions . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins were digested for h with thrombin releasing and from glutathione sepharose bound _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ proteins were eluted from the beads with mm reduced glutathione in mm tris ph and mm nacl . protein _PROTEIN_ of mbp fusion proteins and mbp was induced with mm iptg . the proteins were solubilised by sonification and bound to amylose resin . soluble mbp fusion proteins were purified from the supernatant by affinity chromatography using amylose resin chromatography according to the manufacturer s instructions . proteins were eluted from the resin with mm maltose in column buffer . all fusion proteins were dialysed against mm tris ph mm dtt and mm edta after purification . protein concentrations were determined by bradford micro assay using bsa as a standard . and _PROTEIN_ antibodies were generated by immunising rabbits with the purified full length protein without the _PROTEIN_ tag or with the purified fusion protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the rabbit serum was purified from antibodies directed against bacterial proteins by passing the serum over immobilised bacterial protein extract . for western analysis the antiserum and the _PROTEIN_ antiserum were used at a dilution . because the _PROTEIN_ antiserum was raised against the complete _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein it recognises _PROTEIN_ as well as _PROTEIN_ . the antiserum shows cross reactivity with _PROTEIN_ and an unidentified kda protein but not with _PROTEIN_ . protein binding assays were performed with phosphorylated or non phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was phosphorylated by adding _PROTEIN_ and incubated for min at in a total volume of protein binding buffer _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were bound to glutathione sepharose and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were bound to amylose resin by incubation at room temperature for min . after immobilising the proteins the glutathione sepharose beads were first blocked with skimmed milk triton x and then with bsa triton x both for min at . for the binding assays of or was added to immobilised _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and ng of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was added to immobilised _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the proteins were then incubated for h at room temperature in _PROTEIN_ . the immobilised protein complexes were washed three times with ml _PROTEIN_ . bound proteins were removed from the beads by adding _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ sample buffer to the beads and incubating at for min . the proteins were then separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and detected by western analysis . transphosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was tested by incubating ng protein in the presence of ng _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ for min at in phosphorylation buffer containing unlabelled _PROTEIN_ and bq of _PROTEIN_ in a final volume of . the reaction was stopped by adding _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ sample buffer and incubated for min at . the proteins were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . radioactivity was detected with a phosphoimager using the image quant program . _PROTEIN_ specific phosphorylation was tested by incubating the fusion proteins with _PROTEIN_ in the absence of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the cdna sequence encoding complete was amplified from the est cdna clone in plasmid with a gene specific primer on the transcription start of containing an ecori site _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and a specific primer containing a xhoi site _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the pcr fragment was digested with ecori and xhoi and cloned in the corresponding sites of vector containing the cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ gene resulting in the _METHOD_ construct . in addition the pcr fragment was also digested with ecori and bamhi and cloned in the corresponding sites of vector _METHOD_ . the resulting construct was then digested with nhei and bamhi and the yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fragment was cloned in the xbai and bamhi sites of vector resulting in the _METHOD_ construct . the _METHOD_ fusion proteins were constructed and transiently _PROTEIN_ in cowpea mesophyll protoplasts as described . the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was analysed as described previously by shah et al . . for dapi staining protoplasts were fixated for min in phosphate buffered saline with paraformaldehyde and washed three times with phosphate buffered saline . protoplasts were stained with dianidino phenylindole in vectashield antifade solution and analysed with a zeiss epi _METHOD_ microscope equipped with a ccd camera . pictures were taken with a dapi filter and a fitc filter using genus software . resonance energy transfer between the _METHOD_ labelled _PROTEIN_ and proteins was measured by _METHOD_ spectral imaging microscopy as described by shah et al . . spectral images were acquired using a oil immersion objective with a groove/mm grating on the entrance slit of the spectrograph set at a central wavelength of nm and a slit width of corresponding to in the object plane . typical exposure and ccd integration time was s. the resulting _METHOD_ spectra were corrected for background _METHOD_ and camera bias by background subtraction using an _LOCATION_ region from the same spectral image . acceptor photobleaching was performed by bleaching the _METHOD_ fluorophore in a previously defined region for s with laser power at nm . images of the protoplast were taken with a s time interval .
