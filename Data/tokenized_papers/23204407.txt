xyloglucan endohydrolase and xyloglucan endotransglucosylase _PROTEIN_ activities encoded by xyloglucan endotransglucosylase hydrolase genes are involved in cell wall extension by cutting or cutting and rejoining xyloglucan chains respectively . however the physiological significance of this biochemical activity remains incompletely understood . here we find that an _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion mutant _PROTEIN_ is more al resistant than the wild type . _PROTEIN_ is bound to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the encoding gene is _PROTEIN_ in the root elongation zone and in nascent leaves suggesting a role in cell expansion . _PROTEIN_ transcript accumulation is strongly downregulated by al treatment . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in yeast yields a protein with an in vitro xeh _PROTEIN_ activity ratio of > _PROTEIN_ accumulates significantly less al in the root apex and cell wall shows remarkably lower in vivo _PROTEIN_ action and extractable _PROTEIN_ activity has a lower xyloglucan content and exhibits slower elongation . an exogenous supply of xyloglucan significantly ameliorates al toxicity by reducing al accumulation in the roots owing to the formation of an al xyloglucan complex in the medium as verified by an obvious change in chemical shift of nmr . taken together the data indicate that _PROTEIN_ affects al sensitivity by modulating cell wall xyloglucan content and al binding capacity .
in our previous study we found that the majority of al in roots is bound to the cell wall hemicellulose and that the _PROTEIN_ of one gene _PROTEIN_ correlates with hemicellulose modification . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is suppressed by al stress together with declining arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ action as monitored by in vivo assays with a _METHOD_ acceptor substrate . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ function is required for al stress responses we characterized a t dna insertion line . the t dna is inserted into the second exon region of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts were not detected in the homozygous line indicating that the t dna insertion may lead to the loss of _PROTEIN_ function . the roots and shoots of _PROTEIN_ were shorter than those of the wild type showing that _PROTEIN_ function is required for normal growth . _PROTEIN_ growth so defined necessarily involves _PROTEIN_ cell expansion . to gain insight into the cellular basis for the shorter roots in the mutant we used propidium iodide staining to visualize the cell size . cellular shape and size were similar in the mutant and the wild type . therefore cell division paralleled cell expansion during the establishment of the short root phenotype under normal growth conditions . the findings are consistent with the conclusion that _PROTEIN_ is not essential for cell shape determination but instead may have an essential function in the regulation and/or processes of cell expansion . furthermore although the growth of wild type seedling roots was inhibited by when the seedlings were grown on agar medium containing for d no significant al dependent growth change occurred in _PROTEIN_ . strikingly al exposed _PROTEIN_ roots accumulate less than half the al that is found in wild type roots grown under similar conditions . root morin staining also showed much less al accumulation in the root tip of _PROTEIN_ than in columbia . one possibility is that _PROTEIN_ function is required for al accumulation in wild type roots and that al accumulation is required for the al dependent root growth inhibition . to confirm that the growth and al resistance phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ are caused by _PROTEIN_ loss of function we performed a complementation test by transforming the _PROTEIN_ mutant with the full length coding region of _PROTEIN_ . transgene _PROTEIN_ was confirmed by quantitative rt pcr . complemented _PROTEIN_ plants showed al sensitivity and overall growth similar to those of the wild type verifying that the reported _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotypes are the consequence of the loss of _PROTEIN_ function . we also generated transgenic lines that overexpress _PROTEIN_ in the wild type these col overexpressing lines showed no detectable phenotypic differences from the wild type in the absence or presence of al stress . in addition overexpression of _PROTEIN_ did not affect root al accumulation . one possible explanation for the lack of overt phenotypic changes due to _PROTEIN_ overexpression is that wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels are not limiting for _PROTEIN_ function and the amount of synthesized xyloglucan may be the limiting _PROTEIN_ . according to a phylogenetic analysis of the arabidopsis xth family _PROTEIN_ is classified together with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in subgroup while _PROTEIN_ to are in subgroup and _PROTEIN_ to are in subgroup . similar to other reported xth members _PROTEIN_ also contains a sequence encoding a potential signal peptide at the beginning of the first exon . the deduced _PROTEIN_ sequence also contains four cys residues in the c terminal portion of the protein that could form disulfide bridges these four cys residues are found in all known _PROTEIN_ although the position of the second cys residue varies slightly . consistent with the overall amino acid similarities between _PROTEIN_ and other xths _PROTEIN_ harbors a potential signal peptide at the n terminus . this region lacks charged amino acids and is rich in hydrophobic residues and cleavage of the potential signal sequence is predicted to occur after his . to elucidate the potential subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ we produced three different constructs fused to green _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and used these to transform onion cells . the full length _PROTEIN_ fusion protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was found around the cell periphery which was consistent with the interpretation of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization . moreover when a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized marker was coapplied during transformation _PROTEIN_ full _METHOD_ and pm rk staining patterns were indistinguishable . a similar result was obtained when only the first amino acids of _PROTEIN_ were fused to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ indicating that these n terminal amino acids are sufficient to confer _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization of _METHOD_ and therefore likely function as predicted as a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ targeted signal peptide . consistent with this conclusion the putative signal peptide is required for _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization because a truncated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein that lacks the whole putative signal peptide _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed localization similar to that of _METHOD_ alone . these results are consistent with the interpretation that _PROTEIN_ is most likely targeted to the _LOCATION_ by an n terminal signal peptide . the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ mrna was first examined with quantitative real time pcr of isolated organs . according to the rt pcr data _PROTEIN_ transcripts accumulate in the roots as well as in the leaves _METHOD_ flowers and siliques roots have the highest _PROTEIN_ whereas flowers have relatively low _PROTEIN_ . the in vivo tissue specific localization of _PROTEIN_ was further investigated with _PROTEIN_ staining . a dna fragment consisting of kb of sequences located upstream of the coding region was used to drive the _PROTEIN_ of the gus reporter gene and the construct containing the reporter fusion was introduced into arabidopsis wild type plants by transformation . gus analysis in the transgenic plants revealed that the _PROTEIN_ upstream sequences result in gus accumulation in both roots and shoots . in the roots _PROTEIN_ gus was predominantly _PROTEIN_ in the root tips including the elongation zone . in the shoots high gus activity was observed in developing young leaves whereas the activity was greatly reduced in fully expanded leaves . in our previous report a time course experiment indicated that _PROTEIN_ transcription is suppressed by al and a significant change can be detected even within min of al treatment . to investigate whether inhibition of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ correlates with the phenotype of shortened roots we conducted a dose response experiment . we found that root elongation _PROTEIN_ with increasing external al concentrations . in col relative root elongation _PROTEIN_ to and at and al respectively whereas in _PROTEIN_ it was reduced only to and by and al respectively . however _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the wild type was substantially inhibited even at an al concentration as low as . therefore _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is very responsive to al stress with significant reductions in _PROTEIN_ at al levels lower than that required for root growth inhibition . as the knockout of _PROTEIN_ results in increased al resistance and _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ by al treatment it is possible that _PROTEIN_ function impairs al resistance and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ somehow confers protection against al toxicity in plants . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ has an al sensitive promoter we examined gus activity in _PROTEIN_ gus transgenics subjected to al stress . we found that gus activity derived from the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ gus indeed _PROTEIN_ in response to al stress suggesting the existence of an al sensitive promoter . _PROTEIN_ gus activity was also reduced when the transgenics were subjected to cold or salt stress suggesting the inhibition of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is not specific to al . it is valuable to distinguish between _PROTEIN_ enzyme action occurring in vivo and enzyme activity assayed in vitro . in our previous study we demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ action was inhibited remarkably and quickly by al stress . we extended these findings in this work and found that in vivo _PROTEIN_ action using endogenous xyloglucan as donor substrate in the _PROTEIN_ mutant was sharply _PROTEIN_ under normal growth conditions suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is in some way responsible for a major proportion of the assayable _PROTEIN_ action in the root tip . furthermore the loss of _PROTEIN_ action on endogenous donor substrate that occurs in col upon al stress was not apparent in al stressed _PROTEIN_ . this lack of inhibition of _PROTEIN_ action by al in _PROTEIN_ is in accordance with the lack of inhibition of root growth by al in _PROTEIN_ . to further characterize the potential _METHOD_ that underlie the phenotypes in the _PROTEIN_ mutant we measured extractable xyloglucan degrading activity _PROTEIN_ by an in vitro assay using tamarind xyloglucan as donor and/or hydrolyzable substrate according to citation . xda is a measure of the degradation of xyloglucan by xths and/or cellulases that are present in a crude enzyme extract of the root . the values of plant extractable xda in vitro showed trends both in response to al stress and as the consequence of the loss of _PROTEIN_ function similar to the in vivo _PROTEIN_ action assay data . similarly the plant extractable _PROTEIN_ activity assayed radiochemically was significantly lower in _PROTEIN_ roots than in wild type roots . the xda assay as used in figure does not distinguish _PROTEIN_ from xeh however _PROTEIN_ is in a phylogenetic group of enzymes known or predicted to have xeh activity . to investigate the enzymological activities of _PROTEIN_ we employed the heterologous pichia pastoris _PROTEIN_ system to produce _PROTEIN_ . p. pastoris generated _PROTEIN_ exhibited slight _PROTEIN_ activity in a highly sensitive radiochemical assay that is specific for _PROTEIN_ with nonradioactive xyloglucan as donor substrate and xxlgol as acceptor . the _PROTEIN_ activity of _PROTEIN_ was fold lower than that of a crude holcus lanatus extract . to test whether _PROTEIN_ also has xeh activity we designed a new radiochemical assay for both xeh and _PROTEIN_ activities . the donor substrate was xyloglucan . xeh activity will hydrolyze this substrate at g units . if the g selected for cleavage is the one nearest the reducing end then free xxlgol will be released detectable by paper chromatography . supplementing the reaction mixture with nonradioactive xxxg is expected to have little effect on xeh activity . the release of xxlgol by _PROTEIN_ activity in the absence of xxxg on the other hand may be a rare occurrence because the only acceptor substrate available is the xyloglucan itself present at . however with the addition of xxxg _PROTEIN_ activity will operate at close to its maximum rate . in summary xeh releases xxlgol at its maximum rate in the presence and absence of xxxg whereas _PROTEIN_ is expected to release xxlgol at its maximum rate only in the presence of cold xxxg . p. pastoris produced _PROTEIN_ released of the radioactivity from xyloglucan as xxlgol in h and the addition of nonradioactive xxxg had little effect indicating the occurrence predominantly xeh activity . by contrast the slight xxlgol release by the h. lanatus enzyme was enhanced fold by supplemental xxxg and thus was predominantly due to _PROTEIN_ rather than xeh activity . the released in the absence of xxxg is an upper limit on the possible h. lanatus xeh activity because of the likelihood that h. lanatus _PROTEIN_ activity can appreciably catalyze some polysaccharide to polysaccharide transglycosylation in the absence of added xxxg . in conclusion the holcus _PROTEIN_ ratio for xeh activity is < whereas holcus _PROTEIN_ ratio for _PROTEIN_ activity is . therefore _PROTEIN_ had slight _PROTEIN_ activity in vitro but > fold greater xeh activity . in the light of the above observations it was surprising that xeh activity assayed in vitro in root extracts and with xyloglucan as the substrate was almost identical in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ . since xths are involved in hemicellulose modulation hemicellulose is the major al binding site in arabidopsis and _PROTEIN_ accumulates less al in the roots when grown on al we examined the hemicellulose content of _PROTEIN_ . total sugar residues and al content in hemicellulose was significantly lower in _PROTEIN_ . the in vitro al adsorption kinetics also showed that the root cell walls of _PROTEIN_ adsorbed significantly less al than did those of col . as xyloglucan is a major component of the cell wall hemicellulose and is the substrate for _PROTEIN_ and xeh activities we analyzed the xyloglucan content in root cell walls after xyloglucanase digestion and _PROTEIN_ assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis . the content of total xyloglucanase accessible xyloglucan repeat units was significantly reduced in _PROTEIN_ especially xxfg xlfg and xxlg . how may xyloglucan content be related to al sensitivity ? to address this question we applied xyloglucan to the culture medium of col and to our surprise xyloglucan treatment significantly alleviated al induced root inhibition . furthermore exogenous application of xyloglucan _PROTEIN_ al accumulation in the roots and cell wall and caused a _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ transcript accumulation . the role of xyloglucan in al accumulation was further verified in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant which has hardly any detectable xyloglucan . the double mutant contained lower levels of al in the root and accumulated and adsorbed less al in the root cell wall . together these data provide strong evidence that xyloglucan may be a key _PROTEIN_ affecting al sensitivity . however the question remained of whether xyloglucan could form a complex with al . to test this possibility we produced nmr spectra of without or with polysaccharides or citrate . changes in the chemical shift represent the formation of complexes between al and organic compounds in the solution . citrate is known to chelate al to form stable complexes with altered chemical shifts in nmr spectra . chemical shifts of from pure and its complexes with xyloglucan and citrate were all clearly distinct while no resonances were observed outside the chemical shift range shown demonstrating the formation of a distinct kind of complex between xyloglucan and al .
