the atypical myrosinase _PROTEIN_ is required for broad spectrum invasion resistance to filamentous plant pathogens . previous localization studies suggested _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ association with _LOCATION_ . here we show that _PROTEIN_ is a tail anchored protein with dual _LOCATION_ targeting to _LOCATION_ and mitochondria and that _PROTEIN_ has the capacity to form homo oligomer complexes . we demonstrate pathogen induced recruitment and immobilization of mitochondrial subpopulations at sites of attempted fungal invasion and show that mitochondrial arrest is accompanied by peripheral accumulation of _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ substrate production by the cytochrome monooxygenase _PROTEIN_ is localized to the surface of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ which focally reorganizes close to the immobilized mitochondria . exclusive targeting of _PROTEIN_ to the outer _LOCATION_ of mitochondria complements the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype corroborating the functional importance of the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ protein subpool for controlled local production of _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis products at subcellular plant microbe interaction domains . moreover live cell imaging shows that mitochondria arrested at these domains exhibit a pathogen induced redox imbalance which may lead to the production of intracellular signals .
we previously showed that _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ is associated with mobile subcellular compartments that focally accumulate at sites of attempted fungal invasion . it is important to note that it was necessary to insert _METHOD_ between the globular enzymatic part of the protein and its c terminal extension _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to produce a functional protein with the capacity to complement the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype and that we used endogenous regulatory sequences to control _PROTEIN_ in the stable transgenic lines in our earlier work and throughout this study . here we analyzed the subcellular behavior of functional _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in more detail . to this end we inoculated _PROTEIN_ mutant plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with bgh conidiospores and analyzed the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ by confocal laser scanning microscopy _PROTEIN_ . these analyses confirmed our earlier observations but also revealed distinct levels of _METHOD_ intensity at individual plant microbe interaction sites h postinoculation . closer examination of interaction sites at this time point showed that some sites were characterized by only a few _METHOD_ structures with comparatively low overall intensities of peripheral _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and occasional peripheral foci with elevated _METHOD_ intensity . other sites had high numbers of individual subcellular compartments that showed highly localized accumulation with intense overall _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . it is important to note that powdery mildew inoculations do not result in fully synchronized conidiospore germination and cell wall penetration attempts . thus we hypothesized that the observed differences reflect distinct stages of attempted invasion and therefore analyzed incipient penetration sites by time lapse _PROTEIN_ . indeed these experiments confirmed an increase in _METHOD_ _METHOD_ around the tips of fungal appressoria . moreover higher magnification revealed that a subpopulation of _METHOD_ tagged compartments become immobilized at bgh invasion sites whereas other compartments retained their mobility . the arrested compartments in particular developed peripheral patches of intense _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . within to min the _METHOD_ foci expand intensify and ultimately decorate the entire compartment . we frequently observed disappearance of intense _METHOD_ at _PROTEIN_ time points which may reflect a successful defense response and early termination of fungal invasion . _PROTEIN_ orthologs tend to form homo or hetero oligomers and large heteromeric protein aggregates . oligomerization and aggregate formation have been shown to control hydrolytic activity . to analyze the homomerization capacity of _PROTEIN_ we first conducted split ubiquitin yeast two hybrid assays . these experiments demonstrated that only full length _PROTEIN_ can homodimerize whereas the n terminal globular part or the c terminal extension of _PROTEIN_ alone fail to interact with full length _PROTEIN_ . to validate homomer formation of full length _PROTEIN_ in planta we performed blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with extracts of wild type _PROTEIN_ mutant and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ producing plants that were _PROTEIN_ with bgh or not . subsequent immunoblot analyses using a _PROTEIN_ specific antibody confirmed in planta formation of _PROTEIN_ homodimers in unchallenged and _PROTEIN_ wild type and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ producing plants . however these experiments neither provided evidence for larger _PROTEIN_ homo oligomers nor did they support pathogen induced homo oligomerization . it is important to note that the detection sensitivity may be limited when analyzing cell autonomous pathogen induced responses of individual arabidopsis epidermal pavement cells in crude plant leaf extracts . to increase detection sensitivity we immunoprecipitated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein complexes from extracts of control and bgh _PROTEIN_ plants using _METHOD_ trap coupled to agarose beads . immunoblot analyses with _PROTEIN_ confirmed the specific pull down of _METHOD_ fusion proteins and a pathogen induced formation of _PROTEIN_ resistant _PROTEIN_ dimers and oligomers of higher order . the unique c terminal extension of _PROTEIN_ was previously shown to be required for functionality in plant innate immunity suggesting that it may control enzymatic activity and/or subcellular localization . indeed the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ harbors a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids with a predicted helical structure which resembles classical c terminal tail anchors . tas are characterized by a single transmembrane domain which functions as a posttranslational targeting sequence and mediates insertion in intracellular _LOCATION_ thereby positioning the large n terminal protein portion toward the _LOCATION_ . to analyze whether or not the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ has ta function we generated transgenic _PROTEIN_ mutant plants that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fused to _PROTEIN_ s c terminal extension _METHOD_ under control of the native _PROTEIN_ promoter sequence . _PROTEIN_ revealed that _METHOD_ copied the subcellular localization pattern of full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and tagged the periphery of subcellular _LOCATION_ compartments that were either mobile or focally accumulating at plant microbe interaction sites . this supports the idea that the c terminus has ta function and is sufficient to determine the subcellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein . however we were unable to detect _METHOD_ typical for full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ decorating the immobilized organelle subpopulation at plant microbe interaction domains . this suggests that the n terminal globular part is required for pathogen induced protein aggregate formation and also rules out the possibility that aggregate formation and _METHOD_ are the result of unspecific _METHOD_ protein interactions . experiments in which we stably coexpressed _METHOD_ and full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ support this conclusion as we were able to detect a clear overall colocalization pattern of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ signals but only _METHOD_ signals of _METHOD_ at sites of attempted fungal invasion . to learn more about ta functionality and its contribution to subcellular protein localization behavior we generated a series of _PROTEIN_ ta deletion constructs that we used for _PROTEIN_ mutant complementation analyses and localization by _PROTEIN_ . constructs in which the last three c terminal amino acids were deleted _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ retained full complementation capacity and showed a subcellular localization pattern that was indistinguishable from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . similarly constructs missing the last four amino acids _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed a dosage dependent capacity to complement the compromised pathogen entry control phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutant background . however _PROTEIN_ utilizing the corresponding transgenic arabidopsis lines suggested a comparatively lower level of _METHOD_ intensity associated with intracellular _LOCATION_ compartments and higher _METHOD_ intensity in the _LOCATION_ . a discrete peripheral _LOCATION_ association was impossible to detect with constructs that lack the last five c terminal amino acids _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or the entire predicted c terminal tmd _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or when the positively charged amino acid lysine is exchanged with a neutral glycine residue _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . instead _PROTEIN_ shows diffuse distribution in the cytoplasm and possibly reticulate _LOCATION_ localization . these mistargeted proteins are not able to fully restore the compromised pathogen entry defense of _PROTEIN_ mutant plants underpinning the functional importance of the _LOCATION_ compartment associated _PROTEIN_ protein subpool . previous experiments in which uninfected arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were used for colocalization studies with transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ organelle markers suggested that a cellular subpool of _PROTEIN_ is associated with the periphery of _LOCATION_ . here we generated stable transgenic _PROTEIN_ mutant lines coexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ together with the peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ marker _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ targeting _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ corroborated our earlier finding that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . however we did not observe stable immobilization of _METHOD_ tagged _LOCATION_ at plant microbe interaction sites or _PROTEIN_ aggregate formation in the periphery of _METHOD_ tagged _LOCATION_ . although _PROTEIN_ time lapse experiments showed transport to interaction sites accumulation of _LOCATION_ was only transient . notably _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ aggregate formation was restricted to other smaller _LOCATION_ compartments which were immobilized in the immediate proximity of the tips of fungal appressoria . similar analyses with stable transgenic _PROTEIN_ mutant lines coexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ marker _METHOD_ _METHOD_ suggested that these organelles are mitochondria . indeed our time course analyses showed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ also resides in the periphery of mobile mitochondria that a subpopulation of mitochondria is focally positioned and locked at pathogen entry sites and that _PROTEIN_ aggregate formation occurs at these arrested mitochondria . to assess mitochondrial mobility and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ intensities in a quantitative manner we systematically analyzed eight time lapse _PROTEIN_ data sets of _PROTEIN_ mutant plants coexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ at hpi with bgh . first we generated pseudo color coded probability maps for the presence of individual mitochondria over the observation time using _METHOD_ as a mitochondrial marker with the rationale of low mobility to correlate with high probability of presence and vice versa . these analyses clearly indicated low mobility at the site of attempted fungal penetration . high values around the attempted penetration site are in agreement with visually apparent immobilization of mitochondria in the corresponding video sequences . in a separate approach we measured the average probability for the presence of individual mitochondria as a function of distance from the site of attempted invasion which confirmed high values close to the penetration site tailing off at a distance of to . we next used the same time series to quantify the average _METHOD_ intensities of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the mitochondrial marker _METHOD_ per single _LOCATION_ as a function of distance to the plant microbe interaction site . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ intensity per _LOCATION_ was consistently increased close to the penetration site in the individual time series and the corresponding average analysis . by contrast the _METHOD_ signal was relatively constant per _LOCATION_ and showed no distance related trend . together these quantitative data support the idea of _PROTEIN_ aggregate formation at arrested mitochondria close to sites of attempted powdery mildew invasion . inspection of wild type arabidopsis bgh interaction sites with transmission electron microscopy supports focal accumulation of mitochondria together with _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ stacks and secretory vesicles beneath pathogen induced cell wall appositions . moreover _PROTEIN_ with bgh _PROTEIN_ wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ alone substantiate the above findings and exclude that transgenic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or lack of _PROTEIN_ wild type protein affect the subcellular behavior of mitochondria . to verify the dual organelle localization of _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ of _LOCATION_ and the outer mitochondrial _LOCATION_ we employed a biochemical approach . to this end we isolated _LOCATION_ and mitochondria from leaves of wild type _PROTEIN_ mutant and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ producing plants using previously published methods . comparative immunoblot experiments with specific antibodies for _PROTEIN_ the peroxisomal marker protein _PROTEIN_ and the omm protein voltage _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed an enrichment of mitochondria and _LOCATION_ respectively and support in vivo targeting of _PROTEIN_ to the omm and the _LOCATION_ of _LOCATION_ . next we addressed the question of whether or not the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ subpool alone is sufficient to mediate _PROTEIN_ dependent entry control . for this purpose we looked for a plant protein ta that provides exclusive targeting to the omm which could be used to replace the promiscuous ta of _PROTEIN_ in transgenic complementation experiments . one ta that we considered likely to meet this criterion was the c terminus of arabidopsis translocase of outer mitochondrial _LOCATION_ a subunit of the mitochondrial outer _LOCATION_ import complex . indeed in transgenic plants coexpressing _METHOD_ tagged _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ markers for either mitochondria _METHOD_ or _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ we detected specific labeling of mitochondria and not of _LOCATION_ . moreover when we analyzed transgenic plants coexpressing _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ by _PROTEIN_ we observed colocalization and noticed organelle accumulation and immobilization at pathogen interaction sites and peripheral _PROTEIN_ aggregate formation as before . as a next step we made _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion constructs in which the genuine ta of _PROTEIN_ was replaced by the c terminal ta of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ analyses of nicotiana benthamiana leaf epidermal cells transiently coexpressing either _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ together with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ confirmed specific targeting of the latter to the periphery of mitochondria . finally we generated stably transformed _PROTEIN_ mutant plants producing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ under control of native regulatory sequences . subsequent bgh inoculation experiments corroborated mitochondrial recruitment to pathogen interaction sites and revealed aggregate formation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ at the periphery of immobilized mitochondria that was identical to the pattern observed for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in addition _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ complemented the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype in a dosage dependent manner and had the capacity to fully restore pathogen entry control . together our data suggest that the ta of can functionally replace the genuine ta of _PROTEIN_ and that the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ protein subpool alone is sufficient to provide _PROTEIN_ dependent penetration resistance against bgh . we also aimed to generate analogous transgenic _PROTEIN_ mutant plants producing _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ protein that is exclusively localized tovperoxisomal _LOCATION_ . to this end we used the tas of ascorbate or monodehydroascorbate _PROTEIN_ which were recently described to provide exclusive targeting to peroxisomal _LOCATION_ . however all transgenic lines generated with these two different tas showed promiscuous localization to both _LOCATION_ and mitochondria . this precluded reciprocal experiments to analyze the contribution of the peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ protein subpool to pathogen entry control directly . recent work by citation and citation showed that the cytochrome monooxygenase _PROTEIN_ is required for the pathogen induced production of substituted substrates of _PROTEIN_ and subsequent resistance to powdery mildew entry . in general metabolite production requires a highly coordinated compartmentalization of pathway enzymes in order to channel precursors to their target enzymes optimize flux efficiency and sequester pathway intermediates and products . this applies particularly to the production of toxic metabolites which are potentially harmful for the host organism as in the case of the _PROTEIN_ pathway products . to learn more about the subcellular site of _PROTEIN_ substrate production we generated transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ under the control of endogenous promoter sequences in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background . as _PROTEIN_ was predicted to contain an n terminal _LOCATION_ anchor we decided to use a c terminal _METHOD_ fusion construct _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the transgenic plants obtained show pathogen induced _PROTEIN_ of functional _PROTEIN_ as indicated by immunoblot analysis of leaf protein extracts and restoration of resistance to fungal entry . cell autonomous _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in response to pathogen attack was confirmed by _PROTEIN_ as we observed strong _METHOD_ _METHOD_ only in epidermal cells that were subject to attempted fungal invasion suggesting that the enhanced _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ detected in our immunoblot analysis results from a dramatic pathogen induced production in these individual epidermal cells . in these cells _METHOD_ _METHOD_ showed a reticulate distribution and focal accumulation pattern at plant microbe interaction sites suggesting a potential association of _PROTEIN_ with the _LOCATION_ and its recruitment to the contact zone between the plant and the invader . to test this hypothesis we generated stable transgenic _PROTEIN_ mutant plants coexpressing functional _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ together with the _LOCATION_ marker _METHOD_ hdel _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ experiments showed a clear colocalization supporting the idea that _PROTEIN_ like most other eukaryotic cytochrome monooxygenases is n terminally anchored in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ positioning its catalytic site facing the cytoplasm . further _PROTEIN_ analyses in which we analyzed pathogen _PROTEIN_ transgenic arabidopsis plants coexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ confirmed a network like _METHOD_ distribution pattern coalescing into a lamellar sheath of bright _METHOD_ _METHOD_ at sites of attempted fungal ingress . these areas of strong _METHOD_ _METHOD_ are in close proximity to the immobilized mitochondria that are characterized by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ aggregate formation . it is important to note that the dynamic cellular responses induced by microbial attack such as cytoskeletal rearrangements motor protein dependent organelle and vesicle transport as well as snare and abc transporter mediated secretion are highly energy dependent processes . thus it is possible that the recruitment of plant mitochondria to interaction sites with invading microbes may also supply _PROTEIN_ for energy dependent transport and secretion at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . moreover as the respiratory machinery is very sensitive to changing redox conditions mitochondria are also known to function as sensors for cellular functional imbalance . thus changes in the mitochondrial redox status can induce signaling events leading to direct effects on mitochondrial function and dynamics and to _PROTEIN_ in gene _PROTEIN_ via retrograde signaling between mitochondria and the _LOCATION_ . recently mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ targeted redox sensitive _METHOD_ sensors have become available for in vivo measurement of glutathione redox potential in arabidopsis by ratiometric determination of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ emission captured at to nm after excitation at versus nm . here we used these sensor lines to test whether or not barley powdery mildew attack induces oxidative perturbation in epidermal mitochondria . _PROTEIN_ time lapse scans of bgh _PROTEIN_ plants _PROTEIN_ mt _METHOD_ confirmed the dynamic movement of mitochondria in arabidopsis epidermal cells and the clustered immobilization of individual mitochondria at sites of attempted fungal penetration . next we determined the thiol redox status of individual mitochondria in attacked and directly adjacent epidermal cells dependent on their distance from the fungal entry site using quantitative redox imaging software recently developed by citation . these analyses demonstrated that mitochondria within of the infection site show significantly increased sensor oxidation than the rest of the mitochondrial population . interestingly there also appears to be a trend toward slightly higher levels of oxidation in mitochondria of uninfected cells that are close to the interaction site . together these data corroborate the idea that pathogen attack induces the formation of distinct mitochondrial subpopulations within single epidermal cells . moreover the thiol redox status of individual mitochondria changes as a function of distance from the actual site of fungal invasion . consequently mitochondria that are subject to immobilization at sites of attempted fungal ingress are characterized by a significantly higher sensor oxidation . this reflects an imbalance in the _PROTEIN_ thiol redox homeostasis as a likely consequence of localized release of oxidizing molecules such as hydrogen peroxide .

intensities . in parallel the bright field transmission image was processed to highlight cell boundaries and calculate the distance from the attempted penetration site . mitochondrial distribution patterns and physiological responses were typically averaged over concentric annuli from the penetration site . to estimate the degree of mitochondrial immobilization in the vicinity of the penetration site the probability of finding a _LOCATION_ at each pixel was calculated for each pixel in each frame of a min time sequence taken at s intervals and presented as a pseudo color coded
