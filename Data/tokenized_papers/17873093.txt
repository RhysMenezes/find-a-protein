controlling microtubule dynamics and spatial organization is a fundamental requirement of eukaryotic cell function . members of the orbit/mast/clasp family of microtubule associated proteins associate with the plus ends of microtubules where they promote the addition of tubulin subunits into attached kinetochore fibers during mitosis and stabilize microtubules in the vicinity of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ during interphase . to date nothing is known about their function in plants . here we show that the arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ protein is a microtubule associated protein that is involved in both cell division and cell expansion . green _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ localizes along the full length of microtubules and shows enrichment at growing plus ends . our analysis suggests that _PROTEIN_ promotes microtubule stability . _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion mutants are hypersensitive to microtubule destabilizing drugs and exhibit more sparsely populated yet well ordered root cortical microtubule arrays . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ promotes microtubule bundles that are resistant to depolymerization with oryzalin . furthermore _PROTEIN_ mutants have aberrant microtubule preprophase bands mitotic spindles and phragmoplasts indicating a role for at _PROTEIN_ in stabilizing mitotic arrays . _PROTEIN_ plants are dwarf have significantly reduced cell numbers in the root division zone and have defects in directional cell expansion . we discuss possible _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ function in higher plants .
the single ortholog of the _PROTEIN_ family found in the arabidopsis genome _PROTEIN_ is predicted to encode a protein of amino acids with an estimated molecular _METHOD_ of kd and a pi of . like other members of this family at _PROTEIN_ is relatively large and contains an n terminal tog domain which is named after the human tumor overexpressed gene protein member of the family . at _PROTEIN_ shares identity and similarity with the human _PROTEIN_ protein and shares similar domain organization with respect to heat repeats . human _PROTEIN_ also contain a c terminal clip interacting domain _PROTEIN_ which shares identity and similarity with the c terminal region in at _PROTEIN_ . figure shows a phylogenetic tree of several tog domain containing proteins including the family and the _PROTEIN_ family proteins . at _PROTEIN_ contains exons and introns spanning a bp region and yielding a bp cdna . to examine the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ rt pcr was performed using gene specific primers . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ transcripts were detected in all examined tissues . this _PROTEIN_ is consistent with database queries using genevestigator which report constitutive low level _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ at all stages of development . to determine the subcellular distribution of the _PROTEIN_ protein we engineered a reporter construct encoding the full length _PROTEIN_ coding sequence fused to the c terminus of green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . stably transformed arabidopsis plants and tobacco by suspension culture cell lines showing a wide range of reporter protein _PROTEIN_ levels were selected for analysis . this fusion protein was judged to be fully functional by its ability to rescue the _PROTEIN_ mutant . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localized to microtubules whose identity was confirmed by their disappearance upon exposure to oryzalin . furthermore treatment with latrunculin b had no appreciable effect on _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localization indicating that the observed localization did not represent actin microfilaments . plants were categorized into three groups according to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ levels and distribution patterns . in low _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plant lines _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was observed solely in leaf guard cells and exhibited a modest enrichment of _METHOD_ at the rapidly growing ends of microtubules but did not associate with microtubule ends undergoing shrinkage . these observations are consistent with its role as a _PROTEIN_ in other _METHOD_ . at moderate _PROTEIN_ levels _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was detected in all leaf epidermal cells and distributed in a nonuniform manner along the full length of microtubules with no apparent plus end enrichment . at high _PROTEIN_ levels _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ induced extensive microtubule bundling in leaf epidermal cells as judged by the increased _METHOD_ intensity and _PROTEIN_ appearance . transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaf epidermal cells also induced extensive microtubule bundling in samples showing higher levels of _PROTEIN_ . plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were treated with the microtubule depolymerizing drug oryzalin and visualized as above . in contrast with the rapid and complete loss of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labeled microtubule polymers in the low _PROTEIN_ lines with low concentrations of oryzalin the microtubule bundles observed with high _PROTEIN_ resisted depolymerization even after prolonged treatment with high concentrations of oryzalin . we also examined the distribution of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in dividing cells . none of the transgenic arabidopsis lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ showed detectable microtubule labeling in roots in which cell division was readily observable . this root specific lack of _METHOD_ has been documented for other microtubule reporter fusions including _METHOD_ tubulins and _METHOD_ but the cause is unknown . therefore we examined _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ distribution in tobacco by cells . although a range of transgene _PROTEIN_ levels were observed in different transformed lines _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was consistently low as judged by the relatively weak _METHOD_ . as shown in figure _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localized to all microtubule arrays in dividing cells . although several _PROTEIN_ orthologs have been detected at chromosomal kinetochores during prometaphase/metaphase we did not observe any detectable kinetochore localization . instead _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localized only to spindle microtubules and the surrounding cytoplasm . during anaphase _METHOD_ was concentrated in the spindle midzone appearing enriched at regions of microtubule microtubule overlap . during cytokinesis _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localized to microtubules of the phragmoplast . the distribution to all mitotic microtubule arrays supports a role in cell division for _PROTEIN_ . in order to determine the function of _PROTEIN_ in vivo t dna insertional mutants were obtained from the salk t dna insertion collection . of several insertional alleles of the _PROTEIN_ gene we obtained two separate alleles _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with insertions in exon and intron respectively . the location of both insertions was confirmed by sequencing . figure shows the positions of these insertions in the _PROTEIN_ gene . because the phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were indistinguishable _PROTEIN_ characterization only is shown in this study . loss of transcript was confirmed by rt pcr with primers downstream of the t dna insertion site . not surprisingly primers upstream of the insertion site amplified product in mutant lines although it is unknown whether truncated protein is encoded by these products . homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutants exhibited significant dwarfing at all stages of development compared with the wild type . stable _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in these lines rescued the dwarf phenotype indicating the functionality of the transgene and confirming that the phenotype was due specifically to the loss of _PROTEIN_ . in _PROTEIN_ plants the lengths of etiolated hypocotyls were significantly reduced compared with those in the wild type _PROTEIN_ as were leaf size and rosette diameter . during flowering inflorescence _METHOD_ were much shorter than those of the wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutants displayed a marked reduction in seed production as indicated by shortened siliques with fewer seeds . roots of _PROTEIN_ mutants were shorter than those in wild type seedlings . interestingly _PROTEIN_ mutants displayed a marked reduction in the length of the division zone and the elongation zone . a small but significant reduction in elongation zone width was also observed although this _PROTEIN_ was no longer apparent farther back in fully mature regions . the division zones contained fewer cells compared with the wild type with cells beginning axial expansion at a position closer to the quiescent center . however the proportion of mitotic cells within the division zone did not differ significantly from that in the wild type . in the mature region of _PROTEIN_ roots epidermal and cortical cells were significantly shorter than in the wild type although in contrast with other microtubule related mutants they did not appear swollen . given the defects in the growth of _PROTEIN_ roots we sought to determine cell production rates which reflect both the number of cells in the division zone and the rates of division of cells within that zone . cell production rates were reduced by roughly half in roots of _PROTEIN_ . this analysis suggests that the cells in _PROTEIN_ have only limited capacity for division before entering the elongation zone and that subsequent cell elongation potential is also reduced . root growth and cell size parameters in wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants we also measured cell size parameters in leaves and hypocotyls . scanning electron microscopy of d etiolated hypocotyls revealed that epidermal cells of _PROTEIN_ were shorter and wider than those of the wild type appearing more isodiametrically shaped . similarly leaf epidermal pavement cells were smaller and less interdigitated than wild type cells exhibiting a significant reduction in mean lobe length and a corresponding increase in mean neck width . these data suggest a role for _PROTEIN_ in facilitating normal cell expansion in leaves roots and hypocotyls processes that are known to require microtubules . they also suggest that _PROTEIN_ may be involved in determining cell numbers in organs given that fewer cells reside in the division zone and that cell production rates are reduced in _PROTEIN_ roots . _PROTEIN_ 's association with microtubules and the observed cell expansion defects in the _PROTEIN_ mutant prompted us to examine the organization of wild type and _PROTEIN_ interphase microtubules . figure shows typical antitubulin _METHOD_ patterns seen in wild type and _PROTEIN_ root cells . although whole mount _METHOD_ only labels microtubules in the root division zone and elongation zone this facilitates comparison of the actively growing regions of the root . in agreement with the data in figure showing a reduction in the division zone and elongation zone the region stained for microtubules in these preparations was also reduced significantly in _PROTEIN_ plants . interestingly _PROTEIN_ roots also appeared much narrower when fixed and mounted for these preparations but this was most likely due to a tendency of the wild type roots to flatten after fixation . throughout the root tip cortical microtubules were well organized and showed a predominantly transverse orientation in _PROTEIN_ plants . due to the reduction in division zone size in _PROTEIN_ and the consequent occlusion by root cap cells the random microtubule organization typical of recently divided _PROTEIN_ cells commonly seen just basal to the root cap was observed relatively infrequently . instead at the basal periphery of the root cap _PROTEIN_ epidermal cells had begun directional expansion along the organ axis and contained well ordered transverse cortical microtubules . in older more elongated cells cortical microtubules remained transverse in _PROTEIN_ as in the wild type . despite their transverse orientation _PROTEIN_ root microtubules appeared to be less abundant compared with those of the wild type particularly in the _PROTEIN_ elongation zone . we quantified this _PROTEIN_ microtubule density by measuring the distance between transversely oriented microtubules in cells of the _PROTEIN_ elongation zone . the mean distance between microtubules was for the wild type and for _PROTEIN_ . we also observed that although the overall _METHOD_ signal in wild type and _PROTEIN_ cells was similar without a postfixation detergent extraction there was a reproducible _PROTEIN_ in the antitubulin _METHOD_ signal in _PROTEIN_ plants relative to the wild type when roots were detergent extracted during processing with triton which is used to increase microtubule signal to noise by removing free soluble tubulin subunits . these data indicate that the overall tubulin concentration in cells was similar but that _PROTEIN_ cells had a _PROTEIN_ in microtubule polymer levels suggesting that microtubules are less stabilized . to further explore the role of _PROTEIN_ in microtubule stabilization plants were grown on agar plates containing the microtubule drug oryzalin and were analyzed for root swelling at various concentrations . _PROTEIN_ roots began swelling with nm oryzalin compared with nm for the wild type indicating hypersensitivity to microtubule depolymerizing drugs . together these data suggest a role for _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ microtubule polymer status in interphase cortical arrays and that a _PROTEIN_ in total tubulin polymer may affect cell expansion properties . consistent with the role that _PROTEIN_ orthologs are known to play in mitosis we observed a number of defects in microtubule organization in dividing _PROTEIN_ cells . as shown in figure the most obvious phenotype was seen in prophase cells wherein a broad preprophase band _PROTEIN_ normally _METHOD_ at the cortex surrounding the _LOCATION_ and gradually narrows as the cell approaches mitosis . in prophase cells of _PROTEIN_ cells exhibited poorly developed _PROTEIN_ with nonuniform width and microtubule density compared with in the wild type . interestingly _PROTEIN_ development appeared to lag behind the progression of the _LOCATION_ cycle as of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells contained highly condensed chromatin and lacked a nucleolus compared with in the wild type . as a result even _PROTEIN_ cells with very broad _PROTEIN_ contained _LOCATION_ with the appearance of _PROTEIN_ prophase . in addition to nonuniform and retarded _PROTEIN_ narrowing of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ formed at an angle relative to the cell axis compared with of wild type _PROTEIN_ . a number of defects were also observed in the organization of the perinuclear microtubules of prophase cells . first whereas wild type cells typically exhibit a robust prophase spindle that surrounds and _METHOD_ to the ellipsoid shape of the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ prophase spindles were often diamond shaped with deformations conforming to the indented surface of the accompanying _LOCATION_ . additionally _PROTEIN_ cells often exhibited a difference in microtubule abundance _METHOD_ between the two opposing prophase spindle poles and the position of the _LOCATION_ equator was often outside the _PROTEIN_ plane . in contrast with the severe chromosome alignment defects observed with _PROTEIN_ depletion in animal cells chromosomes in _PROTEIN_ cells aligned normally and segregated with no apparent defects during metaphase and anaphase . however _PROTEIN_ spindles exhibited a significant _PROTEIN_ in spindle length along the pole to pole axis whereas the overall morphology appeared normal . mean metaphase spindle length was for the wild type and for _PROTEIN_ . mean maximum anaphase spindle length was for the wild type and for _PROTEIN_ . a _PROTEIN_ in mean spindle width from for the wild type to for _PROTEIN_ was also seen . similarly during cytokinesis a significant _PROTEIN_ in the length of mature phragmoplasts was observed in _PROTEIN_ cells . mean phragmoplast length was for the wild type and for _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ phragmoplast morphology and orientation appeared otherwise normal . the presence of shorter spindles and phragmoplasts in _PROTEIN_ cells was consistent with observations in other _METHOD_ . together the observations reported herein of sparse interphase cortical microtubules malformed _PROTEIN_ and shorter spindles and phragmoplasts support a role for at _PROTEIN_ in promoting microtubule polymer levels and stability .
