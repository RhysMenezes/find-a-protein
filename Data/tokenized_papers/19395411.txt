in a screen for enhancers of _PROTEIN_ auxin resistance we identified two novel alleles of the putative mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase subunit iaa alanine _PROTEIN_ . in addition to enhancing the auxin response defects of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ single mutants exhibit numerous auxin related phenotypes including auxin resistant root growth and reduced _PROTEIN_ root development as well as defects in primary root growth root hair initiation and root hair elongation . remarkably all of these _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotypes were rescued when endogenous indole acetic acid levels were increased by growth at high temperature or overexpression of the _PROTEIN_ iaa biosynthetic enzyme suggesting that _PROTEIN_ mutations may alter iaa homeostasis rather than auxin response . consistent with this possibility _PROTEIN_ mutants exhibit increased aux/iaa stability compared to wild type under basal conditions but not in response to an auxin treatment . measurements of free iaa levels detected no significant difference between _PROTEIN_ and wild type controls . however we consistently observed significantly higher levels of iaa amino acid conjugates in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . furthermore using stable isotope labeled iaa precursors we observed a significant increase in the relative utilization of the trp independent iaa biosynthetic pathway in _PROTEIN_ . we therefore suggest that the auxin phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ mutants are the result of altered iaa homeostasis .
with the aim of identifying additional components of the mediated auxin response pathway we have previously performed a genetic screen to isolate enhancers of _PROTEIN_ auxin resistance . this screen identified mutations in several loci that are directly involved in the regulation of the complex including _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and . we also identified two recessive allelic mutations designated and . analysis of the progeny from columbia backcrosses revealed that single mutants were resistant to low concentrations of exogenous auxins . also consistent with reduced auxin response seedlings developed fewer _PROTEIN_ roots than the wild type on unsupplemented nutrient medium . as expected both defects were exacerbated in the _PROTEIN_ double mutants . while adult mutants look similar to wild type plants the mutant seedlings exhibit several root growth defects . in addition to reduced _PROTEIN_ root development primary roots are shorter than wild type and develop both fewer and shorter root hairs . auxin is known to control both root hair initiation and elongation . a map based cloning approach was used to isolate the gene . linkage studies placed the mutations within an approximately kb interval on chromosome . among the genes in this region was _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ encoding a putative mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase subunit . the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate and the subsequent acetylation of coenzyme a to acetyl coa . the component of the pdc catalyzes the first step of this process . in mitochondria this reaction represents the irreversible commitment of _PROTEIN_ to the tricitric acid cycle . thus _PROTEIN_ presumably encodes a subunit of an important metabolic enzyme . mutations in _PROTEIN_ were recently identified in a screen for mutants resistant to iaa ala conjugates . we therefore sequenced the _PROTEIN_ locus in both of our mutants . possesses a nonsense mutation near the end of the first exon while contains a single base pair change at the extreme end of the fifth intron _PROTEIN_ . further confirmation that the mutations are allelic with _PROTEIN_ was obtained by complementation tests with the previously described _PROTEIN_ t dna allele . we therefore renamed the and mutants as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . like the previously described _PROTEIN_ alleles _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ exhibit resistance to iaa ala in root growth assays . to examine _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ patterns we generated transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ an _PROTEIN_ promoter gus reporter construct . in agreement with publicly available microarray datasets we find that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ throughout the plant . consistent with the observed root phenotypes _PROTEIN_ is strongly _PROTEIN_ in roots with highest _PROTEIN_ detected at the root tip . auxin treatment did not appear to affect the level or pattern of _PROTEIN_ . the predicted role of _PROTEIN_ as a pdc subunit and putative mitochondrial targeting sequence suggested that _PROTEIN_ is a mitochondrial protein . to test this possibility we fused _METHOD_ to the c terminus of the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence and _PROTEIN_ this fusion protein from the _PROTEIN_ promoter . like the _PROTEIN_ gus reporter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ most strongly in roots . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ colocalized with a mitochondrial stain confirming the predicted cellular compartmentalization . no _LOCATION_ localization as it would be expected for a function in auxin signaling could be detected . the arabidopsis genome encodes three apparent pdc subunits . the previously characterized pdc subunit encoded by _GENE_ carries a _LOCATION_ signature and is identical to _PROTEIN_ on the amino acid level . _PROTEIN_ and the previously described _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ proteins display a mitochondrial targeting sequence and are identical . citation examined _PROTEIN_ mutants for phenotypes consistent with respiratory pathway defects but found no differences from wild type on media containing various concentrations of suc citrate or ethanol . these findings could be the result of functional redundancy between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ however it also raises the possibility that _PROTEIN_ has evolved an auxin specific function . citation reported that the _PROTEIN_ t dna mutant displayed wild type sensitivity to iaa ala and other auxins . in agreement with these findings we could not detect any auxin related defects in _PROTEIN_ seedlings such as we observe with _PROTEIN_ mutants . to examine the possibility that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ functionally overlap we crossed _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ . no double mutant progeny were recovered in the generation suggesting embryo and/or gametophyte lethality . furthermore when _PROTEIN_ homozygous plants were pcr genotyped for _PROTEIN_ we found that none of these plants carried the _PROTEIN_ t dna allele . in contrast we did identify _PROTEIN_ homozygotes that were heterozygous for _PROTEIN_ however no _PROTEIN_ homozygotes were detected in the progeny of these plants . we examined the embryos in the siliques of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants but observed no aborted embryos suggesting that the double mutant may be gametophyte lethal . in the populations of our backcrosses of _PROTEIN_ to col we consistently observed a modest but significant deviation from a segregation ratio suggesting reduced transmission of _PROTEIN_ gametes . this reduction in the recovery of _PROTEIN_ homozygotes was dramatically more severe in the populations of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to investigate the basis of the reduced transmission of _PROTEIN_ we conducted reciprocal crosses with _PROTEIN_ heterozygous plants . a significant reduction in transmission through the pollen was detected . we therefore considered the possibility that our failure to recover _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants might be the result of _PROTEIN_ enhancing the reduced pollen transmission phenotype of _PROTEIN_ . when _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants were reciprocally crossed with col we observed a complete lack of transmission of _PROTEIN_ through pollen . in contrast transmission rates through the female gametes were normal . to elucidate why _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen was not transmitted we used alexander 's stain to determine whether or not the pollen was viable . while pollen obtained from col _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ flowers were virtually viable only approximately of the pollen from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants was viable indicating that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is pollen lethal . inheritance of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ backgrounds while our finding that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen is inviable explained our inability to recover double mutant plants it could not account for our failure to isolate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants in the progeny of the cross between the two single mutants . we therefore considered the possibility that this genotype confers an embryo lethal phenotype . to test this possibility we used _PROTEIN_ pollen to fertilize _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ flowers . the resulting progeny should either be heterozygous for both genes or homozygous for _PROTEIN_ and heterozygous for _PROTEIN_ . however none of the progeny exhibited the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype . we then repeated this cross and examined the developing embryos within the siliques . when examined d after pollination nearly all of the embryos from _PROTEIN_ pollinated flowers were at the heart stage . in contrast when _PROTEIN_ was used as the pollen donor two distinct classes of embryos were observed with equal frequency heart stage embryos similar to the _PROTEIN_ control and small globular embryos . when examined at _PROTEIN_ stages of development the globular embryos had failed to progress indicating a developmental arrest . consistent with this possibility approximately half of the seeds obtained from the _PROTEIN_ crosses were shriveled and failed to germinate . thus in addition to an essential role in pollen development _PROTEIN_ is also essential for embryogenesis in plants with reduced dosage of _PROTEIN_ . to further characterize the auxin response of _PROTEIN_ mutants activity was examined by introducing the _PROTEIN_ gus reporter construct to examine aux/iaa protein stability . wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings containing the reporter were heat shocked to induce _PROTEIN_ of the transgene incubated at room temperature in the absence or presence of exogenous auxin and subsequently stained for gus _PROTEIN_ . to examine the basal level of the _PROTEIN_ gus fusion protein the seedlings were gus stained immediately after the heat shock period . surprisingly _PROTEIN_ seedlings exhibited dramatically higher levels of _PROTEIN_ gus staining . to better assess decay rates of the reporter protein different staining times for gus activity were subsequently used for wild type and mutant seedlings such that staining intensities at time zero were equivalent . in the absence of exogenous auxin _PROTEIN_ seedlings exhibited an obvious increase in _PROTEIN_ gus stability suggesting that activity is impaired . surprisingly however when the assay was performed in auxin supplemented medium wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings exhibited comparable _PROTEIN_ gus degradation kinetics . the finding that the _PROTEIN_ gus reporter responded normally to applied auxin in _PROTEIN_ seedlings raised the possibility that the differences we observed on unsupplemented medium may be due to a reduction in endogenous iaa levels rather than diminished function . to begin to address this possibility wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings containing the _PROTEIN_ gus reporter were grown at growth condition previously shown to increase endogenous iaa levels . when shifted to d prior to staining _PROTEIN_ seedlings exhibited no difference from wild type controls for _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ . auxin induced gene _PROTEIN_ involves the auxin dependent mediated ubiquitination of aux/iaa proteins resulting in derepression of auxin response _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ . our findings with the _PROTEIN_ gus reporter suggested that aux/iaa proteins are stabilized in _PROTEIN_ seedlings grown at on unsupplemented medium . however both exogenous auxin and increasing endogenous iaa levels by growth at high temperature restored _PROTEIN_ gus levels to that seen in wild type controls . these results are consistent with the possibility that activity per se is not affected in _PROTEIN_ but rather that auxin levels are diminished in this mutant resulting in less efficient targeting of the _PROTEIN_ gus fusion protein to the complex . to explore this possibility further we examined the effect of _PROTEIN_ mutations on auxin induced gene _PROTEIN_ using the reporter construct . when grown at _PROTEIN_ seedlings exhibit a dramatic _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ in root tips of d old seedlings . however when grown at _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ was largely restored to wild type levels . the finding that high temperature growth suppresses the defects in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ gus degradation of _PROTEIN_ mutants led us to test whether other aspects of the mutant phenotype could be suppressed by increasing endogenous iaa levels . growth at high temperature completely rescued the _PROTEIN_ defects in dichlorophenoxyacetic acid response _PROTEIN_ root development and root hair initiation and partially rescued the root hair elongation and root growth phenotypes . likewise incubation at high temperature also suppressed _PROTEIN_ as well as the _PROTEIN_ t dna allele indicating that suppression was not allele specific . to test the possibility that the effects of temperature on the _PROTEIN_ phenotypes were due to something other than elevated iaa levels we introduced the transgene into _PROTEIN_ plants . _PROTEIN_ catalyzes a rate limiting step in the trp dependent iaa biosynthetic pathway and the activation tagged transgene confers a significant increase in endogenous iaa levels compared to wild type . like the high temperature studies the transgene completely or partially rescued the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotypes . a simple explanation for the above results is that _PROTEIN_ mutations confer a reduction in free iaa levels . iaa is known to regulate seedling hypocotyl length . auxin overproducers such as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ exhibit a long hypocotyl phenotype while seedlings which contain reduced free iaa content have shorter hypocotyls than wild type . consistent with the possibility that _PROTEIN_ seedlings are iaa deficient _PROTEIN_ seedlings have significantly shorter hypocotyls than wild type . again high temperature and the transgene completely suppressed this defect . measurement of free iaa levels in whole seedlings as well as root and shoot tissues separately failed to detect a significant difference between wild type and _PROTEIN_ . to further examine possible effects of the _PROTEIN_ mutation on iaa biosynthesis we compared the utilization of trp and trp independent iaa biosynthetic pathways . wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings were fed the stable isotope labeled iaa precursors anthranilic acid and trp and the relative incorporation of these precursors into the free iaa pool was determined . in current iaa biosynthesis models anthranilic acid is believed to be upstream and trp downstream of the divergence point of the trp dependent and trp independent pathways . the ratio of the two isotopes within the free iaa pool therefore allows the relative utilization of each pathway to be assessed . compared to wild type d old seedlings the _PROTEIN_ mutant exhibited a significant increase in the utilization of the trp independent pathway demonstrating that the _PROTEIN_ mutation does alter iaa biosynthesis . lastly we also examined iaa conjugate levels in _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings . two distinct classes of iaa conjugates have been described in a variety of plant species . ester conjugates where the _PROTEIN_ group of iaa is linked to sugars or cyclic poly ols like glc and inositol and amide conjugates with amino acids or polypeptides . measurement of iaa conjugate levels in wild type and the _PROTEIN_ mutant revealed no differences in iaa ester or iaa protein conjugates . however _PROTEIN_ seedlings exhibited an approximately fold increase in iaa amino acid conjugate abundance . to examine the effects of _PROTEIN_ on specific iaa amino acid conjugates we examined levels of iaa asp and iaa glu . we detected a significant increase in iaa glu but not iaa asp levels in _PROTEIN_ seedlings suggesting some specificity in the role of _PROTEIN_ in the regulation of iaa conjugates .
all arabidopsis lines employed in this study are in the col ecotype . seedlings were grown under sterile conditions on _PROTEIN_ nutrient medium under long day lighting conditions . conditions for the mutagenesis and screen for eta mutants have been previously described . a total of auxin resistant seedlings from a cross between and landsberg _LOCATION_ were used to map the mutation using simple sequence length polymorphic markers . we initially mapped the mutation to an interval between markers and _PROTEIN_ . markers defining our final mapping interval of approximately kb were _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which amplifies and bp fragments from col and ler respectively and _PROTEIN_ which amplifies and bp products from col and ler respectively . these and additional markers are available upon request . for promotor gus studies a kb fragment containing genomic sequence from bp upstream of the _PROTEIN_ locus through the third _PROTEIN_ exon bp downstream of the _PROTEIN_ start codon was cloned in frame with the gus coding sequence of _PROTEIN_ . plants were stably transformed using agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation using standard protocols . transgenic lines were selected on _PROTEIN_ medium containing mg/l kanamycin . seedlings were stained for gus activity as previously described . the _PROTEIN_ gus transgene was crossed into the _PROTEIN_ mutant . six day old col and _PROTEIN_ seedlings homozygous for the reporter construct were heat shocked for h at to induce _PROTEIN_ of the transgene . seedlings were then stained immediately or transferred to medium for the indicated time period and stained for gus activity . naphthaleneacetic acid was added during the incubation where indicated . to account for the difference in steady state levels of the _PROTEIN_ gus protein as shown in figure and to obtain a similar staining baseline for the degradation assay col seedlings in figure were gus stained for min and _PROTEIN_ seedlings were gus stained for min respectively . col seedlings in figure were gus stained overnight and _PROTEIN_ seedlings were gus stained for min respectively . for pollen staining anthers were removed from flowers and mounted on microscope slides in one half times alexander 's solution . viable pollen grains appear dark purple whereas inviable pollen appear empty . to examine developing embryos siliques were dissected with a gauge needle cleared overnight in hoyer 's solution and visualized on a nikon diaphot inverted microscope . for subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ genomic dna was _PROTEIN_ cloned into and subsequently recombined into the binary vector according to the manufacturer 's protocols . the resulting _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct was stably transformed into col plants as described above . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic seedlings were soaked in mitotracker orange solution and _METHOD_ and mitotracker _METHOD_ examined on a bio rad mrc laser scanning confocal microscope as previously described . free iaa content was determined according to citation . to extract iaa amino acid conjugates frozen tissue samples were homogenized in isopropanol m imidazole with ng each of iaa asp and iaa glu as isotopically labeled internal standards . homogenization was performed using a mixermill with mm tungsten _PROTEIN_ beads at hz for min . the homogenized samples were allowed to equilibrate with the internal standards for h at after which they were spun at for min . supernatants were diluted with distilled water to dilute the salt concentration before solid phase extraction . samples were purified by on column purification using and solid phase extraction columns . amino columns were first conditioned using each of hexane acetonitrile distilled water and m imidazole and then twice with distilled water . the diluted supernatants were loaded on the columns and allowed to equilibrate for min before being drawn slowly through the column using vacuum . the columns were then washed with each of hexane ethyl acetate acetonitrile and methanol and the iaa amino acids were eluted times with ml formic acid . the columns were conditioned with ml each of methanol and distilled water and the total eluates were loaded on the columns and allowed to equilibrate for min before a slight vacuum was applied to draw the samples through . the columns were washed twice with distilled water and the iaa amino acids were eluted twice with methanol . to methylate the samples before gas chromatography _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis in a well ventilated hood ml ethereal diazomethane was added to each sample and they were immediately placed under a stream of and evaporated to complete dryness . the samples were brought into solution in ethyl acetate and analyzed by gas chromatography _METHOD_ using selected ion monitoring using a model network _METHOD_ equipped with an hp _METHOD_ fused silica capillary column _PROTEIN_ . the gc injector temperature was set at and temperature programmed from to at with helium as a carrier gas at a flow rate of ml/min . the quadrupole _METHOD_ was run in ei mode with an electron emission of ev . for both iaa amino acid methyl esters and their isotopically labeled standards the molecular ions and the base peaks were monitored . for me iaa asp and me iaa asp the ions were _METHOD_ to charge ratio and and m/z and respectively . for me iaa glu and me iaa glu the ions were m/z and and m/z and respectively . the iaa precursor feeding experiments were modified after citation . in brief to quantify utilization of trp dependent and trp independent iaa biosynthetic pathways seedlings were grown for d at on vertical petri dishes containing _PROTEIN_ medium . after d they were placed horizontally on a horizontal shaker at flooded with ml of stable isotope labeled trp _METHOD_ and anthranilate in mm mes and incubated for h. the seedlings were then rinsed blotted dry immediately frozen in liquid and stored at until analyzed for determination of the isotopic enrichment in the endogenous free iaa pool . extraction and analysis of free iaa was performed as described above .
