_LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ affects proteins involved in photosynthesis and translation machinery and mediates cold stress tolerance in arabidopsis .
in an effort to identify genes involved in chloroplast development and pigment synthesis we screened an _METHOD_ mutagenized population for mutants with abnormal leaf color . this screen uncovered a pale yellow inner leaf color mutant _PROTEIN_ whose phenotype was controlled by a single _LOCATION_ recessive gene . in comparison with wild type plants this mutant had pale yellow inner young leaves . the yellow color was distinct at the seedling stage and gradually became pale green during plant growth . in addition a delay of days in first true leaf emergence in the mutant plants was observed . molecular cloning of _PROTEIN_ . growth phenotype of wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants at and days old respectively . scale bars . positional cloning of _PROTEIN_ . homozygous _PROTEIN_ seedlings from a total of plants were used for fine mapping . _PROTEIN_ gene structure and the locations of the missense mutation for _PROTEIN_ and t dna insertion for . exons and introns are shown as solid boxes and lines respectively . the t dna insertion is indicated with a triangle and the single nucleotide change in _PROTEIN_ is indicated with a vertical arrow . complementation of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the _PROTEIN_ phenotype was complemented with _PROTEIN_ cdna _PROTEIN_ or genomic dna _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . plants were weeks old . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants detected by semi quantitative rt pcr and qrt pcr respectively . data represent from three biological replicates with three technical repeats . it is well established that pale green leaves are associated with impaired photosynthetic performance which subsequently affects plant growth and development . consistent with this the total chlorophyll and carotenoid levels were significantly lower in _PROTEIN_ than those in the wild type plants . the mature _PROTEIN_ mutant plants had a reduced growth rate and were much smaller than wild type plants . to isolate the gene responsible for _PROTEIN_ a map based cloning strategy was employed following the generation of an mapping population by crossing _PROTEIN_ in columbia ecotype with wild type in landsberg _LOCATION_ background . a total of homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant plants were selected and used for fine mapping . the _PROTEIN_ locus was mapped to the long arm of chromosome between bacs and using simple sequence length polymorphism markers from the tair database and arabidopsis mapping platform and further narrowed to bac clone with two co segregation markers . thirteen candidate genes between the and regions on chromosome from the _PROTEIN_ mutant were sequenced . a missense mutation was found in due to a g to a base substitution in the first exon in _PROTEIN_ resulting in an amino acid gly to glu change . encodes a rp family protein _PROTEIN_ . thus the mutant was named as _PROTEIN_ . to determine whether this missense mutation in _PROTEIN_ was responsible for the mutant phenotype of _PROTEIN_ a complementation test was performed in _PROTEIN_ using the wild type _PROTEIN_ cdna under control of the mosaic virus promoter . over positive transgenic lines overexpressing _PROTEIN_ were obtained . _PROTEIN_ restored the _PROTEIN_ mutant defects and the transgenic lines showed a completely wild type phenotype . to further validate the cloned gene we also performed a complementation test using the genomic dna fragment containing the wild type _PROTEIN_ coding region and the associated flanking sequences . the genomic dna construct was introduced into the _PROTEIN_ mutant . again the positive transgenic lines with endogenous promoter also displayed the wild type phenotype . these results indicated that _PROTEIN_ was responsible for the mutant phenotypes . to determine whether the point mutation in _PROTEIN_ affected the transcript level of _PROTEIN_ its _PROTEIN_ in week old plants was analyzed by semi quantitative rt pcr and qrt pcr . a line that carries a t dna insertion in the utr of _PROTEIN_ was also included . the mutant showed growth and developmental defects with smaller plants than _PROTEIN_ showing allele variation . interestingly the _PROTEIN_ analyses revealed that the transcript level of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in comparison with wild type plants although _PROTEIN_ was a missense mutation . missense mutations have also been reported to affect gene _PROTEIN_ in other studies . as expected the line exhibited low transcript levels . _PROTEIN_ is a component of the chloroplast ribosome small subunit . the molecular _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ mature protein was kd . a sequence similarity search showed that only one _PROTEIN_ gene orthologous to the escherichia coli protein gene existed in the arabidopsis genome . interestingly the n terminal region of _PROTEIN_ proteins was highly conserved among plants and bacterial species . the secondary structure for the n terminal sequence and a three dimensional structure model for _PROTEIN_ protein were constructed using the server . the predicted secondary structure revealed that the amino acid substitution of _PROTEIN_ from _PROTEIN_ was located in the turn element between two beta strand sheets . we also predicted the structures of _PROTEIN_ from wild type and mutant plants using the server . the same structures were observed . one explanation for this result is that the software prediction was based on published data and the mutant site might not have been analyzed . partial sequence alignment secondary structure prediction and subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ . n terminal domain sequence alignment of _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis rice maize potato tomato methanococcus vannielii chlamydia trachomatis shigella flexneri and cyanophora paradoxa . the vertical arrow indicates the mutation site . predicted secondary structure of the _PROTEIN_ n terminal domain . the vertical arrow indicates the glu substitution site in the mutant protein . wild type _PROTEIN_ and mutant _PROTEIN_ are localized in chloroplasts of week old tobacco leaves transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins . bars . _PROTEIN_ protein was predicted to be localized in chloroplasts . to validate this we investigated the subcellular location of _PROTEIN_ by transiently _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct in tobacco leaves . the fusion protein signal was monitored by confocal microscopy . merging the chlorophyll and green showed that the signals were clearly observed in chloroplasts consistent with the previous indication of a chloroplast _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ location in a chloroplast subproteome analysis . _LOCATION_ localization can be altered by single amino acid changes . we investigated whether the single amino acid substitution of _PROTEIN_ could affect the localization of _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct was infiltrated into tobacco leaves and _PROTEIN_ of the fusion protein was examined . the signal pattern of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was identical to that of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . these results showed that the _PROTEIN_ mutation did not alter the subcellular location of the protein . to investigate whether mutation in the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ would impair chloroplast rrna processing we initially examined the pattern of total rna by running denaturing agarose gels and staining them with ethidium bromide . as shown in chloroplast rrna was _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ and mutants relative to wild type plants . the reduction could be rescued by overexpressing _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . these results indicated that _PROTEIN_ had an effect on rrna processing . chloroplast rrna accumulation and processing in wild type mutant lines _PROTEIN_ and a complementation _PROTEIN_ overexpressing line _PROTEIN_ . rrna accumulation pattern in an ethidium bromide stained gel . the mutant lines had reduced levels of rrna identified based on et al . and et al . . schematic diagram of the chloroplast rrn operon in arabidopsis . the probes used for northern blot analysis are marked by black lines under the operon with asterisks . northern blot analysis of chloroplast and rrnas . total rna from week old leaves was used for northern blot experiments . equal loading controls for northern blot analysis are shown in supplementary figure . quantification of the mature bands in c using imagej . asterisks in indicate significant differences . _LOCATION_ rrnas include and which form part of the chloroplast rrn operon . these rrnas are transcribed to yield large rna precursors that are finally processed to mature rrnas by a series of processing steps . to see whether _PROTEIN_ mutation affected chloroplast rrna processing the _LOCATION_ rrna accumulation patterns were analyzed in detail by rna gel blots using gene probes . no differences in the abundance of and srna were observed between _PROTEIN_ or and wild type plants . in agreement with the results from the ethidium bromide stained denaturing agarose gels the quantity of mature rrna in the _PROTEIN_ and mutants was dramatically reduced to and respectively in comparison with the wild type control whereas the rrna precursors were increased in the mutant plants . the rrna processing deficiency in _PROTEIN_ was rescued by overexpression of _PROTEIN_ . in addition a slight increase of the and precursor rrnas was observed in the _PROTEIN_ mutants relative to wild type plants using a rrna gene specific probe . _LOCATION_ rrna was also examined . as expected similar rrna levels were observed in these mutant and wild type plants indicating that the _PROTEIN_ mutations did not affect _LOCATION_ rrna accumulation . the loading controls of rna gel blots are shown in supplementary figure . taken together these data revealed that _PROTEIN_ mutations _PROTEIN_ caused the impairment of chloroplast rrna processing . while the effects of rp defects on a number of _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ proteins have been examined previously via immunological analysis there is limited information for their global effects on protein synthesis . impaired chloroplast rrna processing can affect chloroplast translation . to obtain a global and quantitative view of proteins altered in _PROTEIN_ a comparative proteomic analysis of total proteins from week old wild type and _PROTEIN_ leaves was carried out using an itraq based method . a total of proteins were and proteins were differentially _PROTEIN_ . among the differentially _PROTEIN_ proteins proteins were up regulated with at least fold change and proteins were down regulated with or less fold change in all three biological replicates of _PROTEIN_ . consistent with the reduced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ protein level was also detected to have reduction in _PROTEIN_ compared with wild type plants . comparative proteomic analysis of the differentially _PROTEIN_ proteins in the _PROTEIN_ proteome . numbers of up and down regulated proteins showing significant differences between the wild type and _PROTEIN_ proteome . relative level of _PROTEIN_ protein in wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants . values are from three biological replicates . subcellular localization of down regulated and up regulated proteins in the _PROTEIN_ proteome . functional classification of down regulated and up regulated proteins in the _PROTEIN_ proteome . the majority of the differentially regulated proteins in either the down regulated or up regulated groups were localized to _LOCATION_ . notably among the down regulated _LOCATION_ proteins over half were _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins . in contrast a majority of up regulated _LOCATION_ proteins were stroma proteins . these differentially _PROTEIN_ proteins were categorized into functional groups using mapman . proteins associated with photosynthesis and protein synthesis represented the most abundant groups revealing that the defect in _PROTEIN_ exerted profound effects on chloroplast localized proteins involved in photosynthesis and protein synthesis . in addition to provide another approach examining the differentially _PROTEIN_ dominant proteins and validating itraq data a gel based quantitative proteomic analysis was conducted using samespots image analysis software . thirteen spots with marked differences between wild type and _PROTEIN_ were selected to identify the differentially _PROTEIN_ proteins . consistent with the itraq results seven proteins including _PROTEIN_ photosystem ii subunit r _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ subunit b _PROTEIN_ and rubisco small chain _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ whereas the other seven proteins including fructose bisphosphate aldolase _PROTEIN_ and transketolase _PROTEIN_ were increased in the mutant plants compared with wild type plants . the cross validation of these differentially _PROTEIN_ proteins by gel based proteomic analysis corroborated the itraq results and further confirmed that the amount of _PROTEIN_ protein was greatly reduced in _PROTEIN_ plants relative to wild type plants . gel based proteomic analysis of wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants . the differentially _PROTEIN_ proteins in wild type and mutant plants are labelled by black circles and the enlarged spots are indicated in red circles . spots indicate _PROTEIN_ protein . cross validation of proteins identified by itraq and gel based proteomic analyses empai ratio protein ratio calculated by exponentially modified protein abundance index sc_unnor ratio protein ratio calculated by spectrum counting_unnormalization . the protein ratio is _PROTEIN_ wild type . among the down regulated proteins numerous proteins were involved in photosynthesis . many of these photosynthetic proteins were localized in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ the site of the light dependent reactions of photosynthesis . they included six photosystem i polypeptide subunits _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ photosystem ii polypeptide subunits _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and three _PROTEIN_ synthases _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . four _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were chloroplast encoded proteins . proteins that function in the calvin cycle such as _PROTEIN_ domain containing protein and rubisco small subunit _PROTEIN_ were also dramatically reduced in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ exerts a strong effect on the photosynthetic proteins . down regulated proteins involved in photosynthesis and the chloroplast subunit the protein ratio is _PROTEIN_ wild type from itraq analysis . in addition a high proportion of the down regulated proteins were those involved in protein synthesis . eighteen rps were down regulated in the _PROTEIN_ mutant in comparison to wild type plants . most of these were involved in the chloroplast subunit which might result from _PROTEIN_ being a component of the chloroplast subunit . low _LOCATION_ rp levels could affect ribosome function and _LOCATION_ translation which are essential for plant development and photosynthesis . a total of proteins were up regulated in _PROTEIN_ of which were localized to chloroplast . among these _LOCATION_ proteins were in the _LOCATION_ stroma and _PROTEIN_ involved in protein synthesis photosynthesis and nitrogen metabolism . in addition proteins involved in nitrogen metabolism secondary metabolism one _PROTEIN_ metabolism vitamin metabolism tricarboxylic acid cycle and glycolysis were found only among the up regulated proteins . comparative proteomic analysis indicated that many proteins involved in photosynthesis were altered in _PROTEIN_ . to assess whether the _PROTEIN_ of the photosynthesis related genes was affected in the _PROTEIN_ plants the transcript levels of some _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ encoded genes involved in photosynthesis were tested by qrt pcr . the genes examined included those involved in photosystem i _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and photosystem ii _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as well as rubisco large and small subunits _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . as shown in supplementary figure no dramatic difference in _PROTEIN_ of all the tested genes was observed in _PROTEIN_ or compared with wild type plants . these data along with the proteomics studies indicate that the transcript profile of photosynthesis related genes was not disturbed in the mutant plants and that _PROTEIN_ affected photosynthetic proteins at the translational level . apart from those proteins associated with photosynthesis and protein synthesis interestingly a number of proteins involved in stress responses were found in the comparative proteomic analysis to be reduced in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . these included four cold regulated proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and a pathogenesis related protein _PROTEIN_ . in addition two dehydrin family proteins _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and five glutathione transferases _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were reduced in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the down regulation of these stress related proteins in _PROTEIN_ suggested a potential role of _PROTEIN_ in stress responses . role of _PROTEIN_ in cold stress tolerance . relative levels of proteins associated with the cold stress response in _PROTEIN_ plants . values represent from three biological replicates . phenotypes of wild type _PROTEIN_ and two _PROTEIN_ overexpression lines grown on murashige and skoog medium at for weeks . average weight per seedling grown at for weeks . chlorophyll content of seedlings grown at for weeks . values are from four biological replicates . to provide evidence in support of this we compared plant growth of wild type _PROTEIN_ and two _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines under cold treatment at . the two _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines contained and fold increases in the _PROTEIN_ protein levels respectively as measured via relative protein quantification by calculating the identified peptide peak areas of _PROTEIN_ . when these plants were germinated and grown at for weeks the seedlings of the two _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines grew much better and had a dark green color in comparison with those of wild type plants . in contrast the seedlings of _PROTEIN_ showed a more yellow and less green color than the seedlings of wild type control plants . the line had a weak phenotype in comparison with the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the difference in cold tolerance phenotypes between and _PROTEIN_ might be due to the different accumulation of functional _PROTEIN_ protein in and the formation of malfunctioning _PROTEIN_ protein in _PROTEIN_ due to the missense mutation . noticeably the _PROTEIN_ mutant appeared to be more severely affected in the cold but less affected under normal growth conditions than the line suggesting that the malfunctioning _PROTEIN_ protein could function partially under normal growth conditions but was non functional in cold conditions . the seedling weight after weeks of growth at was measured . the _PROTEIN_ mutant exhibited significantly lower seedling weight than the wild type control in contrast the two overexpressing lines showed enhanced seedling weight . moreover the chlorophyll content was also significantly _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant and increased in the two overexpressing lines . these data support the potential role of _PROTEIN_ in cold stress tolerance .
