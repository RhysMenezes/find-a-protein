in _METHOD_ pollen wall pattern formation is determined by primexine deposition on the microspores . here we show that auxin response _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is essential for primexine formation and pollen development in arabidopsis . the _PROTEIN_ mutant exhibited a male sterile phenotype with normal vegetative growth . _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in microsporocytes and microgametophytes from meiosis to the bicellular microspore stage . transmission electron microscopy analysis showed that primexine was absent in the _PROTEIN_ mutant which leads to pollen wall patterning defects and pollen degradation . callose deposition was also significantly reduced in the _PROTEIN_ mutant and the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the major gene for callose biosynthesis was approximately that of the wild type . chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that _PROTEIN_ can directly bind to the _PROTEIN_ promoter . as indicated by the _PROTEIN_ of driven green _METHOD_ protein which is an synthetic auxin response reporter auxin signaling appeared to be specifically impaired in _PROTEIN_ anthers . taken together our results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is essential for pollen wall patterning in arabidopsis by modulating primexine formation at least partially through direct regulation of _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ .
we screened for male sterile plants from the pool of transfer dna tagged lines in arabidopsis ecotype columbia . one completely sterile mutant without any apparently vegetative defects was identified . thermal asymmetric interlaced pcr and sequencing of the flanking sequence revealed that a t dna was inserted in the first exon of the _PROTEIN_ gene . genotype analysis showed that the sterile plants from the progeny of selfed were all homozygous while the fertile plants were either heterozygous or without insertion . this indicates that the t dna insertion in _PROTEIN_ was linked to the sterile phenotype . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ could not be detected in flower buds . genetic complementation was performed to confirm whether knocking out _PROTEIN_ is responsible for the sterile phenotype . a genomic fragment of _PROTEIN_ including bp upstream of the translation start site the intact genomic coding region and bp downstream of the stop codon was cloned and introduced into plants heterozygous for the _PROTEIN_ mutation . we obtained a total of independent transgenic lines . genotyping analysis showed that four of them were homozygous for the _PROTEIN_ mutation . three of these plants were fully fertile indicating that _PROTEIN_ was able to complement the sterile phenotype . the failed complementation of another plant could have been due to a position effect of the transgene . collectively these results demonstrate that knockout of _PROTEIN_ is responsible for the sterile phenotype of this mutant . to distinguish whether male or female defects cause the sterility in _PROTEIN_ we first pollinated the _PROTEIN_ stigma with wild type pollen grains . normal siliques could be obtained indicating that the female fertility in _PROTEIN_ was not affected . we then observed the open flowers from the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ mutant using a dissecting microscope . multiple pollen grains could be found on the anther surface and the stigma of the wild type . in contrast no pollen grains were observed in the _PROTEIN_ flower . further alexander staining of pollen viability showed that the wild type anthers contained purple staining viable pollen grains while only degraded pollen remnants were observed in the _PROTEIN_ anther . these data indicate that knocking out _PROTEIN_ leads to aborted pollen development and male sterility . _PROTEIN_ is widely _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis tissues including the roots leaves _METHOD_ siliques seedlings and buds . to analyze the spatiotemporal _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ during anther development we performed an rna in situ hybridization assay with an _PROTEIN_ specific antisense probe . anther development can be divided into stages . at stage no obvious hybridization signal was detected . apparent hybridization signals were observed in microsporocytes at stage . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was reduced in tetrads at stage and remained detectable in the microspores until stage . in mature pollen no _PROTEIN_ specific hybridization signal was detected . as a control the _PROTEIN_ sense strand probe did not yield any hybridization signal . we further investigated the distribution of the _PROTEIN_ protein . the genomic fragment of _PROTEIN_ was fused with the gene for _METHOD_ and this construct was introduced into the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was shown to be functional because it was able to rescue the male sterile phenotype in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . confocal microscopy of _METHOD_ allows detection of the respective _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins . at stage no _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed . at stage significant _METHOD_ signals were observed in microsporocytes . at stage _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ could be detected within microspores in tetrads . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was also found in the microspores at the uninucleate pollen stage . in bicellular pollen _METHOD_ signals were present in both the germ cell and the vegetative _LOCATION_ . no apparent _METHOD_ signal was detected at either the tricellular or mature pollen stage which is consistent with a previous male gametophyte transcriptome . when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ pollen grains were germinated in vitro _METHOD_ could also be detected in the imbibed pollen grain and pollen tube however the _PROTEIN_ level was lower than that observed from stage to the bicellular microspore stage . in order to understand the defects in _PROTEIN_ in detail we analyzed cross sections prepared from wild type and mutant inflorescences . up to stage no detectable differences could be observed between the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ mutant . diamidino phenylindole staining showed that meiosis is normal in _PROTEIN_ . at stage meiosis is completed and tetrads have formed in the wild type . in contrast the shape of _PROTEIN_ tetrads appeared to be distorted . at stage individual microspores could be observed in both wild type and _PROTEIN_ anthers indicating the normal release of free microspores . from stage to wild type microspores developed an obvious exine layer . in _PROTEIN_ however microspores failed to form an exine layer and became vacuolated and degraded . eventually the pollen wall developed successfully and mature pollen grains were formed in the wild type whereas all _PROTEIN_ microspores degenerated completely leaving only aborted pollen debris . to further investigate the detailed abnormalities in _PROTEIN_ exine development transmission electron microscopy observation was employed . in the wild type locules at stage callose was deposited around microsporocytes with medium electron dense staining . the callose in _PROTEIN_ was much reduced compared with the wild type . at stage the wild type tetrad developed primexine between microspore _LOCATION_ and the callose layer microspore _LOCATION_ became undulated . in contrast the callose in the _PROTEIN_ mutant seemed thinner the primexine and _LOCATION_ undulation were not observed . at the uninucleate and the bicellular microspore stages sporopollenin continued to accumulate on the surface of the microspore to form the bacula tectum and exine in the wild type . however in _PROTEIN_ the sporopollenin randomly accumulated around the microspore surface and no exine could be observed for those shriveled pollen grains . tem observations revealed that _PROTEIN_ pollen had an absence of primexine leading to subsequent aborted exine pattern and microspore degradation . the above observations indicated that callose deposition was _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . to confirm this we stained tetrads from both _PROTEIN_ and wild type anthers with toluidine blue . under light microscopy both wild type and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ complemented plants showed an apparent callose layer in tetrads . by contrast the callose layer of _PROTEIN_ tetrads was ambiguous . we then analyzed callose _METHOD_ by aniline blue staining . both aniline blue staining and _METHOD_ analysis showed that the _METHOD_ of the callose in _PROTEIN_ was obviously weaker than that in wild type and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ complemented plants . these results confirmed that _PROTEIN_ tetrads had a reduced callose deposition . _PROTEIN_ is the major enzyme responsible for peripheral callose synthesis in the tetrad in arabidopsis . we analyzed the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ . real time pcr revealed that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was dramatically _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant compared with the wild type . to further verify these results at the cellular level we performed rna in situ hybridization using a _PROTEIN_ specific probe . the _PROTEIN_ signal reached its peak in microsporocytes and tapetum cells at stage consistent with a previous report . in the _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ transcript abundance was much less than in the wild type confirming reduced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we then compared the _PROTEIN_ of other primexine related genes including _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and wild type inflorescences . both reverse transcription pcr and real time pcr showed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were not altered in _PROTEIN_ whereas _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ was reduced to of that in wild type plants . _PROTEIN_ is an arf transcription _PROTEIN_ and would be expected to regulate gene _PROTEIN_ by binding to the auxre of target gene promoters . an auxre was found between and in the _PROTEIN_ promoter . to corroborate the interaction of the _PROTEIN_ protein with the _PROTEIN_ promoter in vivo we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation _PROTEIN_ assay using buds from a transgenic arabidopsis line that _PROTEIN_ the functional _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ . real time pcr results indicated that one dna fragment containing the predicted arf protein binding site was enriched when the _METHOD_ antibodies were used . however when three other fragments of the _PROTEIN_ promoter were amplified no obvious enrichment was observed . in order to confirm the physical interaction between the _PROTEIN_ protein and the _PROTEIN_ promoter region we performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay _METHOD_ using recombinant _PROTEIN_ proteins fused to glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and a bp _PROTEIN_ promoter fragment containing an auxre motif . the _METHOD_ result showed that the recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein is able to bind this dna fragment . the binding specificity was further confirmed by using unlabeled promoter fragment as a competitor . when the unlabeled dna fragment was added the excess _PROTEIN_ competitor probe reduced the signal in a concentration dependent manner . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ directly binds to the _PROTEIN_ promoter to regulate its _PROTEIN_ . in the population only about of the progeny displayed the male sterile phenotype . this ratio was stable over five consecutive generations . the segregation ratio deviated significantly from the expected suggesting that the gametophyte function may also be affected in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants . we pollinated _PROTEIN_ stigmas with wild type pollen . the segregation ratio of the t dna in the progeny was approximately indicating that the transmission of the t dna through the female gametophyte is not affected and that the _PROTEIN_ ovule is fertile . when wild type stigmas were pollinated with _PROTEIN_ pollen the t dna ratio of the progeny was instead of the expected indicating that male gametophyte transmission is reduced in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . _PROTEIN_ female transmission efficiency mte male transmission efficiency nd not detected . to determine whether the reduced transmission was derived from impaired pollen development pollen germination or pollen tube growth homozygous _PROTEIN_ plants were pollinated with _PROTEIN_ pollen to generate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants . in the _PROTEIN_ plant the four microspores remain associated as tetrads . dapi and alexander staining showed that _PROTEIN_ pollen grains developed normally . we next carried out an in vitro pollen germination assay to test whether the pollen tube performance of _PROTEIN_ was affected . after h of pollen grains from _PROTEIN_ plants germinated in contrast to of wild type pollen grains . this indicated that pollen grain germination in _PROTEIN_ may not be affected . however the average pollen tube length from _PROTEIN_ pollen grains was dramatically reduced and more short pollen tubes were observed compared with the wild type . statistical analysis showed that of _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes were in the range of to whereas only of wild type pollen tubes were in this range of _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes were more than long while of wild type pollen tubes were in this range . this indicates that the _PROTEIN_ mutation affected pollen tube growth . the pollen tube growth defect was further validated in vivo . we pollinated wild type stigmas in emasculated flowers with _PROTEIN_ pollen grains and examined the distribution of wild type and mutant seeds in the upper and lower parts of crossed siliques using a basta herbicide screen . the ratio of mutant seeds from the upper part was obviously higher than that from the lower part . seeds from the upper part of the siliques were mutant while seeds from lower part were only mutant indicating that wild type and heterozygous _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes are not evenly distributed within the ovary . collectively the in vitro and in vivo results showed that _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes grow slower than wild type tubes . the arf family proteins are involved in auxin signaling and can directly regulate the transcription of auxin response genes . to investigate the role of _PROTEIN_ in the auxin response we introduced the synthetic auxin response promoter driving the _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ gene _METHOD_ into the _PROTEIN_ mutant by crossing . in week old wild type plants _METHOD_ _METHOD_ could be detected in the root tip leaf tips and anthers at _PROTEIN_ stages when mature pollen is formed inside . in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals could also be observed in the root tip and leaf tips . however the _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ was barely detected in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ stage anthers . since _PROTEIN_ functions at the tetrad stage we chose to observe the _METHOD_ signal at this stage . in the wild type apparent _METHOD_ signals could be observed at the anther apex and the joint between the anther and filament . however _METHOD_ signal was not observed in tetrads which is consistent with a previous report . in _PROTEIN_ a similar pattern of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was detected to that in the wild type .
