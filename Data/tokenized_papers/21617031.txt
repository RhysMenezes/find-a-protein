in plants green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ is routinely used to determine the subcellular location of fusion proteins . here we show that confocal imaging can be employed to approximate the number of _METHOD_ labeled protein molecules present in living arabidopsis root cells . the technique involves calibration with soluble _METHOD_ to provide a usable protein concentration range within the confocal volume of the microscope . as a proof of principle we quantified the brassinosteroid _PROTEIN_ receptor fused to _METHOD_ under control of its own promoter . the number of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ molecules per root epidermal cell ranges from in the meristem and in the elongation zone to in the maturation zone indicating that up to fold differences in _PROTEIN_ receptor content exist . in contrast when taking into account differences in cell size _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ receptor density in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ is kept constant at receptors in all cells throughout the meristem and elongation zone . only the quiescent center and columella cells deviate from this pattern and have to receptors . remarkably root cell sensitivity toward brassinosteroids appears to coincide with uniform meristem receptor density .
to determine the number of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ molecules per cell by confocal microscopy the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line described by citation was employed . this line _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ contains an equal amount of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein when compared to endogenous _PROTEIN_ protein and shows only a mild overexpression phenotype . root meristem epidermal cells located between three and cells from the quiescent center _PROTEIN_ were chosen as an example . this was based on size uniformity average _PROTEIN_ level location close to the root surface and a small _LOCATION_ that enables determination of pm and intracellular _METHOD_ separately . measurements at the pm were performed at anticlinal cell walls because the periclinal walls are always shared with another cell type . the initial approach was to record z stack images using nyquist sampling . however while these images provide spatial information it resulted in incremental lower _METHOD_ intensity due to bleaching thus rendering it unsuitable for quantification purposes . instead two dimensional confocal images were acquired using only a single scan of roots _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which minimized signal loss due to bleaching . as can been seen in figure _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localizes at the pm as well as in the cytoplasm . the region of interest from which the _METHOD_ intensity at the pm is derived is . this equals the full width of the gaussian fit of the _METHOD_ intensity over the anticlinal cell wall and the two adjacent _METHOD_ . however this area includes signals from the pm and from intracellular _LOCATION_ compartments presumably from the early endosome/trans _LOCATION_ network or the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in close proximity to the pm . the theoretically calculated width of the cell wall and two _METHOD_ as it appears in the microscope is nm which _METHOD_ that in the analyzed area the majority of _METHOD_ intensity measured is pm derived . to approximate the contribution of intracellular _LOCATION_ compartments to the _METHOD_ intensity measured in the gaussian fit over the _METHOD_ the ratio between _METHOD_ intensity at the pm and in the cytoplasm was determined . the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ were not taken into account in the measurements . assuming a uniform distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ containing vesicles in the cytoplasm ratio imaging showed that of the _METHOD_ intensity originates from intracellular _LOCATION_ compartments . in each measurement the ratio between the _METHOD_ intensity observed in the roi at the pm and in the cytoplasm was taken into account to correct for the contribution of intracellular _LOCATION_ compartments to the _METHOD_ intensity assigned to the pm . a calibration curve consisting of free _METHOD_ in solution was generated to correlate with _METHOD_ intensity in a confocal volume . assuming an equal _METHOD_ intensity between free _METHOD_ in solution and in the cytoplasm the concentration in the analyzed roi and subsequently the receptor density could be calculated . since the _METHOD_ intensities are derived from a two dimensional confocal image we refer to the measured _METHOD_ concentration as an apparent concentration . taking into account that the imaged area consists of two _METHOD_ and vesicles in close proximity of the pm the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ receptor density in root meristem epidermal cells was calculated to be receptors pm . this corresponds to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ receptors per cell in the pm . a similar approach was applied to calculate the number of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ receptors in intracellular compartments only in this instance the _METHOD_ intensity measurements in the cytoplasm were used as the starting point . the volume of the cytoplasm was calculated by subtracting the volume of the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ from the volume of the entire cell . results show that in root meristem epidermal cells there are _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ receptors localized in intracellular compartments in addition to the receptors present in the pm resulting in a total of approximately _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ molecules per cell . equation for the calculation of the _PROTEIN_ receptor density is as follows in which _PROTEIN_ is the number of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ receptors at the pm vapp is the apparent volume in capp is the apparent concentration in _PROTEIN_ is the percentage of cytoplasm localized _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the roi and na is avogadro s constant . to ensure that the quantitative _METHOD_ imaging method as described above is capable of distinguishing cells _PROTEIN_ different amounts of receptors several approaches were employed . for comparative purposes receptor density at the pm was used rather than the total amount of receptors present to rule out differences due to changes in subcellular distribution . first the number of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ molecules was determined in root meristem epidermal cells of another _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in which _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is significantly higher and showing an overexpression phenotype . using quantitative confocal microscopy the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ receptor density in root meristem epidermal cells of d old seedlings of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line is receptors approximately times higher than the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line . the difference in _PROTEIN_ level was verified by quantitative western blotting . next the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ receptor density in root meristem epidermal cells of a hemizygous line of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line was found to be half of the homozygous line . to test system independency the number of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ receptors pm was also determined in root meristem epidermal cells using two different confocal microscopes a _PROTEIN_ and a _PROTEIN_ meta . the results obtained showed no significant differences in receptor values . finally the receptor density of _PROTEIN_ yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ corresponding to the two nonligand binding coreceptors of _PROTEIN_ was determined in root meristem epidermal cells using _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines . for quantification of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a new calibration curve was generated now using _METHOD_ instead of _METHOD_ . quantitative confocal microscopy revealed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ receptor density is receptors and that of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is receptors . gene _PROTEIN_ studies showed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is indeed higher and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is lower compared to _PROTEIN_ in root meristem epidermal cells . taken together we conclude that the quantitative confocal microscopy method as described here faithfully reports changes in pm receptor density and is applicable to different receptors . the next step was to provide a receptor density map of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in other cell types in the root meristem and the elongation and maturation zones . unfortunately _METHOD_ intensities derived from _METHOD_ molecules present in more internally located cell types can be influenced by scattering and absorption effects . therefore _METHOD_ intensity measured in various cell types in the root meristem was compared with published gene _PROTEIN_ data . the results indicate that there is a close correlation between gene _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ protein concentration . signal attenuation due to scattering and absorption apparently has a minor influence on our results . however we have restricted our measurements to the upper cell layers not exceeding a distance of to from the cell surface . in the root meristem _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line pm receptor density remains constant at about receptors in root epidermal cortex and endodermis cells with a similar distribution between pm and intracellular compartments . in leaf epidermal cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is present at about receptors . in _PROTEIN_ root cap cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ density rises to about receptors but is significantly lower in columella and _PROTEIN_ cells at and receptors respectively . in contrast to the other cell types the receptor density of the _PROTEIN_ cells was recorded from their joined periclinal walls . this was corroborated by the intermediate receptor density observed in their anticlinal walls joined with those of the different stem cell populations just above the _PROTEIN_ . these data show that adjacent _LOCATION_ can differ at least to fold in receptor density . in the transition and elongation zone epidermal cells receptor density remained constant at approximately receptors . only in the fully expanded epidermal cells in the maturation zone was a strong reduction of receptor density observed . in these cells _METHOD_ _METHOD_ intensity is reduced to almost the level of the _METHOD_ background . therefore receptor density could only be estimated to be about receptors with a correspondingly large sd . however due to their fold increase in size the total number of receptors per epidermal cell remains higher than in the meristem . this is confirmed by semiquantitative western blot analysis indicating that the amount of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is slightly higher in the maturation zone when compared to the meristem . measured cell length and width of various cells in a d old col seedling . to obtain an independent estimate of the number of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ molecules per root quantitative immunological detection of _METHOD_ in total root protein extracts from the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line was employed . the results show that roots of d old arabidopsis seedlings contain pmol fresh weight _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . to estimate the number of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ receptors per root from quantitative confocal microscopy several approximations were made a d old root when cut just below the hypocotyl has a fresh weight of mg and each cut root has cells . the number of cells in the root of a d old seedling was calculated using published data as well as measurements described in this article . details concerning the calculations can be found in materials and methods and in supplemental files and . the total number of cells in each of the different cell types shown in table ii and the estimated number of receptors per cell was then calculated and predicts that a d old _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line root contains pmol of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . this value is about fold higher than the value of pmol as determined by western blotting . the difference is likely due to the uncertainty in estimating the amount of bri _METHOD_ in the maturation zone and in internal cell layers . however we conclude that both numbers are close enough to validate the use of quantitative confocal microscopy as described here . in root epidermal cells _PROTEIN_ receptor density is _PROTEIN_ at a constant level from the meristem up to the maturation zone . to elucidate whether _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ receptor density may have functional significance it is required to know which root cells respond to bl . two recent studies reveal that cells in the root meristem are primarily responsible for the observed inhibitory effects of bl and overexpression of the _PROTEIN_ receptor . there is a clear reduction in the number of meristem cells by approximately after treatment of wild type roots to nm bl while root growth is reduced by about in a _PROTEIN_ overexpression line identical to the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line used here . under the conditions employed in our work the same reduction in meristem cell number and in root growth reduction was observed . the direct target cells of bl signaling were identified as belonging to the stem cell niche including the _PROTEIN_ affecting both division rate and elongation and extending into the elongation zone primarily affecting cell expansion . interestingly the second study points to the same epidermal cells we used here as example cells for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ quantification as the ones that are responsible for regulating the entire effect of _PROTEIN_ mediated signaling in root _METHOD_ . remarkably the _PROTEIN_ receptor density rather than the total number of receptors per cell is kept constant in all cells identified as direct targets of bl signaling in the meristematic zone of the root in both independent studies . at present no experimental strategy in plants is available to independently change _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ receptor density while leaving the total number of active receptors and the cell size unaltered .

extinction coefficient of was used . for calculations of the _METHOD_ concentration a molar extinction coefficient of was used . the concentration and purity of the stock solution confirmed by _METHOD_ brilliant blue staining after _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ electrophoresis using a range from to bovine serum albumin as reference compound . for the _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ standard curve dilutions of _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ were made in a _PROTEIN_ solution of ph which is similar to the ph in the cytoplasm . two hundred microliters of different dilutions of _METHOD_ were transferred to well plates

. the pinhole diameter was adjusted to a slice _PROTEIN_ of approximately . all z stacks were generated using a slice _PROTEIN_ of approximately thereby fulfilling nyquist sampling criteria . for each confocal system used the linear range of the detector and the effect of bleaching were evaluated . bleaching of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ can occur upon long exposure time or high intensity laser power . to limit bleaching effects all images used for quantification were taken within s from the moment the root was exposed to the laser . the mean pixel intensity in the cytoplasmic area and at the pm was measured separately using imagepro plus software . a low pass filter was used to lower the background noise in the images . all _METHOD_ intensities measured were corrected for _METHOD_ by subtracting the _METHOD_ intensity measured in wild type lines in the corresponding tissue and cell type . in order to correlate the _METHOD_ intensity in the root tissue with the _METHOD_ calibration curve the confocal settings and data analysis were kept the same for all images obtained during an experiment . the same protocol was followed to quantify _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ only in that case _METHOD_ instead of _METHOD_ was used to generate the calibration curve . each quantitative imaging session was accompanied by a parallel calibration curve to avoid differences due to experimental conditions . to
