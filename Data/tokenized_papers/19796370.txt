receptor mediated sorting processes in the secretory pathway of eukaryotic cells rely on _METHOD_ to recycle the receptors after completion of transport . based on this principle plant _LOCATION_ sorting receptors are thought to recycle after dissociating of receptor ligand complexes in a pre _LOCATION_ compartment . this recycling is mediated by retromer a _LOCATION_ coat complex that comprises sorting nexins and a large heterotrimeric subunit . to analyse retromer mediated vsr recycling we have used a combination of immunoelectron and _METHOD_ microscopy to localize the retromer components sorting nexin _PROTEIN_ and sorting nexin _PROTEIN_ and the _LOCATION_ sorting protein _PROTEIN_ . all retromer components localize to the trans _LOCATION_ network which is considered to represent the early endosome of plants . in addition we show that inhibition of retromer function in vivo by _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutants as well as transient rnai knockdown of all sorting nexins led to accumulation of the vsr _PROTEIN_ at the tgn . quantitative protein transport studies and live cell imaging using _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ cargo molecules revealed that arrival of these vsr ligands at the _LOCATION_ is not affected under these conditions . based on these findings we propose that the tgn is the location of retromer mediated recycling of vsrs and that transport towards the lytic _LOCATION_ downstream of the tgn is receptor independent and occurs via maturation similar to transition of the early endosome into the _PROTEIN_ endosome in mammalian cells .
the arabidopsis sorting nexins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ possess a px domain and two coiled coil regions constituting bar domains at the c terminus . _PROTEIN_ has a shorter n terminal domain reducing the overall sequence similarity to only approximately . nevertheless there is a high degree of homology in their px and bar domains . to characterize the arabidopsis sorting nexins we have cloned _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and generated _METHOD_ tagged fusions for in vivo imaging studies . when co _PROTEIN_ with the cis _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in protoplasts from cultured arabidopsis cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ gave rise to punctate signals that did not overlap with the _LOCATION_ signals and only a minority of these signals were adjacent to each other . when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was co _PROTEIN_ with the tgn marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ approximately of the signals overlapped indicating a tgn localization for _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ has the same subcellular distribution as the signals co localize with _PROTEIN_ . however some _PROTEIN_ structures appear to lack _PROTEIN_ . co _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ mkate and the pvc marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ resulted in virtually no overlap of signals indicating that _PROTEIN_ is not localized to the pvc . in contrast there was a small degree of overlap with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal . in tobacco protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ gave a more _LOCATION_ and less punctate pattern and these punctate signals overlapped with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ rather than _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . as in arabidopsis protoplasts signals for the two sorting nexins co localized but _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not show any overlap . to ascertain the location of endogenous sorting nexins we generated a polyclonal antibody using two peptides that are present in the n terminal domain of _PROTEIN_ but not in _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . accordingly this antibody was specific for _PROTEIN_ and did not cross react with either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . as protoplasts can not be permeabilized without bursting we first performed _METHOD_ on roots from transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ markers for _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tgn _METHOD_ and pvc _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . no overlap of signals was observed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ but a close association between the _PROTEIN_ immunosignal and the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was seen . we also observed an almost perfect co localization of vha _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ . in addition _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ on transgenic tobacco by cell lines _PROTEIN_ markers either for the pvc _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or the tgn _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was performed . there was no overlap between _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and only a partial overlap with the _LOCATION_ signals . in contrast there was an almost perfect overlap with the tgn signals . for immunogold electron microscopy we used root tips of arabidopsis and tobacco because structural preservation by high pressure freezing is better with this tissue than with the more highly vacuolated by cells . iem using _PROTEIN_ antibodies was specific with virtually no background labelling . gold particles were present at the trans face of _LOCATION_ stacks in both arabidopsis and tobacco roots . in addition gold particles decorated numerous vesicles in the core of the brefeldin a compartment which is an aggregate of tgn and endosomal derived _LOCATION_ formed in response to bfa treatment . in contrast multi vesicular bodies were not labelled with _PROTEIN_ immunogold . we also re investigated the distribution of the large subunit of retromer by monitoring for _PROTEIN_ . we therefore performed _METHOD_ analyses with _PROTEIN_ antibodies in tobacco by cells as well as iem on arabidopsis and tobacco roots . in contrast to previous observations on by cells we saw no overlap with the pvc marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and only a partial overlap with the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . however we did observe a perfect overlap of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . as was the case with _PROTEIN_ iem of _PROTEIN_ in both arabidopsis and tobacco roots showed tgn localization with no label on multi vesicular pvcs . similarly this antigen also localized to the core of the bfa compartment . together the confocal laser scanning microscopy and iem data obtained for both arabidopsis and tobacco provide unequivocal evidence that the sorting nexins and the large subunit of retromer locate to the tgn rather than the pvc . the most certain way of determining the location of endogenous _PROTEIN_ type vsrs in the cell is by immunological methods e.g . iem . however a _PROTEIN_ construct consisting of _METHOD_ fused to the transmembrane domain and _LOCATION_ tail of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ has been used on a number of occasions to visualize the steady state distribution of endogenous vsrs . this truncated reporter contains the trafficking motifs of the wild type vsr and can compete for transport with endogenous receptors making it a useful tool to monitor vsr transport . in addition the distribution of this reporter construct faithfully reflects the location of endogenous vsrs as shown by iem with _PROTEIN_ antibodies in tobacco by cells . in tobacco by cells _PROTEIN_ locates almost exclusively to the multi vesicular pvc and has proved to be a reliable marker for this organelle . however in stably transformed arabidopsis lines _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localized to both wortmannin responsive structures and the bfa compartment . as the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signals in by cells were sensitive only to wortmannin we surmised that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is not restricted to the pvc in arabidopsis root cells . to test this we performed iem on roots of arabidopsis and tobacco . in both cases gold label was detected at the trans _LOCATION_ but also at multi vesiculate pvcs . _PROTEIN_ label was always situated at the periphery of the pvc and under the same labelling conditions the pvc in root cells of arabidopsis was generally more conspicuously labelled than the pvc in tobacco root cells . to analyse the function of the two sorting nexins in vivo we prepared sorting nexin mutants that lacked either the coiled coil domains _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in order to prevent _LOCATION_ deformation and thus the formation of retromer coated vesicles or the n terminal domain _PROTEIN_ in order to inhibit interaction with the large retromer subunit and thus packaging of cargo into these vesicles . to avoid possible steric hindrance caused by a _METHOD_ tag and to ensure that the sorting nexin mutants were still able to interact with the large retromer unit or with another sorting nexin and with the endosomal _LOCATION_ via their px domain we used untagged mutants in these experiments . this is justified because the rate of co transfection of various plasmids via electroporation was extremely high . when two plasmids encoding _METHOD_ proteins were co transfected of the transformed cells _PROTEIN_ both proteins and triple co transfection yielded only a slightly reduced rate with of the transformed cells _PROTEIN_ all three proteins . when tobacco leaf protoplasts were transfected with standard pvc _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ markers we obtained separate signals in approximately of the protoplasts and adjacent/co localizing signals in only . this situation was unchanged when wild type sorting nexins were co _PROTEIN_ . in contrast when the mutant of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ and pvc signals became closely associated . the same effect was observed when the mutant of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ . in contrast to the control all sorting nexin mutants changed the distribution of the _LOCATION_ and pvc markers to approximately immediately adjacent/co localized signals with only approximately of the signals remaining separate from each other . thus a significant difference in the percentage of overlapping signals was observed between control and mutant protoplasts . this raised the question of whether the mutants caused leakage of the _LOCATION_ marker to a post _LOCATION_ location or trapping of the pvc marker at the _LOCATION_ . to elucidate the identity of the compartments showing partially overlapping _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signals as a result of _PROTEIN_ of mutant sorting nexins we treated protoplasts at the end of the _PROTEIN_ period with either wortmannin or bfa . the former inhibitor causes the pvc to swell yielding a _PROTEIN_ like structure while bfa in tobacco but not arabidopsis results in a redistribution of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ into the _LOCATION_ . these effects were confirmed in controls _PROTEIN_ only the marker proteins and were also observed when wild type snx was _PROTEIN_ . however whereas wortmannin had no effect on the punctate signals of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in either of the two mutant _PROTEIN_ samples bfa caused the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals to assume an _LOCATION_ like distribution in each case . in contrast only a portion of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signal shifted to the _LOCATION_ with the rest remaining punctuate indicating that it is localized to a part of the _LOCATION_ apparatus that is bfa insensitive which in tobacco can only be the tgn . these results show that _PROTEIN_ of sorting nexin mutants causes the _LOCATION_ receptor _PROTEIN_ to accumulate in the _LOCATION_ apparatus/tgn rather than _LOCATION_ enzymes being transported forward into the pvc . as _PROTEIN_ of the sorting nexin mutants caused _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to redistribute into the tgn we wondered whether under these _METHOD_ pvcs were still present . to answer this question we first _PROTEIN_ the pvc marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ together with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and either the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutants . in both cases there was a clear separation of _METHOD_ signals caused by the mutants compared with the controls . based on the assumption that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is a bona fide marker for the pvc which is recruited from the _LOCATION_ onto the _LOCATION_ this observation provides evidence for the continued presence of pvcs . in control protoplasts approximately co localization between the two pvc markers was observed with still co localized after _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ . in a second approach we _PROTEIN_ an rnai construct to induce post translational gene silencing of the snxs . this construct was directed against the first cc domain of _PROTEIN_ but was also expected to affect the other two sorting nexins due to the high degree of similarity within this domain . to avoid non specific silencing of other cc domain containing proteins a blast search against the arabidopsis genome database was performed but apart from a chloroplast localized protein of unknown function no further homologous sequences were found . _PROTEIN_ of this rnai construct led to a dramatic loss of detectable _PROTEIN_ in both arabidopsis and tobacco protoplasts . however the same phenotype was obtained as when snx mutants were _PROTEIN_ a separation of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals . thus perturbation of sorting nexin function does not prevent the formation of pvcs . as pvcs in all plant cells are wortmannin sensitive we tested the effects of wortmannin on the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ positive structures . unlike the control protoplasts neither the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ nor the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals formed _PROTEIN_ structures in protoplasts _PROTEIN_ the snx mutants after application of wortmannin . in contrast the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ positive structures in protoplasts _PROTEIN_ the snxccrnai construct were sensitive to wortmannin . thus the pvcs that are formed after _PROTEIN_ of the snx mutants are qualitatively different to those of wild type cells and to those of cells in which snx _PROTEIN_ is repressed . as _PROTEIN_ of the sorting nexin mutants caused an arrest of _PROTEIN_ in the tgn we determined whether the mutants result in a general inhibition of protein export from the tgn or whether the observed effect is specific for _PROTEIN_ ligands . therefore we performed quantitative protein transport assays using barley amylase as a reporter for transport to the cell surface and a derivative thereof carrying the sequence specific _LOCATION_ sorting signal of sweet potato sporamin to monitor transport to the lytic _LOCATION_ . as shown in figure transport of the secretory reporter amylase to the cell surface was not significantly reduced when either _PROTEIN_ or were co _PROTEIN_ at the same concentration that trapped _PROTEIN_ at the tgn . this was also true for each _PROTEIN_ mutant . this demonstrates that the arrest of _PROTEIN_ at the tgn is not due to a general inhibition of protein export . surprisingly when the _LOCATION_ reporter amylase sporamin was co _PROTEIN_ under the same conditions as for each of the _PROTEIN_ mutants or the _PROTEIN_ mutants its transport is not affected either . this suggests that transport of soluble cargo molecules to the lytic _LOCATION_ still occurs despite the _LOCATION_ sorting receptor _PROTEIN_ being trapped at the tgn . to confirm this we co _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ sporamin as a _LOCATION_ reporter . this molecule carries the same sequence specific _LOCATION_ sorting signal as amylase sporamin but also allows precise biochemical analysis of _LOCATION_ transport as the kda transit form is proteolytically degraded in the lytic _LOCATION_ upon arrival yielding a kda form termed the _METHOD_ core . as monitored using _METHOD_ antibodies figure shows the distribution of _METHOD_ sporamin in the culture medium and the different _METHOD_ of the reporter in cellular fractions . when _METHOD_ sporamin is _PROTEIN_ alone the majority of the reporter is detected in the _LOCATION_ form and only a small amount is detected in its transit form . co _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ mutant increased the amount of transit form in medium and cellular fractions presumably due to slightly reduced transport efficiency . however the mutant did not prevent the processing of _METHOD_ sporamin into the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ core and thus arrival of the reporter at the _LOCATION_ at concentrations that were shown to block the transport of _PROTEIN_ . to rule out the possibility that this detected _METHOD_ core was the result of degradation caused by the release of _LOCATION_ enzymes during sample preparation protoplasts _PROTEIN_ only amylase sporamin were incubated with wortmannin in an additional control experiment . this drug is known to induce the secretion of _PROTEIN_ ligands and therefore inhibits delivery to the lytic _LOCATION_ . figure shows the increased amount of the secreted transit form in the culture medium caused by treatment with wortmannin . moreover the cellular fraction contained only the unprocessed transit form but not the _METHOD_ core . this demonstrates that the _METHOD_ core which was detected in the presence of the sorting nexin mutant is indeed the result of _LOCATION_ delivery . these findings were corroborated by directly visualizing the _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ reporters aleurain _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ sporamin in vivo . the typical _LOCATION_ pattern of both reporter molecules was not abolished by the _PROTEIN_ of either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ and the _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ of the protoplasts remained visible in all cases . however this _LOCATION_ signal was somewhat weaker and increased labelling at the periphery was seen suggesting that _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ does partially retard transport into the _LOCATION_ . the same results were obtained by the co _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutants with each of the two _METHOD_ reporters . taken together these results show that while _PROTEIN_ of sorting nexin mutants trapped _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ at the tgn the overall consequences for _LOCATION_ protein transport are marginal .
