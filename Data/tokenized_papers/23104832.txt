eukaryotic _METHOD_ have evolved a set of strategies to safeguard genome integrity but the underlying _METHOD_ remain poorly understood . here we report that asymmetric _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ an arabidopsis thaliana gene encoding a protein in the evolutionarily conserved domain of unknown function family participates in the _LOCATION_ iron sulfur cluster assembly pathway to _PROTEIN_ genome integrity . the severe allele is embryo lethal whereas plants with the weak allele are viable but exhibit highly accumulated dna damage that activates the dna damage response to arrest the cell cycle . _PROTEIN_ is part of a protein complex with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which are highly conserved in eukaryotes and are involved in the biogenesis of _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ fe s proteins . plants have lower activities of the _LOCATION_ enzyme aconitase and the _LOCATION_ enzyme dna glycosylase _PROTEIN_ . additionally mutations in the gene encoding the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ binding cassette transporter _PROTEIN_ which is required for the activity of _LOCATION_ fe s enzymes in arabidopsis also result in defective genome integrity similar to that of . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is a central member of the cia pathway linking plant mitochondria to _LOCATION_ genome integrity through assembly of fe s proteins .
we previously showed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was associated with proliferating cells in a pattern similar to that of the cell cycle marker gene and that the dna repair gene _PROTEIN_ was upregulated in the mutant . to test whether _PROTEIN_ is involved in dna repair we first examined the sensitivity of seedlings to dna damage agents methyl methanesulfonate _METHOD_ and cisplatin . _METHOD_ is a dna alkylating agent and can cause dsbs whereas cisplatin is a cross linking reagent that induces dna lesions . compared with the wild type the growth of seedlings was strongly compromised in the presence of _METHOD_ and cisplatin . this sensitivity to dna damage agents suggests that _PROTEIN_ is involved in dna replication and/or repair . to gain direct evidence that carries increased dna damage we performed a comet assay to measure dna breakage using the first pair leaves of d old seedlings . because the extent of dna damage differed from cell to cell even in the same plant we classified the comet signals into four grades based on a ratio of signal intensities from the comet tail over the entire _LOCATION_ . at the developmental stage examined only weak dna damage signals were detected in the wild type leaves whereas not only was dna damage more severe but also the number of cells containing damaged dna markedly increased in the leaves of seedlings . the results further indicate the role of _PROTEIN_ in dna replication and/or repair . in eukaryotic cells dna damage usually leads to activation of _PROTEIN_ mediated signaling response cascades that turn on dna repair machineries and arrest or delay cell cycle progression . since dna damage highly accumulated in the mutant we next examined _PROTEIN_ of several genes that are often induced in the dna damage response . the tested genes included _PROTEIN_ genes that encode poly polymerases required for the _PROTEIN_ of dna integrity during replication breast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and gamma _PROTEIN_ that are involved in dsb repair by the homologous recombination pathway _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ that are required for dsb repair by the nonhomologous end joining pathway _PROTEIN_ that is activated in response to dsbs and ribonucleotide reductase _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ that are specifically induced by hydroxyurea . our real time quantitative rt pcr showed that among the genes tested transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were elevated in . to understand better the functions of _PROTEIN_ we backcrossed the mutant _LOCATION_ to wild type columbia five times and then introduced several marker lines that are in the col background into . compared with wild type plants the and plants displayed overall similar phenotypic abnormalities with a smaller size and narrower serrated leaves . activation of the dna damage response in the background was also confirmed by _PROTEIN_ staining of the gus transgenic plants gus staining appeared strongly in the shoot apex and young leaves of the seedlings but was barely detectable in the wild type col . to investigate whether the activated dna damage response in leads to cell cycle arrest we introduced a dbox gus construct _PROTEIN_ into plants by crossing . _PROTEIN_ is activated in the _PROTEIN_ phase and the _PROTEIN_ gus protein is degraded at metaphase thus gus staining marks cells in the _PROTEIN_ to m transition . compared with the wild type gus signals strongly accumulated in the shoot apex of indicating that mutation resulted in delayed or arrested transition of _PROTEIN_ to m phase . all of these results strongly suggest that the accumulated dna damage causes activation of dna damage responses in the mutants leading to arrest of the cell cycle . in eukaryotes dsbs are repaired in part via the hr pathway which is important for _PROTEIN_ genome integrity . given that seedlings are hypersensitive to dna damaging agents exhibited increased levels of dna damage and upregulated genes involved in hr mediated dsb repair we employed an hr repair assay which allows recombination events to be visualized and scored by gus histochemical staining .the mutant was crossed to two hr reporter lines and which carry a t dna construct containing parts of the gus gene with an overlapping sequence in a direct or inverted orientation respectively . if an intrachromosomal recombination event occurs between the overlapping sequences a functional gus gene will be reconstituted and _PROTEIN_ therefore gus staining in these lines reflects the frequency of intrachromosomal hr . compared with line in the wild type background a much greater number of gus spots/patches were observed in the plants . about of the plants carried more than gus staining spots with an average of per plant . for plants showed more than nine gus spots with an average of per plant . by contrast and in the wild type background yielded far fewer gus spots with approximately eight and three per plant on average respectively . these results indicate that the mutation severely increased dsb events leading to a higher frequency of intrachromosomal hr . to provide additional evidence that accumulation of dna damage stimulated intrachromosomal hr repair in we introduced the _PROTEIN_ mutation into the mutant by crossing . the _PROTEIN_ gene encodes a family protein functioning in dna recombination and repair and is required for somatic hr . although the _PROTEIN_ single mutant was indistinguishable from the wild type plants the _PROTEIN_ double mutant displayed much stronger developmental defects than as shown by the reduced plant size . compared with the wild type plants of the _PROTEIN_ plants carried arrested leaf primordia . because _PROTEIN_ functions in the intrachromosomal hr repair pathway it is likely that the enhanced _PROTEIN_ phenotypes are due to a strongly _PROTEIN_ efficiency of intrachromosomal hr repair . to test whether _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as reported for the yeast and human homologs we performed yeast two hybrid assays with the arabidopsis proteins . yeast cells that coexpressed the _PROTEIN_ bait and the _PROTEIN_ prey the _PROTEIN_ bait and the _PROTEIN_ prey or the _PROTEIN_ bait and _PROTEIN_ prey promoted the _PROTEIN_ of the and reporter genes allowing cells to grow on media lacking his and adenine . however an interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ not detected using this assay . to confirm the protein protein interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we performed a coimmunoprecipitation assay . tandem affinity protein tagged _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ tagged _PROTEIN_ proteins were coexpressed transiently in the leaves of nicotiana benthamiana and the protein extracts were immunoprecipitated with igg beads followed by immunoblotting analysis . the _PROTEIN_ tap protein but not tap alone coprecipitated the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ protein was associated with _PROTEIN_ in planta . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interactions were also confirmed by bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation assays . yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in cells coinfiltrated with _PROTEIN_ yn and _PROTEIN_ yc or _PROTEIN_ yn and the c terminal domain of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but not in cells with _PROTEIN_ yn and yc _PROTEIN_ yc and yn or _PROTEIN_ c yc and yn . additionally subcellular localization experiments revealed that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ mcherry and _PROTEIN_ mcherry fusion proteins were present in both _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm further supporting the possibility that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function in the same protein complex . the direct interactions between the arabidopsis cia members prompted us to investigate further whether the corresponding mutants display similar developmental defects . one ds transposon insertional mutant heterozygous for _PROTEIN_ two t dna insertional mutants heterozygous for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and another two t dna insertional mutants heterozygous for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were obtained . because no homozygous plants were identified from the segregating population of any of these mutants we examined seeds in the siliques of heterozygous plants . aborted seeds were found among normal ones in a ratio in each of these mutant alleles _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to investigate the possible roles of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in embryonic development we analyzed embryo phenotypes of the defective seeds from siliques of heterozygous mutant plants using nomarski differential interference contrast microscopy . different from those in the wild type the embryos displayed an irregular cell division pattern and arrested at the globular stage . compared with the wild type embryos embryos of _PROTEIN_ were arrested even earlier resulting in a smaller apical part with abnormal shapes . no embryo structure was observed in the aborted seeds of _PROTEIN_ possibly due to defective cell division at the very early embryogenesis stage or gametophytic sterility . in contrast with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which are indispensable for arabidopsis phenotypes of two knockout mutant alleles of the single _PROTEIN_ gene were indistinguishable from those of the wild type . to investigate a genetic interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we crossed to _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . in the progeny plants with enhanced phenotypes were found but genotyping analysis demonstrated that all the enhancer mutants were _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ plants . in addition the plants with phenotypes included _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ whereas _PROTEIN_ double mutant plants were not found in the populations . we further analyzed the seeds in the siliques of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants and found that about a quarter of seeds were aborted indicating that _PROTEIN_ double homozygotes were not viable . to start our investigation into whether _PROTEIN_ and its interaction partners in arabidopsis play a role in fe s protein biogenesis we performed yeast complementation assays . first we tested whether _PROTEIN_ is able to rescue a yeast _PROTEIN_ mutant but introduction of _PROTEIN_ into the yeast cells failed to rescue their growth on selective medium . at _PROTEIN_ shares identity and similarity over the entire amino acid sequence with yeast _PROTEIN_ with seven conserved wd repeats . next we tested at _PROTEIN_ for complementation of the inducible gal _PROTEIN_ mutant in which the endogenous _PROTEIN_ promoter is replaced by the gal inducible _PROTEIN_ promoter . because _PROTEIN_ is essential for yeast viability the gal _PROTEIN_ cells were able to grow only on the gal containing medium . however by shifting the cells from gal to glc as a sole _PROTEIN_ source the endogenous _PROTEIN_ protein was depleted and the cells carrying the empty vector stopped growing unless another copy of the yeast _PROTEIN_ gene driven by a different promoter was _PROTEIN_ . growth of the _PROTEIN_ depleted cells could also be rescued by _PROTEIN_ of the arabidopsis homolog although the growth was slower than with yeast _PROTEIN_ . further biochemical analysis showed that the activities of two _LOCATION_ enzymes isopropylmalate isomerase and sulfite reductase were partially restored by _PROTEIN_ of at _PROTEIN_ . these results indicate that at _PROTEIN_ is a functional ortholog of yeast _PROTEIN_ . to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ plays a role in the assembly of fe s proteins like its yeast homolog _PROTEIN_ we analyzed activities of aconitases and aldehyde oxidases _PROTEIN_ which carry and clusters respectively in seedlings . two prominent aco activities were visualized by in gel staining in the wild type corresponding to the _LOCATION_ and one of the mitochondrial isozymes . both activities were _PROTEIN_ in seedling extracts the _LOCATION_ activity by and the mitochondrial activity by . the _PROTEIN_ levels of aco activity were confirmed using cell fractionation and a photospectrometric assay . levels of aco protein were also diminished in as shown by protein blot analysis with specific antibodies against aco but the transcript levels of aco genes were not affected . these results indicate a posttranscriptional defect in aco biogenesis most likely a lack of fe s cluster assembly which is known to destabilize the protein . by contrast the activities of _PROTEIN_ isozymes were unchanged in the mutant although a slight _PROTEIN_ of the upper activity was noticeable . next we performed a pcr assay to assess the demethylation activity of _PROTEIN_ a dna glycosylase closely related to demeter for which methylcytosine excision activity has been shown to depend on the cluster ligands . genomic dna from wild type and leaves was digested with mcrbc which only cuts when methylated cytosines are present followed by pcr with primer sets spanning two different loci known to be methylated . the _PROTEIN_ dependent locus of _GENE_ was hypermethylated in compared with the wild type based on the absence or presence respectively of a pcr product . similarly the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence was hypermethylated in mutants and in _PROTEIN_ but not in the wild type . control pcr reactions for undigested dna or actin confirmed that differences in the levels of pcr product were due to methylation status rather than dna template concentration . also the levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were not affected at the mrna level . the requirement of _PROTEIN_ for the activity of at least two fe s enzymes indicates that the function of the cia pathway is conserved in plants . to extend our knowledge of the arabidopsis cia pathway we further analyzed phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ as the arabidopsis ortholog of yeast _PROTEIN_ is known to be critical for the activity of _LOCATION_ fe s enzymes . we chose to focus our study on the weak _PROTEIN_ allele which has a similar reduction in growth as the weak alleles . compared with that of the wild type the number of palisade cells was reduced markedly and _PROTEIN_ gus accumulated strongly in the _PROTEIN_ leaves similar to those of in which cell proliferation was defective . in addition the _PROTEIN_ double mutant displayed enhanced phenotypic abnormalities compared with either or _PROTEIN_ single mutant including diminutive plant size and serrated leaves . the phenotypic analysis strongly indicates a genetic interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . our _PROTEIN_ analysis revealed that transcript levels of the dna damage inducible genes including _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were elevated significantly in _PROTEIN_ consistent with upregulation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ another _PROTEIN_ allele . additionally _PROTEIN_ seedlings were also hypersensitive to cisplatin similar to seedlings . we also introduced _PROTEIN_ into the hr marker lines and . compared with wild type plants the number of gus stained spots was increased for both the and plants . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ function is also required for _PROTEIN_ genome integrity .
