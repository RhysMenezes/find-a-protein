previously we screened seedlings of arabidopsis thaliana carrying a _PROTEIN_ luc bioluminescence reporter gene mutagenized with ethylmethanesulfonate for mutants with phenotypes of extensively altered circadian _METHOD_ and identified three loci phytoclock _PROTEIN_ and whose mutations cause arrhythmia . here we succeeded to clone the _PROTEIN_ gene and show that the _PROTEIN_ gene encodes a novel dna binding protein belonging to the garp protein family and is essential for a functional clock oscillator in a. thaliana . the _PROTEIN_ gene satisfies the requirements for the clock oscillator gene _PROTEIN_ null mutations caused arrhythmia in multiple circadian outputs including _PROTEIN_ of potential clock genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and flowering lacked a photoperiodic response _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed circadian rhythm in both constant light and constant dark of the _PROTEIN_ gene gradually caused arrhythmicity in all the multiple circadian outputs examined and the _PROTEIN_ gene controlled its own _PROTEIN_ via negative feedback . therefore the _PROTEIN_ gene is the clock oscillator gene essential to the generation of clock oscillation in the higher plant .
although several potential clock genes have been identified in arabidopsis none of their null mutations cause arrhythmia . in contrast the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants abolish the circadian bioluminescence _METHOD_ of plants carrying a _PROTEIN_ luc reporter gene _PROTEIN_ in both constant light and constant dark . they also show arrhythmia in leaf movement which is distinct from the circadian output of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . moreover _PROTEIN_ mutations affect photoperiodic flowering induction strains flowered earlier in long day than in short day but this photoperiodic response is abolished in the mutants . since both the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ the same phenotype for circadian _METHOD_ and photoperiodic flowering we elected to use _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ mutant for our experiments . circadian _METHOD_ are synchronized by environmental cues such as light/dark _PROTEIN_ and high temperature/low temperature _PROTEIN_ cycles . in plants carrying the _PROTEIN_ luc reporter gene bioluminescence _METHOD_ are synchronized by both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cycles . they show robust _METHOD_ that peak in the light period in _PROTEIN_ cycles and the high temperature period in _PROTEIN_ cycles . in contrast _PROTEIN_ bioluminescence showed only the diurnal _METHOD_ driven by _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ transitions but not autonomous circadian _METHOD_ . during _PROTEIN_ cycles the _PROTEIN_ mutant showed a bioluminescence waveform reflecting _PROTEIN_ of the reporter gene . during _PROTEIN_ cycles the mutant again showed a square bioluminescence waveform reflecting luciferase activity . the bioluminescence of the _PROTEIN_ mutant carrying the _PROTEIN_ luc reporter gene was arrhythmic and constitutively high in ll which is consistent with _PROTEIN_ mrna levels . using northern blot analysis to examine _PROTEIN_ of other genes in the _PROTEIN_ mutant we found that the photosynthetic gene _PROTEIN_ the potential clock genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and the gene _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ arrhythmically although mrna levels were transiently changed on the day . the levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrna were constitutively high whereas those of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were constitutively low . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is essential for the generation of circadian _METHOD_ and that the gene controls the _PROTEIN_ of the potential clock and genes . to further analyze _PROTEIN_ function in the arabidopsis clock we performed cloning and identified gene _GENE_ as _PROTEIN_ . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ had a nonsense mutation . the predicted _PROTEIN_ protein contained a motif that is widely observed in plant transcription _PROTEIN_ belonging to the garp family including arabidopsis response regulators such as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the garp motif contains a _LOCATION_ localization signal and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ localize in the _LOCATION_ and bind to dna in vitro through the garp motif . in _PROTEIN_ this motif has a structure . because both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cause truncation of the _PROTEIN_ protein proximal to the garp motif arrhythmia in both mutants should exhibit a phenotype . _PROTEIN_ localized in the _LOCATION_ in onion epidermal cells as demonstrated by transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusion proteins . _PROTEIN_ is therefore likely to localize in the _LOCATION_ of arabidopsis cells and function as a transcription _PROTEIN_ . neither the nor of _PROTEIN_ has a homology to known proteins . however we identified a _PROTEIN_ gene in the arabidopsis genome a putative _PROTEIN_ homolog genes in the rice genome and _PROTEIN_ sequence tags in tobacco tomato potato and pine . we examined _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under constant conditions by northern blot analysis and by bioluminescence monitoring of plants carrying a _PROTEIN_ luc reporter gene . in ll the level of _PROTEIN_ mrna in plants oscillated rhythmically in a circadian manner with peaks at subjective dusk . in _PROTEIN_ mutants in contrast the levels were arrhythmic and constitutively high . plants carrying the _PROTEIN_ luc reporter gene showed robust circadian bioluminescence _METHOD_ with a waveform the increase was rapid and the _PROTEIN_ was gradual . the period length of the rhythm was h and the phase was circadian time . in dd the level of bioluminescence of the plants _PROTEIN_ to about of the ll level within h of the light to dark transition . after h it showed robust circadian bioluminescence _METHOD_ with a longer period length than it had in ll . rhythmic _PROTEIN_ of the clock oscillator gene generates circadian oscillation and disruption of the rhythmic _PROTEIN_ abolishes multiple circadian outputs . we constructed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants carrying a _PROTEIN_ luc reporter gene and examined their bioluminescence _METHOD_ . in both ll and dd the _METHOD_ are gradually lost within four cycles and bioluminescence levels were then _PROTEIN_ constitutively at less than half the level . _PROTEIN_ also gradually caused arrhythmicity in the _METHOD_ of leaf movement and of the mrna levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ within four cycles . most clock oscillator genes are _PROTEIN_ rhythmically in a circadian manner under constant conditions and control their own _PROTEIN_ level by negative feedback . in the present study of _PROTEIN_ repressed endogenous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and disrupted its circadian _PROTEIN_ rhythm . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ an autoregulatory negative feedback loop and that oscillation of _PROTEIN_ is essential for the arabidopsis clock .
we used bioluminescence reporter strain carrying a _PROTEIN_ luc reporter gene as the strain unless otherwise indicated . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants were originally isolated as arrhythmic mutants and respectively and have the genetic background . we used homozygous plants of the mutants . they were grown on solid _METHOD_ medium at as previously described . we measured bioluminescence _METHOD_ and leaf movement _METHOD_ as previously described . light intensity was from white _METHOD_ lamps . seeds were placed in water at for days and grown on soil at under or conditions . light intensity in the light period was from white _METHOD_ lamps . we determined the flowering time by counting the number of leaves when the inflorescence was high . we crossed homozygotes of the _PROTEIN_ mutant to ler and used homozygotes from the cross for genetic mapping . we selected the homozygotes by measuring the bioluminescence in ll of plants carrying a _PROTEIN_ luc reporter gene and confirmed their phenotypes in plants . we used publicly available cleaved amplified polymorphic sequences and simple sequence length _METHOD_ as markers between and ler in tair database and single nucleotide _METHOD_ between the two strains released from the monsanto arabidopsis polymorphism collection . we examined snps by pcr amplification following direct sequencing of the genomic dna . fine mapping delimited _PROTEIN_ to a kb interval between snps and caps marker _PROTEIN_ . we sequenced the kb region containing _PROTEIN_ in the genomes of both the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants and identified the two mutations by comparing their sequences to the genomic sequences of and strains . we identified the nucleotide sequences of _PROTEIN_ cdnas from tair and _PROTEIN_ est databases and determined _PROTEIN_ gene structure by comparison with the genomic sequence . details are described in the legend for fig . . we constructed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tnos and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ tnos fusion genes in the plasmid and transferred them into onion epidermal cells by particle bombardment . after incubation at in dd we observed the localization of each _METHOD_ fusion protein with confocal laser scanning microscope . _METHOD_ tnos cassette was derived from plasmid . the _PROTEIN_ luc tnos reporter cassette consisted of an upstream region of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under accession no . the coding region of a modified firefly luciferase gene and the transcriptional terminator sequence of the agrobacterium nopaline synthase gene . the _PROTEIN_ luc tnos reporter cassette was inserted into the smai site of binary vector in the same direction as an _PROTEIN_ gene cassette giving luc . the _PROTEIN_ cassette consisted of a cauliflower mosaic virus promoter derived from and the coding region of _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ cassette was inserted just upstream of tnos in binary vector in the same direction as tnos giving _PROTEIN_ . we transferred the regions of luc and _PROTEIN_ into the genome of and strains respectively by the agrobacterium floral dip method . we selected strains containing the in a single locus as a homozygote by standard techniques and used homozygous plants as _PROTEIN_ reporter plants or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants . plants were grown on solid _METHOD_ medium containing sucrose and gelrite for days at in ll exposed to three cycles of _PROTEIN_ to synchronize the circadian clock and returned to ll . light intensity in the light period was from white _METHOD_ lamps . at or intervals we harvested ten plants of each strain in ll and immediately froze the whole plants in liquid nitrogen . we isolated total rna from the frozen plants using rneasy midi kit according to the manufacturer 's instructions . the total rna was separated on formaldehyde gels blotted on to biodyne plus _LOCATION_ hybridized with probes with according to the manufacturer 's instructions . signals from hybridized bands were detected and quantified with a analyzer _PROTEIN_ . we normalized signals against the densities of _METHOD_ brilliant rrna . probes for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were labeled with dctp as described by makino et al . . genomic dna fragments of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were labeled with dctp by the random primer method . to detect only _PROTEIN_ mrna derived from endogenous _PROTEIN_ but not from the _PROTEIN_ transgene we synthesized an rna probe from the region of endogenous _PROTEIN_ by in vitro transcription using a maxiscript kit .
