the proliferating cell _LOCATION_ antigen _PROTEIN_ functions as a sliding clamp for dna polymerase and is thus a key actor in dna replication . it is also involved in dna repair _PROTEIN_ of heterochromatic regions throughout replication cell cycle regulation and programmed cell death . identification of _PROTEIN_ partners is therefore necessary for understanding these processes . here we identify two arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ domain proteins that interact with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . a truncated _PROTEIN_ incapable of interacting with _PROTEIN_ also occurs in planta . _PROTEIN_ upregulated during the s phase is upregulated by _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ suggesting that it is required for s phase progression . the two proteins differ in their subcellular localization _PROTEIN_ has a dual localization in _LOCATION_ and in the _LOCATION_ whereas _PROTEIN_ is solely _LOCATION_ . this indicates that the two proteins may play different roles in plant cells . however overexpression of either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ causes male sterility because of the degeneration of defined cell types . taken together our results suggest that both proteins may play a role in the cell cycle or dna replication and that the activity of _PROTEIN_ may be regulated via its subcellular localization .
a yeast two hybrid screening using _PROTEIN_ as a bait allowed us to identify a tobacco cdna encoding a _PROTEIN_ domain protein . two homologues of sharing identity exist in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . they share and identity with respectively in their c terminal region . reverse transcriptase pcr allowed us to detect _PROTEIN_ of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in all tested organs _METHOD_ . comparison of the _PROTEIN_ patterns of the two genes using the genevestigator software revealed that _PROTEIN_ is very highly _PROTEIN_ in pollen . in addition both genes are upregulated in tissues where cell division is active and notably in shoot apices . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ belong to the _PROTEIN_ domain protein family that comprises at least members in arabidopsis . they also possess a plant homeo domain like the drosophila trx protein . they were named _PROTEIN_ rather than _PROTEIN_ because their _PROTEIN_ domains have significantly diverged from that of other _PROTEIN_ proteins . as stated above they were assigned to a particular class of _PROTEIN_ domain proteins together with the yeast proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ because they lack a pre _PROTEIN_ and a post _PROTEIN_ domain and because several amino acids which are crucial for the lmt activity are not conserved in these sequences . indeed the yeast _PROTEIN_ protein is found in a complex with no detectable lmt activity . other features seem to distinguish these proteins from the other arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ domain proteins . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ contain a putative _PROTEIN_ box a conserved motif found in the sequence of several _PROTEIN_ partners . it is defined by the consensus sequence q xx h xx a a where h represents hydrophobic residues a represents aromatic residues and x is any amino acid . such a motif can be found in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ amino acid sequences in the region encoded by the second exon . to determine whether the ability to bind _PROTEIN_ is a unique property of _PROTEIN_ we searched for _PROTEIN_ binding motives using the signpt software in the yeast proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as well as in all _PROTEIN_ domain proteins of arabidopsis . only three other _PROTEIN_ domain proteins from arabidopsis contain a canonical _PROTEIN_ box _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and this motif is absent from _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . furthermore analysis of _PROTEIN_ sequence tags from various plant species such as poplar sunflower potato snapdragon and even ceratopteris revealed that homologues of _PROTEIN_ are conserved in plant genomes and that all of their homologues seem to retain the canonical _PROTEIN_ box . this suggests that the ability to bind _PROTEIN_ is crucial for the function of these proteins . in addition according to several software _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is predicted to be targeted both to _LOCATION_ and to the _LOCATION_ . in contrast _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to lack the n terminal targeting peptide . nevertheless the _LOCATION_ targeting of some well known _LOCATION_ division proteins such as or is predicted with a low score by various _METHOD_ . the _LOCATION_ import of _PROTEIN_ can therefore not be excluded . before further investigation of the function of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ their ability to bind _PROTEIN_ was tested . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ can interact with both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the yeast two hybrid system . moreover an _PROTEIN_ cdna lacking the second exon _PROTEIN_ was found in data bases . it was obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center _PROTEIN_ and was a good material to confirm that the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and atpcna occurs via the _PROTEIN_ box . the truncated version of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interacts neither with _PROTEIN_ nor with _PROTEIN_ . this cdna differs from the full length cdna by only bp i.e . amino acids . thus _PROTEIN_ probably binds atpcna via the _PROTEIN_ box encoded by this short cdna sequence . the rt pcr analysis allowed us to confirm that both _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ exist in planta although the variant including the second exon is by far the most abundant . the ability of _PROTEIN_ to bind atpcna could therefore be regulated through alternative splicing in planta . proliferating cell _LOCATION_ antigen is a _LOCATION_ protein . according to bioinformatic predictions _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ can also accumulate in the _LOCATION_ . to confirm that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interact with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in plant cells bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation experiments were performed . by cell protoplasts were transformed with constructs encoding a fusion between _PROTEIN_ and the n terminal region of yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and between the whole _PROTEIN_ amino acid sequence and the c terminal region of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . as shown in figure _METHOD_ _METHOD_ could be detected in the _LOCATION_ of protoplasts co transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ can interact with _PROTEIN_ in plant cells . the same experiment was performed with the full length coding sequence of _PROTEIN_ but no _METHOD_ could be detected . this could be due to the _PROTEIN_ that in these experimental conditions _PROTEIN_ is targeted solely to _LOCATION_ and does not accumulate in the _LOCATION_ where it could interact with atpcna . to test this we used a truncated version of the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence where we deleted the first bp encoding the chloroplast targeting peptide _PROTEIN_ . when protoplasts were co transformed with _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ could be detected in their _LOCATION_ . the same results were obtained with _PROTEIN_ suggesting that all combinations can occur in planta . these results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ can bind atpcna in living plant cells and that the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ is probably regulated via the presence/absence of its chloroplast targeting sequence . to ascertain whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ accumulate in different subcellular compartments their localization was studied in planta . bioinformatic analysis suggests that _PROTEIN_ is targeted both to the _LOCATION_ and to _LOCATION_ . the localization of the protein might depend on the cell type or organ and was therefore studied in planta . to this end a construct encoding a translational fusion between _PROTEIN_ and green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of a promoter was introduced into plants . green _METHOD_ protein could be detected in the _LOCATION_ in roots and in anthers and leaves but in these two organs _METHOD_ accumulated only in stomata guard cells . green _METHOD_ protein was also detected in _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ cells but not in leaf cells . moreover _METHOD_ was not evenly distributed in the chloroplast stroma . higher concentrations of the fusion protein were found at the periphery of the organelle . although the plants we analysed displayed a high _PROTEIN_ of the construct at the transcriptional level we were unable to detect _METHOD_ in many cell types including mesophyll cells and meristematic cells . this suggests that post translational _METHOD_ regulate the abundance of _PROTEIN_ in these cell types either by inhibiting the translation of the protein or by degrading it . accumulation of _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ and in _LOCATION_ could be observed in at least three independent lines for each cell type _PROTEIN_ can thus be targeted to these two cellular compartments . both localizations were observed within a given plant but we could never observe _METHOD_ in _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ within the same cell . this dual localization of _PROTEIN_ is intriguing but not unique . at least three other plant proteins have been reported to accumulate both in _LOCATION_ and in the _LOCATION_ and it is likely that more such proteins are to be found as several yeast proteins can accumulate both in mitochondria and in the _LOCATION_ . several _METHOD_ have been described to allow dual localization of a single protein both in yeast and plants including alternative transcription initiation alternative splicing alternative translation initiation and more rarely post translational modification . reverse transcriptase pcr did not allow us to isolate transcripts with different length in their region . in addition the _PROTEIN_ mrna sequence contains several in frame initiation codons one of them corresponding to the last codon of the putative chloroplast targeting sequence . citation have identified the optimal context sequence of the translation initiation codon in plants . a/g at position and gc at position are important both in tobacco and in maize . aug codons situated at the beginning and at the end of the chloroplast targeting sequence of _PROTEIN_ meet these criteria . the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ is therefore likely to be modulated by alternative translation initiation but could also be modulated by post translational modifications or via the binding to other _PROTEIN_ . indeed this dual localization may be a regulatory mechanism modulating the ability of _PROTEIN_ to bind _PROTEIN_ . similar to the transcription _PROTEIN_ iib _PROTEIN_ related protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ could accumulate at the periphery of chloroplasts and be relocated to the _LOCATION_ under certain conditions . under such a hypothesis its molecular function may relate to chromatin remodelling because of its _PROTEIN_ domain but also to direct cell cycle regulation via binding to _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ that _PROTEIN_ is predicted to be a stromal protein argues against such a hypothesis as proteins can not come out of chloroplasts once they have entered the organelle . however _PROTEIN_ is also predicted by the psort software to be a stromal protein and this model would be consistent with the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at the periphery of chloroplasts . transient _PROTEIN_ experiments revealed that _PROTEIN_ is targeted only to the _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ can thus both be targeted to the _LOCATION_ but _PROTEIN_ can also accumulate in chloroplasts at least in some cell types suggesting that the two proteins may fulfil distinct functions in separated cellular compartments . the sub cellular localization of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is compatible with an interaction with _PROTEIN_ which is a _LOCATION_ protein and supports the hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may be involved in cell cycle regulation . to test this we first determined whether the _PROTEIN_ of these two genes is higher in proliferating cells as suggested by genevestigator and whether their _PROTEIN_ is cell cycle regulated . to gain further insight into the pattern of _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ its whole genomic sequence including its promoter but lacking its untranslated region was cloned in frame with _METHOD_ and introduced into plants . we then specifically searched for _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ overexpressers _PROTEIN_ . roots of day old plantlets were observed under a confocal microscope . as shown in figure _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected solely in the _LOCATION_ of root tip cells demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ accumulates in the _LOCATION_ of cells in planta . in addition the protein accumulates in root _METHOD_ but not in differentiated root cells consistent with the upregulation of _PROTEIN_ in actively dividing cells . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ could also be observed in the _LOCATION_ of young leaf cells but never in chloroplasts confirming that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ differ in their subcellular localization . these results also suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may differ in their _PROTEIN_ pattern . indeed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to be restricted to proliferating cells whereas _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ could only be observed in differentiated cells _PROTEIN_ . this could be due to completely different _PROTEIN_ patterns of the two proteins but this would not be consistent with the _PROTEIN_ that both genes are upregulated in proliferating cells according to genevestigator . accumulation of _PROTEIN_ in differentiated cells could be due to the _PROTEIN_ that we used a promoter forcing _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in cells where the gene is not normally _PROTEIN_ . in proliferating cells the protein may be _PROTEIN_ but its half life could be short preventing us from observing accumulation of _METHOD_ . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are upregulated in proliferating cells their regulation during the cell cycle was investigated . northern blot analysis indeed allowed us to observe that _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and to a lesser extent _PROTEIN_ is raised in arabidopsis cells re entering the cell cycle after sucrose starvation or aphidicolin block . the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was therefore monitored in synchronized arabidopsis cells . histone was used as a marker for the _PROTEIN_ s phase and as a marker for the _PROTEIN_ m phase . because _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are hardly detectable by northern blot their _PROTEIN_ level was monitored by rt pcr . _PROTEIN_ of all genes was quantified using the quantity one analysis software and normalized using actin _PROTEIN_ as a constitutive control . as shown in figure cells were blocked in s phase as demonstrated by the high level of histone mrna before aphidicolin block release . these cells progressed rapidly through the cell cycle entered _PROTEIN_ m about h after aphidicolin wash and re entered _PROTEIN_ s h after aphidicolin wash . _PROTEIN_ of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was high in blocked cells _PROTEIN_ during _PROTEIN_ and m phases and was maximal in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ s suggesting that these genes are _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ at the _PROTEIN_ s transition . similar results were obtained twice by independent synchronization experiments . the _PROTEIN_ window of _PROTEIN_ was much broader than that of _PROTEIN_ suggesting its cell cycle regulation is not as strict and that post translational _METHOD_ may also be involved . to determine whether the abundance of the _PROTEIN_ protein varied during the cell cycle another synchronization experiment was performed proteins were extracted from the synchronized cells and a western blot analysis was conducted . _PROTEIN_ accumulated at higher levels h after aphidicolin release during s phase as shown by the simultaneous accumulation of histone mrna . this experiment also allowed us to check that the results obtained for _PROTEIN_ were reproducible . thus _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are both cell cycle regulated but this regulation involves distinct _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is induced in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and early s whereas _PROTEIN_ protein accumulates _PROTEIN_ supporting the hypothesis that these proteins function in the onset and/or progression of the s phase . _PROTEIN_ is upregulated during _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the s phase . its promoter contains three binding sites and _PROTEIN_ overexpressers have been shown to accumulate more _PROTEIN_ mrna . although the promoters of several other genes of the _PROTEIN_ domain family contain putative binding sites _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are the only ones to be upregulated in _PROTEIN_ suggesting that their function is related to the cell cycle . reverse transcriptase pcr analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ is up regulated not only in _PROTEIN_ oe but also in _PROTEIN_ . moreover _PROTEIN_ accumulates more _PROTEIN_ protein than the wild type . _PROTEIN_ could therefore be a target of either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . several experiments were performed to investigate the regulation of _PROTEIN_ by proteins . first we tested the ability of and _PROTEIN_ to transactivate _PROTEIN_ in transient _PROTEIN_ experiments . to this end we took advantage of the translational fusion between the whole _PROTEIN_ genomic sequence and _METHOD_ . by protoplasts were transformed with this construct alone or co transformed with this construct and either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ under the control of a promoter . these _PROTEIN_ constructs have been previously shown to activate a gus reporter gene placed under the control of six consecutive canonical cis elements . no _METHOD_ was detected in by cells when they were transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ alone or with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ . by contrast _METHOD_ labelled _LOCATION_ could be observed when they were transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ . some of these _LOCATION_ appeared speckled suggesting that the protein is associated with chromatin . we have shown previously that _PROTEIN_ is a more potent activator than _PROTEIN_ under these conditions suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is more efficiently upregulated by _PROTEIN_ than by _PROTEIN_ . to verify whether these sites were actually able to bind activating _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ we applied the chromatin immunoprecipitation _PROTEIN_ technique using polyclonal antibodies against which recognize _PROTEIN_ and to a lesser extent _PROTEIN_ . as a positive control in order to assess the specificity of _PROTEIN_ the pcr reaction was performed on immunoprecipitated genomic fragments using primers specific for and _PROTEIN_ which are well known responsive genes . then to rule out unspecific interactions pcr was also carried out using primers specific for the non responsive gene encoding glutamate dehydrogenase . in addition a mock reaction to which no antibodies were added was used as a negative control . as shown in figure activating can indeed bind this promoter . taken together these results strongly suggest that _PROTEIN_ is a direct target of _PROTEIN_ although we can not rule out the possibility that it may also be a direct target of other _PROTEIN_ . by contrast the _PROTEIN_ promoter does not contain any binding site and the abundance of _PROTEIN_ mrna is not modified in or _PROTEIN_ overexpressers . in yeast and animals several chromatin remodelling and chromatin assembly _PROTEIN_ bind to _PROTEIN_ during dna replication . these proteins are involved either in the _PROTEIN_ of heterochromatic regions after dna replication or in chromatin remodelling at the origins of replication . as _PROTEIN_ harbours a _PROTEIN_ domain one likely function would be to participate in chromatin remodelling . as stated above it is probably not an active lmt . however the yeast _PROTEIN_ protein has been shown to be involved in chromatin remodelling although it is not a lmt . indeed it is associated with histone deacetylases . histone deacetylation similarly to histone or dna methylation promotes the transition from euchromatin to heterochromatin . _PROTEIN_ could like its yeast homologue be involved in the regulation of gene _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is cell cycle regulated possibly via the _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ it can interact with _PROTEIN_ and its putative yeast homologue is found in a complex with histone deacetylases . this protein is therefore be a good candidate to play a role in the s phase dependent modification of histones . taken together our results strongly suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are involved in cell cycle regulation . to gain further insight into their exact role in plants we analysed the phenotype of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ overexpressers . _PROTEIN_ overexpressers _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the full length coding region of the gene under the control of a promoter were obtained and the phenotype of independent transformants was analysed . about of the population was sterile . seeds could be obtained by pollinating the plants with wild type pollen showing that they are only male sterile . efficient _PROTEIN_ of the construct in these plants was monitored by northern blot analysis . lines and were used for further analysis . alexander staining allowed us to assess the viability of the pollen grains . as shown in figure anthers contained few pollen grains many of which appeared crumpled green and empty . diamidino phenylindole staining of anthers at various stages revealed that meiosis occurred normally in these plants . figure shows that male gametophytes of _PROTEIN_ undergo the two pollinic mitoses as they appear to contain two reproductive and a vegetative _LOCATION_ . at this stage cell death occurs as shown by the swelling and fragmentation of the _LOCATION_ . at _PROTEIN_ stages the pollen grains are totally empty and do not contain dna . interestingly in wild type plants the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is maximal in pollen grains according to genevestigator data . the overexpression of _PROTEIN_ may therefore specifically affect pollen grains because it plays a major role in this cell type or because it is especially abundant in these cells . as _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to physiologically accumulate in developing pollen it is puzzling that its overexpression should result in pollen degeneration . however overexpression of positive regulators of the cell cycle such as _PROTEIN_ has been shown to induce cell death in specific cell types . _PROTEIN_ may therefore function to promote the proliferation of microspore mother cells or pollinic mitosis . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is not restricted to developing pollen but can be detected in all plant organs . the protein is therefore likely to take part in various aspects of plant physiology . to investigate the function of _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis plants were transformed with a construct allowing _PROTEIN_ of an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion under the control of a promoter . although _PROTEIN_ resistant plants could be obtained _METHOD_ could never be observed in the plants suggesting that strong overexpression of the construct was lethal . we therefore analysed the phenotype of plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ under the control of its own promoter _PROTEIN_ . amongst independent lines about were sterile with short siliques containing one to two seeds . northern blot analysis allowed us to check that these plants efficiently _PROTEIN_ the construct . because we used _PROTEIN_ s own promoter compensatory _METHOD_ may be at work that would _PROTEIN_ a constant overall mrna level for _PROTEIN_ . to make sure that the analysed plants actually overexpressed _PROTEIN_ rt pcr analysis was performed using _PROTEIN_ specific primers this allowed us to check that _PROTEIN_ of our construct did result in overexpression of the gene . lines and were used for further characterization . when sterile plants were pollinated with wild type pollen all the crosses resulted in the formation of normal siliques demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ is female fertile . nevertheless the cause of the male sterility was different from what was observed in _PROTEIN_ no pollen could be observed on the stigma of mature flowers in _PROTEIN_ . the pollen was viable as seeds could be obtained by pollinating plants with pollen extracted from their own anthers . even at _PROTEIN_ stages the pollen grains remained in the anthers suggesting that the sterility of _PROTEIN_ is due to an impairment of anther dehiscence . to investigate the cause of this alteration of anther maturation anthers of the wild type and _PROTEIN_ were observed under ultraviolet illumination . wild type anthers displayed the characteristic net like _METHOD_ that indicates the presence of lignified secondary walls . this _METHOD_ was dramatically reduced in _PROTEIN_ . microscopic observation of flower sections was therefore performed . in the wild type endothecium is a cell type crucial to dehiscence . the cell wall of these cells is _PROTEIN_ by fibrous deposition . when the stomium cells have degenerated thereby opening the anther some endothecium cells also die but their cell wall remains . when anthers dehydrate the endothecium shrinks unevenly because of its _PROTEIN_ cell wall and pulls both sides of the anther apart thereby releasing pollen grains . in _PROTEIN_ the layer of cells was totally absent or drastically reduced . the stomium degenerated properly but as the endothecium was absent pollen grains remained in the anther . at younger stages endothecium was clearly observed in _PROTEIN_ showing that this phenotype was not due to the absence of this cell layer but to its disappearance and incorrect differentiation during anther development . it was not clear however whether differentiation failed to occur or cells entered programmed cell death prematurely . reactive oxygen species are known to play a role in pcd and recently citation have shown that by cells undergoing pcd produce o. anthers of the wild type and _PROTEIN_ were therefore coloured with nbt a molecule that allows the detection of o . in the wild type o production was high in all anther tissues at the tetrad stage and became restricted to a region near the connective once pollen grains were mature . by contrast anthers of _PROTEIN_ were never stained by nbt . this result suggests that pcd is not enhanced in _PROTEIN_ . as endothecium is present in young anthers of _PROTEIN_ their phenotype is not due to a missed cell division overexpression of _PROTEIN_ rather _METHOD_ to interfere with cell differentiation . one possible explanation would be that _PROTEIN_ is a positive regulator of cell division and that its overexpression _PROTEIN_ endothecium cells in an undifferentiated state . citation have shown that pcd is an important aspect of cell differentiation during anther development and affects endothecium although the cells are still alive when anthers dehisce . an inhibition of cell differentiation could thus also account for the reduced ros production in _PROTEIN_ . as the cell wall of endothecium cells fails to _PROTEIN_ the dehydration of the anther and subsequent cell death would result in the complete disappearance of this cell layer . overexpression of several cell cycle genes involved in the positive regulation of the _PROTEIN_ s transition _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ results in the same phenotype . this observation strongly supports the hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ may also be a positive regulator of the _PROTEIN_ s transition . _PROTEIN_ overexpression affects only a very defined cell type . this is in sharp contrast with its ubiquitous _PROTEIN_ pattern its high _PROTEIN_ level in dividing cells and its ability to bind atpcna that has very general functions . the notable effect on endothecium in no way precludes a more general function of _PROTEIN_ at the level of cell cycle progression .
