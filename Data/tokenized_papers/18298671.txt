_PROTEIN_ a protein phosphatase is a key component of aba signal transduction in arabidopsis that regulates numerous aba responses such as stomatal closure seed germination and inhibition of vegetative growth . the _PROTEIN_ mutation so far the only characterized dominant allele for _PROTEIN_ impairs aba responsitivity in both seeds and vegetative tissues . the site of action of _PROTEIN_ is unknown . we show that there is an essential requirement for _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ to confer insensitivity towards aba responses . transient analyses in protoplasts revealed a strict dependence of wild type _PROTEIN_ and mutant _PROTEIN_ on a functional _LOCATION_ localization sequence for regulating aba dependent gene _PROTEIN_ . arabidopsis lines with ectopic _PROTEIN_ of various _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ corroborated the necessity of a functional nls to control aba sensitivity . disruption of the nls function in _PROTEIN_ rescued aba controlled gene transcription to wild type levels but also attenuated _PROTEIN_ conferred insensitivity towards aba during seed germination root growth and stomatal movement . the mutation in the _PROTEIN_ resulted in a preferential accumulation of the protein in the _LOCATION_ . application of a proteosomal inhibitor led to both a preferential _LOCATION_ accumulation of _PROTEIN_ and an enhancement of _PROTEIN_ dependent inhibitory action on the aba response . thus _PROTEIN_ acts as a hypermorphic allele and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ sensitivity towards aba in the _LOCATION_ .
_PROTEIN_ interaction with the transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ implied a _LOCATION_ localization of the _PROTEIN_ . sequence analysis of _PROTEIN_ revealed a short region enriched in basic amino acids sharing similarity to the monopartite nls of simian virus large t antigen which has known functionality in plants . the predicted nls of _PROTEIN_ is located at the very end of the _PROTEIN_ terminal domain of the _PROTEIN_ . amino terminal _METHOD_ fusions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and of nls deleted versions were _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts to examine a possible nls function . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ predominantly accumulated in the _LOCATION_ . deletion of the nls led to a redistribution of the proteins between the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ compartments similar to the _METHOD_ control . to examine whether disruption of nls function rather than mere _PROTEIN_ terminal truncation of the _PROTEIN_ yielded the change in subcellular distribution four lysine and arginine residues of the nls were mutated into asparagine and glutamine residues _PROTEIN_ with the aim of inactivating the nls of both wild type and mutant _PROTEIN_ . the basic amino acid residues of nls are critical for function and substitution for neutral amino acid residues abrogates _LOCATION_ import . the cellular localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was indistinguishable from the _METHOD_ control . in addition we examined whether the nls of simian virus large t antigen is capable of rescuing the _LOCATION_ compartmentation of _PROTEIN_ . the _METHOD_ signal of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ clearly accumulated in the _LOCATION_ of arabidopsis protoplasts . the analysis provides strong evidence for a nls dependent import of the _PROTEIN_ into the _LOCATION_ . next we addressed whether the capacity of _PROTEIN_ to enter the _LOCATION_ affects aba signal transduction . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are known to block aba inducible gene _PROTEIN_ when they are ectopically _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts of maize or arabidopsis . to monitor _PROTEIN_ action on the aba signal pathway arabidopsis protoplasts were transfected with various _PROTEIN_ effector genes and an aba dependent reporter construct . aliquots of the transfected sample were analysed for their aba response after incubation in the presence and absence of aba by normalizing the reporter _PROTEIN_ to gus activity that was generated by co transfection of a constitutively _PROTEIN_ gus cassette . in the absence of effectors aba exposure of the mesophyll protoplasts resulted in an approximately fold increase of reporter activity . this increase was not affected by transfection of the empty effector cassette . however effector cassettes that provide _PROTEIN_ of either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ led to a clear and dose dependent inhibition of the aba response . the response to aba was essentially _LOCATION_ by transfection with of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plasmid resulting in a residual activity of above control levels . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was less effective in downregulating aba mediated reporter _PROTEIN_ . a twofold inhibition of the response required about ng of the _PROTEIN_ effector construct and approximately threefold lower quantities of the corresponding _PROTEIN_ plasmid . these differences in effectiveness were consistently observed in the analyses carried out independently and with different plasmid preparations and hence reflect a functional consequence of the single nucleotide exchange within the _PROTEIN_ gene . functional inactivation of the nls completely abolished the negative regulation exerted by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ on aba signalling . a complete loss of _PROTEIN_ action was also observed by _PROTEIN_ of a phosphatase non active form of _PROTEIN_ . we conclude that the _LOCATION_ localization of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to be required to negatively regulate aba signalling in protoplasts . alternatively protein stability of the nls mutated _PROTEIN_ is severely compromised . we then sought to establish whether the nls mutated _PROTEIN_ protein was unstable . unfortunately polyclonal antibodies that were raised against _PROTEIN_ crossreacted with the homologous _PROTEIN_ and might even have recognized other related _PROTEIN_ . therefore we decided to tag the different _PROTEIN_ with gus and determine whether the stability of the fusion proteins was affected by the _PROTEIN_ terminal modifications . arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts were transfected with the corresponding effector plasmids . subsequently gus activity was determined and normalized to the _PROTEIN_ of a transfected driven luc control gene . there was no major difference in reporter activity irrespective of the fused _PROTEIN_ version . the fusion proteins were still functional to block aba signalling albeit with a reduced efficacy compared with the non fused _METHOD_ . again the _PROTEIN_ fusion was less inhibitory than the _PROTEIN_ version . taken together _PROTEIN_ stability was not detectably affected by the nls modification . similarly to the results obtained with gus fusions _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ effectors inhibited aba dependent reporter _PROTEIN_ . the reporter fusion impaired the efficiency of the effectors to act on aba signalling to some extent . deletion of the nls abrogated the action of _PROTEIN_ on aba signalling whereas substitution of the endogenous nls with the nls of simian virus large t antigen rescued the response . furthermore regulation of the aba response by ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was similar irrespective of _PROTEIN_ the effector under the control of the promoter or promoter . we conclude from these experiments that the nls modification does not impact protein stability and that the tagged _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ versions are still functional albeit at a reduced level . tagging the _PROTEIN_ with gus or _METHOD_ reduced its ability to inhibit aba signalling . the _PROTEIN_ fusions still blocked the aba mediated response in protoplasts although less so than the _PROTEIN_ versions whereas deletion or mutation of the nls abolished the inhibitory action . to evaluate the contribution of the _PROTEIN_ nls domain on other aba responses in plants transgenic arabidopsis lines were generated _PROTEIN_ either gus or _METHOD_ fused to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ gus fusions were recovered and seeds of homozygous lines were analysed with respect to aba mediated inhibition of germination by scoring radicle emergence after days of incubation in the presence of exogenous aba . the _PROTEIN_ of gus _PROTEIN_ resulted in a strong change in aba sensitivity of the seed material . control seeds transformed with the empty gus cassette were fully inhibited from germinating in the presence of aba . in contrast gus _PROTEIN_ seeds revealed a germination efficiency that was greater than even in the presence of aba which is consistent with an inhibitory action of the effector protein on the aba response . the marked aba insensitivity mediated by _PROTEIN_ was entirely lost however in seeds _PROTEIN_ the nls deficient version . the germination rate was indistinguishable from that of control seeds . _PROTEIN_ of both _PROTEIN_ gus and the fusion protein with deleted nls had no significant effect on aba dependent seed germination . the requirement for a functional nls domain for conferring aba insensitivity by _PROTEIN_ gus was corroborated by analysis of aba mediated inhibition of root expansion . in the presence of high levels of aba root elongation of _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ seedlings was reduced by approximately compared with non exposed seedlings . at the same aba level the transgenic line _PROTEIN_ the nls deleted _PROTEIN_ was inhibited by > and was comparable with the gus control and the _PROTEIN_ gus line . aba insensitivity of stomatal responses leads to a wilting phenotype characterized by increased water loss of detached leaves . to analyse stomatal responses water loss was determined from leaves of comparable size and age that were obtained from the different transgenic arabidopsis lines . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and its _PROTEIN_ terminally truncated version did not affect stomatal closure . leaves _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gus revealed a twofold enhanced water loss relative to the leaves of the control line or the line _PROTEIN_ the nls deficient _PROTEIN_ . the increased water loss of the _PROTEIN_ line resulted in a clearly visible wilting phenotype . arabidopsis lines _PROTEIN_ the corresponding _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions yielded similar results . aba insensitive germination was observed in seed material _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the control of either the or the promoter whereas _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ had no effect on aba responsiveness during germination . the phenotypes of the transgenic lines are consistent with the previous analysis in protoplasts which revealed a requirement for a functional nls domain in the _PROTEIN_ to mediate insensitivity towards aba responses . in variance to the analysis in protoplasts _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ gus proteins did not significantly alter the aba response of arabidopsis plantlets . the necessity for _LOCATION_ localization of the _PROTEIN_ to mediate the inhibitory effect prompted us to analyse in more detail the intracellular localization of the fusion proteins in the transgenic lines . the cytological analysis of guard and root cells revealed a predominance of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ compared with the non fused _METHOD_ control which was similar to the previous analyses in protoplasts . in contrast the _METHOD_ signal of the non fused _METHOD_ marker was clearly shifted to the _LOCATION_ compartment and the shift was even more pronounced with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the _PROTEIN_ tagged proteins were detected throughout the seedling similar to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ under control of the promoter by confocal laser scanning microscopy . there was a single difference in the root tip . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was clearly detected in the _PROTEIN_ root cap and columella cells whereas the meristematic zone of the root tip yielded a much lower signal . the _METHOD_ control under the same promoter showed an even _PROTEIN_ pattern in both the cap and meristematic zone of the root . close ups of the samples revealed a subcellular distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ consistent with a _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ compartmentation . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ preferentially accumulated in the _LOCATION_ whereas _PROTEIN_ with deleted nls yielded an intracellular distribution resembling _PROTEIN_ . an intracellular relocation of abi _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was not observed in response to aba . the analyses indicate an intracellular distribution of tagged _PROTEIN_ that is different from _PROTEIN_ in that the mutant protein was primarily detected in the _LOCATION_ . comparison of the _METHOD_ signal obtained with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion and the _METHOD_ control indicate an efficient degradation or export of the fusion proteins from the meristematic zone . to address whether a proteosomal pathway operates in the turnover of the _PROTEIN_ the proteosomal inhibitor was administered to arabidopsis seedlings . inhibitor application did not stabilize the _METHOD_ signal of the fusion proteins in the meristem . it did however affect the _LOCATION_ compartmentation of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ now localized preferentially to the _LOCATION_ and the subcellular distribution pattern resembled more that of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ whereas the proteosomal inhibitor had little effect on the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ . we examined the effect of on both _PROTEIN_ controlled reporter _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ stability in transient _PROTEIN_ analyses . arabidopsis protoplasts transfected with effector constructs revealed a marked stimulation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ inhibitory action on aba signalling in the presence of the proteosomal inhibitor . the fold induction of reporter _PROTEIN_ by aba was little affected by the proteosomal inhibitor . in the presence of protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed an approximately twofold enhanced reduction of aba responsive reporter _PROTEIN_ resulting in _PROTEIN_ levels of between one and twofold of the non induced control . western blot analysis revealed no significant change in the protein abundance of differently tagged _PROTEIN_ proteins . aba signalling re addresses gene _PROTEIN_ and aba induced transcripts are deregulated in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . we wanted to know whether the nls function of _PROTEIN_ affects aba induced gene transcription . therefore we isolated rna from seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fused to either gus or _METHOD_ in addition to seedlings of the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ mutant . genes such as the dehydrin _PROTEIN_ the desiccation responsive gene _PROTEIN_ and the homeobox leucine zipper protein _PROTEIN_ failed to respond towards aba in _PROTEIN_ and were selected for analysis . transcript abundance of these aba inducible genes was analysed in response to aba . an impaired aba mediated induction in the _PROTEIN_ mutant and also in the _PROTEIN_ fusion protein _PROTEIN_ plants could be observed by semiquantitative rt pcr analysis . real time rt pcr analysis of aba induced _PROTEIN_ transcripts confirmed the finding . inhibition of aba dependent gene induction was less effective in the _PROTEIN_ fusion _PROTEIN_ lines compared with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants similar to the previous transient and stable _PROTEIN_ analyses . no significant differences in aba dependent gene regulation were observed between the _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ seedlings and the wild type .
