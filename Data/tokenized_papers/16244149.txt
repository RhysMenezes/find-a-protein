programmed cell death developmental senescence and responses to pathogens are linked through complex genetic controls that are influenced by redox regulation . here we show that the arabidopsis low vitamin c mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which have between and of wild type ascorbic acid exhibit microlesions _PROTEIN_ pathogenesis related proteins and have enhanced basal resistance against infections caused by pseudomonas syringae . the mutants have a delayed senescence phenotype with smaller leaf cells than the wild type at maturity . the vtc leaves have more glutathione than the wild type with higher ratios of reduced glutathione to glutathione disulfide . _PROTEIN_ of green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fused to the nonexpressor of pr protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was used to detect the presence of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ of transformed plants . _METHOD_ was observed in the _LOCATION_ of to week old _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants but not in the _LOCATION_ of transformed _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ wild type plants at any developmental stage . the absence of senescence associated gene _PROTEIN_ mrna at the time when constitutive cell death and basal resistance were detected _METHOD_ that elaboration of innate immune responses in vtc plants does not result from activation of early senescence . moreover sensitive genes are not induced at the time of systemic acquired resistance execution . these results demonstrate that ascorbic acid abundance modifies the threshold for activation of plant innate defense responses via redox _METHOD_ that are independent of the natural senescence program .
in this study the columbia wild type and the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants were grown in a h photoperiod in controlled environment chambers with filtered air to remove atmospheric ozone . in these conditions the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants were smaller at equivalent stages in development than wild type plants . this phenotype was clearly evidenced at weeks and was _PROTEIN_ throughout the plant growth cycle . as shown in table i the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ rosettes accumulate _METHOD_ at a much slower rate than the wild type . the _PROTEIN_ leaves had about less aa than the wild type throughout development . the _PROTEIN_ mutants studied here had even lower leaf aa content for most of the growing period with leaf aa reaching maximum values of about of those of the wild type at weeks . in addition the _PROTEIN_ leaves had to times more glutathione than the wild type . moreover the gsh to gssg ratios of _PROTEIN_ rosette leaves were almost double those measured in the wild type at all stages of development . the _PROTEIN_ rosette leaves also tended to have more leaf glutathione than the wild type with much higher gsh to gssg ratios _PROTEIN_ in rosette development . wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ leaves had similar amounts of chlorophyll and leaf protein at equivalent time points in the growth phase up to weeks of growth . thereafter leaf chlorophyll and soluble protein declined in wild type plants but in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ they remained at similar values to those observed at weeks . on the other hand the _PROTEIN_ plants were delayed in flowering compared to the wild type as did _PROTEIN_ . together these features show that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ rosettes senesce _PROTEIN_ than the wild type leaves . comparative developmental changes in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and wild type shoot _METHOD_ leaf antioxidants chlorophyll and soluble protein fw fresh weight . macroscopic spontaneous lesions were not observed in naive _PROTEIN_ leaves from plants grown on either short or long days but a few whole chlorotic leaves per plant appeared after weeks and these by eye might easily be mistaken for a symptom of senescence . however in contrast to col rosette leaves we consistently detected the presence of individual dead cells early in the development of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ rosette leaves at the microscopic level . small foci of collapsed cells were found all over the leaf surface and preferentially in the mesophyll layer of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ leaves . by weeks the areas of dead cells had expanded in _PROTEIN_ leaves to form larger foci with clear patches of dead cells detectable by _METHOD_ or lactophenol blue staining . even the young _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ rosettes had a small number of dead cells as detected by _METHOD_ or lactophenol blue staining . individual dead cells were also detected in wild type leaves but their appearance was delayed compared to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . to evaluate how _PROTEIN_ controls cell death expansion once it is initiated by an exogenous stimulus we _PROTEIN_ leaf tissues with high doses of the biotrophic bacterium p. syringae pv tomato . this virulent pathogen proliferates in the intercellular spaces of leaf tissues of naive wild type plants causing disease with spreading chlorotic lesions . however proliferation is restricted when plants orchestrate sar . we monitored the development of pathogen induced lesions in week old wild type and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants infiltrated with a high titer of bacteria . large patches of necrotic tissue were evident d postinfection in inoculated wild type leaves while only a few small groups of dead cells were found in inoculated _PROTEIN_ tissues . thus _PROTEIN_ mutation does not lead to cell death propagation once it is initiated by pst inoculation . like _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ leaves exhibited individual collapsed cells in the young rosettes . spontaneous cell death is therefore more prolific in _PROTEIN_ than _PROTEIN_ leaves whereas cell death patches were more abundant in _PROTEIN_ leaves in which aa content is much lower than _PROTEIN_ at the and week stages . individual dead cells were also detected in wild type leaves but their appearance was delayed compared to _PROTEIN_ . four days after pst inoculation typical disease _METHOD_ were observed in wild type leaves while little chlorosis was detected in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ leaves . we quantified bacterial growth in planta in wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ infected tissues and observed that both mutations conferred the ability to restrict pst proliferation by fold and fold respectively over wild type levels . similar protection is conferred by biological or chemical treatments activating sar in wild type plants . the level of basal resistance was measured every to weeks during the development of naive wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants . enhanced levels of basal resistance were clearly detectable in _PROTEIN_ plants at to weeks . by week both mutants displayed constitutive _PROTEIN_ of pr genes . however neither vtc mutants nor wild type plants displayed substantial constitutive _PROTEIN_ of the antioxidant glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ gene at this time . pr gene _PROTEIN_ was first detected in naive _PROTEIN_ plants after weeks of growth and was clearly evident by week . in contrast pr _PROTEIN_ was active only at the time of senescence in wild type plants . neither col nor _PROTEIN_ plants showed _PROTEIN_ of the senescence marker gene senescence associated gene _PROTEIN_ during the developmental period in which leaves were analyzed in these experiments . the absence of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the conclusion drawn from the enhanced duration of levels of high protein and chlorophyll that _PROTEIN_ rosettes do not develop faster or senesce earlier than the wild type plants . the mature _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ leaves had the same numbers of cells as the wild type but they were smaller . the _PROTEIN_ leaf cells stopped growing early in development at about week . transgenic wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fused to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were constructed and the _METHOD_ profile was assessed throughout the development of homozygous transformed plants . the amount of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ observed in the _LOCATION_ of mesophyll or epidermal cells was very low in all conditions . however the stomatal guard cells of all genotypes always showed _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ as observed by high _METHOD_ as reported previously . when the _METHOD_ images are overlaid bright field images of the cells then _LOCATION_ localization of the _METHOD_ spots within the guard cell pairs is evident . a higher resolution image of an individual stomatal guard cell pair is shown in the inset to figure to clearly illustrate this point . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was not detected in the _LOCATION_ of unchallenged mesophyll or epidermal cells of transgenic col plants at any stage of development . however _METHOD_ _METHOD_ accumulated in the _LOCATION_ of transgenic col plants following the application of sa . similarly _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was not accumulated in the _LOCATION_ of unchallenged mesophyll or epidermal cells of transgenic _PROTEIN_ rosettes prior to the week stage . thereafter however _METHOD_ increased in the _LOCATION_ of transgenic _PROTEIN_ rosettes becoming increasingly intense at weeks and beyond .
seeds of the wild type arabidopsis and the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants were obtained from the nottingham arabidopsis stock centre and from nick smirnoff . these plants were grown in a controlled environment chamber essentially as described previously . plants were grown for weeks at under low light with a h photoperiod and humidity . the air in the chamber was filtered to remove atmospheric ozone and with strict hygiene . whole rosettes were harvested in the growth chamber and _METHOD_ recorded . extraction and assay of aa glutathione protein and chlorophyll were performed as described previously . the virulent pseudomonas syringae pv tomato strain was grown overnight in king 's b medium with tetracycline and rifampicine and bacterial suspensions were washed twice in mm diluted to appropriate concentrations and used for infiltration into fully expanded leaves at two sites on the abaxial surface as previously described . for bacterial growth curves two leaf discs were cut around the pst inoculation sites from each leaf . discs from different inoculated leaves were pooled at each time point and homogenized in mm to liberate the bacteria . serial dilutions of the homogenates were plated on king 's b medium supplemented with tetracycline and rifampicine . colonies on the plates were counted after incubation at for h. total rna was prepared for rna gel blot hybridization analysis by use of standard protocols as described previously . arabidopsis probe templates were used for detection of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pr pr and pr transcripts . competent agrobacterium tumefaciens were prepared using the protocol of citation . arabidopsis plants were transformed with agrobacterium containing the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct using a simple dip transformation technique . primary transformed seedlings were selected on murashige and skoog agar plates containing kanamycin . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in leaves _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ reporter constructs was determined using a zeiss axiophot microscope . leaf samples were mounted in water and illuminated using an excitation and emission wavelength of and nm respectively and viewed using the appropriate filters _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . leaf sections were fixed and embedded in spurr 's medium as described by citation . semithin sections were stained with toluidine blue and examined with a leica dmr light microscope . quantitative determinations were developed using an imaging analysis leica as described previously by citation . dead cells were identified using lactophenol blue staining followed by destaining in saturated chloral hydrate as previously described . leaves were then mounted on microscopic slides in glycerol and analyzed by bright field or blue light incident _METHOD_ microscopy . numbers of dead cells per leaf were counted and independent measurements were made per time point . _METHOD_ detection was performed as described previously .
