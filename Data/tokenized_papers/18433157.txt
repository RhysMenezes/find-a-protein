an estimated one third of all proteins in higher eukaryotes are regulated by phosphorylation by protein kinases . although plant genomes encode more than pks the substrates of only a small fraction of these kinases are known . by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of peptides from cytoplasmic and _LOCATION_ enriched fractions we determined in vivo phosphorylation sites in arabidopsis proteins . among different pks were phosphorylated in their activation loops suggesting that they were in their active state . immunoblotting and mutational analysis confirmed a tyrosine phosphorylation site in the activation loop of a like kinase . analysis of phosphorylation motifs in the substrates suggested links between several of these pks and many target sites . to perform quantitative phosphorylation analysis peptide arrays were generated with peptides corresponding to in vivo phosphorylation sites . these peptide _PROTEIN_ were used for kinome profiling of subcellular fractions as well as treated arabidopsis cells . different peptide phosphorylation profiles indicated the presence of overlapping but distinct pk activities in _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ compartments . among different induced pk targets a peptide of the serine/arginine rich _PROTEIN_ splicing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was most strongly affected . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and mapks were found to phosphorylate this peptide as well as full length _PROTEIN_ . however whereas _PROTEIN_ was constitutively active mapks were activated by . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is targeted by different pks . together our data demonstrate that a combination of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ with peptide _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation profiling has a great potential to unravel phosphoproteome dynamics and to identify pk substrates .
on the basis of the technique of _PROTEIN_ purification of phosphopeptides a _METHOD_ _METHOD_ approach was taken to identify in vivo phosphorylation sites of arabidopsis proteins.citation phosphopeptide spectra were subjected to stringent manual verification of phosphopeptides to obtain a reliable data set . this is reflected in the high percentage of corresponding _METHOD_ spectra of each peptide that confirm the sequence the high percentage of unambiguously identified sites the large number of redundant phosphopeptides with miscleavages or different phosphorylation states the large number of conserved sites identified in different homologous proteins and the confirmation of many phosphopeptides _LOCATION_ by one _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ experiment with phosphopeptides of _LOCATION_ proteins . this analysis led to the disclosure of phosphorylation sites on proteins . the ratio between phosphorylated residues was for serine/threonine/tyrosine indicating that as in animals and yeast citation the phosphorylation on tyrosine in arabidopsis is far less abundant than on serine and threonine . we compared our data set with published arabidopsis phosphorylation site studies and found sites previously described by et al. citation by laugesen et al. citation by wolschin and weckwerthcitation and by benschop et al.citation . we also confirmed sites in _PROTEIN_ and fructose phosphate kinase/fructose bisphosphatase.citation more than of our data set includes novel phosphorylation sites including two phosphotyrosine sites . phosphoproteins were assigned to eight different classes based on their domain composition or functional description in the literature . similar to moser and white citation we observed a high percentage of singly phosphorylated peptides . evolutionarily conserved phosphorylation was identified in putatively highly abundant proteins such as metabolic enzymes and ribosomal proteins . however also phosphorylation sites of proteins of expected low abundance were found such as a nucleotide binding domain leucine rich repeat type disease resistance protein and various signaling proteins . one way to screen the obtained data set is to select for phosphorylation sites within pks and protein phosphatases actively involved in reversible phosphorylation modification of proteins . phosphorylation sites of pks and two protein phosphatases were identified including several raf like kinases _PROTEIN_ kinases cyclin dependent kinases related kinase _METHOD_ and calcium dependent pks . more than half of the phosphorylation sites of pks are located within activation loops . in general phosphorylation of the pk activation loop correlates with an active state citation suggesting that the pks that we found to be phosphorylated in their activation loops were active . consequently these pks potentially phosphorylated a number of the pk substrate sites described here . in line with this hypothesis we identified a cdk site in the c terminal region of retinoblastoma related protein _PROTEIN_ which is a known target of a pstaire cdka/cyclin d complex in vitro citation however the actual site had not been identified . in agreement with our hypothesis we found as a phosphorylation site in the activation loop of the arabidopsis pstaire cdka _PROTEIN_ which has recently been identified as important for activation.citation strikingly we also found the upstream cdk activating pk cdkf that phosphorylates cdka in arabidopsis.citation although mutational analysis has indicated that is essential for cdkf activity we determined two other sites a serine in the activation loop and a second site that is located c terminally of the kinase domain . indeed a mutant cdkf has still some activity toward kinase dead cdka citation suggesting that another residue in the activation loop might be functional . interestingly the second site matches with a cdk motif suggesting feedback regulation of cdkf by a cdk perhaps cdka itself or cdkc . since we found cdkf to be active we speculate that in addition to cdka cdkc might also be a target of cdkf . phosphotyrosine sites were identified in a glycogen synthase kinase /shaggy like kinase and in an unknown pk . both sites are located in the activation loop at a position analogous to the tyrosine in mapk activation loops . the same tyrosine residue is phosphorylated in animal alignment of the activation loops of pks belonging to the subgroup shows that more members of this group contain a tyrosine residue at the analogous position and therefore might become phosphorylated on this site as well . all of the arabidopsis like pkscitation contain a tyrosine at the corresponding position . this suggests that phosphorylation on tyrosine residues in pk activation loops could be a more general phenomenon than previously thought . it has been suggested that the peanut serine/threonine/tyrosine _PROTEIN_ kinase is phosphorylated on a tyrosine residue in its activation loop.citation this residue was claimed to be analogous to a tyrosine phosphorylation site in human dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylation regulated kinase . however this residue has not been described as a phosphorylation site . instead mutational analysis and in vivo phosphosite mapping have shown that the previous tyrosine is the correct phosphorylation site.citation this residue is located at the same position as the two tyrosine phosphorylation sites identified in our study and the tyrosine in the activation loop of mapks . this suggests that the peanut _PROTEIN_ kinase might rather be phosphorylated on a threonine residue . to verify the tyrosine phosphorylation of one of the targets that we identified the like kinase was selected . the tyrosine residue that was determined in this protein is located in the activation loop and is analogous to the phosphotyrosine in human that is an autophosphorylation site required for activity.citation full length was produced in e. coli and purified as a glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ fusion protein . in addition two mutants were generated and also purified as _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . first it was tested whether the _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins were phosphorylated on tyrosine by immunoblotting with a specific anti phosphotyrosine antibody . indeed was found to be phosphorylated on tyrosine . mutation of tyrosine to alanine resulted in an almost complete loss of the tyrosine phosphorylation signal . in contrast the mutant displayed normal tyrosine phosphorylation . this indicates that in arabidopsis is autophosphorylated and corresponds to the in vivo tyrosine phosphorylation site identified by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . because lies within the activation loop of the gsks we then asked whether phosphorylation of tyrosine is required for protein kinase activity toward substrates . for this purpose we tested the different variants for their ability to phosphorylate the artificial substrate myelin basic protein . although both the wild type protein and the mutant phosphorylated mbp showed a clearly diminished activity . concluding these data suggest that tyrosine in is phosphorylated and that this event is required for its transphosphorylation activity . the substrate specificity of many pks is partly based on the stereochemistry of the amino acids adjoining the phosphorylation site.citation therefore phosphorylation sites can be grouped into distinct kinase consensus motifs.citation we identified sites that match a casein kinase _PROTEIN_ motif for proline directed kinases and basophilic pk motifs . within the basophilic data set a novel dipolar motifcitation r/k ps/pt d/e/ps/pt was observed times . an example of this well conserved motif is shown in figure citation for _PROTEIN_ and . in addition we observed times the motif r/k ps/pt p which combines basophilic with proline directed kinase motifs . in contrast the double motif ps/pt p x d/e _PROTEIN_ was observed only three times among _PROTEIN_ sites . although the data set does not allow comprehensive analysis of phosphosites there _METHOD_ to be a bias to some of the functional classes for certain motifs . for instance and of the sites of proteins involved in rna metabolism and protein folding and translation are part of proline directed and _PROTEIN_ motifs respectively . it has been proposed that _PROTEIN_ sites account for of eukaryotic phosphoproteomes.citation alignment of all predicted _PROTEIN_ sites shows a bias toward acidic residues at the and positions . since _PROTEIN_ favors the phosphorylation of such motifs citation these sites are good candidates for true _PROTEIN_ targets . several of the potential _PROTEIN_ targets were known _PROTEIN_ substrates in animal and yeast _METHOD_ like _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ribosomal proteins and high mobility group b _PROTEIN_ proteins . plant _PROTEIN_ proteins are also _PROTEIN_ targets citation but to our knowledge no sites have been described . in addition to known _PROTEIN_ targets we found novel putative _PROTEIN_ sites in for instance the chromatin remodelling _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and sumo activating enzyme . phosphorylation often occurs in an ordered fashion by one or multiple kinases . twenty three out of doubly and triply phosphorylated peptides were found in a less phosphorylated form suggesting ordered phosphorylation of the respective proteins . doubly and triply phosphorylated peptides were found with a spacing of amino acids between the phosphosites . the common double phosphorylation motifs ps x ps p and ps/pt p ps p motifs were both found six times implying proline directed kinases in ordered phosphorylation . like kinases often require prephosphorylation of a site at the position . among potential sites we observed for five sites a phosphopeptide with only the priming site phosphorylated but with the site unphosphorylated . as described above a tyrosine phosphorylation site in the activation loop of like kinase _METHOD_ was determined suggesting that they were in their active states . with this information a putative network model centering arabidopsis like kinases was constructed . concluding in our phosphoproteomic screen we found several phosphosites in activation loops of pks that might be linked to downstream targets directly either by analysis of phosphomotifs in substrates or by comparing the data with protein _PROTEIN_ experiments such as those performed for mapks and _PROTEIN_ plants contain _PROTEIN_ rho arf and ran _PROTEIN_ but no ras _PROTEIN_ we identified sites in proteins that are predicted to regulate _PROTEIN_ arf and ran _PROTEIN_ including five in arf _PROTEIN_ activating proteins . arf gap domain _PROTEIN_ and a previously undescribed _PROTEIN_ are phosphorylated on serine residues in a similar region c terminally of the arf gap domain . the site in _PROTEIN_ and has a well conserved dipolar kinase motif in related _PROTEIN_ of other plant species . scarface _PROTEIN_ is involved in trafficking of the auxin efflux facilitator _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and leaf vein pattern formation.citation not only arf gaps but also a member of the arf guanine nucleotide exchange protein family was found to be phosphorylated . we found two proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which function in mirna mediated silencing.citation the _PROTEIN_ site located right after the _PROTEIN_ domain which is an rnase h like domain that likely mediates the rna cleavage activity of _PROTEIN_ . the site is conserved in the closely related _PROTEIN_ and orthologues in other plants but not in mammalian argonaute proteins . the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fragmentation patterns of the _PROTEIN_ peptide are shown in citation . _PROTEIN_ is involved in shoot meristem function and leaf axial patterning by regulating mirna mediated downregulation of genes involved in meristem activity and adaxial leaf fate.citation _PROTEIN_ is phosphorylated at four sites in the n terminal region of the protein . phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ suggests that phosphorylation regulates rna based silencing in plants . several of the identified phosphoproteins are involved in plant development . brahma _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are swi/snf like chromatin remodelling _PROTEIN_ that control developmental _METHOD_ in arabidopsis.citation both proteins have partially redundant functionscitation and were found to be phosphorylated on single sites . the region surrounding the phosphosites suggests that the identified sites might be targeted by different kinases . _PROTEIN_ is an in vitro target of map kinase _PROTEIN_ .citation however our identified phosphosite does not match with a typical mapk consensus site but with a _PROTEIN_ site . although the potential mapk site has not been determined this could suggest that _PROTEIN_ is targeted by different pks on distinct sites . vernalisation _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is involved in the regulation of flowering time citation and was found to be phosphorylated on seven sites . five sites match with a _PROTEIN_ motif one with a proline directed kinase motif and one that shares both these motifs . _PROTEIN_ likely acts in a transcriptional regulator complex related to budding yeast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interacting protein _PROTEIN_ /topless _PROTEIN_ and four topless related proteins are functionally redundant putative transcriptional corepressors that regulate apical embryonic fate.citation a conserved phosphorylation site was determined in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the site is conserved in _PROTEIN_ as well as in proteins from other species that are similar to _PROTEIN_ . the sites identified in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ both match a proline directed/basophilic kinase double phosphorylation motif . although this motif is present in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and it is not found in _PROTEIN_ and . alternative approaches to phosphoproteomics include peptide _PROTEIN_ to identify kinase substrates as well as to quantitatively determine changes in the activities of a mixture of pks under different experimental conditions.citation so far however no _PROTEIN_ were available with peptides corresponding to in vivo phosphorylation sites of plant substrates . therefore we developed a trial _PROTEIN_ with a set of peptide sequences which were selected out of different functional groups of phosphoproteins from our data sets of this and a previous study.citation peptides of amino acid length were synthesized and spotted in triplicate sets on glass slides . we applied pk mixtures consisting of cytoplasmic and _LOCATION_ fractions onto the peptide slides and determined which peptides are phosphorylated . seventeen peptides were phosphorylated by the _LOCATION_ extract and by the _LOCATION_ extract . in total different peptides were phosphorylated on the _PROTEIN_ . in general spot intensities of _PROTEIN_ phosphorylated by pks of the _LOCATION_ extracts were higher than in pk mixtures of the _LOCATION_ extracts which have to be diluted to reduce background noise on the _PROTEIN_ visual inspection and quantitative analysis of the phosphoprofiles revealed a large overlap of peptides that can be phosphorylated by pks of both cellular fractions . however although it is difficult to quantitatively compare the peptide phosphorylation values between the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ extracts several clear differences between kinome activities in these extracts could be seen . overall we observed selective phosphorylation of five peptides by pks in the _LOCATION_ extract and two peptides by _LOCATION_ pks . three of the peptides phosphorylated by only the _LOCATION_ extract are derived from the activation loops of the raf like kinase and _METHOD_ . this observation points to a possible role of and in the _LOCATION_ . in agreement with this hypothesis it was recently reported that two _METHOD_ directly phosphorylate transcription _PROTEIN_ in addition a number of peptides corresponding to five proteins involved in mrna splicing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ all show a relative higher phosphorylation by pks in the _LOCATION_ fraction . in contrast peptides corresponding to an unknown protein and to the activation loop of the _PROTEIN_ kinase ndr were phosphorylated by a pk present or active only in the _LOCATION_ extract . overall these results suggest that the pks that target the activation loops of the respective pks may be either localized or active in particular subcellular compartments . in summary these data indicate that the peptide _PROTEIN_ approach provides a quantitative source for the analysis of pk activities in different subcellular fractions of plant extracts . another application of phosphopeptide profiling on _PROTEIN_ is the analysis of complex pk mixtures in response to changing conditions.citation to test this idea for plants arabidopsis cells were treated by oxidative stress for min with mm that induces activities of the mapks _PROTEIN_ and .citation separate peptide _PROTEIN_ were incubated with _LOCATION_ extracts of control and oxidative stress treated cells . in two independent experiments we observed an increased phosphorylation of a peptide derived from a putative chromatin remodelling protein and a peptide from the activation loop of the pk _GENE_ . interestingly the pk is phosphorylated in vivo on the tyrosine residue suggesting that a tyrosine directed kinase is activated by oxidative stress . phosphorylation of a peptide derived from the mrna splicing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ increased most strongly in all experiments and was therefore selected for further analysis . our data suggested that a pk targeting _PROTEIN_ is rapidly activated by . inspection of the peptide sequence revealed putative phosphorylation motifs for _PROTEIN_ specific pks and mapks . _PROTEIN_ is one of four _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis and might be a plausible candidate because it can phosphorylate another _PROTEIN_ protein.citation however it was not clear whether _PROTEIN_ is activated by . on the other hand mapks are activated by but it was unclear whether they can target _PROTEIN_ . to test whether any of these pks could be responsible for the oxidative stress induced phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was purified as a glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ fusion from e. coli and tested for phosphorylation activity toward purified _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . as shown in figure citationc _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ . in addition to full length _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ several truncated products were phosphorylated by _PROTEIN_ suggesting that n terminal sites are also targeted by _PROTEIN_ . these kinase assays suggested that _PROTEIN_ might be the kinase mediating oxidative stress induced phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ . however by _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts we observed no activation of _PROTEIN_ by . this might be explained by the _PROTEIN_ that _PROTEIN_ contains an aspartic acid at the position analogous to the phosphotyrosine in the activation loop of mapks and the two pks that we found to be phosphorylated . since mutation of phosphosites to acidic residues often mimics the phosphorylated state this might render _PROTEIN_ constitutively active . so we wondered whether inducible mapks can act on _PROTEIN_ . for this purpose _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were immunoprecipitated from arabidopsis cells with specific antibodies . by a radioactive kinase assay it was shown that all three mapks can phosphorylate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ . a slight autophosphorylation activity of _PROTEIN_ and can also be seen . since both _PROTEIN_ and stress responsive mapks phosphorylate full length _PROTEIN_ we addressed the question whether the _PROTEIN_ peptide was phosphorylated on the peptide array by these kinases . to use kinases immunoprecipitated from plant extracts is not possible since they are immobilized on beads that can not be applied on peptide _PROTEIN_ . therefore recombinant _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were separately incubated on the _PROTEIN_ . indeed the peptide was phosphorylated by both kinases . these data show that both _PROTEIN_ and mapks can phosphorylate _PROTEIN_ . however since only mapks are activated by we conclude that the stress responsive pk activity observed in the peptide _PROTEIN_ experiments is derived from mapks . these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ and mapks can act together to mediate both constitutive and oxidative stress induced phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ . it remains to be determined whether _PROTEIN_ and mapks phosphorylate overlapping or different residues in the splicing _PROTEIN_ .
_LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ phosphoproteomes from arabidopsis root cell culture were screened . protein extractions peptide esterification and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were performed as _PROTEIN_

trap _METHOD_ spectrometer was operated in the data dependent mode full scan was followed by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ scans of the four most abundant ions . these ions were excluded from further selection

phosphoric acid is detected among the most intense fragment ions in the preceding _METHOD_ scan . searches against the nonredundant arabidopsis thaliana protein database from ncbi _PROTEIN_ were done

mortar and pestle . from the resulting cell material proteins were isolated as described below . _LOCATION_ extracts from cell material were prepared as described.citation soluble _LOCATION_ extracts were prepared by adding hepes kinase buffer _METHOD_ to cell material and centrifuging for min at . extracts were filtered through gv durapore spin filters to remove particle contaminants . a reaction mixture _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was freshly prepared before each _PROTEIN_ assay and filtered through syringe filters . before the assay _LOCATION_ extracts were diluted four times in hepes kinase buffer to reduce background noise on the _PROTEIN_ after adding of the reaction mixture to of _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ extract the final mix was applied onto the slides as described in the pepchip kinase manual . protein array slides were incubated for h at . afterward the slides were shortly washed in _PROTEIN_ containing triton x then twice for min in m nacl containing triton x and twice for min in water . the slides were then shortly washed twice with water and dried . subsequently the slides were exposed to a phosphorimager screen for days and scanned with a storm scanner . spots were quantified using imagequant and spots with an average of more than arbitrary units were considered positive as only these were found to be consistently phosphorylated in three independent biological replicate experiments . each _PROTEIN_ contained three replicate sets of the peptides and spot intensities were normalized by taking the average of the spot intensities from one slide . to test whether the _PROTEIN_ peptide is phosphorylated by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ of purified glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was incubated for h at on the _PROTEIN_ . subsequent steps were performed as described for cell extracts . this experiment was repeated once . full length was cloned into . for mutagenesis pcr was performed on this plasmid with pfu ultra .

loading buffer . proteins were resolved by _PROTEIN_ polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . the gel was dried and exposed overnight to a phosphorimager screen . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ is activated by of pdedh plasmid containing _PROTEIN_ ha was transformed into protoplasts of arabidopsis root cell culture.citation approximately h after transformation protoplasts were treated for min with mm harvested by a short centrifugation step and frozen in liquid nitrogen . protein extraction buffer was added and extracts were centrifuged at for min . _PROTEIN_ ha was immunoprecipitated overnight with anti ha antibodies and immunocomplex kinase assays were performed as described before.citation samples were handled further as described above . for testing whether mapks phosphorylate
