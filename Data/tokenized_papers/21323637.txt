behaviour of the ne _LOCATION_ during open mitosis has been explored extensively in metazoans but lack of native markers has limited similar investigations in plants . in the present study carried out using living synchronized tobacco by suspension cultures the non functional ne marker lbr _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and two native functional ne proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we provide evidence that the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ retention theory for ne _LOCATION_ is applicable in plants . we also observe two apparently unique plant features location of the ne _LOCATION_ components in close proximity to chromatin throughout division and spatially distinct reformation of the ne commencing at the chromatin surface facing the spindle poles and concluding at the surface facing the cell plate . mobility of the proteins was investigated in the interphase ne during ne breakdown and reformation in the spindle _LOCATION_ and the cell plate . a role for _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ envelope breakdown is suggested .
to follow the dynamics of the sun domain proteins and the ne in living dividing cells stable transformed by cell lines were created that co _PROTEIN_ either histone _PROTEIN_ fused to the _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . histone _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is an a. thaliana chromatin marker and was found to localize to the nucleoplasm labelling chromatin in by cells . as previously reported _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localize to the ne in interphase with low levels of _METHOD_ protein also being present in the _LOCATION_ in some cells . as the cells entered mitosis changes in the distribution of the two sun domain proteins were already noticeable . in prophase as condensing chromatin was observed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ at the ne began to _PROTEIN_ and the fusion proteins to accumulate at opposing sides of the ne presumably where the spindle poles were forming as well as in the _LOCATION_ . the sun labelled ne started to lose its shape and in prometaphase a structured ne was no longer discernible . instead the two sun domain proteins were localized in mitotic _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and accumulated in _LOCATION_ at the spindle _LOCATION_ . in particular _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was observed to be present in tubules and also puncta that surrounded condensing chromatin and were in close proximity to it . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was not observed in puncta but also surrounded chromatin although _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ appeared diffuse . as condensed chromosomes aligned in the division zone in metaphase both sun proteins accumulated in spindle _LOCATION_ close to the spindle poles . however some _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in tubules stretching through the division zone with tubule tips appearing in close proximity to the chromosomes . in some cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the fusion protein was also found in puncta associated with tubules and spindle _LOCATION_ similar to the prometaphase puncta . as the sister chromatids became separated and migrated to the spindle poles in anaphase both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were observed accumulating on decondensing chromatin facing the spindle poles . some tubules were also seen traversing the division zone and in the transition to telophase both sun fusion proteins appeared in the forming cell plate . in telophase the ne containing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ reformed around decondensing chromatin with the sun proteins first present on the side of the chromatin facing the spindle poles then enveloping the sides of the chromatin and lastly surrounding the chromatin facing the growing cell plate . in cytokinesis both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were present in the expanding ne and in the cell plate and phragmoplast . previously we have reported that deleting the n terminus or coiled coil domain from sun domain proteins affects their mobile behaviour in the interphase ne caused by disruption of binding interactions . in the present study we examined the effect of these mutations on the distribution of sun domain proteins in mitotic division . for this we generated stable transformed by cell lines co _PROTEIN_ either _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ where the n terminus is deleted or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ where the coiled coil domain is deleted . a third cell line was generated that co _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . although this fusion protein is full length and not mutated the fusion of _METHOD_ to the n terminus affects the functionality of the protein altering its mobility and interactions . in the two _PROTEIN_ mutant cell lines no general effect on the localization of the sun proteins was observed in comparison with the non mutated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ cell line . however no puncta were observed in prometaphase and metaphase of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells . interestingly the n terminal _METHOD_ fusion affected the ne localization of _PROTEIN_ in interphase by cells as only weak and indistinct ne labelling was observed in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells . in prophase however the fusion protein aggregated specifically at the ne . the localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the remaining phases of the division was similar to that of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . examining the mobility of proteins in the _LOCATION_ gives information on the binding interactions of these proteins . slow mobility indicates strong anchoring binding interactions whereas high mobility suggests that the protein is unbound moving unhindered . frap was used to quantify the mobile fraction and half time of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and lbr _METHOD_ in the interphase ne and mitotic _LOCATION_ of by cells . the mobile fraction denotes the percentage of fusion protein found moving and the half time is an indicator of how fast this movement is . in the day old interphase ne lbr _METHOD_ was very mobile with a mobile fraction of and a half time of s . the mobile fraction and half time of lbr _METHOD_ remained unchanged during nebd in spindle _LOCATION_ during ne reformation and in the cell plate indicating that lbr _METHOD_ remains unbound and freely mobile in these _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ had a mobile fraction of and a half time of s in the interphase ne indicating that over of the fusion protein was mobile and less than was immobilized in the _LOCATION_ . the mobile fraction of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ appeared to remain similar during mitosis as similar mobile fractions were observed for the protein in the metaphase spindle _LOCATION_ and the reforming ne . in the cell plate however the mobile fraction of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was reduced in comparison with the interphase ne indicating that less of the protein was mobile . a similar half time as in the interphase ne was observed in the reforming ne and the cell plate . however in the metaphase spindle _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ appeared to move faster as the half time was significantly _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ had a mobile fraction of and a half time of s in the interphase ne indicating that approximately of the fusion protein population was mobile and approximately was immobile in the _LOCATION_ . during mitosis the mobile behaviour of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was found to vary significantly . during nebd the mobile fraction remained low similar to that of the interphase ne but it showed a higher rate of movement as indicated by a lower half time of s . this suggests that while _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ retains its interphase interactions during prophase nebd changes occur as _LOCATION_ retention commences . in metaphase spindle _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ had almost twice the mobile fraction of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in interphase and during nebd . it also had a shorter half time indicating that it is much more mobile in metaphase spindle _LOCATION_ suggesting that it no longer is part of binding interactions at the interphase ne and during nebd . as most of the spindle _LOCATION_ are no longer surrounding chromatin it may be hypothesized that the interphase/prophase interactions of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ include binding of chromatin or other _LOCATION_ components . this is reinforced by the finding that the mobile fraction of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the reforming ne where it was similar to that of interphase and nebd . the halftime of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the telophase reforming ne was higher than during nebd and similar to that in interphase . in the cell plate _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ had a higher mobile fraction indicating fewer or different interactions than found at the ne . however as still almost half of the protein is immobilized in the cell plate this may suggest that it is also associated in protein complexes there and may fulfil a function .
the construction of all _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ based _METHOD_ protein fusion constructs as well as lbr _METHOD_ has been published previously . the pbib _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was used as a template to make _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . forward primer _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and reverse primer _PROTEIN_ were used to amplify the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence and primers _PROTEIN_ and were used to add flanking recombination sequences . using cloning technology the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence was first inserted into the entry vector and then moved to the binary _PROTEIN_ vector to make _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the vector was introduced into agrobacterium tumefaciens using heat shock transformation . co cultivation _PROTEIN_ from previously published protocols was used to generate stable transformed by cell lines . agrobacteria carrying either _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ lbr _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ were used to stably transform by cells . wild type by cells were grown at in the dark with shaking at rev./min and subcultured every days . for transformation day old cells were used . liquid overnight agrobacteria cultures were centrifuged at g for min at and washed three times with yeb medium containing acetosyringone . bacteria were incubated in a final wash for h before transformation . bacteria and by cells were co cultivated for h at in the dark without shaking on solid by medium containing plates . by cells were then washed three times with liquid by medium containing _PROTEIN_ and timentin . finally cells were plated on solid by medium plates containing _PROTEIN_ timentin and selection antibiotics . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was selected with kanamycin and the other constructs were selected with hygromycin b . cells were incubated at in the dark without shaking for approximately weeks until calli had grown . calli were screened with a leica mzfliii stereomicroscope for _METHOD_ and selected calli were transferred to liquid by medium including selection antibiotics to establish stable _PROTEIN_ by suspension cell lines . stable _PROTEIN_ cell lines were grown and cultured in a similar manner to wild type cell lines . for double transformed cell lines by cells were first transformed with one construct and once stable _PROTEIN_ suspension cells were established these were used for a second transformation with the other construct . synchrony of by cells was based on a previously published protocol . in total ml of day old cells were transferred to ml of fresh medium and aphidicolin was added to a working concentration of . the cells were incubated for h at with shaking in the dark . the aphidicolin was washed out using a sintered glass funnel . the cells were washed ten times with ml of by medium and suspended in ml of fresh by medium after the last wash . cells were returned to the incubator and sampled for analysis between and h after . at least two independent synchrony experiments were carried out for each cell line . cells were mounted on to glass microscope slides covered in a thin film of by medium containing low melting agarose and sealed with a coverslip . confocal imaging was carried out as described previously . acquisition and analysis of frap _METHOD_ data was as described previously except that no latrunculin b treatment was used . approximately frap experiments were carried out for each data set . average . are displayed . for movie acquisition samples were scanned every s for approximately min . the images were converted to movie files using rad video tools .
