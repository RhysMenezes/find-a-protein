low temperature is one of the most important environmental stimuli that control gene transcription _METHOD_ and development in plants . inarabidopsis thaliana the _PROTEIN_ locus is a key negative regulator of low temperature responsive gene transcription . the recessive _PROTEIN_ mutation causes enhanced induction of thecbf transcription _PROTEIN_ by low temperature as well as of their downstream cold responsive genes . the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants flower early and this correlates with a low level of flowering locus c gene _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ gene was isolated through positional cloning . _PROTEIN_ encodes a novel protein with a _PROTEIN_ finger motif near the amino terminus . _PROTEIN_ is ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ in all plant tissues . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ translational fusion studies reveal that _PROTEIN_ protein resides in the cytoplasm at normal growth temperatures . however in response to low temperature treatments _PROTEIN_ accumulates in the _LOCATION_ . ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in wild type plants causes cosuppression of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and mimics the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotypes .
transcripts for the transcription _PROTEIN_ are rapidly induced by low temperature treatment . these transcription _PROTEIN_ in turn activate the _PROTEIN_ of downstream _PROTEIN_ genes such _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . we have shown previously that these _PROTEIN_ genes are superinduced by cold in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . northern analysis was carried out to determine whethercbf genes are also superinduced by cold in the _PROTEIN_ . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were found to exhibit enhanced cold induction in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . at h after cold treatment _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mutants is approximately higher than in wild type plants . increased _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is more pronounced after longer cold treatment for example at and h . we did not observe significant cold induction of _PROTEIN_ in either the wild type or _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . the flowering locus c _PROTEIN_ gene that encodes a mads box protein is a central regulator of flowering induction by vernalization . the level of _PROTEIN_ determines the extent of the vernalization response in the promotion of flowering the duration of cold treatment correlates with the extent of down regulation of _PROTEIN_ . because the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants flower early and appear to be constitutively vernalized we carried out northern analysis to determine whether _PROTEIN_ is altered in the mutant . consistent with previous studies the _PROTEIN_ transcript level is high in wild type _PROTEIN_ plants but it _PROTEIN_ significantly as the plants become vernalized by cold treatments . interestingly _PROTEIN_ mutant plants have a substantially lower level offlc _PROTEIN_ even in the absence of vernalization treatment . this lower level of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ correlates with the early flowering phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . after wk of vernalization treatment the _PROTEIN_ level mutant plants is not reduced . after wk of vernalization the _PROTEIN_ level _PROTEIN_ slightly as does the flowering time . as a control the tubulingene transcript levels are not different between _PROTEIN_ and the wild type and are not changed by vernalization . these results suggest that wild type _PROTEIN_ is a negative regulator of vernalization and that it is required for a high level of _PROTEIN_ . to map _PROTEIN_ genetically homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant plants in the _PROTEIN_ ecotype were crossed with wild type plants of the columbia ecotype . the resulting plants were selfed and homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant plants were selected from the segregating population by luciferase imaging after d of treatment at . surveying of representative molecular markers from each of the five arabidopsis chromosomes located _PROTEIN_ chromosome ii . further analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ is closely linked with the sslp marker _PROTEIN_ . several new sslp markers were developed based on the genomic sequences of bac clones in the _PROTEIN_ region . fine mapping using these new markers delimited _PROTEIN_ to the bac clone . candidate open reading frames on were sequenced from wild type as well as _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . the sequence analysis revealed a single nucleotide substitution in the hypothetical gene in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . this mutation is predicted to create a premature stop codon resulting in a truncated protein . to confirm that we have cloned the correct gene the including bp upstream of the predicted _PROTEIN_ start codon was amplified from wild type plants and cloned into the binary vector . the construct was introduced into _PROTEIN_ mutant plants via agrobacterium mediated transformation . transformants were selected based on hygromycin resistance the progenies of two transformants were tested by luciferase imaging after d of cold treatment . both hygromycin resistance and cold luc _PROTEIN_ segregated in the . all hygromycin resistant plants exhibited the wild type phenotype in _METHOD_ of cold induced _PROTEIN_ luc _PROTEIN_ and time to flower . figure c shows an example of complemented _PROTEIN_ mutant plants in the . in response to cold treatment _PROTEIN_ mutant plants exhibited brighter luminescence indicating a higher level luc _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type . in contrast luminescence intensities from _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings containing the introduced wild type _PROTEIN_ gene were similar to those in wild type plants . quantification of the luminescence intensities confirmed that the mutant was fully complemented by the wild type _PROTEIN_ gene . the wild type _PROTEIN_ transgene also rescued all the other phenotypes exhibited by _PROTEIN_ mutant plants such as pale small leaves and early flowering . the transcribed sequence of the _PROTEIN_ gene was determined by sequencing cdnas obtained by the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction . comparison of the cdna with the genomic sequence showed that the _PROTEIN_ gene contains nine exons and eight introns . _PROTEIN_ is predicted to encode a polypeptide of amino acids with an estimated molecular _METHOD_ of kd . database searches revealed that _PROTEIN_ contains a short stretch of amino acids near the amino terminus that are similar to the _PROTEIN_ finger domain found in a group of proteins known as iaps . the rest of _PROTEIN_ does not show significant homology to any other sequences in the genbank database . the _PROTEIN_ mutation a g a substitution is predicted to create a premature stop codon that truncates the protein after his . this suggests that the _PROTEIN_ terminal one third of _PROTEIN_ is functionally essential . the _PROTEIN_ finger is a small zinc binding domain found in many proteins with diverse functions . recent studies have shown that proteins containing a _PROTEIN_ finger may act as ubiquitin protein ligases and that the _PROTEIN_ finger can interact with ubiquitin conjugating enzymes thereby promoting ubiquitination of specific target proteins . the _PROTEIN_ finger motif is defined as a series of conserved cysteine and histidine residues cys cys cys his cys/his cys cys cys where x can be any amino acid . the _PROTEIN_ finger of _PROTEIN_ is most similar to that of iaps which can be classified as a type _PROTEIN_ . interestingly the first cys in the _PROTEIN_ finger of _PROTEIN_ is replaced with leu . _PROTEIN_ variants have also been seen in other well known _PROTEIN_ finger proteins . for example in mouse is replaced by a thr residue whereas in is substituted for an asp residue . northern analysis was carried out to examine _PROTEIN_ abundance in arabidopsis seedlings subjected to various treatments . in wild type plants _PROTEIN_ mrna was detected in unstressed control as well as cold aba nacl or peg treated samples . _PROTEIN_ abundance was not substantially influenced by aba nacl or peg treatment . in response to cold treatment _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ declined quickly and transiently . at min after cold treatment _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was almost undetectable . however by h after cold treatment _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ recovered to pretreatment levels . this rapid and transient reduction message in response to brief cold treatment was consistently observed in independent experiments . after recovery from the decline _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was then _PROTEIN_ at this level until d after cold treatment before declining again . very low levels of _PROTEIN_ transcript were detected mutant plants subjected to the same treatments as were applied to wild type plants . the low level of _PROTEIN_ is probably attributable to active degradation of the mutant mrna since it is known that mrna surveillance _METHOD_ degrade transcripts with premature stop codons . to verify that the stress treatments were appropriate the rna blot was also probed with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the results show that the two genes were up regulated with the appropriate kinetics that is _PROTEIN_ induction occurred earlier than _PROTEIN_ although not as early as the _PROTEIN_ induction seen in some other experiments . the results also confirm as well as _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ at higher levels in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants under cold treatment . hybridization with a tubulin cdna probe showed rna loading in stressed and in control unstressed sample lanes . to examine _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in various plant tissues kb of the genomic sequence upstream of the _PROTEIN_ open reading frame _PROTEIN_ was fused with _PROTEIN_ reporter gene and the resulting construct was introduced into wild type arabidopsisplants . gus _PROTEIN_ was observed in all plant tissues examined . in leaves the _PROTEIN_ was stronger in the vasculature but could be seen in mesophyll tissues as well . strong _PROTEIN_ was observed in roots with root tips having especially high levels . knowledge of the subcellular localization of a protein is crucial to the understanding of its cellular function . to determine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ gene product _PROTEIN_ was fused in frame at its c terminus with the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ marker . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was _PROTEIN_ under the camv promoter in transgenic arabidopsis plants . the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was determined by green _METHOD_ imaging under a confocal microscope . without cold treatment only very faint green _METHOD_ signals slightly above background could be detected in the majority of cells . this suggests that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was either _PROTEIN_ at a very low level or was being rapidly degraded at normal growth temperatures . occasionally a few cells were found to _PROTEIN_ a high level of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in these cells the green _METHOD_ was entirely cytoplasmically localized . amazingly when the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants were placed at for d green _METHOD_ could be seen in structures consistent with the _LOCATION_ . to verify that the structures emitting green _METHOD_ were _LOCATION_ the seedling roots were stained with propidium iodide . the results show that the green _METHOD_ emitting organelles were stained with propidium iodide suggesting that the organelles are indeed _LOCATION_ . the occasional cells _PROTEIN_ high levels of cytoplasmic _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at normal temperatures also showed strong _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ after cold treatment . the _LOCATION_ accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was clearly visible after plants were subjected to treatment for h. longer cold treatment did not change the intensity of the _LOCATION_ green _METHOD_ . after the cold treated plants were returned to normal growth temperatures for more than h the _LOCATION_ green _METHOD_ disappeared suggesting that the fusion protein moved back to the cytoplasm and/or was rapidly degraded . to determine whether the cold induced _LOCATION_ accumulation is specific to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ we treated transgenic arabidopsis plants containing a known cytoplasmically localized small acidic ribosomal protein _METHOD_ fusion at for h. only cytoplasmically localized green _METHOD_ was detected in these control plants either at or . these results show that cold treatment does not induce a general nonspecific _LOCATION_ accumulation of _METHOD_ fusion proteins . the _PROTEIN_ open reading frame was overexpressed in wild type plants under the camv promoter to determine whether _PROTEIN_ would down regulate _PROTEIN_ lucregulation and affect plant tolerance to _PROTEIN_ or freezing stress . among independent transgenic plant lines tested in the generations none showed reduced _PROTEIN_ luc induction by cold treatments compared to wild type . we also did not find any transgenic lines with altered _PROTEIN_ or freezing tolerance . interestingly there were two transgenic lines that showed higher than wild type levels of _PROTEIN_ luc _PROTEIN_ in response to cold treatment . this phenotype segregated in the generation with an ratio of the high _PROTEIN_ to regular _PROTEIN_ plants . the _PROTEIN_ luc phenotype of one of the lines is shown in c. the high _PROTEIN_ plants were all found to carry the _PROTEIN_ transgene according to their hygromycin resistance . the increased _PROTEIN_ luc _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines mimics the phenotype of mutant plants although the luciferase _PROTEIN_ level was not as high as in the mutant . the strong luminescence phenotype of these transgenic lines is probably a result of posttranscriptional cosuppression of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ because semiquantitative rt pcr tests revealed a _PROTEIN_ amount transcript in the high _PROTEIN_ plants derived from the line .
