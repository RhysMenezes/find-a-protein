the _LOCATION_ apparatus is the central organelle in the secretory pathway and plays key roles in glycosylation protein sorting and secretion in plants . enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of complex polysaccharides glycoproteins and glycolipids are located in this organelle but the majority of them remain uncharacterized . here we studied the arabidopsis _LOCATION_ proteome with a focus on the _LOCATION_ apparatus using localization of organelle proteins by isotope tagging . by applying multivariate data analysis to a combined data set of two new and two previously published localization of organelle proteins by isotope tagging experiments we identified the subcellular localization of proteins with high confidence . these include _LOCATION_ apparatus proteins of which have not been localized previously by a high confidence method as well as the localization of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins . comparison of the hydrophobic domains of the localized proteins showed that the single span transmembrane domains have unique properties in each organelle . many of the novel _LOCATION_ localized proteins belong to uncharacterized protein families . structure based homology analysis identified putative _LOCATION_ glycosyltransferase _PROTEIN_ families that have no functionally characterized members and therefore are not yet assigned to a _PROTEIN_ active enzymes database _PROTEIN_ family . the substantial numbers of these putative _PROTEIN_ lead us to estimate that the true number of plant _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ might be one third above those currently annotated . other newly identified proteins are likely to be involved in the transport and interconversion of nucleotide sugar substrates as well as polysaccharide and protein modification .
we have previously described the lopit approach for high throughput determination of the steady state localization of _LOCATION_ proteins . in this quantitative proteomic technique proteins can be confidently assigned to organelles according to the pattern of their distribution on density gradients . the _PROTEIN_ aim of the work described here was to increase the number of identified _LOCATION_ localized proteins and to find proteins putatively involved in the biosynthesis of the plant cell wall . earlier additional replicate experiments identified relatively few novel proteins . moreover the additional fractionation data from replicate experiments is not easily combined to strengthen localization predictions because there are often incomplete observations of proteins in each data set . many of the proteins involved in sugar nucleotide metabolism and _LOCATION_ trafficking are peripheral . in the lopit experiments by citation these were removed by _PROTEIN_ washing of the isolated _LOCATION_ . to increase the likelihood of identifying novel proteins we carried out two additional lopit experiments with samples enriched in peripheral and luminal proteins . arabidopsis liquid grown callus _LOCATION_ fractions were prepared using conditions to preserve the association of the peripheral and luminal proteins . the distribution profiles of the proteins across the density gradient were estimated from their tryptic peptides labeled by four plex itraq followed by strong cation exchange liquid chromatography tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . to increase the number of fractions sampled two four plex labelings were performed per gradient . this allowed the quantitation of seven fractions with one fraction common to the two labelings . the raw _METHOD_ spectral data sets from the two new lopit experiments and the two lopit experiments of citation were processed or reprocessed in parallel as described in materials and methods to produce protein abundance profiles . these analyses together identified and quantitated proteins . confident subcellular localization requires observations in two or more independent biological samples . a total of proteins achieved this threshold of significance . the number of proteins identified and quantitated was not very different between lopit experiments and versus and however as expected almost all of the novel proteins found only in the experiments using non _PROTEIN_ stripped _LOCATION_ were without predicted tmds . our next aim was to develop an approach to classify the identified proteins into organelle categories using the incomplete protein fractionation information from all eight four plex labelings . it has been demonstrated by citation that combining lopit data sets from different experiments improves the subcellular clustering resolution of proteins . however a known issue with quantitation is that proteins are not observed in every _METHOD_ experiment due to the intensity dependent manner in which _METHOD_ data are collected . thus we expected to see only a minor proportion of proteins present and quantitated in all the experiments . indeed only of the proteins identified and quantitated in these experiments were consistently detected in all eight itraq labelings of the four experiments the rest of the proteins had one or more missing measurements . these missing values can hinder subsequent multivariate analysis and classification _METHOD_ if not accounted for . imputation approaches have already been implemented in two dimensional gel studies and a few reports show the use of such _METHOD_ in quantitative _METHOD_ . the imputation of missing values prior to applying the classification algorithm exploits the covariance of all available protein data . common approaches to missing data imputation include estimation of the joint probability distribution of all variables drawn from the relationship among replicates and sampling missing values from this model . in multivariate data sets it can be difficult to specify a single joint distribution of all variables so sequential sampling from a series of conditional predictive distributions is accepted as an approximation . a missing labeling in the lopit data consists of four values therefore it can be treated as a four dimensional multivariate target variable and in this case multivariate regression is a suitable choice for estimation . a partial least squares _PROTEIN_ regression model was chosen as it allows the use of multivariate predictors and target variables even when the number of variables exceeds the number of cases . in this respect the multiple imputations procedure adopted in this study is closely related to a sequence of regression models technique . the choice of _PROTEIN_ regression as a predictive model was validated by a test on a subset of the data with complete observations in all eight four plex labelings . the number of _PROTEIN_ variables of the model was chosen by a fold cross validation scheme . the mean coefficient of determination for a target variable was with se of . the predictive power was measured by a score where is no better than chance and is the theoretical maximum for a model that explains all the variation in the predicted data . the mean of all classes was with se of showing the validity of the approach . we applied the data imputation approach to estimate the missing values on a data _PROTEIN_ consisting of partial distribution profiles along the density gradient of the proteins with two or more observations . the imputation scheme was validated by simulating random missing labelings and calculating the _LOCATION_ of the imputation and it demonstrated an expected relative _LOCATION_ of the magnitude of to of the real data value . the generation of multiple imputed data sets was then achieved by a bootstrap approach . one hundred imputed data sets were generated by predicting the missing values with a series of _PROTEIN_ regression models where the training set was sampled with replication from the complete and already imputed cases . this procedure is considered to give better estimation of uncertainty than a single imputation of missing data with the best fit value or using a predictive model with a fixed set of parameters . for ease of presentation the data sets were averaged into one _PROTEIN_ that yielded complete subcellular fractionation profiles on proteins in four experiments . this represents a fold increase both in the amount of fractionation data for each protein and in the number of proteins over the experiments reported by citation . the averaged fractionation profiles were studied using principal component analysis in order to visualize the clustering of protein profiles by their organelle localization . in the reanalyzed experiments and the plots show that marker proteins of the same organelle clustered together as seen in the earlier analysis of the _METHOD_ data . the two new data sets with the modified sample preparation also showed clear clustering of marker proteins . the combined data from the four experiments using the imputed fractionation values showed clear clustering similar to the separate data sets again supporting the view that the data imputation was successful . proteins in the lopit data sets previously localized to the _LOCATION_ and six proteins localized to the trans _LOCATION_ network were used as a part of the training set for the classification analysis and prediction of further _LOCATION_ associated proteins . the _LOCATION_ apparatus and the tgn proteins were combined into one class because they have a similar fractionation profile . the rest of the training set was composed of the proteins previously assigned to the pm _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ as well as a nonorganelle _LOCATION_ class used to constrict the classifier . the training set is presented in supplemental table . to classify proteins into compartments a multivariate bayesian classification model with a kernel density estimate was applied to each of the imputed data sets . the choice of the bayesian model as a basis for multivariate classification was motivated by its particularly simple yet robust classification rule that uses a diagonal form of the covariance _PROTEIN_ . it has been reported to outperform a number of other popular classification models for multivariate biological data including quadratic discriminant analysis and nearest neighbor classifier and to yield better classification in situations where the sample values are correlated . using the average posterior probability based on the bayesian classification models of the _LOCATION_ organelle training set proteins were assigned to the correct location . this indicates that the assignments using this approach are likely to be of high confidence . the application of the classification procedure to the proteins with unknown localization resulted in a list of proteins classified as _LOCATION_ localized . as expected most of the proteins reported to be _LOCATION_ localized by citation lie within this set . more than one third have not been previously identified to be _LOCATION_ localized by a high confidence localization study . this represents an increase of over the _LOCATION_ proteome reported by citation . the same classification approach was applied to other organelle proteins resulting in the assignment of proteins to the _LOCATION_ to the pm to the _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ and to the _LOCATION_ . tmds of _LOCATION_ proteins may harbor specific features that reflect the properties of the _LOCATION_ in which they reside . although in plants it has been shown that the tmd length has an effect on the localization of an artificial reporter protein there have been relatively few plant proteins localized precluding detailed investigation of differences in the tmd properties of proteins in different organelles . the large number of proteins reliably localized by lopit here provides an opportunity to study whether plant proteins show organelle specific tmd properties . a subset of the proteins classified by the lopit approach was annotated as being putative single span tmd proteins using the predictions from tmhmm . the amino acid sequences of these proteins in and around their hydrophobic transmembrane span regions were analyzed similarly to citation . this analysis refines the _LOCATION_ hydrophobic start point of the tmd span according to a consistent heuristic function . the identification of hydrophobic start point allows aligning and computing different properties along the tmd sequence such as average amino acid compositions and corresponding derived parameters such as residue size and hydrophobicity . also measurements were made of the estimated extramembrane protein sequence length on the _LOCATION_ side of the tmd from the same start point . to provide increased numbers of proteins for statistical analysis the data set was augmented by the inclusion of plant orthologs of the organelle classified arabidopsis proteins . the method for incorporating close ortholog sequences and removing familial sample bias was done as described previously for fungi and vertebrates . the sequence database used for the ortholog search was the streptophyta phylum subset of the uniprot database . the mean hydrophobicity of amino acid residues of all the putative tmd sequences at positions relative to the _LOCATION_ ends of their hydrophobic cores was calculated using the goldman engelman and steitz _PROTEIN_ scale and plotted for the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and pm organelle classifications . the hydrophobic regions of the tmds from the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ were of similar maximum hydrophobicity with this maximum extending over the same number of residues . in contrast for pm tmds the region of maximum hydrophobicity extended for a further five residues similar to the situation observed in fungi and vertebrates . to demonstrate that positional averages did not obscure any differences we plotted the frequency of hydrophobic length defined with an intermediate _PROTEIN_ scale threshold of kcal . the distribution plot shows distinct profiles for the three compartments with the mean tmd hydrophobic span lengths of residues for the _LOCATION_ for the _LOCATION_ and for the pm . we tested the dependence of the hydrophobic length output on the _PROTEIN_ scale threshold used to define tmd ends and concluded that the difference between pm _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ is relatively unaffected by the threshold chosen suggesting that the difference is robust . since residue volumes are distributed asymmetrically in pm and _LOCATION_ tmds of fungi and vertebrates the mean residue volume was calculated along the plant tmd sequences . the tmd regions of different organelles showed no significant differences _PROTEIN_ the amino acid volume close to the _LOCATION_ edge . however in the luminal/exoplasmic leaflet region starting from position there are clear differences the pm tmds have a significant drop in the mean residue volume whereas _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ remain similarly high throughout the tmd . to investigate this in more detail we analyzed the frequency of each amino acid at each position through the tmd . the amino acid compositions show differences between the tmds from different organelles . some of these differences are clearly associated with the differences in mean residue volume . in particular the larger hydrophobic residues are relatively depleted in the outer leaflet portion of the pm tmds compared with _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ while the smaller hydrophobic residues show the opposite trend . in addition to these differences in residue size there appear to be other organelle specific trends . for example the pm tmds have enriched abundance of the basic residues on the _LOCATION_ side and increased occurrence of cys in the interfacial region of the inner leaflet . the _LOCATION_ tmds are characterized by lower occurrence of lys in the outer leaflet region whereas the _LOCATION_ tmds have increased occurrence of met in the interfacial region of the outer leaflet . the length of the _LOCATION_ tail of the single span tmd proteins also displayed specific variations for the three organelles . over of the _LOCATION_ apparatus proteins have a _LOCATION_ tail of fewer than amino acid residues . almost as frequently of _LOCATION_ proteins have similarly short _LOCATION_ tails this observation holds for fewer than of pm proteins . this is to be expected since the transmembrane pm proteins _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ are likely to perform more functions on the _LOCATION_ side . many of the proteins identified as _LOCATION_ localized were annotated in the arabidopsis information resource database as proteins of unknown function . since a large number of the proteins in the _LOCATION_ apparatus are likely to be involved in glycosylation we investigated whether any of these proteins show predicted structural homology to proteins of known function and structure . currently d structural information is available for of the classified cazy _PROTEIN_ families . we analyzed the sequences of all _LOCATION_ proteins using hhpred an alignment tool based on the pairwise comparison of hidden markov model profiles . hhpred builds a hidden markov model profile from a query amino acid sequence and compares it with a database of hidden markov models representing annotated protein families or domains with known structure and provides greater sensitivity and selectivity in finding remote homologs than other sequence profile based methods such as psi blast . the analysis of all the _LOCATION_ localized proteins identified of as having a probable fold related to known _PROTEIN_ of these were classified in cazy and proteins were identified as putative _PROTEIN_ not classified in cazy families . in addition the _PROTEIN_ family as well as three other unrelated proteins showed significant similarity to a conserved s adenosylmethionine binding methyltransferase fold . to obtain an overview of the _LOCATION_ proteome all proteins were assigned to functional groups and these are shown in figure and supplemental table . for a full list of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ like proteins see supplemental table .
we used the established arabidopsis liquid grown callus for the proteomic analysis . the conditions of growth were as described by citation . organelle separation was achieved from homogenized arabidopsis cell culture using density centrifugation as described before . for the peripheral lopit experiment the _LOCATION_ fractions obtained from the density centrifugation were not treated with sodium _PROTEIN_ . proteolysis was achieved with trypsin and the peptides were labeled with four plex itraq separated by strong cation exchange chromatography and analyzed on an ab sciex _PROTEIN_ quadrupole time of flight liquid chromatography _METHOD_ system as described previously . the raw _METHOD_ data files obtained from the _PROTEIN_ were processed using the software to generate centroided and uncentroided peak lists containing _METHOD_ to charge ratio and intensity information for each product ion spectrum . the centroided peak lists were analyzed by mascot _PROTEIN_ and queried against the tair nonredundant protein database using the following modifications fixed _PROTEIN_ variable itraq four plex itraq four plex itraq four plex oxidation . the ion score significance threshold was set to _METHOD_ tolerance was set to d and the _METHOD_ tolerance was set to d. each centroided peak list was also searched separately against a _PROTEIN_ reversed version of the database in order to determine the mascot peptide score resulting in a false identification rate of less than in each lopit experiment . hence the minimum peptide mascot scores for proteins identified with two or more peptides were for lopit experiment for lopit experiment for lopit experiment and for lopit experiment . the thresholds for identification of proteins with single peptides were and for experiments to respectively . proteins identified by two or more distinct peptides in at least one experiment were retained . the xml files created from the integrated data set were exported to the pride database . the uncentroided peak lists were processed with i tracker software in order to calculate the normalized itraq reporter ion areas . the genome annotating proteome pipeline system was used to link identification information with quantitation data in a mysql database . peptides were assigned to proteins only if at least three of their reporter ion peaks were above a threshold of counts and if they had a mascot score of at least . in addition peptides matching multiple proteins were not used for protein quantitation . the quantitative data obtained from the four reporter ions of the itraq label was corrected for the isotope impurities and normalized such that the four reporter ions sum to one . quantitation data from multiple peptides from the same protein were averaged to provide a fractionation profile for the identified proteins . proteins identified and quantitated in two or more experiments were retained . the normalized four plex data sets were concatenated in one _PROTEIN_ presented in supplemental table . protein profiles that were present in only one experiment were discarded . the protein profiles that had missing four plex data were imputed by a _PROTEIN_ regression model . the imputation was performed sequentially . first the entire data set was divided into subgroups according to the number and positions of missing four plex data . for each subgroup the missing labeling was estimated by a _PROTEIN_ regression model built using proteins where all labelings were present . the estimated labeling was then considered known and used as a predictor for building subsequent regression models . the process was performed first for the protein profiles having one four plex labeling missing and then repeated for those with two missing labelings . this process was iterated until all the missing values were imputed . the validation of this method was performed using a cross validation approach . one nonmissing four plex was randomly removed from each protein with up to five missing labelings and the _PROTEIN_ regression method was applied to this new data set in order to predict known and unknown missing values . the predicted four plexes were then compared with the known values and the prediction relative _LOCATION_ was calculated . this process was repeated times and the expected _LOCATION_ was estimated by a mean _LOCATION_ and its confidence interval . the list of protein identifiers with known subcellular localization was manually curated from published research papers with the assistance of the tair and _PROTEIN_ databases . the training set was composed of proteins localized by methods that were lopit orthogonal and considered of high confidence _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . this way we gathered a list of protein identifiers distributed in seven classes _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ . their corresponding quantity profiles were used as a training set for the classification model . the multivariate classification rule with diagonal covariance _PROTEIN_ was used to build a multivariate classification model . the prior probability for a particular protein to be assigned to one of six classes was set uniformly . the class posterior distributions were modeled in a nonparametric way using a gaussian smoothing kernel . in order to account for the uncertainty of classification originating from the missing value imputation step a multiple imputation approach was undertaken as described previously . exactly variants of an imputed data set were generated using the bootstrapped sequential imputation procedure described above in order to explore the variation in the prediction . classification models were built for each of the generated data sets . the average posterior probability was calculated to reflect the variability of the class probability distributions and the imputed data . the performance of the classifier was evaluated using a leave one out cross validation scheme where the localization of one of the proteins from the training set was predicted using the remaining training set proteins . the proteins in the training set were correctly assigned in of these models . proteins were finally assigned using organelle specific thresholds based on the average posterior probability of assignments of the training set proteins and the predicted classes are presented in supplemental table . the data processing was done using the matlab statistical toolbox . the single span tmd proteins from the lopit classified set were identified using a combination of sequence filtering employing signalp version tmhmm and glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor prediction . in the first pass only protein sequences were accepted according to the tmhmm prediction of the transmembrane spans if the protein appears to have only one transmembrane span or if it appears to have two but the first span is at the n terminus . if a transmembrane span was at the n terminus and predicted to be a signal sequence according to signalp then the protein was excluded if this was the only transmembrane span but accepted if this was the first of two tmhmm predictions . any sequence that passed these tests was subject to the gpi anchoring prediction tool method of gpi anchor prediction used by citation which excluded some putative gpi sequences on the basis of a c terminal hydrophobic signal peptide . in order to augment the organelle classified arabidopsis sequences close orthologs in related _METHOD_ were identified in the streptophyta clade within the uniprot database . the expanded lists of protein sequences were reduced for redundancy and analyzed for their _LOCATION_ extra _LOCATION_ length and tmd sequence properties amino acid composition hydrophobicity and residue volume as described by citation . the remote homology detection server hhpred was used to search for homologs to the uncharacterized protein families . all searches were conducted with the default settings three hhblits iterations were performed in local alignment mode to build up a multiple sequence alignment from the input sequence . the algorithm was used to search the protein data bank for d structures pfam and cdd for primary structures and the arabidopsis protein database for determining the closest cazy _PROTEIN_ family to the query . the following materials are available in the online version of this article . supplemental figure . number of proteins with and without predicted tmds identified and quantitated
