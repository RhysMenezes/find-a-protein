the functions of the minor phospholipid phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate during vegetative plant growth remain obscure . here we targeted two related phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which are _PROTEIN_ ubiquitously in arabidopsis thaliana . a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant with reduced ptdins levels showed dwarf stature and phenotypes suggesting defects in auxin distribution . the roots of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant had normal auxin levels but reduced auxin transport and altered distribution . _METHOD_ tagged auxin efflux carriers _PROTEIN_ formed _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ displayed abnormal partially apolar distribution . furthermore fewer brefeldin a induced endosomal bodies decorated by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ formed in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants . inducible overexpressor lines for _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ also exhibited phenotypes indicating misregulation of auxin dependent processes and immunolocalization showed reduced _LOCATION_ association of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ cycling and _PROTEIN_ require clathrin mediated endocytosis and labeled clathrin light chain also displayed altered localization patterns in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant consistent with a role for ptdins in the regulation of clathrin mediated endocytosis . further biochemical tests on subcellular fractions enriched for clathrin coated vesicles indicated that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants have reduced ccv associated _PROTEIN_ kinase activity . together the data indicate an important role for ptdins in the control of clathrin dynamics and in auxin distribution in arabidopsis .
to examine the role of _PROTEIN_ kinases we first identified arabidopsis genes encoding _PROTEIN_ kinase _METHOD_ with potential roles in vegetative tissues using transcript array information accessible through genevestigator . in previous experiments recombinant _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ displayed the highest specific activities among ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ kinases from arabidopsis therefore we chose these genes for further characterization . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ sequences cluster together on a subclade of a phylogenetic tree of all deduced arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ kinase amino acid sequences suggesting related functionality . the third gene in this subclade _PROTEIN_ is restricted in _PROTEIN_ to roots and affects root hair formation . all other _PROTEIN_ kinase _METHOD_ are more distantly related and notably different from _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . we verified _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in vegetative tissues using bp promoter fragments of the genes to drive the _PROTEIN_ of a _PROTEIN_ reporter construct in transgenic plants followed by histochemical staining and independently by quantitative real time rt pcr . the promoter gus experiments indicated that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ already early in development and have similar _PROTEIN_ patterns in vegetative tissues as well as in flowers and pollen . promoter activity was especially high in procambial tissues and the root tips as previously noted for _PROTEIN_ . quantitative real time rt pcr analysis supports _PROTEIN_ of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in leaves flowers roots whole seedlings and flower buds . we next isolated homozygous arabidopsis t dna mutant lines with exon insertions in the genes _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . we inferred homozygosity from the inability to amplify wild type alleles by pcr concomitant with positive amplification of t dna tagged alleles . t dna insertions were found in the first exon of _PROTEIN_ bp downstream from the _PROTEIN_ and between the first exon and the first intron of _PROTEIN_ bp downstream from the _PROTEIN_ . a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant was obtained by crossing homozygous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant lines and the combined genotype was verified by pcr . quantitative real time rt pcr showed that transcripts of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ were reduced below the limits of detection in the respective single mutants . interestingly reduction of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ transcripts was accompanied by elevated levels of the transcripts of the other _PROTEIN_ kinase gene over the level of wild type controls . this indicates a compensatory effect at the level of transcription and complicates the interpretation of single mutant phenotypes . by contrast the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant showed reduced levels of both transcripts . we measured the levels of ptdins and various other phospholipids for wild type controls the two single mutants the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant and for a double mutant line ectopically _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ under an intrinsic bp promoter fragment by quantification of unlabeled compounds . additionally ptdins was independently quantified also by radiolabeling using pi of wild type controls the two single mutants and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . the most prominent changes in lipid levels were observed for ptdins which was reduced in the double mutant by and of wild type levels according to nonlabeled analysis and radiolabeling respectively . the single mutants showed a less pronounced reduction of ptdins . the reduction of ptdins in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant was accompanied by increases in phosphatidylinositol phosphate and phosphatidylinositol its biosynthetic precursors . among structural phospholipids the level of phosphatidylcholine was slightly _PROTEIN_ possibly indicating _PROTEIN_ processes of _LOCATION_ to a reduction in ptdins . other lipids tested including phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidic acid did not display notably altered abundance in the single or double mutants . single homozygous _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutants showed only mildly altered growth . by contrast the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant displayed a strong growth defect characterized by reduced leaf expansion reduced root elongation in the light and a reduction in apical dominance resulting in multiple shoots from a single plant at a very _PROTEIN_ stage of development . senescence was delayed in the double mutant and plants could reach an age of over months in long day conditions . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants did not make seeds . as the double mutant did not produce flowers or siliques double mutants were propagated as segregating offspring of selfed plants genotyped as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . plants homozygous for _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ and heterozygous for the respective other allele _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ displayed phenotypes intermediate between those of the single mutants and the homozygous double mutant . ectopic _PROTEIN_ of either untagged _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the native bp promoter fragments in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant produced phenotypes similar to the single mutants or even the wild type controls . this observation supports the notion that the _METHOD_ tagged variants of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ retained full functionality in vivo . the phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant resembles that of plants deficient in biosynthesis or perception of auxin . to better characterize whether auxin dependent responses were altered in plants with reduced _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and/or _PROTEIN_ we monitored gravitropic bending of roots and hypocotyls . seedlings were grown in the dark for d on vertical agar plates the plates were rotated by for h as previously described and gravitropic curvature was recorded . compared with wild type controls gravitropic curvature of hypocotyls and roots was slightly reduced in _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ single mutants and substantially reduced in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . a complemented double mutant line ectopically _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ displayed curvature of roots and hypocotyls similar to wild type controls . the elongation of dark grown roots and hypocotyls was determined for all lines tested and not found to be significantly different . because the phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant included reduced root growth apical dominance and gravitropic bending we speculated that these aspects might be a consequence of defects in auxin signaling . the wild type controls and the double mutant showed similar levels of endogenous auxin . by contrast the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant showed significantly reduced basipetal auxin transport . auxin distribution was also tested by monitoring driven _METHOD_ distribution in roots . in wild type controls the dependent _METHOD_ distribution reflected the characteristic auxin maximum in the root tip and the signal was further intensified by the exogenous application of indole acetic acid . by contrast no _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants neither in the absence nor the presence of exogenous iaa . the presence of the _METHOD_ construct was confirmed by pcr . to rule out genetic effects of incrossing an independent gus reporter line was created in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ background and analyzed for responses to endogenous and exogenous auxins . as for the _METHOD_ reporter the gus reporter also did not indicate an auxin maximum in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . reporter activity only marginally increased in response to exogenous auxins such as naphthalene acetic acid or dichlorophenoxyacetic acid . importantly the spatial distribution of the driven gus signal in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant differed substantially from that in wild type controls . to test whether _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants were still sensitive to exogenous auxins we treated wild type controls and double mutants with auxin and monitored root elongation over a period of d . the double mutant displayed substantially reduced root growth within the limits of mutant growth naphthalene acetic acid d and iaa had similar inhibitory effects on root elongation as in wild type controls . although the reporter does not provide bona fide information on auxin levels the data suggested that auxin perception was not impaired in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . furthermore this experiment demonstrated that the application of exogenous auxins did not aid root growth in the double mutant . overall the data presented in figure and supplemental figure online indicate that reduced levels of ptdins parallel reduced capability to _PROTEIN_ basipetal auxin transport in root tips . to examine the biochemical functionality of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ variants used in this study we recombinantly _PROTEIN_ the proteins as fusions to n terminal maltose binding protein tags used to enhance solubility . biochemical characterization showed that _METHOD_ tagged variants of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ displayed catalytic activity in vitro . in vitro catalytic activity did not differ between enzyme variants carrying only an n terminal maltose binding protein tag or an additional c terminal _METHOD_ tag consistent with previous reports . heterologous _PROTEIN_ of untagged or _METHOD_ tagged variants of either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ restored the ability to grow at prohibitive temperature in a saccharomyces cerevisiae strain carrying an allele of _METHOD_ encoding a temperature sensitive variant of the _PROTEIN_ kinase _METHOD_ . the data confirm catalytic activity of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and indicate that _METHOD_ tagged variants of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were functional in vitro corroborating the mutant complementation tests . to investigate the subcellular distributions of the proteins and to assess the impact of overproduction of the two kinases we overexpressed _METHOD_ tagged versions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . as the _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ under their own promoters displayed only very weak _METHOD_ we replaced the native promoters with estradiol inducible promoters of the system which should induce gene _PROTEIN_ strongly upon estradiol treatment . we verified induction of the transgenes by monitoring _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . in root tip cells of these lines _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ displayed clear _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization and weak diffuse _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ characteristic of soluble enzymes that associate peripherally with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and in particular resembling localization patterns previously reported for other plant _PROTEIN_ kinases in other cell types . interestingly both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ displayed pronounced _PROTEIN_ distribution and localized predominantly to apical and basal _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ areas . in some cases this localization pattern was accompanied by _LOCATION_ localization . to test whether _PROTEIN_ distribution observed for the overexpressed _PROTEIN_ kinases was independently reflected by corresponding _PROTEIN_ of ptdins we analyzed the distribution of the lipid by monitoring _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ a reporter that specifically binds ptdins . in plants not overexpressing a _PROTEIN_ kinase _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ displayed _PROTEIN_ distribution to apical and basal _LOCATION_ domains in a pattern similar to that found for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . we quantified the _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ as ratios of _PROTEIN_ versus apicobasal _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ which were significantly less than one in cells of both the root cortex and the root epidermis . plants used for localization studies were only mildly induced . consistent with overproduction of the _PROTEIN_ kinases strongly induced overexpressing lines accumulated increased amounts of ptdins . when the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overexpressors were grown on vertical agar plates containing up to estradiol the plants exhibited a loss of gravitropic growth concurrent with random nondirectional root growth . by contrast estradiol treatment did not affect the growth of control plants overexpressing _METHOD_ . random root growth was not observed in noninduced plants . auxin related phenotypes of the overexpressors were not limited to gravitropic bending . seven day old seedlings of all selected overexpressor lines exhibited changes in root hair morphology after h of incubation on agar plates containing estradiol . root hairs of the induced overexpressors were shorter and _PROTEIN_ compared with noninduced controls . in addition root hairs in the induced overexpressors often initiated at multiple sites of the trichoblasts . the pattern observed was similar to that previously reported for root hair specific overexpression of the _PROTEIN_ kinase isoform _PROTEIN_ and resembles phenotypes described for plants with perturbed auxin distribution in roots . the effect on root hair morphology likely results from the ectopic _PROTEIN_ kinase _PROTEIN_ as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are normally _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the vascular tissue of roots and only to a low degree in trichoblasts and root hairs . no difference was observed between the n terminally tagged _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and the c terminally tagged _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with _PROTEIN_ to subcellular localization accumulation of ptdins or any of the auxin related phenotypes . to test whether the phenotypes and changed auxin distribution in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant was linked to changed patterns of _PROTEIN_ distribution we crossed arabidopsis lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ into the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant background and monitored the _METHOD_ distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in root tips . clear _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization was observed in wild type controls _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the _PROTEIN_ patterns observed corresponded well with previously reported patterns and in cells of the central cylinder _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized predominantly to the basal side of the cells whereas _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized predominantly to the apical sides of cortex cells . in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant background _METHOD_ intensities observed for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were reduced . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized slightly more diffusely compared with the sharply defined patterns found in wild type controls . _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ association of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was not limited to the basal or apical sides of the cells . instead in the double mutant _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was also sometimes detected in _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ areas . these observations indicate perturbed _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ proteins as a consequence of reduced levels of ptdins . to test whether effects of overexpressing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ would also result in altered distribution of _PROTEIN_ proteins overexpressor lines were grown on vertical agar plates and induced by the addition of estradiol . plants displaying agravitropic root growth were selected and the distribution of endogenous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was analyzed using immunodetection by specific antibodies against arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . in estradiol treated plants _PROTEIN_ an _METHOD_ control _PROTEIN_ was detected at the basal _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of cells of the central cylinder whereas _PROTEIN_ was detected at the apical _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of cortex cells representing wild type distribution . _PROTEIN_ localization in the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overexpressors resembled that found in the control plants . _PROTEIN_ localization in the overexpressors differed from that in the _METHOD_ controls by consistently displaying weaker _LOCATION_ association under identical conditions for immunodetection and _METHOD_ imaging . these observations suggest that overexpression of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ altered the _LOCATION_ association of _PROTEIN_ which might result from perturbed endocytic trafficking . to assess effects of reduced ptdins levels on endocytic cycling of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ we successively applied cycloheximide and brefeldin a which inhibit de novo protein synthesis and the reinsertion of membranous compartments into the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ respectively resulting in the formation of bfa bodies . care was taken not to exceed bfa . when chx and bfa were applied to wild type roots _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ bfa bodies decorated by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ became visible within a few minutes and increased over min indicating a substantial rate of endocytic recycling of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ between the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and endosomal compartments . in sharp contrast in roots of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ we observed fewer and smaller bfa bodies within min of chx/bfa treatment . the data indicate that in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant endocytic cycling of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was impaired upstream of bfa sensitive endosomes . overview images of chx/bfa treated root tissue are provided in supplemental figure online . to test whether defects in endocytosis affected overall _LOCATION_ internalization wild type controls the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutants and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant were subjected to chx/bfa treatment stained with the styryl dye and the subcellular distribution of the dye was monitored over a period of min . in all cases the dye was internalized and decorated bfa bodies . in the controls the single mutants and the double mutant the number of bfa bodies per cell increased with time of dye exposure indicating that _LOCATION_ internalization was essentially functional . quantitative analysis revealed a _PROTEIN_ number of bfa bodies per cell in the mutant lines for the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant the reduction compared with wild type controls was significant after and min of dye application . the data indicate that reduced levels of ptdins impaired endocytosis of certain components while other aspects remained largely as in the wild type . this observation is in line with the notion of alternative routes of endocytosis only some of which might depend on ptdins . the endocytic cycling of _PROTEIN_ proteins from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ requires clathrin mediated endocytosis . furthermore cme has been linked to phosphoinositides in tobacco pollen tubes . to further substantiate the hypothesis that cme of _PROTEIN_ proteins requires ptdins in arabidopsis we monitored the dynamic _LOCATION_ association of _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ light chain _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in d old roots of wild type controls and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants by spinning disc confocal live imaging . in wild type controls _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ decorated small punctae in the focal plane of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and larger fast moving structures outside the focal plane likely representing the trans _LOCATION_ network . the smaller _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ associated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ foci appeared in wild type controls at a mean density of per _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and were characterized by their transient appearance and disappearance within a time interval of s as indicated by kymograph analysis . in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ associated foci were present at a substantially reduced density of only per _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . individual _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ foci did not display alterations in dwell time at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but appeared overall much larger in the double mutant than in wild type controls . the data indicate that recruitment of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants was not impaired but that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ displayed altered distribution into fewer but larger _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ associated foci . this observation is consistent with the notion that clathrin dependent internalization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was impaired in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . to verify effects of ptdins production on _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dynamics we examined the rates of ptdins formation in subcellular fractions enriched for ccvs . in arabidopsis salt stress can trigger increased formation of ccvs . furthermore the levels of ptdins in arabidopsis increase upon salt treatment and associate with ccvs . therefore we performed salt stress experiments to test whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ contributed to the formation of ccv associated ptdins in arabidopsis . hydroponically grown wild type controls and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants were subjected to salt treatment by the application of m nacl in culture medium and ccvs were isolated from leaves prior to stimulation and after min precisely as previously reported . only the single _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants could be used for hydroponic growth as the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants are too small to provide the amount of material required for these tests . in wild type plants ccv associated _PROTEIN_ kinase activity increased upon salt stress consistent with either translocation of a _PROTEIN_ kinase from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to ccvs or with activation of ccv associated _PROTEIN_ kinase . by contrast in the _PROTEIN_ mutant ccv associated _PROTEIN_ kinase activity exhibited only a limited increase and no increase was detected in the _PROTEIN_ mutant upon stress treatment . the data indicate that the ccv associated _PROTEIN_ kinase activity is attributable largely to _PROTEIN_ and to a lesser degree _PROTEIN_ . the pattern is consistent with the in vitro catalytic activities of the recombinant enzymes as _PROTEIN_ displays five to sixfold higher activity than its close homolog _PROTEIN_ . the combined characterization of ccvs formed upon salt treatment supports the notion that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ associate with ccvs consistent with a role for ptdins in cme .
amplification of bp genomic sequences upstream of coding sequences for use as promoters was achieved with different arabidopsis thaliana bacterial artificial chromosome clone templates as indicated

product into pgem t easy it was moved as a noti noti fragment into the vector . the coding region for _PROTEIN_ was moved from _PROTEIN_ pgem t easy into the plasmid ccdb as a noti noti fragment .

coding region for _PROTEIN_ was moved from _PROTEIN_ pgem t easy as a sali noti fragment into _METHOD_ . both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were then transferred to the _PROTEIN_ plasmid
