a waxy cuticle that serves as a protective barrier against uncontrolled water loss and environmental damage coats the aerial surfaces of land plants . it is composed of a cutin polymer _PROTEIN_ and waxes . cuticular waxes are complex mixtures of very long chain fatty acids and their derivatives . we report here the molecular cloning and characterization of _PROTEIN_ a wax biosynthetic gene from arabidopsis . arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ mutants exhibit major _PROTEIN_ in stem primary alcohols and wax esters and slightly elevated levels of aldehydes alkanes secondary alcohols and ketones . this phenotype suggested that _PROTEIN_ encoded an alcohol forming fatty acyl coenzyme a reductase . we identified eight far like genes in arabidopsis that are highly related to an alcohol forming far _PROTEIN_ in seeds of jojoba . molecular characterization of _PROTEIN_ alleles and genomic complementation revealed that one of these eight genes _GENE_ encoded the far required for cuticular wax production . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ cdna in yeast resulted in the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ primary alcohols . fully functional green _METHOD_ protein tagged _PROTEIN_ protein was localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in yeast cells by confocal microscopy . analysis of gene _PROTEIN_ by reverse transcription pcr indicated that _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in leaves _METHOD_ flowers siliques and roots . _PROTEIN_ of a _PROTEIN_ reporter gene driven by the _PROTEIN_ promoter in transgenic plants was detected in epidermal cells of leaves and _METHOD_ consistent with a dedicated role for _PROTEIN_ in cuticular wax biosynthesis . _PROTEIN_ was also _PROTEIN_ in all cell types in the elongation zone of young roots . these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ is an alcohol forming far that has specificity for very long chain fatty acids and is responsible for the synthesis of primary alcohols in the epidermal cells of aerial tissues and in roots .
a query of the arabidopsis genome database with the deduced amino acid sequence of the jojoba far using blast search _METHOD_ revealed a group of eight sequences in the arabidopsis genome that were highly related to the jojoba far over their entire length . one of these sequences is _METHOD_ the gene that encodes a tapetum specific protein essential for pollen fertility but the functions of the other seven far like genes in arabidopsis have not been investigated . to determine whether any of these genes corresponded to _PROTEIN_ involved in the formation of primary alcohols in the cuticle we correlated the positions of identified far like sequences with the position of the _PROTEIN_ mutation on the arabidopsis genetic map . only one of the putative fars _GENE_ matched the genetic map position of _PROTEIN_ on chromosome at cm and was thus considered a candidate for being _PROTEIN_ . sequencing of the _GENE_ genomic clone revealed an _LOCATION_ in the deposited genomic sequence through comparisons to deposited full length cdna sequences . this _LOCATION_ was an extra nucleotide causing a frame shift in the predicted coding sequence . the corrected _GENE_ gene consists of exons and the entire exon intron region is bp in length . the full length cdna sequence contains an open reading frame of bp encoding a amino acid protein . pcr amplification of the _GENE_ gene in the _PROTEIN_ mutant indicated the presence of a deletion and/or rearrangement of at least bp spanning bp of the promoter region the untranslated region and at least bp downstream of the translation start . a t dna insertion is present in the fourth intron of _GENE_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the finding that two independently isolated mutant lines with the same glossy stem wax phenotype both had changes in the same gene indicated that _PROTEIN_ is indeed encoded by _GENE_ . to confirm the identity of the _PROTEIN_ gene we also obtained two salk t dna insertion lines _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ containing t dna insertions in the fifth exon and fourth intron respectively of the _GENE_ gene from the arabidopsis biological resource center _PROTEIN_ . homozygotes of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ exhibited glossy stem phenotypes similar to the previously characterized _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines . finally the extent of _PROTEIN_ gene disruption was examined by semiquantitative reverse transcription pcr . very low levels of _PROTEIN_ mrna were detected in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines whereas no transcript was found in _PROTEIN_ . taken together these results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is identical to the far like gene _GENE_ . the total wax loads on _METHOD_ of all three wild type lines of arabidopsis were found to be very similar under the growth conditions used here ranging from for ws to for ler and columbia . the total wax coverage on inflorescence _METHOD_ of the four mutant lines did not differ from respective wild types . furthermore both the absolute amounts and the relative proportions of the fatty acids aldehydes alkanes secondary alcohols and ketones did not differ between the wax mixtures of the wild type lines and between the _PROTEIN_ lines and the corresponding wild types . the only compound classes affected by _PROTEIN_ mutations were the primary alcohols and the alkyl esters reduced from wild type levels of to and to respectively to only trace amounts in the mutant lines . composition of cuticular waxes on inflorescence _METHOD_ of various arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ mutant lines and corresponding wild types mean values of total wax loads and coverage of individual compound classes are given with sds . chain length distribution of wax esters and of alkyl groups constituting these esters relative compositions are given for all four _PROTEIN_ mutant lines and col wild type based on single analyses that were in all cases confirmed in a second entirely independent experiment . a close examination of the chain length patterns within compound classes revealed that most of the individual wax compounds were unchanged in _PROTEIN_ . the most drastic effect was found for the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ primary alcohols all three compounds being reduced to trace amounts in the stem wax of all four mutant lines . in contrast primary alcohol still accumulated in the _PROTEIN_ cuticle reaching approximately of wild type levels . similar chain length patterns were found for the primary alcohols in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ whereas _PROTEIN_ showed a drastic reduction of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ alcohols and partially reduced amounts of _PROTEIN_ and alcohols . the alkyl esters of the wild type lines showed chain lengths ranging from to with a strong predominance of even numbered homologs and a maximum for . in contrast to this the mutant lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ had largely reduced levels of even numbered esters but not of odd numbered compounds . the remaining even numbered esters showed a bimodal distribution with maxima at and at to . the ester fraction was dominated by the ester which according to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ data consisted _PROTEIN_ of acid esterified with a _PROTEIN_ alcohol . because this is the predominant chain length of the secondary alcohols in arabidopsis stem wax it _METHOD_ very likely that this residual ester contains the secondary alcohols nonacosan ol and ol . these alcohols were not further analyzed in the _PROTEIN_ mutant esters because secondary alcohols are formed on the decarbonylation pathway without involvement of far enzymes and the acyl reduction pathway . the even numbered alkyl moieties of all the esters were quantified using _METHOD_ data and summarized according to the alcohol chain lengths present . whereas col wild type esters were dominated by _PROTEIN_ alkyl chains the mutant lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were characterized by drastically _PROTEIN_ amounts of this alcohol . instead they had notably increased levels of _PROTEIN_ and alcohols in their stem wax esters together with varying levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ alcohols . the wax of _PROTEIN_ showed an ester composition intermediate between wild type and the other three mutant lines . even though the total stem wax loads of the _PROTEIN_ plants were similar to wild type plants the _METHOD_ of all four mutant lines appeared glossy . this indicated that the epicuticular wax crystals on the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were affected by the mutations . because these crystals had not been reported for _PROTEIN_ plants before we examined the density and shape of wax crystals on _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ plants by scanning electron microscopy _PROTEIN_ . a dense array of epicuticular wax crystals consisting of vertical rods tubes longitudinal bundles of rodlets and horizontal reticulate platelets cover the stem surfaces of wild type arabidopsis . conversely the stem surfaces of _PROTEIN_ plants are almost devoid of wax crystals and instead have a _PROTEIN_ film of wax with a relatively smooth surface accounting for the change in surface light reflectance . both the wax chemical and the surface micromorphological phenotypes could be rescued by complementation with the _GENE_ genomic sequence providing further evidence that we have identified the _PROTEIN_ gene . to verify that _PROTEIN_ is an alcohol forming far involved in the production of very long chain primary alcohols we _PROTEIN_ the bp coding region of the _PROTEIN_ gene in saccharomyces under the control of the yeast _PROTEIN_ promoter . under inducing conditions cells transformed with an empty vector control accumulated and _PROTEIN_ fatty acids but no fatty alcohols could be detected . conversely yeast cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ produced two novel compounds . they were identified as primary alcohols _PROTEIN_ oh and _PROTEIN_ oh based on their gas chromatography behavior and _METHOD_ characteristics . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells also consistently accumulated greater levels of _PROTEIN_ fatty acid compared to the control yeast . no primary alcohols derived from saturated and monounsaturated and fatty acids could be detected . the subcellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ far was carried out in yeast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cdna n terminally tagged with green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter . the fusion of the _METHOD_ epitope to the _PROTEIN_ protein did not affect the far activity of the modified enzyme in yeast and allowed us to visualize it by confocal microscopy . this experiment revealed a _METHOD_ pattern typical of the yeast _LOCATION_ . counterstaining of yeast cells with hexyl rhodamine b a dye that can stain the _LOCATION_ outlined the same cellular domains confirming that _PROTEIN_ resides in the _LOCATION_ in yeast . the _PROTEIN_ transcript encodes a polypeptide of amino acids with an estimated molecular _METHOD_ of kd . the predicted _PROTEIN_ protein sequence is identical with the nadph dependent _LOCATION_ associated alcohol forming far from jojoba embryos and is identical in length . _PROTEIN_ exhibits extensive sequence similarities to arabidopsis _METHOD_ and the other six members of the arabidopsis far family . the coding sequences for the uncharacterized arabidopsis fars were obtained from annotated gene databases and then when necessary manually reannotated to obtain the more likely coding sequences and deduced polypeptide sequences . five of the arabidopsis fars are similar in size to _PROTEIN_ ranging from to residues in length . _GENE_ and _METHOD_ have amino terminal extensions of unknown function and are and residues in length respectively . _PROTEIN_ is the arabidopsis far most closely related to the biochemically characterized jojoba far . _PROTEIN_ is also highly related to the wheat anther specific protein _PROTEIN_ that has been shown to synthesize primary fatty alcohols thought to be important for pollen formation and function . in addition _PROTEIN_ shows short regions of amino acid identity to the functionally assessed pheromone gland far from silkmoth and two mouse enzymes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the jojoba far is thought to be an integral _LOCATION_ protein containing two _LOCATION_ spanning domains between residues to and between residues to . _PROTEIN_ has a similar number of hydrophobic residues in these two predicted segments . however hydropathy plots and other sequence analysis _METHOD_ do not reveal strong transmembrane domains anywhere in the _PROTEIN_ protein sequence . it thus remains uncertain whether these segments are true transmembrane regions in the far enzymes . the deduced _PROTEIN_ amino acid sequence also lacks the typical nad h binding motif or rossmann fold gxgxx . citation speculated that _METHOD_ binds nad h through a related nucleotide binding sequence x tgxtgfl and _PROTEIN_ contains this motif between residues and . semiquantitative rt pcr was used to investigate the transcription profile of the _PROTEIN_ gene in various whole tissues . aerial tissue samples were derived from week old arabidopsis plants and the root tissue sample from d old seedlings . _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in all tissues but to varying levels . highest transcript accumulation was detected in open flowers and roots . modest transcript levels were observed in _METHOD_ closed flowers and siliques low but consistently detectable _PROTEIN_ transcripts were observed in rosette and cauline leaves . to analyze the cell type _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ in detail the kb of genomic sequence immediately upstream of the _PROTEIN_ coding region was fused to the _PROTEIN_ reporter gene _PROTEIN_ and the construct was used to transform arabidopsis . tissue samples from independent transgenic lines were stained for gus activity with four of these lines being characterized in detail . consistent with rt pcr analysis reporter gene _PROTEIN_ was observed in both shoots and roots . in the stem _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ along the entire length exclusively in the epidermal cells . we confirmed the epidermis specific _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the inflorescence by in situ hybridization and observed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was confined to the region below the shoot apical and floral _METHOD_ . in rosette leaves _PROTEIN_ gus was strongly _PROTEIN_ in the trichomes which are specialized epidermal cells . this very restricted _PROTEIN_ pattern in leaves may explain the low levels of the _PROTEIN_ transcript present in whole leaf tissues because the transcript would be diluted by the surrounding pavement cells and underlying mesophyll cells . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in cauline leaves was more widespread being detected in trichomes pavement cells and the vasculature and was especially high at the base of the leaf . however this was not reflected by higher levels of total _PROTEIN_ detected by rt pcr using whole tissue samples from cauline leaves . in flowers _PROTEIN_ directed gus activity was detected in the _PROTEIN_ the filaments of the stamens and the carpel . in situ hybridization of the _PROTEIN_ transcript verified the _PROTEIN_ in the carpel and showed that this _PROTEIN_ was epidermis specific . in siliques _PROTEIN_ gus activity was present throughout the outer layer of the silique but no activity was observed in the seeds . unexpectedly we also detected _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the central and _PROTEIN_ roots of d old seedlings but not in the root tip . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was strongest in the elongation zone behind the root tip and appeared to diminish in the older sections of the differentiation zone . in the elongation zone gus activity was detected in all cell types although gus staining appeared more pronounced in the epidermal cells compared to interior cell types .

vortexed . after another min ml of nacl was added . following phase separation the chloroform phase was transferred to a fresh tube . the samples were evaporated to dryness under a stream of nitrogen
