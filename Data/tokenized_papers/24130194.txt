plant _LOCATION_ are highly dynamic organelles that mediate a suite of metabolic processes crucial to development . _LOCATION_ in seeds/dark grown seedlings and in photosynthetic tissues constitute two major subtypes of plant _LOCATION_ which had been postulated to contain distinct primary biochemical properties . multiple in depth proteomic analyses had been performed on leaf _LOCATION_ yet the major makeup of _LOCATION_ in seeds or dark grown seedlings remained unclear . to compare the metabolic pathways of the two dominant plant peroxisomal subtypes and discover new peroxisomal proteins that function specifically during seed germination we performed proteomic analysis of _LOCATION_ from etiolated arabidopsis seedlings . the detection of peroxisomal proteins allowed us to perform comparative analysis with the peroxisomal proteome of green leaves which revealed a large overlap between these two primary peroxisomal variants . subcellular targeting analysis by _METHOD_ microscopy validated around new peroxisomal proteins in arabidopsis . mutant analysis suggested the role of the cysteine protease response to in oxidation seed germination and growth . this work provides a much needed road map of a major type of plant _LOCATION_ and has established a basis for future investigations of peroxisomal proteolytic processes to understand their roles in development and in plant interaction with the environment .
to select a developmental stage that yields an adequate amount of tissue for organelle isolation but also coincides with the peak activity of _LOCATION_ we monitored the activity of _PROTEIN_ a marker enzyme for _LOCATION_ in seeds and early seedlings in to d old dark grown arabidopsis seedlings . consistent with a previous report the highest _PROTEIN_ activity was found to be present in d old seedlings which were thus chosen for subsequent _LOCATION_ isolation . _LOCATION_ purification was performed using a protocol adopted from the two density gradient centrifugation method developed for leaf _LOCATION_ and with some modifications of the percoll and suc concentrations . pellet from the percoll gradient which contained peak activity of _PROTEIN_ was washed and loaded onto the suc gradient . a distinctive white band was observed in the suc after the second gradient centrifugation which is similar to what we normally see for leaf _LOCATION_ isolation . to ascertain the composition of this band immunoblot analysis was performed on proteins from crude extract pellet fraction after percoll gradient centrifugation and the fraction that contained the white band after suc gradient centrifugation using organelle specific antibodies . antibodies against the chloroplast inner envelope protein _PROTEIN_ from pea and the mitochondrial outer _LOCATION_ localized voltage dependent anion selective channel protein from maize detected minimal presence of these proteins in the pe fraction compared with crude exact and . in contrast antibodies against the arabidopsis peroxisomal _LOCATION_ protein _PROTEIN_ revealed a high enrichment of this protein in the pe fraction . interestingly _PROTEIN_ which detected a single band of approximately kd in d old light grown seedlings consistently detected two bands around approximately kd in the etiolated samples . this pattern is similar to what was observed for the phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ proteins in the yeasts pichia pastoris and hansenula polymorpha . although whether this doublet is associated with protein phosphorylation has not yet been confirmed arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ has been found to be phosphorylated by multiple phosphoproteomic studies . as a second line of confirmation we also measured _PROTEIN_ activity in various fractions of the two gradients after centrifugation . as expected the pe fraction possessed a peak activity of _PROTEIN_ . in contrast fraction of the suc gradient which showed another peak _PROTEIN_ activity had much higher contamination from mitochondria as evidenced by the detection of a strong vdac band on the immunoblot . fraction was thus considered to contain broken _LOCATION_ . these results together suggested that our isolation procedure was successful in obtaining a fraction containing highly enriched _LOCATION_ that was fairly well separated from _LOCATION_ and mitochondria . consistent with previous reports on arabidopsis leaf _LOCATION_ fraction of the suc gradient contained highly enriched _LOCATION_ and was collected from subsequent peroxisomal preparations . after purity assessment by immunoblots peroxisomal samples were subjected to one dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by liquid chromatography tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . to maximize the coverage of peroxisomal proteins we employed three different approaches for protein separation . first approximately of total peroxisomal proteins was separated in a single lane on an _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gel which was _PROTEIN_ cut into slices . from two biological replicates we identified and proteins respectively . in the second approach we used a zoom ief fractionator a solution phase isoelectric focusing apparatus that can divide total proteins into different subgroups based on each protein s pi in an attempt to identify low abundance proteins that might have been masked by abundant proteins in the same gel lane in the first approach . approximately of peroxisomal proteins combined from three to four preparations was fractionated into five ph groups to to and to _PROTEIN_ to and to . proteins were then separated by de before each gel lane was cut into three to five slices depending on the amount of proteins in the lane . totals of and proteins were identified from to respectively . in the third experiment we enriched the peroxisomal _LOCATION_ fraction by treating approximately of total peroxisomal proteins combined from two to three preparations with mm and used the _LOCATION_ enriched sample for de after which the gel lane was sliced into eight pieces . a total of proteins was detected from this fraction . out of the proteins identified from and and were known to be peroxisomal thus there were still significant numbers of proteins from other subcellular compartments most notably _LOCATION_ and the secretory system which had been copurified with _LOCATION_ . to evaluate the enrichment of _LOCATION_ more precisely the relative abundance of proteins assigned to various subcellular organelles was compared using quantitative value . these values were derived from normalized spectral abundance _PROTEIN_ which normalize spectral counts according to the length of each protein and variation between sample runs . peroxisomal proteins accounted for in and in of the total proteins . notably subcellular distribution as well as spectral count based quantification of peroxisomal proteins in this study are comparable to the data reported for _LOCATION_ isolated from human liver tissue . zoom fractionation before de allowed us to detect additional peroxisomal proteins that were undetected in and including two new peroxisomal proteins _PROTEIN_ verified in this study and therefore significantly improved the coverage of the peroxisomal proteome . from the peroxisomal _LOCATION_ we identified peroxisomal proteins including integral _LOCATION_ proteins such as the _PROTEIN_ binding cassette transporter _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ that were undetected in the total peroxisomal samples using the first two approaches . altogether true peroxisomal proteins were identified from etiolated seedling _LOCATION_ including the proteins _PROTEIN_ validated in this study . these proteins covered all those identified from previous proteome studies of etiolated seedlings except for glyoxysomal protein plus an additional proteins representing more than fold improvement over previous peroxisomal proteome studies of the same tissue . z and m stand for total proteomics and zoom and _LOCATION_ proteomics respectively . mm predicted molecular _METHOD_ . for and qv percentage coverage and number of unique peptides are presented . individual proteomics experimental details can be found in supplemental tables to . the entire list of nonredundant proteins identified across seven experiments is presented in supplemental table . numbers refer to previously conducted plant _LOCATION_ proteomics experiments where to refer to citation citation citation citation citation citation citation and citation respectively . asterisks indicate newly identified peroxisomal proteins and y indicates proteins validated to be peroxisomal by subcellular targeting in this study . x presence absence . to identify new peroxisomal proteins and reveal previously unknown peroxisomal functions of etiolated seedlings we selected candidate proteins for in vivo subcellular targeting analysis . first for each protein on our list of nonredundant proteins identified from this study we queried the arabidopsis subcellular database _PROTEIN_ to retrieve data _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein localization identification in prior proteomics studies and predicted localization . using this information we excluded proteins that had experimentally proven nonperoxisomal _METHOD_ protein localization or had been repeatedly isolated from proteomics studies of other organelles . the remaining candidates were tested for subcellular localization . among them _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ had been found to be _LOCATION_ in a previous study but the c terminus was blocked in the fusion protein and badh was shown to target to punctate structures without a peroxisomal marker as a reference . thus these two proteins were retested in our study . to _PROTEIN_ proteins under the control of the promoter the coding region of each candidate gene was fused to enhanced yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ in the gateway compatible destination vectors generated in our previous study . proteins containing c terminal _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ like sequences were fused to the c terminus of _METHOD_ proteins with n terminal _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ like sequences were fused to the n terminus of _METHOD_ and those without recognizable _PROTEIN_ were cloned in both orientations . since minor _PROTEIN_ in plants are very diverse here we classified proteins with c terminal tripeptides that differed by one amino acid from the high targeting strength residues as _PROTEIN_ like . we used tobacco leaves to transiently coexpress the _METHOD_ fusion proteins and the peroxisomal marker cyan _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ . two days after inoculation of agrobacteria containing the constructs confocal laser scanning microscopy was performed to examine the subcellular localization of the fusion proteins in leaf epidermal cells . six proteins that contained _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ like sequences and had also been identified from previous peroxisomal proteomics but not validated acyl activating _PROTEIN_ short chain dehydrogenase/reductase isoform d _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ methionine _METHOD_ glycolate oxidase _PROTEIN_ a protein with unknown function and betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase colocalized with the peroxisomal marker . out of the proteins that contained _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ like sequences and were only identified in this proteomic study four of them _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ a ligase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ an ortholog of petunia phcnl _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the papain like cys proteinase _PROTEIN_ like and a protein with unknown function were localized to _LOCATION_ when fused to the c terminus of _METHOD_ . interestingly _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ appeared to encircle the _LOCATION_ in the form of a narrow strip at the center of the organelle . in contrast none of the proteins that contained no recognizable _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ like sequences were found to be _LOCATION_ localized . considering the presence of dual localized peroxisomal proteins we also reanalyzed a few proteins that had been categorized as contaminants in previous proteomic works . comparing our list of identified proteins with listed contaminants from previously conducted _LOCATION_ proteomics experiments we short listed five proteins that had the potential to be dual localized . among them glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ had a _PROTEIN_ like sequence and cys peroxiredoxin had a putative _PROTEIN_ . rab _PROTEIN_ homolog was included because of the reported association of rab proteins with _LOCATION_ in both plant and mammalian _METHOD_ . glutathione s transferase was chosen given that some of the glutathione s transferase _METHOD_ detected in plant _LOCATION_ proteomic experiments had been confirmed to be peroxisomal by localization studies . lastly aspartate was selected on the basis of the reported dual localization of another aminotransferase . confocal imaging showed that out of the five proteins only _PROTEIN_ displayed colocalization with the _LOCATION_ marker . consistent with previous reports using _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ we also observed strong _LOCATION_ signals for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . taken together of the proteins tested were confirmed to be peroxisomal and thus constituted new additions to arabidopsis peroxisomal proteins . seven proteins have been detected in _LOCATION_ isolated from leaves cell cultures and etiolated seedlings while _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were newly discovered in etiolated seedling _LOCATION_ . since _PROTEIN_ s function in benzoic acid biosynthesis has been shown we searched for homologous sequences in other species for _PROTEIN_ and all of which contained well established _PROTEIN_ . interestingly we could only locate homologous sequences of these proteins in plant lineages as opposed to _PROTEIN_ whose orthologs in other eukaryotic _METHOD_ had been characterized suggesting that these three proteins may carry out plant specific roles within _LOCATION_ . amino acid sequence analyses revealed that all of these homologous sequences have conserved _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ like sequences indicating that the corresponding proteins fulfill similar functions in plant peroxisomal metabolism . _PROTEIN_ s homologous sequences from fungal genomes carry experimentally validated _PROTEIN_ but their homologous sequences in plants exhibited great diversity in the c terminal tripeptide most of which are _PROTEIN_ like . to analyze the metabolic events that occur in _LOCATION_ of etiolated seedlings we compared the list of proteins identified in this study with those from two previously conducted major _LOCATION_ proteomic investigations . shared among the three peroxisomal proteomic experiments were proteins that covered all the major biochemical processes associated with leaf _LOCATION_ from oxidation and detoxification to photorespiration suggesting that the core _LOCATION_ proteome is largely conserved among _LOCATION_ from starkly different tissues . from this study only eight proteins appeared to be unique to _LOCATION_ of etiolated seedlings . among them were _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ enzymes that operate strictly in the glyoxylate cycle small heat shock protein acetyl _PROTEIN_ a and the newly identified _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and suggesting that besides the glyoxylate cycle there may also be a few biochemical processes more prevalent in seedling _LOCATION_ . _LOCATION_ in etiolated seedlings contained similar levels of core oxidation enzymes to those in leaf _LOCATION_ indicating that fatty acid oxidation is a major peroxisomal function throughout development . however some _METHOD_ of oxidation enzymes found in leaf as well as cell culture _LOCATION_ were undetected in this study . for example only four of the five functional acx _METHOD_ were detected . _PROTEIN_ the undetected isoform is involved in wound induced jasmonate biosynthesis . in the case of thiolases while _PROTEIN_ was only found in _PROTEIN_ was detected in all seven proteomics experiments which is in agreement with previous studies that showed _PROTEIN_ to be the major form of ketoacyl coa thiolase in seedlings . enoyl coa isomerase an important enzyme for the catabolism of unsaturated fatty acids with cis double bonds at odd numbered _PROTEIN_ is the only other major core oxidation component that was undetected in etiolated seedling _LOCATION_ . lastly for aaes and thioesterases enzymes catalyzing reactions pertaining to the core peroxisomal oxidation pathway only three of the nine known aaes and three of the six thioesterases were detected in our study possibly due to the low abundance of the undetected _METHOD_ or lack of their substrate . somewhat unexpectedly except for _PROTEIN_ we detected all the proteins implicated in peroxisomal steps of photorespiration suggesting that _LOCATION_ of etiolated seedlings may have begun to accumulate photorespiratory enzymes even before light perception or these enzymes have acquired nonphotorespiratory functions . _LOCATION_ in etiolated seedlings house most of the known antioxidative enzymes . however except for ascorbate _PROTEIN_ proteins of the peroxisomal ascorbate glutathione detoxification system including the previously identified _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and dhar were not detected in this study . this suggests that catalase and copper/zinc superoxide dismutase may have more prominent roles in eliminating ros species from seedling _LOCATION_ . the five member _PROTEIN_ family of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins oversees the early steps of _LOCATION_ division/proliferation . in contrast to leaf _LOCATION_ only three of the five members _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were detected in this study . _PROTEIN_ is induced by light therefore its absence in _LOCATION_ from dark grown seedlings was not unexpected . however we were intrigued by the lack of detection of _PROTEIN_ especially since we found the less abundant isoform _PROTEIN_ in this study . it has been speculated that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ have discrete roles in _LOCATION_ multiplication however their functions have proven difficult to tease apart . our data suggest that seedlings unexposed to light may _PROTEIN_ use _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to promote _LOCATION_ elongation . to determine whether genes encoding peroxisomal proteins of etiolated seedlings identified from this study confer any tissue specific _PROTEIN_ pattern we queried the botany array resource _PROTEIN_ browser with all genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ downloaded _PROTEIN_ normalized data for the relative _PROTEIN_ of these genes from the atgenexpress developmental time line data set and generated heat maps that clustered the peroxisomal genes based on their level of coexpression . consistent with their established role in the postgermination process genes encoding metabolic enzymes pertaining to oxidation and the glyoxylate cycle were strongly coexpressed in dry seeds and imbibed seeds . conversely photorespiratory enzyme genes appeared to be repressed at the same developmental stage . hierarchical clustering also grouped genes encoding proteins in distinct biochemical processes such as glyoxylate cycle oxidation and photorespiration in discrete groups . focusing on genes encoding proteins newly validated and proteins uniquely found in our study of etiolated seedlings we found that in line with their discovery in etiolated seedling _LOCATION_ the genes for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and were also highly _PROTEIN_ in dry seeds and imbibed seeds compared with other development time points or tissues . these results prompted us to examine the _PROTEIN_ patterns of these genes during germination in more detail . to dissect the _PROTEIN_ profiles of genes encoding peroxisomal proteins in etiolated seedlings in the course of germination we downloaded microarray data from a recent study that carried out extensive transcriptional profiling of arabidopsis seeds at crucial developmental intervals of the germination process . all genes in this data set could be ordered into one of four distinct clusters of gene _PROTEIN_ cluster genes steadily induced over the germination time course cluster stored transcripts highly _PROTEIN_ in the initial stages followed by a decline cluster genes exhibiting a characteristic _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ toward the end of stratification that lasted only up to a period of h of exposure to light and cluster genes with _PROTEIN_ level unchanged during germination . _PROTEIN_ normalized data were extracted for peroxisomal genes to generate a heat map . the same genes were analyzed using _PROTEIN_ which was previously classified as a cluster peroxisomal gene as a reference . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and were cluster genes up regulated during germination and continuing to be so well into post germination . the transcript abundance of and _PROTEIN_ in the germination/postgermination time period indicating that they were cluster genes . similar to the cluster gene _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed an _PROTEIN_ peak followed by a decline . akin to the marker genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and did not appear to vary greatly during germination so they were considered cluster genes . in summary the identification of some proteins only from this proteomic study of etiolated seedling _LOCATION_ seemed to be largely attributed to the much higher _PROTEIN_ level of their genes in seeds . to elucidate the functions of the newly validated peroxisomal proteins in plant development we resorted to a reverse genetics approach by analyzing the transfer dna insertion mutants of these genes . we were able to obtain homozygous mutants for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and . reverse transcription pcr analysis showed that while _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and appeared to be null retained partial _PROTEIN_ of the gene and interestingly a t dna insertion in the untranslated region of the _PROTEIN_ gene in _PROTEIN_ resulted in overexpression of the gene . given that oxidation of fatty acids is a major catabolic pathway contributing to _PROTEIN_ during germination mutants in oxidation components show compromised growth in the absence of exogenous suc during early development . to test whether any of these newly validated peroxisomal proteins were involved in fatty acid oxidation we measured the hypocotyl length of d old mutant seedlings grown in the dark on one half strength linsmaier and skoog medium with or without suc . although the control mutant _PROTEIN_ which is defective in _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ protein import displayed strong suc dependence no obvious deficiencies were observed for any of the tested mutants . since the conversion of iba to indole acetic acid also requires peroxisomal oxidation we checked if the mutants were disrupted in this aspect of _LOCATION_ metabolism by measuring growth inhibition of primary root in response to iba treatment . to this end mutant seedlings were grown on ls supplemented with different concentrations of iba and the length of primary root was measured after d. compared with wild type plants the two mutant alleles exhibited statistically significant resistance to iba whereas the overexpression line _PROTEIN_ showed hypersensitivity to iba . based on these data we predicted that both and _PROTEIN_ might play positive roles in peroxisomal oxidation . we also examined if the functions of the identified proteins extended to photorespiration by comparing the growth of the mutants in ambient air versus low _PROTEIN_ conditions . only exhibited noticeable differences in appearance under low _PROTEIN_ by showing strong growth inhibition and this phenotype could not be rescued by elevated _PROTEIN_ under which conditions plants were still small and had chlorotic and faster senescing leaves . thus these peroxisomal proteins do not seem to play strong roles in photorespiration and appears to be involved in nonphotorespiratory processes that impact plant growth under stress conditions . it has been proposed that peroxisomal metabolic pathways are an important determinant of germination potential and postgerminative seedling growth . considering the detection of these new proteins in seedling _LOCATION_ and the strong _PROTEIN_ for some of them during seed germination we investigated their roles in germination . since fresh seeds from all the mutants germinated normally on regular medium we quantified radicle emergence from the seeds in the presence of the phytohormone abscisic acid a known inducer of seed dormancy and inhibitor of germination . like the wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ showed steadily _PROTEIN_ radicle emergence with increased concentrations of aba . however both and were partially hypersensitive to aba indicating that possibly represses the aba response pathway in seed germination . interestingly after prolonged storage the germination rate of the mutant seeds dropped significantly in comparison with wild type plants and other mutants . within months of seed harvesting seed germination rate _PROTEIN_ approximately in the knockdown allele and approximately in the null allele supporting a role for in seed viability .

were homogenized using a mortar and pestle in grinding buffer that contained m tricine koh m suc bovine serum albumin mm edta mm dithiothreitol mm kcl mm polyvinylpyrrolidone mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor cocktail containing mm amino carproic acid mm benzamide and aprotinin leupeptin and peptatin . the homogenized sample was filtered through two layer miracloth to obtain crude extract and centrifuged at rpm _PROTEIN_ at for min to remove most chloroplasts . after discarding the pellet the supernatant was loaded onto the top of a percoll density gradient prepared in te
