the arabidopsis thaliana yellow _PROTEIN_ mutant is variegated due to lack of a chloroplast ftsh like metalloprotease _PROTEIN_ . we have generated suppressors of _PROTEIN_ variegation to gain insight into _PROTEIN_ and pathways that interact with _PROTEIN_ during chloroplast biogenesis . here we describe two such suppressors . suppression of variegation in the first line tag fn was caused by disruption of the _LOCATION_ gene _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ for a chloroplast localized homolog of pseudouridine synthase which isomerizes uridine to in noncoding rnas . _PROTEIN_ single mutants were epistatic to _PROTEIN_ and they displayed a phenotypic syndrome that included defects in chloroplast rrna processing reduced chloroplast translation reduced chloroplast protein accumulation and elevated chloroplast mrna levels . in the second line suppression of variegation was caused by a lesion in _PROTEIN_ the gene for the _PROTEIN_ subunit of the chloroplast clpp/r protease . like _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was epistatic to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants had a phenotype that resembled _PROTEIN_ . we propose that an impairment of chloroplast translation in tag fn and tag ie _PROTEIN_ the demand for _PROTEIN_ activity during chloroplast biogenesis and that this resulted in the suppression of _PROTEIN_ variegation . consistent with this hypothesis _PROTEIN_ variegation was repressed by chemical inhibitors of chloroplast translation . in planta mutagenesis revealed that _PROTEIN_ not only played a role in uridine isomerization but that its physical presence was necessary for proper chloroplast rrna processing . our data indicate that defects in chloroplast rrna processing are a common but not universal molecular phenotype associated with suppression of _PROTEIN_ variegation .
we previously reported the isolation of _PROTEIN_ suppressors using ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis . here we used t dna activation tagging as an alternative mutagenesis approach . this was accomplished by transforming plasmid into _PROTEIN_ a weak _PROTEIN_ allele . we observed a number of lines in which the and/or generations had altered variegation phenotypes due to gain of function or loss of function mutations . figures and show a line in which the plant was variegated but the plants were variegated or all green in an ratio . this indicated that suppression of variegation in this line was due to a recessive mutation . we named this locus _PROTEIN_ the mutant allele in tag fn was designated _PROTEIN_ . tag fn plants grew somewhat more slowly than wild type plants but they attained a normal stature at flowering . mature leaves of the tag fn plants had normal chlorophyll concentrations chlorophyll a/b ratios and chloroplast anatomies . these observations suggested that chloroplast biogenesis was not grossly altered in the tag fn suppressor line . to identify the suppressor gene in tag fn we performed cosegregation analysis to establish the linkage between the t dna insert and the mutant phenotype . dna gel blot analyses revealed that a kb hindiii band cosegregated with the suppression of variegation phenotype . this band was isolated by plasmid rescue and the rescued plasmid was sequenced . we recovered a bp arabidopsis genomic sequence flanking the t dna right border in the rescued plasmid that corresponded to a portion of intron of _GENE_ on chromosome . this suggested that _GENE_ was _PROTEIN_ . _GENE_ contains nine exons and eight introns and has been annotated as the gene for a amino acid protein that bears resemblance to members of the e. coli pseudouridine synthase family of enzymes . figure shows that tag fn _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ contained two _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ mrnas . the sizes of these transcripts were smaller than the mature sized mrnas in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . this conclusion was confirmed by rt pcr analyses showing that full length _PROTEIN_ transcripts did not accumulate in tag fn . it is possible therefore that _PROTEIN_ translation products retained function and that _PROTEIN_ was a knockdown rather than a knockout allele . the subsequent isolation of a more severe _PROTEIN_ allele _PROTEIN_ lent support to this conclusion . complementation tests were performed to confirm that suppression of _PROTEIN_ variegation in tag fn was due to the disruption of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . because tag fn was homozygous recessive at the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ loci _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ we reasoned that overexpression of a wild type copy of _PROTEIN_ in tag fn might mask the _PROTEIN_ defect thus restoring a variegation phenotype . to test this hypothesis we transformed tag fn with an overexpression construct that contained a full length _PROTEIN_ cdna driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . consistent with our hypothesis the transgenic plants were variegated . this was likely a consequence of _PROTEIN_ overexpression inasmuch as the transformants had dramatically increased _PROTEIN_ transcript levels . these data support the notion that a defect in _PROTEIN_ was responsible for the suppression of _PROTEIN_ variegation in the tag fn double mutants . to obtain _PROTEIN_ single mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ we backcrossed tag fn to wild type columbia and selfed the the were genotyped using derived cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence primers that detected mutant _PROTEIN_ sequences . figure shows that _PROTEIN_ single mutants were not variegated and that they resembled tag fn in morphology and growth habit . this indicated that _PROTEIN_ was epistatic to _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ allele contains a missense mutation in the aaa cassette domain of the protein . it is a leaky allele and accumulates _PROTEIN_ mrna and protein its variegation phenotype is less severe than that of _PROTEIN_ a putative null allele . _PROTEIN_ lacks detectable _PROTEIN_ mrna and protein due to a splice site mutation . to examine the allele specificity of _PROTEIN_ mediated variegation suppression we crossed _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ . figure shows that the double mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were not variegated and that they resembled tag fn . this indicated that the mechanism of _PROTEIN_ suppression was not allele specific and in addition that suppression of variegation did not require the presence of the _PROTEIN_ protein . because we could not rule out the possibility that _PROTEIN_ was a leaky allele we sought to identify a true knockout allele of this gene in the salk collection of t dna insertion mutants . several lines were identified one of which had an insertion in the first exon of the gene . homozygous plants of this line _PROTEIN_ were yellow green and significantly reduced in size compared with wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants . the leaves of _PROTEIN_ also remained pale green throughout their development . supplemental figure online shows that _PROTEIN_ was able to suppress the variegation phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ both double mutants resembled _PROTEIN_ single mutants . this confirmed that loss of function mutations in _PROTEIN_ were epistatic to _PROTEIN_ and that interactions between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins were not required for the suppression of _PROTEIN_ variegation phenotypes . taken together the observations in figure and supplemental figure online indicated that _PROTEIN_ was a more severe allele than _PROTEIN_ . consistent with this idea _PROTEIN_ transcripts could not be detected in this line by rna gel blot analysis . this indicated that _PROTEIN_ was a molecular null allele . as mentioned earlier _GENE_ has been annotated as a member of the arabidopsis pseudouridine synthase gene family . is the most abundant modified nucleotide in noncoding rna species including rrnas trnas small _LOCATION_ rnas and small nucleolar rnas it is not normally found in mrnas . the isomerization of uridine to is catalyzed by pseudouridine synthase . phylogenetic analyses were undertaken as a first step toward determining whether _PROTEIN_ was a bona fide pseudouridine synthase . pseudouridine synthases are best characterized in e. coli in which there are family members . these enzymes mediate uridine to isomerization in trnas and rrnas . e. coli pseudouridine synthases diverge widely in amino acid sequence yet they fold into similar structures . they also share a conserved nine amino acid motif at the active site that includes a universally conserved asp residue . this asp is perfectly conserved not only among e. coli pseudouridine synthases but also among all other pseudouridine synthases identified to date ranging from bacteria to yeast to humans . the frequency of amino acids within this motif in pseudouridine synthases from diverse sources is illustrated in figure . to determine the complement of pseudouridine synthases in arabidopsis we searched the databases for sequences with similarity to each of the e. coli proteins . twenty two homologous sequences were found . of these contained the active site motif with the perfectly conserved asp these included _PROTEIN_ . the phylogenetic relatedness of the e. coli arabidopsis and chlamydomonas pseudouridine synthases is illustrated in figure . the tree is complex but notable for the relative lack of phylogenetic pairs that have arisen as a consequence of duplications that occurred during the evolution of the arabidopsis genome as seen in many arabidopsis gene families including ftsh . on the basis of our phylogenetic analyses we concluded that _PROTEIN_ bore all of the hallmarks of a true pseudouridine synthase . _PROTEIN_ was predicted to be _LOCATION_ localized based on the presence of a putative transit peptide of amino acids . to confirm this localization we examined the intracellular location of a transiently _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ fusion construct in protoplasts isolated from wild type arabidopsis leaves the control was a _METHOD_ fusion construct . fusion protein _PROTEIN_ was monitored by confocal microscopy . figures to show control protoplasts that were transformed with _METHOD_ alone green _METHOD_ was present in the cytoplasm but was not associated with the chloroplast _METHOD_ consistent with this apparent lack of congruity the two _METHOD_ images did not merge . by contrast green _METHOD_ from the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein matched the pattern of chlorophyll _METHOD_ this was confirmed by the merging of the two images . these data indicated that _PROTEIN_ was a chloroplast protein . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ types other than chloroplasts we conducted rna gel blot analyses using rnas from various tissue types . as anticipated _PROTEIN_ was highly _PROTEIN_ in chloroplast containing tissues we suspect that floral _PROTEIN_ was from the sepals . _PROTEIN_ mrnas also accumulated in amyloplast containing root tissues but not in etioplast containing tissues of dark grown seedlings . we concluded that _PROTEIN_ was important for chloroplast development and _PROTEIN_ but that it likely functioned in other _LOCATION_ types as well . rrnas are the most abundant rna species in plant cells and _LOCATION_ rrnas and _LOCATION_ rrnas can be easily observed on ethidium bromide stained denaturing agarose gels . casual observation of rna gels such as those in figures and revealed that chloroplast rrna metabolism was likely affected in the tag fn suppressor line inasmuch as the abundant and kb rrna species were reduced in amount compared with the wild type and _PROTEIN_ . to examine the patterns of chloroplast rrna accumulation in tag fn in greater detail we conducted rna gel blot analyses using gene specific probes . the genes for chloroplast rrnas are located in the large inverted repeat region of land plant chloroplast genomes where they form part of the rrn operon . this operon which also includes two trna genes is transcribed as a large polycistronic rna that is processed by endoribonucleases and exoribonucleases to yield the mature rrna and trna species . figure shows that there was a dramatic shift in the stoichiometry of rrnas complementary to the probe in tag fn compared with the wild type _PROTEIN_ and the tag fn complementation line . this shift was due to a marked enhancement in levels of the three largest rrnas and to a sharp decline in levels of the four smaller rrna species . maturation of the and rrnas was also perturbed in tag fn levels of the mature rrnas were _PROTEIN_ while those of the precursor rrnas were increased . _LOCATION_ rrna levels were normal in all plants suggesting that the accumulation of _LOCATION_ rrnas was not affected in the mutants . considered together the data in figure indicated that tag fn was impaired in chloroplast rrna processing and that this defect was rescued in the tag fn complementation line . this supported the idea that defects in chloroplast rrna processing can be mediated by _PROTEIN_ . this was confirmed by examining profiles of chloroplast rrna accumulation in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutants . supplemental figure online shows that these profiles were qualitatively the same as those in tag fn but that there were quantitative differences in rrna accumulation between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in particular _PROTEIN_ had enhanced accumulation of the three largest rrnas and of the and rrna precursors as well as compensating _PROTEIN_ in the levels of the four smaller rrnas and of the mature and rrnas . these observations were consistent with the notion that _PROTEIN_ was a more severe allele than _PROTEIN_ . one question that arose was whether the alterations in _LOCATION_ rrna processing were indicative of a more global defect in rna metabolism in _PROTEIN_ plants . were patterns of mrna accumulation affected ? to address this question we performed rna gel blot analyses using representative _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ genes as probes . these included _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . two _LOCATION_ genes for _LOCATION_ proteins served as controls rbcs and _PROTEIN_ . figure shows that the transcript profiles of the two _LOCATION_ genes were quantitatively and qualitatively similar in the wild type _PROTEIN_ tag fn and the tag fn complementation line . the patterns of mrna accumulation were also qualitatively similar for each of the _LOCATION_ genes . this indicated that mrna processing per se was not likely altered in tag fn since genes that were transcribed as polycistronic mrnas then processed to their mature _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ had qualitatively similar mrna accumulation profiles . it was notable however that _LOCATION_ mrna levels were increased in tag fn by about twofold as estimated by comparing the amount of _PROTEIN_ mrna in tag fn to a titration series of _PROTEIN_ mrna accumulation in wild type plants . these increases were mediated by _PROTEIN_ inasmuch as they were reversed in the tag fn complementation line . considered together the data in figure suggested that _PROTEIN_ played a global role in _LOCATION_ mrna accumulation perhaps by affecting rates of transcription and/or turnover . we were next interested in determining whether a lack of _PROTEIN_ affected chloroplast protein accumulation . for these experiments we conducted immunoblot studies on leaf proteins from the wild type _PROTEIN_ tag fn _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ using antibodies against representative photosynthetic proteins psbp and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the rieske fe s protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and ls . we also probed the blots with antibodies against _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . consistent with the nearly normal chlorophyll levels and chlorophyll a/b ratios in tag fn and _PROTEIN_ the data in figure showed that chloroplast protein levels were very similar in _PROTEIN_ tag fn and _PROTEIN_ . exceptions were _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which were dramatically reduced in amount in _PROTEIN_ and tag fn . this was as expected for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interact to form oligomeric complexes in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and when one of these proteins is produced in excess it is degraded to match the abundance of the others . the _PROTEIN_ that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were coordinately reduced in amount in tag fn indicated that suppression of _PROTEIN_ variegation in this line was not due to an enhancement of _PROTEIN_ and/or of _PROTEIN_ protein abundance . in contrast with _PROTEIN_ some of the _LOCATION_ proteins in figure were markedly reduced in amount . for instance we consistently observed reductions of in _PROTEIN_ the rieske fe s protein _PROTEIN_ and ls . this suggested that _PROTEIN_ was capable of influencing chloroplast protein accumulation . the data in figures and were consistent with the idea that defects in _PROTEIN_ resulted in higher than normal chloroplast mrna levels but _PROTEIN_ abundance of at least some chloroplast proteins . this suggested that translation was impaired in the _PROTEIN_ mutants . this might not be unexpected since chloroplast rrna processing defects of the sort documented for _PROTEIN_ have previously been correlated with defects in _LOCATION_ ribosome assembly and translation . to test this hypothesis we pulse labeled wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants with met for min . in this system the ls is the most abundant labeled protein in the soluble fraction and the protein of psii is the most abundant labeled protein in the _LOCATION_ fraction . figures and show that the amounts of labeled ls and that accumulate during the pulse were markedly reduced in _PROTEIN_ . this was consistent with the notion that chloroplast translation was reduced in _PROTEIN_ . to test whether translation defects were able to suppress _PROTEIN_ variegation we treated _PROTEIN_ with chemical inhibitors of chloroplast translation including chloramphenicol which prevents the binding of amino acyl trna to the a site on the subunit of ribosomes and spectinomycin which prevents translocation of the peptidyl trna from the a site to the p site on the subunit of ribosomes . we found that high concentrations of these inhibitors were lethal but that sublethal concentrations were able to suppress the variegation phenotype of _PROTEIN_ . as mentioned earlier pseudouridine synthases contain a short stretch of nine amino acids in their active sites that includes a perfectly conserved asp residue . mutations of this residue abolish the ability of pseudouridine synthase to isomerize uridine to in e. coli . this asp corresponds to amino acid of the _PROTEIN_ gene product . we wanted to take advantage of our molecular null allele _PROTEIN_ to ask whether in vitro mutagenized copies of _PROTEIN_ that contained substitutions of this residue could complement the _PROTEIN_ defect thus normalizing the mutant phenotype . figure shows results from a representative experiment in which asp was mutagenized in vitro to asn _PROTEIN_ a substitution of a charged residue with a similarly sized uncharged residue . the mutant form of _PROTEIN_ was transformed into _PROTEIN_ under the control of the camv promoter the transformants were designated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . transformation of _PROTEIN_ with a wild type _PROTEIN_ cdna served as a control _PROTEIN_ . figure shows that both sets of transgenic plants resembled the wild type _PROTEIN_ . this correlated with high levels of mrna _PROTEIN_ from both transgenes . figure further shows that the rrna processing defects in _PROTEIN_ were reversed in the overexpressors . this is consistent with our earlier data showing that _PROTEIN_ is necessary for normal chloroplast rrna processing . figure shows that overexpression of wild type _PROTEIN_ was able to restore a variegated phenotype to the tag fn suppression line . to test whether the active site asp was necessary for this restoration we transformed tag fn with the _PROTEIN_ construct . figure shows that the transformants were variegated . this suggested that _PROTEIN_ like wild type _PROTEIN_ was able to complement the _PROTEIN_ defect in tag fn . also like the tag fn lines in which wild type _PROTEIN_ was overexpressed the rrna processing defect in tag fn was normalized in the _PROTEIN_ overexpression lines . this indicated that asp which is required for the isomerization of uridine to was not required for _LOCATION_ rrna processing . however _LOCATION_ rrna processing appeared to require the presence of the _PROTEIN_ protein per se . during the course of our _PROTEIN_ suppressor screens we identified a t dna tagged line with a chloroplast rrna processing defect similar to that of _PROTEIN_ . tag ie plants were smaller than normal and had a pronounced virescent phenotype with newly emerged leaves having a bright yellow coloration . we found that tag ie suppressed _PROTEIN_ in a recessive manner and that the tag ie suppressor phenotype cosegregated with a complex t dna structure . dna gel blot analyses revealed that this structure was likely composed of multiple rearranged t dnas . we named the suppressor locus _PROTEIN_ and the mutant allele in tag ie _PROTEIN_ . homozygous _PROTEIN_ plants had the same virescent phenotype as tag ie indicating that _PROTEIN_ was epistatic to _PROTEIN_ in tag ie . due to the complex nature of the t dna insertion in _PROTEIN_ we failed to isolate the gene via plasmid rescue and thus turned to map based cloning procedures . bulked segregant analysis of a mapping population obtained by crossing tag ie with landsberg _LOCATION_ showed that _PROTEIN_ was genetically linked to molecular markers and on chromosome . using a candidate gene approach we noted that this region of chromosome contained genes for a number of putative and identified _LOCATION_ proteins including _GENE_ the gene for the _PROTEIN_ subunit of the chloroplast clp protease complex . it has been suggested that clp protease core complexes which are composed of clpp/r/s subunits are involved in general protein turnover in _LOCATION_ . we focused our attention on _PROTEIN_ because previously described _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants have a virescent phenotype similar to that of _PROTEIN_ . to test whether _PROTEIN_ defined the gene for _PROTEIN_ we performed allelism tests between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ a t dna insertion allele . we found that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ failed to complement one another suggesting that they were allelic . to confirm this hypothesis we examined whether the _PROTEIN_ gene in tag ie contained a t dna structure . this was accomplished by pcr analysis of genomic dna from tag ie using three pairs of primers that spanned the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ gene . figure shows that the and primer pair failed to amplify a genomic dna fragment consistent with the idea that an insertion resided between these two primers . we also failed to detect a _PROTEIN_ transcript in tag ie via rt pcr using _PROTEIN_ primers that would have amplified the entire gene . this indicated that the _PROTEIN_ allele in tag ie was likely a molecular null . considered together the data in figure supported the idea that _PROTEIN_ encoded _PROTEIN_ . molecular characterization of _PROTEIN_ has been performed in the _PROTEIN_ laboratory . their studies showed that this mutant has many similarities to _PROTEIN_ . first it accumulates higher molecular weight _METHOD_ of chloroplast and rrnas suggesting that it is impaired in chloroplast rrna processing . second it has normal levels of mrna from several representative _LOCATION_ genes but reduced protein accumulation . to explain these findings citation suggested that chloroplast rrna maturation and translation are linked and that chloroplast translation is inhibited in _PROTEIN_ . again this is similar to our conclusions _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the question arose whether defects in _LOCATION_ rrna processing were universally associated with the suppression of _PROTEIN_ variegation . to address this question we examined chloroplast rrna profiles in various suppressors of _PROTEIN_ we had generated the suppressors described below were all recessive . supplemental figure online shows that three suppressors had profiles that resemble the wild type _PROTEIN_ tag _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . by contrast other suppressor lines had rrna processing defects similar to those in tag fn _PROTEIN_ and tag ie . these included _PROTEIN_ a mutant that lacks the _PROTEIN_ chaperone which could suppress _PROTEIN_ variegation at early stages of seedling development . we concluded that not all _PROTEIN_ suppressors had defects in chloroplast rrna processing .
