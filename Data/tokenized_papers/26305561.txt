previously a translational fusion to the entire b. napus bnolnb was shown to transfer the active enzyme to the brassica pollen coat . this study confirmed that bnolnb undergoes proteolytic cleavage and showed that the gus enzyme was targeted to the pollen coat attached to the cd . bnolnb displays limited sequence identity to any of the nine arabidopsis thaliana except in the hd where the highest similarity is to _PROTEIN_ . was introduced into arabidopsis to determine whether the b. napus would be targeted correctly to the pollen coat of another brassicaceae species despite large differences in protein sequence . the translational fusion did target the gus enzyme to the arabidopsis pollen coat unlike a transcriptional fusion between the bnolnb tapetal promoter and the gus gene . these results complement a recent study showing the reverse situation where an arabidopsis was properly targeted in b. napus . although the proteolytically cleaved cd has been detected in the brassicaceae pollen coat the nf has been assumed to be mostly degraded as the tapetosomal tags disappear . to determine the fate of the cleaved nf a translational gus fusion to the entire bnolnb protein was constructed and introduced into arabidopsis . this construct also led to the targeting of the gus protein to the pollen coat although it is possible that the fusion did not undergo proteolytic cleavage and targeting of the gus fusion resulted from the persisting cd . to rule out this possibility a translational fusion was constructed consisting only of the bnolnb nf and gus . as shown in fig . gus enzyme activity could still be detected on transgenic pollen and this activity could be removed by extracting the pollen coat with cyclohexane as with . altogether the above results suggest that both the nf and cf of the b. napus bnolnb can target gus to the pollen coat of another brassicaceae species . all nine arabidopsis genes have recently been shown to be _PROTEIN_ albeit at different levels . unlike the brassica there is little information _PROTEIN_ the targeting and processing of the arabidopsis . arabidopsis vary considerably in size and composition due largely to differences in their cd and we selected the two most abundant which also represent the smallest _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the largest _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ detected in the arabidopsis pollen coat for the construction of the gus translational fusions _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . in different transgenic arabidopsis lines both constructs exhibited gus activity in the tapetum early in anther development and _PROTEIN_ in the pollen coat . as expected the transcriptional fusion also showed gus activity in the tapetum but none associated with the pollen grain . therefore despite vast differences in size and amino acid composition both the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ can effectively target the active gus protein to the arabidopsis pollen coat . gus is a stable protein whose enzymatic assays are destructive we therefore tested whether _METHOD_ could be targeted to the pollen coat and not only _PROTEIN_ activity in that _LOCATION_ environment but also allow studies of living tissues . _METHOD_ was fused as a translational fusion to the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and introduced into arabidopsis . as with the gus translational fusions _METHOD_ _METHOD_ can be detected within the tapetum early in anther development with both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ and is associated with discrete organelles within the intact tapetum . this _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ pattern contrasts with that of _METHOD_ a _METHOD_ transcriptional fusion to the b. napus pollen polygalacturonase sta promoter and of untransformed plants where _METHOD_ is not detected within the tapetum . upon tapetum degeneration both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ display _METHOD_ _METHOD_ distributed within the anther locule presumably associated with tapetosomal debris in transit to the pollen cell wall . this differs from results obtained with _METHOD_ where _METHOD_ _METHOD_ is confined to the pollen grain or from untransformed plants . _PROTEIN_ in pollen development _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected on the mature pollen surface with _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ unlike _METHOD_ . the _METHOD_ findings confirm results recently reported with a similar _METHOD_ fusion based on the cdna sequence and further demonstrate that the much smaller _PROTEIN_ can also target _METHOD_ to the pollen coat . the and tags are thought to be synthesized within the _LOCATION_ network and to converge towards centers of the _LOCATION_ where coated lipid droplets _PROTEIN_ generated by budding associate tightly with _LOCATION_ vesicles mostly via ionic interactions . the hd of the is believed to anchor the proteins within the _PROTEIN_ tags and indeed were shown to be specifically associated with isolated _PROTEIN_ by tapetosome fractionation although the in vivo of and _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis tapetosomes has recently been questioned . transmission electron microscopy immunogold labeling was performed using an antibody raised against _METHOD_ to verify the subcellular localization of the translational fusions _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . the results obtained with the two fusions were very similar and showed the _METHOD_ protein first localized specifically within the tapetosomes and associated primarily with a network of structures previously described as fibrils or strings of beads . this localization is consistent with tem results obtained with antibodies raised against the native brassica bnolnb and bnolnb and with the demonstration that these granules contain basic proteins as are basic . depending on the method of fixation and osmoticum tapetosomes vary considerably in appearance during tem analysis complicating attempts to decipher their internal organization and to correlate different studies . the occurrence of the strings of beads is typical of tapetosomes chemically fixed in the absence of osmium to retain antigenicity . these strings of beads make up a network which based on the section appears around the edge of the tapetosome or meshes it entirely probably also depending on the extent of fixation . they are present within an electron translucent _PROTEIN_ with greyish stacks often visible . the strings of beads closely resemble isolated tapetosomal vesicles shown to contain _LOCATION_ marker proteins . therefore localization of the to the strings of beads would indicate an intimate association of these proteins with both the tapetosomal _LOCATION_ network and _PROTEIN_ with the stronger interaction with the _PROTEIN_ via the hd possibly explaining why they mostly upon tapetosome fractionation . the notion that can interact with different tapetosome constituents is further supported by the recent demonstration that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the tapetum of cleome hassleriana led to the de novo association of _PROTEIN_ and vesicles to form primitive tapetosomes . a younger stage of anther development was intentionally chosen for _METHOD_ to illustrate the clustering of smaller tapetosomes often observed in earlier stages of tapetum development whereas a more mature stage was chosen for _METHOD_ . the younger tapetosomes appear to fuse to form larger mature tapetosomes and often displayed a boundary which could also sometimes be seen around mature tapetosomes . a boundary surrounding mature tapetosomes has been described previously but other studies reported the absence of such a boundary . following tapetum degeneration the _METHOD_ protein was detected within the pollen coat with both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ consistent with the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ patterns observed above as well as results obtained with the native brassica bnolnb and bnolnb . to examine whether the arabidopsis are proteolytically cleaved following tapetal breakdown as demonstrated for their brassica counterparts western blot analyses were performed with three different antibodies raised specifically against either the _PROTEIN_ nf _PROTEIN_ cf or _METHOD_ . as shown in fig . early in development the _METHOD_ antibody detected the _METHOD_ fusion at a much higher molecular _METHOD_ than predicted for the full _METHOD_ fusion . brassica are known to migrate above their predicted molecular _METHOD_ . in _PROTEIN_ a recent study showed that a full _METHOD_ fusion migrated comparably but in this report the smaller _METHOD_ fragment expected from the cleavage of the kd nf was not detected _PROTEIN_ in anther development . similarly this _METHOD_ fragment was difficult to observe in anthers obtained at the mm bud stage containing tricellular pollen grains but became evident following mature pollen coat isolation although some of it had undergone an additional proteolytic cleavage releasing _METHOD_ in free form . both and cleavage of _METHOD_ in fusion constructs releasing a _METHOD_ core protein have been observed previously . since free _METHOD_ and derived smaller proteolytic products are enriched in the pollen coat extract proteolysis is likely to have occurred once the fusion was associated to the pollen coat as translational fusion to is required for _METHOD_ transfer to the pollen coat . these results imply that proteolytic activity persists _PROTEIN_ in anther/pollen development possibly ensuring that only specific tapetal proteins persist in the pollen coat . very little information is known _PROTEIN_ this selective proteolysis . the _METHOD_ antibody also detected the smaller _METHOD_ fusion _METHOD_ which unlike _METHOD_ migrated close to its predicted molecular _METHOD_ suggesting that molecular _METHOD_ inconsistencies are largely due to the basic cd which is typically considerably larger than that of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ in development the nf was cleaved yielding an _METHOD_ fusion of the expected size in the pollen coat . an identical western blot analysis was performed with the antibody specific to the _PROTEIN_ cd . in untransformed plants the antibody could detect the endogenous _PROTEIN_ protein as well as the cleaved version lacking the nf close to previously observed sizes . the occurrence of several bands using antibodies derived against native is not unusual in anther extracts and may represent alternative _METHOD_ of these proteins . oligomerization of seed oleosins has been reported previously and may extend to the for example the band above kd may represent a dimer of _PROTEIN_ . alternatively the large proteins may reflect an incomplete dissociation of protein lipid interactions by _PROTEIN_ before electrophoresis . the majority of these additional bands are missing in the pollen coat suggesting that following proteolytic cleavage interactions are modified concurrent with _PROTEIN_ breakdown . in arabidopsis lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the cd antibody detected the same fusion protein bands detected with the _METHOD_ antibody . since the antibody was raised against a peptide unique to the _PROTEIN_ cd it does not detect the cf of _PROTEIN_ thus both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ had a pattern similar to wt showing the endogenous _PROTEIN_ proteins . the antibody against the _PROTEIN_ nd could also detect the uncleaved _METHOD_ fusion and attempts to detect the released nf were inconclusive . to our knowledge the cleaved _PROTEIN_ nf has never been detected immunologically and this may indicate that it is either degraded or that following cleavage it is no longer or extracted . nonetheless upon tapetal degeneration both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ undergo proteolytic cleavage releasing the nf and cf fragments confirming that this cleavage occurs outside brassica . these results also signify that targeting of _METHOD_ to the pollen coat in _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ occurred as a fusion to the cd . the demonstration that the highly variable arabidopsis are also proteolytically cleaved should foster further efforts to identify putative conserved cleavage sites . it would be interesting to prevent this proteolysis for example by mutagenesis of the cleavage site and evaluate whether it is necessary for the to exert their functions within the tapetosome and the pollen coat . it has been proposed that the length and hydrophobicity of the hd results in the cd being located on the _LOCATION_ surface of the _LOCATION_ . the occurrence of the nd and cd on the _LOCATION_ side of the _PROTEIN_ is also thought to be critical to their stability and _PROTEIN_ may represent a minimal version of such an arrangement given that it possesses the smallest nd and cd of all the arabidopsis . the first c. aa of the seed oleosin cd are thought to interact horizontally with charged groups of the phospholipid layer and the first aa have been shown to resist proteolytic cleavage presumably due to a tight association with the phospholipid bilayer . a strong interaction with the phospholipid layer might explain the ability of such a small _PROTEIN_ cd to target much larger proteins like gus and _METHOD_ to the pollen coat in the absence of the anchoring hd although it is not known if this interaction persists following tapetal breakdown . given that an _PROTEIN_ knockout displays defective tapetosomes as well as pollen grains more susceptible to dehydration this evidently _METHOD_ critical functions in spite of its very small size . the results from the fusions containing the nd and hd of the brassica bnolnb described above suggest that this fragment can to the pollen coat . however the presence of the _PROTEIN_ nf could not be confirmed via western blot analysis of anther or pollen coat proteins . therefore _METHOD_ a fusion of the _PROTEIN_ first exon and _METHOD_ was constructed and introduced into arabidopsis . during anther development _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was first detected in the intact tapetum then the anther locule upon tapetal degeneration and finally the coat of the mature pollen grain albeit at a consistently lower level among different transgenic lines than observed for _METHOD_ which is the equivalent construct containing the full length _PROTEIN_ . since the nf comprises the conserved hd first described in seed oleosins the equivalent seed oleosin nf encoded by exon of the arabidopsis kd oleosin gene _PROTEIN_ was fused to _METHOD_ under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter _METHOD_ and transformed into arabidopsis to determine whether the seed oleosin _METHOD_ translational fusion would also find its way to the pollen coat . equivalent _PROTEIN_ fusions were shown to be targeted correctly to the _LOCATION_ and to oil bodies in seeds . the anthers of arabidopsis lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ displayed a pattern of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the anther and pollen coat that was very similar to that observed for _METHOD_ . to determine the subcellular localization of the _METHOD_ fusions immunogold labeling experiments were performed using the _METHOD_ antibody on anther tissues _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ . results obtained with _METHOD_ showed gold particles in the tapetosomes that were not necessarily associated with the strings of beads and were often located on light grey stacks whereas _PROTEIN_ they were reproducibly found within the mature pollen coat although at a lower number than with _METHOD_ . interestingly the tapetosomes found in arabidopsis lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ remained small reminiscent of the earlier stages of tapetosome development . given that _METHOD_ differs from _METHOD_ only by the absence of the cd it is likely that the phenotype is due to the replacement of the cd by _METHOD_ and that the cd is thus important to tapetosome biogenesis . interestingly arabidopsis lines lacking _PROTEIN_ were shown to have smaller tapetosomes and _METHOD_ could notionally be viewed as a defective _PROTEIN_ . immunolabeling results obtained with _METHOD_ demonstrated that the seed oleosin nf does target _METHOD_ specifically to the tapetosome with the majority of the gold particles associated with the light grey stacks and not the strings of beads . however unlike _METHOD_ the _METHOD_ mature tapetal cells contained large tapetosomes of normal appearance . the _METHOD_ protein could _PROTEIN_ be detected within the pollen coat of arabidopsis lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the light grey stacks were often found in close association with the strings of beads when these were present and may correspond to a different form of the _LOCATION_ network or sectioned perspective . quilichini et al . used of arabidopsis tapetosomes to reveal their complex internal organization which they described as bundles of tightly associated linear tubes occurring within an intricate _PROTEIN_ of coiled fibrils and these might correspond to the light grey stacks and _LOCATION_ network . targeting within the tapetosomes appears to be affected in lines _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ fusions and this may be due to the _PROTEIN_ that _METHOD_ can not fully mimic the cd for example it provides a more hydrophobic context in the first amino acids immediately following the hd than is found in the oleosin or used in this study . this difference may affect the strong interaction with the phospholipid layer described above and impede proper _PROTEIN_ formation . whether tapetosomes get larger by individually expanding fusing together or both it is evident that _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ fusion causes the majority to remain discrete and small . if _METHOD_ reaches a certain level around an _PROTEIN_ it is possible that it interrupts stable _PROTEIN_ expansion by modifying protein protein or protein phospholipid interactions . another possibility could be that _METHOD_ prevents _PROTEIN_ expansion and the inability of _PROTEIN_ to fuse might in turn be important to tapetosome fusion . a recent study has implicated specific oleosins in the control of seed _PROTEIN_ fusion . interestingly _PROTEIN_ used in _METHOD_ was shown to prevent _PROTEIN_ fusion and yet unlike _METHOD_ transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ nf had large tapetosomes . it is conceivable that a full length _PROTEIN_ is necessary to prevent fusion that it does not function similarly in tapetosomes or that tapetosomal _PROTEIN_ do not fuse at all . nevertheless how does one account for the variation in the tapetosome phenotype between plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ ? the _PROTEIN_ difference between the nfs from _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is the presence of a stretch of amino acids high in hydrophobic residues in the _PROTEIN_ nd just before the conserved hd that is absent in the hydrophilic _PROTEIN_ nd . an hydrophobic extension of the conserved hd is present in most arabidopsis tapetal and in _PROTEIN_ short nds tend to be mostly hydrophobic _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and not truly hydrophilic/amphipathic as prescribed by the archetype oleosin . presumably this would significantly alter their topology on the _LOCATION_ which could in turn impact _PROTEIN_ formation especially given that some of these are relatively abundant . further investigations will be required to test whether a hydrophobic extension of the hd in the nf plays a role in tapetosome formation . western blot analyses were performed to confirm the _METHOD_ microscopy and immunolabeling results obtained with the _METHOD_ fusions . earlier in development the _METHOD_ antibody detected both the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusions at close to their expected molecular _METHOD_ but _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ fusion was mostly cleaved to release the _METHOD_ protein . the presence of _METHOD_ within the pollen coat again implies that the cleavage of _METHOD_ occurred following the transfer of the fusion to the pollen whereas its absence with _METHOD_ suggests that either the cleavage site was absent or the fusion was inaccessible to the protease . as there is very little similarity among all the constructs in the sequences preceding _METHOD_ congruent upstream cleavage is difficult to rationalize although this dissimilarity might explain the varying degrees of _METHOD_ cleavage . a comparison of the intensity of the uncleaved protein bands with the _METHOD_ antibody early in development in lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ which are similar in size indicates that differences in the level of fusion protein _PROTEIN_ in the transgenic plants analyzed may not account entirely for the lower _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and immunogold labeling obtained with the _METHOD_ fusions . this is further supported by the _PROTEIN_ that both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ have equivalent if not higher levels of transcripts than _METHOD_ . although the _METHOD_ fusions may have lower or accessibility in situ they do not appear to be _PROTEIN_ degraded . in _PROTEIN_ marker fusion may protect the nf from degradation and targeting to the pollen coat may be associated with remaining tags found there . western blot analysis with the cd antibody gave results equivalent to those obtained with untransformed plants as _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ lack this domain . analysis using the _PROTEIN_ nd antibody detected the _METHOD_ fusion although the nf was not detected in the anther or pollen coat following cleavage of the _METHOD_ protein . weakly hybridizing protein bands that may have represented the nf were analyzed by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ but yielded different proteins . an antibody raised against the nd of bnolnb also failed to detect the nf following tapetal degeneration in b. napus . the effect on tapetosome development and targeting observed in the arabidopsis lines _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ fusions prompted the immunolabeling analysis of lines _PROTEIN_ which is the equivalent brassica bnolnb nf fusion but with the cd replaced by gus as opposed to _METHOD_ . gold particles associated with the gus antibody showed an unexpected distribution in tapetal cells . earlier in development a large number of particles were spread throughout the cell associating with what appeared to be the _LOCATION_ whereas few were found in young tapetosomes . _PROTEIN_ in tapetum development the signal was less dispersed and associated with unusual structures appearing to be dense accumulations of _LOCATION_ with again little signal detected within what seemed like normal large mature tapetosomes . these results suggest that _LOCATION_ containing the fusion is largely excluded from normal tapetosome development and it is tempting to speculate that the defect observed with reflects an inability to form _PROTEIN_ as no electron translucent lipids are evident within the immunoreactive _LOCATION_ agglomerations . the formation of the _LOCATION_ agglomerations may be an exaggerated version of _LOCATION_ cisternae converging to form centers and supports the premise that are involved in the amalgamation of _LOCATION_ cisternae at these centers . in view of the _PROTEIN_ that gus activity can be detected on the pollen of lines transformed with despite little signal being associated with the tapetosomes it is possible that some gus enzyme is relocated to the pollen coat either via association with components of the _LOCATION_ agglomerations or the persistence of the nf fusion following tapetal degeneration . _METHOD_ and nf fusions had more noticeable effects on tapetosome development than _METHOD_ consisting of the seed oleosin nf . as mentioned above the hds from _PROTEIN_ and bnolnb are quite similar and this similarity does extend to the hd hydrophobic extension in _PROTEIN_ it is the only region of the nd showing significant similarity . given that plants _PROTEIN_ the gus fusion to the full length bnolnb seemed to have normal tapetosomes the defect in is likely due to the replacement of the cd with gus . generally gus is larger and more amphipathic than the hydrophilic bnolnb cd and this might contribute to the phenotype although replacing the seed oleosin _PROTEIN_ hydrophilic cd with gus did not prevent targeting to oil bodies . to evaluate the possible effect of the size of the gus protein on the tapetosome phenotype immunolabeling analysis was performed on tapetal cells of _PROTEIN_ which is equivalent to _METHOD_ but with gus fused to the _PROTEIN_ rather than _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ showed normal tapetosome development but _PROTEIN_ exhibited immunoreactive _LOCATION_ agglomerations very similar to those observed with but unlike more gold particles were found associated with the tapetosomes . these results suggest that when comparing _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ the greater size of the gus protein compared to _METHOD_ can hinder normal _LOCATION_ involvement in tapetosome biogenesis and cause _LOCATION_ agglomerations where accumulate . _PROTEIN_ therefore _METHOD_ to be an intermediate phenotype between and _METHOD_ . these different phenotypes not only reveal the complexity of the involvement of the domains in tapetosome formation but also validate the value of fusions in dissecting this process . lastly to ascertain whether some of the observed tapetal phenotypes were correlated with differences in pollen coat deposition mature pollen grains from plants _PROTEIN_ the different fusion constructs were examined by tem in the presence of osmium . most lines displayed pollen coats that appeared similar to that of untransformed plants . the pollen coat _METHOD_ quite tolerant to compositional changes as a deletion completely removing _PROTEIN_ seemed to have no effect on its appearance . nonetheless _METHOD_ did show differences from untransformed plants in that the pollen coat was often difficult to fix even in the presence of osmium and when fully fixed often showed differences in intine appearance . the effect on the intine is reminiscent of the phenotype observed in transgenic arabidopsis lines with reduced levels of tapetal type iii lipid transfer proteins that become part of the pollen coat . novel insight into the proteolytic processing and subcellular targeting of the highly variable was obtained using marker protein fusions _PROTEIN_ in the tapetum of transgenic arabidopsis . this approach also revealed the critical role of individual domains in tapetosome formation and should represent an invaluable tool in deciphering this evidently complex process .
