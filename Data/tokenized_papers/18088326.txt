the role of guard cell chloroplasts in stomatal function is controversial . it is usually assumed that stomatal closure is preceded by a transient increase in _LOCATION_ free concentration in the guard cells . here we provide the evidence that chloroplasts play a critical role in the generation of _LOCATION_ induced cyt transients and stomatal closure in arabidopsis . cas is a plant specific putative binding protein that was originally proposed to be a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized external sensor . in the present study we characterized the intracellular localization of cas in arabidopsis with a combination of techniques including in vivo localization of green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fused gene _PROTEIN_ subcellular fractionation and fractional analysis of cas with western blots and database analysis of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteomes . each technique produced consistent results . cas was localized _PROTEIN_ to chloroplasts . it is an integral _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein and the n terminus acidic binding region is likely exposed to the stromal side of the _LOCATION_ . the phenotype of t dna insertion cas knockout mutants and cdna mutant complemented plants revealed that cas is essential for stomatal closure induced by external . in contrast overexpression of cas promoted stomatal closure in the absence of externally applied . furthermore using the transgenic aequorin system we showed that ext induced cyt transients were significantly reduced in cas knockout mutants . our results suggest that _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized cas is essential for ext induced cyt transients and stomatal closure .
to understand the role of cas in stomatal movement we examined cas knockout and cas overexpressing phenotypes . firstly we isolated two cas t dna insertion mutant alleles and . homozygous individuals were identified by pcr analysis . sequencing the t dna flanking region showed that the insertions were localized bp and bp downstream from the _PROTEIN_ start codon . although both t dna insertions were located in introns northern and western blots showed that cas _PROTEIN_ was undetected in those lines . the progeny of cas and cas homozygous individuals grow normally under standard conditions . elevating external induces stomatal closure in several plants including commelina communis and arabidopsis . as shown in figure mm induced stomatal closure within h in wild type arabidopsis . on the other hand ext induced stomatal closure was completely impaired in cas and cas mutant alleles . this is consistent with a previous report that ext induced stomatal closure was inhibited in cas antisense transgenic plants . to confirm that the cas deficient phenotype is caused by a disruption of the cas gene we introduced cas cdna driven by a cauliflower mosaic virus promoter in cas mutants . _PROTEIN_ of cas mrna at wild type levels restored ext induced stomatal closure in cas mutant plants to the levels of wild type plants . moreover slight overexpression of cas partially promoted stomatal closure in cas mutants . thus we concluded that cas is essential for ext induced stomatal closure . on the other hand aba and dark induced stomatal closure and light induced stomatal opening was not suppressed in cas and cas mutant lines suggesting that the molecular machinery involved in stomatal movement was not impaired by cas inactivation . to further test the role of cas in stomatal movement we generated transgenic arabidopsis plants that overexpressed cas under the control of a camv promoter . a comparison of cas _PROTEIN_ in seedlings showed that casox and _PROTEIN_ the highest levels of cas . _PROTEIN_ of cas protein was times greater in casox plants compared with wild type plants . interestingly cas overexpression promoted stomatal closure in the absence of external . the stomatal opening was apparently dependent on cas _PROTEIN_ levels . on the other hand stomata in casox and leaves closed normally in response to external treatment . taken together these results demonstrate that cas is essential for ext induced stomatal closure in arabidopsis . in a previous paper citation reported that cas targets _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . however we recently found that cas had been identified in various proteomes of chloroplast _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . this prompted us to examine the subcellular localization of cas in detail . our results revealed that the n terminus of cas exhibits features typical of chloroplast transit peptides as indicated by several subcellular localization prediction _METHOD_ including targetp chlorop psort predotar and ipsort . to determine whether the cas protein is localized to chloroplasts we examined the intracellular localization of cas _METHOD_ fusion proteins . first n terminal amino acid residues containing the predicted transit peptide were fused to the _METHOD_ protein and _PROTEIN_ transiently in arabidopsis protoplasts . confocal microscopy revealed co localization of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ with chlorophyll _METHOD_ in chloroplasts suggesting that the n terminal sequence of cas acts as a chloroplast transit peptide . furthermore we observed that _METHOD_ tagged full length cas was predominantly localized to chloroplasts . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected in the central region of the chloroplasts but not in the stromules or periphery of the chloroplasts suggesting that cas _METHOD_ fusion is localized to inner _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . since _METHOD_ _METHOD_ did not disappear after disruption of protoplasts by osmotic shock cas is unlikely a stroma localized soluble protein . on the other hand _METHOD_ fused syntaxin _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was localized exclusively to _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . additionally the localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fusion proteins was apparently different from that of cas _METHOD_ fusions . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected _PROTEIN_ in the cytoplasm in control _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cells . to confirm the localization of cas _METHOD_ in chloroplasts we generated transgenic arabidopsis plants that constitutively _PROTEIN_ cas _METHOD_ under control of a camv promoter . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected exclusively in chloroplasts in all types of leaf cells including mesophyll epidermal and guard cells and in non photosynthetic _LOCATION_ in flower _PROTEIN_ and roots . on the other hand no _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of any cell . we next examined subcellular localization of cas protein by cell fractionation and western blotting . in crude protein extracts from wild type plants rabbit anti arabidopsis cas polyclonal antiserum detected a kda protein corresponding to the predicted size of the mature cas protein but slightly the kda cas precursor protein suggesting that the cas precursor is imported into chloroplasts and processed to mature protein . furthermore we isolated chloroplast _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and cytoplasmic microsomal containing fractions and analyzed them in western blots . the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker h _PROTEIN_ was detected in microsomal fraction but not in the chloroplast fraction . in contrast cas was detected exclusively in the chloroplast _LOCATION_ fraction as was an integral protein of the chloroplast _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . cas signal was not detected in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fraction . to further determine the localization of cas in chloroplasts we isolated intact chloroplasts from spinach and fractionated them into soluble envelope and _LOCATION_ fractions . each fraction was obtained with little cross contamination as determined by western analysis of specific marker proteins . we used _PROTEIN_ and as the stromal outer envelope and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ markers respectively . cas was exclusively detected in the _LOCATION_ fraction but not in the envelope and stroma fractions . furthermore cas was also detected in the chloroplast _LOCATION_ fraction from arabidopsis . the results clearly demonstrated that cas is localized _PROTEIN_ to chloroplast _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and is not associated with _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to further describe the topology of cas protein in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ isolated _LOCATION_ were treated with thermolysin or trypsin . this treatment is expected to digest proteins exposed to the stromal side of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the protease treated _LOCATION_ were analyzed by western blot using n terminal specific anti cas antibody . cas was degraded by proteases in a concentration dependent manner suggesting that the cas n terminus is exposed to the stromal side of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in contrast the _LOCATION_ lumen peripheral protein psbp was not affected by protease treatments indicating that _LOCATION_ remained sealed and retained their correct sidedness . it has been shown that _METHOD_ _METHOD_ could not be detected in the photosynthetically active _LOCATION_ lumen due to its acidic ph suggesting that _METHOD_ fused to the c terminus of cas may also be exposed to the stromal side . however we could not determine the location of the cas c terminus immunologically since our c terminal specific antibody could not detect cas proteins in plants . furthermore we treated _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ with high salt alkaline denaturing or non ionic detergent solutions . psbp was released from the _LOCATION_ after treatment with nacl and but _LOCATION_ associated cas resisted high salt alkaline and denaturing treatment suggesting that cas is an integral _LOCATION_ protein . we were interested in knowing how chloroplasts regulate ext induced stomatal closure . it has been shown that ext induced stomatal closure is usually preceded by a transient elevation in cyt . to examine the involvement of chloroplast localized cas in the generation of ext induced cyt transients we generated several wild type or cas mutant plants that _PROTEIN_ the apoaequorin gene under the control of the camv promoter . wild type and cas mutants that _PROTEIN_ the same amount of apoaequorin protein were selected for further evaluation . as shown in figure mm induced transient cyt elevation within min after which the signal gradually declined . the initial cyt elevation was significantly reduced in cas mutant plants . the integrated amount of ext induced cyt elevation over sec in wild type plants was greatly reduced in cas mutant plants . these results together with the previous finding that ext induced high frequency cyt oscillations were not detected in guard cells in cas antisense plants led us to conclude that chloroplast localized cas is involved in the generation of ext induced cyt elevation in arabidopsis . we examined cas protein levels during plant development and senescence with western blot . cas protein was detected in rosette leaves cauline leaves _METHOD_ and flowers but not in roots suggesting that cas is upregulated with chloroplast development . to determine whether tissue specific and developmental _PROTEIN_ of cas protein is controlled at the level of transcription we histochemically examined the localization of cas promoter driven beta _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in transgenic arabidopsis . in week old plants gus was detected in rosette leaves and sepals but not in roots . the results suggest that tissue specific cas protein accumulation is regulated at the level of transcription . on the other hand high levels of gus and low levels of cas were detected in week old cotyledons suggesting that post transcriptional regulation has a role in cas gene _PROTEIN_ in cotyledons . furthermore we found that cas declined to very low levels in rosette and cauline leaves in week old plants . the _PROTEIN_ in cas coincided with the disappearance of _PROTEIN_ which is known to be quickly degraded during senescence . thus cas like _PROTEIN_ is downregulated quickly and specifically during leaf senescence . finally to examine cell specific cas promoter activity we analyzed transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ cas promoter _METHOD_ gene fusion . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected in the palisade mesophyll epidermal and guard cells in leaves . it is likely that cas is _PROTEIN_ in all types of leaf cells and may also have a role in chloroplast function in mesophyll and epidermal cells . since cas is localized to chloroplast _LOCATION_ we examined the effects of cas gene disruption and overexpression on chlorophyll and photosystem ii activity . we found that suppression and overexpression of cas protein did not result in significant _PROTEIN_ or increases in chlorophyll or the chlorophyll a/b ratio . thus it is unlikely that cas is directly involved in photosynthesis activity . however it should be noted that non photochemical quenching values were slightly but significantly increased and _PROTEIN_ in the cas knockout and overexpressing mutants respectively . chl a b chlorophyll a and b contents in plant leaves chl a/b chlorophyll a/b ratio fv/fm maximum quantum yield of psii effective quantum yield of psii npq non photochemical quenching fraction of qa present in the reduced state . data are mean values _PROTEIN_ of six separate experiments .
