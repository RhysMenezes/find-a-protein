in plants myoinositol signaling pathways have been associated with several stress developmental and physiological processes but the regulation of these pathways is largely unknown . in our efforts to better understand myoinositol signaling pathways in plants we have found that the repeat region of a myoinositol polyphosphate phosphatase _PROTEIN_ interacts with the sucrose nonfermenting related kinase _PROTEIN_ in the yeast two hybrid system and in vitro . plant proteins _PROTEIN_ have been described as central integrators of sugar metabolic stress and developmental signals . using mutants defective in _PROTEIN_ we show that _PROTEIN_ can act as a regulator of activity and that regulation differs with different nutrient availability . specifically we show that under low nutrient or sugar conditions _PROTEIN_ acts as a positive regulator of activity . in contrast under severe starvation conditions _PROTEIN_ acts as a negative regulator of activity . to delineate the regulatory interaction that occurs between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we used a cell free degradation assay and found that _PROTEIN_ is required to reduce the amount of _PROTEIN_ targeted for proteasomal destruction under low nutrient conditions . this regulation most likely involves a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction within the _LOCATION_ as a _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein was localized to the _LOCATION_ . we also show that a loss of function in _PROTEIN_ leads to nutrient level dependent reduction of root growth along with abscisic acid and sugar insensitivity . _PROTEIN_ mutants accumulate less inositol trisphosphate in response to sugar stress and have alterations in aba regulated gene _PROTEIN_ both of which are consistent with the known role of inositol trisphosphate in aba mediated signaling . we propose that by forming a protein complex with _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ plays a regulatory role linking inositol sugar and stress signaling .
besides containing a conserved inositol polyphosphate phosphatase catalytic domain _PROTEIN_ also contains five repeat regions in the n terminus that may allow for unique protein interactions . three other genes in the arabidopsis genome _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ encode similar proteins and the amino acid identity of the repeat region varies from to among these proteins . we used the amino acid sequences corresponding to these repeat regions in blastp searches and obtained related sequences with e values less than . clustalw and _PROTEIN_ were used to generate phylogenetic trees using parsimony which showed that the repeat regions are contained on a separate branch thus indicating that they are more similar to one another than to other repeat regions . the similarity of the suggests that these proteins may function in a redundant manner . microarray data from genevestigator indicates that _PROTEIN_ is broadly and abundantly _PROTEIN_ compared with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . we conclude that the containing are a small group of proteins with the potential to form protein complexes and that functional redundancy may be present . to investigate the ability of the regions of _PROTEIN_ to participate in protein complexes we used the yeast two hybrid system . the n terminal amino acids from _PROTEIN_ containing the repeats were used as bait in a yeast two hybrid screen of an arabidopsis d old etiolated seedling cdna library . we screened over million yeast transformants and obtained a positive clone containing the c terminal domain of the _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ . we retransformed this positive clone into yeast and verified the interaction . negative controls including the empty dna binding domain and activation domain vectors established that _PROTEIN_ binds to the repeat region of the _PROTEIN_ protein in yeast . to examine the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in vitro we fused the sequence encoding the xpress epitope tag to the c terminus of the repeat region of _PROTEIN_ and the epitope tag sequence to the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ both proteins in escherichia coli . the construct directs the _PROTEIN_ of a kd protein detected by an anti monoclonal antibody and in most cases we detected two bands perhaps as a result of phosphorylation or proteolytic cleavage . the construct directs the _PROTEIN_ of a kd protein detected by an anti xpress monoclonal antibody . these interactions are specific as is not detected by the anti xpress antibody and is not detected by the anti antibody . to determine whether the _PROTEIN_ recombinant protein can pull down immunoprecipitations using anti protein a sepharose beads were performed and the resulting complex was then analyzed by western blotting with an anti xpress antibody . as shown in figure the repeat region from _PROTEIN_ is only detected in this pull down assay when it has been incubated in the presence of . we conclude that the repeat region from _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ can form a protein complex in vitro . _PROTEIN_ along with its closely related gene family member _PROTEIN_ encodes a suc nonfermenting related kinase implicated as a central integrator of energy signaling and metabolic regulation in yeast plants and animals . the interaction of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is novel and is perhaps unique to plants in that yeast and animal do not contain regions . this interaction may indicate that signal termination via _PROTEIN_ function affects the energy sensor in plants . data obtained from the genevestigator database indicate that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are detected in most plant tissues examined although _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels are very low compared with gene _PROTEIN_ . to further explore the link between signaling and the energy sensor _PROTEIN_ we isolated two independent t dna insertion mutants in the _PROTEIN_ gene . two potential mutants were identified in the salk t dna database and named _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and were compared with their corresponding wild type accessions . the presence of the t dna insertion was verified by diagnostic pcr in each mutant using genomic dna and primers specific for the t dna left border and gene specific primers that flank the t dna insertion . the resulting lb gene specific fragments were sequenced indicating that in _PROTEIN_ mutants a second t dna insertion is found in tandem in the fourth exon . this is in contrast to the previously reported analysis by citation showing that the _PROTEIN_ mutant contains a single t dna insertion . using primers specific for the end of _PROTEIN_ we detected a pcr product in both wild type lines used but not in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ . using primers that amplify the end we detected a kb product in both wild type lines and in the _PROTEIN_ mutant but not in _PROTEIN_ . we conclude that the _PROTEIN_ mutant is totally lacking _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant lines do not _PROTEIN_ transcripts capable of encoding a full length _PROTEIN_ protein . to examine how the loss of _PROTEIN_ affects the _PROTEIN_ of its binding partner _PROTEIN_ we examined the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and its closely related isoform _PROTEIN_ in d old dark grown _PROTEIN_ and wild type seedlings . the results reveal that there are no large changes in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mutants . as shown in figure we found that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ remains unchanged in _PROTEIN_ mutants and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is barely detectable but also unchanged . in contrast the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is increased in both _PROTEIN_ mutant lines revealing a possible means of compensation for the loss of _PROTEIN_ function . under standard laboratory conditions _PROTEIN_ mutants did not exhibit any abnormalities in plant growth or development . since citation previously reported that _PROTEIN_ mutants are altered in cotyledon vein development we carefully examined both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants and their corresponding wild type accessions for cotyledon vein development as described by citation . using d old light grown seedlings of wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant soil grown plants we found no evidence for a cotyledon vein phenotype . our analysis revealed that of total cotyledons and of total _PROTEIN_ cotyledons have abnormal patterns and that only of total cotyledons and of total _PROTEIN_ cotyledons can be classified as abnormal . thus there is variation in cotyledon vein development within different wild type accessions but not between _PROTEIN_ mutants and their matched wild type accessions . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ affects function we measured the activity of in _PROTEIN_ mutants and wild type seedlings grown under various nutrient conditions . it is well documented that regulates multiple transcription cascades in response to sugar or energy deprivation however whether in planta activity changes under various nutrient conditions is not known . to address this we measured activity from d old wild type seedlings grown under low light with different added nutrients to establish various low energy conditions no nutrients low nutrients _METHOD_ and optimal nutrients _METHOD_ . in addition we examined a stressful level of added sugar _METHOD_ . for this work we used a well established assay and incubated a sucrose phosphate synthase substrate peptide radiolabeled _PROTEIN_ and of plant protein extract for min . validation that these conditions are in the linear range of product accumulation is shown in supplemental figure . as expected from its role as a low energy sensor activity is higher in seedlings grown on low nutrients compared with extracts prepared from seedlings grown on optimal nutrients or glc . figure shows that the activity of significantly increases in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants when seedlings are grown with no nutrients . in contrast activity _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings compared with wild type seedlings when grown with low nutrients . furthermore the decline in activity is even more dramatic when glc is added . we conclude that a loss of _PROTEIN_ function affects activity and the impact differs depending on nutrient availability . our data support a role for _PROTEIN_ as a negative regulator of activity in the absence of nutrients and as a positive regulator when either low nutrients or glc is present . to explore whether _PROTEIN_ regulates _PROTEIN_ stability we used a similar approach as citation to examine the stability of recombinant tagged _PROTEIN_ in a cell free degradation assay with wild type or _PROTEIN_ extracts . the time course of degradation with wild type seedling extracts indicated that is mostly degraded within min . a proteasome specific inhibitor blocked degradation in both _PROTEIN_ and wild type extracts indicating that is destroyed by the proteasome pathway in these assays . to test the hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ destabilizes _PROTEIN_ under the no nutrient conditions we examined a min time point for analysis as a midpoint to total degradation . the data indicate no difference in stability in wild type and _PROTEIN_ extracts under the no nutrient conditions . in contrast when extracts are prepared from seedlings grown on low nutrients we find less accumulation in _PROTEIN_ extracts compared with wild type extracts . we conclude that under the low nutrient conditions _PROTEIN_ is required to stabilize protein and slow its degradation by the proteasome pathway . furthermore the increased degradation of seen with the low nutrient conditions correlates well with the lower activity levels measured in _PROTEIN_ mutants under these same nutrient conditions . in contrast _PROTEIN_ is not required to stabilize when seedlings are grown with no nutrients and this is consistent with the switch in activity levels we found in _PROTEIN_ mutants grown with no nutrients . however since we did not observe an increase in stability in _PROTEIN_ extracts prepared from the no nutrient conditions we speculate that there is an additional mechanism that influences the elevated activity in _PROTEIN_ mutants under these conditions . we compared _PROTEIN_ mutants with _PROTEIN_ mutants which have a small reduction in root growth under the low nutrient conditions and exhibit enhanced root growth with to suc . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants exhibited reduced root growth under no nutrient and low nutrient conditions and no change in root growth when exogenously supplied with suc . a similar trend in nutrient dependent root growth reduction of _PROTEIN_ mutants was also found when seedlings were grown in the dark . this indicates that along with a _PROTEIN_ in activity _PROTEIN_ mutants grown on the low nutrient conditions have the same root phenotype as the _PROTEIN_ mutants suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ in root growth may be an outcome of _PROTEIN_ activity . however since the _PROTEIN_ mutants grown with no nutrients have elevated activity we conclude that under these conditions the _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mutant root growth can not be a function of lower activity and most likely involves another mechanism . to test whether _PROTEIN_ is required for sugar and aba responses we analyzed age matched seeds for germination in the presence of or glc or or suc . at low concentrations of sugar there were no differences in the germination of wild type and _PROTEIN_ seeds in the dark or light . however at a high exogenous sugar concentration in the dark we found that _PROTEIN_ mutants were significantly less sensitive to sugar . we saw the same trend in sugar insensitivity when _PROTEIN_ mutant seeds were germinated in the presence of glc in the light although the sugar insensitivity was less apparent . this sugar insensitivity was also noted for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant seeds germinated in the presence of suc in which maximal increases of and fold for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively were noted compared with wild type seeds . germination in the presence of mannitol a nonmetabolizable sugar was not altered indicating that the sugar insensitivity of _PROTEIN_ mutants is not due to a general osmotic stress tolerance . we also germinated _PROTEIN_ mutant seeds in the presence of and aba and measured the impact on germination during a d period . as expected germination of wild type seeds was delayed by aba in a concentration dependent manner during the d period under light conditions . in contrast _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant seeds were aba insensitive reaching germination on day in the presence of aba and to on day in the presence of aba . since we did not find reduced seed dormancy in our mutants this aba insensitivity of _PROTEIN_ mutants most likely does not correlate with changes in de novo synthesis of aba and is in accordance with the previously reported results for aba insensitivity of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . to determine whether there are differences in the _PROTEIN_ patterns of glc and/or aba regulated genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mutants we examined _PROTEIN_ in d old dark grown wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings exposed to glc for d . treatment with glc strongly induced the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in wild type seedlings . in contrast _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants grown in glc contained much smaller increases in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcript levels indicating that induction of these genes is diminished but not abolished in _PROTEIN_ mutants . the regulation of _PROTEIN_ on the other hand was not significantly altered in _PROTEIN_ mutants . to ensure that the alterations noted in _PROTEIN_ mutants are due to loss of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ we _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter in wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . we examined two lines of _METHOD_ plants with good _PROTEIN_ of the transgene along with wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants in aba sensitivity assays . both _METHOD_ lines exhibited more aba sensitivity in germination assays compared with _PROTEIN_ mutants . since _PROTEIN_ mutants contain _PROTEIN_ activity under low nutrient conditions compared with wild type plants we also measured activity in the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ lines and found as expected similar or increased activity compared with wild type plants _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . we conclude that _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene complements the _PROTEIN_ mutant . we examined whether the glc insensitivity of _PROTEIN_ mutants is accompanied by alterations in _METHOD_ levels by measuring _METHOD_ levels . the results in figure indicate that neither _PROTEIN_ nor _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings differ significantly from wild type seedlings in their _METHOD_ levels under control conditions . when wild type seedlings are exposed to glc for d _METHOD_ levels increase to fold which is a statistically significant elevation . however when _PROTEIN_ mutants are grown for d in the presence of glc _METHOD_ level changes are smaller with an increase of to fold over basal levels and statistically significant only in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . more importantly the glc stimulated levels in both _PROTEIN_ mutants differ significantly from the glc stimulated levels in wild type seedlings . we conclude that _PROTEIN_ mutants are impaired in their ability to accumulate in response to glc and that this correlates with the sugar and aba insensitivity noted in the germination assays . to investigate the subcellular location of the _PROTEIN_ protein we performed imaging experiments with _PROTEIN_ mutants complemented with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct _METHOD_ and wild type plants containing the same _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct . as the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct we used allowed for complementation of the aba and sugar insensitivity phenotype in _PROTEIN_ mutants it is likely that this fusion protein undergoes the same posttranslational modifications and subcellular localization as the native _PROTEIN_ protein . we analyzed progeny from two independent _METHOD_ lines with _METHOD_ deconvolution microscopy and found a similar pattern in both lines . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was associated with the _LOCATION_ in many but not all cells in cotyledon epidermis hypocotyls and roots . _LOCATION_ from some but not all guard cells contained the _METHOD_ protein . to confirm the _LOCATION_ localization we stained _METHOD_ seedlings with the _LOCATION_ dye diamidino phenylindole and imaged _METHOD_ and dapi _METHOD_ simultaneously . once again we found _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in only a portion of root _LOCATION_ while dapi _METHOD_ was present in all _LOCATION_ . we conclude that _PROTEIN_ protein is located in the _LOCATION_ of seedlings and that its presence in the _LOCATION_ is restricted in some cells .
