more than distinct amino acid transporter genes have been identified in the genome of arabidopsis indicating that transport of amino acids across _LOCATION_ is a highly complex feature in plants . based on sequence similarity these transporters can be divided into two major superfamilies the amino acid transporter family and the amino acid polyamine choline transporter family . currently _PROTEIN_ transporters of the amino acid transporter family have been characterized . here a molecular and functional characterization of amino acid polyamine choline transporters is presented namely the cationic amino acid transporter subfamily . _PROTEIN_ functions as a high affinity basic amino acid transporter at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . uptake of toxic amino acid analogs implies that neutral or acidic amino acids are preferentially transported by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ profiles suggest that _PROTEIN_ may function in reuptake of leaking amino acids at the leaf margin while _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in young and rapidly dividing tissues such as young leaves and root apical meristem . _PROTEIN_ is localized to the tonoplast in transformed arabidopsis protoplasts and thus may encode the long sought _LOCATION_ amino acid transporter .
the locus code and nomenclatures for all cat family members in arabidopsis are given in materials and methods. the first member of this family _PROTEIN_ has been characterized at the functional level . _PROTEIN_ is the closest homolog of _PROTEIN_ and is identical to _PROTEIN_ on the protein level . _PROTEIN_ shows slightly lower identity to _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are only identical at the protein level . using tm prediction _METHOD_ the proteins of this family are likely to have tm domains with both termini on the _LOCATION_ side . the sequences can be phylogenetically grouped into small subgroups . genes from different subbranches differ markedly in their exon intron structure _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the intron sizes and location of splice sites however are roughly conserved in genes in each subbranch . several cat proteins contain putative transit peptides for targeting to _LOCATION_ . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are predicted to contain chloroplast transit peptides _PROTEIN_ contains putative mitochondrial targeting signals while _PROTEIN_ is predicted to be targeted to chloroplast or mitochondria . _PROTEIN_ of each cat member is documented by numerous _PROTEIN_ sequence tags in public databases . the only exception is _PROTEIN_ for which no est or cdna could be identified . public microarray data _LOCATION_ document _PROTEIN_ in many tissues for most of the cats . according to the est abundance _PROTEIN_ is the highest _PROTEIN_ at the transcriptional level . the tissue specificity of _PROTEIN_ was determined by rna gel blots . _PROTEIN_ mrna was similarly _PROTEIN_ in root stem flower sink leaf source leaf and silique . the same _PROTEIN_ profile was obtained using reverse transcription pcr . using as control _PROTEIN_ of all cat members was identified by rt pcr in roots _METHOD_ flowers and leaves except for _PROTEIN_ . thus most cat members are broadly _PROTEIN_ and more detailed analysis is necessary to assign a cellular function to these genes . yeast has provided a genuine heterologous _PROTEIN_ system for many plant nutrient and metabolite transporters . the yeast mutant which lacks eight endogenous amino acid transport _METHOD_ was transformed with plasmids containing cdnas of several cat family transporters . yeast transformed with empty plasmid was used as control . the yeast mutant is unable to efficiently utilize arg asp citrulline aminobutyric acid glu or pro as sole nitrogen sources . as expected from competition studies of his uptake _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in enhanced arg citrulline and glu import and supported growth on these substances as sole nitrogen sources . _PROTEIN_ behaved very similarly and complemented growth on arg citrulline and to a lesser extent glu . cells transformed with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ showed no clear enhanced growth on media containing mm arg as sole nitrogen source . similar results were obtained on mm citrulline and glu . within d none of the cat members mediated sufficient amino acid transport to enable growth on mm asp pro or aminobutyric acid . growth of a lys auxotroph was restored by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ but not by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . the inability of several cats to support growth on arg asp pro aminobutyric acid or lys might be due to poor targeting to the yeast _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ lost functionality or a different substrate spectrum than _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . as shown below it is likely that an altered substrate spectrum is responsible for the poor support of yeast growth . direct l arg uptake was determined in carrying pdr _PROTEIN_ and the same strain transformed with the empty plasmid . uptake was linear over min and was inhibited by the protonophore _PROTEIN_ cyanide chlorophenylhydrazone . arg influx was ph dependent with a bell shaped optimum at ph similar to other proton coupled amino acid _METHOD_ . uptake was saturated at low arg concentrations with a . glu was also taken up but with a much lower affinity . arg transport was significantly inhibited only by basic amino acids when supplied at fold excess . interestingly some uncharged amino acids and even allantoin were also weak competitors . this may not necessarily indicate direct competition for the same binding site but may be partially explained by unspecific lowering of the driving force for arg . allantoin and some amino acids are imported into the used yeast strain by h cotransport _METHOD_ . the imported protons depolarize the yeast cells and reduce the driving force for the positively charged arg and a possibly cotransported h . in summary the selectivity of _PROTEIN_ is thus similar to that of _PROTEIN_ both encoding high affinity cats . as the activities of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were not successfully detected in yeast and to study the transport mechanism of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in more detail several cat transporters were _PROTEIN_ in xenopus oocytes . two unrelated amino acid transporters _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ that had been functionally _PROTEIN_ earlier in oocytes served as controls and were measured in parallel . while the aaps generated large amino acid dependent currents no currents were observed with cats . this was somewhat surprising as the experiments in the yeast system identified _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as transporters for positively charged amino acids suggesting that these substrates should generate substrate induced currents . direct l lys uptake measurements with oocytes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ confirmed that only _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ was functional at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of oocytes . the yeast strain does not transport arg asp citrulline aminobutyric acid glu or pro while other amino acids are transported efficiently . to test if other amino acids may be preferred or if cats may be functional in detoxification of unwanted toxic amino acid analogs a growth test on toxic amino acids was established . yeast growth is sensitive to low concentrations of the glu analog l met sulfoximine _METHOD_ an inhibitor of gln synthetase . yeast strains with increased amino acid import activity are more sensitive to _METHOD_ . similarly the sensitivity to toxic amino diazo oxo l norleucine an analog of the neutral amino acid gln is expected to increase with higher uptake activity . don inhibits gln requiring enzymes such as _PROTEIN_ phosphate synthase . the toxicity of the arg analog canavanine has been used to identify basic amino acid transporters in yeast . sensitivity to toxic amino acids was found to be higher in the wild type strain . endogenous amino acid uptake is known to be strongly suppressed by high ammonium in wild type yeast largely due to suppression and lower uptake by general amino acid permease . due to the higher sensitivity the wild type strain was used in the following experiments but highly similar results were also obtained from similar experiments conducted with the strain . the _PROTEIN_ of functional amino acid transporters _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ increased the sensitivity of the mutant strain to canavanine the toxic arg analog when supplemented to the medium containing mm ammonium . thus both transporters which mediated efficient transport of arg also transported its toxic analog making yeast cells be more sensitive to this toxic drug . _PROTEIN_ of the other family members did not lead to increased sensitivity to canavanine in accordance with the _PROTEIN_ that they did not transport arg in yeast growth assays . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ both increased the sensitivity to _METHOD_ and don which fits their ability to transport glu and the _PROTEIN_ that gln weakly competes for arg in uptake experiments . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ also conferred higher sensitivity to toxic _METHOD_ and don indicating that they mediate at least some uptake of these toxic amino acids . it should be noted that some transporters did confer sensitivity to the glu analog _METHOD_ although growth on glu was not observed . however the ability to grow on a single amino acid as sole nitrogen source requires high capacity uptake of that specific amino acid since all other amino acids and nucleotides need to be synthesized from that amino acid . in contrast only low import of a toxic amino acid analog may be sufficient to confer toxicity . the inability of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to mediate efficient uptake of basic amino acids but their transport of neutral and acidic amino acid analogs may suggest that the substrate spectrum of these transporters is different from that of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in all experimental conditions _PROTEIN_ transformed yeast were indistinguishable from vector transformed controls . the _PROTEIN_ pattern of the high affinity/basic amino acid transporter _PROTEIN_ was analyzed by promoter activity analysis . as the neighboring gene is located only kb upstream of the _PROTEIN_ open reading frame arabidopsis plants containing this fragment as promoter _PROTEIN_ fusion were generated . when the transgenic arabidopsis lines were examined with short histochemical staining periods _PROTEIN_ promoter activity was visible only at the leaf rim but intensive staining of cotyledons of developing seedlings was detected after long incubation in staining solution . promoter activity was identical in more than lines and was not detected by short staining periods in older plants with the exception of some staining in flowers which explains the low abundance of transcript in roots using rt pcr . staining was also observed in seeds . the _PROTEIN_ pattern was compared to predictions of cis acting regulatory elements using the place database . a tgacgt motif that strongly drives amylase _PROTEIN_ during seedling development is identified before the start _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ promoter in accordance with _PROTEIN_ during early seedling development . the _PROTEIN_ pattern of the closest relative of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was also analyzed . gus histochemical analysis was performed on transgenic arabidopsis plants stably _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ promoter gus fusion in which the kb genomic sequence located upstream from the _PROTEIN_ was driving gus _PROTEIN_ . analysis of the _PROTEIN_ promoter gus plants identified _PROTEIN_ in rapidly dividing cells of the shoot and root apical meristem and in young leaves and petioles during seedling development . at _PROTEIN_ developmental stages staining was visible in flowers as well . in root tips _PROTEIN_ was absent from the columella and epidermis . consistent with the _PROTEIN_ pattern an acttta motif for apical meristem _PROTEIN_ is identified at position . _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ in transiently transformed arabidopsis protoplasts was restricted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ also localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but more than one half of the protoplasts showed additional _METHOD_ _METHOD_ on intracellular _LOCATION_ . a possible explanation for the lack of function of _PROTEIN_ in heterologous _METHOD_ is that the transporter might not be localized at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but at intracellular _LOCATION_ . to evaluate such a possibility _PROTEIN_ was also fused with _METHOD_ at the _PROTEIN_ terminus and transiently _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts . confocal images from _METHOD_ proteins showed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized to the tonoplast implying a function in amino acid storage or export from the _LOCATION_ . in a few _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cells a punctuate _METHOD_ was additionally observed and only some _LOCATION_ were _METHOD_ . as control _METHOD_ was also _PROTEIN_ alone .
