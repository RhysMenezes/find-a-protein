the two highly similar arabidopsis apyrases _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were previously shown to be involved in plant growth and development evidently by regulating _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ signals . the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ was investigated to corroborate an _LOCATION_ function . transgenic arabidopsis lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fused to the snap tag were used for indirect _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ was detected in punctate structures within the cell . the same signal pattern was found in seedlings stably overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ by indirect _METHOD_ and live imaging . in order to identify the nature of the _PROTEIN_ positive structures _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings were treated with the endocytic marker stain pyridinium dibromide and crossed with a transgenic line _PROTEIN_ the trans _LOCATION_ marker rab . neither nor rab co localized with _PROTEIN_ . however live imaging of transgenic arabidopsis lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and either the _METHOD_ protein tagged _LOCATION_ marker membrin syntaxin of plants or _LOCATION_ transport protein homolog showed co localization . the _LOCATION_ localization was confirmed by immunogold labeling of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . there was no indication of _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ by indirect _METHOD_ using antibodies against snap and _METHOD_ live imaging of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and immunogold labeling of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . activity assays with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ revealed gdp udp and idp as substrates but neither _PROTEIN_ nor adp . to determine if _PROTEIN_ is a soluble or _LOCATION_ protein microsomal _LOCATION_ were isolated and treated with various solubilizing agents . only _PROTEIN_ and urea were able to release the _PROTEIN_ protein from microsomal _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ is an integral _LOCATION_ protein with the substrate specificity typical for _LOCATION_ apyrases . it is therefore not likely to regulate _LOCATION_ nucleotide signals as previously thought . we propose instead that _PROTEIN_ exerts its growth and developmental effects by possibly regulating glycosylation reactions in the _LOCATION_ .
one objective was to localize _PROTEIN_ at the subcellular level to learn how the protein exerts its function in plant growth . tagging _PROTEIN_ was chosen over raising antibodies against it because _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are so identical in their amino acid sequence there is only one six aa stretch in _PROTEIN_ that has four different and two similar aa to the corresponding sequence in _PROTEIN_ . all other stretches of differences between the two sequences comprise only one or two aa . among the tags available the snap tag seemed the most suitable . as an alkylguanine dna alkyltransferase snap binds covalently to benzylguanine based substrates . there are a large number of substrates coupled to different _METHOD_ dyes and other labels commercially available making the snap tag a versatile tool for localization studies . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ snap was placed under the control of the native promoter region because overexpression can lead to localization artifacts . despite this risk another tagged _PROTEIN_ version _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was fused to the strong cauliflower mosaic virus promoter because _PROTEIN_ levels of ntpdases are generally low . the snap or _METHOD_ tag was fused to the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ to avoid losing the tag by a possible n terminal cleavage in a subcellular targeting process . since tags can impair protein function and lead to mislocalization a complementation strategy was performed . the knockout of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is seedling lethal _PROTEIN_ . a dko seedling should survive if it is complemented with a tagged _PROTEIN_ that is functional and correctly localized . however the use of the promoter made the rescue of the dko mutant with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ impossible as confirmed experimentally because this promoter is turned off in pollen . without _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the dko pollen no progeny will form because the presence of either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ is prerequisite for pollen to germinate _PROTEIN_ . in order to overcome this hurdle partially complemented apyrase _PROTEIN_ sko plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were used as the genetic background for transformation with each tagged _PROTEIN_ construct . these plants carried _PROTEIN_ under the control of the pollen specific promoter _PROTEIN_ which ensured the survival of the dko pollen . dna was isolated from progeny of the partially complemented sko plants containing either _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ snap or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and used for genotyping by pcr . several dko plants without a wt _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ gene but with a tagged apyrase construct were identified hereafter called dko snap and dko _METHOD_ respectively . the pcr analysis of two such mutants is shown in figure a . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ construct was always present in the dko _METHOD_ mutants as expected but interestingly also in the dko snap mutants . one possible explanation is that some regulatory elements necessary for optimal _PROTEIN_ in pollen were missing in the chosen promoter region . the promoter region used previously for _PROTEIN_ gus analyses _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was kb longer at the end including almost the entire gene upstream of _PROTEIN_ . since the gene was deemed unnecessary for successful complementation it was mostly excluded in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ snap construct . identification of apyrase double knockouts complemented with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ snap or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . genomic dna was isolated from dko plants complemented with either _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ snap or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and subjected to pcr analysis . the pcr products for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the t dna null mutations _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ snap _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis . genomic dna from plants which had been tested positive for the respective amplification products before served as the positive controls . the negative pcr controls were run without addition of any dna template . the phenotype of the wt the dko and the dko rescued with either the snap or _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ are shown . the genetic backgrounds are represented by colored symbols . images of d d d d old _METHOD_ seedlings and of d old adult plants were taken . scale bars equal cm . to confirm that the snap and _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ could rescue the lethal dko seedling phenotype the seedling phenotype of complemented sko and dko plants in comparison with the wt and dko seedlings was analyzed . sko snap _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and sko _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants were included in the study to check for possible dominant negative effects of the tagged apyrase on the wt phenotype . dko seedlings without a construct coding for a tagged _PROTEIN_ had an abnormal phenotype with fleshy cotyledons and no root _PROTEIN_ . these seedlings did not develop beyond this stage . dko plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ snap or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ on the other hand showed no phenotypical differences to wt plants and sko mutants . the lethal dko _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ could be rescued by transformation with _PROTEIN_ snap or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ making the dko snap and dko _METHOD_ plants suitable tools for localization studies . for localization of _PROTEIN_ at the subcellular level by confocal microscopy living dko snap seedlings were incubated with snap compatible _METHOD_ substrates to label the _PROTEIN_ snap fusion protein . two cell permeable _METHOD_ substrates were used red _METHOD_ tetramethylrhodamine star and the green _METHOD_ bg . although specific labeling of fusion proteins in vivo was successful in yeast and animal as well as human cell cultures a high background made the detection of _PROTEIN_ snap specific signals in arabidopsis seedlings impossible . the tested dyes passed the cell wall and entered the cell but even h washing steps could not remove the excess _METHOD_ substrate . therefore indirect _METHOD_ was chosen as a different approach . dko snap seedlings were fixed . after cell wall digestion and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ permeabilization they were incubated with primary antibodies against the snap tag . following several washing steps fitc labeled secondary antibodies were added to visualize _PROTEIN_ snap for the _PROTEIN_ . the background was low but no specific signals could be detected . to increase the _METHOD_ signal the tyramide signal amplification _PROTEIN_ technique was applied . this technique employs peroxidase activity to covalently couple a large number of labeled substrates in the immediate vicinity . therefore instead of fitc labeled secondary antibodies hrp labeled antibodies were added in combination with fitc coupled tyramides . _PROTEIN_ improved the signal to noise ratio and intracellular dot like structures became visible in dko snap seedlings which were not found in the wt . root hairs were selected as suitable cell types for localization because promoter _PROTEIN_ analyses suggested that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ strongly in root hairs as well as in guard cells among other cell types _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is present in intracellular dot like structures but absent from the _LOCATION_ space . _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ microscopy images of various cell types are depicted . all wt control images were captured using the identical _PROTEIN_ settings as for the corresponding images of the transgenic plants . the fitc alexa fluor and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ is shown in green the chlorophyll _METHOD_ in magenta . the _METHOD_ signals are overlaid with a bright field image in a b e and f. scale bars . root hairs of dko snap and wt seedlings were fixed and successively incubated with snap antibodies and secondary rabbit igg coupled with horseradish peroxidase . fitc tyramides were added to amplify the _METHOD_ signal . the parameters of the indirect _METHOD_ detection were modified in multiple independent experiments until fitc specific _METHOD_ signals as shown here were obtained . two hundred nm tokuyasu cryo sections through root tips of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings were fixed and incubated with or without _METHOD_ antibodies . all samples were incubated with secondary rabbit fab fragments coupled with alexa fluor . the pictures and were taken with the same exposure times . two guard cells of a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic and wt seedling are depicted . the dot like green _METHOD_ signals were obtained in at least independent live imagings . a protoplast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and a wt protoplast both prepared from cotyledons were imaged . overlays of the green and magenta _METHOD_ signals are shown . these images represent the results from three independent protoplastations . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and the bright field image of the same epidermal section of a cotyledon from an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overexpressing seedling grown under alkaline conditions are shown representative of the imaging results from three seedlings . doughnut or horseshoe shaped _METHOD_ structures typical of _LOCATION_ stacks imaged from the top are indicated by white arrows . to overcome the weak _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ the indirect _METHOD_ approach was repeated with transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the control of the strong promoter . we used primary antibodies against _METHOD_ and secondary alexa fluor coupled antibodies in two different approaches . post embedding labeling of nm thin tokuyasu cryo sections and . pre embedding labeling followed by embedding in technovit resin and sectioning . in both experiments the intracellular punctate signals could be confirmed in the root and in root hairs . no signals were detected in the cell wall and at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and in the control without primary antibody . to verify the imaging data obtained by _METHOD_ a second detection method was used . the transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were imaged in vivo by _PROTEIN_ . here the same intracellular punctate pattern as found before in _PROTEIN_ snap and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants was observed in guard cells cotyledon epidermis hypocotyls and roots . the wt control did not present this punctate pattern as shown exemplarily for wt guard cells . _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ tag alone led to cytoplasmic staining _PROTEIN_ . the method of live imaging of _METHOD_ tagged proteins is suitable to detect apyrase in the cell wall as shown for apoplastic apyrases in other plant species _PROTEIN_ . but since _PROTEIN_ was expected to be localized _LOCATION_ and since _METHOD_ does not fluoresce at ph a weak _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal could be missed if the tag were exposed to the acidic environment of the cell wall . to provide an optimal ph for _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ environment wt protoplasts and those _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were prepared from cotyledons and imaged at ph . as before intracellular _METHOD_ signals were found which did not appear in the wt control but the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of the transgenic protoplasts did not fluoresce . this result ruled out the possibility that _PROTEIN_ was anchored in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . however protoplastation represents severe stress for the cells which could have caused down regulation of _PROTEIN_ and/or degradation or internalization of _PROTEIN_ . in addition _PROTEIN_ was a possibly soluble protein in the cell wall and in this case the digestion of the cell wall during protoplast preparation would have led to a loss of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal . therefore cells with intact walls were imaged at a ph suitable for _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were grown in liquid culture at ph of instead of . the higher ph in the culture medium is known to recover _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the apoplast . however even under these conditions no _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ signal was detectable . in addition _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ seedlings were cultured under normal conditions to minimize any impact the alkaline culture medium may have on _PROTEIN_ distribution and infiltrated with buffer of ph just for imaging . again no _LOCATION_ signals were found in more than independent experiments . both detection methods _METHOD_ and in vivo imaging revealed the same punctate structures but no signals at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or in the _LOCATION_ space . at higher magnifications some of the _PROTEIN_ specific punctate signals appeared as doughnut or horseshoe shaped structures . this morphology is typical of _LOCATION_ stacks viewed in the middle of the _PROTEIN_ cisternae from the top . in addition the observed size between to across matched the expected size of _LOCATION_ stacks . in order to corroborate that _PROTEIN_ was localized in these organelles the dye was applied . is endocytosed by the cell sequentially staining the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ endosomes and the trans _LOCATION_ network but not the _LOCATION_ apparatus . imaging infiltrated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ seedlings did not reveal any co localization of the _METHOD_ dye and the _METHOD_ signal even min after the infiltration . identification of _PROTEIN_ positive structures as _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ images of epidermal cells from cotyledons are shown . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ is shown in green the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in magenta . the images from the two _METHOD_ detection channels were merged with the co localization finder plugin and co localization of the green and magenta signals resulted in white spots . scale bars . transgenic seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were treated with by vacuum infiltration . a section of the lower epidermis is shown after min of treatment . two guard cells of a transgenic seedling co _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ rab are shown . transgenic seedlings co _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and either _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were imaged . the distribution of the green and magenta pixels in the dual channel overlay images in a d were analyzed with the imagej colocalization threshold and tool . the x axes represent the intensities of the green pixels from the _METHOD_ channel _PROTEIN_ and the y axes from the magenta channel _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . for each scatterplot the intensities are given as the pixel grey values ranging from to . co localization clusters the pixels from both channels along a diagonal line . the maximal theoretical value for the pearson s correlation coefficient is . as an additional negative endosomal control co localization with the _PROTEIN_ rab was studied . there is some controversy in the literature over the designation of rab as a marker protein for the _LOCATION_ or the post _LOCATION_ compartment . however there is consensus that rab primarily co localizes with rat sialyltransferase a trans _LOCATION_ and/or trans _LOCATION_ network marker protein and that it also associates with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . therefore rab is believed to play a role in the trafficking of secretory vesicles from the _LOCATION_ to the pm . in transgenic plants co _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ rab and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ no overlap of the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was found . the lack of overlap not only suggests the absence of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in endosomes but also ruled out crosstalk between the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ detection channels . in order to confirm that the chosen _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ settings were specific for the detection of the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ respectively transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ only one of the two fluorophores were imaged sequentially with the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ settings . when imaging epidermal cells from the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plant with the _METHOD_ settings the familiar dot like structures appeared in the _METHOD_ detection channel . taking an image of the identical epidermal section with the _METHOD_ settings however did not deliver this punctate pattern . the same imaging experiment with a plant _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ only showed negligible bleed through of the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ into the _METHOD_ detection channel . these control experiments demonstrated the specificity of the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ detection settings . in a direct localization approach the occurrence of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ apparatus was investigated by co localization with three known arabidopsis _LOCATION_ resident proteins . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are snare proteins localized in the _LOCATION_ apparatus . _LOCATION_ was found in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of saccharomyces cerevisiae and its homolog in arabidopsis was also localized in the _LOCATION_ . transgenic plants co _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and either the _LOCATION_ marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ homolog were analyzed by confocal microscopy . the _METHOD_ of all three _LOCATION_ marker proteins overlapped with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localizing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to the _LOCATION_ apparatus . to exclude or confirm a co localization not only by eye the imagej software was applied . the overlays of the images from the two detection channels were used to generate scatterplots and to calculate the pearson s correlation coefficient of the two _METHOD_ signals . rr values > indicate co localization verifying co localization of all three marker proteins _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ homolog with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in order to confirm the co localization results _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was labeled with gold particles using _METHOD_ primary antibodies and secondary gold coupled secondary antibodies . electron microscopy of tokuyasu cryo sections through roots revealed weak but specific staining of _LOCATION_ stacks . in sections through _LOCATION_ compartments equaling an area of gold particles per were counted . considering only labeled _LOCATION_ compartments increased the value to particles per . by comparison only and gold particles per were found in sections through mitochondria and _LOCATION_ respectively . multivesicular bodies were also positively immunolabeled by gold particles which most likely reflects the transport of some _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to the _LOCATION_ as seen in other _METHOD_ overexpressing plants rather than a functional role of _PROTEIN_ in this prevacuolar compartment . no immunolabeling of any other cellular compartment including the cell wall was found . in summary the immunogold labeling studies of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ confirmed its localization in the _LOCATION_ and gave no indication of an _LOCATION_ occurrence . confirmation of the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ by immunogold labeling . transverse tokuyasu cryo sections through root tips were imaged by tem after imunogold labeling of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ using _METHOD_ antibodies and protein a nm gold . arrows mark gold particles . independent experiments with protein a nm gold gave the same localization results presented here . both approaches were repeated three times . abbreviations cw cell wall g _LOCATION_ stack mvb multivesicular body . scale bars equal nm in a and nm in b d. if the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ were correct _PROTEIN_ should exhibit the substrate specificity typical of _LOCATION_ apyrases . therefore the activity of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was tested in the presence of known apyrase substrates at ph which equals the ph found in the _LOCATION_ . amp is not a substrate for apyrases and for this reason served as a negative control . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not hydrolyze _PROTEIN_ and adp the typical substrates of ecto apyrases but the nucleotides uridine diphosphate guanosine diphosphate and inosine diphosphate . no activity was detectable in the presence of all other ntps or ndps and amp . hydrolysis of these three ndps matches the substrate specificity of other plant _LOCATION_ apyrases e. g. from rice and sycamore . substrate specificity of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the activity of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the presence of various substrates at ph was measured . different letters above the columns indicate mean values that are significantly different from one other . _LOCATION_ bars represent standard deviations of duplicate measurements from one reaction . the data are representative of five activity assays with independent protein extracts . abbreviation pi inorganic phosphate . in order to investigate the possibility that the substrate specificity was ph dependent and that it would change in favor of _PROTEIN_ and adp once _PROTEIN_ reached the apoplast the activity assay of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was repeated at ph the ph typically found in the cell wall . however the three diphosphates udp gdp and idp remained the only substrates . therefore the determined substrate specificity substantiated the results that _PROTEIN_ was not observed in the cell wall but in the _LOCATION_ . one objective was to determine if _PROTEIN_ was a soluble protein in the lumen of the _LOCATION_ or as implied by the tmhmm prediction program a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein with an uncleaved signal sequence at the n terminus serving as a transmembrane anchor . this prediction was supported by the immunogold labeling results which suggested a _LOCATION_ association of the protein . analysis of the solubility of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the output of the tmhmm prediction program is shown . the _PROTEIN_ aa sequence is represented along the x axis with the n terminal aa being the first residue . the probability for each aa to appear within a transmembrane domain is given . one tm is predicted which comprises the aa . microsomal _LOCATION_ were prepared from transgenic plants containing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . equal amounts of _LOCATION_ fractions were treated either with extraction buffer _PROTEIN_ m nacl m or m urea . after a min treatment the proteins were subjected to centrifugation at g. the pellet fractions and the supernatants were separated in a _PROTEIN_ polyacrylamide gel blotted on a nitrocellulose _LOCATION_ and incubated with _METHOD_ antibodies . the molecular weights of the protein standard are given in kda . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein and a second band at kda were detected with mouse igg coupled with horseradish peroxidase . similar results were obtained in three experiments with independent protein extracts . microsomal _LOCATION_ were isolated from transgenic _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ seedlings and their purity was verified with antibodies against marker proteins for _LOCATION_ and insoluble proteins . the microsomal _LOCATION_ were treated with various solubilizing agents and then analyzed for any solubilized proteins . using _METHOD_ antibodies a major signal was observed at the expected molecular _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and a minor signal at kda . the smaller protein most likely represents a degradation product of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ resulting from the protein extraction procedure . if the microsomal _LOCATION_ were left untreated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was detected in the _LOCATION_ fraction suggesting that the protein was _LOCATION_ bound . in support of this finding the detergent _PROTEIN_ released the majority of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein from the _LOCATION_ . in order to differentiate between _PROTEIN_ being a peripheral or an integral _LOCATION_ protein the microsomal _LOCATION_ were subjected to high salt alkaline and denaturing conditions . peripheral proteins are removed from _LOCATION_ by urea which disturbs protein protein interactions or by high salt and alkaline treatments which disrupt electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions respectively . except for trace amounts the salt and treatment did shift _PROTEIN_ from the pellet fraction to the supernatant as expected for an integral _LOCATION_ protein . _PROTEIN_ is also not a _LOCATION_ soluble protein because _PROTEIN_ remained in the pellet fraction after treatment which is known to leach the soluble proteins from the microsomal lumen into the supernatant fraction as shown in _PROTEIN_ . urea released some _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein into the supernatant but most of the protein remained in the _LOCATION_ fraction . although transmembrane proteins are generally not extracted by urea at all type ii integral proteins seem to be less tightly associated with the _LOCATION_ than proteins with multiple transmembrane domains . in summary _PROTEIN_ showed the characteristics of a single pass type ii _LOCATION_ protein .
for all experiments the a. thaliana ecotype wassilewskija was used as the wt control . seedlings were grown for one week under sterile conditions on agar plates _METHOD_ salts g l mes ph sucrose agar or in liquid medium under shaking . after one week on agar plates seedlings were transferred to soil and grown at and a h photoperiod at photons m s . the term sko refers to the homozygous presence of the null alleles of either the _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ or the _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ . the t dna null mutations _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ refer to the mutant alleles _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively as described in steinebrunner et al . _PROTEIN_ . the symbol refers to the wt counterpart of the mutant allele . two types of apyrase dko mutants were generated dko snap _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and dko _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . both types of dko mutants carried the _PROTEIN_ gene under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter . the details of the construct _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were published in _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is the promoter region of the shaker pollen inward k channel gene _PROTEIN_ specifically in pollen and pollen tubes _PROTEIN_ . the open reading frame of _PROTEIN_ fused to the snap tag sequence was cloned under the control of the native _PROTEIN_ promoter region _PROTEIN_ with the gateway technology . the _PROTEIN_ snap sequence is shown in the additional file . for the snap tagging the stop codon was removed from the _PROTEIN_ sequence to create a c terminal fusion to the tag . the vector psnap tag was used as the pcr template for the snap tag sequence . the primer pair for the amplification produced a bp product and contained the following snap specific sequences gactgcgaaatgaagcgca and ttaaggcttgcccagtctgtg . the reverse primer introduced the stop codon . the entry clone for each of the three dna elements was generated by recombining the respective pcr product with the matching pdonr vector . the necessary recombination sites were introduced into the pcr product through the primer sequences . the three entry clones were recombined with the binary destination vector _PROTEIN_ to form the final construct _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ snap . the sequences of the entry clones and the _PROTEIN_ clone were confirmed by sequencing . the agrobacterium tumefaciens strain _PROTEIN_ was transformed with the _PROTEIN_ clone and then used for transformation of apyrase mutants which were hemizygous for the _PROTEIN_ mutation homozygous for the _PROTEIN_ mutation _PROTEIN_ and contained the construct _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the plants were transformed by the floral dip method _PROTEIN_ . transgenic lines were grown on agar plates containing hygromycin phosphinothricin _PROTEIN_ and kanamycin . hygromycin selected for the presence of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ snap _PROTEIN_ for the presence of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and kanamycin for the presence of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . the cloning of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct is described in detail in _PROTEIN_ . the orf of _PROTEIN_ without the stop codon was amplified by pcr and cloned into the pqe vector . for the amplification of the _METHOD_ cdna the pbin _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ served as the template . the pcr product was cloned in frame with the _PROTEIN_ sequence already present in pqe to enable a translational fusion of _METHOD_ with the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ . the resulting conjugated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ orf was amplified and subcloned into the topo _PROTEIN_ vector . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ cdna was released by ecori digestion and cloned into the binary vector . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ sequence is available as additional file . the transgenic line _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ tag alone is available from the arabidopsis resource center . wt wassilewskija plants were transformed with the help of agrobacteria containing the recombinant construct by the floral dip method _PROTEIN_ . transformants were selected on agar plates containing kanamycin . for genetic complementation experiments homozygous _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic lines were crossed with _PROTEIN_ sko plants hemizygous for the _PROTEIN_ mutation and carrying the _PROTEIN_ cdna under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . kanamycin resistant progeny were genotyped by pcr . _PROTEIN_ sko plants containing the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were crossed with _PROTEIN_ sko plants hemizygous for the _PROTEIN_ mutation and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the progeny were selected on kanamycin and _PROTEIN_ . for the screening for complemented apyrase dko snap and dko _METHOD_ mutants genomic dna was extracted from candidate plants as described elsewhere . for detection of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the used primer combinations are described in _PROTEIN_ except for the reverse _PROTEIN_ specific primer which was changed to yielding a pcr product of kb . the presence of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ snap construct was confirmed using the snap specific primer and the _PROTEIN_ specific primer located in exon . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct was amplified using the _PROTEIN_ forward primer and a reverse primer located in the _METHOD_ sequence _METHOD_ resulting in a pcr product of kb . four transgenic lines generated by geldner et al . _PROTEIN_ either the marker _METHOD_ rab _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter were obtained from the nottingham arabidopsis stock centre . the lines were validated by antibiotic selection and genomic pcr as suggested by geldner et al . . homozygous transgenic _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants were crossed with either homozygous _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ homolog _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants . the progeny were selected on agar plates containing kanamycin and either _PROTEIN_ for the crosses with the _METHOD_ fusion constructs or hygromycin for the crosses with the _METHOD_ fusion construct . double resistant seedlings were genotyped for the existence of the desired fusion constructs before analyzing them by confocal microscopy . ten day old _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic seedlings from a liquid culture were digested over night at in buffer bovine serum albumin freshly added cellulase onozuka rs and macerozyme r from rhizopus sp . . ten day old dko snap seedlings were fixed in paraformaldehyde for h and treated with cellulase onozuka rs and macerozyme r from rhizopus sp . for min at . after washing twice with phosphate buffered saline _PROTEIN_ the samples were treated with triton x for h at room temperature . to inactivate all endogenous peroxidases the samples were incubated in methanol hydrogen peroxide for min at rt in the dark . after washing with water the seedlings were treated with ethanol for min washed twice with _PROTEIN_ and blocked with skim milk for min . incubation with polyclonal rabbit snap antibody _METHOD_ skim milk followed for at least h at rt . after washing three times with _PROTEIN_ the seedlings were incubated for at least h at rt with goat rabbit igg conjugated with horseradish peroxidase diluted in skim milk . after removing the secondary antibody by washing three times with _PROTEIN_ the seedlings were treated with fluorescein isothiocyanate tyramides in ml amplification buffer for at least h at rt or at overnight in the dark . fitc tyramides were prepared according to pernthaler et al . and kindly provided by kerstin . the samples were washed three times with _PROTEIN_ and stored for imaging in _PROTEIN_ . root tips of six day old _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic seedlings were fixed with pfa in m phosphate buffer _PROTEIN_ for min h in pfa followed by postfixation in _METHOD_ . fixed samples were whole mount immunolabeled with rabbit _METHOD_ and goat rabbit alexa fluor and then embedded in technovit as previously described . three sections were analyzed with the _METHOD_ microscope keyence bz . seven to ten day old _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic seedlings were vacuum infiltrated with in m tris hcl ph . for the alkali treatment two approaches were taken _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ seedlings were cultured in regular liquid _METHOD_ medium for five days transferred to alkaline _METHOD_ medium and grown for three more days before imaging or the seedlings were grown in regular liquid _METHOD_ medium for eight days and infiltrated with tap water or tris buffered saline ph for at least h before imaging . for the imaging of dko snap plants the leica confocal and multiphoton microscope tcs _PROTEIN_ was used . to avoid bleaching of fitc the samples were mounted with antifade octane in m tris hcl ph water ml glycerine . the fitc signals were captured using a leica water immersion objective . the detector range was set to to nm . the _METHOD_ of the wt seedlings was captured with the same parameters and settings as described for fitc . spectral images of the wt and the dko snap samples were analyzed by linear unmixing with the dye separation tool of the leica software _PROTEIN_ to identify fitc specific signals . transgenic plant material containing the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct were imaged with the zeiss axio imager connected to the laser scanning microscope lsm or . six to d old seedlings were imaged in water and protoplasts in sorbitol buffer ph without the enzymes . the images
