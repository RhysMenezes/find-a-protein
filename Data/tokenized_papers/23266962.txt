adp ribosylation _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a member of the small _PROTEIN_ binding proteins plays a pivotal role in protein trafficking to multiple organelles . in its gdp bound form _PROTEIN_ is recruited from the _LOCATION_ to organelle _LOCATION_ where it functions in vesicle mediated protein trafficking . however the mechanism of _PROTEIN_ gdp recruitment remains unknown . here we provide evidence that two type arf _PROTEIN_ activating proteins arfgap _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are involved in the recruitment of _PROTEIN_ gdp to the _LOCATION_ apparatus in arabidopsis . rna interference plants _PROTEIN_ low levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ exhibited abnormal _LOCATION_ morphology inhibition of protein trafficking and arrest of plant growth and development . in rna interference plants _PROTEIN_ was poorly recruited to the _LOCATION_ apparatus . conversely high levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ induced _PROTEIN_ accumulation at the _LOCATION_ and suppressed _LOCATION_ disruption and inhibition of _LOCATION_ trafficking that was caused by overexpression of _PROTEIN_ . based on these results we propose that the type arfgaps _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ recruit _PROTEIN_ gdp from the _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ for _PROTEIN_ mediated protein trafficking which is essential for plant development and growth .
the large number of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis can be classified into six subfamilies according to their sequence homology . to obtain insight into the physiological roles of _PROTEIN_ we focused on one subfamily that contains three _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . they exhibit the closest relationship to the type arfgaps that are involved in _PROTEIN_ vesicle biogenesis at the _LOCATION_ apparatus . the public microarray data revealed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ at high levels in most tissues whereas _PROTEIN_ is strongly _PROTEIN_ in stamens moderately in root xylem cells but virtually undetectable in other tissues . we screened arabidopsis mutants that had transfer dna insertions in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the lack of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts in the mutants was confirmed by reverse transcription pcr and quantitative reverse transcription pcr . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was greatly induced in _PROTEIN_ mutants suggesting that the lack of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ somehow resulted in the induction of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in a compensatory manner . the mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ did not exhibit any noticeable phenotypes which may result from a functional redundancy of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ similar to what has been observed for and in animal cells . accordingly _PROTEIN_ double mutant plants were screened from progeny from the cross of the and _PROTEIN_ single homozygote mutants . however after screening greater than plants no double homozygotes were obtained . this raised the possibility that the homozygotes of the _PROTEIN_ double mutant are lethal . to test this hypothesis individual plants from the cross of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutants were examined for their genotype by the pcr approach and allowed to self pollinate . their siliques representing various genotypes were examined for seed production . in support of this hypothesis of the ovules were aborted in the siliques of self pollinated plants with the genotype _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . similar to that of the heterozygous/homozygous double mutant for _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant produced aborted seeds in siliques of self pollinated plants . in contrast the abortion rate in wild type plants or heterozygote plants for both loci _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was almost negligible . this result indicates that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are functionally redundant and play essential roles in plant development . as a result to investigate the physiological role of type arfgaps in arabidopsis transgenic rna interference plants were generated that have low _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the two abundantly _PROTEIN_ type arfgaps . to simultaneously knock down both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts a bp fragment of _PROTEIN_ that contained a high degree of nucleotide sequence homology to _PROTEIN_ was used . this fragment was placed under the control of the dexamethasone inducible promoter . the resulting rnai construct was cloned into a binary vector and used to generate transgenic plants . multiple independent lines were obtained and their phenotypes were examined in the presence and absence of dex . the rnai plants did not display any noticeable phenotypes in the absence of dex . however when placed on plates containing dex multiple lines of rnai plants germinated but failed to develop into mature plants . in contrast wild type plants germinated and developed normally _PROTEIN_ of dex treatment . qrt pcr was used to analyze the rna levels of various _PROTEIN_ isoform genes in the rnai plants . the transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ gradually _PROTEIN_ in dex treated rnai plants with increasing time . similarly the _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were significantly reduced with time albeit to a slightly lesser degree . the transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ also were greatly reduced in dex treated rnai plants . in contrast the transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ that belong to two different subfamilies of the _PROTEIN_ family were barely or slightly reduced in the dex treated rnai plants respectively suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ rnai construct is specific to the members of the type arfgap subfamily among _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . these results are consistent with the inability to generate a double homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant . in comparison with other adg mutants the rnai plants displayed a much more severe phenotype raising the possibility that _PROTEIN_ are involved in more general physiological processes that are necessary for plant growth and development . to gain an insight into the physiological role of these proteins we initially determined the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ . previous studies in arabidopsis show that two other _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ localize to the trans _LOCATION_ network and _LOCATION_ apparatus respectively . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were fused to the human influenza hemagglutinin epitope . ha _PROTEIN_ and ha _PROTEIN_ under the control of their native promoters were transformed into wild type plants or transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a chimeric fusion construct between rat sialyltransferase _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ that localizes to the _LOCATION_ apparatus . in root tissues of transgenic plants both ha _PROTEIN_ and ha _PROTEIN_ produced punctate staining patterns that closely overlapped with those of stably _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ when detected by using an ha antibody . to quantify the degree of overlap between ha _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the images from a microscope were subject to pearson spearman correlation colocalization analysis and scatterplots of _METHOD_ pixels across the two channels were obtained . the scatterplots together with the psc coefficient values of and for colocalization between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and ha _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ respectively confirmed that ha _PROTEIN_ and ha _PROTEIN_ colocalize with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the psc coefficient values range from to for strong negative and positive correlation respectively . next we compared the localization of ha _PROTEIN_ and ha _PROTEIN_ with the prevacuolar compartment localized _PROTEIN_ or tgn localized _PROTEIN_ detected with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ antibodies . neither ha _PROTEIN_ nor ha _PROTEIN_ colocalized with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ consistent with the notion that they do localize to the _LOCATION_ apparatus . again the degree of overlap was tested by the psc colocalization analysis . the scatterplots for the colocalization of ha _PROTEIN_ or ha _PROTEIN_ with pvc localized _PROTEIN_ or tgn localized _PROTEIN_ show a separated distribution pattern of two _METHOD_ pixels and gave the psc coefficient value close to indicating that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ do not localize to the tgn or pvc . _PROTEIN_ of ha _PROTEIN_ and ha _PROTEIN_ in these transgenic plants was confirmed by western blot analysis using the ha antibody . to further confirm their localization at the single cell level protoplasts from transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ ha _PROTEIN_ or ha _PROTEIN_ were immunostained with an ha antibody . both proteins produced punctate staining patterns in protoplasts as observed in intact tissues . next we compared their localization with other _LOCATION_ proteins in protoplasts . as _LOCATION_ proteins we used transiently _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and endogenous _PROTEIN_ a component of _PROTEIN_ detected by _PROTEIN_ antibody . in protoplasts both ha _PROTEIN_ and ha _PROTEIN_ that had been _PROTEIN_ in transgenic plants closely overlapped with transiently _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . furthermore ha _PROTEIN_ colocalized with endogenous _PROTEIN_ . the colocalization of ha _PROTEIN_ with _LOCATION_ markers was confirmed by the psc colocalization analysis . together these results confirmed that both ha _PROTEIN_ and ha _PROTEIN_ localize to the _LOCATION_ apparatus . next we examined the localization of transiently _PROTEIN_ ha _PROTEIN_ and ha _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts since we wanted to examine their behavior after transient _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts . it has been thought that the transient _PROTEIN_ of proteins in protoplasts could lead to mislocalization due to possible overexpression . first ha _PROTEIN_ or ha _PROTEIN_ was transformed into wild type protoplasts together with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and their localization was examined . both transiently _PROTEIN_ ha _PROTEIN_ and ha _PROTEIN_ produced punctate staining patterns that closely overlapped with those of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . moreover transiently _PROTEIN_ ha _PROTEIN_ closely overlapped with endogenous _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ apparatus . together these results confirmed that transiently _PROTEIN_ ha _PROTEIN_ and ha _PROTEIN_ also localize to the _LOCATION_ apparatus . their localization to the _LOCATION_ is similar to that of in animal cells . the successful localization of _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ apparatus encouraged us to examine whether lower levels of _PROTEIN_ in rnai plants had any effect on the _LOCATION_ apparatus . rnai plants and control plants harboring the empty vector were grown on murashige and skoog _METHOD_ medium and then transplanted onto _METHOD_ plates supplemented with dex . two days after transplanting the root tissues were immunostained with _PROTEIN_ antibody . in pta plants _PROTEIN_ antibody produced numerous punctae . in contrast _PROTEIN_ antibody in the rnai plants displayed a diffuse staining pattern and fewer punctae . the number of punctae in the rnai plants was reduced to of the level in pta plants raising an intriguing possibility that the _LOCATION_ apparatus is disassembled in rnai plants . this is in contrast to previous studies on other arfgaps where overexpression of and _PROTEIN_ in animal and arabidopsis cells respectively caused disassembly of the _LOCATION_ apparatus . to confirm this observation ultrathin sections of root tissue were cut from rnai and pta plants that had been treated with or without dex for d and examined for the presence and morphology of the _LOCATION_ apparatus by electron microscopy . in control plants _METHOD_ the _LOCATION_ apparatus exhibited a normal morphology with five to six stacks . however in dex treated rnai plants the _LOCATION_ apparatus contained only one or two stacks indicating that the _LOCATION_ apparatus is partially disassembled in dex treated rnai plants . these results suggest that normal _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ levels are crucial for the _PROTEIN_ of the _LOCATION_ morphology . a previous study in animal cells demonstrated that knockdown of both and in animal cells caused similar alterations in _LOCATION_ morphology . thus it is possible that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are functional orthologs of the type arfgaps in animal cells . to functionally confirm the _LOCATION_ defect in the rnai plants protein trafficking in the rnai plants was examined . if _PROTEIN_ are arabidopsis orthologs of type arfgaps they are likely to be involved in a _PROTEIN_ related process _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as observed for arfgaps . however it is technically very difficult to monitor retrograde trafficking in plant cells . instead the functionality of the _LOCATION_ apparatus was tested by _LOCATION_ trafficking because _LOCATION_ proteins are transported through the _LOCATION_ apparatus on their way from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ . for _LOCATION_ cargo we used sporamin _METHOD_ a fusion protein between the sweet potato protein sporamin and _METHOD_ that is targeted to the _LOCATION_ and processed to produce the _METHOD_ fragment . protoplasts from the rnai plants were transformed with sporamin _METHOD_ and incubated with or without dex . sporamin _METHOD_ trafficking to the _LOCATION_ was examined by western blot analysis using a _METHOD_ antibody . wild type protoplasts were included in the analysis . in dex treated rnai protoplasts the efficiency of protein trafficking was compared with in dex untreated rnai or wild type protoplasts at h after transformation supporting the notion that the dex treated rnai plants contain a functionally defective _LOCATION_ apparatus . to gain an insight into the underlying mechanism of how the lower levels of _PROTEIN_ cause a defect in _LOCATION_ morphology and a perturbation of _LOCATION_ trafficking in a reverse approach to the rnai plants we examined the effect of _PROTEIN_ overexpression on the _LOCATION_ apparatus . previous studies demonstrated that overexpression of arfgaps such as and _PROTEIN_ caused disassembly of the _LOCATION_ apparatus . for this experiment we took advantage of the protoplast system in which protein levels can be easily increased by increasing the amount of plasmid dna introduced into protoplasts . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was cotransformed into protoplasts together with increasing amounts of ha _PROTEIN_ and the localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was examined in protoplasts . _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ levels ha _PROTEIN_ overexpression did not alter the punctate staining pattern of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in contrast as reported previously _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ produced a diffuse pattern with a gradual _PROTEIN_ in the number of punctae with increasing amounts of ha _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ levels of ha _PROTEIN_ and ha _PROTEIN_ were determined by western blot analysis using an ha antibody . in _PROTEIN_ the protein levels of ha _PROTEIN_ were to fold higher than those of ha _PROTEIN_ at the same amounts of plasmid dna in protoplasts . similar to ha _PROTEIN_ ha _PROTEIN_ did not affect the localization pattern of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . this result raises the possibility that the physiological role of _PROTEIN_ is different from that of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ plays a crucial role in the _PROTEIN_ of the _LOCATION_ apparatus . to gain insight into the molecular _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ that underlie their roles in the _PROTEIN_ of the _LOCATION_ apparatus at the biochemical level we examined whether these proteins interact with _PROTEIN_ by coimmunoprecipitation experiments . _PROTEIN_ ha or _PROTEIN_ ha was cotransformed into protoplasts together with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and protein extracts from transformed protoplasts were used for immunoprecipitation with a _METHOD_ antibody . the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by western blotting using ha and _METHOD_ antibodies . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was included as a positive control . as reported previously _PROTEIN_ ha was detected in the immunoprecipitates obtained with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ ha was detected in the immunoprecipitates obtained with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ indicating that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interact with _PROTEIN_ . ha _PROTEIN_ coprecipitated with both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ indicating that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interact with _PROTEIN_ . to further confirm and characterize this interaction at the cellular level in vivo we examined the interaction of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ via a bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation approach . to reduce the nonspecific background signals in the bifc experiments the c terminal half of cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and the n terminal half of the _METHOD_ variant venus were used . _PROTEIN_ ha was fused to the c terminus of nvn . _PROTEIN_ ha was included as a control . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were fused to the n terminus of _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ the gdp bound form of _PROTEIN_ was used as a control for the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . as a negative control _METHOD_ was tagged with a small epitope at the n terminus . again we relied on the transient _PROTEIN_ of these proteins in protoplasts because transiently _PROTEIN_ ha _PROTEIN_ and ha _PROTEIN_ properly localized to the _LOCATION_ apparatus in protoplasts . nvn _PROTEIN_ ha or nvn _PROTEIN_ ha was introduced into protoplasts together with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ . the amount of nvn _PROTEIN_ ha and nvn _PROTEIN_ ha introduced into protoplasts was carefully controlled because _PROTEIN_ overexpression induces disassembly of the _LOCATION_ apparatus . the control protoplasts _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ did not display any signals confirming that nonspecific interactions between _METHOD_ and nvn were undetectable . when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was introduced into protoplasts together with nvn _PROTEIN_ ha or nvn _PROTEIN_ ha strong bifc signals were observed as punctate staining patterns in the protoplasts together with weak _LOCATION_ signals . next _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the gdp bound form was cotransformed into protoplasts together with nvn _PROTEIN_ ha or nvn _PROTEIN_ ha and bifc signals were examined . the protoplasts cotransformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and nvn _PROTEIN_ ha produced diffuse _LOCATION_ patterns but did not show any punctate bifc signals indicating that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may interact in the _LOCATION_ but not at the _LOCATION_ apparatus . unexpectedly protoplasts cotransformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and nvn _PROTEIN_ ha produced strong punctate staining patterns raising the possibility that _PROTEIN_ binds to gdp bound _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ apparatus . however this interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ apparatus is not consistent with current ideas about the role of arfgaps which can be demonstrated by the _PROTEIN_ that ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ causes disassembly of the _LOCATION_ apparatus . to confirm the _PROTEIN_ of these constructs in protoplasts protein extracts from transformed protoplasts were analyzed by western blotting using ha and _METHOD_ antibodies . as expected all these proteins were _PROTEIN_ at comparable levels . during cycling between the gdp and _PROTEIN_ bound _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ gdp transiently localizes to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ where the bound gdp is replaced with _PROTEIN_ by a gef . thus it is possible that _PROTEIN_ are involved in the recruitment of gdp bound _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ apparatus . to test for this possibility the gdp bound form of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was fused to superfolder _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and the resulting construct _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was introduced into protoplasts alone or together with ha _PROTEIN_ ha _PROTEIN_ or ha _PROTEIN_ and then the localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was examined . a previous study demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ a dominant negative mutant form of _PROTEIN_ caused disassembly of the _LOCATION_ apparatus in plant cells . moreover protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ alone produced a diffuse pattern . coexpression of ha _PROTEIN_ did not change the diffuse pattern of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in protoplasts . however in the presence of ha _PROTEIN_ or ha _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ primarily produced the punctate staining patterns and weak _LOCATION_ patterns indicating that the majority of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localizes to the _LOCATION_ apparatus . this _METHOD_ that high levels of _PROTEIN_ cause the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ apparatus . _PROTEIN_ of ha _PROTEIN_ ha _PROTEIN_ and ha _PROTEIN_ was confirmed by western blot analysis using an ha antibody . the localization of _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ apparatus contradicted the previous results showing that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ causes disassembly of the _LOCATION_ apparatus in plant cells . however it should be noted that wild type protoplasts should contain endogenous _PROTEIN_ and when _PROTEIN_ is ectopically _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts the effect observed should be the result of competition between endogenous _PROTEIN_ and ectopically _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . therefore the disassembly of the _LOCATION_ apparatus should be highly dependent on the concentration of _PROTEIN_ . one possible explanation for the presence of the _LOCATION_ apparatus in protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is that the effective concentration of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the protoplasts coexpressing _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ should be lower that of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the absence of _PROTEIN_ because these _PROTEIN_ bind to _PROTEIN_ which in turn results in prevention of the _LOCATION_ disruption to a certain extent . in addition there could be other _METHOD_ for the protection of the _LOCATION_ . in yeast cells type _PROTEIN_ gap was identified as a high copy suppressor of temperature sensitive _PROTEIN_ a gdp bound dominant negative mutant . this is very much reminiscent of the effect we observed with _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts . furthermore type arfgaps interact with coat proteins through the c terminal domain . therefore overexpression of type arfgaps may bring coat proteins to the _LOCATION_ apparatus which in turn results in protection of the _LOCATION_ even in the presence of _PROTEIN_ . to obtain more direct evidence that _PROTEIN_ are involved in recruiting _PROTEIN_ gdp to the _LOCATION_ apparatus the targeting rate of _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ apparatus was examined in wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and rnai plants using _METHOD_ recovery after photobleaching with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . first localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to the _LOCATION_ apparatus was examined in protoplasts . protoplasts from wild type plants were cotransformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and localization of these proteins was examined . both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ produced punctate staining patterns that closely overlapped confirming that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ primarily localizes to the _LOCATION_ apparatus in protoplasts from leaf tissues . a minor portion of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not colocalize with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ suggesting that a minor pool of _PROTEIN_ may localize in the _LOCATION_ or to other organelles . based on this finding frap experiments were performed using protoplasts from wild type or rnai plants that were cotransformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and incubated with dex or _METHOD_ for h. the punctae where both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ colocalized were then photobleached using a laser . subsequently the time course of recovery of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization to the _LOCATION_ apparatus was examined . the half recovery times were and s in dex treated rnai plants _METHOD_ treated rnai plants and dex treated wild type plants respectively . thus the recovery time in dex treated rnai plants was delayed by more than fold with respect to the recovery time of dex treated wild type or _METHOD_ treated rnai plants . these results confirm the idea that _PROTEIN_ are involved in the targeting of _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ apparatus . as controls _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutant plants without dex or _METHOD_ treatment were included in the frap analysis . the half recovery times in and _PROTEIN_ plants were and s respectively indicating that the recovery time in these mutants is not significantly different from that of wild type plants . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ causes disassembly of the _LOCATION_ apparatus through premature hydrolysis of _PROTEIN_ bound to _PROTEIN_ and results in an inhibition of _LOCATION_ trafficking . thus we tested whether the overexpression of _PROTEIN_ prevents the _LOCATION_ disassembly caused by _PROTEIN_ overexpression . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and ha _PROTEIN_ were cotransformed into protoplasts with or without _PROTEIN_ and the localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was examined . in protoplasts _PROTEIN_ only ha _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ produced a network pattern an indication of its localization to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ that resulted from disassembly of the _LOCATION_ apparatus as demonstrated previously . in contrast in protoplasts _PROTEIN_ both _PROTEIN_ and ha _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ exhibited primarily the punctate staining pattern indicating that the overexpression of _PROTEIN_ suppressed the _PROTEIN_ induced _LOCATION_ disassembly . to confirm this at the functional level we determined the trafficking efficiency of sporamin _METHOD_ to the _LOCATION_ in the presence of _PROTEIN_ alone or together with _PROTEIN_ . increasing amounts of _PROTEIN_ were introduced into protoplasts together with ha _PROTEIN_ and sporamin _METHOD_ and the _LOCATION_ trafficking efficiency of sporamin _METHOD_ was examined by western blot analysis using a _METHOD_ antibody . as observed previously _PROTEIN_ of ha _PROTEIN_ caused a reduction in the _LOCATION_ trafficking efficiency of sporamin _METHOD_ compared with control protoplasts without ha _PROTEIN_ at h after transformation . however in protoplasts coexpressing both ha _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the trafficking efficiency of sporamin _METHOD_ to the _LOCATION_ increased gradually with increasing amounts of _PROTEIN_ . these results support the notion that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ suppressed ha _PROTEIN_ induced _LOCATION_ disassembly thereby resulting in an increase in the trafficking efficiency of sporamin _METHOD_ to the _LOCATION_ . of course we can not completely exclude the possibility that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ activates a _LOCATION_ independent route for the trafficking of sporamin _METHOD_ to the _LOCATION_ .
arabidopsis was grown on _METHOD_ plates at in a culture room or in a greenhouse under conditions of relative humidity and a h light/dark cycle . the generation of transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was described previously . the construction of _PROTEIN_ has been described previously . the _PROTEIN_ complementary dna was amplified via pcr using the primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was amplified via pcr using the primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to tag _PROTEIN_ with a small epitope at the n terminus _PROTEIN_ was inserted into the vector using ecori and sali sites and subsequently _PROTEIN_ was placed under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter in a puc vector using xbai and sali sites . to generate ha _PROTEIN_ and ha _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were amplified by pcr using primer sets sma _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and sma _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ respectively . the resulting pcr products were ligated to a plasmid that contains the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter and the epitope ha after digestion with smai and xhoi . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs were generated by incorporating _PROTEIN_ without the termination codon into the n terminus of _METHOD_ . the ha tag was added to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ by two sequential pcrs first with primers ha and p and then with primers ha and p. to generate _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ fragment amplified by pcr using primers sma _PROTEIN_ and xho _PROTEIN_ was ligated to the c terminus of _METHOD_ without the termination codon . the constructs used for bifc experiments were generated using venus a variant of yellow _METHOD_ protein and cyan _METHOD_ protein a variant of _METHOD_ . briefly the n terminal region of venus was amplified using specific primers xba vn and sma vn . the resulting pcr product was fused to the n termini of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ using xbai and smai restriction sites . subsequently vn _PROTEIN_ and vn _PROTEIN_ were digested with xbai and hpai and ligated to an identically digested c terminal ha tagging vector . _METHOD_ was amplified using the specific primers bam _METHOD_ and xho _METHOD_ . the resulting pcr product was ligated to the c termini of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ after digesting with bamhi and scai . _METHOD_ was generated by replacing _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the sequences of primers are shown in supplemental table . all pcr products were sequenced . to generate rnai plants suppressing both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ an rnai construct was generated using a bp fragment of _PROTEIN_ that shows a high degree of sequence homology to _PROTEIN_ . the bp _PROTEIN_ fragment was amplified by pcr using two sets of primers bam rnai rnai and xho rnai rnai . the two amplified products were introduced sequentially into the bamhi/clai sites and xhoi/kpni sites of rnai vector phannibal . the _PROTEIN_ rnai construct in the phannibal vector was then transferred to a dex inducible binary vector . rnai transgenic plants were generated by the floral dip method . to induce _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ fragment in rnai plants rnai transgenic plants grown on _METHOD_ plates were transferred onto dex containing plates . total rnas from the rnai transgenic plants were prepared using the rneasy plant mini kit . complementary dna was prepared with the superscript ii reverse transcriptase kit according to the manufacturer s instructions . to quantify gene _PROTEIN_ levels in rnai wild type and mutant plants the stepone and steponeplus real time pcr _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were used with power sybr green pcr master mix _METHOD_ . the data were analyzed with stepone software version using the method . amplified ribosomal rna fragments were used as endogenous controls to normalize the _PROTEIN_ of the tested genes . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcript levels in wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants were determined using specific primers _PROTEIN_ f and _PROTEIN_ r for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ f and _PROTEIN_ r for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ f and _PROTEIN_ r for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ f and _PROTEIN_ r for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ f and _PROTEIN_ r for _PROTEIN_ . arabidopsis mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ containing t dna insertions in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively were obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center . homozygotes of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants were screened by pcr based genotyping using left border primers and gene specific primers _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . for transient _PROTEIN_ experiments in protoplasts plasmid dna was purified using the qiagen column and was then transformed into protoplasts derived from leaf tissues . protein extracts were prepared from transformed protoplasts and used for western blot analysis using anti _METHOD_ and anti ha antibodies as described previously . protein extracts in immunoprecipitation buffer were incubated at for h on a rotating platform with _METHOD_ antibody and protein a sepharose beads . immune complexes were isolated using protein a sepharose beads . beads were washed five times with ip buffer . after washing proteins were released by min of incubation in _PROTEIN_ sample buffer at and analyzed by western blotting using rat ha or _METHOD_ antibodies . to prevent movement of the _LOCATION_ apparatus transformed protoplasts were incubated with latrunculin b in solution for h prior to photobleaching experiments . cells were visualized using a laser scanning confocal microscope . bundle software was used to record prebleach and postbleach signals and to modulate laser beam intensity . a dna fragment containing the _PROTEIN_ promoter region _PROTEIN_ was amplified by pcr using primers pst up _PROTEIN_ and up _PROTEIN_ ha and a dna fragment containing ha _PROTEIN_ was amplified by pcr using primers ha and stu nos t . to generate _PROTEIN_ ha _PROTEIN_ these two dna fragments were fused by the second round of pcr using primers pst up _PROTEIN_ and stu nos t . _PROTEIN_ ha _PROTEIN_ was constructed in a similar way the primers were pst up _PROTEIN_ and up _PROTEIN_ ha for a dna fragment containing the _PROTEIN_ promoter region ha and stu nos t for ha _PROTEIN_ and pst up _PROTEIN_ and stu nos t for the second round of pcr to generate _PROTEIN_ ha _PROTEIN_ . the amplified fragments were digested with psti and stui and ligated to psti and stui digested pcr ccd gateway donor vector . inserts of these constructs were introduced into the binary gateway vector by lr recombination . ha _PROTEIN_ and ha _PROTEIN_ under the control of the native promoter were introduced into wild type or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants by the floral dip method . protoplasts were allowed to adhere to poly l lys coated slides for min . protoplasts were then fixed for min in buffer containing paraformaldehyde washed three times with buffer and permeabilized in _PROTEIN_ buffer _PROTEIN_ for min . fixed protoplasts were incubated overnight at in the presence of primary antibodies _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ buffer . after four washes in _PROTEIN_ buffer cells were incubated with secondary antibodies _PROTEIN_ for h at room temperature . after four washes in _PROTEIN_ buffer cells were mounted in mowiol containing diazobicyclo octane . stained cells were visualized using a zeiss _METHOD_ microscope and a laser scanning confocal microscope . for immunostaining intact root tissues transgenic plants were

buffer the root tissues were incubated with secondary antibodies _PROTEIN_ . images were captured using a zeiss lsm meta laser scanning confocal microscope . for observations of mesophyll protoplasts and root tissues the combinations of excitation wavelength/emission filter were nm to bandpass for _METHOD_ and fitc and to bandpass for _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ . images of protoplasts were obtained using a cooled ccd camera and an axioplan _METHOD_ microscope . the filter sets were _PROTEIN_ and for _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . red _METHOD_ of chlorophyll was observed using filter set lumar . the data were processed using adobe photoshop software and the images are presented in pseudocolor . to quantify the degree of colocalization of two different proteins on an image the imagej analysis program and the psc colocalization plug in software were used . using these two software _METHOD_ we calculated the linear pearson correlation coefficient and nonlinear spearman s rank correlation coefficient of the signal intensity from the green and red channels and obtained a scatterplot with the values of _METHOD_ pixels across the two channels distributed between psc coefficient values to for strong negative and positive correlations respectively . the masking of areas was performed prior to analysis using the selection brush tool . the threshold level was set to below which pixel values were considered noise and excluded in the statistical analysis . five day old rnai or wild type plants were transferred onto _METHOD_ plates supplemented with or without dex . four days after transplanting root tissues were fixed with paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde containing sodium cacodylate buffer at for h. samples were washed three times with sodium cacodylate buffer followed by postfixation with osmium tetroxide in sodium cacodylate buffer at for h. after washing briefly with distilled water the samples were treated with uranyl acetate at for min followed by dehydration with a graded series of ethanol . dehydrated samples were infiltrated with a graded series of ethanol and spurr s resin mixtures before final embedding in spurr s resin . the infiltrated samples were polymerized at for h. after ultrathin sectioning with an ultramicrotome samples were stained with uranyl acetate and reynolds lead citrate and then examined with a transmission electron microscope operating at kv . sequence data from this article can be found in the genbank/embl data libraries under the following accession numbers _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_
