in a genetic screen of available t dna mutagenized arabidopsis populations for loci potentially involved in phytochrome signaling we identified a mutant that displayed reduced seedling deetiolation under continuous red light but little if any change in responsiveness to continuous far red light . this behavior suggests disruption of _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ signaling . we have cloned the mutant locus by using the t dna insertion and found that the disrupted gene is identical to the recently described _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gene identified as being involved in control of flowering time . the encoded _PROTEIN_ polypeptide has no sequence similarity to any known proteins in the database . however by using _PROTEIN_ and green _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ fusion constructs we have shown that _PROTEIN_ is constitutively targeted to the _LOCATION_ in transient transfection assays . optical sectioning by using the green _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ fusion protein showed green _METHOD_ throughout the nucleoplasm . thus contrary to previous computer based predictions that _PROTEIN_ would be an integral _LOCATION_ localized polypeptide the data here indicate that it is a nucleoplasmically localized protein . this result is consistent with the proposed role in _PROTEIN_ signaling given recent evidence that early phy signaling events are _LOCATION_ localized .
the mutant designated was isolated as exhibiting a long hypocotyl under rc by screening activation tagged seed pools . the bar gene present in the t dna was used to assess the number of insertion sites in the mutant . the homozygous mutant was backcrossed to wild type col and the resulting progeny were analyzed on gm suc containing basta . the basta resistant phenotype segregated with a ratio indicating that the insertion is at a single locus in the mutant . the hypocotyl length of seedlings was intermediate between that of the wild type and homozygous mutant indicating that the mutant might be semidominant . we isolated the sequence flanking the t dna insertion by using a pcr based genome walker kit _PROTEIN_ . a kb fragment was isolated by using a t dna specific primer located near the left border . blast searches using the sequence of this fragment showed identity to a region on bac at the top of chromosome annotated as orf . we also cloned and sequenced a full length cdna . the kb cdna has an orf of bp encoding a predicted aa residue protein of kda . subsequently we determined that the nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence are identical with the _PROTEIN_ sequence recently reported by fowler et al . and park et al . . therefore we have renamed our mutant gi to reflect its being a new allele of the gi mutant family . gi was isolated as a long hypocotyl mutant under rc using a single fluence rate . fig . fig refa presents a fluence rate response curve showing that gi has reduced sensitivity to all of the fluence rates of rc used . in contrast little or no differential responsiveness to increasing frc between wild type and gi seedlings was observed for the fluence rates investigated . this contrast in sensitivity of the gi mutant to rc and frc relative to wild type is most apparent when the data are normalized to the respective dark value for each line . these data indicate that the gi phenotype is light dependent and rc selective . because _PROTEIN_ is quantitatively the principal phytochrome regulating seedling deetiolation responses to rc and _PROTEIN_ is the exclusive mediator of frc signals the present data suggest that the gi mutation causes a selective reduction in _PROTEIN_ signaling with little or no effect on _PROTEIN_ signaling . we have also tested the hypocotyl phenotype of two other gi mutant alleles gi and gi . both showed slightly reduced rc sensitivity to a level that is intermediate between gi and wild type . in contrast gi and gi did not show any significant hypocotyl phenotype under frc . we examined the levels of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ by immunoblot and detected no significant reduction in the levels of these phytochromes in gi compared with the wild type . thus the hyposensitive phenotype of gi is not because of altered _PROTEIN_ of these photoreceptors . therefore we suggest that gi is a signaling mutant defective in a _PROTEIN_ that is required to facilitate signaling selectively if not specifically from _PROTEIN_ to downstream components . because gi was isolated from a transgenic line generated with an activation tagged vector we compared the _PROTEIN_ patterns of the _PROTEIN_ gene and predicted orfs on either side of the gi locus between wild type and mutant . the gi locus _PROTEIN_ a kb stable transcript compared with the kb transcript present in the wild type . the end of the _PROTEIN_ transcript is not _PROTEIN_ in the gi mutant . in addition the levels of the gi transcript as well as that of and transcripts are somewhat higher in the gi mutant than the wild type whereas the level of is slightly reduced . did not give any signal in either wild type or mutant . thus although insertional disruption of the _PROTEIN_ locus appears to be the most likely cause of the mutant phenotype the present data do not rule out contributions from the slightly altered _PROTEIN_ of the neighboring genes . because of this uncertainty we transformed the gi mutant with the wild type genomic locus containing the natural promoter and coding region of the _PROTEIN_ gene and selected independent transgenic lines that were gentamycin resistant . from these we selected two homozygous lines _PROTEIN_ with single copy insertions for further analysis of hypocotyl lengths . as shown in fig . fig refa the hypocotyl lengths of these two lines were very similar to the wild type under all rc fluence rates used whereas gi showed longer hypocotyls under the same conditions as expected . these data indicate that the insertional disruption at the gi locus is indeed the major if not exclusive cause of the hyposensitive response of the hypocotyls to rc . we initially observed that homozygous gi flowered _PROTEIN_ under wc in greenhouse conditions . we also measured flowering time of this mutant under both sd and _PROTEIN_ conditions . under sd gi flowered days _PROTEIN_ than the wild type with seven to eight more rosette leaves . however the time to flowering was greatly increased in gi relative to wild type under _PROTEIN_ . gi flowered about days _PROTEIN_ than the wild type with ca . more leaves under these conditions . these data are consistent with the known phenotype of gi mutants . to determine whether the flowering phenotype of gi was also fully complemented by the wild type _PROTEIN_ gene we examined the flowering time of the transgenically complemented lines under _PROTEIN_ conditions . as shown in fig . fig refc these lines flowered early in a manner similar to the wild type confirming that the insertional disruption at the gi locus is primarily responsible for the _PROTEIN_ flowering phenotype . additionally we found that the gi mutant failed to complement the _PROTEIN_ flowering phenotypes of gi and gi when crossed with these mutants confirming genetically that the gi is allelic to gi and gi . computer analysis of the _PROTEIN_ amino acid sequence predicted six transmembrane helices indicative of an integral _LOCATION_ protein . this observation has led to the conclusion that _PROTEIN_ may be a _LOCATION_ protein . to investigate the subcellular location of _PROTEIN_ we fused the full length polypeptide or various fragments thereof to the c terminus of gus or _METHOD_ . surprisingly the gus full length _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was clearly targeted to the _LOCATION_ in a transient transfection assay in contrast to the gus alone control which as expected was distributed throughout the cell . the localization visualized in fig . fig refb was verified by semiquantitative analysis of the subcellular distribution of gus . in this analysis we visually scored each transiently transfected cell and assigned it to one of five classes based on the intensity of gus staining in the _LOCATION_ compared with the _LOCATION_ . this analysis provides quantitative evidence that gus _PROTEIN_ is primarily targeted to the _LOCATION_ compared with the gus alone control . we also tested whether light has any effect on _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ and found that gus _PROTEIN_ is constitutively located in the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ of dark or light treatment . together with the prediction of an integral _LOCATION_ location the _LOCATION_ localization of gus _PROTEIN_ raised the possibility that _PROTEIN_ might be localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to test more directly for the subnuclear location of _PROTEIN_ we made a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion construct and examined _METHOD_ distribution by optical sectioning with confocal microscopy . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was found to be localized to the _LOCATION_ and homogenously distributed throughout the interior of the _LOCATION_ compartment providing evidence against an exclusive _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ . in an initial attempt to localize the region of _PROTEIN_ that is responsible for _LOCATION_ localization we made four additional gus _PROTEIN_ constructs containing subdomains of _PROTEIN_ and performed semiquantitative analysis of fusion protein distribution . construct iii encompassing the n terminal domain of _PROTEIN_ with all of the predicted transmembrane helices was found to be predominantly in the _LOCATION_ . similarly construct iv representing the remaining c terminal domain lacking predicted transmembrane segments also displayed a distinct skewing toward _LOCATION_ localization compared with the full length _PROTEIN_ construct . because neither half of the molecule appeared to localize to the _LOCATION_ the data suggested that a critical component of the normal _LOCATION_ localization signal might have been disrupted by the partitioning of the molecule . consistent with this possibility constructs v and vi were both found to be primarily _LOCATION_ localized similar to the full length _PROTEIN_ . these results suggest that the region of _PROTEIN_ between residues and is sufficient for its _LOCATION_ localization . this region contains four separate clusters of basic amino acids similar to clusters established to function as _LOCATION_ localization signals in other proteins .
