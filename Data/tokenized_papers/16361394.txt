plants possess a single gene for the structurally related heterochromatin termed like _PROTEIN_ . we investigated the subnuclear localization binding properties and dynamics of _PROTEIN_ proteins in arabidopsis thaliana cells . transient _PROTEIN_ assays showed that tomato _PROTEIN_ fused to green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized to heterochromatic chromocenters and showed punctuated distribution within the _LOCATION_ tomato but not arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ was also localized within the nucleolus . mutations of aromatic cage residues that recognize methyl of histone abolished their punctuated distribution and localization to chromocenters . sl _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants displayed cell type dependent subnuclear localization . the diverse localization pattern of tomato _PROTEIN_ did not require the chromo shadow domain whereas the chromodomain alone was insufficient for localization to chromocenters a nucleolar localization signal was identified within the hinge region . _METHOD_ recovery after photobleaching showed that sl _PROTEIN_ is a highly mobile protein whose localization and retention are controlled by distinct domains retention at the nucleolus and chromocenters is conferred by the csd . our results imply that _PROTEIN_ recruitment to chromatin is mediated at least in part through interaction with methyl and that _PROTEIN_ controls different _LOCATION_ processes via transient binding to its _LOCATION_ sites .
the sl _PROTEIN_ gene encodes amino acids with a calculated molecular _METHOD_ of kd . the protein contains a cd and a csd which are characteristic features of the protein family . sl _PROTEIN_ shares high amino acid sequence similarity with arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ particularly within the cd and csd regions . we examined the ability of sl _PROTEIN_ to complement the _PROTEIN_ mutant . this mutant is a t dna insertion in the promoter region of the _PROTEIN_ gene which leads to a significant reduction in _PROTEIN_ transcription and consequently to altered leaf morphology and early flowering _PROTEIN_ mutants also display terminal flowers and alteration in _PROTEIN_ levels defense related secondary metabolites . sl _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ under the control of the promoter was introduced into _PROTEIN_ and several plants showing phenotypic complementation of _PROTEIN_ coupled with _PROTEIN_ of sl _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were isolated . analysis of progeny revealed cosegregation of the wild type phenotype with the _METHOD_ signal _METHOD_ positive phenotypically wild type progeny were cosegregated in a mendelian manner _PROTEIN_ . in these plants the sl _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene underwent strong silencing in subsequent generations reverting to the phenotype conferred by _PROTEIN_ . together our results support functional similarities between the arabidopsis and tomato _PROTEIN_ proteins . methylation is a key epigenetic mark controlling chromatin structure at least in part through the recruitment of proteins . glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ pull down assays have previously shown the capability of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ to bind methylated histone . we analyzed the ability of sl _PROTEIN_ to bind methylated isolated from tobacco leaves . primarily sl _PROTEIN_ was predicted to bind methylated through the cd because the aromatic cage residues that recognize methyl are conserved in sl _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ pull down assays were performed with glutathione sepharose containing _PROTEIN_ alone _PROTEIN_ sl _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cd and _PROTEIN_ csd . as shown in figure the tobacco leaf acid soluble fraction contained three polypeptides that reacted with anti . _PROTEIN_ sl _PROTEIN_ bound two of the three histone polypeptides an interaction that required the cd but not the csd . in addition histone methylated in vitro by was bound by _PROTEIN_ sl _PROTEIN_ but not by _PROTEIN_ alone . based on the ability of sl _PROTEIN_ to bind in vitro to methylated at we next investigated whether its subnuclear localization coincides with that of methylated . for subnuclear localization study of sl _PROTEIN_ we selected arabidopsis cells because of their high degree of resolution in analyzing subnuclear localization and the ease with which one can distinguish chromocenters in arabidopsis _LOCATION_ there are chromocenters most of which are positioned at the _LOCATION_ periphery . transient _PROTEIN_ into arabidopsis protoplasts showed a diversified distribution of sl _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in arabidopsis _LOCATION_ it was localized to several large spots at the _LOCATION_ periphery which are likely to be chromocenters enriched with dimethylated . however sl _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was also dispersed in a speckle like pattern within the _LOCATION_ and was found within the nucleolus a _LOCATION_ compartment engaged in the transcription of rrna genes . hence the subnuclear localization of sl _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis is not limited to sites known to be methylated at . notably the distribution of sl _PROTEIN_ at chromocenters was uneven as it tends to occupy the pericentromeric region leaving the center as a black hole . likewise sl _PROTEIN_ was localized at specific nucleolar compartments excluding sphere shaped sites which are reminiscent of fibrillar centers . for comparison we transiently _PROTEIN_ at _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis cells and found that its subnuclear localization generally resembled that of sl _PROTEIN_ except for its absence from the nucleolus . cells _PROTEIN_ at _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ displayed three types of localization punctuated chromocentric or both . localization at chromocenters was further demonstrated using a confocal microscope equipped with a laser diode system capable of diamidino phenylindole detection . as shown in figure both sl _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and at _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were colocalized to the intensely dapi stained chromocenters . mutations of aromatic cage residues _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ that recognize methyl abolished the punctuated distribution within the _LOCATION_ as well as the localization to chromocenters of both at _PROTEIN_ and sl _PROTEIN_ . in these assays the mutated form of sl _PROTEIN_ was localized almost exclusively to the nucleolus whereas that of at _PROTEIN_ was evenly dispersed within the _LOCATION_ implying that localization at these subnuclear domains is mediated through interaction with methylated of histone . sl _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background was localized exclusively to the _LOCATION_ showing different subnuclear distribution patterns in different cell types . in guard cells sl _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized to fewer large spots at the _LOCATION_ periphery and dispersed within the _LOCATION_ in a speckle like manner no localization was detected within the nucleolus . in trichomes having large endoreduplicated _LOCATION_ sl _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized within the nucleolus and dispersed unevenly within the _LOCATION_ localization to chromocenters could not be verified microscopically . in mesophyll cells sl _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was dispersed _PROTEIN_ in a speckle like manner throughout the _LOCATION_ . these localization patterns indicate the dynamic nature of sl _PROTEIN_ subnuclear distribution and its cell type dependence . localization of sl _PROTEIN_ at chromocenters was verified by _METHOD_ in situ hybridization assay . fixed _LOCATION_ were first immunolabeled with anti _METHOD_ followed by fish with tetramethylrhodamine dutp labeled centromeric repeats _PROTEIN_ . a small fraction of _LOCATION_ showed that sl _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was closely associated with _PROTEIN_ confirming localization at chromocenters . to examine the importance of dna and histone methylation for _PROTEIN_ subnuclear localization we transiently _PROTEIN_ sl _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and at _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in several mutants _PROTEIN_ a mutant in the chromatin remodeling gene _PROTEIN_ a mutant in the dna _PROTEIN_ gene kyp a mutant in the kryptonite methyltransferase _PROTEIN_ gene and _PROTEIN_ a mutant in a histone methyltransferase _PROTEIN_ gene whose mutation caused a strong reduction in histone methylation . although all of these mutants have reduced methylation _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ also display significant reductions in dna methylation . in all mutants examined the subnuclear localization of sl _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and at _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was similar to that of wild type cells . similarly mutations in the _PROTEIN_ domain genes medea and curly _PROTEIN_ did not affect the localization of sl _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to the various _LOCATION_ domains . to determine the sl _PROTEIN_ protein region responsible for its _LOCATION_ and subnuclear localization we divided the protein into several portions each fused with _METHOD_ at its c terminus . using psort ii software three putative _LOCATION_ localization signals were identified . is located at the cd and the other two are located at the hinge region a bipartite and . transient _PROTEIN_ into arabidopsis protoplasts showed that the localization of sl _PROTEIN_ containing all nlss but lacking the csd was indistinguishable from that of the intact protein . the c terminal part containing and the csd was evenly localized within the _LOCATION_ excluding the nucleolus . further analysis showed that the n terminal region containing was dispersed both in the cytoplasm and within the _LOCATION_ in a pattern similar to that displayed by _METHOD_ alone suggesting that the putative is nonfunctional . this was further supported by the behavior of the protein region containing the cd in which the _METHOD_ signal showed a distribution pattern similar to that of the n terminus . these results suggest that neither the cd alone nor the csd has site specific _LOCATION_ targeting properties . the protein portion containing the cd and was localized to the _LOCATION_ showing a preference for the nucleolus and to some extent to chromocenters but it failed to show the speckle like distribution within the _LOCATION_ . finally we showed that the region encompassing residues to retained the nucleolus targeting localization property and was also localized at fewer tiny yet unidentified _LOCATION_ bodies . together our results suggest that the protein portion between amino acids and corresponding to the bipartite possesses the nucleolar localization signal . to verify this prediction we next fused this portion with _METHOD_ and after transformation we analyzed its subnuclear distribution . the results clearly showed that this protein portion targeted the _METHOD_ signal almost exclusively to the nucleolus indicating its function as a nols . we next sought to identify the protein region responsible for sl _PROTEIN_ retention within the nucleolus and chromocenters using frap . in this assay physical interaction of sl _PROTEIN_ with _LOCATION_ proteins would lead to stable association and consequently to slower frap . the finding that sl _PROTEIN_ containing the csd but not other sl _PROTEIN_ truncated proteins retained the specific intranucleolar distribution pattern as the full length protein suggests that the csd stabilizes the association of the protein within the nucleolus . arabidopsis protoplasts transiently _PROTEIN_ full length sl _PROTEIN_ or its derivatives namely sl _PROTEIN_ sl _PROTEIN_ and sl _PROTEIN_ were bleached by high powered laser pulses in a rectangular area of the nucleolus . _METHOD_ recovery in the bleached area was monitored during a to s postbleaching period by sequential imaging scans . sl _PROTEIN_ behaved similarly to _METHOD_ alone that is it infiltrated the bleached area so fast that recovery was nearly complete during the time required to capture a single frame _METHOD_ . generally frap analysis showed that like animal proteins sl _PROTEIN_ is a highly mobile protein that binds transiently to its chromosomal sites . the sl _PROTEIN_ derivatives showed different rates of _METHOD_ recovery in the nucleolus sl _PROTEIN_ lacking the csd displayed a significantly faster mobility than either the full length sl _PROTEIN_ or sl _PROTEIN_ . this finding suggests that the csd functions in the positioning and stabilization of sl _PROTEIN_ within the nucleolus . likewise we found that the csd contributes to the stabilization of the sl _PROTEIN_ association with chromocenters . frap at chromocenters was faster when the csd was omitted _PROTEIN_ compared with full length sl _PROTEIN_ displaying recovery times of and s respectively . together our results suggest that the stable association of sl _PROTEIN_ with chromocenters and within the nucleolus is largely dependent on the csd .

_PROTEIN_ and at _PROTEIN_ s and two primers flanking the at _PROTEIN_ coding region s and as . the resulting two pcr fragments were mixed and subjected to pcr using s and as as primers . the amplified dna fragment was digested with bglii and smai and ligated into the same sites of _METHOD_ . all constructs were sequenced to ensure in frame fusion with the _METHOD_ and used for protoplast transformation experiments . to generate transgenic plants the sl _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fragment was excised out using ecori and subcloned into the same site of the binary vector ppzp to generate ppzp sl _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ followed by transformation into agrobacterium tumefaciens and into arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins were _PROTEIN_ and purified by glutathione sepharose essentially as described in the manufacturer 's protocol _PROTEIN_ except for the use of netn buffer instead of _PROTEIN_ . in vitro binding of sl _PROTEIN_ to histone was determined by the _PROTEIN_ pull down assay with glutathione sepharose containing various _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins as indicated in the figures and trichloroacetic acid soluble fraction from tobacco cells followed by immunoblotting with anti . in certain experiments _PROTEIN_ pull down assays were performed with calf thymus histones or with histone labeled with histone methyltransferase _PROTEIN_ in a reaction
