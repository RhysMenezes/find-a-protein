seed storage proteins protect seed against oxidative stress during seed ageing .
the germination ability of ar and year old seeds from four genotypes was investigated . the genotypes used are the arabidopsis background line ler and three near isogenic lines that contain introgression fragments of cvi an and sha accessions at the position of the earlier identified seed longevity qtl cvi an and sha respectively . upon storage all genotypes showed a significant reduction in germination percentage but with a different level of sensitivity to ageing . and had better seed longevity compared with ler whereas was less storable . these results confirmed the seed longevity phenotypes described by et al . . proteomic profiling for ar and aged seeds was performed to identify _METHOD_ and modifications associated with the loss of germination ability during seed dry storage . total soluble protein extracts were separated using _PROTEIN_ and seven pair wise comparisons were made . pair wise comparisons between the two physiological states for each genotype revealed protein spots that were affected by ageing . the three nils contain introgression fragments at different genome positions and exhibit different levels of seed longevity . the differences in seed longevity could result from proteome variation already present in the ar seeds which can be revealed by pair wise comparisons between the nils and ler . comparison with the ar ler seed proteome allowed the identification of and genotype specific protein spots for and respectively . some of these protein spots overlapped with the aged versus ar comparison . a total of differentially accumulated protein spots were detected in the seven pair wise comparisons . principal component analysis on the protein spots separated the samples into two groups which represented the two physiological states . the time component accounted for of the variation and the genotype component explained . was the most distinct genotype and separation of its aged seeds in the pca might reflect its better longevity on the time component . is the least storable genotype . the aged versus ar physiological state comparisons for the four genotypes showed a total of protein spots whose abundance changed significantly upon ageing . a large number of the spots were genotype specific . the three genotype comparisons led to the identification of altered protein spots of which most were unique to the genotypes . the four spots in common between and when compared with ler at the ar state might play a role in seed longevity because both genotypes are more storable than ler . gel separation of seed proteins and the effect of ageing on seed protein abundance . gel of total soluble proteins from dry seeds stained with silver nitrate . the areas indicated on the gel are enlarged in panels b

the relative abundance of the spots in both types of comparisons is indicated . positive fold changes indicate higher abundances and negative lower abundances . spots in bold exhibit seed longevity up or seed longevity down protein profile . fold changes in bold indicate statistically significant changes . _PROTEIN_ . spots that were identified based on comparison to the reference protein map are labelled with r . n.i. not identified . principal component analysis for proteome profiles of ler and the near isogenic lines and . pca was performed on the differentially accumulated protein spots in the seven comparisons . classification of differentially _PROTEIN_ protein spots . intersection of proteins that were differentially _PROTEIN_ between the two physiological states aged versus after ripened within landsberg _LOCATION_ and the near isogenic lines or . intersection of proteins that were differentially _PROTEIN_ between genotypes each nil versus ler . intersection of proteins that were differential _PROTEIN_ in the genotypes and respectively in the earlier comparisons . genotype specific protein spots include those differentially _PROTEIN_ in only one genotype derived from physiological comparisons and those identified in genotype comparisons . overlapping spots of both comparison types are presented in and . generally these results indicate that seed dry storage affects the proteome in a genotype specific manner . furthermore since the nils used in this study possess different introgressed genomic regions at seed longevity qtls several distinct pathways might be involved in seed ageing which could be manifested as unique elements in their respective seed proteomes . these differences can either be causes or consequences of ageing and one can not exclude the differences in the ar seed proteomes are caused by the nature of the introgression in the nils and are therefore unrelated to seed longevity . to identify the _PROTEIN_ underlying the protein differences both reference mapping and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis was performed . approximately of the differentially accumulated protein spots could be identified . seed proteins are targets of various modifications including _PROTEIN_ and s nitrosylation especially in dry storage . as a consequence of these modifications proteins can be represented by several _METHOD_ with different molecular weight and/or isoelectric point . thus multiple spots of the same protein were identified . investigation of the identified proteins in the four genotypes ler and revealed that possible diverse genetic pathways are involved in seed longevity which is reflected by proteins for which the _METHOD_ are significantly altered in abundance in a genotype specific manner . is the most storable line of the four tested genotypes . has unique protein spots that accumulate differently in aged compared to ar seeds and when comparing ar seeds of to that of ler . eight spots were at the intersect of both comparison types for of which two and contained crub . carries the truncated crub cvi allele resulting in a crub subunit with a lower mw compared to that from the ler allele which might account for the identification of crub in . dry seeds are well equipped to confront oxidative stress during storage due to their low water content and reduced metabolic activity . auto oxidation leading to accumulation of ros occurs in dry seed where proteins are the major targets of oxidative damage because of their abundance and high affinity with radicals . to control ros induced damage seeds have detoxification _METHOD_ to scavenge or inactivate ros . we found two proteins that are involved in the ascorbate antioxidant metabolism pathway in . protein spot corresponds to monodehydroascobate _PROTEIN_ a well known antioxidant enzyme that removes hydrogen peroxide at the ascorbate glutathione cycle . t dna insertion mutant analysis for seed longevity showed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ did not differ in seed longevity compared to col . the lack of a phenotype might be due to redundancy since the mdar gene family contains five members . over _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in tobacco conferred enhanced tolerance to ozone salt and osmotic stresses suggesting that the ascorbate glutathione cycle may play a role in seed ageing . gdp d _PROTEIN_ epimerase _PROTEIN_ is a key enzyme involved in ascorbate synthesis in plants . ar seeds had higher levels of _PROTEIN_ which likely explains the higher resistance to ageing of compared to ler seeds . the _PROTEIN_ isoform was found more abundant in aged than ar seeds which could indicate _PROTEIN_ modification during ageing . homozygous _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion lines could not be isolated indicating that _PROTEIN_ is an essential protein . receptor for activated c _PROTEIN_ isoform was more abundant in ar seeds of than that of ler which might also contribute to the better seed longevity of this nil . _PROTEIN_ is a multi function protein that plays a regulatory role in diverse signal transduction pathways and its transcripts are present during seed germination . in arabidopsis the translation initiation _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ a negative regulator of aba response and positive regulator of ga signalling . it was demonstrated that aba inhibited _PROTEIN_ and gene _PROTEIN_ . thus seed germination of a _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion line was examined however did not significantly differ from that of wild type col . the second most storable genotype had unique protein spots that differentially accumulated when aged and ar seeds were compared and when ar seeds of were compared to that of ler . two spots were common in both comparisons . although no specific pathway was identified there are interesting proteins that might be involved in seed longevity in this nil . spot corresponds to the t complex protein subunit _PROTEIN_ . several members of the _PROTEIN_ protein family were described to be up accumulated during arabidopsis seed dormancy release suggesting that they could play a central role in seed germination . responsive to _PROTEIN_ was identified in two protein spots and . the increased level of _PROTEIN_ could be a marker for increased seed longevity . it was noted that de novo transcription is not required for germination since seeds are able to germinate until radical protrusion in the presence of amanitin _PROTEIN_ however subsequent seedling growth was prevented . newly synthesized transcripts might also be necessary for germination of aged seed . the low abundance of rna _PROTEIN_ ii _PROTEIN_ fold less abundant after ageing of seeds may contribute to reduced seed germination after storage . homozygous t dna insertion lines for rna _PROTEIN_ ii could not be isolated . is the most sensitive genotype to ageing in this study . the reduced seed longevity in is caused by the _PROTEIN_ cvi allele as was revealed by complementation cloning . _PROTEIN_ protein accumulates during seed maturation and remains stable throughout seed storage however it is modified during after ripening . we did not identify _PROTEIN_ likely because it is rather stable and not modified anymore at _PROTEIN_ stages during dry storage . had unique protein spots that differentially accumulated when aged and ar seeds were compared and when ar seeds of were compared to that of ler . two spots and encoding elongation _PROTEIN_ and an unknown protein were common to both comparisons . one of the proteins differentially accumulating in is radiation _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ its protein spot is down regulated compared to ler . _PROTEIN_ was suggested to participate in dna damage repair since the two carrot _METHOD_ rescue the uv sensitive phenotype of the deletion mutant in yeast . during storage seeds are subjected to dna damage and genome instability which are considered to be a _PROTEIN_ cause of reduced germination after ageing . the _PROTEIN_ of a functional dna repair complex is essential for long term survival . however since _PROTEIN_ is located in the introgression region of we can not exclude the possibility that it affects seed longevity independently from _PROTEIN_ . another group of differentially accumulating proteins are the identified _PROTEIN_ embryogenesis abundant family proteins _PROTEIN_ in spot and _PROTEIN_ in spot and . the association of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and seed germination after ageing was examined by t dna insertion mutant analysis however the lea mutant exhibited similar seed longevity compared to col . nadp _PROTEIN_ malic in spot was lower abundant in aged compared with ar seeds of which makes it a possible marker for seed longevity . _PROTEIN_ one of the five albumin or napin _METHOD_ was more abundant in aged . the _PROTEIN_ protein spot might be a degradation product due to its altered mw and pi . to examine if napins could affect seed longevity a napin rnai line was analysed for seed longevity . the line which is depleted of napins and has a reduced protein content _PROTEIN_ in the endosperm was more sensitive to ageing than wild type col . the effect of seed storage proteins _PROTEIN_ on seed longevity and seed dormancy . seed longevity presented as germination of different _PROTEIN_ knock out lines was measured after d of artificial ageing . the lines include the wild type col as well as single double and triple knock out lines of cruciferins and an rnai napin line that is depleted of napins . seed dormancy presented as days of seed dry storage required to reach germination of col and different _PROTEIN_ knock out lines . _PROTEIN_ metabolism is important for germinating seeds since it provides energy and intermediate metabolites for seed germination and seedling establishment . the metabolic pathways related to energy production are glycolysis the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway fermentation the tricarboxylic acid cycle the glyoxylate cycle and the electron transport chain . the abundance of several protein _METHOD_ that encode for enzymes in these pathways were altered in the seed proteome upon storage . similar changes in the seed proteome upon ageing has also been found previously . in order to investigate the importance of these enzymes for seed longevity we have investigated t dna insertion lines of these genes for their seed longevity behaviour . the list of t dna insertion mutants that was tested is provided in supplementary table . for none of the mutants investigated seed longevity phenotypes have been revealed . it is possible that these enzymes are not important for seed longevity however we expect that the lack of phenotypes are caused by gene redundancy . for example for the glycolysis enzyme udp _PROTEIN_ uridylyltransferase _PROTEIN_ we could only obtain one homozygous mutant _PROTEIN_ and this mutant did not show a seed longevity phenotype however there are two _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis and these likely act redundantly . differentially _PROTEIN_ protein spots upon ageing that are related to translation energy metabolism reactivation of cell activity redox homeostasis and aba signalling the table displays protein spots based on the seven comparisons . spot id the gene corresponding to the protein underlying the spot molecular weight and the theoretical and experimental isoelectric point are presented respectively . furthermore the relative abundance of the spots in both types of comparisons is indicated . positive fold changes indicate higher abundances and negative lower abundances . fold changes in bold indicate the statistically significant changes . _PROTEIN_ . spots that were identified based on comparison to the reference protein map are labelled with r . n.i. not available . protein translation is essential for seed germination since the presence of the translation inhibitor cycloheximide prevented radicle protrusion . furthermore aged seeds were strongly affected in their translation capacity . this research also demonstrated that many proteins involved in protein metabolism were highly _PROTEIN_ in deteriorated seeds . consistent with previous studies we observed that the levels of elongation _PROTEIN_ family proteins were lower in aged compared to ar seeds . moreover spot corresponding to the ribosomal protein subunit _PROTEIN_ was reduced in abundance after storage of ler and seeds . changes in the abundance of methionine adenosyltransferase were observed in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ after ageing . mat participates in s adenosylmethionine biosynthesis and is important for reactivating cellular activity in germinating seeds . this indicates genotype specific differences in the dependency on pathways related to ado met metabolism in seed longevity . seed storage and germination are coupled to extensive changes in the redox state of seed proteins and even in the dry state seed proteins are subjected to various types of _METHOD_ which include redox modifications . thioredoxin has a vital role in redox processes in which it _METHOD_ essential proteins from the oxidized to the reduced form and in the process retrieves the molecular function of those proteins . thioredoxin _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ abundance declined in aged compared to ar seeds of ler . _PROTEIN_ is a thioredoxin dependent peroxidases type ii b one of the six _METHOD_ in this family which has a wide range of redox buffering activities . thus _PROTEIN_ might be very important for retaining the redox balance during ageing and germination . to investigate the role of _PROTEIN_ seed longevity for the _PROTEIN_ mutant was analysed however it was similar to the wild type col accession . the lack of a visible phenotype for _PROTEIN_ could be due to the nature of the t dna insertion or due to redundancy of enzymatic antioxidant _METHOD_ in seeds so that missing one might not have obvious effects . vitamin e is another antioxidant important for seed longevity since the vitamin e _PROTEIN_ mutant seeds were more sensitive to artificial ageing than those of the wild type . in this study _PROTEIN_ abundance was lower in aged seeds of and than ar seeds which is in agreement with previous studies suggesting a role of _PROTEIN_ in seed longevity . many of the identified protein spots were _PROTEIN_ globulin fragments a predominant type of _PROTEIN_ referred to as cruciferin . a set of single double and triple knock out lines for crua crub and cruc was analysed to study the role of cruciferins in seed longevity under artificial ageing . cruciferin single knock out mutants lacking one of the cruciferin _METHOD_ did not differ in seed longevity compared to wild type col . the crua cruc double mutant lacking both crua and cruc exhibited reduced seed longevity whereas seed longevity for the crua crub and crub cruc double mutants was unaffected . crub is poorly transcribed and crub is the least abundant cruciferin isoform thus the crua cruc double mutant has very low levels of cruciferin . this explains why double mutants that have eliminated crub but retained the more abundant crua or cruc _METHOD_ did not show reduced seed longevity . the effect of cruciferin content on seed longevity was even more apparent in the crua crub cruc triple mutant which was very sensitive to artificial ageing . the role of cruciferins on seed longevity can not be explained by reduced protein levels since the crua cruc double mutant has wild type protein levels in both the endosperm and the embryo . this phenomenon is referred to as seed proteome rebalancing and involves a general increase in the production of other seed proteins to compensate for the loss of a major _PROTEIN_ . defects in seed development that lead to reduced seed longevity often result in reduced seed dormancy levels as well examples are the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and tt mutants . however despite the reduction in _PROTEIN_ and reduced seed longevity seed dormancy as measured by days of seed dry storage required to reach germination was unaffected in the cru mutants . thus the loss of germination in the mutant is not caused by the lack of protein reserves . it is possible that the localization and distribution of the proteins is important since the crua crub cruc triple mutant contains very small protein storage vesicles with very little protein within . the influences of _PROTEIN_ can also be due to their modification because _PROTEIN_ are subject to a wide range of _METHOD_ suggesting that the effects of _METHOD_ on _PROTEIN_ play a role in seed longevity . although several t dna mutants were tested for seed longevity _PROTEIN_ mutants showed the most severe phenotype especially the cruciferin triple mutant crua crub cruc and the napin rnai line . therefore we further investigated the seed longevity mechanism provided by _PROTEIN_ using these two mutants . _PROTEIN_ were reported to be _METHOD_ oxidized especially in the form of _PROTEIN_ during seed germination in arabidopsis and in pea . different roles for _PROTEIN_ in seed germination have been proposed due to its affinity to _PROTEIN_ role in reserve mobilization . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are easily destabilized from larger complexes since they are more susceptible to proteolysis to remobilize resources for seed germination and seedling establishment . it was also suggested that the abundance of _PROTEIN_ makes them an efficient scavenging system for ros that are actively generated during seed germination . during long term storage _PROTEIN_ are often _PROTEIN_ which is an irreversible form of oxidation leading to deterioration in dry aged seeds of arabidopsis and beech . the high abundance of _PROTEIN_ might protect other proteins that are important for germination from oxidation suggesting a role for _PROTEIN_ in ros buffering during seed dry storage . we examined this hypothesis by investigation of the _PROTEIN_ pattern of ar and aged _PROTEIN_ mutant seeds in comparison with that of wild type seeds . _PROTEIN_ analysis of total protein extracts confirmed the reduction of cruciferin and napin proteins in dry seeds of the crua crub cruc and rnai napin mutant respectively . _PROTEIN_ of seed proteins was significant in both ar and aged seeds with cruciferin being a major target in the wild type and rnai napin lines . the cruciferin mutant exhibited a different protein _PROTEIN_ pattern in which _PROTEIN_ levels increased for the remaining proteins compared to the wild type profile . in addition there is a slight reduction in protein oxidation profiles comparing aged to ar seeds of all three genotypes but also this effect was the strongest in the crua crub cruc mutant . our result provides the first proof that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cruciferins are buffers for oxidative stress especially in dry seeds during storage . the _PROTEIN_ proteins in _PROTEIN_ mutants are interesting since they will reveal new insights on the elements important for seed longevity . protein _PROTEIN_ of seed proteins in after ripened artificially aged seeds . gel electrophoresis stained with
