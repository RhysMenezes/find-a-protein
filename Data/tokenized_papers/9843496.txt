the molecular _METHOD_ underlying gravity perception and signal transduction which control asymmetric plant growth responses are as yet unknown but are likely to depend on the directional flux of the plant hormone auxin . we have isolated an arabidopsis mutant of the _PROTEIN_ gene using transposon mutagenesis . roots of the _PROTEIN_ were agravitropic and showed altered auxin sensitivity a phenotype characteristic of the agravitropic _PROTEIN_ mutant . the _PROTEIN_ gene was mapped to chromosome corresponding to the _PROTEIN_ locus and subsequent genetic analysis indicated that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were allelic . the _PROTEIN_ gene consists of nine exons defining an open reading frame of bp which encodes a kda protein with putative transmembrane domains interrupted by a central hydrophilic loop . the topology of _PROTEIN_ was found to be similar to members of the major facilitator superfamily of transport proteins . we have shown that the _PROTEIN_ gene was _PROTEIN_ in root tips . the _PROTEIN_ protein was localized in _LOCATION_ of root cortical and epidermal cells in the meristematic and elongation zones revealing a _PROTEIN_ localization . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ plays an important role in control of gravitropism regulating the redistribution of auxin from the stele towards the elongation zone of roots .
the _PROTEIN_ gene and the corresponding cdna were isolated using a probe derived from the _PROTEIN_ gene which is involved in the control of _PROTEIN_ auxin transport in arabidopsis plants . a genomic clone was obtained spanning a region of kb . screening of several cdna libraries resulted only in truncated _PROTEIN_ cdnas . therefore we reconstructed a cdna clone by pcr amplification of bp from the genomic clone and ligation of this pcr fragment to the end of an incomplete cdna . sequence comparison of the genomic clone with the cdna showed that the coding sequence of the _PROTEIN_ gene was interrupted by eight introns . several stop codons upstream of the coding region of bp and polyadenylation signals located at cdna positions and indicated that the cdna contained the full coding region . in addition the sequence around the initiation codon confirmed kozak 's rules . to determine the map position of the _PROTEIN_ gene we hybridized the cic yac library with an _PROTEIN_ probe and identified a yac contig consisting of and located in the region of cm and cm on the lower arm of arabidopsis chromosome . the _PROTEIN_ gene encodes a protein of amino acids with a predicted molecular _METHOD_ of kda . the predicted _PROTEIN_ protein sequence consisted of > hydrophobic amino acids yielding a calculated isoelectric point of and a net charge of at ph . the protein showed high similarity to the _PROTEIN_ protein and to other members of the _PROTEIN_ gene family . hydropathy analysis revealed three characteristic regions a hydrophobic region with five to six transmembrane segments a predominantly hydrophilic core extending from residue to which was followed by another hydrophobic region with about four to five transmembrane segments between residues and . the position of the transmembrane segments was equally detected by _METHOD_ psort predictprotein tmpred and peptidestructure . psort data suggested at a probability of that _PROTEIN_ was a _LOCATION_ protein anchored through internal sequences in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . for functional analysis of the _PROTEIN_ gene we screened for a mutant in a collection of arabidopsis plants mutagenized by the maize transposon . we identified a mutant _PROTEIN_ in which the transposon was inserted into the second exon of the _PROTEIN_ gene thereby disrupting the codon for . to characterize the _PROTEIN_ mutant with respect to growth of aerial and root organs homozygous progeny were grown on agar plates . roots of mutant plants displayed an agravitropic phenotype coupled to reduced root elongation growth . physical mapping revealed that the chromosomal position of _PROTEIN_ corresponded to the _PROTEIN_ locus . since the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mutant exhibited a similar agravitropic phenotype as _PROTEIN_ we performed crosses between the homozygous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants to test for allelism . analysis of the progeny indeed showed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were allelic . we have tested the auxin sensitivity of root elongation for the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ alleles since several agravitropic mutants have been observed to exhibit altered auxin response . seeds were first germinated on murashige and skoog _METHOD_ agar medium then transfered onto _METHOD_ agar plates containing various concentrations of acid acid or acid . additional root growth following transfer was measured after days and the percentage of root elongation was calculated relative to growth on media containing no auxin . the results revealed that elongation of _PROTEIN_ mutant roots was more sensitive than at elevated concentrations of and iaa but no difference in sensitivity was found between them . similar responses have been observed for the _PROTEIN_ allele . the greater sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant roots towards the auxins > iaa > is consistent with the known substrate specificity of the auxin efflux carrier . northern blot analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in young seedlings and roots of plants grown on agar and in liquid culture respectively . this was confirmed by western blot analyses using polyclonal antibodies raised against a polypeptide extending from residues of _PROTEIN_ . the antibodies detected a specific signal corresponding to the expected size of kda in _LOCATION_ fractions of arabidopsis roots . in order to localize _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the spatial distribution of its mrna was determined by in situ hybridization using seedlings . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was observed in a region spanning meristematic and distal elongation zones of seedlings whereas no signals were detected in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . to localize the _PROTEIN_ protein within root cells in situ immunostaining analysis of seedlings was performed using affinity purified primary antibodies with fluorescein isothiocyanate secondary antibodies . immunohistochemical staining of plants revealed _PROTEIN_ signals in a region spanning meristematic and distal elongation zones consistent with the _PROTEIN_ mrna in situ hybridization results . in roots of homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant plants we observed only diffuse background staining as expected for a mutant . in seedlings the _PROTEIN_ fitc _METHOD_ was localized exclusively in _LOCATION_ of root cortical and epidermal cell files starting three to five cells distant from the quiescent center . no signal was observed in the stele pericycle or endodermis . the _METHOD_ was very weak if not completely absent at the periclinal side of cortical cells contacting the endodermal cells . stronger signals were observed at the and periclinal sides of cortical cells adjacent to other cortical and epidermal cells . in the epidermal cell file _PROTEIN_ was preferentially localized to the anticlinal side of the cells . as the epidermal cell file extended towards the elongation zone the signal was present at the basal side of cells oriented towards the elongation zone . this striking cellular _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is highly reminiscent of the basal localization of the homologous _PROTEIN_ protein in arabidopsis inflorescence axes . this common basal localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins in different cells is consistent with the proposed direction of auxin flux in each of these tissues .
