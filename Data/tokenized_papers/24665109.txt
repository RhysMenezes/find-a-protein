in arabidopsis thaliana the degree of methylesterification of homogalacturonans the _PROTEIN_ pectic constituent of the cell wall can be modified by pectin methylesterases . in all _METHOD_ two types of protein structure have been reported for pmes group and group . in group pmes the active part is preceded by an n terminal extension which shows similarities to pme inhibitors . this pro part mediates retention of unprocessed group pmes in the _LOCATION_ apparatus thus regulating pme activity through a post translational mechanism . this study investigated the roles of a subtilisin type serine protease in the processing of a pme isoform . using a combination of functional genomics biochemistry and proteomic approaches the role of a specific sbt in the processing of a group pme was assessed together with its consequences for plant development . a group pme _PROTEIN_ was identified which was highly co _PROTEIN_ both spatially and temporally with _PROTEIN_ a subtilisin type serine protease during root development . pme activity was modified in roots of knockout mutants for both proteins with consequent effects on root growth . this suggested a role for _PROTEIN_ in the processing of _PROTEIN_ in planta . using transient _PROTEIN_ in nicotiana benthamiana it was indeed shown that _PROTEIN_ can process _PROTEIN_ at a specific single processing motif releasing a mature isoform in the apoplasm . by revealing the potential role of _PROTEIN_ in the processing of _PROTEIN_ this study brings new evidence of the complexity of the regulation of pmes in plants and highlights the need for identifying specific pme sbt pairs .
to identify putative pme sbt pairs we used the _PROTEIN_ angler tool of the bio analytic resource for plant biology and _PROTEIN_ as the query . among the top ten genes that were found to be co _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ranked number one with an r value of . other genes on this list included amino acids biosynthesis related and response to stress related genes . other sbts and other cell wall related genes were potentially co _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ but with much lower r value . to confirm _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ co _PROTEIN_ we first used rt qpcr to measure the relative _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in various organs and developmental stages _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ of arabidopsis col . as compared with stably _PROTEIN_ reference genes the relative _PROTEIN_ of both genes followed the same trend in all organs and developmental stages tested except for flower buds and mature seeds where _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ at very low levels while _PROTEIN_ was strongly _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ of both genes was particularly high in roots of plants grown in vitro . to localize the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ approx . kb of their promoters was pcr amplified and cloned upstream of a gus coding sequence . following plant transformation gus staining was visualized in light grown seedlings during development . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ promoters were particularly active in roots from d after germination onwards . our results show that the activities of the promoters were overlapping in particular in the root hair zone in _PROTEIN_ roots and in the root outer cell layer . while _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ promoter activities were higher in primary roots than _PROTEIN_ roots no apparent activity was detected in the central cylinder of the roots . analysis of sequences revealed that specific transcription _PROTEIN_ binding sites were conserved when comparing the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ promoters including putative dna binding sites for arf _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ . these transcription _PROTEIN_ are known to regulate the _PROTEIN_ of genes involved in control of cell wall modifications and plant development . proteins from d old roots and cell wall enriched extracts isolated from ws col _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were resolved by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and identified using lc _METHOD_ orbitrap analyses . thirty proteins that are potentially involved in hg modifications were identified in these extracts including _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the analysis further revealed specific peptides mapping _PROTEIN_ ranging from amino acids to resulting in coverage of the predicted pme domain . in contrast no peptide mapping the putative pmei domain was detected . fourteen peptides ranging from amino acids to were identified for _PROTEIN_ covering of the sequence of the mature protease lacking sp and prodomain . peptides were identified within the subtilase domain the protease associated _PROTEIN_ domain as well as in the fibronectin iii domain including the extreme c terminus . this suggests that _PROTEIN_ in contrast to for example cucumisin is only processed at the n terminus of the protein . this is consistent with the reported relevance of the fn iii domain and the c terminus for secretion and the stability of sbts and appears to be a common feature of arabidopsis sbts given that for the majority of sbts retrieved in our study peptides mapping the c terminal fn iii domain of the protein were identified . after sequence comparisons the tomato subtilase was used as a template for the structural modelling of the _PROTEIN_ isoform . _PROTEIN_ showed the same overall structural organization as with _METHOD_ tm score for the modelled monomer and _METHOD_ tm score for the homodimer respectively . two t dna insertion lines were identified for both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the insertions were localized in the first exon and in the intron for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . for _PROTEIN_ the insertions were localized in the first and second intron for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . pcr on d old root cdnas confirmed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as true ko lines while _PROTEIN_ was a knock down line which displayed as assessed by qpcr fold reduction of target gene _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type . levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts were further measured in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant backgrounds showing that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was significantly increased in the two _PROTEIN_ mutant alleles . in parallel _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were increased by twofold in _PROTEIN_ mutants . apparently the plant compensates for the loss of _PROTEIN_ function by overexpressing _PROTEIN_ and vice versa which will need to be further investigated . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were also confirmed as ko mutants by proteomic analysis which did not detect any _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ derived peptides in d old root cell wall enriched protein extracts in mutants compared with respective wild types . interestingly peptides matching the mature part of _PROTEIN_ were identified in _PROTEIN_ suggesting that other root sbts could compensate for the lack of _PROTEIN_ and thus process _PROTEIN_ into a mature active protein . in addition peptides mapping to several other cell wall proteins _PROTEIN_ were identified in roots of wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and some of these proteins appear to be differentially _PROTEIN_ in wild type and mutant contexts . this included _GENE_ for which peptides were identified in _PROTEIN_ but not in the corresponding wild type roots . peptides mapping _GENE_ and _GENE_ were identified in _PROTEIN_ but not in the corresponding wild type . in contrast peptides mapping and _GENE_ were identified in ws but not in _PROTEIN_ . these observations indicate that mutations in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have consequences that go far beyond the sole extinction of the genes of interest and these indirect effects may contribute to some of the phenotypes observed in the mutants . the defects in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lead to transient delay in germination at h which was unlikely to be related to changes in the release and structure of seed coat mucilage and a small but significant increase in the length of the primary root after d of culture . averages of and increase in root length over the wild type were observed for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants respectively . the results were similar for both mutant alleles with a more marked effect for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . thus we further investigated the consequences of the mutations on pme activity and cell wall structure in these two lines . using similar protein extraction procedures as described for proteomic analysis we measured total pme activity in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ roots . a significant and _PROTEIN_ in total pme activity was observed for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . the loss of _PROTEIN_ function could thus impair the processing of root _PROTEIN_ pmes with consequent effects on the production of mature active _METHOD_ . the _PROTEIN_ in total pme activity was related at least for _PROTEIN_ to a _PROTEIN_ in the activity of a pme isoform revealed by ief . in contrast no apparent changes in the balance between the activities of pme _METHOD_ could be observed when comparing _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants . in accordance with proteomic analysis this showed that _PROTEIN_ was effectively processed in _PROTEIN_ by root _PROTEIN_ sbts which could potentially compensate for the disappearance of _PROTEIN_ . together with in silico analysis these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ could be part of a pool of basic pme _METHOD_ which also includes the previously identified _PROTEIN_ . to investigate whether the _PROTEIN_ in total pme activity in the _PROTEIN_ mutant could be related to changes in the _PROTEIN_ of some other pme and pmei genes the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and was assessed by rt qpcr in d old roots . these five genes were previously reported to be _PROTEIN_ in roots and to play a role in pectin modifications during development . our results showed that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was significantly down regulated and that of up regulated in the _PROTEIN_ mutant compared with the wild type . next we assessed the consequences of the mutations in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ on root cell wall structure using _PROTEIN_ ir microspectroscopy at the site of the _PROTEIN_ promoter activities in the root hair zone . a strong and highly significant increase in absorbance at cm the wavenumber assigned to one pattern of ester linkages was observed for _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type . similar results were observed for _PROTEIN_ . a higher abundance of ester linkages is in accordance with the observed _PROTEIN_ in total pme activity in the mutant and _METHOD_ the biochemical activity of _PROTEIN_ . significant differences in absorbance were also observed for other wavenumbers . in particular a _PROTEIN_ in the absorbance for wavenumbers corresponding to amide bonds cellulose xyloglucan pectin and _PROTEIN_ of the pectin ester group was observed in _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type . in contrast the absorbance for wavenumbers corresponding to the polysaccharide fingerprint of cellulose xyloglucan and pectin glycosidic link were significantly increased in _PROTEIN_ compared with wild type . this suggests that alteration of pme activity had consequent effects on other cell wall polymers . although _PROTEIN_ ir spectra for the _PROTEIN_ mutants showed no overall drastic changes a significant _PROTEIN_ in the absorbance for wavenumber cm was observed in the _PROTEIN_ mutants . this wavenumber could correspond to a distinct pattern of methylester as chemical environment surrounding methylesters in the cell wall could lead to a shift of absorbances . although the changes observed between wild type and mutant for this specific wavenumber were similar for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the lack of strong differences in the absorbance for cm in _PROTEIN_ suggests potential compensatory effects within the sbt gene family . to assess if _PROTEIN_ can indeed process full length _PROTEIN_ and mediate the release of the pme domain into the apoplasm transient co _PROTEIN_ experiments were performed in n. benthamiana followed by apoplastic protein extraction and western blotting . for this _PROTEIN_ constructs for a c terminally myc tagged version of _PROTEIN_ were agro infiltrated in tobacco leaves with _PROTEIN_ in the presence or absence of and sbt inhibitors belonging to the kazal family of serine protease inhibitors . following apoplastic washes equal amounts of extracted proteins were resolved by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transferred to nitrocellulose _LOCATION_ and probed with anti c myc antibodies . in the absence of _PROTEIN_ two bands in a molecular _METHOD_ range of kda were detected in the apoplasm . this suggests that even though a single rkll sequence was identified two processing motifs could be present in the _PROTEIN_ amino acid sequence both of which are cleaved by an endogenous tobacco subtilase/protease . an additional band at a molecular _METHOD_ close to kda probably represents the non processed form of _PROTEIN_ . the recovery of this non processed form in apoplastic washes is likely to be explained by a slight contamination with _LOCATION_ content as measured through an mannosidase enzymatic assay . when _PROTEIN_ was co infiltrated with _PROTEIN_ the larger band disappeared suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is cleaved by _PROTEIN_ at at least one of the two processing sites probably the rkll motif . an additional lower band was detected that could indicate the presence of n terminal degradation products of _PROTEIN_ . in the presence of the sbt inhibitor epi no difference in the processing of _PROTEIN_ was revealed . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is able to process _PROTEIN_ and because both proteins are co _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis roots where they are co targeted to the secretory pathway and apoplasm they support a role for _PROTEIN_ in the maturation and regulation of _PROTEIN_ in vivo .
