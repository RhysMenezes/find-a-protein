_PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a nac like gene was identified in arabidopsis . in aif gus flowers _PROTEIN_ activity was detected in the anther the upper parts of the filaments and in the pollen of stage young flower buds gus activity was reduced in mature flowers . yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ aif c fusion proteins which lacked a transmembrane domain accumulated in the _LOCATION_ of the arabidopsis cells whereas the _METHOD_ aif fusion proteins accumulated in the _LOCATION_ and were absent in the _LOCATION_ . further detection of a cleaved aif protein in flowers revealed that aif needs to be processed and released from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in order to function . the ectopic _PROTEIN_ of aif c caused a male sterile phenotype with indehiscent anthers throughout flower development in arabidopsis . the presence of a repressor domain in aif and the similar phenotype of indehiscent anthers in aif c _PROTEIN_ plants suggest that aif acts as a repressor . the defect in anther dehiscence was due to the down regulation of genes that participate in jasmonic acid biosynthesis such as _PROTEIN_ . the external application of ja rescued the anther indehiscence in aif c and aif c _PROTEIN_ flowers . in aif c plants which are transgenic dominant negative mutants in which aif is converted to a potent activator via fusion to a ad motif the anther dehiscence was promoted and the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was up regulated . furthermore the suppression of aif through an antisense strategy resulted in a mutant phenotype similar to that observed in the aif c flowers . the present data suggest a role for aif in controlling anther dehiscence by suppressing the _PROTEIN_ of ja biosynthesis genes in arabidopsis .
one arabidopsis nac like gene _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was cloned and analysed . aif contains six exons and five introns and encodes a protein of amino acids . the aif protein contains a conserved nac domain with the five putative subdomains that have been identified in the n termini of most nac like proteins . when the sequence of the aif protein was further analysed a conserved nac repression domain which represses transcriptional activation was identified in the end of the nac domain . the aif protein showed identity and similarity to the most closely related nac like protein . in their nac domains of the amino acids are identical . the protein structure of aif . the aif protein contains a conserved nac domain in the n terminus a conserved nard domain for the repression of transcriptional activation in the end of the nac domain and a transmembrane domain in the c terminus of the protein . in aif c the tm was deleted . in aif c _PROTEIN_ an _PROTEIN_ domain that contained the amino acid repressor sequence _PROTEIN_ was fused to aif c. in aif c an activation domain ad which included the amino acid activation sequence _PROTEIN_ was fused to aif c. the conserved nard domain identified in aif and several other nac like proteins . to investigate the _PROTEIN_ pattern of the aif gene a construct was generated and transformed into arabidopsis and > independent aif gus plants were obtained . in the aif gus transgenic seedlings and plants gus staining was only detected in the primordia of the emerged true leaves and was absent in the mature leaves . during flower development gus activity was not detected before stage of flower budding . strong gus activity was detected only in the anthers and the upper parts of the stamen filaments after stage of flower budding . in stage flower buds gus activity in the filaments was absent but was continually detected in the anthers and pollen grains . the gus activity in the anthers and pollen grains was greatly diminished in mature flowers after stage . the specification of the flower developmental stages was as described by et al . . the pattern of gus _PROTEIN_ during stamen development that was obtained in this study was in agreement with the arabidopsis _METHOD_ browser data _METHOD_ _METHOD_ which report that aif is detected in the stamens of young flowers and is barely _PROTEIN_ in mature flowers . gus staining patterns in aif gus transgenic arabidopsis . gus activity was specifically detected in the anthers of aif gus floral buds and was absent in the young floral buds before stages . the number indicates the stage of flower development . close up of young floral buds at stages . gus activity started to be detected in anthers of floral buds at stage and was strongly _PROTEIN_ at stages . gus was absent in the young floral buds before stages . the corresponding young floral buds at stages in are indicated by dashed circles . close up of a floral bud at stage . strong gus activity was detected only in anthers and in the upper parts of filaments . close up of a floral bud and anther at stage . strong gus activity was detected in anthers and pollen . gus staining was weak in anthers and pollen of an aif gus mature flower at stage c carpel s sepal p _PROTEIN_ f filament . et al . reported that a group of _LOCATION_ bound nac transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are transported into the _LOCATION_ to regulate the _PROTEIN_ of downstream genes after release from the _LOCATION_ . because aif is predicted to be a member of the _PROTEIN_ family which contains a transmembrane domain in the c terminus of the protein it is possible that aif may also be processed and released from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and enter the _LOCATION_ to perform its function . to test this hypothesis the proteins that were isolated from wild type flowers were used to perform a western blot analysis with an anti aif antibody . if the aif protein was processed and released from the _LOCATION_ in young flower buds only a cleaved aif c would be detected by the anti aif antibody . as expected this band was clearly obtained . thus as proposed the aif protein must be processed and released from the _LOCATION_ in the young flower buds of wild type arabidopsis to perform its function . to test further the specificity of the anti aif antibody and the processing of the aif proteins transgenic plants that ectopically _PROTEIN_ the full length aif were further generated and the proteins from these aif _METHOD_ transgenic flowers were isolated in order to perform a western blot analysis using the anti aif antibody . two bands a aif c and an aif _METHOD_ _METHOD_ fusion protein were detected . the detection of the aif c band demonstrates that the transgenic as well as endogenous aif protein was processed and released from the _LOCATION_ in floral buds in the aif _METHOD_ transgenic plants . the detection of the aif _METHOD_ band indicates that some transgenic aif proteins were most probably not processed and released from the _LOCATION_ in the mature flowers in the aif _METHOD_ transgenic plants . detection of aif proteins in flowers and the localization of aif proteins in arabidopsis protoplasts . the protein structure of an uncleaved aif _METHOD_ that contains the fusion of the proteins aif and _METHOD_ . two peptides and will be produced after the aif _METHOD_ protein is processed and the fragment will be released from the _LOCATION_ . the anti aif antibody recognition site and the possible cleavage site for aif are indicated by arrows . the transmembrane domain in the c terminus of the aif protein is boxed . the detection by western blot analysis of various _METHOD_ of peptides for cleaved and uncleaved aif _METHOD_ in flowers . in wild type flowers only a cleaved aif c band was detected by the anti aif antibody . in aif _METHOD_ flowers a cleaved aif c band and an uncleaved aif _METHOD_ band were detected by the anti aif antibody . arabidopsis protoplasts transfected with _METHOD_ aif c _METHOD_ aif and _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ aif c _METHOD_ aif and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ images of the transfected protoplasts from c c and c respectively . the _METHOD_ aif c fusion proteins accumulate in the _LOCATION_ of the cell and the corresponding cell _LOCATION_ is indicated by the dashed circle . the _METHOD_ aif fusion proteins accumulate in the _LOCATION_ and are absent from the _LOCATION_ . the _METHOD_ proteins are dispersed in the cytoplasm . bar . to test this hypothesis further a strategy was adopted of transforming _METHOD_ fused with aif _METHOD_ or the aif cdna lacking its protein s c terminal region _METHOD_ into arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts and analysing their _METHOD_ images . a comparison of the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ images of the _LOCATION_ showed that only the _METHOD_ aif c fusion proteins accumulated in the _LOCATION_ of the cells . in contrast the _METHOD_ aif fusion proteins accumulated in the _LOCATION_ and were absent in the _LOCATION_ . as controls _METHOD_ _METHOD_ images were dispersed in the cytoplasm in the _METHOD_ transgenic arabidopsis . to investigate the function of the aif gene the cdna lacking the c terminal region of the aif gene driven by the camv promoter was transformed into arabidopsis . a total of three aif c transgenic arabidopsis plants showing similar abnormal phenotypes were obtained . when the inflorescence was examined a sterile flower phenotype was observed in these aif c transgenic plants with the siliques failing to elongate during _PROTEIN_ development . this phenotype was significantly different from that of the wild type inflorescence with its elongated and fully developed siliques . when the aif c flowers were examined they opened normally and produced normal sepals _PROTEIN_ and carpels with fully developed stigmatic papillae that were similar to those observed in wild type flowers . the anthers of these aif c flowers were indehiscent at all stages of flower development whereas the wild type anthers were dehiscent after stage of flower development . because the anthers of the aif c flowers were unable to open throughout flower development these flowers were sterile and unable to set seed . phenotypic analysis of the aif c and aif c _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis plants and the detection of gene _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis plants with altered aif

aif . in wild type flowers anthers were not dehiscent at stage . anthers were completely dehiscent and the pollen was released at stage . anther dehiscence was not observed in aif c or aif c _PROTEIN_ flowers at either stage or stage . in aif c flowers anthers were dehiscent and the pollen was released at stage . anthers were completely dehiscent at stage . to examine pollen viability further alexander s stain which can distinguish viable pollen from non viable pollen was applied . normal viability similar to that of the wild type pollen was observed in the aif c pollen . this finding indicates that some of the pollen that was produced in the aif c flowers was still functional . however non viable pollen grains with small and collapsed shapes were also observed . when further examined by _PROTEIN_ the pollen grains that were released from wild type anthers exhibited an egg shape of . when the indehiscent anthers from the stage flowers of the aif c plants were opened

shorter than those in . close up of the epidermal cells in the stamen filament of an aif c flower from which are similar to those in . bar in a d g and j in m n o and p in b e h and k and in c f i and l. when the stamens were further examined in the aif c flowers short stamen filaments were observed . when the epidermal cells in the stamen filaments were examined the short stamens in the aif c flowers were significantly reduced in cell elongation compared with that of the wild type stamens . the lengths of the stamens in the aif c plants were also approximately one third to a half the length of the wild type stamens indicating that the ectopic _PROTEIN_ of aif c altered cell expansion rather than proliferation during filament development . to explore the role of aif in regulating plant growth and development its function was evaluated through a loss of function analysis . when t dna insertional mutants of aif were analysed they were phenotypically indistinguishable from wild type plants in both vegetative and reproductive development . this finding indicates a possible functional redundancy between aif and other genes . to test this hypothesis a strategy for generating transgenic dominant loss of function mutant plants was employed by fusing a conserved _PROTEIN_ suppressing motif containing a amino acid repressor sequence _PROTEIN_ to aif c _PROTEIN_ . this strategy has been successfully used to generate dominant negative mutants for studying the function of transcriptional activators with redundant functions . a total of aif c _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants with the mutant phenotype were obtained . interestingly an unexpected phenotype was observed in these aif c _PROTEIN_ transgenic arabidopsis plants anther indehiscence and flower sterility which were similar to that of the aif c flowers . when the aif c _PROTEIN_ flowers were examined their anthers were indehiscent at all stages of flower development similar to those observed in the aif c transgenic flowers . similar to the aif c pollen viable and non viable pollen grains with small and collapsed shapes were observed in the aif c _PROTEIN_ flower by alexander s staining and _PROTEIN_ . to examine further the viability of the pollen mutant pollen grains were manually placed on the stigmas of mutant and wild type flowers and silique elongation and seed maturation were observed . the results confirmed that some of the pollen grains from the aif c _PROTEIN_ flowers were viable . the carpels of aif c _PROTEIN_ flowers were fertile because their siliques elongated and seeds were produced after pollination by wild type pollen . although the short filament phenotype was not clearly observed in some aif c _PROTEIN_ flowers short stamen filaments that were significantly reduced in cell elongation compared with the wild type stamens were also observed in some of the aif c _PROTEIN_ flowers similar to those in the aif c flowers . the presence of a conserved nard domain in aif indicates a possible transcriptional repressor role for aif . therefore the overexpression of aif c _PROTEIN_ may cause a similar repression and result in a phenotype similar to that observed in the aif c transgenic plants . the function of the _PROTEIN_ suppressing motif that was used in this study was confirmed by generating an ag mutant phenotype in transgenic arabidopsis flowers that were transformed with the construct _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to analyse further the cellular basis for anther dehiscence lignin staining with auramine o was performed in the endothecium of the developing anther in aif c aif c _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants in order to examine the formation of the secondary wall _PROTEIN_ . in the wild type plants secondary _PROTEIN_ occurs in the endothecium before anther dehiscence and the surrounding cell layers of the anther did not undergo secondary _PROTEIN_ . in stage just prior to anther dehiscence similar structural features in the secondary _PROTEIN_ of cell walls in the endothecium as well as pollen production were observed in wild type aif c _PROTEIN_ and aif c anthers . this result further supports the hypothesis that the developmental processes of the anther in aif c _PROTEIN_ and aif c plants proceed normally toward dehiscence but are interrupted instantly after septum/stomium breakage . this process is similar to that of the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants which are altered in ja biosynthesis . to investigate further the contrasting effects of the _PROTEIN_ suppressing motif an activation domain ad which included an amino acid activation sequence _PROTEIN_ was fused to aif in order to produce aif c . this strategy has been used successfully to generate dominant negative mutants for studying the function of transcriptional repressors with redundant functions . a total of aif c transgenic plants exhibiting the mutant phenotype were obtained . when the inflorescence was examined a novel sterile flower phenotype was observed the siliques failed to elongate during _PROTEIN_ development . the aif c flowers opened normally and produced normal sepals _PROTEIN_ and carpels with fully developed stigmatic papillae . in contrast to the wild type flowers early anther dehiscence was observed in the aif c transgenic plants . the stamens of the aif c flowers were prematurely dehiscent at early stage whereas the wild type anthers remained indehiscent at this stage . interestingly the early anther dehiscence phenotype of the aif c flowers was completely opposite to that which was observed for the aif c or aif c _PROTEIN_ flowers which showed anther indehiscence . because the early anther dehiscence of the aif c flowers prevented the pollen from reaching the stigmatic papillae of the carpel at the proper time these flowers were sterile and unable to set seeds . however different degrees of silique elongation were occasionally observed in these aif c flowers . this finding indicates that the pollen from the aif c flowers was able to function when it reached the stigmatic papillae . the viability of the aif c pollen was further confirmed by alexander s staining and _PROTEIN_ . the aif c flowers produced stamen filaments with epidermal cells similar in length to those of the wild type filaments . phenotypic analysis of the aif c arabidopsis and the flowers of aif c and aif c _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis plants with and without ja treatment . a day old aif c plants was sterile and produced short siliques . close up of the inflorescences of aif c that contained short and undeveloped siliques . close up of the inflorescences of aif c that contained short and undeveloped siliques as well as siliques with incomplete elongation . a well developed wild type silique and with five aif c siliques with different degrees of development and elongation . the aif c flower developed a well elongated silique after ja treatment whereas undeveloped short siliques were observed in aif c flowers without ja treatment . the anthers were dehiscent and the pollen was released in a aif c flower d after ja treatment . close up of the dehiscent anthers and the released pollen in . the anthers were dehiscent and the pollen was released in an aif c _PROTEIN_ flower d after ja treatment . close up of the dehiscent anthers and the released pollen in . the anthers were indehiscent in an aif c _PROTEIN_ flower d after tween treatment . the function of the ad activation domain that was used in this study was confirmed by generating a sup mutant phenotype in transgenic arabidopsis flowers that were transformed with the construct _PROTEIN_ dr _PROTEIN_ . mutations in genes that participate in ja biosynthesis cause a similar failure or delay of anther dehiscence resulting in male sterility in arabidopsis . does the ectopic _PROTEIN_ of aif c or aif c affect the _PROTEIN_ of these genes in transgenic plants and result in the alteration of anther dehiscence ? to answer this question total rna was extracted before stage from the flower buds of aif c aif c _PROTEIN_ and aif c transgenic plants and the _PROTEIN_ of genes that are involved in ja biosynthesis was analysed by real time quantitative rt pcr analysis . as expected the aif mrna was up regulated in the flower buds before stage in the aif c aif c _PROTEIN_ and aif c transgenic plants . interestingly the levels of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts were clearly down regulated in the flowers of both aif c and aif c _PROTEIN_ and were up regulated in the flowers of aif c . although the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was down regulated in the flowers of both aif c and aif c _PROTEIN_ its _PROTEIN_ was unaffected in the flowers of aif c . these results strongly suggest that the altered anther dehiscence in aif c aif c _PROTEIN_ and aif c plants is correlated with the altered _PROTEIN_ of some of the genes that participate in ja biosynthesis . to explore the correlation between defective pollen and ja biosynthesis further the pollen viability of the _PROTEIN_ mutant was examined using alexander s staining . when the indehiscent anthers of the _PROTEIN_ plants were opened manually most of the _PROTEIN_ pollen grains were non viable with small sizes and abnormal shapes . this result was in agreement with the very low viability of the pollen in the original characterization of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . et al . reported that an external supply of ja increased the pollen viability and rescued the sterility of the _PROTEIN_ flowers . when the _PROTEIN_ pollen grains were examined by alexander s staining after ja treatment pollen with normal viability as well as non viable pollen grains with small sizes and collapsed shapes were observed similar to what was observed in the aif c and aif c _PROTEIN_ pollen . this finding indicates that the defective pollen that is produced in the aif c and aif c _PROTEIN_ flowers is likely to be due to an alteration of ja signalling similar to that observed in the _PROTEIN_ mutants . to examine whether an external supply of ja rescues the sterility of the aif c or aif c _PROTEIN_ flowers similar to the ja treated _PROTEIN_ flowers ja was externally applied to the bud clusters of the aif c and aif c _PROTEIN_ plants . anther dehiscence and elongated siliques with seeds were observed in the ja treated aif c and aif c _PROTEIN_ flowers . this result was clearly different from the ja untreated mock flowers which lacked anther dehiscence and silique elongation . this result indicates that pollen grains of the aif c and aif c _PROTEIN_ flowers are fertile once the anthers are dehiscent in response to the external application of ja . because aif may be functionally redundant with other genes a loss of function analysis using an antisense strategy with dna fragments including a highly conserved nac domain for aif and its most closely related gene was performed . it was expected that aif and potentially redundant genes such as would be suppressed . a total of five antisense transgenic plants exhibiting the mutant phenotype were obtained . as expected a clear reduction of aif and _PROTEIN_ was observed in the antisense plants . this result indicates that the phenotypes of these antisense arabidopsis plants result from the simultaneous down regulation of both aif and the putative redundant genes . the vegetative leaf development of these transgenic plants was apparently normal . when the inflorescence was examined in these antisense plants sterile flowers were observed the siliques failed to elongate during _PROTEIN_ development . when the antisense flowers were examined they opened normally and produced normal flower organs . in contrast to wild type flowers early anther dehiscence was observed in the antisense plants . the short stamens of the antisense flowers were prematurely dehiscent at early stage similar to the stamens of the aif c transgenic flowers and completely opposite to those of the aif c and aif c _PROTEIN_ flowers which showed indehiscence of the anthers . because the short stamens of the antisense flowers were unable to reach the stigmatic papillae of the carpel these flowers were sterile and unable to set seeds . phenotypic analysis of antisense plants with the suppression of aif and _PROTEIN_ . a day old antisense plant was sterile and produced short siliques . close up of the inflorescences of antisense plant that contained short and undeveloped siliques whereas wild type plants produced long well developed siliques . mrna accumulation for aif and _PROTEIN_ was determined by real time quantitative rt pcr . total rnas isolated from the floral buds before stage of two antisense and one wild type columbia plants were used as templates . columns represent the relative _PROTEIN_ of the genes . transcript levels of these genes were determined using replicates and were normalized using _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ of each

pollen grains were manually placed on the stigmas of wild type flowers and silique elongation was observed . this finding indicates that the pollen from the antisense flowers was able to function when it reached the stigmatic papillae . the viability of the antisense pollen was further confirmed by _PROTEIN_ . furthermore the level of the _PROTEIN_ transcripts was also up regulated in the flower buds of the antisense plants before stage similar to what occurred in the aif c flowers . interestingly the increase in the _PROTEIN_ transcripts correlated with the _PROTEIN_ in the aif transcripts .
