inorganic phosphate is stored in the _LOCATION_ allowing plants to _PROTEIN_ to variable pi availability in the soil . the transporters that mediate pi sequestration into _LOCATION_ remain unknown however . here we report the functional characterization of _LOCATION_ phosphate transporter an spx domain protein that transports pi into the _LOCATION_ in arabidopsis . the mutant plants were stunted and consistently retained less pi than wild type plants especially when grown in medium containing high levels of pi . in seedlings was _PROTEIN_ primarily in younger tissues under normal conditions but was strongly induced by high pi conditions in older tissues suggesting that functions in pi storage in young tissues and in detoxification of high pi in older tissues . as a result disruption of rendered plants hypersensitive to both low pi and high pi conditions reducing the _PROTEIN_ of plants to changing pi availability . patch clamp analysis of isolated _LOCATION_ showed that the pi influx current was severely reduced in compared with wild type plants . when ectopically _PROTEIN_ in nicotiana benthamiana mesophyll cells mediates _LOCATION_ influx of anions including pi and malate with pi as that preferred anion . the mediated pi current amplitude was dependent on _LOCATION_ phosphate concentration . single channel analysis showed that the open probability of was increased with the increase in transtonoplast potential . we conclude that is a transporter responsible for _LOCATION_ pi storage and is essential for pi _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis .
in search of _LOCATION_ pi transporters in plants we focused our efforts on a functional analysis of the spx mfs family members for several reasons . first among the four arabidopsis spx domain containing protein families three of spx _PROTEIN_ spx _PROTEIN_ been functionally connected to pi nutrition . we suspected that the function of the fourth family spx mfs is also linked to pi nutrition . second the three members in the arabidopsis spx mfs family are the most closely related to yeast _LOCATION_ phosphate transporters such as scvtcs and . these members contain transmembrane domains according to tmhmm analysis and have a long n terminal tail and a large loop in the middle . we present a topological model of protein product encoded by _GENE_ as an example . these structural features are characteristic of a transporter . third a proteomic study indicated that arabidopsis spx _METHOD_ family members are associated with tonoplast fractions in arabidopsis plants . finally a related protein ospsx _METHOD_ has been linked to the pi content in rice leaves . taken together the foregoing studies suggest that members of the spx mfs family are qualified candidates for _LOCATION_ pi transporters . we began to test this hypothesis by genetic analysis of these genes using t dna insertional mutants of arabidopsis . among the three genes in the spx mfs cluster we obtained the knockout mutants of _GENE_ and . the ko mutant of did not show any phenotypic changes compared with the wt plant under variable pi conditions . thus in this report we focus on the characterization of a ko mutant of _GENE_ because this mutant was stunted under normal growth conditions in soil and even more so under high pi conditions in hydroponic culture . we named the gene _GENE_ as _LOCATION_ phosphate transporter based on our research described in this report . we further confirmed that the phenotype of the mutant resulted from lack of function by complementation using a genomic fragment of the gene . along with reductions in seedling _METHOD_ and root length earlier flowering and reduced seed yield were also apparent in the mutant plants grown in soil . we further analyzed root growth in the hydroponic culture under different pi concentrations . only under a very low pi level did the mutant appear similar to the wild type . as the pi concentration increased root elongation in the seedlings was severely inhibited compared with the wild type . interestingly the higher the pi levels in the medium the more severely inhibited the seedling growth and root elongation . stunted growth of was also apparent when grown on murashige and skoog _METHOD_ agar medium or in the nutrient sufficient soil . under both conditions pi levels were in the millimolar range consistent with the results obtained under hydroponic conditions . pi overdose in the environment is toxic to plants . under the conditions used in this study high pi levels in the medium not only inhibited plant growth but also caused plant death . when grown in the medium containing millimolar levels of pi the death rate of mutant seedlings was much higher than that of wild type further supporting the conclusion that disruption of the gene rendered the plants more sensitive to high pi toxicity . in addition to its detoxification action pi stored in the _LOCATION_ is also an important resource for coping with the pi deficiency often encountered by plants during their life cycle . if functions in _LOCATION_ pi sequestration then its mutant would have a smaller pi pool under pi sufficient conditions and logically less pi would be available when transferred to pi deficient conditions . indeed mutant plants suffered more than wild type plants after the change from a pi sufficient to a pi deficient condition . pi deficiency leads to accumulation of anthocyanin in leaves which was more severe in the mutant than in the wild type . consistent with this observation pi starvation response genes were induced to a higher level in the mutant compared with the wild type after the plants were transferred to the low pi condition . in contrast the same gene markers were _PROTEIN_ at a lower level in the mutant when the plants remained in pi sufficient condition indicating that _LOCATION_ pi levels were higher in the mutant owing to a defect in _LOCATION_ sequestration . plants absorb pi through _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ transporters and accumulate the large majority of pi in the _LOCATION_ . especially under high pi conditions plants often take up more pi and store excessive pi in the _LOCATION_ . if the _LOCATION_ sequestration mechanism is defective then plants would become more sensitive to high pi toxicity and at the same time accumulate less pi . we noted above that a lack of led to high pi toxicity in the mutant plants . to test whether the mutant is defective in pi retention we measured the pi content in both wild type and mutant seedlings . in all cases the mutant plants consistently retained less pi compared with the wild type _PROTEIN_ of pi concentrations in the culture medium . with the increased pi concentration in the growth medium the pi content in wild type plants steadily increased but the pi content in mutant plants quickly plateaued at a rather low level . because the plants were smaller in stature we suspected that this size difference could possibly affect the comparability of pi measurements in the wild type and mutant plants . thus we constructed a dexamethasone inducible _PROTEIN_ system in the mutant background . spraying with dex induced _PROTEIN_ and promoted pi accumulation in parallel . this result again links with pi retention in arabidopsis and supports the hypothesis that functions in _LOCATION_ pi sequestration . the _PROTEIN_ pattern of the gene in arabidopsis plants also supports its possible function as a _LOCATION_ pi storage transporter . according to the results of histochemical _PROTEIN_ staining of transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ a promoter gus fusion the promoter was more active in the younger tissues in both leaves and roots during vegetative growth . in the wk old seedlings the level in the young leaves was fold greater than that in the older leaves . with the increasing pi concentration in the growth medium the _PROTEIN_ of was strongly induced in both roots and leaves . interestingly a detailed analysis of _PROTEIN_ in leaves of different ages indicated that pi induction occurred more strongly in old leaves than in young leaves supporting the role of old leaves as detoxifying organs for the protection of the young leaves . indeed under normal conditions the pi content was higher in the younger leaves which correlated well with the _PROTEIN_ levels in leaves of different ages . under high pi conditions the increasing pi accumulation occurred _PROTEIN_ in the older leaves again consistent with pi induced _PROTEIN_ of in these leaves . not surprisingly mutant plants did not accumulate more pi under high pi conditions because they lacked the function responsible for such accumulation . genetic analysis of the mutant suggested that functions in _LOCATION_ sequestration . to further support this hypothesis we conducted experiments to show that protein is indeed located in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . we also measured the activity of in plant _LOCATION_ using a patch clamp procedure . to determine the subcellular localization of we constructed transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein _METHOD_ in the mutant background . if the fusion protein complemented the mutant phenotype this would indicate that this fusion protein is functional and localized to the correct subcellular compartment . the transgenic plants like the wild type grew well in the pi rich medium and _PROTEIN_ well to the low pi condition after transfer from the pi sufficient condition eliminating the growth defects in the mutant . moreover the pi content in the leaves of the transgenic plants was restored to the wild type level or even higher matching the _PROTEIN_ levels of the _METHOD_ mrna indicating that the fusion protein was functional . examination of the leaf epidermal cells by confocal microscopy revealed that _METHOD_ was localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . as shown in fig ref the _METHOD_ signal was clearly separated from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ stained with red _METHOD_ probe in the d old seedlings . on the other hand the _METHOD_ signal essentially overlapped with the _PROTEIN_ mcherry fusion protein a tonoplast marker . furthermore when _LOCATION_ were released from isolated mesophyll protoplasts of the transgenic plant they showed clear a _METHOD_ signal at the tonoplast . thus we concluded that was located in the tonoplast consistent with an earlier finding from proteomic analysis and this observation provided a prerequisite for our patch clamp analysis of activity in plant _LOCATION_ . to analyze the activity of in pi transport we established a patch clamp procedure to determine the inward currents carried by pi in _LOCATION_ isolated from arabidopsis mesophyll cells . as documented previously inward currents are defined as movement of a positive charge out of or a negative charge into the _LOCATION_ . we isolated intact _LOCATION_ from mesophyll cells of wild type and mutant plants and clamped them between and mv with a s duration and mv _PROTEIN_ . large time dependent pi inward currents were recorded in the wild type _LOCATION_ at negative test voltages and under the same experimental conditions the pi inward currents recorded from mutant _LOCATION_ were much smaller . at mv the current density in the mutant _LOCATION_ was reduced by > compared with the wild type _LOCATION_ . as shown earlier _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ fusion protein in the mutant background complemented the mutant phenotype . when _LOCATION_ from these plants were isolated and recorded the pi current density was also back to the wild type or slightly higher than the wild type matching the _PROTEIN_ levels of _METHOD_ in the transgenic plants . these results suggest that contributes strongly to the _LOCATION_ pi influx from the _LOCATION_ side into the _LOCATION_ lumen . to further confirm that mediates pi influx into the _LOCATION_ we transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in nicotiana benthamiana mesophyll cells and measured the _LOCATION_ pi current using _LOCATION_ decorated with the _METHOD_ signal . in parallel we used cells transformed with the empty vector alone as a control . as expected the control _LOCATION_ showed detectable pi inward currents similar to those recorded with wild type _LOCATION_ from arabidopsis however in the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ a much larger pi inward current was recorded compared with that in the control _LOCATION_ . on average the pi inward current densities in the corresponding _LOCATION_ were increased fivefold by _METHOD_ overexpression . taken together these results indicate that is responsible for a major portion of the pi inward current in _LOCATION_ under our experimental conditions . using the transient _PROTEIN_ system we characterized the mediated pi currents and found that these currents were dependent on _LOCATION_ pi concentration . when a low level of _LOCATION_ phosphate was applied _LOCATION_ inward current was detectable albeit at a small amplitude . when the _LOCATION_ pi reached a level symmetrical to that in the _LOCATION_ lumen the current amplitude of the _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ was increased by eightfold . the reversal potentials _LOCATION_ of currents shifted to more positive values with increasing _LOCATION_ pi concentrations . furthermore the _LOCATION_ values correlated well with the nernst prediction of phosphate equilibrium potential further supporting the idea that the recorded influx current was carried by pi . anion selectivity indicated that also contributed to the transport of other anions across the tonoplast but that phosphate transport was increased to the greatest degree by overexpression of _METHOD_ . consistent with this transport activity disruption of _PROTEIN_ in the mutant impaired the accumulation of pi but not of other anions including sulfate nitrate malate or chloride . these results further support the notion that the major function of is phosphate transport into the _LOCATION_ although mediated transport is not strictly selective for pi . we further analyzed the single channel currents in _LOCATION_ patches detached from _LOCATION_ isolated from n. benthamiana mesophyll cells transformed with either empty vector or the _METHOD_ construct . single channel activity was not detectable in the control _LOCATION_ . in contrast we detected single channel activity in the _LOCATION_ patches detached from _LOCATION_ isolated from _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cells . the channel open probability of increased with the more negative _LOCATION_ potentials . as the _LOCATION_ potential shifted from mv to mv the po increased more than fold . the current amplitude also increased linearly with more negative tonoplast potentials with a conductance of ps . the reversal potential of the single channels was mv which is very close to the nernst potential for phosphate _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ .
