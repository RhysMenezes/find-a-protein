in a chemical genetics screen we identified the small molecule piperidine ylmethanethione _METHOD_ that triggers rapid inhibition of early abscisic acid signal transduction via phytoalexin _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and enhanced disease _PROTEIN_ dependent immune signaling _METHOD_ . however _METHOD_ upstream of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ mediated signaling remain unknown . here we report that _METHOD_ generates an arabidopsis thaliana accession specific root growth arrest in columbia plants . the genetic locus responsible for this natural variant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ encodes a _PROTEIN_ nb lrr protein . analyses of t dna insertion _PROTEIN_ alleles showed that _PROTEIN_ is necessary for _METHOD_ induced root growth arrest and inhibition of abscisic acid induced stomatal closing . transgenic _PROTEIN_ of the col _PROTEIN_ allele in _METHOD_ insensitive arabidopsis accessions recapitulated the _METHOD_ induced root growth arrest . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ both central regulators of basal resistance and effector triggered immunity as well as _PROTEIN_ chaperones and their cochaperones _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are required for the _METHOD_ induced root growth arrest . salicylic acid and jasmonic acid signaling pathway components are dispensable . we further demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ associates with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in a _LOCATION_ protein complex . these findings show a previously unexplored association between a _PROTEIN_ nb lrr protein and _PROTEIN_ and identify functions of plant immune signaling components in the regulation of root meristematic zone targeted growth arrest .
the chemical compound _METHOD_ was isolated from a chemical library of compounds by screening for physiologically active small molecules that inhibit aba induced gene _PROTEIN_ and signal transduction . an in depth screen for additional visible phenotypic responses caused by _METHOD_ application identified a rapid root growth inhibition after _METHOD_ treatment . intriguingly this arrest was found to be specific for the col accession . _METHOD_ did not affect root growth of the arabidopsis landsberg _LOCATION_ accession . at a concentration of _METHOD_ root growth of col was blocked . the seedling root growth of other arabidopsis accessions including ler kindalville bayreuth and _PROTEIN_ were not affected by _METHOD_ treatment . we concluded that the col accession contains unusual natural genetic variation that causes _METHOD_ induced root growth arrest . based on the phenotype we refer to this class of genes as _PROTEIN_ . in response to _METHOD_ primary root growth of col was abrogated but secondary _PROTEIN_ root growth was not . chemical compounds structurally similar to _METHOD_ were analyzed to define critical structural motifs required for the triggering of the _PROTEIN_ phenotype . these analyses showed that modifications in the structure of several _METHOD_ related compounds can reduce the potency of the _METHOD_ response . although the slightly modified molecules _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ exhibited biological activity similar to the original _METHOD_ a chlorine in the four position seemed to be critical for eliciting the _PROTEIN_ phenotype . loss of activity was also caused by modifications of side groups as shown in _METHOD_ . whether _METHOD_ or a breakdown product thereof is the active compound remains to be determined . the root growth response caused by _METHOD_ was found to be time dependent . only h of _METHOD_ treatment was sufficient to initiate the _PROTEIN_ phenotype in an irreversible manner . primary root growth did not recover even d after seedlings were retransferred to standard growth media . microscopy examination of the morphological changes of col roots treated with _METHOD_ revealed a large reduction of the meristematic and elongation zones whereas root differentiation such as vascular and _PROTEIN_ root formation did not show any observable differences indicating that _METHOD_ may target the primary root meristematic zone . to investigate molecular changes in _METHOD_ treated primary root tips the pattern of local auxin accumulation was examined using promoter driven green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ lines in the col background . _METHOD_ treatment for d did not change the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ activity at the columella at the root tip . after d of _METHOD_ treatment no _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ activity was visible at the columella of col consistent with the model that _METHOD_ targets the primary root meristem . however the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct has been reported to have certain limitations as an auxin reporter and to not necessarily correlate with other auxin sensitive genes . therefore to measure the effect of _METHOD_ on auxin transporters in the primary root _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ col lines were monitored as a function of time after _METHOD_ exposure . after h of _METHOD_ treatment both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals became weaker . at h when _METHOD_ mediated root growth arrest becomes visible both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ levels _PROTEIN_ substantially . these results indicate that altered _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ activities and resulting changes in the auxin gradient which is important to _PROTEIN_ meristematic cell divisions might contribute to _METHOD_ mediated root growth inhibition . scarecrow _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was analyzed as an endodermal and quiescent center marker gene . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was disrupted after d of _METHOD_ treatment when _METHOD_ had already produced obvious morphological differences . however _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ exhibited a normal pattern of _PROTEIN_ after d of _METHOD_ treatment . therefore the disrupted _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in col might be a secondary effect of the altered root morphology after _METHOD_ treatment . consistent with the deregulated and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ patterns induced after d by _METHOD_ cell cycle activity monitored by the cyclin _PROTEIN_ promoter was disrupted by _METHOD_ treatment . retention of the normal _PROTEIN_ pattern of cyclin _PROTEIN_ in secondary root _METHOD_ demonstrates the tissue specificity of the _METHOD_ effect . these marker line analyses suggesting that _METHOD_ targets the primary root meristematic zone led us to further explore how _METHOD_ mediates root growth arrest . to identify the genetic element in col producing the _PROTEIN_ phenotype col ler recombinant inbred lines that have been genotyped using microarrays were screened for the _PROTEIN_ phenotype . quantitative trait locus analyses of the phenotypic scores and available genetic map information for these rils suggested that a single locus in col positioned on the lower arm of chromosome might determine _METHOD_ induced root arrest . seedlings of col crosses to ler produced the col _PROTEIN_ phenotype upon _METHOD_ treatment indicating that heterozygous _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ allele is sufficient to confer the _METHOD_ response in the ler background . consistent with qtl analyses of the col ler rils seedlings of a col cross to ler segregated at a ratio of indicating that a single locus mediates the _PROTEIN_ phenotype . using these segregating _PROTEIN_ plants map based cloning narrowed down the candidate _PROTEIN_ locus to a kb region . since _PROTEIN_ is a natural variant present in col any polymorphic gene within the target region could encode _PROTEIN_ . because _PROTEIN_ was necessary and sufficient for the _METHOD_ response and was hypothesized to represent an active allele t dna insertion mutants of genes located within the target region in col were examined . among the t dna lines tested only t dna insertion lines in gene _GENE_ displayed complete insensitivity in _METHOD_ mediated root growth arrest . five independent t dna insertion mutants in the col _GENE_ gene showed loss of _METHOD_ triggered root arrest . _METHOD_ inhibits primary root growth in col but not in the _PROTEIN_ mutants . to determine how _METHOD_ mediates this effect confocal images of col _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ primary roots were analyzed . while the quiescent center cells and cortical stem cells appeared unaffected by h of _METHOD_ treatment in all three genotypes the division zone of the _METHOD_ treated col primary roots was smaller than that of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ primary roots . to further analyze this phenotype we quantified the number of meristematic cells in the division zones of primary roots . our data indicate that when treated with _METHOD_ for h col primary roots show a reduced number of meristem cells in the division zone of the primary root compared with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . this shorter division zone and the reduced number of meristematic cells are consistent with the inhibition of primary root growth first observable after h of _METHOD_ treatment in col wild type and may represent the initial phase of _METHOD_ induced growth inhibition . the most similar gene to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is located in tandem upstream of _PROTEIN_ . a t dna mutant _PROTEIN_ was not resistant to _METHOD_ treatment in the root growth arrest response . this suggests that the _PROTEIN_ gene is required for the chemical _METHOD_ response targeting primary root meristem activity . chemical genetics can provide an approach for identifying phenotypes in potentially redundant signal transduction genes via small molecule targeting of specific proteins . _PROTEIN_ is predicted to encode a previously uncharacterized member of the nb lrr family with a _PROTEIN_ motif _PROTEIN_ at the n terminus . _PROTEIN_ nb lrr family members can function as immune signaling proteins encoded by r genes responding to specific pathogen effectors in plants . compared with characterized r proteins the predicted _PROTEIN_ protein shows high sequence similarity to that of the col allele of _PROTEIN_ from accession ksk which mediates _PROTEIN_ independent resistance to albugo candida . _PROTEIN_ is in the same cluster of r genes as _PROTEIN_ that specifies resistance to the pseudomonas syringae effector . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ contains unique polymorphism that define the col sensitivity to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cdna sequences from other accessions were reverse transcribed and compared with _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ gene is highly diverged and possibly absent in ler and also in wassilewskija based on pcr analysis . comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences in the _PROTEIN_ containing ecotypes bay and kin shows that _PROTEIN_ has multiple unique amino acid _METHOD_ centered in the nb domain and the linker region between the nb and lrr domains . the promoter sequences of the _PROTEIN_ genes are highly conserved . to further establish whether _METHOD_ induced primary root growth inhibition in col is dependent on _METHOD_ present in the coding region of _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ under the control of its natural col promoter was introduced into accessions insensitive to _METHOD_ ler _PROTEIN_ and bay . the introduction of _PROTEIN_ was sufficient to generate the _METHOD_ response in primary roots of ler _PROTEIN_ and bay demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ is the only missing component required for the _METHOD_ induced primary root growth arrest in these accessions . as reported for other r proteins ectopic _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the col background caused stunted plant growth . resistance genes are generally _PROTEIN_ ubiquitously and at very low levels in unchallenged plants . electronic arabidopsis gene _PROTEIN_ resources including atgenexpress and _METHOD_ browser indicate that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ at a low level in many different tissue types . interestingly when treated with _METHOD_ for h _PROTEIN_ was highly induced in the col background . bay and _PROTEIN_ which carry a polymorphic _PROTEIN_ gene relative to _PROTEIN_ but are not sensitive to _METHOD_ did not exhibit enhancement of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in response to _METHOD_ treatment . more detailed analyses of _PROTEIN_ promoter driven gus _PROTEIN_ reporter and yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ reporter lines showed dramatic _METHOD_ enhanced _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene in the root meristematic zone . these results suggest that the _METHOD_ induced root growth arrest may be caused by differential spatial upregulation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the primary root tip region . notably induction of the _PROTEIN_ gene by _METHOD_ treatment requires functional _PROTEIN_ because _METHOD_ could not induce the _PROTEIN_ promoter in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . on the other hand the promoter of _PROTEIN_ whose sequence is highly similar to that of _PROTEIN_ activated _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ by _METHOD_ treatment when introduced into the col wild type . altogether these results suggest that functional _PROTEIN_ mediates _METHOD_ induced positive feedback regulation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and that amino acid polymorphism in _PROTEIN_ are responsible for the _PROTEIN_ phenotype . consistent with this bay _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under the _PROTEIN_ promoter exhibited _METHOD_ mediated root growth arrest and also increased _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ upon _METHOD_ treatment . such positive feedback regulation has been observed for r genes and is part of the resistance response induced by corresponding avirulent pathogens . the finding that _PROTEIN_ encodes a _PROTEIN_ nb lrr family r like protein and previous indications that _METHOD_ induces defense related gene _PROTEIN_ raise the hypothesis that pathogen triggered biotic stress signaling and/or salicylic acid signaling is responsible for generation of the _PROTEIN_ root growth arrest phenotype . to test this hypothesis and to identify additional genetic components of the _METHOD_ mediated signaling pathway pathogen mutants in col were analyzed to determine whether they exhibit altered root growth responses to _METHOD_ . among the mutants analyzed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations disrupted the _METHOD_ induced root growth arrest as did the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . no _METHOD_ resistance was observed in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are also required for _METHOD_ inhibition of aba induced stomatal closure . therefore _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants were analyzed for the ability of _METHOD_ to impair aba induced stomatal closing in genotype blind assays . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants showed impairment in _METHOD_ inhibition of aba induced stomatal closing . to investigate the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ fluorophores were fused to either its n or c terminus . all constructs showed that _PROTEIN_ localized to the _LOCATION_ with localization also in the cytoplasm as indicated by faint _METHOD_ in transient onion epidermis _PROTEIN_ assays . arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ nb lrr proteins such as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ also display nucleocytoplasmic distributions . in transient agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated overexpression and immunological detection of the _PROTEIN_ constructs in nicotiana benthamiana plants _PROTEIN_ fusion protein levels were low but detectable based on _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and immunoblots . in n. benthamiana _PROTEIN_ analyses we coexpressed red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ constructs allowing us to clearly identify transformed cells visualize _LOCATION_ and perform colocalization analyses . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was preferentially _LOCATION_ localized and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ merged with _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . although > of cells showed _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was detected in only to of transformed cells . immunoblot analyses identified _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusions at the expected size suggesting that the detected _METHOD_ is not due to either _METHOD_ alone or _METHOD_ fused to truncated _PROTEIN_ . the requirement for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ dependent root inhibition prompted us to investigate in vivo protein complex associations of _PROTEIN_ with these proteins . recent studies have shown that the _PROTEIN_ nb lrr resistance proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ coreside in protein complexes with _PROTEIN_ . pathogen effectors that might signal _PROTEIN_ dependent primary root growth arrest are presently not known and effectors that cause root growth arrest have not yet been determined . such putative effectors may also redundantly use the tandem repeat homolog _PROTEIN_ . identification of molecular interactors of _PROTEIN_ is relevant toward understanding _PROTEIN_ protein functions . bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation an efficient tool to study in vivo protein protein interactions can be used to identify molecular complexes of key innate immunity components . an inherent feature of this assay is its irreversibility allowing capture of transient interactions . confocal microscopy analysis of transiently _PROTEIN_ bifc fusion combinations of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana cells suggested _LOCATION_ complexes of _PROTEIN_ with these two proteins . _PROTEIN_ did not show associations with the reciprocal bifc vectors _PROTEIN_ gus that also accumulated inside _LOCATION_ . heterodimers of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ display nucleocytoplasmic distributions . however our bifc results can not distinguish whether _PROTEIN_ associates with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ heterodimer including complexes or within protein complexes individually with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ proteins which warrants further investigations . our results suggest cocomplex formation of a _PROTEIN_ nb lrr protein with the _PROTEIN_ signaling partner _PROTEIN_ . this is in marked contrast with the _PROTEIN_ nb lrr r proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which did not show an interaction with _PROTEIN_ in transient _PROTEIN_ assays . we independently investigated the above results by performing coimmunoprecipitation assays on transiently transformed n. benthamiana cells . n terminally hemagglutinin epitope tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was coexpressed either with cmyc tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or gus . because _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was enriched in the _LOCATION_ we isolated purified _LOCATION_ from the infiltrated leaf tissues and performed _LOCATION_ co ip assays . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but not gus coimmunoprecipitated with _PROTEIN_ . these results validated the associations of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins in _LOCATION_ detected by bifc . using a mutated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ that does not heterodimerize with _PROTEIN_ we tested whether _PROTEIN_ associates with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ heterodimers or individually with _PROTEIN_ . as expected the _PROTEIN_ mutant showed a strongly diminished interaction with _PROTEIN_ in transient n. benthamiana bifc assays . we then performed co ip assays on transiently transformed n. benthamiana cells . n terminally ha epitope tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was coexpressed either with cmyc tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or gus . purified _LOCATION_ from the infiltrated leaf tissues were isolated and _LOCATION_ co ip assays performed . _PROTEIN_ wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but not gus coimmunoprecipitated with _PROTEIN_ supporting that _PROTEIN_ can form complexes with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ inside _LOCATION_ . senescence associated _PROTEIN_ has also been shown to form a protein complex with _PROTEIN_ . as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ loss of function mutants showed a strong _METHOD_ insensitivity we tested _PROTEIN_ loss of function mutants for the _METHOD_ induced root growth arrest response . in contrast with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant plants behaved like col wild type controls . thus we propose that _METHOD_ may trigger root growth inhibition by activating an _PROTEIN_ independent branch of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ signaling . the _PROTEIN_ chaperones functionally stabilize and _PROTEIN_ r proteins in a signaling competent state and their activity is dependent on at least two different cochaperones _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in root assays the single mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ exhibited _METHOD_ insensitivity . since the arabidopsis genome contains four _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with three located in close proximity within a kb region on chromosome the effect of the _PROTEIN_ inhibitor geldanamycin on the _METHOD_ response was analyzed . gda inhibits cancer cell proliferation by irreversibly binding to the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ proteins . a concentration of gda was sufficient to completely abolish col specific _METHOD_ root growth inhibition consistent with the observed _METHOD_ resistance of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . this suggests that _PROTEIN_ cooperates with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to stabilize _PROTEIN_ as a prerequisite for the _METHOD_ root growth response . the _PROTEIN_ mutant defective in sa biosynthesis and a sa depleted nahg transgenic line were not affected in the _METHOD_ induced root growth response . with the exception of the resistance signaling components described above other known pathogen response loci were also not required for the _METHOD_ induced root growth arrest . these include the nb lrr genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ immune signaling and response components _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and a pathogen associated molecular pattern _PROTEIN_ receptor _PROTEIN_ as well as the jasmonic acid signaling components _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . although application of exogenous sa also caused root growth inhibition detailed inspection showed that the sa effect on root growth inhibition is morphologically clearly distinct from the _METHOD_ induced root growth arrest in several respects . sa blocks general growth of arabidopsis seedlings including root elongation _PROTEIN_ root initiation and root hair formation in contrast with _METHOD_ . also the sa induced root growth inhibition is not accession specific because the response to sa was equivalent in col and ler .

are ggacgctttgtttccagcttgtggggcattaaatcgag and cacttcgtagggcgttggggcagacattgccttctc . to generate _PROTEIN_ promoter driven reporter lines a kb fragment from the start codon of col and bay was pcr
