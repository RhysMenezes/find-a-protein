to identify molecular players implicated in cytokinesis and division plane determination the arabidopsis thaliana genome was explored for potential cytokinesis genes . more than open reading frames were selected based on similarity to yeast and animal cytokinesis genes _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ genes and nicotiana tabacum genes showing cell cycle controlled _PROTEIN_ . the subcellular localization of these proteins was determined by means of _METHOD_ tagging in tobacco bright yellow cells and arabidopsis plants . detailed confocal microscopy identified proteins targeted to distinct regions of the phragmoplast and the cell plate . and like proteins were associated with the plus end the minus end or along the entire length of microtubules . the actin binding protein myosin the kinase aurora and a novel cell cycle protein designated accumulated preferentially at the midline . and aurora in addition to other regulatory proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were targeted to the _LOCATION_ suggesting that this organelle operates as a coordinating hub for cytokinesis .
