arabidopsis embryos carrying the mutation grow slowly in comparison with wild type embryos and as a consequence reach only the globular stage at desiccation . the primary defect of the mutation at the cellular level is the large size of the nucleolus that can be observed soon after fertilization in the _LOCATION_ of both the embryo and the endosperm . the ultrastructure of mutant nucleoli is drastically different from wild type and points to a fault in ribosome biogenesis . encodes a protein which belongs to a plant specific gene family sharing a common motif of unknown function present in the tomato _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein . using a _METHOD_ protein fusion we show that is targeted to the _LOCATION_ . we propose that inactivation of has a negative effect on ribosome biogenesis and on the rate of cell division .
