the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport _PROTEIN_ guides transmembrane proteins to domains that bud away from the cytoplasm . the _PROTEIN_ machinery consists of four complexes . _PROTEIN_ complexes ii are important for cargo recognition and concentration via ubiquitin binding . most of the _LOCATION_ bending function is mediated by the large multimeric _PROTEIN_ iii complex and associated proteins . here we present the first in vivo proteome analysis of a member of the _PROTEIN_ iii complex which is unique to the plant kingdom . we show with lc _METHOD_ yeast two hybrid and bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation that coimmunoprecipitated proteins from arabidopsisthaliana roots _PROTEIN_ a functional _METHOD_ tagged _LOCATION_ protein sorting protein are members of the _PROTEIN_ iii complex and associated proteins . therefore we propose that at least in plants the large _PROTEIN_ iii _LOCATION_ scaffolding complex consists of a mixture of and the associated _PROTEIN_ and proteins . apart from transmembrane proteins numerous _LOCATION_ associated but also _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ proteins have been identified indicating that might be involved in processes beyond the classical _PROTEIN_ role . this study is the first in vivo proteome analysis with a tagged _PROTEIN_ iii component demonstrating the feasibility of this approach and provides numerous starting points for the investigation of the biological process in which is involved .
to reveal if and how the _PROTEIN_ iii complex is cooperating with other proteins including potential mvb targets we used transgenic arabidopsis seedlings _PROTEIN_ a c terminally _METHOD_ tagged _METHOD_ under the endogenous promoter as bait for immunoprecipitation studies . even though it has been shown that a c terminal fusion to the human was able to be integrated into _PROTEIN_ iii filaments _PROTEIN_ an overexpressed _METHOD_ fusion inhibits mvb maturation and viral budding and the _METHOD_ filaments had a tighter appearance . _PROTEIN_ while _METHOD_ dimerization was excluded to cause _PROTEIN_ effect the c terminal fusion enhanced the interaction . therefore the choice for the proteomic approach with an _PROTEIN_ iii component was based on the possibility to prove the functionality of the construct . while mutants of exhibit a strong root growth phenotype _PROTEIN_ mutants of are lethal and the knock out of has a week root growth defect . _PROTEIN_ moreover is one of the most conserved _PROTEIN_ iii components with up to three copies in the genomes of metazoa fungi amoebozoa viridiplantae phodophyta apicomplexa ciliates stramenopiles discicristata and metamonada . is the only _PROTEIN_ iii component which has been identified so far by a proteomic approach in plants . to evaluate the functionality of the _METHOD_ construct we first investigated its ability to complement the _PROTEIN_ root growth phenotype . of seven independent transformants with _PROTEIN_ background three restored root growth to the level of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ wildtype plants . the _PROTEIN_ level and stability of the fusion construct in transgenic seedlings was quantified by western blots . finally the microscopic analyses show that the _METHOD_ is visible primarily in punctuated/vesicular structures of root _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ complements _PROTEIN_ phenotypes and is predominantly _PROTEIN_ in root _METHOD_ . wildtype and _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ develop significantly longer roots than untransformed _PROTEIN_ substantiating the functionality of the construct _PROTEIN_ . yet all transformants develop shorter roots than untransformed wildtype seedlings . root lengths were determined of at least seedlings days after germination on _METHOD_ medium supplemented with sucrose . the significance was calculated by students t tests . stability and prevalent root _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ fusion protein and the specificity of the _METHOD_ antibody was determined by western blot analyses loading total proteins of wildtype root of seedlings _PROTEIN_ an unstable _METHOD_ fusion protein _METHOD_ roots and shoot extracts of wildtype seedlings _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . while in the unstable _METHOD_ control extract a degradation product is detectable the _METHOD_ fusions are stable . roots of days old seedlings _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ is predominantly _PROTEIN_ in root _METHOD_ . based on the three criteria supporting the functionality of _METHOD_ root extracts of transgenic seedlings were used for three independent ips followed by lc _METHOD_ analysis . to increase the stringency of the analyses root extracts of wildtype and _METHOD_ overexpressing seedlings were included as negative controls . in total proteins were isolated . interactors were defined as specific if they were represented by at least two peptides were not pulled down with the negative controls or the peptide coverage was more than fold enriched in comparison to the negative controls . with these stringent criteria interaction partners of were sorted out _PROTEIN_ . strategy to purify and identify _METHOD_ interacting proteins . roots were separated from seedlings cushed in liquid nitrogen lysed with cracking buffer on ice and centrifuged to separate cell debris . anti _METHOD_ microbeads were added to the supernatant mixed by rotating and after incubation on ice applied onto columns . the eluted proteins were separated on a denaturing _PROTEIN_ and visualized with a lc _METHOD_ compatible silver staining protocol . lanes were excised into up to fractions and subjected to nanoelectrospray lc _METHOD_ sequencing . example of a silver stained _PROTEIN_ showing the eluates from extracts of control roots transgenes _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the eluted beads . indicated are proteins which have been specifically enriched by this method . proteins are sorted by abundance of identified peptides . annotation to cellular compartments and the occurrence in other proteomic analyses are indicated . mw molecular weight ip immunoprecipitation tmd transmembrane domain sp signal peptide gpi gpi anchor n myr myristoylation site . not surprisingly two _PROTEIN_ iii components have been successfully pulled down indicating that the c terminal _METHOD_ tag did not affect the interaction . yet three _PROTEIN_ iii associated proteins and were identified as interactors which have previously not been described to interact with homologues in other _METHOD_ . to support our findings of the biochemically identified interactions yeast to hybrid and _METHOD_ complementation analyses in arabidopsis protoplasts were carried out and supported some of these novel interactions . the results indicate that the composition of _PROTEIN_ iii complexes might vary and/or diverse _PROTEIN_ iii complexes exist with different composition in plants . _PROTEIN_ iii components are encoded in the arabidopsis genome by at least two and the gene family by three genes . _PROTEIN_ mutant analyses show that is embryo lethal while mutants of and have root growth defects . _PROTEIN_ in contrast to and did not show a microtubule interacting and transport interacting motif _PROTEIN_ dependent interaction with the deubiquitinating enzyme _METHOD_ . furthermore in contrast to and did not accumulate in class e compartments induced by overexpression of a dominant negative . _PROTEIN_ in vivo interaction studies of with known and novel interacting partners of the _PROTEIN_ iii complex . yeast two hybrid analyses showing growth assays for homo and heterodimerization and the autoactivation of the dna binding domain fusion . the identity of the cotransformants is indicated on the left the selective media above and the strength of the interactions on the right . shown are spotted undiluted and diluted cultures . bifc interactions in arabidopsis protoplasts demonstrating homo and heterodimerizations of with and . the interactions label vesicles in the cytoplasm and at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to elucidate if and its interactors are enriched in specific subcellular compartments the identified proteins were categorized based on gene ontology annotations _PROTEIN_ . also secondary structure predictions and post translational modification motifs characteristic for subcellular localizations were used for the classification such as transmembrane domains signal peptides and myristoylation signatures _PROTEIN_ . none of the _METHOD_ interactors had signals for gpi anchors prenylation or palmitoylation . only the iba response protein contains a myristoylation motif and is annotated as peroxisomal protein . although the classical function of the _PROTEIN_ iii complex in the biogenesis of mvbs suggests that _METHOD_ interactors might be targeted to lytic compartments only four proteins are annotated to _LOCATION_ . since these proteins are known to be _LOCATION_ associated they probably locate at the tonoplast . however interactors have also been identified in five published proteomic studies of isolated _LOCATION_ . none of these are classical luminal _LOCATION_ proteins . subcellular localization of interacting proteins . venn _METHOD_ of the overlap between _METHOD_ interactors and proteins that have been isolated from _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . the colored _PROTEIN_ codes of the proteins correspond to the overlapping sectors . the first authors of the publications used for comparison are also color coded . according to the gene ontology annotation eight interactors out of the proteins are assigned to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ plate and/or tonoplast _PROTEIN_ . they include a member of the water channel protein family _PROTEIN_ and the h _PROTEIN_ . comparison to published proteomic studies revealed that interactors have been previously isolated in _LOCATION_ fractions . _PROTEIN_ half of them were identified also in phosphoproteomes . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ apart from the two integral _LOCATION_ proteins which might be substrates of the _PROTEIN_ machinery six dynamin related proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were pulled down _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ interact and stimulate dynamin _PROTEIN_ activity _PROTEIN_ but interactions of _PROTEIN_ iii components with both _PROTEIN_ and dynamins have not been shown yet . in eukaryotic cells _PROTEIN_ functions include but are not limited to the endocytic and exocytic pathways where they for example are involved in the generation and fusion of secretory vesicles . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in mammalian cells _PROTEIN_ could be found at sites of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ where exocytosis occurs . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ facilitate the bending of _LOCATION_ due to the cone shaped geometry of their hydrolysis product phosphatidic acid _PROTEIN_ which induces a negative curvature . furthermore the _PROTEIN_ products phosphatidylserine and _PROTEIN_ create an acidic environment at the cytoplasmic leaflet of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ where the basic surface of _PROTEIN_ iii subunits and associated proteins can electrostatically bind . whitley et al . identified a specific lysine on human _PROTEIN_ that binds phosphatidylinositol l bisphosphate and which is highly conserved in all domain containing _PROTEIN_ iii subunits and associated proteins . _PROTEIN_ thus it is likely that _PROTEIN_ modified _LOCATION_ are attracting _PROTEIN_ iii subunits . is a plant specific _PROTEIN_ with a polybasic ptdins binding motif a g protein interacting motif and a _PROTEIN_ domain which mediates dependent phospholipid association . is present on intercellular _LOCATION_ and translocates between _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ in response to stress . binds in the same manner as dynamin to ptdins bisphosphate and it is likely that both are recruited to the same _LOCATION_ domains . dynamin oligmers have been visualized with electron microscopy on necks of endocytotic vesicles . the classical view of dynamin mediated _LOCATION_ fission is that upon narrowing and stretching dynamin oligomeres _LOCATION_ loose their stability and abscission occurs . recently it has been shown that long dynamin oligomers are not necessary for _LOCATION_ fission and it is postulated that limited dynamin assembly rearrange local lipids in such a way that nonleaky fission events can occur . therefore it is possible that dynamins support _PROTEIN_ iii mediated _LOCATION_ narrowing and lipid rearrangements at the neck . we can not exclude that the interaction of an _PROTEIN_ iii subunit with dynamins is only restricted to the plant specific member of the protein family . _PROTEIN_ an unexpected high fraction of seven interactors are annotated to the _LOCATION_ and five more have been isolated in proteome studies of isolated _LOCATION_ . although _METHOD_ localizes primarily to vesicles of different sizes and at distinct domains of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ weak _METHOD_ signals are also detected in _LOCATION_ of root _METHOD_ . we found specific interactions with _LOCATION_ proteins such as histone and five rna binding proteins including _PROTEIN_ dependent helicases _PROTEIN_ a poly binding protein _PROTEIN_ a spliceosome subunit _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ transport _PROTEIN_ and a putative _LOCATION_ rna binding protein . these interactions and the localization of raise the possibility that might function in gene regulation as well . _METHOD_ localizes to distinct region of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in cytoplasmic vesicles separated for the trans _LOCATION_ network marker and in _LOCATION_ of root _METHOD_ . root tips of seedlings _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ root _METHOD_ of seedlings _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the tng marker _METHOD_ close up of the marked area in b demonstrating that _METHOD_ localizes strongly to the transverse cell borders to vesicles of different sizes in the cytoplasm and diffusely in the _LOCATION_ . root area at the upper end of the meristem with diffuse _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ localization . same root area as in d but labeled with the _METHOD_ dna stain dapi . overlay of d and e. venn diagram of the overlap between _METHOD_ interactors and proteins that have been isolated from and annotated to the _LOCATION_ . the colored _PROTEIN_ codes of the proteins correspond to the overlapping sectors . the first authors of the publications used for comparison are also color coded . this possibility is further substantiated by earlier findings with the human _PROTEIN_ iii associated protein _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ has been localized in the _LOCATION_ and interacts with the transcriptional repressor polycomb like protein on condensed chromatin suggesting its role in gene silencing . _PROTEIN_ furthermore the human homologue of _PROTEIN_ is also known as breast adenocarcinoma marker due to its strong upregulation . bc has been identified in the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ to both diffuse and discrete speckles . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ induces condensed chromatin regions where a pcg complex protein a predominantely _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized small ras family _PROTEIN_ and the phosphorylated histone are recruited . based on these findings and similar to _PROTEIN_ probably participates also in _LOCATION_ events as well . ten of the _METHOD_ interactors have also been isolated in proteome studies aimed to enrich for _LOCATION_ proteins of the cell wall the apoplast and the phloem sap . none of these _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ interactors belong to classical secretory proteins . however _PROTEIN_ proteins have been recently identified in the proteome of secreted vesicles of archaeal sulfolobus species . _PROTEIN_ one explanation is that the mechanism of budding of vesicles in archeae is similar to the release of exosomes and viruses . in both events the _PROTEIN_ machinery is involved . exosomes are well studied in mammals and function in cell cell communication . even mrna and mirna are transported via exosomes between cells . the exocarta database which includes studies on exosome proteomes revealed that apart from the classical exosomal markers related to the _PROTEIN_ machinery _PROTEIN_ and alix also the _PROTEIN_ i components _PROTEIN_ b c d the _PROTEIN_ ii components _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ iii core and associated proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and b _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and b and _PROTEIN_ and b and have been isolated from exosomes . interestingly all of the other noncanonically secreted proteins of our proteome analyses such as _PROTEIN_ a proteasome subunit a fructose biphosphate aldolase an s adenosyl l homocysteine hydrolase _PROTEIN_ heat shock proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and rna binding proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are also present in the exocarta database . atypical subcellular localization of interacting proteins . venn _METHOD_ of the overlap between _METHOD_ interactors and proteins that have been isolated from and annotated to the apoplast cell wall and phloem sap . the colored _PROTEIN_ codes of the proteins correspond to the overlapping sectors . the first authors of the publications used for comparison are also color coded . model how _PROTEIN_ iii might mediate vesicle budding and fission in conjunction with dynamins and _PROTEIN_ . several dynamins assemble and interact with the _PROTEIN_ iii subunit on _LOCATION_ domains on the inner side of the neck which is acidified by _PROTEIN_ . this association supports _LOCATION_ narrowing and lipid rearrangements at the neck of budding vesicles away from the cytoplasm so that _LOCATION_ fission and fusion occurs . since _METHOD_ interacts also with other _PROTEIN_ iii components we propose that at least in plants the large _LOCATION_ scaffolding complex consists of a mixture of and the associated and proteins . dark green middle green blue dark blue light yellow light gray dark gray _PROTEIN_ yellow to orange dynamins gray neutral lipids red acidified lipids . arrows indicate the forces that upon constriction of _PROTEIN_ iii and dynamins mediate _LOCATION_ fission and fusion . in plants secreted _PROTEIN_ iii components and interactors have been identified in the apoplastic fluid and the phloem sap . on the microscopic level paramural vesicles share some characteristics with mvbs and exosomes . such paramural vesicles have recently been detected at fungal penetration sites and during plugging of plasmodesmata between hypersensitive cells and intact neighboring cells . however further studies are needed for a conclusive demonstration of the involvement of an _PROTEIN_ mediated secretion in plants . vesicle mediated transport in the secretory and endocytic pathways involves the assembly of coat protein complexes on the cytoplasmic face of a lipid bilayer . the _PROTEIN_ machinery might function similarly by recruiting and concentrating _LOCATION_ proteins into microdomains of vesicle buds that are sequestered away from the cytoplasm . while _PROTEIN_ i and ii induces initial _LOCATION_ buds _PROTEIN_ iii subunits form large _LOCATION_ scaffolding protein complexes of filamentous and spiral appearance which push _LOCATION_ away from the cytoplasm creating tubes with dome like caps at the neck . _PROTEIN_ the order and ratio of _PROTEIN_ iii subunits is only loosely defined and starts with the myristoylated and _LOCATION_ inserted subunit . continuous self assembly of _PROTEIN_ iii subunits _PROTEIN_ and inside the tube and neck stabilizes and narrows the _LOCATION_ and ultimately leads to _LOCATION_ scission . in this study we have identified and established novel partners of the _PROTEIN_ iii component _METHOD_ in particular dynamins and _PROTEIN_ which might assist in pinching off vesicular packages from _LOCATION_ to deliver cargoes to other subcellular or even _LOCATION_ compartments . similar to _PROTEIN_ subunits dynamins assemble on _LOCATION_ surfaces and are able to scaffold _LOCATION_ into cylinders . it is known that dynamins bind the cytoplasmic side of the neck upon endocytosis . endocytosis is a budding process into the cytoplasm and reverse to the process mediated by the _PROTEIN_ iii machinery which buds away from the cytoplasm . nevertheless we find that dynamins are interacting with the _PROTEIN_ iii subunit _PROTEIN_ . therefore we propose that _PROTEIN_ iii and dynamins assemble together on _LOCATION_ domains that have been modified by thereby supporting _LOCATION_ narrowing and lipid rearrangements at the neck of budding vesicles away from the cytoplasm . it is possible that dynamins bind to the inner side of the _PROTEIN_ machinery induced neck which is acidified by _PROTEIN_ and therefore serves as landing platform for the basic surface of _PROTEIN_ iii subunits . this _LOCATION_ association might support _LOCATION_ narrowing and lipid rearrangements at the neck of budding vesicles away from the cytoplasm so that _LOCATION_ fission and fusion occurs . since _METHOD_ interacts also with other _PROTEIN_ iii components we propose that at least in plants the large _LOCATION_ scaffolding complex consists of a mixture of and the associated _PROTEIN_ and proteins .
