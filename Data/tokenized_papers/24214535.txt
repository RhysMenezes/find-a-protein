oil bodies are intracellular structures present in the seed and leaf cells of many land plants . seed oil bodies are known to function as storage compartments for lipids . however the physiological function of leaf oil bodies is unknown . here we show that leaf oil bodies function as subcellular _PROTEIN_ for the production of a stable phytoalexin in response to fungal infection and senescence . proteomic analysis of oil bodies prepared from arabidopsis leaves identified caleosin _PROTEIN_ and dioxygenase _PROTEIN_ . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were localized on the surface of oil bodies . infection with the pathogenic fungus colletotrichum higginsianum promoted the formation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ positive oil bodies in perilesional areas surrounding the site of infection . _PROTEIN_ catalyzes the reaction from linolenic acid to an unstable compound hydroperoxy octadecatrienoic acid . intriguingly a combination of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ produced a stable compound hydroxy octadecatrienoic acid from linolenic acid . this suggests that the colocalization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ on oil bodies might prevent the degradation of unstable hpot by efficiently converting hpot into the stable compound hot . we found that hot had antifungal activity against members of the genus colletotrichum and that infection with c. higginsianum induced hot production . these results defined hot as an arabidopsis phytoalexin . this study provides to our knowledge the first evidence that leaf oil bodies produce a phytoalexin under a pathological condition which suggests a new mechanism of plant defense .
to investigate the role of leaf oil bodies we first focused on the oil body protein to _PROTEIN_ of arabidopsis . _PROTEIN_ was present in senescent leaves but undetectable in green leaves suggesting that dying cells synthesize _PROTEIN_ . spherical oil bodies are observed in cytoplasm of the senescent leaf cells but not in chloroplasts suggesting that the oil bodies we focused on in this study were not related to _LOCATION_ of chloroplasts . to identify the molecular components of leaf oil bodies transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the control of the native _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were generated . immunoprecipitation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tagged oil bodies from senescent leaves of transgenic plants using anti _METHOD_ antibodies yielded two bands corresponding to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and endogenous _PROTEIN_ which were identified with an anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . _METHOD_ spectrometric analysis of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tagged oil bodies was performed in triplicate on the ltq orbitrap . in this study we especially focused on _PROTEIN_ with a high score . _PROTEIN_ was remarkably up regulated in senescent leaves as was _PROTEIN_ . as expected _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized to the leaf oil bodies . although _PROTEIN_ is thought to be a soluble _LOCATION_ protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was also detected on the leaf oil bodies . colocalization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ on leaf oil bodies was further demonstrated by the transient _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and by the transient _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . importantly these analyses identified _PROTEIN_ as a new oil body localized protein . infection of c. higginsianum which is pathogenic to arabidopsis resulted in the formation of lesions on leaves d after infection . _PROTEIN_ mrna began to accumulate d after infection with c. higginsianum and the levels increased significantly within d similar to the increase in _PROTEIN_ protein . _PROTEIN_ mrna also began to accumulate d after infection . these results indicated that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are inducible by fungal infection . we next examined the emergence of _PROTEIN_ positive and _PROTEIN_ positive oil bodies in greater detail after infection of c. higginsianum . leaves showed yellowing of the tissues surrounding the infected area d after infection . interestingly we found that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants was clearly limited to the yellowing perilesional areas but was not detected in areas where c. higginsianum proliferated . on the other hand transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ driven by the native _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were infected with c. higginsianum . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was detected both in the yellowing perilesional areas and in areas where c. higginsianum proliferated . by observation at higher resolution _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were detected on the surface of oil bodies of the perilesional cells . most of the nile red stained oil bodies had _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showing the colocalization of both proteins on the leaf oil bodies of the transgenic plants . the stainability of oil bodies with nile red shows that the oil bodies surrounded by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ contained neutral lipids including triacylglycerol . therefore the oil bodies are defined as normal leaf oil bodies but not lipid droplets derived from damaged _LOCATION_ . the _METHOD_ signals of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were not merged with those of _LOCATION_ indicating that the leaf oil bodies are not related to _LOCATION_ of _LOCATION_ . these results suggest that perilesional dying cells are involved in the active induction of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ on leaf oil bodies . the numbers of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ positive oil bodies and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ positive oil bodies were measured in a tissue section and the results are summarized in figure c and d respectively . few _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ positive oil bodies were detected in uninfected leaves or in the green areas outside of the yellowing perilesional areas . in the perilesional areas _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ positive oil bodies increased in density d after infection . on the other hand in the infected area although _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ positive oil bodies did not develop _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ positive oil bodies increased in density d after infection . these results indicated that the perilesional cells actively synthesized both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and deposited them on leaf oil bodies . the subcellular colocalization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ suggested that they may function together on the leaf oil bodies . to clarify the roles of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ recombinant proteins were synthesized and incubated with linolenic acid in vitro . the reaction products of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were examined by hplc . prior to the reaction linolenic acid produced a single peak however after incubation with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for h the linolenic acid peak _PROTEIN_ and a new peak was detected . was not present after the incubation of linolenic acid with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ alone . was identified as hydroxy octadecatrienoic acid by tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . these results indicated that the coordinated activity of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ resulted in the production of hot from linolenic acid . figure illustrates a possible pathway . the oxygenated fatty acid metabolite hot is one of the oxylipins . considering the _PROTEIN_ that typical plant oxylipins are synthesized within chloroplasts the oil body might be a novel subcellular site of oxylipin biosynthesis in plants . plant oxylipins are known to have a variety of biological activities and are involved in the defense against pathogens . we examined the potential antifungal activity of hot against the genus colletotrichum . infection of c. higginsianum resulted in the formation of lesions on leaves d after infection . treatment with hot strongly suppressed lesion formation by c. higginsianum and caused a _PROTEIN_ in the number of leaves forming lesions . additionally hot at clearly inhibited c. higginsianum spore germination . the activity of another species of colletotrichum that infects cucumber leaves colletotrichum orbiculare was also suppressed by hot at suggesting that hot has antifungal activity against the genus colletotrichum . furthermore hot reduced c. orbiculare spore germination in a dose dependent manner but linolenic acid was ineffective . the effective concentration of hot was comparable with that reported for other antifungal oxylipins . taken together these findings suggested that oil bodies may play a role in converting a nonantifungal compound into a stable antifungal compound . thus plants might have evolved an oil body mediated toxin production system to protect healthy tissues and young plants from fungal infection . to explore if hot is a phytoalexin which is synthesized de novo after the perception of stresses including pathogen infection we examined the induction of hot accumulation in response to c. higginsianum infection by using liquid chromatography _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . lc _METHOD_ analysis showed that the hot level in infected leaves was approximately fold higher than that in uninfected leaves . this result indicates that the stable oxylipin hot is a novel phytoalexin . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ and are involved in the production of hot in vivo we generated dioxygenase mutants including two _PROTEIN_ single mutant alleles _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ two single mutant alleles and two double mutant alleles _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the hot levels in these mutants were determined in the leaves before and after c. higginsianum infection . intriguingly a deficiency of _PROTEIN_ caused a significant reduction in the hot levels whereas a deficiency of did not . this result indicates that _PROTEIN_ but not contributes to the phytoalexin hot synthesis . we next examined the induction of hot synthesis during senescence . as expected from the up regulation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in response to senescence the hot level in senescent leaves was much higher than that in intact leaves . the results identified a hot level of approximately fresh weight . the hot level in senescent leaves of the _PROTEIN_ double mutant was orders of magnitude lower than that in senescent wild type leaves . the _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ no _PROTEIN_ mrna whereas the mutants _PROTEIN_ only a very small amount of mrna in senescent leaves . a deficiency in _PROTEIN_ caused a significant reduction of the hot levels in senescent leaves whereas a deficiency in did not . these results indicate that senescence and fungal infection both induce _PROTEIN_ dependent hot production . the in vitro data and these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ functions coordinately with _PROTEIN_ in the synthesis of the novel phytoalexin hot in response to fungal infection and senescence . we also generated the _PROTEIN_ mutant and determined the hot content in this mutant . in contrast to _PROTEIN_ mutants the _PROTEIN_ mutant exhibited no reduction of hot levels . arabidopsis has eight caleosin homologs including _PROTEIN_ . in addition one of the closely related homologs _PROTEIN_ is localized at oil bodies in arabidopsis leaves . hence the other homologs might compensate for the lack of _PROTEIN_ resulting in no reduction of the hot content in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . whereas caleosins could be related to hot production we can not eliminate the possibility that some other oil body proteins play the same role .
