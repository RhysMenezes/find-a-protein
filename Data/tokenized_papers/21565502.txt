chloroplast signals regulate hundreds of _LOCATION_ genes during development and in response to stress but little is known of the signals or signal transduction _METHOD_ of _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ signaling . in arabidopsis thaliana genetic studies using norflurazon an inhibitor of carotenoid biosynthesis have identified five gun genes implicating the tetrapyrrole pathway as a source of a retrograde signal . loss of function of any of these gun genes leads to increased _PROTEIN_ of photosynthesis associated _LOCATION_ genes when chloroplast development has been blocked by nf . here we present a new arabidopsis gain of function mutant with a similar phenotype . the mutant overexpresses the conserved _LOCATION_ ferrochelatase _PROTEIN_ . genetic and biochemical experiments demonstrate that increased flux through the heme branch of the _LOCATION_ tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway increases phang _PROTEIN_ . the second conserved plant ferrochelatase _PROTEIN_ colocalizes with _PROTEIN_ but _PROTEIN_ activity is unable to increase phang _PROTEIN_ in undeveloped _LOCATION_ . these data suggest a model in which heme specifically produced by _PROTEIN_ may be used as a retrograde signal to coordinate phang _PROTEIN_ with chloroplast development .
a previous genetic screen in arabidopsis identified mutations in five gun genes that caused the photosynthesis associated _LOCATION_ gene lhcb to still be _PROTEIN_ when chloroplast development had been blocked by norflurazon treatment . microarray analyses further indicated that hundreds of genes were misregulated in these mutants . _PROTEIN_ and encode proteins acting at the branchpoint between the chlorophyll and heme branches of the _LOCATION_ tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway . these mutants are defective in specific subunits of mg chelatase which synthesizes mg protoporphyrin ix from proto _PROTEIN_ in a protein that increases mg chelatase efficiency _PROTEIN_ or they are defective in heme catabolism _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ leading to the accumulation of heme . free heme negatively regulates the synthesis of aminolevulinic acid and reduces flux through the pathway . these and other studies led to the proposal that gun mutants block the accumulation of a negative signal in damaged _LOCATION_ with mgproto being the proposed signaling molecule . newer reports have both supported and _PROTEIN_ this model . in agreement with the model an arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ null mutant accumulates high levels of mgproto and has strong repression of lhcb and proto and mgproto can accumulate in the cytoplasm of nf treated arabidopsis cells . however improvements in tetrapyrrole analysis have shown that there is no bulk accumulation of mgproto in barley or of any tetrapyrrole species in arabidopsis when _LOCATION_ development is blocked with nf . instead mgproto and other tetrapyrrole pathway intermediates accumulate to lower levels as a result of downregulation of the pathway enzymes . in an attempt to resolve the conflicting information we performed a gain of function genetic screen in arabidopsis using activation tagging mutagenesis . one candidate with a dominant phenotype called was identified . to quantify the gun phenotype of we analyzed five phangs whose _PROTEIN_ is regulated by chloroplast development _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lhcb pc and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ of these phangs was dramatically lowered in nf treated wild type seedlings whose chloroplast development had been blocked whereas their _PROTEIN_ was much higher in _PROTEIN_ and . a similar pattern was observed for the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ encoded proteins rubisco large subunit _PROTEIN_ and pc respectively . in a t dna insertion was found kb from _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ causing an fold increase in both _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and total _LOCATION_ ferrochelatase activity . _PROTEIN_ can be induced up to fold by tobacco mosaic virus infection suggesting that _PROTEIN_ transcript levels in seedlings are well within physiological range . to confirm that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ caused the gun phenotype in we constructed stable arabidopsis transformants constitutively overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . using the reporter nf treated seedlings from of independent transformants tested positive for lhcb _PROTEIN_ . histochemical gus staining of nf treated _PROTEIN_ ox seedlings showed that lhcb was still _PROTEIN_ in the shoot tissue . we further studied three representative _PROTEIN_ ox lines that _PROTEIN_ detectable amounts of tagged _PROTEIN_ transcript and protein . phang _PROTEIN_ in these lines was comparable to the original gun mutants . the fe chelator dipyridyl which has been shown to reduce ferrochelatase activity in vivo completely abolished the gun phenotype of line . at the same time overexpression of a catalytically inactive variant of _PROTEIN_ was unable to induce _PROTEIN_ of phangs . together these data show that the increased _PROTEIN_ enzyme activity is responsible for the phenotype . the increase of _PROTEIN_ activity is expected to increase the synthesis of heme which has been shown to be a positive retrograde signal from mitochondria and _LOCATION_ in yeast and algae respectively . _PROTEIN_ activity may also increase phytochromobilin levels and affect phytochrome signaling but measurements of hypocotyl lengths in various light conditions suggested that _PROTEIN_ ox lines had a wild type phytochrome response . furthermore because blocking heme catabolism and phytochromobilin synthesis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ also increases phang _PROTEIN_ in nf treated seedlings heme may be a positive retrograde signal in plants . heme accumulation however is known to reduce tetrapyrrole synthesis by inhibiting glutamyl trna reductase enzyme activity and therefore reducing ala and chlorophyll synthesis . indeed the _PROTEIN_ ox lines had reduced chlorophyll levels suggesting that ala synthesis was inhibited or that proto was being shunted away by _PROTEIN_ from the chlorophyll branch of the pathway . to distinguish between increased heme synthesis versus the inhibition of ala and/or chlorophyll synthesis being responsible for the gun phenotype in _PROTEIN_ ox lines we used gabaculine an inhibitor of glutamate semialdehyde aminotransferase to reduce ala synthesis . consistent with a positive signaling role for heme phang _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ ox line was repressed by gab treatment and this effect was reversed by simultaneously feeding ala . increasing ala levels in nf treated seedlings by direct ala feeding or by overexpression of _LOCATION_ localized _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ha also increased phang _PROTEIN_ . if heme is a positive signal from _LOCATION_ then mutants defective in the early steps in the tetrapyrrole pathway should not have a gun phenotype . indeed phang _PROTEIN_ in nf treated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ / _PROTEIN_ double mutant or _PROTEIN_ mutants was comparable to wild type even though these mutations blocked the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway and led to chlorophyll deficiency . analysis of lines _PROTEIN_ truncated variants of _PROTEIN_ yhp ha lacking the n terminal _LOCATION_ localization signal _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ further supported the conclusion that heme synthesis rather than a reduction of ala and/or chlorophyll is responsible for phang _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ ox lines . phangs were still _PROTEIN_ in these lines when treated with nf but unlike in other gun mutants chlorophyll levels were increased . the ability of these _PROTEIN_ variants to uncouple gun signaling from tetrapyrrole synthesis inhibition may be due to their apparent mislocalization even though _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ha protein and increased ferrochelatase activity were still associated with _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . similar to an earlier report nf treated seedlings contained approximately of the total noncovalently bound heme as green seedlings likely as a result of the downregulation of ala synthesis and the tetrapyrrole pathway . of the lines tested only _PROTEIN_ mutants had significantly increased heme levels likely as a result of _PROTEIN_ heme catabolism in the _LOCATION_ . total heme levels remained unchanged when _PROTEIN_ was overexpressed raising the possibility that _PROTEIN_ contributes to a specific pool of heme that is responsible for phang _PROTEIN_ . plant genomes contain a second conserved _LOCATION_ ferrochelatase called _PROTEIN_ . like _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ was identified by its ability to complement an saccharomyces cerevisiae ferrochelatase mutant . although both proteins are localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and envelope _LOCATION_ their sequences and _PROTEIN_ profiles suggest functional differences . _PROTEIN_ contains a regulatory hydrophobic c terminal lhc motif associated with light harvesting complexes and is coregulated with photosynthetic genes . _PROTEIN_ however is _PROTEIN_ in all tissues and unlike _PROTEIN_ is induced by various stresses . to test whether the overexpression of _PROTEIN_ can also lead to a gun phenotype stable transgenic lines constitutively overexpressing full length _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or a truncated variant lacking the lhc domain _PROTEIN_ were constructed . using the reporter construct none of independent lines _PROTEIN_ lhcb more than wild type when treated with nf . four representative lines were studied further . none of the five phangs were _PROTEIN_ above wild type levels in nf treated lines overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ha . instead _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and lhcb were slightly repressed . similar to however _LOCATION_ ferrochelatase activity was still increased fold in nf treated _PROTEIN_ ox lines and . the extra repression of phangs may be due to increased _PROTEIN_ activity because line overexpressing a catalytically inactive _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ha enzyme mildly increased phang _PROTEIN_ . like _PROTEIN_ ox lines the _PROTEIN_ ox lines had reduced chlorophyll content but unchanged levels of total heme . analysis of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ overexpresser lines showed that most have a small increase in _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ transcripts suggesting that the _LOCATION_ may be compensating for increased heme synthesis . to determine whether the different functions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are conserved in plants we identified orthologs of the two genes in the monocot zea mays and overexpressed them in arabidopsis . z. mays has three ferrochelatases two _PROTEIN_ proteins and one _PROTEIN_ protein with and identities to their arabidopsis counterparts respectively . all three proteins accumulated in _LOCATION_ but only overexpression of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ increased phang _PROTEIN_ in nf treated seedlings . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ activity is unable to positively regulate phang _PROTEIN_ in nf treated seedlings and that the specific signaling function of _PROTEIN_ is conserved between monocots and dicots the two major groups of flowering plants . our results suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may synthesize physiologically distinct pools of heme from the same biosynthetic pathway . to explore this possibility we analyzed lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ protein driven by their native promoters . the _PROTEIN_ profiles matched earlier reports of their transcript profiles . whereas only _PROTEIN_ was detected in roots both proteins accumulated in green and nf treated shoot tissue with _PROTEIN_ being slightly induced and _PROTEIN_ being repressed in the latter condition . in both cases _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ colocalized to the same _LOCATION_ when _PROTEIN_ from their own promoters or overexpressed . moreover we demonstrated that swapping the different n terminal _LOCATION_ sorting signals between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ did not affect _LOCATION_ localization or change their impact on phang _PROTEIN_ . together these results suggest that the functional differences between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are not due to different tissue or subcellular localizations . we next measured the effect of loss of function ferrochelatase mutants on retrograde signaling . homozygous null mutants were not recovered from heterozygous parents suggesting an embryonic lethal phenotype . for these studies we used weak alleles of and that have reduced transcript levels . the two mutations resulted in opposite phenotypes with and seedlings being less or more responsive to ala feeding respectively compared to wild type . these results are consistent with both enzymes utilizing the same pathway to synthesize heme but with different effects on signaling . the increased phang _PROTEIN_ in may be due to increased proto substrate pools for _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ mutants also have increased levels of proto that may be used by _PROTEIN_ . indeed blocking all ferrochelatase activity with dp or the introduction of the but not the allele into _PROTEIN_ partially repressed phang _PROTEIN_ . furthermore similar to _PROTEIN_ ox lines phang _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mutants was reduced by gab treatment . the weaker effect of gab on _PROTEIN_ mutants may be due to its overall stronger gun phenotype or that proto levels are sufficiently increased in this line . together these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ mutants may be increasing _PROTEIN_ produced heme by blocking the mg branch of the pathway .
