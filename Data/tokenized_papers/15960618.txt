_PROTEIN_ are a class of secondary metabolites with important roles in plant defense and human nutrition . to uncover regulatory _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ production we screened arabidopsis thaliana t dna activation tagged lines and identified a high _PROTEIN_ mutant caused by overexpression of _PROTEIN_ . a series of gain and loss of function _PROTEIN_ alleles in different accessions correlates with increased and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels respectively . _PROTEIN_ encodes a novel protein that contains putative _LOCATION_ localization signals and several motifs known to mediate calmodulin binding which are arranged in a plant specific segment of amino acids called the domain . we demonstrate that an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein is targeted to the cell _LOCATION_ and that recombinant _PROTEIN_ binds to calmodulin in a dependent fashion . analysis of steady state messenger rna levels of _PROTEIN_ pathway genes indicates that _PROTEIN_ affects _PROTEIN_ of multiple genes with roles in _PROTEIN_ metabolism . histochemical analysis of tissue specific _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ reveals _PROTEIN_ promoter activity _PROTEIN_ in vascular tissues of all organs consistent with the _PROTEIN_ patterns of several _PROTEIN_ related genes . interestingly overexpression of _PROTEIN_ reduces insect herbivory which we demonstrated in dual choice assays with the generalist phloem feeding green peach aphid and in weight gain assays with the cabbage looper a generalist chewing lepidopteran . as _PROTEIN_ is induced by mechanical stimuli we propose _PROTEIN_ to be novel _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ that integrates intracellular signals to fine tune _PROTEIN_ accumulation in response to biotic _PROTEIN_ .
we previously developed a bioassay for leaf _PROTEIN_ content in arabidopsis that is based on the induction of quinone reductase activity in cultured murine hepatoma cells by isothiocyanates produced from _PROTEIN_ during plant tissue destruction . we observed a positive correlation between leaf qr inducer potency and leaf _PROTEIN_ content for a. thaliana and demonstrated the feasibility to identify chemically induced mutants with altered _PROTEIN_ profiles . we further showed that excised leaf disks can substitute for cell free leaf extracts as a source of _PROTEIN_ derived isothiocyanates which facilitates high through put screening of insertional mutant collections . here we screened duplicate leaf disks of progeny derived from independent t dna activation tagged lines for altered leaf qr inducer potency . we identified putative mutants that were retested in the generation . leaf material of progeny that inherited changes in qr inducer potency were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography for _PROTEIN_ profiles . we identified _PROTEIN_ content and composition lines with an altered _PROTEIN_ chemotype that passed the three stage screening procedure . line the focus of this study accumulates about twice as much methionine and tryptophan derived _PROTEIN_ as wild type control seedlings . methylsulfinylpropyl methylsulfinylbutyl methylsulfinyloctyl methylthiobutyl oh hydroxypropyl _PROTEIN_ indole ylmethyl methoxyindole ylmethyl methoxyindole ylmethyl nd not detectable . athe desulfoglucosinolate fraction extracted from shoots of day old seedlings was analyzed by hplc . bglucosinolate concentrations are given in nmol fw sd . the t dna vector used for activation mutagenesis contains four repeats of the enhancer region of the constitutively active promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus and the bar gene for phosphinotricin resistance in the t dna insert . introduction of this t dna into the genome can cause increased gene _PROTEIN_ near the integration site in an orientation independent manner . analysis of the and generation of line demonstrated glufosinate resistance of all progeny and a heritable high _PROTEIN_ chemotype . to test whether the high _PROTEIN_ chemotype is linked to the t dna insert we backcrossed line to wild type and analyzed the and selfed progeny for glufosinate resistance and _PROTEIN_ accumulation . all analyzed progeny were glufosinate resistant and accumulated about more total _PROTEIN_ than wild type plants . the backcross generation segregated in a ratio for both glufosinate resistance and the high _PROTEIN_ chemotype _PROTEIN_ . the t dna was present in all mutant plants but absent in the wild type segregants . these data are consistent with the presence of a single t dna insert conferring glufosinate resistance and a semi dominant high _PROTEIN_ chemotype . we further performed southern analysis on genomic dna prepared from plants and digested with the restriction enzymes available for plasmid rescue in the activation tagging vector . hybridization of a t dna specific gene probe to only one fragment of each dna digest revealed a single t dna insertion event for line there was no indication for rearrangement of the t dna insert . the dominance of the high _PROTEIN_ chemotype indicated that the mutation most likely resulted from increased gene _PROTEIN_ driven by multiple enhancers in the single t dna insert . we recovered genomic dna fragments flanking the t dna in line by plasmid rescue which we analyzed by restriction mapping and dna sequencing of kb across the left t dna border . figure shows the structure of the t dna insertion site in the genomic region covered by bac of chromosome . the t dna inserted into putative exon of gene which is predicted to encode an rna helicase . several gene candidates encoding proteins of unknown or hypothetical function are located adjacent to the left and right border of the t dna insert . analysis of messenger rna _PROTEIN_ by semiquantitative rt pcr demonstrated a robust overexpression of _GENE_ located kb next to the left t dna border in line relative to the wild type control . on the contrary steady state mrna _PROTEIN_ levels of the distal genes and were not affected in line and indistinguishable from wild type levels while _PROTEIN_ of was only modestly reduced . these data suggest that the high _PROTEIN_ chemotype of line is caused by constitutive overexpression of _GENE_ which is hereafter referred to as _PROTEIN_ . to evaluate a proposed function of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ accumulation we analyzed five publicly available insertional mutations and generated transgenic recapitulation as well as antisense suppression lines . as expected t dna insertions into does not affect _PROTEIN_ accumulation which is also true for line . by contrast _PROTEIN_ concentrations are significantly reduced for _PROTEIN_ promoter insertion lines _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as well as for line which harbors a t dna insert in the fourth exon of the predicted _PROTEIN_ open reading frame and for an antisense suppression line . when compared with the respective wild type accessions methionine derived _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ by as much as whereas tryptophan derived _PROTEIN_ are reduced to a lesser extent . the reduction in _PROTEIN_ content correlated with reduced _PROTEIN_ or undetectable levels of _PROTEIN_ transcripts . finally we generated recapitulation lines _PROTEIN_ that accumulate more total _PROTEIN_ . this observation supports genetic data indicating that the high _PROTEIN_ chemotype of line is caused by overexpression of _PROTEIN_ and not by gene disruption of . thus the analysis of loss and gain of function alleles suggests that _PROTEIN_ encodes a modifier of _PROTEIN_ accumulation . although _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants are smaller than wild type at an early growth stage they are very similar to wild type in appearance when mature . loss of function _PROTEIN_ alleles in the ler background _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are slightly stunted which is not observed for line in the ws background . when compared with wild type seeds total _PROTEIN_ content of seeds is about twofold higher indicating that the high _PROTEIN_ chemotype of is independent of the developmental stage and caused by increased _PROTEIN_ production . conceptual translation of the _PROTEIN_ open reading frame predicts _PROTEIN_ of a basic protein with a molecular _METHOD_ of kda . we constructed a full length _PROTEIN_ cdna and confirmed the predicted _PROTEIN_ gene model . a blast search with the primary structure of _PROTEIN_ as the query identified closely related hypothetical proteins five in arabidopsis one in sunflower and five in rice . these proteins share similar molecular _METHOD_ and isoelectric points . in addition to their basic nature _PROTEIN_ related proteins are ser/thr rich . the amino acid and nucleotide sequence identity among the genes varies from to and to respectively indicating that _PROTEIN_ like genes are quite divergent . blast searches with lower stringency suggest the presence of and at least related genes in the genomes of a. thaliana and oryza sativa respectively . as shown in figure sequence similarity among _PROTEIN_ related polypeptides is primarily limited to their central portion which contains three segments of high amino acid sequence conservation . secondary structure predictions suggest that the three segments contribute to helical folds . the _PROTEIN_ like proteins are predicted to consist primarily of random coil structures helices and to a lesser extent of strands . multiple repeats of three different classes of recognition motifs for calmodulin interaction are present in segment i and separated by invariant spacing . this segment of amino acid residues contains two to three copies of the iq motif iqxxxrgxxxr or of its more relaxed version qxxxrxxxx . the iq motif was initially thought to mediate independent retention of calmodulin although the motif was subsequently found to be present in some proteins that interact with calmodulin in a dependent manner . segment i also contains two repeats of the motif as well as three repeats of the motif at conserved positions which partially overlap with the iq motifs . the and motifs mediate dependent calmodulin binding and were named based on the conserved spacing of hydrophobic residues . another hallmark of _PROTEIN_ related proteins is the presence of clusters of basic amino acid residues that satisfy structural characteristics of three classes of _LOCATION_ localization signals . as indicated in figure the n and c terminal regions of _PROTEIN_ related proteins contain several basic clusters that conform to the type type and bipartite type of _LOCATION_ localization signals . thus the prospect arises that _PROTEIN_ binds to calmodulin and functions in the cell _LOCATION_ . to test whether recombinant _PROTEIN_ binds to calmodulin we _PROTEIN_ an epitope tagged _PROTEIN_ fusion protein in escherichia coli . crude extract from induced bacterial cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was used in pull down assays with bovine calmodulin agarose beads in the presence of or in the absence of . after co incubation of the calmodulin agarose beads with bacterial extract the beads were repeatedly washed and bound proteins were eluted by suspension in sample loading buffer . proteins of all fractions were separated by electrophoresis transferred to a _LOCATION_ and probed with tag antibody to detect the _PROTEIN_ fusion protein . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ co sedimented with calmodulin agarose beads only in the presence of but did not co sediment when the incubation mix and wash buffer were supplemented with egta . we used recombinant _PROTEIN_ as a negative control which did not bind to calmodulin agarose beads . thus our data suggest dependent but epitope independent calmodulin binding of _PROTEIN_ in vitro . to study the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ in vivo we generated transgenic arabidopsis lines that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein under control of the constitutive camv promoter . as expected histochemical analysis revealed localization of the authentic _METHOD_ protein in the _LOCATION_ and cell _LOCATION_ whereas the chimeric _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein accumulated _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ and was largely excluded from the _LOCATION_ . thus our data demonstrate the potential for _LOCATION_ localization of an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein when stably _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis and therefore suggest the cell _LOCATION_ as a cellular compartment of _PROTEIN_ function . we used reverse transcriptase mediated pcr to monitor steady state mrna levels of several genes encoding enzymes involved in _PROTEIN_ metabolism . several of these genes are members of closely related families and are _PROTEIN_ at low levels which precluded rna blot analysis . both semiquantitative and real time rt pcr were performed on rna isolated from shoots of day old seedlings and relative mrna levels were compared between columbia wild type line and the _PROTEIN_ recapitulation line . relative to wild type steady state mrna levels for genes with roles in trp derived _PROTEIN_ biosynthesis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were elevated in line most notably for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . however _PROTEIN_ levels of genes encoding enzymes related to the biosynthesis of met derived _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ degradation _PROTEIN_ were appreciably _PROTEIN_ whereas _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was only twofold reduced . the same tendency of altered gene _PROTEIN_ was observed in the _PROTEIN_ recapitulation line . thus our data suggest that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ deregulates at least a subset of _PROTEIN_ pathway genes . tissue specific _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was tested by semiquantitative rt pcr with rna extracted from to day old plants and was found to be present in the all major organs tested . in our search for insertional loss of function _PROTEIN_ alleles we identified one gene trap line of the csh collection _PROTEIN_ in which the bacterial _PROTEIN_ gene uida under control of a minimal promoter is inserted bp upstream of the predicted translational start codon of _PROTEIN_ . therefore although the transcriptional start site of _PROTEIN_ has not been determined line _PROTEIN_ likely reports authentic _PROTEIN_ promoter activity . histochemical analysis of gus activity in up to week old _PROTEIN_ seedlings revealed reporter gene _PROTEIN_ exclusively in the vascular bundles of hypocotyls leaves _METHOD_ flowers and roots . in day old germinating seedlings gus _PROTEIN_ is detected in the shoot apical meristem at the branching zone of the vascular tissue beneath the meristem and in the vasculature of the hypocotyls and roots . at day and day gus _PROTEIN_ is clearly detectable in the vascular tissues of rosette leaves and of the root system weaker _PROTEIN_ is observed in the cotyledons . the highest level of _PROTEIN_ promoter activity was observed in fully expanded rosette leaves and shoot _METHOD_ of non flowering seedlings . gus _PROTEIN_ in roots was excluded from the elongation zone . gus is also _PROTEIN_ at the receptacle of the flower and silique in developing seeds seed funicles the pistil and stamen filaments . during the transition from vegetative to reproductive development gus _PROTEIN_ gradually diminishes in rosette leaves but is clearly detectable in the developing inflorescence and flower buds _PROTEIN_ in the root system appears unaffected . it is interesting to note that the observed tissue specific pattern of _PROTEIN_ promoter activity is strikingly similar to the _PROTEIN_ patterns reported for several genes that encode enzymes of the _PROTEIN_ synthesis pathway _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . we occasionally observed that loss of function _PROTEIN_ mutants are more susceptible to insect attack when grown in soil which prompted us to analyze the effect of altered _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ on insect herbivory in more detail . herbivory induced tissue damage causes _PROTEIN_ degradation and release of bioactive products that may act as attractants and oviposition stimulants for specialist or as repellents against generalist insects . in a first set of experiments we examined and compared the weight gain of newly hatched larvae of the cabbage looper a generalist lepidopteran whose larvae feed on cruciferous and many other plant species . we observed that t. ni larvae developing on line were significantly smaller and gained less fresh weight than larvae on wild type plants which were appreciably more damaged by herbivory than plants . we did not observe a significant weight difference between t. ni larvae grown on and control plants . however the fresh weight of larvae developing on both ws lines was about higher than the weight of larvae developing on col wild type plants which may be explained by the different _PROTEIN_ composition and the different types of _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis products formed in both accessions . it has been reported that nitrile producing a. thaliana accessions such as ws are more susceptible to t. ni herbivory than isothiocyanate producing lines such as col . in a second experiment we investigated the nymph deposition preference of the green peach aphid a generalist phloem feeding pest with hosts in over plant families . in dual choice assays we placed individual _PROTEIN_ instars of alate aphids which mature into winged adults onto the surface of agar plates containing two seedlings of different _PROTEIN_ chemotypes and scored host plant preference through an analysis of nymph deposition . our data show that green peach aphids consistently avoided the line with the higher _PROTEIN_ content . for each of the two choice arrangements about two thirds of the aphids preferred the lower _PROTEIN_ line for reproduction i.e. wild type col and _PROTEIN_ loss of function line . in summary our data demonstrate that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ significantly reduces herbivory by chewing and phloem feeding insects . treatment of arabidopsis plants with ja sa and ethylene leads to the accumulation of specific _PROTEIN_ . as overexpression of _PROTEIN_ causes elevated _PROTEIN_ levels we examined whether _PROTEIN_ mrna _PROTEIN_ is responsive to ja sa the ethylene precursor acc or iaa . none of the plant hormones tested appreciably altered steady state _PROTEIN_ mrna levels when externally applied which was confirmed by quantitative rt pcr for plants treated at different developmental stages . induction of _PROTEIN_ by sa and of _PROTEIN_ by ja and ethylene confirmed effective hormone treatment . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ mrna levels are also unaffected in various mutants defective in hormone synthesis or signaling _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is independent of these hormones . however we noticed that mock spraying of seedlings with the solvent control or water alone caused a modest about twofold elevation of _PROTEIN_ mrna levels which was also observed after mechanical wounding of leaves or after infestation of seedlings with green peach aphids . increased _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as a result of aphid herbivory is likely a consequence of both mechanical stimulation and responses to chemical cues generated during phloem feeding .

ten microliters of the pcr was analyzed by gel electrophoresis on a agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining . specific primers were used as a control for the amount of template cdna . rt pcr reactions were performed at least twice with independent rna preparations . for real time rt pcr analyses the resulting cdna was diluted fold and was used as template . reactions were performed

respect to actin transcript levels _METHOD_ . gene specific amplimers for semiquantitative and quantitative rt pcr are listed in table . a full length cdna fragment encoding the predicted _PROTEIN_ protein was generated by rt pcr using gene specific primers f _PROTEIN_ and r . the pcr fragment was subcloned into the ta cloning vector pgemt creating plasmid pgemt _PROTEIN_ . after verifying the authenticity of the insert by dna sequencing the _PROTEIN_ cdna fragment was mobilized into the ecori site of vector which provides an n terminal epitope tag masmtggqqmg . the orientation of the insert in plasmid _PROTEIN_ was verified by restriction enzyme analysis . the recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein was _PROTEIN_ in e. coli at for h by induction with mm isopropyl d thiogalactopyranoside .

washing buffer were mixed with of bacterial supernatant supplemented with mm or mm egta and incubated for h at under gentle shaking . calmodulin agarose beads were sedimented by centrifugation and

tag monoclonal antibody conjugated with horse radish peroxidase for h at . after washing the _LOCATION_ with ttbs buffer for min signals were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence system . to generate _PROTEIN_ overexpression and antisense transgenic lines the xbai noti fragment of plasmid _PROTEIN_ was mobilized into a _PROTEIN_ derived binary plant transformation vector to drive _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ cdna or of its antisense orientation under control of the camv promoter . for transgenic _PROTEIN_ of translational _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions the ecori smai fragment of pgemt
