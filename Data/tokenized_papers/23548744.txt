phytochrome interacting _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is a key basic helix loop helix transcription _PROTEIN_ of arabidopsis thaliana that negatively regulates light responses repressing chlorophyll biosynthesis photosynthesis and photomorphogenesis in the dark . however the mechanism for the _PROTEIN_ mediated transcription regulation remains largely unknown . in this study we found that the reduced potassium _PROTEIN_ type histone deacetylase _PROTEIN_ directly interacted with _PROTEIN_ in vivo and in vitro . genome wide transcriptome analysis revealed that _PROTEIN_ acts _PROTEIN_ as a transcriptional repressor and negatively regulates chlorophyll biosynthesis and photosynthesis gene _PROTEIN_ in etiolated seedlings . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cotarget to the genes involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis and photosynthesis in the dark and repress gene _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ the acetylation levels and rna polymerase ii associated transcription . the binding of _PROTEIN_ to the target genes depends on the presence of _PROTEIN_ . in addition _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are dissociated from the target genes upon exposure to red light . taken together our results indicate that _PROTEIN_ associates with _PROTEIN_ to repress chlorophyll biosynthetic and photosynthetic genes in etiolated seedlings .
it was reported that _PROTEIN_ may act as a negative regulator in the gene _PROTEIN_ involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis and photosynthesis . many transcription repressors were found to regulate their target genes by recruiting hdacs . therefore we examined whether _PROTEIN_ could directly interact with the hdacs by yeast two hybrid assays . we found that _PROTEIN_ directly interacted with a type hdac _PROTEIN_ but not other hdacs in yeast cells . further deletion analyses identified that the n terminal domain of _PROTEIN_ and the n terminal domain of _PROTEIN_ were responsible for their interaction in yeast cells . by contrast _PROTEIN_ did not interact with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in yeast cells . these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ specifically interacts with _PROTEIN_ . we further analyzed the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ by pull down assays . purified _PROTEIN_ his recombinant protein was incubated with glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein . _PROTEIN_ his was pulled down by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . furthermore _PROTEIN_ his recombinant protein was also incubated with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ from total protein extracts of etiolated seedlings . in vivo _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein was also pulled down by recombinant _PROTEIN_ his . these data also support that _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ . the interaction of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was further studied in vivo by the bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation assay . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were fused to the n terminal amino acid portion of yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ in the _GENE_ vector and c terminal amino acid portion of _METHOD_ in the _GENE_ vector respectively . the constructs were codelivered into arabidopsis protoplasts and then incubated in darkness or under red light for h. strong _METHOD_ signal was observed in the _LOCATION_ of dark incubated arabidopsis protoplasts while no obvious signal was detected in the protoplasts incubated under rl conditions suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interact in dark conditions only . the corresponding fusion gene constructs were also codelivered into tobacco leaves by infiltration with agrobacterium tumefaciens . the direct interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was also observed in the _LOCATION_ of tobacco epidermal cells in dark . we also performed coimmunoprecipitation assays in _PROTEIN_ myc transgenic plants . _PROTEIN_ myc was coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous _PROTEIN_ in d old etiolated seedlings . however this interaction became weaker when the seedlings were exposed to rl for min and almost disappeared after h rl exposure . taken together our data suggest that _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ only in dark conditions in arabidopsis . recombinant _PROTEIN_ produced in escherichia coli did not show measurable hdac activity . therefore we purified _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ from d old etiolated seedlings or seedlings transferred to rl light for h using transgenic arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ chimeric gene driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . a prominent polypeptide migrated on a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gel at the predicted size of kd and was absent in nontransgenic and _METHOD_ plants . hdac activities were evaluated using a colorimetric assay . the hela _LOCATION_ extract that contains a blend of hdacs served as the positive control while the hdac inhibitor trichostatin a _PROTEIN_ was also added to demonstrate the specificity of deacetylation activities . as shown in figure purified _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein from both etiolated seedlings and seedlings exposed to rl clearly showed the hdac activity . these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ has hdac activity and that the activity is not affected by light . we also used _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants to examine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ . we observed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein was localized in the _LOCATION_ of d old etiolated seedlings both in dark and white light conditions . when etiolated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ seedlings were transferred to rl for or min the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins were also localized in the _LOCATION_ . these data indicated that _PROTEIN_ is constitutively localized in the _LOCATION_ in both dark and light conditions in arabidopsis seedlings . a previous study indicated that _PROTEIN_ can undergo the _LOCATION_ cytoplasm shuttling driven by light in arabidopsis protoplasts using a transient assay suggesting that _PROTEIN_ may also be localized in the cytoplasm under different conditions . to further investigate the function of _PROTEIN_ a t dna insertion mutant _PROTEIN_ and two rna interference lines were analyzed . the t dna was inserted in the second exon of _PROTEIN_ and no _PROTEIN_ transcript was detected in the homozygous _PROTEIN_ plants . furthermore the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ mrna in the two rnai lines and was markedly _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type . we also generated the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants by crossing _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to investigate the genetic interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the protochlorophyllide contents in etiolated _PROTEIN_ and rnai plants were measured . etiolated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ rnai seedlings accumulated a relative higher amount of protochlorophyllide compared with the wild type suggesting that _PROTEIN_ may negatively regulate protochlorophyllide biosynthesis in the dark . etiolated seedlings that accumulate abnormally high levels of chlorophyll intermediates are bleached when transferred to the light . we grew columbia wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ for several days in the dark and then transferred into white light . the greening rate of _PROTEIN_ was lower than that of the wild type after d or longer of dark treatment . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant showed an even lower greening rate compared with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutants with almost all the seedlings became bleached when grew d or longer in the dark . these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ mutants accumulate a higher level of chlorophyll intermediates than the wild type . the observed phenotype prompted us to test whether _PROTEIN_ regulates the _PROTEIN_ of the genes involved in the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ encode the _PROTEIN_ d and _PROTEIN_ h subunit of the chelatase enzyme complex the first enzyme in the chlorophyll biosynthetic branch in the tetrapyrrole pathway whereas _PROTEIN_ encodes a putative di iron enzyme that is required for the biosynthesis of protochlorophyllide from mg protoporphyrin ix me . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and crd was upregulated in the d etiolated seedlings of _PROTEIN_ mutants compared with the wild type suggesting that _PROTEIN_ may repress the _PROTEIN_ of the chlorophyll biosynthetic genes . the upregulation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ indicated that _PROTEIN_ may repress the conversion from protoporphyrin ix to protochlorophyllide in the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway . a recent study suggested that _PROTEIN_ may act as a negative regulator of chlorophyll biosynthesis by repressing genes required for chlorophyll biosynthesis such as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the dark . we further compared the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in etiolated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants . compared with the wild type the transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were all increased in d etiolated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and double mutants . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants showed highest _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which is in accordance with the relatively high amount of protochlorophyllide in etiolated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings . these data indicate that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ repress the gene _PROTEIN_ involved in chlorophyll biosynthetic pathways . to further explore the roles of _PROTEIN_ in etiolated seedlings we analyzed the global gene _PROTEIN_ profiles of d old etiolated _PROTEIN_ seedlings using an affymetrix microarray _PROTEIN_ . compared with the wild type genes were upregulated but only genes were downregulated in _PROTEIN_ seedlings suggesting that _PROTEIN_ may act _PROTEIN_ as a transcriptional repressor in etiolated seedlings . the genes affected by the _PROTEIN_ mutation are involved in a variety of biological processes including the following gene ontology categories metabolic process transcription response to stimulus photosynthesis transport protein phosphorylation biosynthetic process developmental process translation cellular process and _LOCATION_ acid metabolic process indicating that _PROTEIN_ plays important roles in regulation of growth and developmental processes in arabidopsis . we compared the gene _PROTEIN_ profiles of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ quadruple mutants . of the induced genes in _PROTEIN_ genes were also upregulated in the pifq mutant . most of the light responsive genes regulated by _PROTEIN_ were also upregulated in etiolated pifq mutants . the transcripts of a large subset of photosynthetic genes were elevated in _PROTEIN_ including _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ encode the subunits of photosystem i whereas the others encode the subunits of light harvesting complexes of _METHOD_ i and ii . the _PROTEIN_ patterns of these genes were further confirmed by quantitative rt pcr . we also analyzed the transcript levels of some of the _PROTEIN_ regulated light responsive genes in etiolated _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings . similar to _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was also upregulated in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings . compared with the single mutants increased _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants was observed suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may act synergistically in the regulation of gene _PROTEIN_ . taken together these data suggested that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function as repressors of photosynthetic genes in etiolated seedlings . to evaluate whether the high _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings is related to histone modifications we determined the histone acetylation levels of these genes by _PROTEIN_ assays . the histone acetylation levels of the promoters and exons of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and were elevated in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants . by contrast the _LOCATION_ occupancy of these genes was not changed . these data suggest that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may repress gene _PROTEIN_ by deceasing histone acetylation levels . we further analyzed rna polymerase ii occupancy on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and in etiolated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants by _PROTEIN_ assays using an anti rnapii antibody . a relatively higher enrichment of rnapii binding to the transcriptional starting sites and exons was observed in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants compared with the wild type suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ repress rnapii associated transcription in etiolated seedlings . taken together our data indicate that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ repress the transcription of chlorophyll biosynthetic and photosynthetic genes by _PROTEIN_ histone acetylation and rnapii associated transcription in etiolated seedlings . genome wide transcription and _PROTEIN_ analysis revealed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ coregulate a large subset of chlorophyll biosynthetic and photosynthetic genes . to examine whether these genes are direct targets of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ assays were performed using transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ myc tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and myc tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ myc in _PROTEIN_ can complement the protochlorophyllide defect phenotype suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ myc protein is functional in vivo . _PROTEIN_ analyses in etiolated _PROTEIN_ myc and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings showed that _PROTEIN_ specifically bound to the g box regions of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and in etiolated seedlings . similar to a previous study we also found that _PROTEIN_ bound to the promoter of _PROTEIN_ . furthermore the g box regions of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and were also direct binding sites of _PROTEIN_ . as a control we analyzed _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ two unrelated genes upregulated in _PROTEIN_ based on the microarray and qrt pcr analysis . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were not direct binding targets of _PROTEIN_ . these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may specifically cotarget to the promoters of chlorophyll biosynthetic and photosynthetic genes in etiolated seedlings . to further investigate whether the binding of _PROTEIN_ to the target genes is dependent on the presence of _PROTEIN_ we performed _PROTEIN_ assays with an anti _PROTEIN_ antibody using d old etiolated col _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings . much lower enrichment of _PROTEIN_ protein in the promoters of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and was detected in _PROTEIN_ seedlings compared with the wild type confirming that these genes are the direct targets of _PROTEIN_ . furthermore relatively lower enrichment of _PROTEIN_ protein in the promoters of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and was also detected in _PROTEIN_ suggesting that the association of _PROTEIN_ with the promoters of light responsive genes is dependent on _PROTEIN_ . previous studies showed that light triggers activated _METHOD_ of phytochromes and induces rapid phosphorylation and degradation of _PROTEIN_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ and its interacting proteins may be disassociated from their target genes upon exposure to light . we analyzed the binding of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to their target genes during seedling deetiolation . we first checked the protein levels of _PROTEIN_ myc and _PROTEIN_ myc in the transgenic lines grown for d in darkness and then exposed to rl . the protein level of _PROTEIN_ was not changed suggesting that _PROTEIN_ protein was stable during dark to light conversion . in _PROTEIN_ myc transgenic plants a band of a larger molecular _METHOD_ appeared immediately after rp exposure which may represent the phosphorylated form of _PROTEIN_ . the phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ was degraded h after transfer to rl . we used _PROTEIN_ assays to examine whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ could still bind to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ when etiolated seedlings were exposed to rl . compared with the strong binding of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to the promoters of the target genes in dark grown seedlings there was no difference in the relative enrichment of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ among the transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants after h rl exposure suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins were dissociated from the target genes after light exposure . we also detected the _PROTEIN_ levels of the early light inducible genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in wild type seedlings after rl exposure . the transcription of these genes was upregulated after transfer to rl for h . _PROTEIN_ analysis showed that and acetylation levels in the promoters of these genes were enriched after h rl . collectively our data suggest that light dissociates _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from their target genes resulting in increased histone acetylation and gene _PROTEIN_ . we further studied the phenotype of _PROTEIN_ mutants under various light conditions . phenotypic analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ rnai seedlings exhibited relative longer hypocotyls than the wild type under rl and fr conditions indicating that _PROTEIN_ might positively regulate _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mediated inhibition of hypocotyl elongation . previous studies demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ is a negative regulator of _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ mediated inhibition of hypocotyl elongation . we further studied whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interact genetically to regulate hypocotyl elongation under various light conditions . similar to the results from previous studies the _PROTEIN_ mutants had shorter hypocotyls under rl compared with the wild type . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants showed an intermediate hypocotyl length compared with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings under rl suggesting that _PROTEIN_ might act independently of _PROTEIN_ in regulation of _PROTEIN_ mediated inhibition of hypocotyl elongation . when grown under fr the hypocotyl length of _PROTEIN_ was similar to that of the wild type whereas the hypocotyl length of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was similar to that of _PROTEIN_ . taken together these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may independently regulate hypocotyl elongation in seedlings growth . a previous study showed that mutations of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis resulted in a short hypocotyl phenotype under rl and fr indicating a negative role of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mediated inhibition of hypocotyl elongation . we generated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants by genetic crossing _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings showed intermediate hypocotyl lengths compared with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutants under rl and fr conditions suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may act antagonistically in regulation of hypocotyl elongation . these data suggest that different hdacs may have distinct functions in hypocotyl growth .
