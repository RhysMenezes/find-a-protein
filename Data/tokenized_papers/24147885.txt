during cytokinesis a new crosswall is rapidly laid down . this process involves the formation at the cell equator of a tubulo vesicular _LOCATION_ network . this tvn evolves into a tubular network and a planar fenestrated sheet which extends at its periphery before fusing to the mother cell wall . the role of cell wall polymers in cell plate assembly is poorly understood . we used specific stains and _METHOD_ labelled cellulose synthases _PROTEIN_ to show that cellulose as well as three distinct _PROTEIN_ accumulated in the cell plate already at the tvn stage . this early presence suggests that cellulose is extruded into the tubular _LOCATION_ structures of the tvn . co localisation studies using _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ suggest the delivery of cellulose synthase complexes to the cell plate via phragmoplast associated vesicles . in the more mature tn part of the cell plate we observed delivery of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ from doughnut shaped organelles presumably _LOCATION_ bodies . during the conversion of the tn into a planar fenestrated sheet the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ density diminished whereas _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ levels remained high in the tvn zone at the periphery of the expanding cell plate . we observed retrieval of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in clathrin containing structures from the central zone of the cell plate and from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of the mother cell which may contribute to the recycling of _PROTEIN_ to the peripheral growth zone of the cell plate . these observations together with mutant phenotypes of cellulose deficient mutants and pharmacological experiments suggest a key role for cellulose synthesis already at early stages of cell plate assembly .
the cellulose synthase catalytic subunit _PROTEIN_ is required for cytokinesis as shown by the presence of incomplete cell plates in loss of function mutants . to study the subcellular localisation of this protein in dividing cells we _PROTEIN_ a green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein from its own promoter in a _PROTEIN_ mutant background . this construct complemented the mutant phenotype and hence is functional . we studied the localisation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in cortical and epidermal cells of day old roots using laser scanning confocal microscopy after staining of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and developing cell plate with the styryl dye . in interphase cells _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was present in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and in different subcellular compartments . the doughnut shaped _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ organelles were previously identified as _LOCATION_ stacks . in dividing cells _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was strongly enriched in mature cell plates as compared with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of the mother cells indicating the existence of a mechanism that selectively concentrates cscs to the cell plate in dividing cells . to further investigate this finding we followed the presence of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ during cell plate formation . interestingly _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was already present at early stages of cell plate formation and further accumulated at the periphery of the growing cell plate . the composition of cscs can change during development and it is not known whether the two other primary cell wall cellulose synthases _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are also required in cell plate formation since no cytokinesis defects were observed in the respective partial loss of function mutants . we therefore studied the localisation of the respective _METHOD_ fusion proteins . interestingly both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ from their own upstream regions showed accumulation patterns similar to those of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ suggesting that the cell plate associated cscs like those present in interphase cells comprise all three subunits . to monitor cellulose synthesis during cell plate formation it is essential to precisely determine the stage of cell plate formation . the tvn corresponds to the zone of the developing cell plate at the equator of the phragmoplast . as soon as the phragmoplast moves away centrifugally the central phragmoplast free zone turns into the tn which upon fusion of the cell plate with the mother cell _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ turns into a fs before turning into the mature cell plate . in figure we labelled microtubules with anti tubulin antibodies the dna with dapi and the _LOCATION_ networks that support cell plate formation with anti syntaxin _PROTEIN_ antibodies . during the prophase and metaphase _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were present in intracellular compartments surrounding the _LOCATION_ and there was no labelling at the equatorial plane . at the transition anaphase/telophase when the chromosomes were separated and still condensed _PROTEIN_ labelled the cell equator corresponding to the phragmoplast surrounded tvn . at this stage _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was already present in the developing cell plate . as judged from the still condensed chromosomes _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ also colocalised with the labelled tvn . during telophase the _LOCATION_ had evolved into an ovoid shape with partially decondensed dna the phragmoplast microtubules had moved away centrifugally and _PROTEIN_ was still present throughout the cell plate . at this stage both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were present in the phragmoplast depleted tn but the label was stronger at the peripheral phragmoplast surrounded tvn zone of the cell plate . at the _PROTEIN_ telophase large nucleoli were visible in the _LOCATION_ and phragmoplast microtubules disappeared where the cell plate reached the parental _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . at this stage _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ remained more abundant at the cell plate periphery . in conclusion both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were present in the cell plate at as early as at the tvn phase . the presence of cscs at the tvn stage precedes the previously reported observation of cellulose from the tn stage on . we therefore investigated whether these cscs also synthesize cellulose . to this end we used the cellulose specific _METHOD_ dye pontamine fast _PROTEIN_ and the crystalline cellulose binding module to label whole mount preparations of roots . showed a strong transverse fibrillar staining pattern corresponding to cellulose microfibrils in all root cell walls . as expected this staining was significantly reduced in roots treated with the cellulose synthesis inhibitor isoxaben or in roots of the cellulose deficient mutant _PROTEIN_ both of which displayed radially expanded cells . interestingly in dividing cells also stained the developing cell plate even at stages as early as at the tvn stage as shown by the flattened _LOCATION_ with still condensed chromosomes . this staining was not due to _METHOD_ as shown by the unlabelled control . at the same stage the staining was weaker in the isoxaben treated plants and at background levels in _PROTEIN_ roots confirming the specificity of the stain for cellulose . the presence of cellulose in developing cell plates was confirmed by whole mount immunolabelling with . again cellulose was detected at the transition anaphase/telophase and mature cell plates with no labelling at the metaphase . the labelling was weaker in the isoxaben treated plants compared with untreated seedlings . our data show that cellulose is present from the tvn stage on which is consistent with the early appearance of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the developing cell plate . cell plate formation is initiated by the formation of dense phragmoplast microtubule arrays . along these arrays _LOCATION_ derived _LOCATION_ vesicles migrate to the equatorial plane where they form membranous compartments through homotypic fusion inside the cell plate assembly _PROTEIN_ . these compartments form tubular structures which grow and coalesce thus forming the tvn . here we observed that at the anaphase/telophase transition _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ containing compartments moved throughout the cell but were excluded from the growing cell plate by the dense phragmoplast microtubule arrays . the exclusion from the cell plate of _LOCATION_ stacks and other organelles by phragmoplast microtubules has been observed previously . we investigated whether cscs were associated with the phragmoplast using transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and mcherry mbd . using spinning disk microscopy and image processing we detected a faint but reproducible _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signal overlapping with the microtubule signal at early and _PROTEIN_ telophase . treatment with the microtubule stabilising drug taxol further enhanced the phragmoplast associated _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signal . together these results suggest that cscs are present in phragmoplast associated vesicles which presumably are on their way to the cell plate . during telophase the phragmoplast depleted central zone becomes accessible to organelles . a reconstruction of a _PROTEIN_ telophase phragmoplast clearly shows the close proximity of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ containing compartments to the central microtubule free zone . time lapse movies showed that in this zone doughnut shaped compartments _LOCATION_ frequently paused and made contact with the cell plate . in some cases we also observed the delivery of _METHOD_ material from the compartment to the cell plate . finally after fusion of the cell plate with the mother cell _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ punctae were shown to migrate directly from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to the cell plate via the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ cell plate junction . in conclusion _METHOD_ labelled cscs appeared to reach the cell plate at least through three distinct pathways via phragmoplast associated compartments direct or indirect delivery from mobile compartments _LOCATION_ to microtubule free zones of the growing cell plate or through _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ cell plate junctions . time lapse imaging of maturing cell plates showed that the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signal which initially had a more or less uniform distribution throughout the cell plate rapidly diminished in the central zone and increased in the peripheral phragmoplast covered zone . we next investigated whether the depletion of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ from the central zone was the result of active vesicle retrieval which is a process topologically equivalent to endocytosis from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to this end we studied the effect of the arf gef inhibitor brefeldin a on cells coexpressing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and the early endosome marker mcherry g . bfa triggers in arabidopsis the aggregation of endosomal compartments and inhibits recycling from endosome to _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in untreated seedlings mcherry g labelled intracellular punctae as well as the cell plate as described before . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ partially overlapped with mcherry g in the cell plate and endosomes . upon bfa treatment for min _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was found in mcherry g containing endosomal aggregates and in the doughnut shaped compartments that surrounded these aggregates . these aggregates were present at both ends of the early stage cell plate presumably excluded from the central zone by the phragmoplast microtubules . at _PROTEIN_ stages however they were located primarily around the microtubule free central zone . this finding suggests that the retrieval of cscs occured primarily in zones of the cell plate not covered by the phragmoplast . to investigate whether csc retrieval was clathrin mediated we used a line that co _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and the clathrin large subunit fused to morange . both markers were present at the cell plate from _PROTEIN_ anaphase to telophase . clc morange was present in the central zone and less abundant in the peripheral zone in line with a previous study which showed increased numbers of clathrin coated vesicles in the microtubule free area . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in contrast showed a stronger signal at the periphery of the cell plate . next we used time lapse imaging to track the retrieval of clathrin coated _METHOD_ csc containing punctae . we indeed observed the retrieval of clc _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ punctae from the cell plate with a corresponding _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ at the cell plate . we also observed retrieval of doubly labelled punctae from the parental _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . at _PROTEIN_ telophase many of the phragmoplast arrays were surrounded by multiple doubly labelled punctae the presence of clc morange suggested that these _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ containing compartments were generated by clathrin mediated retrieval from the cell plate center or the parental _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . it is possible but not proven that these phragmoplast associated compartments mediate the recycling of cscs to the peripheral growth zone of the cell plate . dynamins form springs around _LOCATION_ compartments causing them to constrict . they play a role in clathrin mediated endocytosis but also in the formation of tubular structures of the tvn . one family member _PROTEIN_ is essential for cell plate formation as shown by the randomly oriented incomplete cell plates in a loss of function mutant . to investigate the role of _PROTEIN_ in cell plate formation we generated an arabidopsis line _PROTEIN_ both _PROTEIN_ morange and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . both proteins accumulated in the cell plate and were relocalised from the center to the peripheral zone during cell plate maturation . as tubule formation takes place in this peripheral zone and clathrin mediated endocytosis preferentially in the central zone the _PROTEIN_ accumulation pattern suggests a role primarily in tvn formation . similarly the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ accumulation pattern also suggests a role for cellulose synthesis during tvn formation and/or its transition into the tn rather than in the subsequent maturation into the fs .
