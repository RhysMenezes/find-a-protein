leaf venation develops complex patterns in _METHOD_ but the mechanism underlying this process is largely unknown . to elucidate the molecular _METHOD_ governing vein pattern formation we previously isolated vascular network defective mutants that displayed venation discontinuities . here we report the phenotypic analysis of mutants and we identify and characterize the _PROTEIN_ gene . detailed phenotypic analysis shows that mutants are defective in procambium cell differentiation and subsequent vascular cell differentiation . reduced shoot and root cell growth is observed in mutants suggesting that _PROTEIN_ function is important for cell growth and the establishment of venation continuity . consistent with these phenotypes the _PROTEIN_ gene is strongly _PROTEIN_ in vascular and meristematic cells . _PROTEIN_ encodes a putative _PROTEIN_ which is a known guanine nucleotide exchange _PROTEIN_ for rab _PROTEIN_ involved in regulating vesicle transport and a known tethering _PROTEIN_ that determines the specificity of _LOCATION_ fusion . _PROTEIN_ protein localizes at the trans _LOCATION_ network/early endosome . aberrant recycling of the auxin efflux carrier _PROTEIN_ proteins is observed in mutants . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ mediated exocytosis at the tgn plays important roles in plant vascular development and cell growth in shoot and root . our identification of _PROTEIN_ as a putative _PROTEIN_ shows that rab _PROTEIN_ are crucial _PROTEIN_ for continuous vascular development and provides further evidence for the importance of vesicle transport in leaf vascular formation .
leaves of mutants have defects in vascular differentiation but how _PROTEIN_ regulates vascular development was not clear . vascular cells differentiate from procambium cells which arise in leaves from the ground meristem . to examine the steps of vascular tissue differentiation that are affected by the _PROTEIN_ mutation we introduced gus to the mutant as a marker of procambium cells . in wild type cotyledons gus was continuously _PROTEIN_ along the mid vein and the proximal and distal loops of _PROTEIN_ veins which resulted in the contiguous procambium cell files developing venation . in mutant cotyledons gus _PROTEIN_ cells occasionally formed discontinuous _PROTEIN_ loops . continuous loops of gus _PROTEIN_ cell files that did not develop vascular tracheary elements were also observed in mutants and showed defects in _PROTEIN_ steps of vascular cell development . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is involved in early vascular patterning of the procambium network and _PROTEIN_ vascular cell differentiation such as the development of tracheary elements from procambial cells . to examine the relationship between _PROTEIN_ and auxin transport mediated vascular pattern formation we crossed the mutant with the _PROTEIN_ mutant which is defective in _PROTEIN_ auxin transport and analyzed the resulting venation patterns . the mutant had a discontinuous vascular network in cotyledons but no significant effects on the overall vascular pattern architecture . the _PROTEIN_ seedlings had fused cotyledons in which the mid vein was occasionally furcated . seedlings of the _PROTEIN_ double mutant exhibited fused cotyledons in which discontinuous veins were formed like those in implying an additive effect of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations . we also analyzed the effect of n naphthylphthalamic acid an auxin transport inhibitor on the vascular patterning in first node leaves . npa progressively enhanced the vascular differentiation especially along the leaf margin as the concentration of npa was increased and the marginal vascular tissues were connected to central vascular tissues in the wild type . in mutant grown with npa vascularization was enhanced which mimicked wild type plants treated with npa but the vasculature often became disconnected at leaf margins like those in . finally we observed the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization during cotyledon vascular development . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ within the cells in the secondary vein was known to localize towards the primary veins in wild type cells and these features were also observed in mutant cells . dissection of cotyledons from embryos damaged the tissues whose impact seemed to cause variations of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal intensity . therefore we can not determine the amount of _PROTEIN_ protein at the pm in cotyledon veins however we could identify that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ domain at the cotyledon margin in mutant is more fragile than in the wild type which presumably leads to discontinuity of venation . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ regulates venation patterning through primarily _PROTEIN_ or establishing the peds rather than establishing the _PROTEIN_ localization of _PROTEIN_ proteins . to address further the role of _PROTEIN_ in plant development we performed phenotypic analysis of the mutant at the whole plant level . we analyzed the phenotypes of day old mutant seedlings . the mutant displayed smaller leaves and shorter primary roots than wild type seedlings and these defects were lethal when the seedlings were approximately weeks old . serial observations revealed that the primary root length of was essentially the same as that of the wild type until days after germination whereas the slower growth of roots became obvious by dag . at dag primary roots were five times shorter than those of the wild type and developed more adventitious roots than the wild type . next we performed tissue culture experiments . we first induced adventitious root development from hypocotyls obtained from seedlings at dag . ler hypocotyls actively produced adventitious roots whereas the mutant hypocotyls produced fewer and shorter adventitious roots . we also induced adventitious shoots from hypocotyls and compared their growth . the induction of adventitious shoots was successful in wild type hypocotyls whereas the mutants did not develop any shoot like structures although they did develop greenish spots . finally we tested the induction of callus formation from hypocotyls . the calli grew more slowly than those of the wild type which suggests that _PROTEIN_ function is necessary to _PROTEIN_ cell division . together these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ also functions in other developmental _METHOD_ in addition to vascular development . _PROTEIN_ was previously mapped to the top of chromosome . to clone _PROTEIN_ we generated a large mapping population from a cross between and wild type columbia . the population was scored for the mutant phenotype and mutant plants were selected and screened with polymorphic markers which were designed based on the limited sequence data in the region mapped as the _PROTEIN_ locus . finally _PROTEIN_ was localized to the bac clone as illustrated in fig . . there were genes in this region based on gene annotation . all genes were completely sequenced in the background and a c to t nucleotide transition mutation was found in the predicted coding sequence of _GENE_ . to confirm that this gene is the causal gene of the mutant the wild type sequence that contains kb upstream of the putative transcription start site and approximately kb downstream of the putative transcription termination site was introduced into the mutant by agrobacterium mediated transformation . this region rescued the phenotype of the mutant confirming that _PROTEIN_ encodes _GENE_ . we isolated the full length _PROTEIN_ cdna by combination of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and defined the structure of the _PROTEIN_ gene . the _PROTEIN_ gene encoded a protein composed of amino acids and glutamine at codon was changed to a stop codon in the mutant . _GENE_ was recently reported as a putative _PROTEIN_ a member of the trappii complex that functions as a gef for and/or a tethering _PROTEIN_ . _GENE_ was shown to regulate exocytosis the cell plate and cell _PROTEIN_ formation in arabidopsis . we identified defects in cell division and venation in mutants . these similarities provided further evidence that _PROTEIN_ encodes _GENE_ . we investigated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ patterns by performing rna gel blot analysis using digoxigenin labeled antisense rna probes for the cdnas . rna was isolated from roots leaves _METHOD_ and flowers . _PROTEIN_ mrna accumulated in all organs tested which is consistent with previous data obtained by reverse transcription pcr analyses . we identified differential accumulation of _PROTEIN_ mrna among different organs . _PROTEIN_ mrna accumulated to high levels in roots and flowers which include meristematic cells . these results suggest strong _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in meristematic cells . to examine further the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ we produced transgenic plants harboring the _PROTEIN_ reporter gene fused to a kbp upstream promoter region of _PROTEIN_ . gus _PROTEIN_ was detected in flowers and roots . strong _PROTEIN_ was detected at root _METHOD_ and vascular cells in _PROTEIN_ stamens and roots . in pistils gus _PROTEIN_ was detected particularly at vascular cells in the funiculus and ovules . notably stronger _PROTEIN_ was detected in immature vascular cells close to ovules which implies a role for _PROTEIN_ in vascular development . the mutant has a characteristic phenotype with respect to leaf vascular development . therefore we performed detailed analysis of gus _PROTEIN_ during venation development . we initially analyzed gus _PROTEIN_ in torpedo stage embryos when the differentiation of procambium cells in cotyledons starts . gus _PROTEIN_ was ubiquitous throughout the torpedo embryo and the _PROTEIN_ level was largely uniform among the tissues . next we analyzed gus _PROTEIN_ in cotyledons of seedlings at dag when procambium cells differentiate into vascular cells including xylem cells and found that gus _PROTEIN_ was confined to the veins with strong _PROTEIN_ in procambium cells . these _PROTEIN_ patterns are in good agreement with the venation defects of mutants . subcellular localization analysis of _PROTEIN_ has not been reported . to examine the intracellular localization of _PROTEIN_ we analyzed the association of _PROTEIN_ with plant _LOCATION_ . for this experiment we produced a plasmid in which the _PROTEIN_ cds containing the kb promoter and the kb untranslated region was fused with the c terminal myc tag . this plasmid complemented the mutants when introduced into by agrobacterium mediated transformation indicating that the _PROTEIN_ fusion protein is fully functional . we prepared microsomal _LOCATION_ and soluble protein fractions from the _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants and examined the presence of _PROTEIN_ with an anti myc antibody . the _PROTEIN_ protein was detected in both the _LOCATION_ and the soluble fraction but it was more enriched in the _LOCATION_ fraction . the _LOCATION_ association was sensitive to urea triton x and chaps whereas it was resistant to nacl . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is not an integral _LOCATION_ protein but a peripheral _LOCATION_ protein that associates with plant _LOCATION_ via non electrostatic interactions . to gain insights into the intracellular site of _PROTEIN_ activity we examined localization of _PROTEIN_ proteins using anti myc antibody in the roots of transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter . we failed to detect reliable signals under normal conditions . however some signals were detected in the presence of bfa an arf gef inhibitor . in arabidopsis bfa treatment induces the aggregation of endosomes into so called bfa bodies surrounded by _LOCATION_ bodies . _PROTEIN_ localized at the core of bfa bodies and the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ distinctly surrounded the bfa bodies . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ proteins are localized in endosomes . the failure of immunostaining of _PROTEIN_ under normal untreated conditions may result from instability of _PROTEIN_ during fixation . to overcome this problem we established transgenic mutants complemented by the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . functional _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines were crossed with monomeric red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged organelle marker lines and we observed the root cells . dot like signals of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were not significantly localized with the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or the pre _LOCATION_ compartment/multivesicular body marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . in contrast significant co localization between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the tgn/ee marker _LOCATION_ h _PROTEIN_ subunit _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was observed . we also analyzed the effects of bfa on the localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . similar to the case with _PROTEIN_ bfa caused aggregation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ surrounded by the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labeled organelles . no significant co localization was observed between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ co localized with _METHOD_ and with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ at the core of bfa bodies . furthermore _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ almost completely co localized with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at the bfa body implying their close relationships . these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ acts at tgn/ee compartments . based on the subcellular localization it is conceivable that _PROTEIN_ may regulate _LOCATION_ trafficking in the translocation of cargo to the pm or other cellular compartments . _PROTEIN_ proteins undergo constitutive clathrin mediated endocytosis and subsequent recycling to _METHOD_ thus they are good markers to visualize protein internalization and recycling . since analyzing the intracellular function of _PROTEIN_ by using leaf vascular cells was technically difficult we used root cells to analyze endocytic recycling of _PROTEIN_ proteins . first we performed immunolocalization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ under normal conditions . in wild type cells _PROTEIN_ localized to the basal sides of _METHOD_ in vascular cells whereas _PROTEIN_ localized apically and basally at the _METHOD_ in epidermal and cortical cells respectively . in roots the _PROTEIN_ localization of _PROTEIN_ proteins is largely normal which fits with our phenotypic analysis of _PROTEIN_ double mutants . however increased internalization of _PROTEIN_ proteins was observed in roots . we also applied bfa to root cells to examine whether _PROTEIN_ was required for the cycling of _PROTEIN_ proteins . bfa predominantly inhibits the exocytic pathway rather than the endocytic pathway so that the ratio between exocytosis and endocytosis is perturbed and endocytic materials accumulate in the cell . consistent with previous studies treatment of wild type roots with bfa led to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ accumulation in typically two or three large endosomal aggregations . in contrast bfa treatment of mutants resulted in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ localization in more numerous and larger endosomal aggregates in each cell . we also analyzed the protein levels of _PROTEIN_ at _METHOD_ in mutants . we used _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines instead of _PROTEIN_ antibody because immune detection often causes the variation of signal intensity . signal intensity of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at _METHOD_ in mutants was significantly lower than that of the wild type . altogether these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is required for normal cycling of _PROTEIN_ proteins possibly in the delivery of exocytic vesicles to the pm .
