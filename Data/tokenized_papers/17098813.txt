s adenosylmethionine is formed exclusively in the _LOCATION_ but plays a major role in _LOCATION_ sam can either act as a methyl donor for the biogenesis of small molecules such as prenyllipids and macromolecules or as a regulator of the synthesis of aspartate derived amino acids . because the biosynthesis of sam is restricted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ require a sam importer . however this transporter has not yet been identified . here we report the molecular and functional characterization of an arabidopsis thaliana gene designated sam _PROTEIN_ which encodes a _LOCATION_ metabolite transporter required for the import of sam from the _LOCATION_ . recombinant _PROTEIN_ produced in yeast cells when reconstituted into liposomes mediated the counter exchange of sam with sam and with s adenosylhomocysteine the by product and inhibitor of transmethylation reactions using sam . insertional mutation in _PROTEIN_ and virus induced gene silencing of _PROTEIN_ in nicotiana benthamiana caused severe growth retardation in mutant plants . impaired function of _PROTEIN_ led to _PROTEIN_ accumulation of prenyllipids and _PROTEIN_ affected the chlorophyll pathway . biochemical analysis suggests that the latter effect represents one prominent example of the multiple events triggered by undermethylation when there is _PROTEIN_ sam flux into _LOCATION_ .
a blastp search revealed that the closest arabidopsis homolog of the yeast mitochondrial samt is encoded by _GENE_ . the corresponding protein provisionally named _PROTEIN_ showed amino acid identity with . based on this evidence we amplified and cloned _PROTEIN_ and its homologs from capsicum annuum _PROTEIN_ and nicotiana benthamiana _PROTEIN_ using single stranded cdnas transcribed from total rna . the gene products of _PROTEIN_ ca _PROTEIN_ and nb _PROTEIN_ have approximate molecular _METHOD_ of kd . the peptide sequence of _PROTEIN_ exhibits identity to the sequences of the putative ca _PROTEIN_ and nb _PROTEIN_ homologs which in turn have identity with the yeast sequence . _PROTEIN_ has identity to the predicted amino acid sequence of _GENE_ when compared pairwise . a blast search revealed no significant similarity between _PROTEIN_ and r. prowazekii samt . the n terminal regions of _PROTEIN_ ca _PROTEIN_ and nb _PROTEIN_ displayed sequence motifs that could be identified as putative _LOCATION_ transit peptides using chlorop and targetp . analysis of _PROTEIN_ using the transmembrane prediction program tmpred revealed that _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ bound protein with five _LOCATION_ spanning domains located at residues to to to to and to . these domains were also predicted in yeast . the _PROTEIN_ profile of _PROTEIN_ was analyzed using the digital northern tool of genevestigator . _PROTEIN_ is ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis but is most highly _PROTEIN_ in the pedicel the shoot apex and juvenile leaves . to identify genes that show similar _PROTEIN_ patterns as _PROTEIN_ we performed cluster analysis of the atgenexpress developmental series microarray data . _PROTEIN_ belongs to a highly correlated cluster of genes all of which are _PROTEIN_ predominantly in photosynthetic tissues such as rosette leaves and in the vegetative shoot apex but are strongly repressed in roots and _PROTEIN_ stages of seed development . in accordance with the proposed function of _PROTEIN_ the cluster contains genes involved in heme and chlorophyll biosynthesis and methyltransferases _PROTEIN_ . the pac mutant which is defective in the _PROTEIN_ was previously shown to have altered chloroplast and leaf development and it was suggested that _PROTEIN_ is involved in chloroplast mrna maturation . because the organellar targeting of proteins predicted by _METHOD_ can not be considered completely reliable the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ was experimentally tested using green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion proteins and antibodies raised against recombinant _PROTEIN_ . the similarity between _PROTEIN_ and yeast mitochondrial samt starts at residue . the computer based _METHOD_ chlorop and targetp predicted a cleavage of _PROTEIN_ between residues and . to validate this prediction a construct was made in which the first n terminal amino acids of _PROTEIN_ were fused to _METHOD_ . the resulting dna construct was subcloned downstream of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter to give _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . a construct without translational fusion between the first n terminal residues and the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was used as a control . both constructs were introduced into n. benthamiana protoplasts using the methods of citation . after incubation at for h the protoplast preparations were examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy . the _METHOD_ images revealed that the transiently _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized exclusively in tobacco chloroplasts characterized by their red _METHOD_ whereas the control _METHOD_ was detected in the _LOCATION_ . to further analyze the compartmentation of _PROTEIN_ intact purified arabidopsis chloroplasts chloroplast subfractions _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and mitochondria were isolated and subjected to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and immunoblot analysis using specific polyclonal antibodies raised against recombinant _PROTEIN_ . on immunoblots of chloroplast proteins the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody detected a major band with a molecular _METHOD_ of kd corresponding to the mature form of _PROTEIN_ in total chloroplast and in chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ proteins . neither _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ nor stroma proteins contained immunoreactive _PROTEIN_ . the purity of the isolated mitochondria and _LOCATION_ and of their subcompartments was tested using antibodies directed against proteins known to be localized in specific chloroplast or mitochondrial compartments . these included anti lhciib for the light harvesting chlorophyll a/b complex for the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ anti _PROTEIN_ for the chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ triose phosphate translocator anti _PROTEIN_ for the stromal deoxy d xylulose phosphate synthase and anti _PROTEIN_ for the respiratory chain nadh dehydrogenase of mitochondria . immunoblot analysis of mitochondrial proteins with anti _PROTEIN_ showed a faint signal corresponding approximately to the same molecular _METHOD_ protein as that detected previously in chloroplast protein samples . this unidentified protein has a localization pattern that coincides with that of the mitochondrial nadh dehydrogenase _PROTEIN_ . this immunoreactivity could be attributable to the _PROTEIN_ that _PROTEIN_ and _GENE_ share amino acid sequence . in addition several bioinformatic analyses suggest that _GENE_ may be located in the mitochondria . after treatment of chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ with m sodium _PROTEIN_ ph and ultracentrifugation _PROTEIN_ remained in the alkali insoluble _LOCATION_ pellet . this treatment releases peripheral proteins while not significantly solubilizing integral proteins . under similar conditions _PROTEIN_ was not extracted from the chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ using m nacl . as would be predicted for an integral protein _PROTEIN_ was completely solubilized by treatment with triton x . the localization of _PROTEIN_ in the chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ has been suggested previously by bioinformatic analysis and demonstrated by proteomics supporting the localization data presented in this study . collectively these data demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is an integral _LOCATION_ protein that is localized in the chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ . sequence similarity to known proteins allows for the development of testable hypotheses about the possible function of a novel protein . to test our hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ encodes a samt we _PROTEIN_ the corresponding cdna in yeast cells under the control of a galactose inducible promoter . the nucleotides encoding the first n terminal amino acids of the _LOCATION_ targeting sequence were omitted from the _PROTEIN_ construct because the presence of the _LOCATION_ targeting sequence frequently leads to reduced _PROTEIN_ levels in yeast cells instead codons encoding an n terminal hexa his tag were inserted at the n terminus allowing the detection of the recombinant protein with antibodies directed against the his tag . total _LOCATION_ fractions were prepared from transgenic yeast harboring the _PROTEIN_ construct or an empty vector and analyzed by _PROTEIN_ gel staining and protein gel blot for the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . visual inspection of the _METHOD_ blue stained _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gel revealed the presence of an additional protein band with an apparent molecular _METHOD_ of kd in the _LOCATION_ fractions of yeast cells harboring the _PROTEIN_ construct that was not detectable in yeast cells containing the control construct . proteins from an identical gel were electrotransferred onto a _LOCATION_ and subsequently immunodecorated using an anti penta his monoclonal antibody . a specific signal with an apparent molecular _METHOD_ of kd was detected in cells harboring the _PROTEIN_ construct but not in control cells indicating that the additional protein band observed in the _METHOD_ blue stained gel represents recombinant his tagged _PROTEIN_ . _LOCATION_ fractions from both yeast lines were reconstituted into liposomes that had been preloaded with sam and assayed for sam transport activity . background sam transport activity of reconstituted _LOCATION_ proteins from control cells was negligible whereas liposomes reconstituted with _LOCATION_ from yeast cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed high saturable sam sam counter exchange activity . to investigate the putative function of a transporter protein in vivo knowledge of its substrate specificity as well as its apparent km values is required . using proteoliposomes preloaded with saturating concentrations of sam we observed an apparent km value of for the uptake of radiolabeled sam into liposomes . the apparent vmax values for sam sam counter exchange were determined in the five independent experiments conducted to determine the apparent km for sam uptake and ranged between and indicating that the levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the efficiency of reconstitution were comparable between the independent replicates . the substrate specificity of _PROTEIN_ was analyzed by measuring the uptake of radiolabeled sam into proteoliposomes that had been preloaded with saturating concentrations of sam sahc s methylmethionine met adenosine or control substrates respectively . the sam sam counter exchange rates were set to and exchange rates for other substrates were calculated relative to the rates observed for cis/trans sam transport . liposomes reconstituted with _PROTEIN_ showed high rates of sam uptake when preloaded with either sam or sahc whereas the uptake of sam into liposomes preloaded with smm met adenosine or no counter exchange substrate was negligible . together these results clearly demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ represents a high affinity sam sahc antiporter that has negligible sam uniporter activity and that does not accept nonspecific counter exchange substrates such as smm met or adenosine . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ has the function of a _LOCATION_ samt in vivo and whether a mutation in the _PROTEIN_ gene would affect _LOCATION_ functions we identified a t dna insertion for _PROTEIN_ from the salk institute genomic analysis laboratory collection . to this end the line _PROTEIN_ was selected . the progeny of self fertilized heterozygous kanamycin resistant plants grown under nonselective conditions revealed a segregation of pale green leaf phenotype during the first weeks and a severely growth retarded phenotype . _PROTEIN_ mutants have very low germination efficiency with < viable seedlings produced . furthermore _PROTEIN_ has a long generation time at least three times that of wild type plants . the segregation ratio of the encoded kanamycin marker corresponded to as expected for a single mendelian transmission . when heterozygous kanamycin resistant plants were grown under selective conditions the kanamycin resistance or sensitivity and the mutant phenotype segregated in the following ratio mutant kanr wild type kanr wild type kans . this finding indicated that the phenotype was genetically linked to the homozygous state of the mutation . we confirmed by sequencing the t dna flanking genomic dna regions in the _PROTEIN_ mutant line that the t dna insertion is located at position of _PROTEIN_ in the third intron downstream of the start codon . this insertion leads to the truncation of _PROTEIN_ after amino acids . one band was observed in the homozygous line and its size is consistent with the insertion of a single t dna . the absence of _PROTEIN_ mrna from the _PROTEIN_ mutant line was verified by rt pcr rna gel blot analysis and protein gel blot analysis using anti _PROTEIN_ antibody and purified chloroplasts prepared from leaf protoplasts . rt pcr using primers surrounding the targeted insertion region demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ mrna was absent from the homozygous insertion line but was clearly detectable in the heterozygous line and the wild type columbia ecotype . arabidopsis tubulin was used as a control to assess the quality of the mrna and the efficiency of the rt pcr . the absence of _PROTEIN_ mrna in the homozygous line was also confirmed by rna gel blot analysis . in addition purified _LOCATION_ were prepared from the wild type and heterozygous and homozygous _PROTEIN_ lines and subjected to protein immunoblot analysis . _PROTEIN_ was not detectable in _LOCATION_ preparations obtained from the homozygous _PROTEIN_ line but it was clearly detectable as a protein with an apparent molecular _METHOD_ of kd in the heterozygous and wild type lines . these data demonstrate that a t dna insertion in _PROTEIN_ leads to a null allele of _PROTEIN_ . to further show that the phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutant was caused by the t dna insertion in _PROTEIN_ we attempted genetic complementation of the mutant phenotype by _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the mutant background . to this end a kb genomic fragment encoding the amino acid sequence of _PROTEIN_ was placed under transcriptional control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter and the resulting construct _PROTEIN_ was introduced into the heterozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant . from the progeny we selected complemented lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ that contained both the _PROTEIN_ transgene and the t dna insertion using pcr and rt pcr based genotyping as described in methods . five lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ containing a homozygous _PROTEIN_ allele and the _PROTEIN_ transgene were obtained . figure shows that the phenotype of a representative transgenic line containing _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ transgene _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is similar to that of the wild type . in addition rt pcr rna gel blot and protein immunoblot analyses revealed the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ mrna and protein in these homozygous complemented lines . collectively these data demonstrate that the phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutant is caused by t dna insertional inactivation of _PROTEIN_ and that the phenotype conferred by _PROTEIN_ can be rescued by _PROTEIN_ of the wild type _PROTEIN_ in the mutant background . to confirm that the observed phenotype is linked to a sam transport defect we evaluated the uptake of labeled sam into chloroplasts isolated from the homozygous mutant line and determined the endogenous chloroplast sam concentration . as shown in figure the capacity of chloroplasts isolated from the _PROTEIN_ lines to import sam is significantly lower than that of the complemented lines or the wild type plants . a similar trend was observed concerning the endogenous concentration of chloroplast sam . based on the stromal volume per unit of chlorophyll reported by citation the estimated concentrations of sam in the stroma were equivalent to in _PROTEIN_ plants and in wild type plants . because sam is required and channeled toward different subplastial pathways of prenyllipid biosynthesis we evaluated whether _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ could regulate the supply of sam engaged in chlorophyll tocopherol _PROTEIN_ and plastoquinone biosynthesis in vivo . the results shown in figures and indicate that total chlorophyll content and plastoquinone contents were reduced in _PROTEIN_ compared with wild type col . the overall level of tocopherol and _PROTEIN_ was slightly lower in _PROTEIN_ plants however the carotenoid content was not significantly modified . a key metabolic step in which _LOCATION_ sam is engaged is the conversion of mgproto ix to mgproto ix me . hypothesizing that this step might be affected we incubated detached rosette leaves with aminolevulinate the chlorophyll precursor . as shown in figure the total amount of mgproto ix and the ratio of mgproto ix to mgproto ix me were higher in _PROTEIN_ than in wild type col . these data are consistent with a lower capacity of _PROTEIN_ to import _LOCATION_ sam channeled to the chlorophyll pathway . to verify the results obtained with the arabidopsis insertion mutant using an independent experimental approach we examined whether identical metabolic changes could be observed in n. benthamiana plants in which the _PROTEIN_ of n. benthamiana _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ had been deliberately silenced using a virus induced gene silencing strategy . to this end we cloned a fragment of nb _PROTEIN_ into the viral vector tto and inoculated n. benthamiana plants with infectious tto nb _PROTEIN_ mrnas . a construct consisting of tto harboring a fragment of the bacterial phytoene synthase sequence was used as a control rather than the empty vector because _PROTEIN_ of the latter sometimes causes adverse effects on plant growth . three weeks after infiltration the silencing effect was analyzed . nb _PROTEIN_ silenced plants were strongly stunted and became pale green whereas control plants infected with tto crtb resembled wild type plants . rt pcr was performed to evaluate the silencing efficiency of nb _PROTEIN_ using primers annealing outside of the and ends of the fragment used for the tto nb _PROTEIN_ construct . nb _PROTEIN_ mrnas were strongly reduced in silenced tissues compared with control tissues infected with tto crtb and wild type tissues . a similar trend was observed using mrna gel blot analysis . to examine the metabolic changes in _LOCATION_ from nb _PROTEIN_ silenced plants we analyzed the level of _LOCATION_ pigments and prenyllipids of upper uninoculated leaves weeks after inoculation . the total content of chlorophyll and plastoquinone was reduced significantly in nb _PROTEIN_ silenced plants . this phenomenon was accompanied by an increased accumulation of tocopherol in tissues _PROTEIN_ tto nb _PROTEIN_ . no such changes were observed in upper uninoculated leaf tissues from control plants infected with tto crtb and in wild type plants . by contrast the carotenoid content remained essentially unchanged . to evaluate the effect of nb _PROTEIN_ silencing on the chlorophyll pathway upper uninoculated leaves were detached from nb _PROTEIN_ silenced plants tto crtb infected plants and wild type plants and fed with aminolevulinate as shown above . similar to what was observed in the arabidopsis t dna insertion mutant leaf tissues of nb _PROTEIN_ silenced plants exhibited a higher content of mgproto ix and higher mgproto ix to mgproto ix me ratio compared with control tissues of tto crtb and wild type tissues . this observation strongly suggests that nb _PROTEIN_ is required for the import of sam from the _LOCATION_ as shown above for _PROTEIN_ and further supports the notion that nb _PROTEIN_ functions as a transporter in the _LOCATION_ envelope .

displaying both and kb amplicons attributable to trbcs and _PROTEIN_ primer combinations respectively were used for a second pcr to select from the pools individual _PROTEIN_ lines harboring the _PROTEIN_ transgene . during this second pcr step purified dna from each plant of the relevant pool was separately used as a template in combination with trbcs and _PROTEIN_ primers . after this step isolated _PROTEIN_ lines harboring the _PROTEIN_ transgene were used to analyze the absence of native _PROTEIN_ in complemented lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by rt pcr using the forward _PROTEIN_ and
