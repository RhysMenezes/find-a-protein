in higher plants nitrate is taken up by root cells where arabidopsis thaliana nitrate _PROTEIN_ chiefly acts as the high affinity nitrate uptake system . nitrate taken up by the roots can then be translocated from the root to the leaves and the seeds . in this work the function of the _PROTEIN_ gene one of the seven members of the _PROTEIN_ family in arabidopsis was investigated . high _PROTEIN_ of the gene was detected in reproductive organs and peaked in dry seeds . _PROTEIN_ or green _METHOD_ protein reporter gene _PROTEIN_ driven by the _PROTEIN_ promoter confirmed this organ specificity . we assessed the capacity of _PROTEIN_ to transport nitrate in xenopus laevis oocytes or when it is _PROTEIN_ ectopically in mutant plants deficient in nitrate transport . we measured the impact of an _PROTEIN_ mutation and found no difference from the wild type during vegetative development . by contrast seed nitrate content was affected by overexpression of _PROTEIN_ or a mutation in the gene . finally we showed that this nitrate transporter protein was localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . our results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ plays a specific role in nitrate accumulation in the seed .
the atgenexpress initiative supported by different countries compiles data from > microarrays and can be used as a tool to follow the _PROTEIN_ of your favorite gene . when we analyzed these in silico data _PROTEIN_ appeared to be highly _PROTEIN_ in seeds . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ increases by a _PROTEIN_ of between the and stages and a _PROTEIN_ of between the and stages of seed development . we thus decided to validate these results by real time pcr analysis alongside all the other members of the _PROTEIN_ family . two different stages of seed development were tested together with root and shoot extracts to compare with our previous results . results of both experiments are summarized in table for the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes . as found previously the _PROTEIN_ gene is predominantly _PROTEIN_ in roots as compared with shoots while the _PROTEIN_ gene is more _PROTEIN_ in shoots . however the most striking point is the huge amount of _PROTEIN_ mrna in seeds especially at the end of seed maturation when the tissue is completely dry . interestingly the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ after h of imbibition . with the exception of _PROTEIN_ which reaches only of the level in dry seeds we could not detect significant _PROTEIN_ of any other _PROTEIN_ family members in this organ in two independent experiments . gene _PROTEIN_ level in different organs to further characterize the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in seeds we have used a fusion between a kb fragment of the _PROTEIN_ promoter and either the _PROTEIN_ or green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ reporter gene . these constructs were stably introduced into the arabidopsis wassilewskija ecotype and figure shows typical results from gus staining of seeds harvested from one of these transformants . after h of imbibition to enable better separation of embryos from seed coats histochemical gus staining was performed . a uniform and strong gus activity was detected in transgenic embryos while wild type embryos remained unstained . the seed coat is characterized by a faint blue staining which reveals a weak _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the surrounding endosperm . homozygous lines were also obtained carrying the _METHOD_ reporter gene under the control of the same kb fragment of the _PROTEIN_ promoter . in these lines embryos were also dissected after h of water imbibition and observed using confocal microscopy . _LOCATION_ were stained with making the embryonic cells clearly visible . strong green _METHOD_ was observed in all tissues including the cotyledons and radicles . altogether these data suggest strongly that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is developmentally regulated and that _PROTEIN_ transcripts accumulate in seeds undergoing dessication . a large number of _PROTEIN_ gene sequences are now available and homologous sequences are found in three clades mosses _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . when the evolutionary relationship between these sequences and those of two _PROTEIN_ genes from algae was investigated using a bayesian method the _PROTEIN_ genes appear to be grouped into well distinct classes for algae mosses and seed plants . in the seed plant clade the _PROTEIN_ genes appeared to be clustered into two monophyletic groups group a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and group b _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . this phylogenetic analysis highlights the _PROTEIN_ that the _PROTEIN_ genes that have been so far characterized as nitrate transporters in arabidopsis nicotiana plumbaginifolia or hordeum vulgare belong to group a . the _PROTEIN_ gene is classified in a distinct monophyletic group within this best characterized family of plant nitrate transporters . thus to evaluate the capacity of the _PROTEIN_ protein to transport nitrate we introduced the _PROTEIN_ cdna driven by the promoter into the _PROTEIN_ mutant background . as a positive control we used transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the np _PROTEIN_ gene under the control of the rold promoter that has been shown to restore nitrate influx in the arabidopsis mutant back to of that shown by the wild type . homozygous transgenic plants were grown for weeks in a hydroponic system on mm a n limiting condition for the _PROTEIN_ mutant . root nitrate influx was measured at an external concentration of mm using . at this concentration the difference in the hats activity between the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ mutant was largest . in two independent experiments the overexpression of the two genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was correlated with an increase in the root influx . this influx in the transgenic plants represents of that measured for the _PROTEIN_ mutant for both genes indicating a similar extent of phenotypic recovery as hats activity was restored in both types of plants . quantitative rt pcr analyses confirmed that this restoration of nitrate influx in the transgenic plants was not due to altered _PROTEIN_ or compensation by other members of the _PROTEIN_ family . relative gene _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ and np _PROTEIN_ genes in roots of the _PROTEIN_ mutant complemented by _PROTEIN_ or prorold np _PROTEIN_ constructs in addition to confirm the hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ is a nitrate transporter we used a heterologous _PROTEIN_ system . in this experiment xenopus laevis oocytes were injected with nuclease free water or _PROTEIN_ mrna . after d oocytes were incubated in a solution enriched with mm and the enrichment of individual oocytes was measured after h. these measurements showed that _PROTEIN_ mrna injected oocytes took up significantly more nitrate than water injected controls . we next investigated the effect of a mutation in the nitrate transporter _PROTEIN_ . t dna mutants were isolated from two independent t dna libraries in the columbia and ws backgrounds and homozygous lines were selected called _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . these mutants are knockouts for the _PROTEIN_ gene but no difference in root nitrate influx mediated by either the hats or the lats was found in both types of plant whether grown with limiting or nonlimiting nitrate supply . nitrate and free amino acid contents in roots and shoots of both mutants were also measured and were found to be identical to the wild type under both levels of nitrate supply . taken together these results suggest that the _PROTEIN_ protein is a functional nitrate transporter but possibly because of its _PROTEIN_ site it is not involved in the direct uptake of nitrate from soil by the root system or in nitrate distribution within the vegetative organs . physiological characterization of the _PROTEIN_ mutants due to its specific _PROTEIN_ pattern we asked if this gene could be involved in nitrate accumulation in seeds . in arabidopsis a recent study showed that n and c metabolites are accumulated in seeds in a specific way during seed formation and maturation but to our knowledge only a few studies have been devoted to nitrate storage in arabidopsis seeds . six independently isolated plant lines per genotype were grown together in the greenhouse under long days on the same soil type and under nonlimiting n conditions . seeds were harvested from individuals after complete maturation and senescence of the plants . the results of seed nitrate content determinations are shown in figure . the _PROTEIN_ seeds had only less nitrate than ws wild type controls . this _PROTEIN_ seed nitrate phenotype was even greater in the col ecotype where a statistically significant reduction of nitrate content in the mutant was observed . as the seed weights are very similar in both the genotypes these differences are observed in nitrate content whether it is _PROTEIN_ on a per seed or on a milligram/dry weight basis . we next compared seed nitrate content in over and underexpressing _PROTEIN_ plants . as the _PROTEIN_ plants were obtained in the ws genotype we increased the amount of nitrate in the nutrient solution up to mm after flowering to enhance the small difference already observed on mm between the mutant and ws wild type . results of a typical experiment are shown in figure . as expected the amount of nitrate in seeds of wild type plants supplied with mm is higher than with mm nitrate . when comparing seed nitrate content after either to mm nitrate supply the amount in the _PROTEIN_ mutant had increased only slightly leading to twofold less nitrate compared with the wild type and this difference was statistically significant . these data support the idea that _PROTEIN_ plays a major role in seed nitrate accumulation and agrees with the result obtained when seed nitrate contents were compared between overexpressor and wild type plants . nitrate contents in _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants reached and of the nitrate in ws and _PROTEIN_ seeds respectively . nitrate was demonstrated to be a signal relieving seed dormancy in arabidopsis . in this study we used the same batch of seeds as those used for nitrate determination to test the impact of endogenous nitrate content on the seed germination of our different genotypes . freshly harvested seeds were sown on agar medium containing only distilled water and the percentage of germination was scored at different times after sowing . in the same experiment the viability of seeds was compared after stratification on media containing mm nitrate and in this case the percentage of germination of all genotypes had increased to . however just d after sowing on water both mutants showed a delay in germination compared with their respective wild type controls . the strongest phenotype was observed for the _PROTEIN_ mutant which displayed significantly fewer germinated seeds throughout the d of measurements compared with its ws control . by contrast the col wild type background showed less dormancy and the germination difference with the corresponding _PROTEIN_ mutant was only significantly different d after sowing . this correlation between nitrate content and seed dormancy was further highlighted by measuring the kinetics of germination of freshly harvested seeds from over and underexpressing plants . the same batches of seeds that had already been tested for their nitrate content were sown on water containing medium and germination was scored as described above . as found when plants are grown on mm nitrate the percentage of germination of seeds of the _PROTEIN_ mutant grown on mm nitrate was always lower when compared with wild type seeds . by contrast seeds from the _PROTEIN_ overexpressors showed a significantly higher percentage of germinated seeds only at d after sowing . to localize _PROTEIN_ at the subcellular level we used a chimeric protein where _METHOD_ was fused to the n terminal part of _PROTEIN_ . the capacity of the _METHOD_ tagged protein to transport nitrate was first tested . we compared the _PROTEIN_ with the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines in the mutant background and found similar effects on the root nitrate influx of and on the seed nitrate contents . in addition the dormancy of the overexpressors was tested and _METHOD_ tagged plants were less dormant than the wild type like the _PROTEIN_ lines . altogether these results demonstrate that the _PROTEIN_ protein was still active when it was fused to _METHOD_ . nitrate transport activity of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion confocal microscopy revealed an _PROTEIN_ dependent green _METHOD_ labeling that coincided with the tonoplast in the mature part of the root . this tonoplast localization was even more evident in the root tip where this subcellular compartment was present as little _LOCATION_ that fused to give the large central _LOCATION_ . this localization was further confirmed by staining lipid _LOCATION_ using the red _METHOD_ probe . by merging the two pictures _METHOD_ and the tonoplast was clearly distinguishable in the root meristem and in the mature part of the root where formation of the _PROTEIN_ central _LOCATION_ occurs . in embryos although _METHOD_ imaging in dry seeds led to a diffuse labeling h of water imbibition allowed us to clearly distinguish two different intracellular patterns a tonoplast localization surrounding the _LOCATION_ that corresponded to seed protein bodies and another more punctuated localization .
