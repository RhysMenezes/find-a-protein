chloroplast division is mediated by the coordinated action of a prokaryote derived division system and a host eukaryote derived _LOCATION_ fission system . the evolutionary conserved prokaryote derived system comprises several _LOCATION_ encoded proteins two of which are thought to control division site placement at the midpoint of the organelle a stromal _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and a topological specificity _PROTEIN_ mine . here we show that _PROTEIN_ one of recessive accumulation and replication of chloroplasts mutants in arabidopsis contains highly elongated and multiple arrayed chloroplasts in developing green tissues . genomic sequence analysis revealed that _PROTEIN_ contains a missense mutation in helix of the chloroplast targeted _PROTEIN_ changing an ala at position to gly . introduction of wild type _PROTEIN_ restores the chloroplast division defects of _PROTEIN_ and quantitative rt pcr analysis showed that the degree of complementation was highly dependent on transgene _PROTEIN_ levels . overexpression of the mutant _PROTEIN_ in transgenic plants results in the inhibition of chloroplast division showing that the mutant protein has retained its division inhibition activity . however in contrast to the defined and punctate intraplastidic localization patterns of an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein the single point mutation in _PROTEIN_ results in aberrant localization patterns inside chloroplasts . we further show that _PROTEIN_ is capable of forming homodimers and that this dimerization capacity is abolished by the mutation in _PROTEIN_ . our data show that _PROTEIN_ is a loss of function mutant of _PROTEIN_ and suggest that the formation of functional _PROTEIN_ homodimers is paramount for appropriate _PROTEIN_ localization ultimately ensuring correct division machinery placement and chloroplast division in plants .
chloroplasts undergo active _LOCATION_ expansion and division during development from undifferentiated proplastids in _METHOD_ . in higher plants chloroplast division is not synchronized which is evident from the variety of chloroplast division states visible in various tissues and cells . to efficiently characterize division states of _PROTEIN_ chloroplasts we made use of hypocotyls and primary leaf petioles at an early stage of seedling development . chlorophyll _METHOD_ imaging by _PROTEIN_ showed that a wide range of green tissues in _PROTEIN_ contain a _PROTEIN_ number of mostly elongated and expanded chloroplasts with irregular shapes as compared with wild type tissues which contain round to ellipsoidal or dumbbell shaped chloroplasts . more detailed single chloroplast imaging using higher magnifications revealed that the morphological abnormalities of _PROTEIN_ chloroplasts are clearly linked to defects in division as revealed by the existence of multiple constrictions . normal chloroplast division follows a coordinated pathway of events slight envelope expansion initial central constriction at a single site further _LOCATION_ constriction and _LOCATION_ fission as the final stage . by contrast _PROTEIN_ chloroplasts did not display a single central constriction but showed a varying number of constrictions from one to several the most severe phenotype showing six constriction sites . moreover these constriction sites were placed randomly but in parallel along the long axis of chloroplasts . the arrayed chloroplast morphology indicates that _LOCATION_ constriction in _PROTEIN_ initiates and proceeds _PROTEIN_ of division initiation at other sites . the asymmetrical placement of constriction sites and the continuing _LOCATION_ expansion results in a heterogeneous population of chloroplasts in _METHOD_ of size and shape including spherical mini chloroplasts less than in diameter . despite this the envelope _LOCATION_ still appears to grow with _PROTEIN_ during the division process . in more mature cells such as mesophyll cells multiple arrayed chloroplasts could not be detected whereas elongated and filamentous chloroplasts could be observed as described previously . it is clear that _PROTEIN_ chloroplasts mislocalize the chloroplast division apparatus during division a phenotype previously not reported . furthermore the observed phenotypes of dividing _PROTEIN_ chloroplasts show significant resemblance to the min mutants in addition to the observed phenotype of _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants . it was previously reported that the asymmetric division of _PROTEIN_ mesophyll chloroplasts showed similarity to the chloroplast morphology observed in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ antisense plants . furthermore the _PROTEIN_ locus was mapped close to the sslp marker _PROTEIN_ on arabidopsis chromosome v which is in close proximity to the _PROTEIN_ locus . to examine our hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ could be allelic to _PROTEIN_ we investigated the _PROTEIN_ profile and the dna sequence of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ . quantification of _PROTEIN_ transcripts using _PROTEIN_ rrna ratio calculations indicated that the transcript abundance in ler and _PROTEIN_ seedlings is almost identical with relative amounts of _LOCATION_ . however _PROTEIN_ sequence analysis in col ler and _PROTEIN_ revealed that a single nucleotide substitution is present in _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ . this cytosine to guanine nucleotide substitution results in a missense mutation within helix at the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ . interestingly alignment analysis of _PROTEIN_ amino acid sequences from bacteria to plants revealed that ala shares limited conservation to green plants . moreover the recent crystal structure and functional analyses of bacterial _PROTEIN_ proteins has revealed that ala is located distantly from crucial motifs and amino acid residues important for direct nucleotide binding and interaction with minc . to date no functional implications have been reported for helix in any species . to test whether the _PROTEIN_ phenotype is indeed due to the mutation in _PROTEIN_ we introduced a wild type _PROTEIN_ transgene into the _LOCATION_ genome of _PROTEIN_ plants . _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ as a fusion with a residue double hemagglutinin epitope tag at its c terminus under the control of the _PROTEIN_ upstream genomic promoter sequence . in all plants were obtained and chloroplast morphology and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels of these plants were examined . in many plants partial or full complementation phenotypes could be observed at the generation which was associated with t dna insertions however several and progenies displayed different chloroplast phenotypes between individuals . by observing hygromycin resistance in segregated plants this observation was most probably due to changes in genomic t dna copy number resulting in disequilibration of the highly sensitive relationship between _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels and chloroplast division . further microscopic characterizations established three independent transgenic lines showing stable complementation phenotypes at and generations whereas more than ten lines showed an apparent division inhibition phenotype . using immunoblot analysis and the anti ha antibody we confirmed that the transgene in these transgenic lines produced the expected sized protein . quantitative rt pcr analyses of total and endogenous _PROTEIN_ transcript levels confirmed that transgenic plants showing successful complementation displayed similar _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transgene _PROTEIN_ levels to wt . by contrast the chloroplast division inhibition phenotype was associated with highly elevated transgene _PROTEIN_ levels consistent with previous observations . together these findings show that _PROTEIN_ is a loss of function mutant of _PROTEIN_ and that the observed phenotype is due to a single mutation . interestingly the observed chloroplast phenotype in partially complemented plants implied that slightly elevated _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ have an effect on chloroplast envelope morphology . several segregating individuals from original plant showed slight division inhibition and normal to larger chloroplasts in diameter within cells . these chloroplasts displayed low heterogeneity in _METHOD_ of size however the chloroplasts showed abnormalities in _METHOD_ of envelope morphology exhibiting distorted or surface rugged outlines . quantitative rt pcr analysis for stable transgenic plants revealed that this phenotype is attributed to moderately enhanced _PROTEIN_ transgene _PROTEIN_ . this indicates that normal _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ may be important not only for appropriate chloroplast division but also for correct envelope morphology . _PROTEIN_ is an inhibitory division protein and its overexpression prevents division in escherichia coli and chloroplasts . if the mutation perturbs _PROTEIN_ function we would expect that _PROTEIN_ overproduction would not affect chloroplast division . to test this we _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of the promoter in wt plant . a total of _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants were obtained and analyzed by microscopy and rt pcr as described previously . from this analysis we found that the transgenic plants displayed division inhibition producing a few but enlarged chloroplasts inside cells . in some cases the large chloroplasts seemed to be vacuolated as observed in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants . quantification of _PROTEIN_ transcript levels showed that endogenous _PROTEIN_ levels were not affected in the _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants proving that the observed division inhibition is associated with _PROTEIN_ transgene _PROTEIN_ . these results show that the _PROTEIN_ mutant protein has retained its division inhibition activity but has lost its ability to control appropriate placement of the division apparatus . we previously reported that an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein localizes to discrete speckle which tend to localize as single spots at _PROTEIN_ regions in ellipsoidal chloroplasts . to investigate the effect of the mutation on intraplastidic behavior of _PROTEIN_ we _PROTEIN_ an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein in live plant cells . as observed previously in transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ of a wt _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein in leaf epidermal cells revealed discrete _METHOD_ signals to single stromal spots/speckles . by contrast _PROTEIN_ of an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein in leaf epidermal cells resulted in chloroplasts showing either large and distorted _METHOD_ aggregates and/or multiple speckles . these data show that the mutation in _PROTEIN_ results in abnormal _PROTEIN_ intraplastidic localization patterns and implies an important role for helix in _METHOD_ of correct _PROTEIN_ localization as part of the chloroplast division pathway . it has been shown that bacterial _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dimers or polymers in the presence of _PROTEIN_ on the _LOCATION_ and it is possible that the intraplastidic mislocalization of _PROTEIN_ inside chloroplasts is either due to loss of direct interaction with the envelope region itself or due to loss of protein protein interaction capabilities . to gain further insights into this we examined protein protein interactions of _PROTEIN_ using the yeast two hybrid system . full length wt _PROTEIN_ proteins were fused to the c terminus of the activation domain _PROTEIN_ and to the dna binding domain _PROTEIN_ respectively and _PROTEIN_ in yeast cells . as a marker for protein protein interactions we made use of the ability of to only grow in the absence of his on positive protein protein interactions . we found that his auxotrophy was only restored in yeast cells cotransformed with both ad _PROTEIN_ and bd _PROTEIN_ showing that _PROTEIN_ can form homodimers . the _PROTEIN_ interaction appears to be relatively weak and/or transient in yeast cells which was further verified by the observation that individual yeast transformants exhibited slightly different growth rates on his selection plates . although the _PROTEIN_ interactions observed are relatively weak repeated experiments have conclusively confirmed that _PROTEIN_ is capable of forming homodimers in vivo . in sharp contrast his auxotrophy was not restored in yeast cells cotransformed with both ad _PROTEIN_ and bd _PROTEIN_ suggesting that the mutation in _PROTEIN_ abolishes its ability to form homodimers . this was further confirmed by the lack of his auxotrophy restoration in yeast cells cotransformed with both ad _PROTEIN_ and bd _PROTEIN_ . taken together our results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is capable of forming homodimers in vivo and that the loss of homodimerization of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ results in intraplastidic mislocalization of _PROTEIN_ ultimately culminating in misplacement of the chloroplast division apparatus . to corroborate our yeast two hybrid results we analyzed _PROTEIN_ protein protein interactions using _METHOD_ resonance energy transfer technology . fret is an energy transfer process from a donor fluorophore to an acceptor fluorophore when donor and acceptor fluorophore are in close proximity it has recently been utilized to analyze live cell events such as calcium ion dynamics and protein protein interactions in planta . on the basis of their spectroscopic properties cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ represent an ideal fret fluorophore pair in vivo energy flow from the donor _METHOD_ to the acceptor _METHOD_ enables capture of _METHOD_ emission upon _METHOD_ excitation . we constructed two vectors _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as a fusion to _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ and transiently _PROTEIN_ these in tobacco leaf cells by particle bombardment . as expected both fusion proteins in their respective _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ channels showed a discrete bright speckle within chloroplasts as observed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in cells where _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were co _PROTEIN_ a significant increase in _METHOD_ intensity was observed upon _METHOD_ excitation in the fret channel as compared with the signal when using single _METHOD_ protein fusions suggesting that fret occurs from the donor _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to the acceptor _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in chloroplasts . to verify these findings we performed acceptor photobleaching experiments by applying high intensity _METHOD_ excitation for a short time period to minimize chloroplast damage . after photobleaching a clear increase of the donor _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in the _METHOD_ regions within chloroplasts showing a reduction in energy transfer which is diagnostic of fret . we detected no increase in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ by this treatment in single fluorophore control experiments but rather a _METHOD_ signal _PROTEIN_ as expected . thus our data show that fret occurred between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and that _PROTEIN_ proteins physically interact inside chloroplasts .
