mitochondrial genomes of plants are much larger than those of mammals and often contain conserved open reading frames of unknown function . here we show that one of these conserved orfs is actually the gene for ribosomal protein _PROTEIN_ in plant . no _PROTEIN_ gene has heretofore been reported in any mitochondrial genome other than the exceptionally gene rich genome of the protist reclinomonas americana . conserved orfs corresponding to _PROTEIN_ are present in a wide diversity of land plant and green algal mitochondrial genomes . the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ genes are transcribed in all nine land plants examined with five seed plant genes subject to rna editing . in addition mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ like cdnas were identified in est libraries from numerous land plants . in three lineages of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is either lost from the mitochondrial genome or a pseudogene . in two of them no _LOCATION_ copy of mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ is identifiably present and instead a second copy of _LOCATION_ encoded chloroplast _PROTEIN_ is present . transient assays using green _METHOD_ protein indicate that this duplicate gene is dual targeted to mitochondria and chloroplasts . we infer that mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ has been functionally replaced by duplicated chloroplast counterparts in brassicaceae and monocots .
an unidentified was reported in the marchantia mitochondrial genome . an homologous sequences has since been reported in the mitochondrial genomes of two other bryophytes and two _METHOD_ termed orf _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . these conserved related sequences are currently annotated as unknown orfs with no evident correspondence to any characterized proteins . we searched for homologues of the marchantia by a blast search and found additional homologous sequences in the mitochondrial dnas of diverse plant groups . altogether sequences homologous to the have now been found in plant species two green algae three bryophytes one gymnosperm and nine _METHOD_ . list of species in which _PROTEIN_ and its potential counterparts were identified in the mitochondrial dnas aminus means no annotation given in the registered sequence . bnucleotide positions are indicated with _PROTEIN_ to the direction of orf . cpseudogene . deach nucleotide positions corresponds a region that showed homology to the entire orf in other _METHOD_ . ethe terminal region of the orf is missing due to a gap upstream of the position . the complete orf has been determined in this study . the locations of the homologues in mitochondrial genomes relative to flanking genes are conserved among green algae and bryophytes to a substantial degree whereas there is no linkage conservation of the homologue to these genes in seed plants . this suggests that an ancestral green plant gene cluster including the homologue was destroyed and each gene within the cluster was dispersed throughout the genome during the evolution of seed plants as reported by li et al . and as found for many other mitochondrial genes in angiosperm . mitochondrial genome organization in the vicinity of orfs that are homologous to of marchantia polymorpha mitochondrial dna . exons of previously characterized genes the orfs potentially encoding the ribosomal protein _PROTEIN_ and other putative orfs are indicated with hatched filled and open boxes respectively . group ii introns are represented by bent lines . positions of trna gene are marked by filled circles . genes encoded in sense and antisense strands are placed above and below the horizontal lines respectively . cdna sequences homologous to the were also found in published est libraries from a fern two _METHOD_ and a number of _METHOD_ . although it has not directly shown that these sequences represent transcripts from mitochondrial genes their high degree of sequence conservation suggests in light of the generally much lower rate of nucleotide substitutions in plant mitochondrial than _LOCATION_ genomes that they probably are mitochondrial gene products . an alignment of protein sequences predicted from the homologues is shown in fig . . these sequences are relatively well conserved despite a few insertions/deletions in their central region . the c terminal region is more divergent with respect to both sequence and length variation . the sequences in bambusa brassica and oryza are probably pseudogenes as they have frame shift mutations or are severely truncated . chaetosphaeridium and tripsacum were omitted from the sequence alignment of fig . and from further analysis because the homologous sequence in chaetosphaeridium was greatly diverged and because tripsacum retains only a short stretch of _PROTEIN_ . alignment of amino acid sequences between previously characterized _PROTEIN_ proteins and the orfs conserved in plant mitochondria . upper _PROTEIN_ from reclinomonas _LOCATION_ and four eubacteria . lower proteins predicted from the marchantia and its homologues in plant mitochondria . identical or similar amino acid residues conserved in > sequences are highlighted . amino acids conserved in two or more non plant species are marked with asterisks . gaps are indicated by dashes . amino acid changes caused by rna editing events which were detected by rt pcr analysis or computationally predicted are denoted with red letters . especially amino acid positions in which the homologies were clearly improved by rna editing are indicated with filled triangles . positions of frame shifts in bambusa and oryza are shown with slashes . note that brassica lacks two thirds of the c terminal conserved region which is replaced by an unrelated amino acid sequence . the length of each orf is given in parentheses . a blast analysis using the predicted protein sequence of the physcomitrella _PROTEIN_ yielded a hit to the ribosomal protein _PROTEIN_ from the proteobacterium rickettsia and other bacteria . we believe that this level of similarity is significant i.e . is indicative of evolutionary homology/common descent for the following reasons . first the database search also detected a conserved domain of the ribosomal superfamily within the physcomitrella sequence . second manual sequence alignment between the already characterized _PROTEIN_ and the proteins predicted from the homologues confirmed that several amino acid residues were clearly conserved between the two sequence groups . third the average length of the homologues in plant mitochondria is amino acids which is quite similar to the length of bacterial _PROTEIN_ . fourth the level of amino acid identity/similarity between the plant orfs and bacterial _PROTEIN_ proteins is similar to that observed between reclinomonas and bacterial _PROTEIN_ proteins . finally this level of conservation is similar to that observed for many mitochondrial ribosomal proteins and their bacterial counterparts _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . given all this we conclude that and its homologues in plant mitochondrial genomes are likely to function as the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ gene in plants . therefore these orfs will be designated as mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ genes hereafter . the _PROTEIN_ of plant mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ was examined by reverse transcription pcr . transcripts from _PROTEIN_ were detected in all nine species investigated two bryophytes one gymnosperm and six _METHOD_ . sequencing of five of the seed plant cdnas revealed and sites of c to t rna editing in cycas carica nicotiana solanum and vitis respectively . these rna editing events result in three seven four three and seven amino acid changes in the predicted proteins respectively five positions of which clearly improve the similarity in the alignment . rna editing events are observed preferentially in protein coding regions of land plant mitochondria at first and second positions in codons and tend to improve the level of protein sequence conservation . seed plant _PROTEIN_ shows the same pattern of rna editing and therefore these results strongly indicate that the _PROTEIN_ gene is probably functional in the _LOCATION_ of these plants . in contrast no rna editing was detectable in the transcripts of brassica and oryza which is consistent with the conclusion drawn in the preceding section that these are probably pseudogenes . as described above mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ gene appears to be a pseudogene in bambusa brassica and oryza whereas no vestige of _PROTEIN_ was found in the complete mitochondrial genome sequences of five _METHOD_ and green algae . moreover for three of these plants there is no evidence of a mitochondrial type _PROTEIN_ gene in both the _LOCATION_ genome and in extensive cdna datasets . therefore it is likely that _PROTEIN_ genes of mitochondrial origin have been completely lost in these species . this is somewhat surprising as the preponderance of genes that have been lost from mitochondrial genomes in _METHOD_ have been functionally transferred to the _LOCATION_ . we hypothesized that the _PROTEIN_ protein might be supplied by a homologous _LOCATION_ gene of chloroplast origin as found for cases of organellar loss of the _PROTEIN_ gene . it has been shown that the _PROTEIN_ gene of chloroplast origin has been transferred to the _LOCATION_ genome in arabidopsis and oryza . our database search showed that sequences homologous to this chloroplast type _PROTEIN_ are present in many other land plants . all of these genes are probably located in the _LOCATION_ because the _PROTEIN_ gene is absent from all chloroplast genomes sequenced to date in land plants . interestingly monocots and brassicaceae species harbour a second copy of the chloroplast type _PROTEIN_ in addition to the putatively original copy that is widely present and conserved among land plants . a phylogenetic analysis showed that the extra copies of the chloroplast type _PROTEIN_ gene in monocots and brassicaceae form two independent clusters each separated from all other examined genes by long branches . this result suggests that the extra copy has diverged rapidly compared with the original chloroplast type gene . judging from their position in the _PROTEIN_ phylogeny the two extra clades of genes may have originated by independent gene duplication events in monocots and brassicaceae . independent origins of the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ genes in monocots and brassicaceae from their respective chloroplast counterparts . an nj phylogenetic tree is based on chloroplast type _PROTEIN_ protein sequences . accession numbers of cdnas and locus tags of genome sequences are shown in brackets following each genus name . when the corresponding sequences are unannotated in the draft genome sequences their locations are specified by the linkage group chromosome number or contig name together with their nucleotide coordinates . the marchantia sequence was used as an outgroup . the second copy of chloroplast _PROTEIN_ in monocots and brassicaceae is shaded . note that sequences homologous to the second copy of chloroplast _PROTEIN_ were also found in hordeum musa panicum raphanus and triticum but they are not included in the nj tree because of incompleteness of their coding regions . numbers on the nodes are bootstrap values from replicates . genetic distance is shown with a _PROTEIN_ bar . the alignment of the chloroplast type _PROTEIN_ revealed that the n terminal sequence of the second copy is totally different from that of the original copy and is also non homologous even between the monocots and brassicaceae groups . because the n terminal region generally serves as a protein targeting signal the distinct n terminal sequences of the second set of _PROTEIN_ proteins may imply a difference of their targeting property . proteome analyses in arabidopsis and spinacia have shown that the original widely present chloroplast type _PROTEIN_ is indeed targeted to chloroplasts whereas cleavage of the n terminal transit peptide region has been observed in spinacia . in contrast no such information has been obtained for the second copy of this gene . the second copy may have a short or no cleavable targeting sequence at its n terminal region considering the position of the cleavage site of the original copy . protein localization predictions with predotar targetp and wolf psort provided contradictory results with respect to this second copy . therefore we examined its subcellular localization in vivo using _METHOD_ . a fusion protein containing _METHOD_ and the n terminal region of the second chloroplast type _PROTEIN_ copy from arabidopsis was clearly localized to mitochondria suggesting its mitochondrial localization in vivo . in addition however _METHOD_ signals were also detected in chloroplasts . similar results were obtained using the oryza sequence . therefore the second chloroplast derived _PROTEIN_ proteins in arabidopsis and oryza seem to undergo dual targeting into both organelles . dual targeting has been found for a number of plant organellar proteins including one other ribosomal protein . subcellular localization in arabidopsis leaf epidermal cells of _METHOD_ fusion proteins having the n terminal portion of the second chloroplast like _PROTEIN_ copy from

indicated by yellow and pink arrowheads respectively . scale bar . an enlarged portion of the same small subportion of each image is shown below the set of four full images . on the basis of the data obtained in this study we propose a model for the evolution of the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ gene . this gene was originally present only in the mitochondrial genome . it was lost from the mitochondrial genome early in the evolution of most eukaryotic lineages but has been retained in mitochondria of the protist reclinomonas and certain plants . indeed many diverse plants still possess an intact and probably functional _PROTEIN_ gene in their mitochondrial genomes . in contrast the chloroplast _PROTEIN_ gene was transferred to the _LOCATION_ early in eukaryotic evolution as no green plant chloroplast genomes still contain this gene . a model for the evolution of _PROTEIN_ genes of mitochondrial and chloroplast origin . three predicted evolutionary stages with _PROTEIN_ to the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ gene are shown . the proposed evolutionary direction is indicated with _PROTEIN_ arrows . _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and chloroplast are represented by an octagon a rounded rectangle and an oval respectively . an intact gene a pseudogene and loss of the gene are denoted with a plus and a minus respectively . the second copy of the _LOCATION_ gene encoding chloroplast _PROTEIN_ is shown by a circled plus sign . targeting of proteins produced by the _LOCATION_ encoded genes is indicated with arrows . genera possibly or ambiguously belong to each of the three stages are shown in parentheses or by a double headed arrow . subsequently a duplication of the _LOCATION_ located chloroplast derived _PROTEIN_ gene occurred whose protein product appears to functionally compensate for mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ in certain plants . the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ gene has become a pseudogene in some plants and has been entirely lost from the mitochondrial genome in others . extensive cdna and _LOCATION_ genomic sequence data suggest that monocots and brassicaceae no longer contain mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ in any genome . our _METHOD_ assay demonstrated that the product of an extra copy of the _LOCATION_ gene for chloroplast _PROTEIN_ is imported into both mitochondria and chloroplasts in arabidopsis and oryza . these results strongly suggest that the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ has been functionally replaced probably twice independently by the duplicated chloroplast counterpart in monocots and some brassicaceae lineage . functionality of the second copy in raphanus is presently ambiguous as all four homologous cdnas of wild radish that are in genbank _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ have either a frame shift mutation or an internal stop codon . in this species an additional copy of the second copy of the chloroplast derived _PROTEIN_ gene may exist in the _LOCATION_ genome . a phylogenetic analysis of all available brassicaceae cdna sequences of the second copy does indeed suggest that it has been subject to further duplications in the brassicaceae including raphanus . during the years since the first complete mitochondrial genome was reported from plants the liverwort marchantia polymorpha comparative genomic data have allowed the identification of a number of genes that were previously known only as unidentified orfs . in the case of ribosomal proteins ribosomal protein genes were initially identified in the marchantia mitochondrial genome and this is the first case of the subsequent identification of any new ribosomal protein genes in marchantia or any other land plant mitochondrial genome . the present study shows that plants are the only group of eukaryote other than reclinomonas that still retain _PROTEIN_ in their mitochondrial genomes and furthermore that the evolution of _PROTEIN_ within plants has taken some unusual and interesting turns .
sequences homologous to of marchantia polymorpha mitochondria dna were searched by blast algorithm via the national center for biotechnology information website . genes for chloroplast _PROTEIN_ were searched in the ncbi database using sequences of arabidopsis and oryza as queries . nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences were aligned manually with bioedit ver . . a sequence alignment of chloroplast _PROTEIN_ was used for construction of a neighbour joining phylogenetic tree after removing gaps and poorly conserved regions . the nj tree was constructed using clustalw ver . via a dna data bank of japan website . bootstrap values were computed from replicates . leaves of chinese cabbage _PROTEIN_ cycad grape papaya rice tobacco _PROTEIN_ and tomato and thalli of liverwort and hornwort were used for plant materials . total dna and total rna were extracted with dneasy plant mini kit and rneasy plant mini kit respectively . total rna was treated with rnase free dnase i . first strand cdnas were synthesized using random hexamer primers and the advantage rt for pcr kit as described previously . the resulting cdnas were used for pcr amplifications with a primer pair in carica nicotiana and vitis . primer pairs and were used in oryza brassica and cycas respectively . the pcr products were cloned into a pcr xl topo vector and independent cdna clones were sequenced for each species to detect any potential rna editing events . sequences encoding the first and residues of chloroplast like _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis and oryza were amplified by pcr with primer pairs and respectively and fused in frame with the upstream region of a synthetic green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . the resultant constructs were introduced into arabidopsis epidermal cells using a _PROTEIN_ particle delivery system . mitochondria were labelled with an mt dsred construct in which the _METHOD_ orf in a pws plasmid _PROTEIN_ was replaced by dsred . transient _PROTEIN_ of the introduced proteins and chloroplast _METHOD_ were visualized with a confocal spectral laser scanning microscope nikon as reported previously . primers used in this study are as follows . small letters represent nucleotide deviations to introduce ncoi and sali restriction sites . ggagtcagt ttcttt _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gaacggccccatggcctcccacc ggagtcagt ttcttt aagatcgag _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tcttcccgacc ggagaatccgctaggctgaggt tagatgaatcgacctctggacagat ctcaggaaagggataacctgaga gaatctcggtcgacctcacagtttc tggctccatggactcccatttggtt gccgtcgacgatgacgtccgtg gaacggccccatggcctcccacc
