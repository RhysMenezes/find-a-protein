we have identified two _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ associated arabidopsis proteins _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ which are conserved among most species . _METHOD_ protein fusions of _METHOD_ localised to the _LOCATION_ in plant cells and over _PROTEIN_ induced the formation of a _LOCATION_ structure identified as _LOCATION_ whorls by electron microscopy . hydrophobicity analysis suggested that _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ are integral _LOCATION_ proteins bearing six transmembrane domains . _LOCATION_ protein topology was assessed by a redox based topology assay with redox sensitive _METHOD_ and confirmed by a protease protection assay . a major loop domain between transmembrane domains and plus the n and c termini were found on the _LOCATION_ side of the _LOCATION_ . a c terminal di lysine motif is involved in retrieval of _METHOD_ and deletion led to a reduction of the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signal in the _LOCATION_ . over _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ truncations perturbed _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ morphology and similar effects were also seen when _METHOD_ were knocked down by rna interference . microscopy and biochemical experiments suggested that _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ truncations inhibited _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ protein transport .
arabidopsis has two homologues of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the two proteins are very similar and have the same predicted _LOCATION_ topology . hydrophobicity prediction _PROTEIN_ suggests that _METHOD_ have six transmembrane domains and this feature is conserved among most species . a snare associated domain was found in the protein and a major cytoplasmic loop region resides between and . a conserved peptide sequence between arabidopsis and drosophila was found within the loop region . _METHOD_ was fused to yellow or green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _METHOD_ on its n and c termini and localized to a tubular/cisternal network which co localized with _METHOD_ hdel confirming it to be an _LOCATION_ protein . over _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ induced bright spherical _LOCATION_ structures which on reduction of amplitude and gain settings were observed to be small _LOCATION_ like structures with diameters from up to . similar results were described by citation for the rat homologue . these _LOCATION_ structures were also found in stable arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . electron microscopy revealed that these spherical _LOCATION_ structures were most likely derived from whorls of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ enclosing cytoplasm . these structures were motile and movement was inhibited on treatment with latrunculin b to depolymerise the actin _LOCATION_ but their morphology appeared unaffected by the secretory inhibitor brefeldin a . when _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was co _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ an _LOCATION_ marker the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labelled punctate structures were sometimes found inside the _LOCATION_ whorls . these findings were confirmed by em where _LOCATION_ bodies were found both in and outside the _LOCATION_ whorls . when _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was co _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was located to the _LOCATION_ of the whorls as well as _LOCATION_ bodies . the movement and morphology of the _PROTEIN_ labelled _LOCATION_ appeared normal and the over _PROTEIN_ of tagged _METHOD_ had no other visible effect on the early secretory pathway . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was also located on the _LOCATION_ . over _PROTEIN_ did not induce _LOCATION_ whorl formation and had no visible effect on the _LOCATION_ relationship at the confocal microscope level . however _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ induced cisternal _LOCATION_ formation . a similar effect was described previously when _METHOD_ calnexin _METHOD_ was over _PROTEIN_ . a redox sensitive green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ which has different excitation peaks according to the local glutathione redox potential in different subcellular compartments was used to determine the _LOCATION_ topology of _METHOD_ . the reduced form of _METHOD_ predominantly excites at nm while the oxidized form excites more efficiently at nm . due to the difference in the egsh across the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ can be used as a sensor for _LOCATION_ protein topology . _METHOD_ constructs with _METHOD_ attached to either the n or c termini were made and transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco . free _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ hdel were used as the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ lumen controls respectively . ratiometric analysis of the nm images shows a low _METHOD_ ratio of for _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ indicating a reducing environment . in contrast a high ratio of indicated that the _METHOD_ hdel was in an oxidising environment _LOCATION_ . both _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were excited more efficiently at nm than at nm and the resulting nm _METHOD_ ratio was and respectively . this was similar to the pattern of _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . therefore both n and c termini of _METHOD_ are _LOCATION_ . in addition a _METHOD_ truncation without and was made and _METHOD_ was fused to the n terminus of within the _METHOD_ . although the over _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ truncations without the loop domain disturbs the _LOCATION_ structure _PROTEIN_ the ratiometric analysis indicated that the n terminus of known as the loop domain was also _LOCATION_ . as a further control was applied to tobacco leaves _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions . the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ oxidised upon treatment with a resultant excitation peak shift to nm . in parallel protein topology was confirmed using a protease protection assay . the _LOCATION_ microsomes were prepared from tobacco leaves over _PROTEIN_ the n or c terminal _METHOD_ tagged _METHOD_ . in the presence of proteinase k luminal _METHOD_ will be protected by the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ from cleavage and _METHOD_ will only be digested if exposed to the _LOCATION_ . as a negative control we used _METHOD_ calnexin with the _METHOD_ facing the _LOCATION_ lumen and calnexin _METHOD_ _METHOD_ with the _METHOD_ on the _LOCATION_ face of the _LOCATION_ was used as a positive control . the digestion products were analyzed by western blotting with an anti _METHOD_ antibody . the pk treatment resulted in complete loss of the calnexin _METHOD_ band a result consistent with the known topology of the calnexin construct . the band of _METHOD_ calnexin ran faster after proteinase treatment as predicted because the _LOCATION_ tail of calnexin is digested leaving the tm and fused luminal _METHOD_ intact . after pk treatment _METHOD_ with n or c terminal _METHOD_ fusions was not detectable on the blot which again indicated that the n and c termini of _METHOD_ are cytoplasmic . c terminal di lysine motifs are believed to play a role in _LOCATION_ retrieval by interacting with _PROTEIN_ proteins . type i _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins lacking this motif are often unable to localize correctly and may be secreted . the _METHOD_ protein minus the c terminal amino acids including the tri lysine motif was generated and fused to _METHOD_ to examine the role of this motif in _LOCATION_ retention . the confocal results show that the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ labelled _LOCATION_ demonstrates a much weaker _METHOD_ than the full length _METHOD_ _METHOD_ when same agrobacterium tumefaciens infiltration od and confocal settings were applied . under the same conditions the average _METHOD_ intensity was measured as for _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in contrast to an intensity of for _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . a _METHOD_ truncation minus the c terminal amino acids but retaining the kkk motif _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was also made and fused to _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ of this construct showed the average _METHOD_ intensity to be high at . these results suggested that the _LOCATION_ retention of _METHOD_ lacking the c terminal kkk motif is less effective than the full length protein and the post kkk c terminal peptide was not involved in this process . the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was enhanced after h bfa incubation to indicating that the protein is not intrinsically unstable and can built up in the _LOCATION_ . the effect of bfa on other constructs was minor . to study the function of _METHOD_ and its influence on the secretory pathway various _METHOD_ truncation mutants were made and _PROTEIN_ as dominant negatives . as the functional domains of _METHOD_ are unclear two versions of the truncated protein were constructed . a predicted snare protein associated domain was found between amino acids and in _METHOD_ . n terminal _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ fusions of _METHOD_ lacking this domain _METHOD_ were made and transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaf epidermal cells . when _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was co _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ calnexin both protein fusions labelled the same structure . however the _LOCATION_ appeared aggregated . after longer co _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ became fragmented and deformed into small globular structures . at the ultrastructural level spherical _LOCATION_ structures were abundant which correspond to the deformed _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fragments seen by confocal microscopy . other _LOCATION_ structures were identified by em such as a swollen _LOCATION_ presumably _LOCATION_ derived surrounded by several layers of _LOCATION_ like _LOCATION_ . in cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were redistributed into the _LOCATION_ aggregates and co located with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the mobility of the remaining _LOCATION_ bodies was greatly reduced when _METHOD_ truncations were _PROTEIN_ because _LOCATION_ bodies trapped in the _LOCATION_ clumps were not free to move . _LOCATION_ movement was analysed in control and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ leaves and _PROTEIN_ as cumulative distribution frequency plots which give an accurate descriptor of organelle movement . as can be seen in figure although _LOCATION_ body velocity is not significantly altered both displacement and meandering index show a significant reduction under mutant _PROTEIN_ . _LOCATION_ morphology in _METHOD_ mutant _PROTEIN_ cells differed from wild type _LOCATION_ stacks by em as their stacks appeared to be more vesicular with tubules often extending from the periphery of cisternae . _LOCATION_ or trans _LOCATION_ network remnant like structures were also found in the presence of _METHOD_ . a peptide sequence is highly conserved between arabidopsis _METHOD_ and its drosophila homologue and overlaps with the predicted snare associated domain at the cytoplasmic loop region . as most functional domains across different _METHOD_ share similar sequences we postulated that this conserved sequence may contain functional domains . unlike _METHOD_ which is missing _METHOD_ has a similar _LOCATION_ topology to the full length protein with six tmds and part of the cytoplasmic loop region . the truncation was fused to _METHOD_ and transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaves . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ over _PROTEIN_ produced a similar effect to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ such as _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ aggregation and deformation . different sized swollen _LOCATION_ structures were found by em in tobacco _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . such an effect is able to be partially rescued by over _PROTEIN_ full length _METHOD_ . _LOCATION_ markers were redistributed to the perturbed _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . considering the size and the location of the loop region in the native protein it is proposed that this region or at least a part of the region of the native _METHOD_ protein contains an active domain with unknown function . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labelled _LOCATION_ tended to relocate to the _LOCATION_ when co _PROTEIN_ with either _METHOD_ truncation . however the result was slightly different when the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was used as the _LOCATION_ marker . in the presence of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ did not redistribute to the _LOCATION_ but formed large aggregates or mini _LOCATION_ bodies _LOCATION_ . at the ultrastructural level _LOCATION_ fragments were abundant and the size of _LOCATION_ bodies was reduced by about half to nm . _LOCATION_ fragments also appeared intermingled with _LOCATION_ in the presence of the _METHOD_ mutant . to test that the different results of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were not due to _PROTEIN_ levels of _METHOD_ truncations untagged _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ alongside _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . because of the significant change of _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ morphology it was easy to distinguish cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ truncations . in cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was relocated to _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ aggregates . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was not found in any of these _LOCATION_ aggregates but labelled what were assumed to be _LOCATION_ remnants . _METHOD_ without the conserved domain was made and fused to _METHOD_ at its c terminus . unlike the full length protein which distributes evenly over the _LOCATION_ network the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ truncation localised to small punctate structures and its over _PROTEIN_ dramatically changed the _LOCATION_ morphology . the _LOCATION_ became swollen or fragmented into globular structures similar to the _METHOD_ truncation but in this case these structures were interlinked by _LOCATION_ tubules containing _METHOD_ hdel . when _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was co _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ calnexin most of the large punctate structures co localised with calnexin which indicated they were a part of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . however smaller punctae did not co localise with calnexin . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not label the _LOCATION_ when _PROTEIN_ alone however its signal accumulated in the _LOCATION_ when co _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the remaining _LOCATION_ bodies appeared normal by confocal microscopy except for occasional co localization with the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ punctae . tobacco leaves appeared senescent days after infiltration of the _METHOD_ mutants however such an effect was not exhibited by _METHOD_ mutant over _PROTEIN_ . the redistribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to the _LOCATION_ suggested that _METHOD_ truncations block protein secretion from the _LOCATION_ . in order to confirm this result other approaches were taken . the secretory marker _METHOD_ weakly labels the _LOCATION_ with the _METHOD_ being enhanced when secretion is blocked . when _METHOD_ was co _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ mutants its _METHOD_ accumulated in the _LOCATION_ indicating a secretion blockage . the over _PROTEIN_ of the full length _METHOD_ did not exhibit such strong inhibition on _METHOD_ . in comparison the _METHOD_ intensity of _METHOD_ control is lower . a similar effect was also seen with a pulse chase assay using tobacco protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ truncations alongside a secretory version of phaseolin . the influence of the _METHOD_ truncation on secretion was further studied using _METHOD_ recovery after photobleaching . _LOCATION_ bodies in tobacco leaf cells co _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ as well as _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ alone were bleached . samples were treated with latrunculin b to depolymerise actin . earlier studies showed that _LOCATION_ protein transport from the _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ does not require the actin _LOCATION_ . in the presence of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ the maximum _METHOD_ recovery of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ reached after bleaching which was significantly reduced compared with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ single _PROTEIN_ . the initial rate of _METHOD_ recovery was similar but the recovery rate of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cells slowed after sec . a hairpin rna _PROTEIN_ construct of _METHOD_ was stably transformed into arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ markers and positive arabidopsis lines were confirmed by rt pcr . the specificity of the rnai construct was confirmed by rt pcr using both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ primers with total cdna from either _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ rnai lines . the mrna level of _METHOD_ remained the same in both wild type arabidopsis and _METHOD_ rnai lines _METHOD_ . the structure of the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ was studied by confocal microscopy . in wild type arabidopsis _LOCATION_ bodies moved over the cortical tubular _LOCATION_ network . however when native arabidopsis _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was knocked down the _LOCATION_ morphology changed dramatically . _LOCATION_ morphology also appeared to be affected forming _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ aggregates and fragments . tubule like structures associated with single _LOCATION_ bodies or _LOCATION_ aggregates were also seen . in parallel rnai knock down of _METHOD_ was performed . the morphology of the _LOCATION_ was less perturbed however many constrictions were seen on the _LOCATION_ tubules and the structure of the _LOCATION_ tubular network was different from the wild type . however _LOCATION_ body structure appeared to be unaffected . the arabidopsis _METHOD_ rnai line exhibited growth defects with shorter roots than the wild type . such effects were not significant in arabidopsis _METHOD_ rnai lines .
