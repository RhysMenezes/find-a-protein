rho family small _PROTEIN_ are signaling switches controlling many eukaryotic cellular processes . conversion from the gdp to _PROTEIN_ bound form is catalyzed by guanine nucleotide exchange _PROTEIN_ . rho gefs in animals fall into two structurally distinct classes containing dh and docker catalytic domains . using a plant rho _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as bait in yeast two hybrid screens we identified a family of rho gefs named ropgefs . the arabidopsis thaliana ropgef family of members contains a conserved central domain the domain of unknown function _PROTEIN_ and variable n and c terminal regions . in vitro gef assays show that _PROTEIN_ but not the full length version of _PROTEIN_ has high gef activity toward _PROTEIN_ . our data suggest that the variable regions of _PROTEIN_ are involved in regulation of ropgef through an autoinhibitory mechanism . _PROTEIN_ overexpression in pollen tubes produced growth depolarization as does a constitutively active _PROTEIN_ mutant . the _PROTEIN_ overexpression phenotype was suppressed by _PROTEIN_ of a dominant negative mutant of _PROTEIN_ probably by trapping _PROTEIN_ . deletion mutant analysis suggested a requirement of ropgef activity for the function of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ growth . green _METHOD_ protein tagged _PROTEIN_ was localized to the tip of pollen tubes where _PROTEIN_ is activated . these results provide strong evidence that _PROTEIN_ activates _PROTEIN_ in control of _PROTEIN_ growth in pollen tubes .
in general gefs preferentially bind nucleotide free and gdp bound _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ . to identify potential ropgefs we conducted a yeast two hybrid screen using a dominant negative mutant of _PROTEIN_ as bait . to generate the bait construct site directed mutagenesis was used to create a dominant negative form of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ containing a mutation . a mutation within the c terminal isoprenylation motif was introduced into dn _PROTEIN_ to prevent its association with the pm . a total of putative positive colonies were selected by their ability to grow on selective plates and for galactosidase activity using a filter lift assay from a total of million transformants screened . we recovered and sequenced constructs from this collection . among those sequenced were partial cdnas encoding two families of plant specific proteins . in this study we focused on a family of members containing a highly conserved central region with amino acid residues annotated as _PROTEIN_ . during the preparation of this report citation reported the same family of _PROTEIN_ containing proteins and named arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ members _PROTEIN_ through _PROTEIN_ . for consistency and brevity we adopted berken et al . 's nomenclature . fourteen of the cdna clones corresponded to three distinct ropgef proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . to confirm the interaction between ropgef proteins and dn _PROTEIN_ partial cdna clones were subcloned into maltose binding protein fusion vectors . in vitro pull down assays confirmed the interaction between these three ropgef proteins and dn _PROTEIN_ . amino acid sequence alignment of the ropgefs from arabidopsis showed that the n and c terminal regions outside of the _PROTEIN_ domain are highly variable . the _PROTEIN_ domain can be divided into three highly conserved subdomains separated by two short stretches of variable amino acid residues . database searches reveal that the ropgefs are present in various plant species . the rice genome encodes at least ropgefs . database searches have failed to identify any homologs of ropgefs from nonplant _METHOD_ suggesting that ropgef is a plant specific gene family . as a first step in testing the functional relationship between _PROTEIN_ and ropgefs we examined whether any of these ropgefs are _PROTEIN_ in mature pollen because _PROTEIN_ is specifically _PROTEIN_ in pollen and is known to control pollen tube growth . rt pcr analysis showed that five ropgef genes were _PROTEIN_ in mature pollen . we then investigated which of these ropgefs interacted with _PROTEIN_ using an in vitro pull down assay . the predicted coding sequences of these five ropgef genes were fused to the c terminus of mbp . purified fusion proteins were pulled down with _PROTEIN_ bound gdp bound or nucleotide free _METHOD_ of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein and detected using an anti mbp antibody . despite numerous attempts we were unable to _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ fusion protein in escherichia coli therefore we only include four ropgefs in our interaction assays . as shown in figure ropgef fusion proteins exhibited differential interactions with different _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ in vitro . _PROTEIN_ preferentially interacted with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ preferentially interacted with gdp _PROTEIN_ . interestingly _PROTEIN_ only interacted with gdp bound and nucleotide free _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ did not interact with any form of _PROTEIN_ although _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ share identity at the amino acid sequence level . since _PROTEIN_ differentially interacted with the gdp bound and nucleotide free _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ we suspected that the ropgef gene family might encode unconventional rho gefs for rops . to assay gef activity we used a _METHOD_ spectroscopy based procedure for measuring nucleotide replacement on or dissociation from _PROTEIN_ proteins . _PROTEIN_ protein was preloaded with unlabeled gdp and the gef reaction was started by the addition of gef proteins and _METHOD_ labeled n methylanthraniloyl gdp . the incorporation rate for this nucleotide analog indicates gef activity . for a positive control we used sope an unconventional rho gef from the bacterial enteropathogen s. typhimurium . the intrinsic nucleotide replacement rate for gdp _PROTEIN_ was faster than that of human gdp . sope was active on both human and arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ . we chose _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for the in vitro gef assay since they had differential interaction patterns with _PROTEIN_ . the full length _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were purified as recombinant mbp fusion proteins and then cleaved by _PROTEIN_ xa to remove mbp . interestingly the full length _PROTEIN_ displayed no gef activity whereas _PROTEIN_ showed low but consistent gef activity toward _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ activity toward _PROTEIN_ showed measurable increase upon increasing concentration of _PROTEIN_ . the ability of _PROTEIN_ to promote nucleotide exchange is consistent with its preferential interaction with gdp bound and nucleotide free _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ . we next tested whether the _PROTEIN_ domain which is highly conserved in all ropgef members from different plant species possesses the catalytic function of ropgef . we suspected that the lack of ropgef activity for _PROTEIN_ might be due to the presence of ropgef inhibitory elements in the variable regions . thus we generated truncated _PROTEIN_ containing only the _PROTEIN_ domain and assayed its gef activity . indeed this _PROTEIN_ domain had a high ropgef activity toward _PROTEIN_ . the apparent rate constant kobs was determined by fitting data to a single exponential function using peakfit . the rate constant increased with _PROTEIN_ domain concentrations in an apparently hyperbolic manner . the data obtained could be fitted to a hyperbolic function and kmax was determined to be . the _PROTEIN_ domain of _PROTEIN_ stimulates the nucleotide dissociation from _PROTEIN_ fold . these results indicate that the _PROTEIN_ domain is sufficient for the catalysis of nucleotide exchange on _PROTEIN_ . to test whether the complete _PROTEIN_ domain is required for its gef activity we constructed two truncated fragments of _PROTEIN_ and both fragments lack part of the _PROTEIN_ domain . both fragments have completely lost gef activity toward _PROTEIN_ . based on these results we conclude that the ropgefs belong to a novel family of plant specific rho gefs and that the conserved _PROTEIN_ domain is most likely a ropgef catalytic domain . our results are consistent with those of citation who used a slightly larger fragment of the _PROTEIN_ domain for gef activity assays . the full length _PROTEIN_ had no in vitro gef activity whereas the conserved _PROTEIN_ domain of this ropgef had a high ropgef activity toward _PROTEIN_ suggesting that the variable n and/or c terminal regions contain regulatory motifs/sequences that are inhibitory to the ropgef catalytic domain . to assess which regions contain the putative regulatory elements we generated two truncated _PROTEIN_ that lack the n terminal and c terminal regions respectively . as shown in figure deletion of the c terminal region induced ropgef activity to the degree similar to or slightly stronger than that of the _PROTEIN_ domain whereas removing the n terminal region partially activated gef for _PROTEIN_ . these results suggest that the inhibitory regulatory element primarily resides in the c terminal region while the n terminal region may assist in the inhibition of ropgef activity mediated by the c terminal region . to test whether the c terminal region of _PROTEIN_ confers the inhibitory effect by interacting with part of the gef catalytic domain we tested the ability of the c terminal variable region to bind various truncated fragments of _PROTEIN_ in vitro . the _PROTEIN_ domain can be divided into three subdomains separated by short stretches of variable sequences which was the basis of our design for the truncated fragment of _PROTEIN_ . as shown in figure the c terminal region interacts with _PROTEIN_ at its truncated fragments in a complex manner . first it strongly interacted with the full length _PROTEIN_ as well as the c terminal fragment g that contains the c terminal part of the _PROTEIN_ domain and the c terminal variable region . second it weakly interacted with the following truncated fragments fragment h fragment i and fragment k . third it did not bind to any of the following truncated fragments fragment b through fragment f and fragment j . these results demonstrate that the c terminal region is capable of strong direct binding to a domain or motif located in the c terminal part of _PROTEIN_ but does not bind to subdomains and of the _PROTEIN_ domain . the c terminal interactive domain/motif _METHOD_ to cover part of subdomain of the _PROTEIN_ domain and part of the c terminal variable region itself because either one alone bound weakly to the c terminal variable region . the strong interaction is inhibited by the presence of subdomains and/or because fragment e and fragment f had no interaction with the c terminal variable region . moreover this inhibition is released by the n terminal variable region based on the _PROTEIN_ that the full length _PROTEIN_ is able to interact . these data are consistent with the observation that the removal of the c terminal variable region completely releases the inhibition of _PROTEIN_ activity whereas the deletion of the n terminal variable region partially releases the inhibition . to test whether the binding of the c terminal variable region to the _PROTEIN_ domain physically blocks gef activity we mixed the _PROTEIN_ domain with fragment g k or h. neither fragment had a significant effect on the gef activity of the _PROTEIN_ domain . this suggests that the autoinhibitory mechanism most likely requires conformational changes that could result from an intramolecular interaction between the c terminal region and the _PROTEIN_ domain . we next investigated whether _PROTEIN_ functionally activates _PROTEIN_ in the control of _PROTEIN_ growth in pollen tubes . available single t dna insertional knockout mutants for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ did not show any measurable defects in the growth of cultured pollen tubes or in pollination suggesting that two or more of these ropgefs _PROTEIN_ in pollen are functionally redundant . thus we resorted to a gain of function approach by overexpressing ropgefs in tobacco pollen tubes . previously we found that _PROTEIN_ of a constitutively active _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ caused severe depolarization of pollen tube growth leading to the formation of bulbous tubes while overexpression of wild type _PROTEIN_ induced less severe depolarization of growth in pollen tubes both in tobacco and arabidopsis . to facilitate monitoring of ropgef _PROTEIN_ and ropgef subcellular localization we tagged ropgefs with green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . as shown in figure transient overexpression of each of the five ropgefs induced growth depolarization in tobacco pollen tubes with _PROTEIN_ causing the most severe phenotype . _PROTEIN_ overexpression produced a bulbous pollen tube a phenotype similar to that induced by ca _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ overexpression phenotype is similar to that of a tomato ropgef/kpp which interacts with the kinase domain of le _PROTEIN_ . for every ropgef examined the _METHOD_ ropgef fusion gene and the ropgef gene alone produced identical or nearly identical phenotypes when overexpressed under the pollen specific promoter suggesting that _METHOD_ ropgef fusion genes are fully functional . to assess subcellular localization of ropgefs tobacco pollen tubes _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ropgef fusions were examined using confocal microscopy . as shown in figure _METHOD_ alone was distributed evenly in the pollen tube cytoplasm . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was highly restricted to the apical region of the pm a pattern similar to the localization of activated _PROTEIN_ . however _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was barely detected in the pollen tube pm . interestingly _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were localized to the apical region of the pollen tube pm . these results indicate that different ropgefs are localized differentially in pollen tubes and that _PROTEIN_ signaling may be regulated by multiple ropgefs in pollen tubes . furthermore we selectively overexpressed _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis pollen and multiple transgenic lines of _PROTEIN_ overexpression produced bulbous pollen tubes similar to that of _PROTEIN_ overexpression . the overexpression phenotype and localization pattern of these ropgefs resemble those of _PROTEIN_ indicating that they may be the activators of _PROTEIN_ in the control of _PROTEIN_ growth . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ induced the most severe depolarization of pollen tubes and our biochemical analysis of ropgefs mostly came from the use of _PROTEIN_ therefore we focused on _PROTEIN_ for testing its functional relationship with _PROTEIN_ . we assessed whether there was a tight correlation between ropgef activity and the ability to cause depolarized growth among various truncated fragments of _PROTEIN_ . various truncated fragments of _PROTEIN_ were fused with _METHOD_ and transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco pollen tubes . as shown in figure all fragments retaining the intact _PROTEIN_ domain and ropgef activity caused growth depolarization when overexpressed . the severity of growth depolarization is similar to that of full length _PROTEIN_ or ca _PROTEIN_ . by contrast none of the fragments that lack the intact _PROTEIN_ domain and/or ropgef activity induced depolarization . these results strongly suggest that the ropgef activity of _PROTEIN_ is required for the function of _PROTEIN_ in the regulation of pollen tube growth implying that _PROTEIN_ activation by _PROTEIN_ is critical for _PROTEIN_ growth in pollen tubes . to assess whether there was a correlation between ropgef activity and localization pattern among various truncated fragments of _PROTEIN_ we examined the localization of _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ fragments . as shown in figure various _PROTEIN_ fragments showed differential localization patterns . first the fragment with the c terminal variable region deleted was the only one that showed the exact same tip pm localization pattern as the full length _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . second both the _PROTEIN_ domain and the fragment with the n terminal variable region deleted expanded their pm localization all over the pollen tube . third all fragments that lack the intact _PROTEIN_ domain displayed similar localization as the _METHOD_ control except that the fragment showed pm localization on the side of pollen tubes but not at the extreme tip . thus the n terminal variable region _METHOD_ to contain a regulatory element that restricts _PROTEIN_ localization to the exact tip region of the pm . the _PROTEIN_ domain is not only required for its activation of _PROTEIN_ but also is essential for the proper targeting of _PROTEIN_ to the pm where _PROTEIN_ is located . to further test whether _PROTEIN_ activates _PROTEIN_ in vivo we examined the effect of and dn _PROTEIN_ on the pollen tube phenotype induced by _PROTEIN_ overexpression . we reasoned that if _PROTEIN_ acts as a _PROTEIN_ activator the _PROTEIN_ induced growth depolarization phenotype should be suppressed by or dn _PROTEIN_ which inhibits _PROTEIN_ activation by promoting _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis or by trapping _PROTEIN_ activator respectively . coexpression suppressed _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ induced growth depolarization by reducing the width of tubes . furthermore dramatically reduced _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localization to the pm . dn _PROTEIN_ coexpression also reduced the pm localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and the tube width from to although dn _PROTEIN_ was not as effective as . to test whether the effect is specific for _PROTEIN_ we coexpressed _PROTEIN_ with a dominant negative mutant of _PROTEIN_ which has been shown to be functionally distinct from _PROTEIN_ . indeed coexpression of dn _PROTEIN_ had no effect on _PROTEIN_ overexpression phenotype or localization . taken together our data strongly suggest that _PROTEIN_ acts as a _PROTEIN_ activator by stimulating its gdp _PROTEIN_ exchange .
