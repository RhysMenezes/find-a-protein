the _PROTEIN_ family of small _PROTEIN_ are central regulators of important cellular processes in plants . _PROTEIN_ is an ancient member of the _PROTEIN_ gene family in arabidopsis thaliana whose functions are generally unknown . in order to study the spatial _PROTEIN_ pattern of the _PROTEIN_ gene transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ gus or _METHOD_ under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter were analysed . functional analysis of _PROTEIN_ was done using transgenic plants overexpressing wild type and constitutively activated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and an _PROTEIN_ dna insertion mutant . the _PROTEIN_ promoter directs a highly specific xylem specific _PROTEIN_ in the root hypocotyl stem and leaves . the _PROTEIN_ is developmentally limited to the _PROTEIN_ stages of xylem differentiation and coincides with the formation of secondary cell walls . leaf epidermal cells of transgenic plants overexpressing constitutively active _PROTEIN_ exhibited highly impaired lobe formation suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is able to regulate _PROTEIN_ cell expansion . finally _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins were localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the results indicate a role for _PROTEIN_ in the development of secondary cell walls of xylem vessels .
a gene fragment kb of the upstream promoter region of _PROTEIN_ containing the first bp of the coding sequence was amplified using pcr from genomic dna . the fragment was cloned into a vector and the sequence was confirmed to be identical to the sequence published by the a. thaliana genome project . the _PROTEIN_ promoter was then cloned in binary vectors upstream of gus or _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ and the constructs were used for transformation of arabidopsis plants . homozygous lines were produced and the dna of these plants was confirmed to contain the correct construct by pcr of isolated dna with primer pairs specific for each construct . in order to study the functional roles of _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants overexpressing wild type or constitutively active _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were produced . the _PROTEIN_ overexpressing construct encompasses the complete coding sequence including parts of the and utr . site directed mutagenesis _PROTEIN_ was used to produce constitutively activated _PROTEIN_ . substitution of glycine with valine in position of _PROTEIN_ inactivates the intrinsic _PROTEIN_ activity thereby keeping the mutant protein permanently in its active _PROTEIN_ bound state . these constructs were _PROTEIN_ under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . several homozygous transgenic lines were obtained for each construct and two lines showing similar phenotypic properties were chosen for more detailed analysis . a t dna insertion mutant of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was obtained from the gabi kat collection . t dna was inserted in the third exon of _PROTEIN_ leading to the truncation of _PROTEIN_ after amino acids . earlier studies indicated that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ at low levels . rt pcr analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was absent in _PROTEIN_ and strongly increased in two ca _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines . dna microarray experiments verified that ca _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels were fold up regulated in the line ca _PROTEIN_ compared with wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels . transgenic _PROTEIN_ gus arabidopsis plants were grown on both _METHOD_ agar medium and soil and the gus _PROTEIN_ pattern was analysed at all major developmental stages . gus staining was generally observed to be stronger in plants grown on agar medium than in soil . figure shows the gus activity patterns in roots leaves and _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ gus plants . in d old seedlings gus staining in roots was limited to two rows of cells along the root axis starting about from the root tip corresponding to the elongation zone . gus positive cells were observed in the region between the differentiation zone and the beginning of the hypocotyl . upon closer inspection gus staining was localized to protoxylem . importantly _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ seemed developmentally to precede the appearance of helical secondary cell wall _PROTEIN_ in protoxylem indicating that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ might coincide with the onset of secondary cell wall synthesis . in arabidopsis roots the transition from early to _PROTEIN_ stages of differentiation is characterized by the appearance of metaxylem which is identified on the basis of reticulate rather than helical secondary cell wall _PROTEIN_ . the root xylem of d old arabidopsis seedlings consists of two protoxylem vessels and two or three metaxylem vessels . gus staining in protoxylem and the outer metaxylem vessels usually overlapped but staining in the outer and inner metaxylem was frequently observed to be spatially separated . gus staining appeared in xylem vessels throughout the stem . a weak _PROTEIN_ of gus was also observed in the hypocotyl and petioles as well as in discontinuous parts of the vascular tissue in young rosette leaves . in older leaves gus staining was barely detectable . gus staining was repeatedly seen in vascular tissue at the junction between the hypocotyl and petioles of the most recently developed leaves . no gus staining was observed in the inflorescence siliques or seeds . semi thin sections were made from gus stained _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ gus plants at different stages and counter stained with safranin o to visualize cell structures . as evident from cross sections gus stained cells are located in the primary xylem bundles of young stem sections . the cells have partially _PROTEIN_ secondary cell walls compared with the adjacent mature xylem vessels which is an indication of developing xylem cells that are in the process of producing secondary cell walls . neighbouring cells also showed weak gus staining however this staining probably resulted from leakage of the gus enzyme or the x _PROTEIN_ reaction product from the stained cell . in older mature stem sections gus positive cells were located adjacent to the procambium as expected for developing xylem cells . _PROTEIN_ gus stem cross sections were also counter stained with reagent which stains the free syringyl units of lignin . gus positive cells in young stem sections showed weak or no staining with reagent whereas mature xylem vessels were strongly stained indicating that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ precedes lignin synthesis at this stage . in older stem sections gus positive cells showed variable staining . overall the gus staining pattern suggests that the _PROTEIN_ promoter is active during primary xylem development . _PROTEIN_ gus plants were exposed to a broad array of chemical and physical treatments to see if the _PROTEIN_ promoter region could be induced or repressed . the treatments included exposure to plant hormones _PROTEIN_ oxidative stress osmotic stress _PROTEIN_ elicitors and mechanical wounding . none of these treatments led to a notable increase or _PROTEIN_ in gus staining intensity in _PROTEIN_ gus plants . thus _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ appears to be _PROTEIN_ developmentally regulated . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ close to the root tip of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants was observed in two rows of cells exhibiting a striated pattern due to the presence of secondary cell walls in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cells . z stack analysis of longitudinal optical slices through the root confirmed that the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was restricted to two narrow files . _METHOD_ in all of the optical slices showed the same striated pattern indicative of xylem elements . similar to the results observed for the _PROTEIN_ gus construct _METHOD_ positive cells closest to the root tip did not show any striated pattern suggesting that initial _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ may precede or coincide with secondary cell wall formation in the development of root xylem . the _METHOD_ observed in these less differentiated cells was weak compared with cells with secondary cell walls . in older parts of the root _METHOD_ _METHOD_ appeared in the central part of the root corresponding to the metaxylem . it was not possible to observe any noticeable _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in leaves . next _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion mutant plants _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants and ca _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants were investigated in order to gain functional information on _PROTEIN_ . somewhat surprisingly _PROTEIN_ plants did not display visible phenotypes in overall morphology or in composition and appearance of the vascular tissue . plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ also appeared normal . by contrast leaf elongation was markedly increased in ca _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants . the leaf blades of ca _PROTEIN_ rosette leaves were more oval shaped compared with wild type leaves . the differences in organ elongation might be the result of cell morphology alterations . therefore epidermal cells of rosette leaves were examined using scanning electron microscopy _PROTEIN_ . mature wild type pavement cells positioned towards the tip of rosette leaves are characterized by extended lobes leading to a highly wavy cell outline . by contrast mature pavement cells of ca _PROTEIN_ plants exhibited a more regular cell shape with only a few reduced lobes . in order to quantify this property the ratio of area to perimeter of wild type and mutant leaf pavement cells was measured . pavement cells in ca _PROTEIN_ plants had significantly lower area to perimeter ratios compared with wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants indicating a less lobed cell outline of ca _PROTEIN_ pavement cells . the average cell area of ca _PROTEIN_ pavement cells was only slightly increased compared with wild type pavement cells . the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ was also examined . to do this _METHOD_ fusions of wild type and constitutively activated _PROTEIN_ and generated transgenic plants stably _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ fusion proteins were constructed . both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ ca _PROTEIN_ localized _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of leaf pavement cells . the cell outline was visualized by the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and revealed that _METHOD_ ca _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pavement cells have less extended lobes thereby substantiating the observed phenotype of ca _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants . the changed cell morphology indicates that the _METHOD_ ca _PROTEIN_ fusion protein is functionally active .
