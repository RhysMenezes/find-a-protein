the _LOCATION_ glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase _PROTEIN_ plays an important role in glycolysis by providing the cell with _PROTEIN_ and nadh . interestingly despite its glycolytic function in the _LOCATION_ gapdh was reported to possess additional non glycolytic activities correlating with its _LOCATION_ or cytoskeletal localization in animal cells . in transiently transformed mesophyll protoplasts from arabidopsis thaliana colocalization and interaction of the glycolytic enzymes with the mitochondria and with the actin _LOCATION_ was visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy using _METHOD_ protein fusions and by bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation respectively . yeast two hybrid screens dot blot overlay assays and co sedimentation assays were used to identify potential protein protein interactions between two _LOCATION_ gapdh _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ from a. thaliana with the neighboring glycolytic enzyme fructose bisphosphate aldolase _PROTEIN_ the mitochondrial porin _PROTEIN_ and actin in vitro . from these experiments a mitochondrial association is suggested for both glycolytic enzymes gapdh and aldolase which appear to bind to the outer mitochondrial _LOCATION_ in a redox dependent manner . in addition both glycolytic enzymes were found to bind to f actin in co sedimentation assays and lead to bundling of purified rabbit actin as visualized by clsm . actin binding and bundling occurred reversibly under oxidizing conditions . we speculate that such dynamic formation of microcompartments is part of a redox dependent retrograde signal transduction network for _PROTEIN_ upon oxidative stress .
apart from the even _LOCATION_ distribution and the occasional _LOCATION_ localization of the _METHOD_ fused _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and aldolase reported previously _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals appeared in a non homogeneous distribution as locally accumulated foci of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ of the transformed protoplasts . the _PROTEIN_ containing structures emitted intense _METHOD_ that in many cases was much stronger than the _LOCATION_ distributed _METHOD_ fused enzyme which was frequently observed . the diffuse _LOCATION_ signal was therefore not imaged in certain cases due to down regulation of the detector in the clsm meta _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the _LOCATION_ aggregates of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ seemed to vary with _PROTEIN_ of their size shape and amount . a higher magnification resulted in a better resolution of the foci like spots showing their branched constitution in several cases _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and suggested that these _METHOD_ structures formed by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ could be associated with certain organelles . manifold localization patterns of the gapdh _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusions of the two _METHOD_ of gapdh _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were transiently _PROTEIN_ in the protoplasts isolated from leaves of week old plants of a. thaliana . superimposition of chlorophyll _METHOD_ and locally accumulated _METHOD_ fusions of the two _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ from the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fusions respectively . on the right hand side magnifications are shown of relevant parts . colocalization of _METHOD_ fused _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with mitotracker stained mitochondria . . pictures in the last lane present the magnified areas indicated in the overlays . images in the _METHOD_ and mitotracker channel were taken in the frame mode both channels separately which caused a short time delay between the red and green channel due to respective dichroic mirror settings . protoplasts were transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and tdtomato _PROTEIN_ . the fotos in the panels and show the magnification of the boxed area in foto . all images were taken with the confocal laser scanning microscope lsm meta zeiss . interestingly the presence of and encoded _PROTEIN_ in the secretory pathways was predicted using the _PROTEIN_ database and was reported by santoni et al . and marmagne et al . who both identified _PROTEIN_ in the pm protein fraction from arabidopsis . in addition to pm _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ apparatus constitute the major components of the plant secretory system . in this context the fraction of manifold small _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ foci resembling plant _LOCATION_ apparatus was tested for colocalization with _LOCATION_ stacks using a chimera of the mcherry protein with a transmembrane domain of a rat sialyl transferase . however no colocalization of signals emitted by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ foci and by the _LOCATION_ apparatus could be detected . _PROTEIN_ organelle association was then tested with the mitochondria dye orange . _METHOD_ intensity profiles of the signals emitted by both _METHOD_ fusion _PROTEIN_ and orange enabled a colocalization analysis which indicated that some of the smaller foci of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were associated with mitochondria whereas the bigger branched structures were never close to these organelles . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ can also form cytoplasmic strands when _PROTEIN_ transiently as _METHOD_ fusions that might be correlated with _LOCATION_ . when _METHOD_ fusion of tdtomato with the actin binding domain of fimbrin _PROTEIN_ was applied for staining actin filaments an additional peak for tdtomato that appeared within the _METHOD_ emission range was noticed in protoplasts that were transiently _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . therefore the analysis of cytoskeletal association of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ had to be modified . during microscopic imaging with clsm meta it turned out that by down regulation of the detector the bleeding through artifacts could be removed allowing visualization of the stronger _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ foci only with respect to the stained actin _LOCATION_ . this approach enabled the observation of the punctuate signals emitted by _METHOD_ fusion _PROTEIN_ and showed that the clusters might move between actin fibrils but their direct association with stained actin filaments was not obvious . time lapse images of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ aggregates with respect to the actin _LOCATION_ . time lapse images of the gapdh aggregates in relation to the actin _LOCATION_ show _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ aggregates moving along actin fibers . images were taken after the indicated times . actin filaments are stained with tdtomato _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ foci are displayed in green . scale bar . the images were taken with the confocal laser scanning microscope lsm meta zeiss . identification of new interaction partners of _PROTEIN_ by a yeast two hybrid screen of a cdna library could elucidate its variable subcellular localization and novel moonlighting features which have been suggested for the animal counterpart . such approach might also help to reveal why this _LOCATION_ enzyme can localize to different subcellular structures such as _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ or possibly with the omm which has been recently observed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and what we follow in this study . here a yeast two hybrid screen of the cdna library from a. thaliana was performed . among putative interaction partners of the _PROTEIN_ four cdna coding for the voltage dependent anion channel _PROTEIN_ a porin from the omm and _PROTEIN_ clones could be identified . the presence of yeast colonies _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ protein on sd/qdo/x gal is a hint to suggest positive but weaker interactions between subunits of different _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which form not only homo but also heterooligomers . a yeast two hybrid screen with _PROTEIN_ as bait protein revealed protein protein interaction partners of this isoform . among them sequences were full length clones encoding _PROTEIN_ . both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were applied in an additional set of one on one yeast two hybrid assays in order to retest the specificity of these associations . the colonies containing hybrid _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fused with the bd domain and _PROTEIN_ fused with the ad domain grew under high stringency conditions confirming the positive interaction found in the yeast two hybrid screen . with help of control vectors it was surprisingly shown that autoactivation of all reporter genes took place in the case of _PROTEIN_ ad _PROTEIN_ cotransfected with an empty vector or lamc . the appropriate yeast colonies grew on sd/tdo and additionally on sd/qdo/x gal . this unspecific autoactivation of reporter genes seemed to be a property of _PROTEIN_ ad which was not the case for the _PROTEIN_ bd _PROTEIN_ from under a truncated _PROTEIN_ promoter . however it also did not interact with any of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the initially identified _PROTEIN_ ad and _PROTEIN_ bd interaction could therefore not be confirmed due to the autoactivating property of _PROTEIN_ ad . excluding the effect of autoactivation by only using _PROTEIN_ as a bait the interaction with aldolase was also tested . surprisingly only a weak interaction of aldolase with itself when forming an homooligomer was found . its interactions with _PROTEIN_ and or with _PROTEIN_ were negative in this assay . yeast hybrid one on one assays between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ aldolase and _PROTEIN_ . putatively positive interactions had been identified in the yeast two hybrid screen of the cdna library from a. thaliana . here to retest these findings the haploid yeast strain was cotransformed with constructs _PROTEIN_ bait or prey proteins as indicated in the table . serial dilution of the appropriate overnight yeast culture was dropped onto selective media to demonstrate the stringency of binding between proteins . colonies growing on were successfully transformed with both vectors encoding the investigated proteins . growth on sd/tdo and sd/qdo/x gal is a sign of positive interactions . italics indicate false positive results due to autoactivation by _PROTEIN_ when used as a prey . split _METHOD_ fusions of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts with the aim to verify their putatively direct interaction in planta which was found in the yeast two hybrid screen but appeared to be false positive in the one on one assay . in both combinations of _METHOD_ fusions _METHOD_ signals could be detected in protoplasts . some of the _METHOD_ foci were colocalized with mitochondria but other observed signals reflecting interaction between _PROTEIN_ and porin did not overlap with the organelles stained with orange which was also the case for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . colocalization of aldolase _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with mitochondria . vectors encoding the investigated proteins were cotransformed in protoplasts isolated from leaves of a. thaliana plants . the _METHOD_ signals from _PROTEIN_ interacting with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as well as _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ fused with n or c terminal halves of _METHOD_ respectively were tested for mitochondrial localization by staining the cells with nm orange cmtmros . previous screening of the cdna library from hypoxic seedlings of zea mays as well as a dot blot overlay assay had demonstrated binding of the _LOCATION_ isoform of maize fructose bisphosphate aldolase to the mitochondrial porin _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . it was therefore tempting to look also at this interaction in vivo in arabidopsis protoplasts that enabled the _PROTEIN_ of aldolase fused to the n terminal _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ fused to the c terminal half of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . indeed _METHOD_ signals occurred in a locally accumulated form . additional staining of mitochondria confirmed the location of the _METHOD_ foci next to these organelles . no signals were observed however when vectors encoding aldolase fused to the c terminal _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ fused to the n terminal half of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were used . therefore sterical _PROTEIN_ may determine whether the direct binding of aldolase to _PROTEIN_ can occur . this localization pattern was not detected in the negative controls . when an empty puc _PROTEIN_ vector and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ fused to the c terminal halves of the _METHOD_ were used positive bifc signals that were homogeneously distributed in the cytoplasm or even localized in the _LOCATION_ were surprisingly found in several protoplasts . an identical _LOCATION_ localization pattern was observed also in the arabidopsis protoplasts _PROTEIN_ split _METHOD_ fused _PROTEIN_ and/or _PROTEIN_ reflecting the homo and heterooligomerization of its subunits respectively . beside this _LOCATION_ compartmentation _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interacted also in a locally accumulated way in some cases close to the stained mitochondria which correlated with the microscopic observations _PROTEIN_ potential mitochondrial association of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . with respect to the negative controls that were false positive the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ like _METHOD_ signals are not easily distinguishable from the false positive interaction . these putatively positive results may be unspecific and the homogeneous distribution of interacting glycolytic enzymes could be artifactual . the irreversible nature of the association between the two _METHOD_ fragments especially when they are overexpressed or documented after a longer period of the transient _PROTEIN_ namely over h may be the reason for the false positive signals . from the above described experimental approaches that are frequently used to study protein protein interactions no uniform picture could be drawn as to the in vivo binding of soluble glycolytic enzymes to cellular structures . this is probably due to the _PROTEIN_ that the cellular state and the actual microenvironment of the interacting partners can not easily be controlled . unknown cellular _PROTEIN_ such as posttranslational modifications another protein required for this interaction or a redox signal coming from the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ or from the chloroplasts could play a crucial role for all observations made in in vivo _METHOD_ such as isolated protoplasts or in yeast cells where the tested interactions take place in the _LOCATION_ . in order to study the redox dependence of the observed interactions under defined conditions various in vitro assays were performed with the purified recombinant proteins . incubation of f actin with recombinant plant aldolase and _PROTEIN_ under reducing conditions and subsequent centrifugation resulted in a pellet fraction containing only actin and no glycolytic enzymes as can be seen from the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ analysis after ultracentrifugation . in contrast incubation under various different oxidizing conditions resulted in the appearance of a certain portion of _PROTEIN_ and/or aldolase in the pellet fractions diamide and gssg treatment yielding _PROTEIN_ aldolase in the pellet while gsno resulted in _PROTEIN_ associating with f actin . subsequent reduction of an aliquot reversed the binding completely . both aldolase and _PROTEIN_ were also added separately to the f actin preparation yielding the same results as were obtained with both enzymes present simultaneously . co sedimentation assay with f actin gapdh and aldolase under oxidizing and reducing conditions . samples with rabbit f actin _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were first oxidized with the specific redox reagents diamide gsh gssg gsh gsno with a following reduction by dttred . the control sample with f actin _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was only incubated with dttred . the mixtures were then centrifugated at g for h. supernatant and pellet were separated for analysis by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the gels were stained with _METHOD_ brilliant blue . bundle like structures formed by stained rabbit f actin were detected only under oxidizing conditions in the simultaneous presence of the glycolytic enzymes or of each of the enzymes alone . the bundle structures disappeared when the sample was reduced subsequently with dtt . when the enzymes were added in the presence of dtt the same picture was apparent as with subsequent reduction of the previously oxidized sample . in case when only dtt was present without any enzymes added there was no formation of bundles visible either . in a control experiment no glycolytic enzyme but bsa was present instead both under oxidizing and subsequent reducing conditions and no bundle structures were visible under both conditions . although in these experiments it is not possible to detect any bound proteins the bundling activity of the glycolytic enzymes became apparent due to the changed appearance of the actin structure as visualized by microscopy . taken together these experiments indicate that the glycolytic enzymes might act as bundling agents but in a reversible manner only under oxidizing conditions . effect of redox state on f actin bundling activity of _PROTEIN_ and aldolase . samples with rabbit f actin aldolase and _PROTEIN_ were first oxidized with the specific redox reagents diamide gsh gssg gsh gsno followed by a reduction step with dttred . subsequently the samples were stained with rhodamine labeled phalloidin and _METHOD_ was visualized by clsm . the control experiment represents an incubation of f actin with bsa incubated with diamide gsh and the subsequent reduction with dtt . scale bar . redox dependent binding of aldolase to f actin g actin and _PROTEIN_ under oxidizing conditions as observed in the co sedimentation assays was confirmed by the dot blot overlay assay . under all oxidizing conditions a positive reaction was observed except with bsa that was used as a negative control . in the final immunodecoration any aldolase that had bound to a spotted protein could be detected . glutathionylation as well as nitrosylation resulted in binding of aldolase to f actin but also to _PROTEIN_ with a similar affinity . the interaction between g actin and the modified _PROTEIN_ was much weaker than with the filamentous protein . reduction prevented any binding of the added aldolase only the formation of a homomeric oligomer of aldolase took place also under reducing conditions as apparent after immunostaining . analysis redox dependent binding of aldolase to gapdh actin and _PROTEIN_ by far western blotting . aldolase _PROTEIN_ gapdh _PROTEIN_ g actin rabbit f actin and bovine serum albumin as negative control were applied onto a nitrocellulose _LOCATION_ overlaid with aldolase in the presence of mm dtt mm gsno mm gssg mm diamide plus mm gsh or mm plus mm gsh and probed with polyclonal antibody against maize aldolase as described in section . _PROTEIN_ reconstituted into liposomes was applied onto a nitrocellulose _LOCATION_ overlaid with aldolase in the presence of mm dtt and without reductant . empty liposomes and _PROTEIN_ were used as controls immunological detection of bound aldolase was as in . . _PROTEIN_ and bsa as a control were applied to the _LOCATION_ which was overlaid with _PROTEIN_ in liposomes . detection was with anti _PROTEIN_ serum and the hrp conjugated second antiserum using ecl as a substrate as described in section . the regulation of the direct binding of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ found in protoplasts was verified by means of a dot blot overlay approach . under oxidizing conditions the binding of aldolase to _PROTEIN_ could be detected by immunodecoration with antibody against aldolase . similarly a positive signal was also observed when oxidized _PROTEIN_ was overlaid with _PROTEIN_ and immunodecorated with anti vdac antibody . these positive reactions were not observed with the empty liposomes and _PROTEIN_ or with bsa which were used as negative controls in this assay . reduction prevented any binding of the glycolytic enzymes to the porin . there is evidence from earlier work on the animal model that actin binding sites contain amino acid motifs with clustered charged residues namely asp and glu as well as lys and arg _PROTEIN_ . it is obvious from the comparison with the animal counterparts that the positions of the positively and negatively charged residues on the surface of the proteins which are implicated to be involved in the binding are rather conserved as are these proteins altogether . from the side view that is depicted to demonstrate the relative positions of these charged residues it is not possible to locate surface cys residues that have been shown to be subject to redox modifications . however it can be imagined that even distant molecular changes upon redox modification of these residues can allosterically affect the binding sites by changing the charge distribution in the critical surface area . homology modeling of structures of aldolase gapdh and actin . on the left hand side the proteins from rabbit as used by forlemu et al . _PROTEIN_ are shown . the corresponding arabidopsis proteins on the right hand side were modeled with swiss model as described in section . by using the swiss pdb viewer the molecular surface of the generated protein models was calculated and the conserved amino acids which are necessary for the protein protein interaction are colored positively charged amino acids are blue negatively charged amino acids are red . cysteines are shown in yellow .
mesophyll protoplasts isolated from of a. thaliana plants were used for in vivo labeling of the subcellular structures and organelles such as _LOCATION_ apparatus _LOCATION_ actin _LOCATION_ and mitochondria as well as visualization of subcellular localization of proteins fused to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ . protoplasts were isolated from leaves of to week old wild type a. thaliana plants according to seidel et al . with some modifications _PROTEIN_ . the glycolytic enzymes were _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts from the _METHOD_ vector as a c terminal fusion with the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ under control of the constitutive camv promoter . similar experiments were carried out with vectors encoding _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ as _METHOD_ fusions based on the p _METHOD_ nost vector which was kindly provided by thorsten seidel . a chimera of the mcherry protein with a transmembrane domain of a rat sialyl transferase which is a mammalian _LOCATION_ targeted glycosylation enzyme was used in order to visualize _LOCATION_ apparatus in the plant cell . this construct was obtained from ekkehard neuhaus . visualization of actin microfilaments in plant cells was performed using a vector encoding tdtomato _PROTEIN_ kindly provided by takumi higaki . it consists of the second actin binding domain of the fimbrin like protein from a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ fused with tdtomato . plant mitochondria were visualized by staining mesophyll protoplasts with the orange cmtmros . the protein protein interactions between the glycolytic enzymes _PROTEIN_ and aldolase with _PROTEIN_ were investigated by means of the bifc technique _METHOD_ . appropriate vectors puc _PROTEIN_ and puc _PROTEIN_ obtained from prof. kudla were used to design constructs _PROTEIN_ the respective proteins . fusions of aldolase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with the n terminal or the c terminal half of the _METHOD_ are described as x _METHOD_ or x _METHOD_ respectively . combination of plasmids puc _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and puc _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ coding for an _METHOD_ fusion with the transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was used as a positive control in the bifc assay . homodimerization of this protein was already demonstrated to occur in the plant _LOCATION_ . the transiently transformed protoplasts incubated between and h were stained with nm orange cmtmros for min at rt in the dark prior to imaging . afterwards the sample was centrifuged for min at g and the resulting pellet was resuspended with ml solution . the plant cells were immediately observed using the clsm meta . _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ of chlorophyll were visualized with excitation at nm and emission at and nm respectively . _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ of chlorophyll were visualized with excitation at nm and emission at nm and nm respectively . _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ of chlorophyll were visualized with excitation at nm and emission at nm and nm respectively . when observed with stained mitochondria _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ of chlorophyll were visualized with excitation at nm and emission at nm and nm respectively whereas orange was excited with nm and emitted at nm . the same settings were used for the combination with _METHOD_ when actin _LOCATION_ was additionally visualized . in case when _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts along with stained mitochondria _METHOD_ was visualized with excitation at nm and emission at nm whereas orange was excited with nm and emitted at nm both detected with meta detector respectively . the two _METHOD_ of gapdh from a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were applied as baits in the two hybrid screen of the cdna library for positive protein protein interactions according to kolonin et al . with small modifications . the cdna library from a. thaliana suspension cell culture was obtained from prof. koncz university of bonn . screens were performed according to manufacturer s instructions . as further confirmation of the interactions found in the dna library screen the putatively positive interactions were tested in a one on one assay . for this aim the haploid strain provides all needed reporter genes _PROTEIN_ so that it could be cotransformed with both vectors encoding the investigated bait and prey proteins . the positively transformed yeast colonies with two replicates in each case were tested for activation of the reporter genes _PROTEIN_ by drop test on selective media lacking tryptophane leucine and histidine . for strong protein protein interaction medium was additionally lacking adenine . in case of control experiments yeast cells were transformed with a combination of the investigated partner and empty bait or prey vector . since plant and animal actin are highly conserved in sequence co sedimentation experiments were performed with commercially available rabbit muscle actin that was _PROTEIN_ from _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . actin was purified by a polymerization/depolymerization cycle prior to usage . in order to exclude the possibility to capture soluble enzymes during polymerization without specific binding the polymerization step was performed prior to the addition of the soluble enzymes . g actin was prepared in low salt buffer _PROTEIN_ by incubation of rabbit muscle actin for min on ice buffer change over pierce desalting spin columns and ultracentrifugation at g for h at . g actin was polymerized upon addition of polymerization inducer _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ at a protein concentration of mg/ml in lsb . aldolase _PROTEIN_ gapdh _PROTEIN_ and bsa were also adjusted to a protein concentration of mg/ml with assay buffer _PROTEIN_ . f actin and the glycolytic protein/s were mixed with a ratio on a protein basis and redox reagents were added . the mixtures were incubated at for min . then dttred was added to one part of the mixtures followed by incubation for min at . then supernatant and pellet were separated by ultracentrifugation at g for h at . both fractions were analyzed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and subsequent staining of the gels with _METHOD_ brilliant blue r. samples of f actin together with _PROTEIN_

tetramethylrhodamine b isothiocyanate . _METHOD_ was visualized by clsm using the plan apochromat oil dic objective . picture calculation and processing were done with the lsm image browser . overlay dot blot analyses were performed with recombinant gapdh _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ reconstituted into liposomes purified f actin g actin and bsa as a negative control . in the case of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and empty liposomes were used as negative controls . the proteins were dripped onto nitrocellulose _LOCATION_ and air dried . the _LOCATION_ were blocked with bsa in tbs t for h and washed . _LOCATION_

respectively for h at room temperature and finally washed . for cross linking the _LOCATION_ were treated with glutaraldehyde in mm hepes buffer for min at and washed . immunodetection was achieved with polyclonal antibody against maize aldolase or against _PROTEIN_ for h at room temperature and color development using goat anti rabbit igg conjugated with alkaline phosphatase using bcip/nbt as substrates or the second antiserum conjugated with horseradish peroxidase using ecl as substrate . for the dot blot analyses _PROTEIN_ was synthesized in a cell free system and separated from the reaction mix via reconstitution into liposomes in the presence of mm nonanoyl n methylglucamide . the reconstitution of _PROTEIN_ into liposomes was verified by a density gradient flotation assay of the proteoliposomes . the dot blot assay was performed as described above in the presence and the absence of mm dtt . the three dimensional structures of the proteins were generated using the homology modeling mode of the swiss model workspace . the template structures for the homology modeling of the a. thaliana proteins were selected in accordance with the protein structures which were used by forlemu et al . _PROTEIN_ . for the comparison of the amino acids which were identified by forlemu et al . _PROTEIN_ and ouporov et al . to be involved in the ionic interaction a multiple sequence alignment was performed .
