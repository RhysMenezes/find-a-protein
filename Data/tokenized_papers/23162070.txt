the plant nadph oxidases known as respiratory burst oxidase homologues play an indispensable role in a wide array of cellular and developmental processes . arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mediated production of reactive oxygen species is involved in biotic and abiotic stress responses . because of the toxicity of excess amount of ros the ros producing activity of rbohs is speculated to be negatively regulated . however its mechanism is mostly unknown to date . here we report the identification of calcineurin b like protein interacting protein kinase _PROTEIN_ as a novel regulatory _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . we isolated _PROTEIN_ as an _PROTEIN_ interacting partner by a yeast two hybrid screen . our co immunoprecipitation assay revealed that the _PROTEIN_ protein interacts with the n terminal region of _PROTEIN_ in nicotiana benthamiana cell extracts . the _METHOD_ of both _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was predominantly observed at the cell periphery . we also showed that co _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the ros producing activity of _PROTEIN_ in cells . together these results suggest that the direct binding of _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ negatively modulates ros production and play a role in the regulation of ros signalling in plants .
we performed a yeast two hybrid screen to identify _PROTEIN_ interacting proteins from the arabidopsis cdna library . we used the n terminal region of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as a bait because this region which contains two ef hand motifs is known to play a key role in the regulation of the rboh activity . the full length _PROTEIN_ was not suitable for this yeast two hybrid system because it possesses multiple tm helices . screening of yeast transformants resulted in isolation of a fragment containing the naf and protein phosphatase interaction _PROTEIN_ motifs of _PROTEIN_ . the naf domain is unique to regulated kinases and responsible for the _PROTEIN_ cipk interaction . _PROTEIN_ domain mediates interaction with type protein phosphatase type phosphatase . cells co _PROTEIN_ both the full length _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were able to grow in the absence of histidine indicating that _PROTEIN_ interacted with the n terminal region of _PROTEIN_ in yeast cells . to examine whether _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ in vivo we performed co ip experiments . the n terminal _PROTEIN_ tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the n terminal myc tagged full length _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were transiently co _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana leaves by agroinfiltration . the cell extracts from leaves were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies and the immunocomplexes were analysed by western blotting with anti myc antibodies . as shown in fig . myc _PROTEIN_ was co immunoprecipitated with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ interacts with the n terminal region of _PROTEIN_ in vivo . this observation suggests that _PROTEIN_ could be localized around _PROTEIN_ in plant cells . to test this idea we transiently _PROTEIN_ the n terminal _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in onion epidermal cells by biolistic bombardment . _PROTEIN_ has been biochemically shown as an intrinsic _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein that possesses six tm helices . consistently the _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was observed at the cell periphery supporting that _PROTEIN_ is localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was also predominantly observed at the cell periphery suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ distributed at the cell periphery in the vicinity of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or in the _LOCATION_ . in contrast free _METHOD_ was distributed throughout the _LOCATION_ including the cytoplasmic strands and the _LOCATION_ . these results support the idea that some of _PROTEIN_ could be associated with _PROTEIN_ at the cell periphery . we next asked whether _PROTEIN_ modulates the ros producing activity of _PROTEIN_ . to this end _PROTEIN_ tagged full length _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was co transfected with either myc _PROTEIN_ or myc _METHOD_ into cells and the _PROTEIN_ mediated ros production was measured by a luminol amplified chemiluminescence technique . as _PROTEIN_ is known to be activated by we added to the co transfected cells ionomycin a ionophore that induces influx into cells . ionomycin induced _PROTEIN_ activation resulted in a transient and rapid production of ros in the cells co _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and myc _METHOD_ but not in the cells carrying the empty vector control . interestingly this _PROTEIN_ mediated ros production was reduced in the cells co _PROTEIN_ myc _PROTEIN_ than the cells co _PROTEIN_ myc _METHOD_ . the observed reduction of ros levels is not due to a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein level in the myc _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells . indeed our western blot analysis showed that co _PROTEIN_ of myc _PROTEIN_ did not significantly affect the _PROTEIN_ protein level . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ represses the ros producing activity of _PROTEIN_ in cells . _PROTEIN_ is activated by its phosphorylation and . however it had been unclear how the activity of _PROTEIN_ is negatively regulated in plant cells . in this study we elucidated that _PROTEIN_ a putative protein kinase interacts with _PROTEIN_ and represses the ros producing activity of _PROTEIN_ . we propose two _METHOD_ by which _PROTEIN_ represses the activity of _PROTEIN_ . in the first model binding of _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ may inhibit a proper conformational change of the n terminal region of _PROTEIN_ . it has been suggested that a induced conformational change of the ef hand region of _PROTEIN_ is critical for its ros producing activity . a similar conformational change in _PROTEIN_ may be blocked by the direct interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ . another possibility is that a _PROTEIN_ mediated phosphorylation of specific residues in _PROTEIN_ represses its ros producing activity . the yeast abc transporter is positively regulated by phosphorylation on its abc core domain while it is negatively regulated by phosphorylation on the n terminal extension . _PROTEIN_ has been reported to possess multiple phosphorylation sites . in addition the netphos server predicted at least ser/thr residues as potential phosphorylation sites in _PROTEIN_ . thus the activity of _PROTEIN_ may be positively or negatively regulated depending on which target sites are phosphorylated by the associated kinase . in any case we have shown that _PROTEIN_ directly binds _PROTEIN_ to negatively modulate its ros producing activity . this interaction may play a role in the regulation of ros signalling in plants . the protein kinase activities of cipks are regulated by _PROTEIN_ . future analyses on the interrelationship among cipks _PROTEIN_ and rbohs should further reveal how the ros producing activity of rboh proteins is regulated positively and negatively .
