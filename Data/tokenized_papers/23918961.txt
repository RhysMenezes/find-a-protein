proteins are a family of type i _LOCATION_ proteins localized to compartments of the early secretory pathway and to coat protein i _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ coated vesicles . they can be classified by sequence homology into four subfamilies named and . in contrast to animals and fungi plants contain only members of the and subfamilies the latter probably including two different subclasses . it has previously been shown that transiently _PROTEIN_ red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ localizes to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ at steady state as a consequence of highly efficient _PROTEIN_ based recycling from the _LOCATION_ apparatus . it is now shown that transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ also localizes to the _LOCATION_ . in contrast transiently _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localizes to the _LOCATION_ apparatus and exits the _LOCATION_ in a _PROTEIN_ dependent manner . immunogold electron microscopy in arabidopsis root tip cells using specific antibodies shows that endogenous localizes _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ but also partially to the cis _LOCATION_ . in contrast endogenous _PROTEIN_ localizes to the _LOCATION_ apparatus . by a combination of experiments using transient _PROTEIN_ knock out mutants and co immunoprecipitation it is proposed that arabidopsis proteins form different heteromeric complexes which are important for their stability and their coupled trafficking at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ interface . evidence is also provided for a role for in retrograde _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ transport of the kdel receptor _LOCATION_ .
the localization of endogenous and and in arabidopsis root cells was previously shown . the localization of in a branch of the subfamily different from that of or and of the second member of the subfamily in arabidopsis has now been investigated . to this end peptide antibodies were generated against the n terminus of both proteins which in contrast to the c terminus shows a high variability among different proteins . proteins were extracted from _LOCATION_ of arabidopsis cell suspension cultures or from arabidopsis roots . as shown in antibodies against the n terminus of recognized a protein of the expected molecular weight in both _LOCATION_ extracts while antibodies against the n terminus of recognized a protein with an apparent molecular weight of . interestingly and showed a slightly different electrophoretic mobility which in addition was also different from that of and . these differences in electrophoretic mobility were also obvious when the luminal n terminal portion of both and with a c terminal tag was _PROTEIN_ in bacteria . bacterial extracts were used to characterize further the specificity of the antibodies . as shown in supplementary fig . antibodies against the n terminus of did not recognize the n terminus of while antibodies against the n terminus of did not recognize the n terminus of . these antibodies were used to localize and by immunogold labelling on sections cut from cryofixed arabidopsis roots . as shown in the n terminal antibody _PROTEIN_ labelled _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as was found previously for endogenous and . occasionally some labelling was also seen on the cis _LOCATION_ . in contrast the n terminal antibody _PROTEIN_ labelled the _LOCATION_ apparatus although some labelling could also be seen at _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . this localization is very similar to that previously shown for endogenous . characterization of antibodies against arabidopsis proteins . protein extracts were obtained from _LOCATION_ of arabidopsis cell suspension cultures or arabidopsis roots as described in the materials and methods and analysed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and western blotting with antibodies against the n terminus and n terminus or with the corresponding pre immune sera . western blotting with antibodies against and is also shown . note the slightly different electrophoretic mobility of and . localization of and by immunogold

point to gold particles . _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ g _LOCATION_ apparatus mvb multivesicular body . it was previously demonstrated that transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localizes to the _LOCATION_ at steady state but cycles between the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . arabidopsis proteins of the delta subfamily have been suggested to belong to two different subclasses and with different localization and trafficking properties . in particular members of the subclass localized exclusively to the _LOCATION_ while members of the subclass localized to both the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ when transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaf epidermal cells . therefore the trafficking properties of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were compared . in marked contrast to the data of it was found that transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localizes exclusively to the _LOCATION_ both in tobacco protoplasts and in tobacco leaf epidermal cells . in both cases _METHOD_ co localized extensively with the _LOCATION_ markers _METHOD_ hdel but not with the _LOCATION_ markers mani _METHOD_ . at low _PROTEIN_ levels it showed a pattern nearly indistinguishable from that of _METHOD_ . at higher _PROTEIN_ levels it partially localized to dots or even to _PROTEIN_ like structures probably artefacts of overexpression . however none of these structures was found to co localize with the _LOCATION_ markers mani _METHOD_ . therefore transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ to localize exclusively to the _LOCATION_ like _METHOD_ . localization of _METHOD_ . transient gene _PROTEIN_ in tobacco mesophyll protoplasts . _METHOD_ co localizes extensively with the _LOCATION_ marker _METHOD_ hdel . _METHOD_ does not co localize with the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ does not co localize with the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ upon _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . transient gene _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaf epidermal cells . _METHOD_ co localizes extensively with the _LOCATION_ marker _METHOD_ hdel . _METHOD_ does not co localize with the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . scale bars . in order to investigate if transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ also cycles between the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ as does _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was co _PROTEIN_ with the _PROTEIN_ restricted _PROTEIN_ mutant which prevents _PROTEIN_ mediated _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ recycling . this treatment has been shown to redistribute _METHOD_ partially to the _LOCATION_ apparatus . interestingly this treatment did not change the _LOCATION_ localization of _METHOD_ . the trafficking properties of _METHOD_ were also investigated . similar to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ showed a punctate pattern which partially co localized with the _LOCATION_ markers _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ or mani _METHOD_ . when co _PROTEIN_ with the gdp restricted _PROTEIN_ mutant which causes relocalization of _LOCATION_ markers to the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ completely redistributed to the _LOCATION_ where it co localized with both _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ and man i _METHOD_ . this was also the case for _METHOD_ . these data suggest that transiently _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ localize to the _LOCATION_ apparatus as had been observed for the endogenous proteins . when _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ was co _PROTEIN_ with to inhibit _PROTEIN_ dependent _LOCATION_ export both proteins were _PROTEIN_ localized to the _LOCATION_ together with the _LOCATION_ marker man i _METHOD_ . this suggests that both proteins exit the _LOCATION_ in a _PROTEIN_ dependent manner . in contrast to _METHOD_ co _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ and not only led to a complete reticular pattern but some dots were also very obvious . to test for the identity of these dots _METHOD_ and were co _PROTEIN_ with vp _METHOD_ a _PROTEIN_ marker . as shown in many of the _METHOD_ punctae co localized with vp _METHOD_ suggesting that at least a fraction of _METHOD_ may accumulate at _LOCATION_ under these conditions . localization of _METHOD_ . transient gene _PROTEIN_

upon co _PROTEIN_ with the _PROTEIN_ gdp mutant . scale bars . _LOCATION_ export of proteins of the beta subfamily is _PROTEIN_ dependent . transient gene _PROTEIN_ in tobacco mesophyll protoplasts . _METHOD_ co localizes with mani _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ upon overexpression . _METHOD_ co localizes with mani _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ upon overexpression but also in punctate structures . _METHOD_ co localizes partially with the _PROTEIN_ marker vp _METHOD_ in punctate structures upon overexpression . scale bars . as had been observed with _METHOD_ the signal obtained for _METHOD_ in the _PROTEIN_ when _PROTEIN_ alone was relatively low . when the levels of _METHOD_ were analysed by western blotting a relatively low signal was also detected . the stability of proteins depends on their interactions with other family members . therefore transiently _PROTEIN_ individual proteins may be more susceptible to protein degradation . to investigate the _METHOD_ involved in the degradation of and both proteins were _PROTEIN_ in the presence of mg a proteasome inhibitor or e an inhibitor of cysteine proteinases . western blot analysis shows that the levels of both and significantly increased in the presence of e but not in the presence of mg suggesting that both proteins are _PROTEIN_ degraded by cysteine proteinases in acidic compartments . stability of proteins of the beta subfamily . tobacco mesophyll protoplasts were electroporated in the absence or the presence of of plasmid dnas corresponding to _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ in the absence or the presence of mg or e . at post electroporation protoplasts were washed and homogenized to obtain a post _LOCATION_ supernatant which was then centrifuged to obtain a total _LOCATION_ fraction . _LOCATION_ were extracted in laemmli sample buffer and analysed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and western blot analysis with antibodies against ct or _METHOD_ . a aliquot of protein was loaded for each of the extracts . western blotting with an antibody against the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ was used as a loading control . proteins are thought to form hetero oligomeric complexes via their coiled coil domains which are essential for their trafficking and localization . it has been previously shown that and interact with each other probably at _LOCATION_ for their coupled transport to the _LOCATION_ apparatus . this analysis has now been extended to other members of the and subfamilies . as shown in when _METHOD_ was co _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ the signal of _METHOD_ was clearly more intense than when _PROTEIN_ alone but still localized to punctae . in addition it was observed that _METHOD_ showed its typical _LOCATION_ pattern but also localized to the same punctae under these conditions . the punctae where both proteins co localize overlapped extensively with the _LOCATION_ marker _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ but also with the _PROTEIN_ marker vp _METHOD_ . this suggests that _METHOD_ is able to enhance the _LOCATION_ exit of _METHOD_ and its transport to the _LOCATION_ apparatus as happens with _METHOD_ . this was also the case when _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were transiently co _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaf epidermal cells while _METHOD_ localized exclusively to the _LOCATION_ when _PROTEIN_ individually it also localized to punctae when co _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ . under these conditions the punctae containing _METHOD_ showed an almost complete co localization with _METHOD_ . whether _METHOD_ showed the same trafficking characteristics as _METHOD_ was next investigated in co _PROTEIN_ experiments . as shown in _METHOD_ punctae showed only a partial co localization with either _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ . strikingly _METHOD_ did not significantly change the _LOCATION_ localization of _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ in contrast to _METHOD_ . co localization of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ in co _PROTEIN_ experiments in a measurements were made on separate cells upon double co _PROTEIN_ and calculated with imagej and the plugins jacop _METHOD_ and psc colocalization . in b measurements were made on separate cells upon quadruple co _PROTEIN_ out of four independent experiments and calculated with imagej and the plugin colocalizergb . co _PROTEIN_ of proteins of the beta and delta subfamilies . transient gene _PROTEIN_ in tobacco mesophyll protoplasts . _METHOD_ co localizes

_PROTEIN_ with either _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . in both cases there was a partial co localization of the three proteins in punctate structures . when _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were _PROTEIN_ together _PROTEIN_ various degrees of co localization between these proteins were obtained . however the most striking observation was that _METHOD_ remained mostly punctate while in most of the protoplasts _METHOD_ was clearly less punctate and much more reticular . under these conditions _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was mostly reticular . finally the two proteins _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were co _PROTEIN_ with either _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ . under these conditions _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ extensively co localized in punctate structures . in contrast _METHOD_ was only partially punctate and significantly redistributed to the _LOCATION_ where it partially co localized with _METHOD_ . co _PROTEIN_ of proteins of the beta and delta subfamilies . transient gene _PROTEIN_ in tobacco mesophyll protoplasts . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ co localize partially in punctate structures . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ co localize partially in punctate structures . co _PROTEIN_

might depend on their trafficking properties protoplasts were analysed by western blotting following the co _PROTEIN_ experiments shown above . since the n terminal antibodies could not detect transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ by western blotting _METHOD_ antibodies which recognized both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were used instead . the results are summarized in . as has been shown previously the levels of _METHOD_ increased significantly upon co _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ . it has now been found that the levels of _METHOD_ also increased significantly when co _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ . on the other hand the levels of _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ were not significantly increased when both proteins were _PROTEIN_ together . in the case of _METHOD_ its levels increased upon co _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ but increased much more in the quadruple co _PROTEIN_ . levels of and in co _PROTEIN_ experiments quantification of western blots from two different co _PROTEIN_ experiments like the one shown in using the quantity one software . the amount of was calculated as the difference between the intensity of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and that of . western blots in the linear range of detection that showed comparable intensities for and _METHOD_ in the co _PROTEIN_ of and were selected . biochemical analysis of co _PROTEIN_ experiments . tobacco mesophyll protoplasts were electroporated in the absence or the presence of of the indicated plasmid dnas . at post electroporation protoplasts were washed and homogenized to obtain a post _LOCATION_ supernatant which was then centrifuged to obtain a total _LOCATION_ fraction . _LOCATION_ were extracted in laemmli sample buffer and analysed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and western blot analysis with antibodies against _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ the c terminus or _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . a aliquot of protein was loaded for each of the extracts . western blot with an antibody against the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ was used as a loading control . previous studies where a single member of the family had been deleted or knocked down showed that the protein level of other family members was reduced which probably reflects the _PROTEIN_ that these proteins interact with each other in hetero oligomeric complexes . therefore the protein levels of or were examined in knock out/knock down mutants . t dna insertion knock out mutants lacking and had already been characterized . as no t dna insertion knock out mutant for was found in the salk collection a knock out mutant for was analysed . plants from the three lines resembled wild type plants under standard growth conditions . as t dna insertion mutants for or are not available in mutant collections amirna was used to knock down or . no distinct phenotype was observed in amir or amir knock down lines when compared with wild type plants under standard growth conditions . protein extracts from roots of wild type plants t dna knock out insertion mutants and amir and amir lines were analysed by western blotting with the corresponding antibodies . it was previously shown that the t dna mutant lacking showed levels comparable with those of the wild type . the same was true for the levels of in the mutant . however both mutants showed reduced levels of and . in contrast the t dna mutant lacking did not show reduced protein levels of or but showed a fold increase in the protein levels of the highly related . finally the lines _PROTEIN_ amirnas were analysed for or . _PROTEIN_ of and was reduced by in the amir and amir lines respectively . in addition the amir line showed reduced protein levels of and while the amir line showed reduced protein levels of and . these results suggest that proteins do interact with other family members to form heteromeric complexes . levels of proteins in knock out mutants or amirna lines . western blot analysis with antibodies against the n terminus of or or the c terminus of in _LOCATION_ from the wild

lane . western blotting with an antibody against the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ was used as a loading control . lower panel shows a quantification of the levels of each of the proteins in each mutant calculated as a percentage of the levels present in wild type _LOCATION_ . to test biochemically for interactions between endogenous proteins co immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using c terminal or antibodies . as shown in antibodies against the c terminus of caused the co immunoprecipitation of and while antibodies against the c terminus of caused the co immunoprecipitation of and . as a control control beads or n terminal antibodies which have previously beeen shown to be unable to immunoprecipitate were used . pull down experiments were also performed using _LOCATION_ fractions from protoplasts co _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ using an _METHOD_ trap for the pull down of _METHOD_ tagged proteins and _METHOD_ antibodies for the western blot analysis of the interacting proteins . as shown in _METHOD_ pulled down _METHOD_ and to a lesser extent _METHOD_ but not mani _METHOD_ . similarly _METHOD_ pulled down both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . this suggests that heterotypic interactions can occur between arabidopsis proteins from the beta and delta subfamilies . interactions between proteins . co immunoprecipitation experiments . immunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins was performed using affinity purified antibodies against the c terminus of or . as a control control beads or antibodies against the n terminus of were used

_METHOD_ and mani _METHOD_ . bound proteins were analysed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and western blotting with antibodies against _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . in the case of protoplasts co _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and mani _METHOD_ no _METHOD_ signal was detected in the region _METHOD_ and no _METHOD_ signal was detected in the region _METHOD_ . i input _LOCATION_ u unspecific binding p pull down . finally a functional analysis of proteins in arabidopsis was attempted . since the single knock down/knock out mutants that were characterized did not show any obvious phenotypic alteration a gain of function approach was tried by overexpressing specific proteins and testing for an influence on the trafficking of putative cargos . for these studies the focus was on since its trafficking was previously characterized in the early secretory pathway and mutants were readily available . however the drawback of this strategy is the _PROTEIN_ that specific cargos have not yet been identified in plants . since proteins of the delta subfamily have been proposed to play a role in retrograde _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ transport it was thought that one good candidate might be _LOCATION_ a receptor which retrieves kdel/hdel containing cargo from the _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ . indeed there is one previous report showing that mammalian interacts with _LOCATION_ and is involved in its retrograde _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ transport . therefore _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ was transiently co _PROTEIN_ with increasing amounts of _METHOD_ . when _PROTEIN_ alone _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ localized _PROTEIN_ to punctate _LOCATION_ structures with a faint _LOCATION_ staining . overexpression of _METHOD_ produced a significant redistribution of _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ from the _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ . as quantified in _LOCATION_ localization of _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to in the presence of _METHOD_ . in the remaining protoplasts _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ localized either to the _LOCATION_ or to both the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . these experiments suggest that may play a role in retrograde _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ transport of _LOCATION_ . this was not a general effect on _LOCATION_ proteins since the standard _LOCATION_ marker mani _METHOD_ was still _LOCATION_ localized under the same conditions . interestingly this effect was not observed when we used an _METHOD_ mutant lacking the kk motif at the c terminus which is necessary for interaction with the _PROTEIN_ coat and therefore for retrograde _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ transport of . under these conditions _METHOD_ and _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ extensively co localized in punctate structures which based on previous results with this mutant should correspond either to the _LOCATION_ or to the pre _LOCATION_ compartment . in addition _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ was also localized to the _LOCATION_ as has been shown previously . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ partially relocalizes _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ to the _LOCATION_ . transient gene _PROTEIN_ in tobacco mesophyll protoplasts . _METHOD_ caused a partial relocalization of _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ to the _LOCATION_ although _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ also showed a punctate localization _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ almost completely co localized in punctate structures . _METHOD_ did not significantly change the localization of mani _METHOD_ . _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ showed mostly a _LOCATION_ localization when _PROTEIN_ alone . quantification of the localization of _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ alone or in the presence of _METHOD_ . eighty protoplasts showing comparable _PROTEIN_ levels of _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ mani _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were analysed per condition using identical laser output levels and imaging conditions . the localization of _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ was assigned as _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ and calculated as a percentage . _LOCATION_ bars represent the _PROTEIN_ . images in the panels show the most representative pattern found for each condition . scale bars .
