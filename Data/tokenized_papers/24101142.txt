plant auto inhibited _PROTEIN_ are crucial in defining the shape of calcium transients and therefore in eliciting plant responses to various stimuli . arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes ten aca _METHOD_ that can be divided into four clusters based on gene structure and sequence homology . while _METHOD_ from clusters and have been characterized virtually nothing is known about members of cluster _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . here we show that a _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ localizes at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and that _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ rescues the phenotype of partial male sterility of a null mutant of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ isoform _PROTEIN_ thus providing genetic evidence that _PROTEIN_ is a functional _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ resident _PROTEIN_ . by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in yeast and purification by cam affinity chromatography we show that unlike other acas the activity of _PROTEIN_ is not stimulated by cam . moreover full length _PROTEIN_ is able to rescue a yeast mutant deficient in calcium pumps . analysis of single point _PROTEIN_ mutants suggests that _PROTEIN_ loss of auto inhibition can be ascribed to the lack of two acidic conserved in other aca _METHOD_ at the cytoplasmic edge of the second and third transmembrane segments . together these results support a model in which the calcium pump activity of _PROTEIN_ is primarily regulated by increasing or _PROTEIN_ mrna _PROTEIN_ and/or protein translation and degradation .
to define the intracellular localization of _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fused _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the control of the promoter were generated and analyzed by confocal microscopy . figure shows that _METHOD_ _METHOD_ localizes at the periphery of the cells consistent with a pm localization of _PROTEIN_ . to confirm this indication roots were briefly exposed to the dye which under these conditions selectively labels the pm _METHOD_ and signals clearly co localize at cell periphery . based on these results we tested whether _PROTEIN_ was able to complement the pollen fertility phenotype of an _PROTEIN_ null mutant . _PROTEIN_ is a pm localized isoform primarily _PROTEIN_ in pollen and its deletion has been shown to reduce growth of pollen tubes with high frequency of aborted fertilization leading to a threefold reduction in seed set . results in fig . show that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ rescues the _PROTEIN_ mutant while that of _PROTEIN_ which encodes for an aca isoform localized at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ is unable to complement the defect . consistent with this difference in rescue potential _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was observed to localize at the pm in pollen whereas _PROTEIN_ was limited to the endomembranes . together these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is a functional pm pump . to biochemically characterize _PROTEIN_ plasmids encoding _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter were used to transform saccharomyces cerevisiae strain which lacks endogenous _PROTEIN_ . after induction of the yeast strain carrying _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ microsomes were isolated and solubilized microsomal proteins were subjected to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ blotted and decorated with the hisprobe _PROTEIN_ . after standard induction conditions the probe recognizes only a very faint band of the expected molecular _METHOD_ . however an increase in accumulation was observed if the temperature during induction was lowered to . nevertheless even in this condition _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ levels were very low compared to that of another aca isoform the signal in the lane containing a his tagged _PROTEIN_ is much stronger than that of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ although fold more microsomal proteins were loaded in the latter case moreover also under this conditions the hisprobe _PROTEIN_ labels several smaller bands indicative of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ degradation . attempts to improve _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ by further lowering the temperature of induction till by lowering concentration in the medium during induction to possibly select cells efficiently _PROTEIN_ the heterologous _PROTEIN_ or by changing promoter were unsuccessful . yeast strain being devoid of endogenous _PROTEIN_ is unable to grow in depleted media unless it _PROTEIN_ a deregulated form of aca . we checked whether at _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ allows growth in a depleted medium fig . shows that yeast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ grows in the presence of mm egta nearly as well as that _PROTEIN_ the deregulated _PROTEIN_ mutant while that _PROTEIN_ wt _PROTEIN_ is unable to grow under these conditions . this result indicates that the yeast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein is functional and not auto inhibited . a rescue was also obtained by transformation with an untagged _PROTEIN_ indicating that the wt protein is also _PROTEIN_ in a functional form and that the addition of the _METHOD_ did not somehow cause the tagged pump to become de regulated . given the low _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ it is extremely unlikely that yeast growth under selective conditions is enabled by some _PROTEIN_ fragment which has lost the auto inhibitory domain . however to evaluate this possibility we purified _PROTEIN_ from yeast using cam affinity chromatography and tested its biochemical properties . panel a in fig . shows the _PROTEIN_ fractions obtained from purification of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which can be easily monitored thanks to the his tag . upon overnight incubation with cam sepharose of the microsomal proteins solubilized from cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a relevant portion of the protein remains associated to the resin . the intact _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein is eluted upon chelation with mm egta while the his tagged lower molecular weight bands are undetectable in the egta eluted fraction . moreover the kda band is by far the most prominent after _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and silver staining of the egta eluted fraction indicating that this procedure allows the recovery of quite pure _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein albeit in tiny amounts . upon application of the same purification procedure to microsomes from cells _PROTEIN_ wt _PROTEIN_ a band of kda is prominent in the egta eluted fraction indicating that cam affinity also allows purification of the untagged _PROTEIN_ protein albeit still with low yield _PROTEIN_ . the purified _PROTEIN_ protein has _PROTEIN_ activity insensitive to cam even when supplied at concentration . _PROTEIN_ activity is inhibited by vanadate a well known inhibitor of p type _PROTEIN_ but in contrast with other acas is virtually unable to use itp as an alternative substrate . as with other acas _PROTEIN_ is inhibited by micromolar concentrations of eosin y a fluorescein derivative which acts as a competitive inhibitor with respect to the nucleoside triphosphate substrate however the effective concentrations are about order of magnitude higher that those required to inhibit _PROTEIN_ . the specific activity of the purified _PROTEIN_ is low as compared to the cam stimulated activity of _PROTEIN_ purified under the same conditions which ranges between and protein . this low activity is very unlikely to be an intrinsic characteristic of _PROTEIN_ since it is able to complement the phenotype despite its very low _PROTEIN_ level . rather it is probably due to protein damage during purification indeed the activity of purified _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by upon freezing and storage at and can be preserved overnight only by _PROTEIN_ the protein at in the presence of phosphatidylcholine . we tried to improve _PROTEIN_ activity by adding phospholipids during the solubilization and/or purification procedure without success . the finding that the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in mature leaves of transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the control of the promoter is fairly low suggests that protein instability might be an intrinsic feature of _PROTEIN_ . alignment of _PROTEIN_ with the other acas of arabidopsis shows that two residues crucial for auto inhibition of type _PROTEIN_ and conserved in all members of the other three clusters are variant in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ aligns with an asp and with a glu in acas belonging to the other three clusters . in studies on other aca _METHOD_ as well as on a pmca single point mutations of each of these two acidic residues respectively localized at the edge of and of generates constitutively active proteins insensitive to cam . we generated _PROTEIN_ mutants in which was mutated to asp and/or to glu all mutants are _PROTEIN_ in yeast at levels similar to that of the wt protein . while the _PROTEIN_ only partially impairs the ability of the construct to rescue the growth phenotype there was no rescue with a single substitution of _PROTEIN_ or a double substitution .
