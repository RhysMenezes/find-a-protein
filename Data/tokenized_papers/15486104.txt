we have investigated the subcellular localization the domain topology and the amino acid residues that are critical for the function of the presumptive arabidopsis thaliana auxin influx carrier _PROTEIN_ . biochemical fractionation experiments and confocal studies using an n terminal yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion observed that _PROTEIN_ colocalized with _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ markers . because of its pm localization we were able to take advantage of the steep ph gradient that exists across the plant cell pm to investigate _PROTEIN_ topology using _METHOD_ as a ph sensitive probe . the _METHOD_ coding sequence was inserted in selected _PROTEIN_ hydrophilic loops to orient surface domains on either apoplastic or cytoplasmic faces of the pm based on the absence or presence of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ respectively . we were able to demonstrate in conjunction with helix prediction _METHOD_ that _PROTEIN_ represents a polytopic _LOCATION_ protein composed of transmembrane spanning domains . in parallel a large _PROTEIN_ allelic series containing null partial loss of function and conditional mutations was characterized to identify the functionally important domains and amino acid residues within the _PROTEIN_ polypeptide . whereas almost all partial loss of function and null alleles cluster in the core permease region the sole conditional allele _PROTEIN_ modifies the function of the external c terminal domain .
as a component of the auxin uptake carrier _PROTEIN_ is predicted to function at the plant cell _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . we employed two distinct fractionation and confocal confirm _PROTEIN_ pm localization . _LOCATION_ were prepared using arabidopsis root cultures because _PROTEIN_ localization revealed a pattern identical to that described for young seedling root cells by citation . total soluble and microsomal fractions were prepared from arabidopsis root cultures protein gel blotted and then probed using an anti _PROTEIN_ peptide antiserum . the amino acid n terminal sequence of _PROTEIN_ was selected as the peptide antigen for antibody production because it represents the most divergent segment of protein coding sequence among the four members of the arabidopsis aux/lax family . to confirm that the anti _PROTEIN_ antiserum did not cross react with other members of the _PROTEIN_ protein family samples were prepared from the wild type and the t dna tagged _PROTEIN_ null mutant . a cross reacting band was detectable in the wild type samples but not _PROTEIN_ confirming the specificity of the antiserum for _PROTEIN_ . in the wild type extract _PROTEIN_ was detected in the total protein sample was absent from the soluble fraction and was enriched in the microsomal fraction consistent with the predicted _LOCATION_ localization . further resolution of _PROTEIN_ subcellular localization was obtained using sucrose density based organelle fractionation . microsomes isolated from the wild type _LOCATION_ were subjected to subfractionation on a continuous sucrose gradient . a selection of biochemical and immunological organelle markers were used to identify tonoplast _LOCATION_ pm and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fractions . the antipeptide antiserum detected the majority of _PROTEIN_ in sucrose gradient fractions comigrating with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ h _PROTEIN_ marker . a small proportion of _PROTEIN_ was also detected in the highest density part of the gradient which also contains traces of the pm and _LOCATION_ markers the signal may represent a small proportion of _PROTEIN_ that resides in another compartment such as the _LOCATION_ or it may be from larger aggregated _LOCATION_ fragments which can tend to accumulate here during gradient fractionation . however as seen in figure _PROTEIN_ separates predominantly with the pm enriched fractions in sucrose gradient centrifugation . a confocal microscopy based approach independently verified our subcellular fractionation results . a transgenic arabidopsis line _PROTEIN_ an n terminal translational fusion between the _PROTEIN_ and yellow _METHOD_ proteins _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of the native _PROTEIN_ promoter was crossed with the promoter driven pm marker line _METHOD_ . the spectral separation capabilities of confocal microscopy enabled us to individually image the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ fusion proteins in seedling roots _PROTEIN_ both transgenes . the n _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein appeared to localize to the pm of root cells in a manner identical to the localization of the _METHOD_ pm marker . overlaying these images revealed that n _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ were colocalized . _METHOD_ has a pka value above with _METHOD_ emission abrogated below ph meaning that the fluorescing n _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein is unlikely to be exposed to the ph conditions measured in the apoplastic space of root cells . indeed transgenic root cells continued to emit _METHOD_ _METHOD_ even when the external media was buffered to ph . the _METHOD_ domain of the n terminal _PROTEIN_ fusion is not therefore oriented on the apoplastic face of the pm of root cells . if oriented in the cytoplasm we would expect n _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to be sensitive to cytoplasmic acidification . treatment of arabidopsis seedling roots with the weak _LOCATION_ permeable acid mm propionic acid has been reported to cause rapid cytoplasmic acidification dropping from ph to within min . when we exposed transgenic root cells to identical experimental conditions n _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was significantly reduced within min . we conclude from our confocal results that the n terminal _METHOD_ domain of the _PROTEIN_ fusion must be oriented cytoplasmically . when this information is combined with our subcellular fractionation results we can conclude that the _METHOD_ domain of the _PROTEIN_ fusion must be oriented on the cytoplasmic face of the pm of root cells . as a member of the auxin amino acid permease family _PROTEIN_ is predicted to function as an integral _LOCATION_ protein whose transmembrane domains repeatedly span the pm . eleven tm helix prediction _METHOD_ have been employed to model _PROTEIN_ topology using the _PROTEIN_ database . their consensus predicts that the _PROTEIN_ protein contains tm domains and that its n and c terminal domains reside outside the cell . however the latter prediction is inconsistent with the ability of the n _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein to fluoresce in the pm of transgenic root cells and the absence of either a cleavable or noncleavable signal sequence that would be required by the _PROTEIN_ n terminus to traverse the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . given the discrepancy between the predicted and experimental data we decided to directly test _PROTEIN_ topology in planta by creating a series of additional _METHOD_ translational fusions in the first and second hydrophilic loops predicted within the _PROTEIN_ protein sequence by the _PROTEIN_ database . we would then assess whether the particular _PROTEIN_ hydrophilic domain that _METHOD_ was inserted into was oriented internally or externally on the basis of the presence or absence of _METHOD_ respectively . to create these _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions an in frame kpni restriction enzyme site was engineered into the _PROTEIN_ gene by pcr mutagenesis after codons and then the full length _METHOD_ coding sequence was cloned at the engineered kpni sites of the _PROTEIN_ gene to create the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenes respectively . transgenic _PROTEIN_ roots _PROTEIN_ each _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene was imaged using confocal microscopy . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein exhibited strong protein _METHOD_ indicative that its domain was orientated in the cytoplasm . by contrast transgenic root cells _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein did not fluoresce consistent with its domain being extracytoplasmic . immunolocalization of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion was necessary to demonstrate that the loss of _METHOD_ was because of its protein topology rather than destabilization . anti _METHOD_ antibodies revealed that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein was _PROTEIN_ and targeted identically to both n _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . hence loss of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was consistent with its hydrophilic loop projecting into the low ph environment of the apoplastic space . our experimental results demonstrate that the first hydrophobic region which the n _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusions flank must be composed of not one but two tm domains for both fusion proteins to orient _METHOD_ on the cytoplasmic pm face . this explanation is further strengthened by the observed extracytoplasmic orientation of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion . we therefore conclude from our _METHOD_ based topological studies that _PROTEIN_ contains not but _METHOD_ consistent with results obtained for another member of the auxin amino acid permease family _PROTEIN_ using an epitope tagged recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ in animal tissue culture cells . little is known about the functionally important residues and domains that are critical for _PROTEIN_ activity . molecular and phenotypic characterization of a series of allelic mutations provides a very effective experimental approach to investigate such functionally important features . we have assembled a large _PROTEIN_ allelic series including newly isolated and two previously identified missense mutations . new _PROTEIN_ alleles were isolated from two _METHOD_ mutagenized populations that were screened for seedling roots exhibiting resistance to a concentration of the synthetic auxin d that inhibits wild type root elongation . forty one of the seedlings recovered were _PROTEIN_ shown to be allelic to _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ alleles were isolated from of the pools screened and were therefore likely to represent a large number of independent mutations within the _PROTEIN_ gene . to determine the molecular basis of each mutation rt pcr was performed to amplify the mutated _PROTEIN_ cdna template which was then sequenced . each mutation was confirmed by sequencing the corresponding region of genomic dna . the molecular lesions for new and existing _PROTEIN_ alleles were determined . with the exception of t dna tagged _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ alleles in which a single base deletion resulted in a frame shift all other mutations arose from single base substitutions within the transcribed _PROTEIN_ sequence . of the _PROTEIN_ alleles described in this study represent independent novel missense alleles . the frequency of the missense alleles along the length of the amino acid sequence was plotted to identify functionally important regions in _PROTEIN_ . the amino acids were first divided into five windows of amino acids then a q value was calculated for each window to assess the statistical probability of the observed distribution being significantly different from a poisson prediction of random distribution . windows with high q values are those in which significantly more or fewer missense mutations are observed than would be expected by random distribution . eight of the missense alleles occurred in the to window which exhibits a q value implying a > probability that the larger number of mutations occurring in this window is not by chance . the q value is still > when taking into account the gc content of this window given the preference of _METHOD_ for causing g to a mutations . this region therefore appears to be particularly important for _PROTEIN_ function . summary of missense substitutions in the _PROTEIN_ allelic series and their properties the number of non sense mutations versus other classes of mutations was double the theoretically expected value _PROTEIN_ suggesting that mutations which do not cause a loss of function must occur but were not recovered in our d screen . this could imply that fewer loss of function mutations occur in some regions of the _PROTEIN_ sequence than others . only one missense mutation was recovered in the n terminal third of the _PROTEIN_ primary sequence suggesting that this region may tolerate amino acid substitutions more than the to window . to probe the functional importance of the n terminal third of _PROTEIN_ we examined whether the n _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins retained biological activity . each of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenes described in figure had originally been transformed into the null _PROTEIN_ mutant background allowing us to assess whether any of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions retained biological activity on the basis of complementation of the _PROTEIN_ root defect . root gravitropic assays revealed that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene was able to rescue the _PROTEIN_ agravitropic phenotype and restore a wild type level of d sensitivity . neither the n _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ nor _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins rescued _PROTEIN_ gravitropism despite a slight reversal of the _PROTEIN_ d insensitive root phenotype . the reduced activity of either fusion is unlikely to be attributable to the _METHOD_ insertion causing _PROTEIN_ misfolding because we would expect the proteins to be degraded as observed for a c terminal _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion and several missense alleles . neither can the reduction in n _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ activity be explained by loss of protein stability or targeting because both fusion proteins were clearly detectable and exhibited a pattern of localization identical to the functional _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion . instead the n terminal and loop regions appear to be important for _PROTEIN_ function once the protein is localized at the root cell pm by possibly impairing functionally important protein protein interactions . by contrast _METHOD_ inserted into the cytoplasmic loop does not disrupt _PROTEIN_ protein function . our _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ results suggest that selected regions within the n terminal third of the _PROTEIN_ primary sequence can indeed tolerate modifications without loss of protein function . a search of the entire _PROTEIN_ primary amino acid sequence revealed it to be consistent with earlier assignments to the subfamily of _LOCATION_ spanning permeases with specificity for amino acids or related compounds . additionally consensus sites were identified for posttranslational modifications including n myristoylation n glycosylation and protein kinase c and casein kinase ii phosphorylation sites . of the missense mutations occur within both the core permease region of the protein and nine of these map to individual predicted transmembrane regions . a further mutation _PROTEIN_ maps to a potential n myristoylation site located close to the end of predicted . a clustal primary sequence alignment between _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ revealed that several of the _PROTEIN_ missense alleles result from amino acid substitutions at highly conserved residues . for example the gly residue substituted in the _PROTEIN_ allele was highlighted by citation as part of one of the most highly conserved motifs shared among the aaap family of proteins . nevertheless the importance of the majority of the residues identified in the _PROTEIN_ allelic series could not have been inferred on the basis of their sequence conservation alone highlighting the effectiveness of our forward genetic approach compared with site directed mutagenesis to identify functionally important amino acids . the root gravitropic response of each missense mutant was assayed to discriminate between null and partial loss of function _PROTEIN_ alleles . vertically grown seedlings were given a gravity stimulus for h before measuring the angle of root curvature . all wild type roots responded to the gravity stimulus by turning between and within h . eighteen of the _PROTEIN_ alleles exhibited a fully agravitropic root growth behavior identical to the non sense allele _PROTEIN_ . roots from the missense alleles _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ exhibited a nonrandom pattern of root growth after the gravity stimulus suggesting that they may retain partial _PROTEIN_ function . elongation assays observed that the four _PROTEIN_ alleles exhibited a sensitivity to auxin which was intermediate to null _PROTEIN_ and wild type roots implying that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ represented partial loss of function alleles . it was necessary to establish the basis for the partial loss of function phenotypes of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ alleles compared with the null phenotype of other _PROTEIN_ mutants . to assess whether this simply reflected the differential stability of partial loss of function versus null mutant proteins root microsomes from all loss of function _PROTEIN_ missense alleles described were characterized by protein gel blot immunodetection using an anti _PROTEIN_ anti peptide antiserum . _PROTEIN_ was detected in all null and partial loss of function missense alleles with the exception of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . instead the phenotypic severity predicted for each _PROTEIN_ missense mutant appeared to more closely correlate with the chemical relatedness of the amino acid side chain that substituted the original wild type residue . missense substitutions in null _PROTEIN_ alleles had phcd values above whereas partial loss of function _PROTEIN_ alleles has phcd values below . the single exception to this trend is the ser to asn substitution at amino acid in the _PROTEIN_ allele which has a low phcd value of but causes a null phenotype . citation reported that the _PROTEIN_ allele was conditional the root defects could be rescued by a gamma pyronyl triterpenoid saponin chromosaponin i . we tested whether any other _PROTEIN_ alleles were conditional by examining if csi could restore their root gravitropic phenotypes of a selection of _PROTEIN_ missense mutants . the effects of csi on the root gravitropic response of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and alleles was examined after a gravity stimulus . with the exception of _PROTEIN_ csi failed to restore the gravitropic phenotype of the remaining _PROTEIN_ missense alleles . conversely csi treatment completely blocked the partial gravitropic response of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ alleles and also impaired the wild type controls response . the allele specific rescue of _PROTEIN_ gravitropism by csi suggests that the saponin does not bypass the requirement for a functioning influx carrier by nonspecifically permeabilizing plant cell to auxin . instead our results suggest that csi rescues _PROTEIN_ gravitropism by either interacting with the mutant c terminal domain to restore _PROTEIN_ function or via an another mutation in the _PROTEIN_ background . to discriminate between these possibilities we examined whether csi was able to rescue gravitropism of a null _PROTEIN_ line _PROTEIN_ a ha _PROTEIN_ transgene . we reengineered the ha _PROTEIN_ transgene to include the _PROTEIN_ mutation then transformed the ha _PROTEIN_ transgene into a null _PROTEIN_ background . unlike the wild type ha _PROTEIN_ transgene ha _PROTEIN_ transgene lines did not rescue the agravitropic phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutant allele . however root gravitropism could be restored when either ha _PROTEIN_ or seedlings were grown in the presence of csi . hence the allele specific rescue of _PROTEIN_ gravitropism by csi must be attributable to a direct interaction between the saponin and mutant c terminal domain . csi could rescue _PROTEIN_ gravitropism by either restoring ha _PROTEIN_ protein targeting and/or permease activities . we investigated whether the _PROTEIN_ genetic lesion disrupted _PROTEIN_ protein targeting using an immunolocalization approach . confocal microscopy revealed that ha _PROTEIN_ localization in root apical cells was identical to the wild type ha _PROTEIN_ control . for example the mutant ha _PROTEIN_ and wild type ha _PROTEIN_ proteins were pm localized in _PROTEIN_ root cap cells . similarly localization of the mutant ha _PROTEIN_ protein in protophloem cells was identical to wild type ha _PROTEIN_ . we conclude from the wild type localization of the ha _PROTEIN_ protein that this mutation in the c terminal domain influences _PROTEIN_ activity rather than protein targeting .

function missense mutants . at a p value of missense lof mutations in _PROTEIN_ are significantly more likely to occur in gs and cs of gly and met than in gs and cs of other amino acid codons . these
