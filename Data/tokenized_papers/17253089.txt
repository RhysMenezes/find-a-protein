the arabidopsis genome contains seven cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors which share a small conserved c terminal domain responsible for the cdk inhibition activity by these proteins . different ick/krps have been shown to have unique _PROTEIN_ patterns within tissues organs and during the cell cycle . previous studies have shown that overexpressing one of the ick/krps inhibits cdk activity cell division and profoundly affects plant growth and development . in this study we investigated the subcellular localization of the seven arabidopsis ick proteins and domains responsible for this localization . using transgenic _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis plants and transient _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaf cells all ick/krps fused to green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ were localized to the _LOCATION_ suggesting that the _LOCATION_ is the cellular compartment for the plant cdk inhibitors to function . while _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were localized to the nucleoplasm in a homogeneous manner _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ showed a punctate pattern of localization . a small motif conserved amongst the latter group of ick/krps is required to confer this subcellular pattern as deletion of this motif from _PROTEIN_ resulted in a shift from a punctate to a homogeneous pattern of localization . while a single _LOCATION_ localization signal is responsible for the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ multiple _METHOD_ for _LOCATION_ localization are suggested to exist for the other six ick/krps since deletion mutants lacking predicted nls motifs and the conserved c terminal domain are still localized in the _LOCATION_ .
to discover any _LOCATION_ targeting information within the coding sequences of the icks two independent software analysis tools were used predictnls and psort . predictnls uses a database of experimentally demonstrated nls motifs to identify the likelihood of a similar sequence within the query sequence . psort _METHOD_ uses an algorithm based on both the four amino acid nls typified by the large t antigen and the bipartite nls proposed by in xenopus nucleoplasmin . because the predictnls analysis is based on experimental data it presumably offers a prediction that would likely have fewer false positives while the latter may offer greater sensitivity to potential nlss but more false positives . both psort and predictnls predicted an nls within the first amino acids of _PROTEIN_ . no nls was found in _PROTEIN_ using predictnls analysis while psort suggested the presence of an nls at residues . _PROTEIN_ was not predicted to possess an nls by either analysis . two nlss were predicted by psort to exist within the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence one at amino acids and the second at . similar to _PROTEIN_ no nls was predicted by either method for _PROTEIN_ . for _PROTEIN_ both psort and predictnls identified a single putative nls at residues . while _PROTEIN_ has been shown to be localized to the _LOCATION_ the remaining six arabidopsis ick/krps have not been characterized as to their subcellular location . based on the software assisted analysis it was predicted that ick/krps would be localized to the _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ depending on the absence or presence of an nls respectively . to investigate the location of _PROTEIN_ through _PROTEIN_ the corresponding arabidopsis cdnas were cloned into a plant _PROTEIN_ vector to _PROTEIN_ each of the ick/krps in plants as a fusion to the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . these constructs were tested by transient _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaf epidermal cells . in contrast to our predictions based on the bioinformatic analysis all _METHOD_ ick fusion proteins were detected exclusively within the _LOCATION_ . it was further observed that similar to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ showed a pattern of localization with minute punctate regions of brighter _METHOD_ within the _LOCATION_ . counterstaining with dapi revealed that these densely staining regions appeared to co localize to some extent but not completely with the dapi stained regions . in contrast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ did not show this punctate subnuclear pattern and the _METHOD_ was largely uniform within the nucleoplasm . localization of these _METHOD_ ick fusions was noticeably weaker in areas rich with heterochromatin . in all cases _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was excluded from nucleoli . to test if the patterns of localization within tobacco epidermal cells would be consistent with localization in the native system arabidopsis plants were transformed with _METHOD_ tagged ick genes under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . as observed in tobacco epidermal cells the _METHOD_ fusion proteins of ick/krps were all localized in the _LOCATION_ . furthermore _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were _LOCATION_ localized with punctate spots of _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which showed homogeneous distribution throughout the nucleoplasm in tobacco cells displayed the same pattern in arabidopsis _LOCATION_ . these results indicate that ick/krps showed similar _LOCATION_ localization patterns in tobacco and arabidopsis cells and thus the tobacco system can be used for identifying sequences in ick/krps regulating the localization patterns . to identify sequences necessary for the _LOCATION_ and subnuclear localization observed for icks we prepared a series of deletions for the coding regions of ick/krps . all arabidopsis ick/krps share a conserved c terminal domain required for the interactions of _PROTEIN_ with cdka and d type cyclins . furthermore it was shown that a larger c terminal fragment containing this conserved domain confers _LOCATION_ localization of _METHOD_ . therefore to determine additional sequences responsible for subcellular targeting other than this domain we chose to omit the conserved c terminal region in the deletion constructs . _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaf epidermal cells of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ which lacks the first amino acids of _PROTEIN_ resulted in largely _LOCATION_ localization of _METHOD_ . conversely _PROTEIN_ of the first amino acids of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ resulted in only _LOCATION_ localization indicating that this region contains a functional nls as predicted by sequence analysis . this suggests that a single nls is sufficient and necessary for complete _LOCATION_ localization in _PROTEIN_ . a c terminal deletion mutant consisting of only the first residues of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ resulted in a similar pattern of localization as the full length _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with only the central region of _PROTEIN_ also showed the same pattern of localization . _PROTEIN_ with only the first amino acids was still sufficient to target _METHOD_ to the _LOCATION_ despite lacking the putative nls as predicted by psort . notably a punctate pattern of subnuclear distribution was observed for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ similar to that for the full length fusion protein . these results suggest that the conserved cdka/cyclind binding domain at the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ is not required for _LOCATION_ localization . furthermore information sufficient to confer _LOCATION_ localization is present in _PROTEIN_ between residues although no conserved motif or _LOCATION_ localization sequence can be found in this region . a c terminal deletion of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lacking the conserved cdka/cyclind binding domain was still localized to the _LOCATION_ . this observation suggests that the conserved c terminus is not required for _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ . moreover since sequence analysis did not find a typical nls an unidentified domain is present within residues sufficient for _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ . similar to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a deletion of _PROTEIN_ that lacked the conserved c terminal domain was localized to the _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ a further deletion lacking the second putative nls was still localized to the _LOCATION_ . even when only the first residues of _PROTEIN_ were fused to _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ localization was still observed . however a small amount of cytoplasmic _METHOD_ was observed for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ as compared with no detectable cytoplasmic _METHOD_ for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . this observation suggests that the predicted nls near the n terminus is not sufficient for exclusive _LOCATION_ localization and complete _LOCATION_ localization or retention requires additional information provided by other sequences in _PROTEIN_ . while no nls was predicted to exist in _PROTEIN_ two deletions _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ consisting of either the first or amino acids both showed _LOCATION_ localization of _METHOD_ . similar to _PROTEIN_ the same punctate pattern was observed for the full length _PROTEIN_ as well as for the two _PROTEIN_ deletion constructs tested . since _PROTEIN_ retained the punctate pattern these results together suggest that a domain conferring _LOCATION_ localization as well as the punctate pattern of subnuclear distribution exists within amino acids of _PROTEIN_ . two c terminal deletions of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lacking the conserved c terminal domain but retaining the predicted nls were localized to the _LOCATION_ in a pattern similar to the full length protein . _PROTEIN_ a deletion of _PROTEIN_ lacking the putative nls was still retained in the _LOCATION_ but did not show the subnuclear pattern observed for the full length _PROTEIN_ . instead this deletion mutant was localized within the _LOCATION_ in a homogeneous manner . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ contains at least two independent sequences sufficient for _LOCATION_ localization . furthermore a domain within the first residues confers the observed punctate pattern of sub _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ .
