higher plants contain biologically active proteins that are recognized by antibodies against human atrial natriuretic peptide _PROTEIN_ . we identified and isolated two arabidopsis thaliana immunoreactive plant natriuretic peptide _PROTEIN_ encoding genes atpnp a and atpnp b which are distantly related members of the expansin superfamily and have a role in the regulation of homeostasis in abiotic and biotic stresses and have shown that atpnp a modulates the effects of aba on stomata . arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in leaf mesophyll cells and in protoplast assays we demonstrate that it is secreted using atpnp a green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ reporter constructs and flow cytometry . transient reporter assays provide evidence that atpnp a _PROTEIN_ is enhanced by heat osmotica and salt and that atpnp a itself can enhance its own _PROTEIN_ thereby generating a response signature diagnostic for paracrine action and potentially also autocrine effects . _PROTEIN_ of native atpnp a is enhanced by osmotica and transiently by salt . although atpnp a _PROTEIN_ is induced by salt and osmotica aba does not significantly modulate atpnp a levels nor does recombinant atpnp a affect reporter _PROTEIN_ of the aba responsive _PROTEIN_ gene . together these results provide experimental evidence that atpnp a is stress responsive secreted into the apoplastic space and can enhance its own _PROTEIN_ . furthermore our findings support the idea that atpnp a together with aba is an important component in complex plant stress responses and that much like in animals peptide signaling molecules can create diverse and modular signals essential for growth development and defense under rapidly changing environmental conditions .
_PROTEIN_ was initially isolated from leaf tissue and we tested the spatial pattern of _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ using a propnp a gus _PROTEIN_ fusion construct containing a kb sequence upstream of atpnp a. plants were grown for weeks and three plants with positive gus staining and the presence of propnp a gus confirmed by pcr amplification were identified from randomly selected plants . the staining was located _PROTEIN_ in the mesophyll tissue of leaves and partly in the cortex tissue of petioles and _METHOD_ . gus activity was not detected in roots . this confirmed that _PROTEIN_ a was _PROTEIN_ and produced _PROTEIN_ in leaf mesophyll tissue during vegetative growth therefore making protoplasts isolated from mesophyll cells of to week old plants a suitable research platform for investigations into _PROTEIN_ a function at the cellular level . although sequence analysis suggested that _PROTEIN_ a contains a signal sequence targeting the protein to the _LOCATION_ space this has not been experimentally proven . protoplasts were transfected with different plasmids to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a tagged with green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ at the n or c terminus . _METHOD_ production in the protoplasts was assessed h after transfection by flow cytometry and biparametrically analyzed outputs are shown as dot plots . equal numbers of the total protoplast populations were measured in the event for each sample . the event shows the range of protoplasts that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in each sample . the control protoplasts had near zero levels of protoplasts showing green _METHOD_ . protoplasts transfected with the plasmid containing the full length _PROTEIN_ a coding sequence fused with _METHOD_ at the c terminus _METHOD_ had similar outputs to the controls with almost no detectable _METHOD_ in the protoplasts . however populations of signalpnp _METHOD_ or signal _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ transfected protoplasts together with their incubation solution displayed higher _METHOD_ readings than the controls indicating that _METHOD_ fusion proteins were actually produced by the transfected protoplasts but delivered outside the protoplasts by processes triggered by the signaling peptide . protoplasts transfected with the other plasmids _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ showed considerable _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ within the protoplasts . these outcomes demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ a could only be secreted when its n terminal signaling peptide is present and that in the absence of it or when it is blocked by the n terminal _METHOD_ the proteins remain trapped in the protoplasts . to confirm this result we transiently transfected onion epidermal peel cells with signalpnp _METHOD_ where _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is evident h after transformation . since _PROTEIN_ a can be exported from mesophyll cells we used a promoter reporter system to examine _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ to ensure we were observing all the protein induced without complications from natural protein secretion . using this method we could also compare _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ with induction of a gene up regulated by aba . the _PROTEIN_ gene is regulated through a cis acting element _PROTEIN_ that interacts with three dres present to regulate gene _PROTEIN_ by aba and abiotic stresses such as dehydration and salinity . we used the luc reporter cassette to determine if recombinant _PROTEIN_ a modulates aba induced gene _PROTEIN_ as _PROTEIN_ a was shown to modulate the effect of aba in guard cells . as predicted the _PROTEIN_ promoter was up regulated in the presence of aba with a significant increase in transcript accumulation at aba where a plateau effect was established . the addition of recombinant _PROTEIN_ a did not change the aba response of the _PROTEIN_ promoter . in addition we also demonstrate using the gus construct as an internal transfection control that in our system we could reliably normalize the luc _PROTEIN_ against protoplast protein levels . moreover neither recombinant _PROTEIN_ a nor its second messenger cgmp added as the _LOCATION_ permeant br cgmp affected _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ promoter . in a second set of experiments we transiently co transfected protoplasts with propnp a luc and gus and found that we could normalize our propnp a luc results against protoplast protein levels . recombinant _PROTEIN_ a itself induced a small but significant increase in propnp a luc _PROTEIN_ . however neither aba nor br cgmp had any effect on propnp a luc _PROTEIN_ . in a subsequent series of experiments we tested the effect of abiotic stresses on protoplasts transiently transfected with luc or propnp a luc . as predicted luc _PROTEIN_ was significantly increased in response to heat salinity and osmotica h after transfection . the propnp a luc activity revealed that the _PROTEIN_ a promoter was also significantly up regulated by high temperature salinity and osmoticum at h. rt qpcr was used to analyze mrna levels for _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ in mesophyll protoplasts under different stress conditions . the ubq gene served as a reference as it is one of the more stable reference genes . the relative _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ a transcript was markedly enhanced at and h in response to treatment with _PROTEIN_ a itself whereas the other treatments had little or no effect on _PROTEIN_ a transcript _PROTEIN_ . continuous incubation showed that the mrna levels of _PROTEIN_ a were higher under the conditions of heat and aba as well as _PROTEIN_ a itself after h . western blotting was carried out to determine the translational _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ a in wild type protoplasts using rabbit polyclonal antibodies to _PROTEIN_ a that we have characterized previously . the odyssey infrared imaging system was used to quantify the protein levels and it can be seen that basal levels of _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ are low possibly because _PROTEIN_ is being secreted as demonstrated in figs . and . we detected transient increases in _PROTEIN_ a protein levels in response to salt conditions while responses to osmotic conditions were slower and more pronounced which correlates with the propnp a luc reporter experiments . only slight increases in _PROTEIN_ a protein levels were detected in the recombinant _PROTEIN_ a treatments and this is similar to results from the propnp a luc reporter experiments shown in fig . .
