light is an important environmental _PROTEIN_ that modulates acclimation strategies and defense responses in plants . we explored the functional role of the regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase _PROTEIN_ in light dependent stress responses of arabidopsis . the predominant form of _PROTEIN_ consists of catalytic subunit c scaffold subunit a and highly variable regulatory subunit b which determines the substrate specificity of _PROTEIN_ holoenzymes . mutant leaves of knockdown _PROTEIN_ plants show disintegration of chloroplasts and premature yellowing conditionally under moderate light intensity . the cell death phenotype is accompanied by the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide through a pathway that requires _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of pr _PROTEIN_ . moreover the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant additionally displays growth suppression and malformed trichomes . similar to _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ mutant shows constitutive activation of both salicylic acid and jasmonic acid dependent defense pathways . in contrast to _PROTEIN_ however _PROTEIN_ leaves do not contain increased levels of salicylic acid or jasmonic acid . rather the constitutive defense response associates with hypomethylation of dna and increased levels of methionine salvage pathway components in _PROTEIN_ leaves . we suggest that the specific subunit of _PROTEIN_ is functionally connected to _PROTEIN_ and operates in the basal repression of defense responses under low irradiance .
we took a reverse genetic approach to identify components that specifically modulate the capacity of plants to tolerate different light intensities . the _PROTEIN_ mutant deficient in a specific regulatory subunit of _PROTEIN_ was chosen for further analysis since it showed an intriguing phenotype with wrinkled leaves stunted growth delayed flowering and age dependent formation of yellowing lesions when grown under a moderate growth light intensity of photons . the premature wilting was reflected by reduced seed production capacity of the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . notably a knockout line deficient in the _PROTEIN_ protein whose amino acid sequence is identical with that of _PROTEIN_ revealed no visual phenotype . n for flowering time n for seed production and n for photosynthesis activity measurement . the asterisks denote that the t test p value is below . sequencing over the t dna border of _PROTEIN_ plants revealed an insertion in the untranslated region of the _PROTEIN_ gene . analysis by quantitative real time pcr confirmed lower _PROTEIN_ transcript abundance in _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ . no rna interference lines or additional t dna lines with insertion in the transcribed region of _GENE_ were available for parallel analysis . thus to genetically complement the mutation we introduced the _PROTEIN_ protein coding sequence under the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter into _PROTEIN_ . in this complementation line somewhat variable levels of _PROTEIN_ mrna were detected but the growth rate was restored and no premature yellowing was observed . it is worth noting that driven _PROTEIN_ of a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ fusion construct in _PROTEIN_ failed to complement the mutation . on the other hand overexpression of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion construct in wild type arabidopsis plants resulted in a yellowing phenotype which highly resembled that of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . this was likely due to a dominant negative effect on the _PROTEIN_ complex and not due to cosuppression of _PROTEIN_ since the abundance of _PROTEIN_ mrna in the line _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was found to be fold higher than that of the wild type plants . among hundreds of transgenic seedlings screened for the presence of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ only a few individuals showed _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in cotyledons but all these individuals failed in development and wilted before the appearance of the first true leaves . imaging of arabidopsis protoplasts transiently overexpressing the fusion construct however revealed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ predominantly in the cytoplasm as also recently reported by citation . similar to attempts to visualize _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ detection of _PROTEIN_ by immunoblotting using an antibody raised against _PROTEIN_ repeatedly failed presumably due to low abundance of _PROTEIN_ . indeed when _PROTEIN_ was produced in bacteria the protein could be detected by anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies . to obtain insights into the pattern of _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ the uida gene was introduced into wild type arabidopsis plants and _PROTEIN_ under the _PROTEIN_ promoter consisting of a kb region upstream of the translational start codon on the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence . subsequent gus analyses demonstrated that in rosette leaves the _PROTEIN_ promoter was active in patches that highly resembled the yellowing areas which developed on _PROTEIN_ mutant leaves upon aging . within these peripheral patches also the veins showed _PROTEIN_ promoter driven gus activity . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is a low abundance signaling component that is specifically _PROTEIN_ in limited areas in leaves . microscopic examination revealed distinct abnormalities in the mesophyll tissue of _PROTEIN_ plants well before visual detection of yellowing patches under moderate light intensity . in the palisade parenchyma cells of _PROTEIN_ leaves of the chloroplasts were roundish and/or showed loosening of the photosynthetic _LOCATION_ which is a phenomenon normally observed at early phases of senescence . in wild type leaves such degrading chloroplasts were not observed . in the spongy mesophyll tissue of _PROTEIN_ of chloroplasts showed distinct _METHOD_ of degeneration and some of the chloroplasts contained _LOCATION_ free extrusions . intriguingly the spongy mesophyll tissue of _PROTEIN_ also contained separate cells with a curving _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ indicative of cell death in this specific cell type . confocal microscopy imaging of propidium iodide stained leaf tissue also revealed separate cells with extensive cell shrinkage and intense propidium iodide staining of _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ leaves indicative of cell death . in the remaining _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ however the photosynthetic _LOCATION_ protein complexes remained intact and the net _PROTEIN_ assimilation did not significantly differ between wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants either . collectively the knockdown of _PROTEIN_ promoted senescence like _METHOD_ suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ activity mediated by is required for the _PROTEIN_ of cellular integrity in arabidopsis leaves . comparative transcript profiling of _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants grown for weeks under moderate light intensity revealed constitutively elevated transcript levels of defense related genes in _PROTEIN_ plants . the most distinct response was a several fold increase in _PROTEIN_ of salicylic acid related components including _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ isochorismate phytoalexin _PROTEIN_ and enhanced disease _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . furthermore _PROTEIN_ plants showed higher _PROTEIN_ levels of resistance genes encoding intracellular toll interleukin nucleotide binding leu rich repeat receptors coiled coil nucleotide binding leu rich repeat receptors as well as leu rich repeat class disease resistance proteins . finally the constitutive defense response of _PROTEIN_ manifested as enhanced _PROTEIN_ of genes coding for _LOCATION_ h type thioredoxins chitinases glutathione s transferases and other defense related genes . besides sa related signaling components _PROTEIN_ plants also showed higher _PROTEIN_ levels of genes related to the biosynthesis of ja or et compared with the wild type . two genes coding for aminocyclopropane _PROTEIN_ oxidases three genes coding for allene oxide synthases lipoxygenase and oxophytodienoate reductase were induced in _PROTEIN_ as compared with wild type plants . also the et/ja marker genes encoding plant _PROTEIN_ and a tyr aminotransferase were induced in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . three general ros markers _GENE_ and showed slightly elevated transcript levels in _PROTEIN_ plants . among antioxidant enzymes transcript levels for iron superoxide dismutase chloroplast nadph dependent thioredoxin reductase glutathione peroxidase and catalase were lowered in _PROTEIN_ . in contrast transcript levels for two genes encoding chloroplastic monodehydroascorbate reductases three encoding met sulfoxide reductases five encoding thioredoxin family proteins and one for catalase _PROTEIN_ were higher in _PROTEIN_ as compared with wild type plants . moreover slightly increased _PROTEIN_ of cell death antagonists including _GENE_ and _GENE_ which have a role in the suppression of associated x protein induced programmed cell death was also observed in _PROTEIN_ . altogether _PROTEIN_ plants show a constitutive reprogramming of transcript accumulation for ros sa and ja/et responsive genes . next we compared the transcript profiles of week old _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants grown under normal growth light or under high light . differences in transcript profiles of the wild type and _PROTEIN_ were particularly pronounced when the plants were grown under normal growth light conditions where differential regulation of genes was observed . of these showed elevated transcript levels in _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type . in high light grown _PROTEIN_ plants the number of differentially _PROTEIN_ genes was of which showed increased transcript levels . associated with a partial dampening of defense gene _PROTEIN_ also the yellowing phenotype of _PROTEIN_ could be rescued upon growth under high light . similar to _PROTEIN_ the lesion mimic mutant _PROTEIN_ also showed up regulation of sa and ja marker genes and underwent premature senescence when grown under moderate growth light conditions . thus we tested the genetic interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . parallel growth of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ revealed that the onset of yellowing occurred somewhat earlier in _PROTEIN_ . with respect to yellowing the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant resembled _PROTEIN_ . however the growth rate of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was reduced as compared with either of the parental lines . when grown under high light intensity the growth rate of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants was partly restored . during characterization of the mutant phenotypes we noted that the apparent functional connection between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is reflected also by aberrant trichomes . the _PROTEIN_ mutant has a distinct trichome phenotype with two branches whereas wild type trichomes generally have three branches . the _PROTEIN_ plants commonly showed trichomes with three or four branches whereas the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant revealed an additive malformation displaying branchless trichomes of severely reduced cell size . whereas diaminobenzidine staining showed increased accumulation of hydrogen peroxide particularly in the oldest leaves of _PROTEIN_ no distinct dab staining was observed in _PROTEIN_ or the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . furthermore after long term growth under high light none of the plants revealed distinct accumulation . the differential ros accumulation in the different mutant backgrounds prompted us to use the methyl viologen test to examine the sensitivity of visually healthy _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants to photooxidative stress . mv extracts electrons from psi and then reacts with molecular oxygen to produce superoxide and subsequently in chloroplasts . plants were sprayed with mv illuminated under moderate growth light for h and analyzed for the extent of ion leakage . clearly cell death in _PROTEIN_ plants was accelerated by mv treatment as compared with wild type plants . in contrast neither _PROTEIN_ nor the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant showed any enhanced sensitivity to mv induced photooxidative stress . disease resistance is generally connected with increased levels of sa and ja in leaves . parallel analysis of wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants revealed increased levels of sa and to a lesser extent also ja in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants . notably _PROTEIN_ plants revealed no changes in hormone levels as compared with wild type plants . to investigate the proteomic profile of _PROTEIN_ leaves oligomeric protein complexes in total soluble leaf extracts of _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants were separated by clear native _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ followed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the second dimension . for sensitive visualization of spot intensities gels were first stained with sypro ruby and thereafter silver stained for identification of spots of interest by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . imaging of sypro stained two dimensional gels revealed proteins with consistently higher abundance in _PROTEIN_ soluble leaf extracts as compared with wild type plants . these proteins were assigned to different functional groups including defense and stress amino acid metabolism met salvage pathway and the nonoxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway . the identified defense and stress related proteins included myrosinase thioglucoside _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ anhydrase _PROTEIN_ glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ and the chloroplastic copper/zinc superoxide dismutase _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ catalyzes the release of toxic compounds from _PROTEIN_ upon biotic _PROTEIN_ whereas _PROTEIN_ was identified in a screen for sa binding proteins and is connected with the onset of hypersensitive cell death in tobacco . _PROTEIN_ on the other hand is rapidly induced by different stimuli including mv sa et and pathogen attack and _PROTEIN_ is a key scavenger of in the chloroplast . however also among the metabolic enzymes up regulated in _PROTEIN_ cytoplasmic gln synthase and chloroplastic transketolase _PROTEIN_ contribute to defense responses and have been shown to increase in abundance in response to pathogen infection . furthermore onset of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ cys biosynthesis enzyme o acetyl ser lyase _PROTEIN_ cellular thiol levels and has a function in the regulation of cell death . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ comigrated on the gels and were identified with high scores from the same spot . thus increase in the steady state level of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ was confirmed by immunoblotting . regulation of _PROTEIN_ function involves the binding of aconitase in the untranslated region of _PROTEIN_ mrna . intriguingly even though aco was not identified through the proteomic approach immunoblotting revealed increased steady state levels of aco in _PROTEIN_ as compared with wild type plants . by contrast the level of fructose bisphosphate aldolase _PROTEIN_ showed no major changes between _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants . two components of the met salvage pathway s adenosyl l homocysteine hydrolase and adenosine kinase _PROTEIN_ were also found increased in abundance in _PROTEIN_ as compared with wild type plants . this result was confirmed by immunoblotting of the gels with anti sahh and anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies . tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis of the protein spots revealed the presence of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in two different oligomeric protein complexes which migrated at different positions on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . it is worth noting that the sahh containing spot originating from the lower mr oligomer also contained calreticulin an _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ resident lectin chaperone . notably however immunoblotting with anti sahh antibody confirmed both the location and the up regulation of sahh in _PROTEIN_ as compared with wild type plants . in the met salvage pathway sahh hydrolyzes s adenosyl l homocysteine the reaction product of transmethylation reactions to adenosine and homocysteine . adenosine in turn becomes phosphorylated by _PROTEIN_ to avoid end product mediated inhibition of sahh . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were found to comigrate with sahh in the lower mr oligomer on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . for the identification of phosphoproteins the acquired _METHOD_ spectra were analyzed by allowing phosphorylation of ser and thr residues as possible modifications in mascot searches against the arabidopsis database . this approach revealed the presence of phosphopeptides in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ phosphoribulokinase gln synthase _PROTEIN_ and ala glyoxylate aminotransferase _PROTEIN_ . to gain insights into possible differences in the pattern of protein phosphorylation between _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gels were subjected to immunoblotting with phospho thr specific antibody . the immunoblot was overlaid with a sypro stained gel and the detected phosphoproteins were identified as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ based on the relative locations of rubisco subunits on the gel and on the presence of phosphopeptides in the _METHOD_ spectra as presented in table ii . the phosphorylation of rubisco large subunit on thr residues has been demonstrated earlier . as shown in figure the immunoreaction with phospho _PROTEIN_ was stronger in _PROTEIN_ than in wild type plants whereas all other phosphoproteins showed similar or reduced levels in _PROTEIN_ as compared with wild type plants . some of the detected phosphoproteins remained unidentified as they were not visible on sypro stained or silver stained gels . finally the up regulation of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ prompted us to utilize one dimensional _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to explore the levels of chloroplastic and cytoplasmic antioxidant enzymes in _PROTEIN_ and wild type leaves . the steady state levels of chloroplastic and cytoplasmic ascorbate peroxidases as well as the chloroplast cys peroxiredoxin and peroxiredoxin e showed no consistent differences between _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants . however the steady state level of peroxiredoxin q was clearly reduced and the level of chloroplastic glutathione peroxidase was also slightly lower in _PROTEIN_ plants . altogether the proteome of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to respond to defense and ros related pathway changes in leaf tissue . next we explored whether the apparent degeneration of cells in _PROTEIN_ leaves and the differential adjustments in levels of antioxidant enzymes were accompanied by light dependent imbalances in ros metabolism . staining with nitroblue tetrazolium showed distinct accumulation of in the oldest leaves of _PROTEIN_ plants under normal growth light conditions whereas in wild type leaves the accumulation of was remote . is rapidly dismutated to . moreover ros production is enhanced under high light a phenomenon that promotes cell death in various lesion mimic mutants . to determine the extent of accumulation upon sudden changes in light conditions in _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants the rosettes were floated on dab and illuminated under low light growth light or high light for h. under low light conditions wild type plants showed hardly any accumulation of but with increasing light intensities the accumulation of was observed as brown precipitate on the leaves . in the oldest leaves of _PROTEIN_ plants distinct accumulation of was detected already under low light conditions and dab staining was further enhanced when the plants were illuminated under growth light . microscopic examination showed intense dab staining of particularly in chloroplasts of distinct mesophyll cells in _PROTEIN_ leaves . under high irradiance however the difference in dab staining between _PROTEIN_ and the wild type started to level off . accordingly a gradual psii photoinhibition of similar extent was measured for both the wild type and _PROTEIN_ upon exposure of plants to of photons at for h . thus _PROTEIN_ does not contribute to the vulnerability of plants upon sudden onset of high irradiance . next it was tested whether the adjustments in defense associated components altered the _PROTEIN_ mutant s response toward different types of plant pathogens . virulent pseudomonas syringae pv tomato was gently syringe infiltrated at colony forming units into the leaves of _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants . during the first d post infection no significant differences in bacterial growth on the leaves of _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants could be observed . five days post infection however fold higher bacterial titers were counted on the leaves of wild type plants than on the leaves of _PROTEIN_ plants . to assess the ability of _PROTEIN_ plants to resist a necrotrophic fungus lesion formation upon infection by botrytis cinerea was compared with that in the wild type . two days post infection visually observable macerated lesions appeared on wild type leaves . by contrast _PROTEIN_ mutant plants clearly developed less necrotic _METHOD_ . thus in accordance with the constitutive _PROTEIN_ of defense related genes _PROTEIN_ mutant plants show increased resistance to both a hemibiotrophic and a necrotrophic pathogen . bacterial infections have been shown to induce changes in the pattern of dna methylation in plants . furthermore _PROTEIN_ which showed elevated levels in _PROTEIN_ leaves has also been identified as homology _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ and proposed to mediate epigenetic regulation through the _PROTEIN_ of cellular transmethylation capacity . thus we explored whether the knockdown of _PROTEIN_ modulates the level of dna methylation in leaves . to this end dna was digested with methylation sensitive restriction enzymes which cut unmethylated ccgg sites on dna and the global level of dna methylation was explored by southern blotting using the repetitive unit of rdna as a probe . as shown in figure an increased appearance of restriction products indicative of slight hypomethylation was observed in dna isolated from _PROTEIN_ leaves . similar accumulation of dna restriction products was observed with dna isolated from the yellowing plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in contrast the level of dna methylation in the complemented _PROTEIN_ line _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ coding sequence under the promoter was comparable to that of wild type plants .

//signal.salk.edu . the _PROTEIN_ mutant was obtained through the nottingham arabidopsis stock centre . a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant was constructed by crossing the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutants . mutants homozygous for _PROTEIN_ were first selected from the generation based on the absence of trichomes on leaves and individuals homozygous for _PROTEIN_ were further identified by pcr using the same set of primers that were used to screen for the single _PROTEIN_ mutants . for genetic complementation of the _PROTEIN_ mutation the protein coding sequence of the _PROTEIN_ gene was cloned into the binary plant _PROTEIN_ vector under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . for spatial analysis of _PROTEIN_ promoter activity wild type arabidopsis plants were

of yellowing were fixed with glutaraldehyde in mm sodium cacodylate buffer ph under mild vacuum for min and postfixed with osmium tetraoxide in the same buffer . the tissues were then dehydrated in a graded series of acetone and stained with uranyl acetate in acetone . the samples were embedded in spurr s resin polymerized at poststained with lead citrate and finally examined with an electron microscope . degrading chloroplasts that showed loosening of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and roundish or irregular morphology were calculated from eight different images for each cell type . _METHOD_
