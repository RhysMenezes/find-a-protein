the aim of this work was to understand the initial steps of starch breakdown inside chloroplasts . in the non living endosperm of germinating cereal grains starch breakdown is initiated by amylase secreted from surrounding cells . however loss of amylase from arabidopsis does not prevent chloroplastic starch breakdown j. biol . chem . implying that other enzymes must attack the starch granule . here we present evidence that the debranching enzyme isoamylase _PROTEIN_ acts at the surface of the starch granule . _PROTEIN_ mutants have more leaf starch and a slower rate of starch breakdown than wild type plants . the amylopectin of _PROTEIN_ contains many very short branches and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localizes to granule like structures inside chloroplasts . we suggest that _PROTEIN_ removes short branches from the granule surface . to understand how some starch is still degraded in _PROTEIN_ mutants we eliminated a second debranching enzyme limit dextrinase . _PROTEIN_ mutants are indistinguishable from the wild type . however the _PROTEIN_ double mutant has a more severe starch excess phenotype and a slower rate of starch breakdown than _PROTEIN_ single mutants . the double mutant accumulates soluble branched oligosaccharides that are undetectable in the wild type and the single mutants . together these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ debranching occurs primarily at the granule surface via _PROTEIN_ but in its absence soluble branched _PROTEIN_ are debranched in the stroma via limit dextrinase . consistent with this model chloroplastic amylase _PROTEIN_ which could release soluble branched _PROTEIN_ is induced in _PROTEIN_ and in the _PROTEIN_ double mutant .
identification of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ identified mutant alleles of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from publicly available populations . mutants lacking _PROTEIN_ were obtained from the salk collection and from the cold spring harbor gene trap collection _PROTEIN_ and designated _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . the positions of the t dna insertion in _PROTEIN_ and the transposon insertion in _PROTEIN_ were confirmed by pcr and dna sequencing and plants homozygous for the insertions isolated . the effect of the insertions on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was determined using native _PROTEIN_ of crude extracts in gels containing red pullulan _PROTEIN_ . a single band of activity was detected in the two wild type lines . in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ no activity was detectable . mutants lacking _PROTEIN_ were identified from the gabi kat collection and via the arabidopsis tilling program and designated _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . the t dna insertion site in and the point mutation in were confirmed by pcr and dna sequencing . in the ethane methyl sulfonate induced point mutation lies on a splice junction . plants homozygous for each of the mutations were isolated from segregating populations obtained from the source laboratories . to confirm that these mutations abolished _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene we acquired an antiserum raised to an _PROTEIN_ specific peptide and used it to probe protein gel blots of crude extracts from the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ mutants . a single kda protein was detected in the wild type which was missing in both mutants . both alleles of _PROTEIN_ had similar phenotypes . likewise both _PROTEIN_ mutants were alike . unless specified further work was carried out with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ both of which are mutants of the columbia ecotype . we generated a double mutant by crossing _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the double mutant was selected from the segregating population by screening for the t dna insertions in the respective genes using pcr . determination of debranching enzyme enzyme activity is frequently determined using semiquantitative native _PROTEIN_ methods that rely on the debranching of a _PROTEIN_ substrate incorporated into the gel . activity is visualized by staining the gel with an iodine solution and the _PROTEIN_ isoamylase and _PROTEIN_ activity are readily detected in arabidopsis leaf extracts as clear or pale blue bands . no band of debranching enzyme activity has previously been attributed to _PROTEIN_ activity leading to the suggestion that the protein is unstable . we tested a range of native gel conditions and substrates and observed that in gels containing limit dextrin _PROTEIN_ a dark blue band of activity was visible in wild type extracts but missing in _PROTEIN_ extracts . this is consistent with the observation that the _PROTEIN_ orthologue from potato has high activity on limit dextrin in vitro . we developed an assay to quantify limit dextrin debranching activity in extracts of arabidopsis leaves . the assay uses limit dextrin in a saturating background of amylase . the external branches of limit dextrin are a mixture of stubs with degrees of polymerization of and . branches removed by debranching enzyme activity expose linear chains that are immediately degraded to maltose by amylase thereby regenerating the limit dextrin substrate . the product of the assay is predominantly maltose together with smaller amounts of maltotriose . we quantified both using hpaec _PROTEIN_ . using wild type extracts we confirmed that this assay yields linear activity rates for both maltose and maltotriose production with respect to time and the volume of extract added in the ranges used in our experiments . application of the debranching enzyme assay to extracts of wild type and mutant plants showed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ both have reduced limit dextrin debranching activity . the production of maltose was reduced by and relative to the wild type in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively and by in extracts of the double mutant . interestingly the changes in maltotriose production did not follow the changes in maltose production . _PROTEIN_ extracts released slightly less maltotriose than wild type extracts whereas a large reduction was seen with _PROTEIN_ extracts . in the double mutant extracts almost no maltotriose was produced . a second experiment with a separate batch of plants yielded very similar data . thus both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have appreciable activity on limit dextrin but _PROTEIN_ may have a greater affinity than _PROTEIN_ for stubs . we also used this assay to measure the activity in the _PROTEIN_ double mutant . no reduction in activity was seen in _METHOD_ of maltose or maltotriose production . this is intriguing as the activity is visible on a native gel containing the same substrate . one explanation is that the _PROTEIN_ does not remove the and stubs but rather the longer branches that carry stubs . this would result in very little and release . it should be noted that amylase may interfere with this assay as endoamylolysis will also expose chains for amylase . this may account for the residual maltose production in the _PROTEIN_ double mutant . the absence of maltotriose produced in this line is also consistent with this explanation as amylase will release maltose from a branched substrate but not maltotriose . phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the double a controlled environment chamber with a h photoperiod wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants grew at the same rate whereas _PROTEIN_ mutants grew more slowly . the growth of the double mutant was even slower . based on measurements at a single time point it has been reported that an _PROTEIN_ mutant had a higher starch content than the wild type but that an _PROTEIN_ mutant did not . we confirmed these phenotypes and extended the analysis to examine the diurnal turnover of starch . wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants had similar starch contents throughout the diurnal cycle . this result was reproducible in three separate experiments and true for both _PROTEIN_ mutant lines . this result contrasts with the situation in maize leaves in which the starch content was elevated in a mutant that lacks _PROTEIN_ . the starch content of _PROTEIN_ leaves was higher than that of wild type leaves throughout the diurnal cycle supporting earlier suggestions of a role in starch degradation . old leaves contained more starch than young leaves . however appreciable amounts of starch were still degraded during the night and extending the night for a further h led to almost all the starch being remobilized . these data suggest that the loss of _PROTEIN_ impairs but does not prevent the process of starch breakdown and that in a day/night growth regime starch accumulates in small increments due to an imbalance between daytime synthesis and nighttime degradation . to investigate how the starch is still degraded in the absence of _PROTEIN_ we analyzed the _PROTEIN_ double mutant . the phenotype of the double mutant was much more severe . starch accumulated to higher levels than in _PROTEIN_ and the extent of starch breakdown was further reduced and even after an extended night of h all but the youngest leaves still stained darkly for starch with iodine solution . this suggests that in the absence of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plays an important role in debranching _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ present in the soluble fraction of the leaf extracts were also determined . the soluble _PROTEIN_ content in the wild type and the two single mutant plants was very low whereas significant amounts were detectable in the double mutant throughout the diurnal cycle . soluble _PROTEIN_ in the double mutant increased during the night and _PROTEIN_ during the day . these _PROTEIN_ could not be precipitated using methanol kcl indicating low molecular weight oligosaccharides rather than glycogen type structures . to gain more information about the nature of these oligosaccharides we isolated the neutral compounds from the soluble extracts and analyzed them by hpaec _PROTEIN_ . the major oligosaccharide peaks in the chromatogram indicated a size range between and but the peaks did not co elute with linear malto oligosaccharide standards . this is typical of branched oligosaccharides that elute slightly earlier than linear molecules of the same size . to evaluate this further we treated the neutral fraction with a bacterial isoamylase a bacterial pullulanase or both . these treatments changed the appearance of the chromatogram . in all cases linear malto oligosaccharides were liberated including many chains as short as . the overall size range of the oligosaccharides was reduced . using isoamylase alone resulted in a mixture of linear and branched molecules whereas pullulanase or both enzymes together effectively converted all the oligosaccharides to linear molecules _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . these results indicate that in the absence of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ branched oligosaccharides are released from the granule surface and metabolized to limit dextrins that are then inefficiently debranched . increased chloroplastic amylase in _PROTEIN_ and the double oligosaccharides could be released from the granule by the action of amylase . although elimination of the chloroplastic amylase does not result in elevated starch content under our growth conditions it may still contribute to breakdown . our native gels suggested an increased activity of an endoamylase migrating in the same location as the chloroplastic amylase _PROTEIN_ . therefore we performed quantitative amylase measurements on crude extracts of leaves . this revealed a significant increase in amylase activity in _PROTEIN_ and an even greater increase in the _PROTEIN_ double mutant . protein gel blots probed with an antibody raised to the _PROTEIN_ protein confirmed that the amount of _PROTEIN_ protein was increased in both lines . this suggests that the loss of _PROTEIN_ results in a pleiotropic increase in _PROTEIN_ which is increased further in the double mutant line . we performed further native gels to search for additional pleiotropic effects on starch biosynthetic enzymes and degradative enzymes _PROTEIN_ but no other differences were observed . changes in amylopectin structure in _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ double was extracted from leaves harvested at the end of the day and the chain length distribution of the amylopectin was determined by hpaec _PROTEIN_ . the distributions of wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant amylopectins were indistinguishable . in contrast the chain length profile of amylopectin from _PROTEIN_ differed markedly from that of the wild type with an increase in the relative frequency of chains of and to a lesser degree and . chains between and were _PROTEIN_ in relative abundance . the chain length profile of the amylopectin from the _PROTEIN_ double mutant was very similar to that of _PROTEIN_ . in each case the amylopectin chain length profiles were consistent between at least three different batches of plants . chains of amylopectin shorter than are not thought to be produced during normal starch biosynthesis in arabidopsis leaves . consequently the short chains in _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ double mutant most likely result from the action of degradative enzymes . ritte et al . showed that starch granules isolated from potato leaves at night have more short chains on their surface compared with granules isolated from illuminated leaves . the inefficient removal of short chains from the granule surface coupled with the repetitive diurnal cycles of synthesis and degradation could result in the build up of short chains within the granule to the levels that we observe . _PROTEIN_ localizes to the surface of the starch change in amylopectin structure in _PROTEIN_ suggests that _PROTEIN_ could directly attack the starch granule in vivo as well as in vitro . to investigate this further we examined the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein in protoplasts . confocal microscopy of transformed wild type cells revealed _METHOD_ _METHOD_ from within the chloroplasts . however the signal was not uniformly distributed but was strongest from oval structures within the chloroplasts that were similar in size number and distribution to starch granules . this pattern of _METHOD_ was observed in several independent transformation experiments . in most cases the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ surrounded the oval structures from the middle of which there was no chlorophyll _METHOD_ . this is consistent with the presence of a starch granule which would displace the chlorophyll containing _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . we _PROTEIN_ the same construct in protoplasts isolated from the starchless mutant pgm . in this case the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signal was also exclusively from the chloroplast but the signal was uniform . these results provide evidence that _PROTEIN_ is present at the surface of the starch granule .

blots of crude extracts and developed using sigma or immun alkaline phosphatase reagents . enzyme method was developed for the quantitative assays of debranching enzyme using limit dextrin substrate .

was omitted . control reactions were used for each extract and gave very low values which were subtracted from the assay values . for the assay of amylase the kit was used . this employs a linear substrate and is not liable to interference from debranching enzymes . _PROTEIN_ measurements and structural were harvested into liquid and extracted using perchloric acid . total _PROTEIN_ in soluble
