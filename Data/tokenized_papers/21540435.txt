_PROTEIN_ acts as an _LOCATION_ signal molecule in plants . however the nature of the _METHOD_ that export this compound into the apoplast are under debate . we identified the protein pm _PROTEIN_ as a candidate transporter able to mediate _PROTEIN_ export . pm _PROTEIN_ joins the mitochondrial carrier family lacks an n terminal amino acid extension required for organelle localization and locates to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . recombinant pm _PROTEIN_ transports _PROTEIN_ and the gene is substantially _PROTEIN_ in mature pollen grains . artificial microrna mutants show reduced silique length and less seeds per silique but increased seed weight associated with unchanged pollen viability . anthers from amirna mutants exhibited a normal early development but stomium breakage is inhibited leading to impaired anther dehiscence . this results in reduced self pollination and thus _PROTEIN_ fertilization efficiency . amirna pollen grains showed increased intracellular _PROTEIN_ levels but _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ levels . the latter effects are in line with transport properties of recombinant pm _PROTEIN_ supporting in planta that functional pm _PROTEIN_ resides in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and concur with the pm _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pattern . we assume that pm _PROTEIN_ contributes to _PROTEIN_ export during pollen maturation . _PROTEIN_ export may serve as an _LOCATION_ signal required for anther dehiscence and is a novel _PROTEIN_ critical for pollination and autogamy .
the arabidopsis genome encodes predicted mcf type carrier proteins and a phylogenetic analysis classified pm _PROTEIN_ as a member of the mcf forming a monophyletic subcluster with the three mitochondrial adp/atp carriers _PROTEIN_ . within this subcluster pm _PROTEIN_ shows highest structural identity with the _LOCATION_ located _PROTEIN_ carrier _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ followed by the mitochondrial protein _PROTEIN_ . the sequence of pm _PROTEIN_ consists of amino acids exhibiting three tandem repeats of residues and six predicted transmembrane helices . both the presence of three tandem repeats and three conserved mitochondrial energy transfer signatures in pm _PROTEIN_ are characteristic features of all mcf type carriers . similar to the _LOCATION_ located _PROTEIN_ carrier _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ but in contrast with the mitochondrial proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ pm _PROTEIN_ does not possess a putative n terminal transit peptide . however such sequence extension in plant aac proteins is strictly required for targeting to the inner mitochondrial _LOCATION_ . a comprehensive study of amino acids essential for the function of mitochondrial aacs suggests a putative biochemical function for pm _PROTEIN_ as an _PROTEIN_ transporter . for example the presence of a so called nucleotide carrier signature consisting of the amino acid sequence rrrmmm is a unique signature for all mcf type _PROTEIN_ carriers like _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and is also present in pm _PROTEIN_ with the first met replaced by the structurally related ile residue . however the three arg residues in the nucleotide carrier signature are only part of in total six arg residues found to be crucial for the adp/atp transport activity of the yeast _PROTEIN_ protein . furthermore the structure of the bovine _PROTEIN_ monomer was solved at a resolution of by x ray crystallography . several clusters of charged amino acids were identified as being potentially involved in substrate binding and therefore are fundamental for the function of mitochondrial aacs . in the translocation channel of bovine _PROTEIN_ a cationic cluster consisting of two lys and six arg residues directed to the substrate was identified . the positions of their side chains were stabilized by an intricate hydrogen bond network and electrostatic interactions involving water molecules and acidic or _PROTEIN_ side chains of glu asp asp gln glu and asn . most of these important charged or _PROTEIN_ amino acids are conserved in pm _PROTEIN_ namely lys arg arg arg arg arg and arg and glu asp asp gln glu and asn but the basic amino acid lys is replaced by the basic amino acid his . in summary the high conservation of amino acid residues critical for the function of mitochondrial aacs indicates a function for pm _PROTEIN_ as an adenylate transport protein . we tried to synthesize recombinant pm _PROTEIN_ in yeast or xenopus laevis oocytes . after _PROTEIN_ of pm _PROTEIN_ constructs the corresponding cells were incubated for different periods of time in radioactively labeled _PROTEIN_ but no net uptake above the background was detectable . however it has frequently been shown that heterologous synthesis of other nucleotide transporters _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lead to their functional integration into the bacterial cytoplasmic _LOCATION_ with transport properties similar to those obtained across the authentic _LOCATION_ . heterologous synthesis of pm _PROTEIN_ in e. coli also results in the integration of this carrier into the bacterial _LOCATION_ because after isopropyl d thiogalactopyranoside induction a substantial fraction of the recombinantly synthesized pm _PROTEIN_ migrated according to the calculated molecular _METHOD_ of kd . uptake studies with radioactively labeled _PROTEIN_ or adp into intact bacterial cells harboring pm _PROTEIN_ revealed the time linear import of both nucleotides for min whereas by contrast noninduced e. coli cells hardly imported adenylates . the import of radioactively labeled _PROTEIN_ or adp by recombinant pm _PROTEIN_ into e. coli cells displayed typical michaelis menten kinetics with apparent km values of for _PROTEIN_ and for adp . competition experiments with different potential substrates showed that pm _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ inhibited by purine and pyrimidine trinuceotides but not by nicotine amid dinucleotides or nucleotide sugar derivatives . the uncoupler compound cccp does not inhibit _PROTEIN_ uptake by pm _PROTEIN_ indicating that transport is not energized by a proton motif force . effects of various metabolites on _PROTEIN_ transport by pm _PROTEIN_ the subcellular localization of pm _PROTEIN_ was not predictable by the computer _METHOD_ targetp and signalp . moreover the lack of any putative _LOCATION_ or mitochondrial transit peptide was confirmed by the use of the _METHOD_ chlorop and mitoprot . we investigated the subcellular localization of pm _PROTEIN_ in planta by the generation of a pm _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion and transient _PROTEIN_ in intact tobacco protoplasts _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . after _PROTEIN_ of the constructed pm _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ gene a _METHOD_ signal could be detected at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . this conclusion about the subcellular localization is supported by the corresponding chloroplast _METHOD_ the merged image and the colocalization of pm _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ bound aquaporin fusion protein _PROTEIN_ mcherry . to study pm _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ in planta we analyzed independent pm _PROTEIN_ promoter gus _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis lines for reporter gene activity . thirteen of these lines showed a very similar _PROTEIN_ pattern varying only slightly in the intensity of gus staining . in flowers pm _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ visible in anther tissue and the style . pollen grains located on the stigma also show high pm _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and young leaf veins and the central cylinder from developing roots are also characterized for high pm _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . relative pm _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ does not change during leaf development and corresponding mrna accumulation in roots is due to _PROTEIN_ in proto and meta phloem . a closer examination of gus staining in developing anthers revealed that this staining is in _PROTEIN_ due to substantial pm _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in pollen grains located inside the closed anther . in siliques harboring developing seeds pm _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ reached high levels and _PROTEIN_ to the lower sensitivity level during maturation of this organ . pm _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ during pollen maturation was extracted from microarray experiments . in unicellular pollen relative pm _PROTEIN_ transcription reached a value of and increased constantly during microgametogenesis . in mature pollen grains pm _PROTEIN_ transcript was about fourfold above the level present at the beginning of pollen development . to obtain insight into the physiological impact of pm _PROTEIN_ we intended to make use of transgenic plants . two independent heterozygous pm _PROTEIN_ t dna arabidopsis mutants carrying a t dna insertion either at the very end of the sole exon or at the beginning of the untranslated region respectively were provided by the salk library . after backcrossing homozygous t dna lines were identified by pcr of genomic dna however quantitative rt pcr using pm _PROTEIN_ specific primers exhibited an unchanged pm _PROTEIN_ transcript level in these mutants . thus we decided to construct artificial microrna mutant lines . selection of suitable dna sequences was conducted according to citation and http . after transfer into the genome of wild type plants we were able to identify various independent amirna pm _PROTEIN_ lines most of them showed pm _PROTEIN_ mrna levels similar to wild type plants . however by testing the pm _PROTEIN_ transcript level in independent mutants we were able to identify among others the strong amirna pm _PROTEIN_ pm _PROTEIN_ lines and . in these mutant lines the pm _PROTEIN_ mrna levels are reduced to in line and to in line of wild type levels . to exclude unspecific effects on pollen grains due to the knockdown approach per se we included amirna pm _PROTEIN_ line in our investigations . the latter mutant showed mrna levels similar to wild type plants and is thus expected to behave similarly . after growing for weeks in the climate controlled growth chambers a phenotypic difference between the strong amirna pm _PROTEIN_ lines and and the wild type line was obvious . both mutant lines showed significantly reduced numbers of fully developed siliques whereas mutant line exhibited silique development similar to wild type plants . the distorted silique development in mutant lines and correlated with _PROTEIN_ numbers of fully developed seeds whereas the control amirna pm _PROTEIN_ line and wild type plants exhibited unaltered numbers of seeds per silique . measurements of the average silique lengths allowed quantification of differences between wild type and mutant lines . wild type plants and mutant line showed average silique lengths of mm whereas amirna pm _PROTEIN_ lines and exhibited average silique lengths of only and mm respectively . similarly the average number of seeds per silique was similar in the wild type and weak amirna pm _PROTEIN_ line whereas amirna pm _PROTEIN_ lines and exhibited significantly _PROTEIN_ seed numbers per silique ranging from seeds per silique in line to seeds per silique in line . remarkably the average seed weight appeared to be reciprocal to the number of seeds per silique . both the wild type and amirna pm _PROTEIN_ line showed a seed weight of mg whereas that of mutant line was mg and that of mutant line was mg . the observation that amirna pm _PROTEIN_ lines exhibited fewer seeds per silique might indicate that mutant plants exhibit impaired male or female fertility . to control pollen fitness we pollinated wild type stigma with pollen grains from heterozygous mutant lines or . to test female gametophytic fertility we pollinated the stigma from both heterozygous mutant lines with wild type pollen grains . as controls we allowed self fertilization of the two heterozygous amirna pm _PROTEIN_ lines and . genetic transmission efficiency was subsequently quantified by analyzing kanamycin resistance of successor seedlings which is expected to cosegregate with amirna pm _PROTEIN_ . transfer of pollen from heterozygous mutant lines and to wild type stigma led to and kanamycin resistant seedlings respectively and and kanamycin sensitive seedlings . these numbers lead to and respectively antibiotic resistant plants and can be taken as an indication that pollen fitness of amirna pm _PROTEIN_ lines and is unaltered when compared with the wild type . alternatively pollination of a wild type pistil with pollen derived from heterozygous mutant lines and led to and kanamycin resistant seedlings respectively and and kanamycin sensitive seedlings . the corresponding ratios are and which also indicate intactness of the female gametophyte . control pollination by self fertilization leads in both mutant lines to of kanamycin resistant seedlings which is fully in line with the conclusion that both male and female gametophytes did not show altered properties when compared with the wild type . _LOCATION_ phenotypes and pollen morphology were further analyzed by diamidino phenylindole and alexander staining . dapi staining revealed that pollen from all plant lines possess a larger diffusely stained vegetative _LOCATION_ and two stained sperm cell _LOCATION_ . similarly the morphology of wild type and mutant pollen is identical as revealed by alexander staining . to identify the origin of the _PROTEIN_ pollination efficiency observed in amirna pm _PROTEIN_ lines and we analyzed the presence of pollen tubes in fully mature pistil tissues from wild type and mutant lines . interestingly pistils from wild type and mutant line are characterized by the presence of many pollen tubes as visualized by bright pollen tube staining with aniline blue . by contrast pistils from mutant lines and showed substantially reduced numbers of pollen tubes . in the style of mutant line pollen tubes were not visible and in the style from mutant line only four to five individual pollen tubes were apparent . the _PROTEIN_ that pm _PROTEIN_ is highly _PROTEIN_ in mature pollen grains and the reduced silique development in amirna pm _PROTEIN_ mutants provoked us to analyze the morphology of the corresponding flowers in more detail . flowers from both the wild type and the three amirna pm _PROTEIN_ lines developed with the same velocity leading after weeks to fully opened organs possessing all structures required for pollination . however a closer look at the anther morphology revealed that amirna pm _PROTEIN_ lines and exhibited impaired anther opening whereas anthers from the wild type and line were fully opened and decorated with pollen grains . to determine whether impaired dehiscence was caused by a morphological abnormality of the anthers we analyzed transverse sections of the representative mutant line and wild type anthers . about d before flower opening anthers from both the wild type and mutant line were closed and harbored nearly fully developed pollen grains . furthermore other cell structures associated with the anther such as epidermis endothecium tapetum stomium and connective and vascular bundles appeared to be normally developed . however during progression of growth wild type anthers dehisced at the stomium and expelled the previously embedded pollen grains whereas anthers from amirna pm _PROTEIN_ line did not dehisce and thus did not provide the functional intact pollen grains at the anther surface while the stigma was receptive for pollination . as demonstrated above pm _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ resides in the plant _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ the corresponding gene is substantially _PROTEIN_ in pollen grains and the carrier transports _PROTEIN_ after recombinant synthesis in e. coli . thus we tested whether pollen grains enriched from the wild type or amirna pm _PROTEIN_ lines showed altered internal and external _PROTEIN_ levels . for this we isolated pollen grains from the corresponding anthers suspended them in germination medium and quantified _PROTEIN_ in intact pollen grains and after exportation into the medium via luciferase/luciferin induced luminescence . pollen grains from the wild type and amirna pm _PROTEIN_ line contained similar _PROTEIN_ levels approaching protein . by contrast pollen cells from amirna pm _PROTEIN_ lines and contained significantly increased internal _PROTEIN_ levels namely pmol _PROTEIN_ protein in pollen from mutant line and pmol _PROTEIN_ protein in pollen from mutant line . wild type and mutant line exported _PROTEIN_ at similar rates approaching pmol _PROTEIN_ protein in min . interestingly although the internal _PROTEIN_ concentration in pollen cells from mutant lines and was higher than in wild type pollen the rates of _PROTEIN_ export into the germination medium were substantially _PROTEIN_ when compared with wild type and mutant line pollen cells . pollen from mutant line exported pmol _PROTEIN_ protein within min of incubation and pollen from mutant line exported only pmol _PROTEIN_ protein .
