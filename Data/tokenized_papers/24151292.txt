all cells produce reactive oxygen species as by products of their metabolism . in addition to being cytotoxic ros act as regulators of a wide range of developmental and physiological processes . little is known about the molecular _METHOD_ underlying the perception of ros and initiation of cellular responses in eukaryotes . using the unicellular green alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii we developed a genetic screen for early components of singlet oxygen signaling . here we report the identification of a small zinc finger protein methylene blue _PROTEIN_ that is required for induction of singlet oxygen dependent gene _PROTEIN_ and upon oxidative stress accumulates in distinct granules in the _LOCATION_ . loss of function mbs mutants produce singlet oxygen but are unable to fully respond to it at the level of gene _PROTEIN_ . knockout or knockdown of the homologous genes in the higher plant model arabidopsis thaliana results in mutants that are hypersensitive to photooxidative stress whereas overexpression produces plants with elevated stress tolerance . together our data indicate an important and evolutionarily conserved role of the mbs protein in ros signaling and provide a strategy for engineering stress tolerant plants .
we previously reported that a codon optimized version of the luciferase gene from the copepod gaussia princeps provides a sensitive reporter of gene _PROTEIN_ in the unicellular model alga c. reinhardtii . the availability of a sensitive reporter gene has opened up the possibility to exploit the convenience of c. reinhardtii genetics for the isolation of regulators of gene _PROTEIN_ by forward genetics . this provides a particularly attractive alternative to higher plant models where complex multicellular organization makes mutant screens difficult or impossible . light stress induced ros signaling is a case in point because the primary responses are largely confined to photosynthetically active tissues and therefore affect only a small number of the many cell types present in higher plants . we used the codon optimized g. princeps luciferase gene in combination with the responsive promoter to set up a genetic screen for mutants defective in sensing and/or signaling . to this end an algal strain harboring the driven reporter cassette was subjected to large scale insertional mutagenesis based on random insertion of a hygromycin resistance gene cassette . a total of insertion mutants were generated by transformation and screened for their inability to induce luciferase _PROTEIN_ in response to stress . stress was applied by exposure of algal cultures to methylene blue a photosensitizer that is readily taken up by c. reinhardtii cells and triggers the production of in the light . seventeen mutants were identified that lacked luciferase induction upon application of stress . to distinguish between mutants that are specifically defective in their response to and mutants with general defects in _PROTEIN_ of the luciferase reporter heat stress experiments were performed . the _PROTEIN_ promoter driving the luciferase reporter is not only responsive to but it is also strongly inducible by heat shock . as the heat response is genetically distinct from the response to any mutant specifically affected in responses should still show wild type like luciferase induction by heat . this was the case for of the algal mutants identified in the mb screen suggesting that these mutants are neither generally affected in luciferase _PROTEIN_ nor generally defective in their response to abiotic stresses . the algal mutants for the genetic screen were generated by insertional mutagenesis to facilitate identification of the mutated gene based on tagging with the selectable marker gene cassette . however previous work has shown that only of the mutations are tagged by the transforming dna . moreover the integration of transforming dna into the c. reinhardtii _LOCATION_ genome is often accompanied by larger deletions at the site of insertion thus additionally complicating gene identification . when isolation of flanking sequences by inverse pcr was attempted for four of the mutants that proved to be specific only one of the mutants turned out to be tagged and was devoid of a genomic deletion accompanying marker insertion . the mutant harbored a single copy insertion of the hygromycin resistance cassette in the putative promoter region of a small gene of unknown function . the gene subsequently referred to as mbs is interrupted by three introns as revealed by comparison of the genomic sequence with a full length clone in the _PROTEIN_ sequence tag database and further confirmed by rt pcr and dna sequencing . rt pcr assays also indicated that the insertion of the hygromycin cassette into the promoter completely abolishes mbs _PROTEIN_ in the isolated mbs mutant suggesting that the mutant represents a null allele . to confirm that the tagged locus is indeed responsible for the mutant phenotype the mutant strain was complemented by genetic transformation with a cdna _PROTEIN_ construct . the resulting transgenic strains _PROTEIN_ showed wild type like tolerance to mb under conditions where the mbs mutant died presumably due to lethal photooxidative damage . the putative mbs protein is a small protein of kd . it has homologs in all lineages of land plants . while it is encoded by a single copy _LOCATION_ gene in c. reinhardtii and rice two copies are found in the arabidopsis genome and three copies in the genome of the model moss physcomitrella patens . the only salient feature identifiable upon bioinformatics analysis of the amino acid sequence was a single zinc finger motif of the _PROTEIN_ type . to assess the possible involvement of the mbs homologs in sensing and/or signaling in embryophytes we sought to isolate mutants of the two genes in arabidopsis tentatively named _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . neither of the two genes displays a pronounced tissue specific or developmental stage specific _PROTEIN_ pattern with the exception of a moderate upregulation of during senescence a condition known to involve substantial production of ros . searches of the collections of t dna tagged arabidopsis lines revealed three candidate mutants two of them harboring insertions upstream of and one carrying a t dna insertion upstream of . sequencing of the insertion sites confirmed the location of the t dna inserts . to determine the effects of the t dna insertions on mbs _PROTEIN_ homozygous mutant lines were isolated and analyzed by nonquantitative rt pcr assays . the results revealed that while the mutant showed no detectable _PROTEIN_ and therefore is probably equivalent to a knockout mutant the and mutants had wild type like _PROTEIN_ levels . this finding is consistent with the t dna insertion in the mutant being much closer to the coding region than in the other two mutants . the mutant did not display a discernible phenotype under standard growth conditions . to preliminarily test for involvement of arabidopsis in plant responses to the sensitivity of mutant plants to high light _PROTEIN_ stress was examined a condition known to trigger _METHOD_ production of by psii . indeed mutant plants showed severe _METHOD_ of photooxidative damage under excess light consistent with an involvement of the arabidopsis protein in ros responses . at the rosette stage the phenotype was characterized by early senescence of the older leaves indicative of the accumulation of light induced oxidative damage over time . in the absence of a second independent t dna mutant for complementation of the mutant with an _METHOD_ _METHOD_ fusion gene under the control of the native promoter was attempted . transgenic lines _METHOD_ were initially identified by their _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and subsequently assayed for complementation of the _PROTEIN_ sensitive phenotype . four independently generated lines showed accumulation of the _METHOD_ fusion protein and displayed wild type like tolerance to _PROTEIN_ stress thus proving that the phenotype of the mutant is indeed caused by the t dna insertion and at the same time demonstrating that the _METHOD_ fusion protein is functional . in the absence of both a mutant for and a second independent t dna allele for mutant lines for both genes were produced by rna interference . to this end gene specific tags were inserted into rnai vectors and stably transformed into the arabidopsis genome . for both and rnai lines could be isolated that showed varying amounts of gene specific downregulation of _PROTEIN_ at the mrna level . to generate a double mutant the rnai construct against was transformed into the mutant and homozygous rnai mutants were isolated . they showed lack of detectable _PROTEIN_ and low levels of _PROTEIN_ . while the phenotype of the rnai plants was similar to that of the mutant the double mutants clearly showed a more severe phenotype in that premature leaf senescence occurred already at the early rosette stage . to determine the subcellular localization of the mbs proteins in both c. reinhardtii and arabidopsis gene fusions to yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were constructed and introduced into cells by stable and transient transformation respectively . visualization of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in c. reinhardtii was possible using the recently generated uv mutagenesis _PROTEIN_ strains . the mbs _METHOD_ fusion protein showed a clear _LOCATION_ localization in the transgenic algal strains . similarly the arabidopsis _METHOD_ fusion protein accumulated in the nucleocytosolic compartment of transiently transformed tobacco protoplasts . interestingly the localization pattern changed markedly when the cells were exposed to stress . the previously homogeneous distribution of the _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ was now confined to discrete spots raising the possibility that the perception of involves a pronounced change of protein distribution in the cell . stress related globular structures that are known to form in the _LOCATION_ include stress granules and processing bodies _PROTEIN_ . sgs accumulate under various stress conditions and represent large cytoplasmic aggregates of untranslated mrnas bound to a specific set of proteins . as the mrnas are stored in the form of stalled preinitiation complexes translation initiation _PROTEIN_ such as rna binding _PROTEIN_ can serve as molecular markers for sgs . _PROTEIN_ are stress related cytoplasmic foci that contain enzymes involved in mrna degradation . in plant cells they can be distinguished from sgs using the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ subunit of the mrna decapping complex as marker protein . to test for a possible association of with sgs and/or _PROTEIN_ constructs _PROTEIN_ fusions of the red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ to _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ were employed in cotransformation experiments with the _METHOD_ fusion construct . interestingly _METHOD_ _METHOD_ showed clear overlap with both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ indicating that associates with both sgs and _PROTEIN_ upon stress . light stress dependent accumulation of was also seen in transgenic plants stably _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ fusion protein . to ultimately confirm that protein is associated with _LOCATION_ rna containing granules we enriched these granules from plants _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ fusion protein using a protocol developed for _PROTEIN_ purification . this procedure resulted in the isolation of _METHOD_ bodies that could be readily observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy . treatment with rnase a resulted in loss of the granular _METHOD_ _METHOD_ suggesting that it dissolved the granules or at least released _METHOD_ protein from the granules . if mbs mutants are defective in sensing or signaling they should be incapable of efficient induction of the antioxidative defense system that detoxifies after stress acclimation . to test for such defects imaging of light stressed arabidopsis seedlings was performed by staining leaves with the specific _METHOD_ dye singlet oxygen sensor green . indeed leaves of the mutant showed much more intense staining with sosg than the wild type suggesting that the mutant is deficient in inducing detoxification reactions presumable due to the lack of proper signaling . the effect was specific to in that staining for accumulation with diamino benzidine revealed no significant difference between the wild type and the mutant . to study the effects of overexpression an additional set of transgenic lines was generated _METHOD_ in which the transgene is driven by the strong constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus promoter in the _METHOD_ mutant background . as expected these lines also showed complementation of the mutant phenotype including full restoration of signaling and detoxification reactions in response to light stress . sosg staining was also employed to investigate accumulation at the subcellular level . as a control the arabidopsis flu mutant was included which accumulates the photosensitizer protochlorophyllide in the dark and after a dark to light shift generates _METHOD_ amounts of in the chloroplast . as expected this was seen as intense sosg _METHOD_ upon transfer of mutant plants to the light . by contrast wild type plants did not show significant changes in sosg _METHOD_ even upon transfer to _PROTEIN_ presumably because of the efficient induction of signaling _METHOD_ and detoxification reactions . the mutant however showed strong accumulation of in chloroplasts in response to light stress confirming that the chloroplast is the _PROTEIN_ site of production also in the mutant and providing further evidence for this mutant not properly responding to . extensive work on the flu mutant has shown that under low level photooxidative stress production does not directly cause lethal cellular damage but instead activates a genetic program that ultimately results in cell death seedling lethality and inhibited plant growth . at higher levels of photooxidative stress this genetically controlled response is gradually overridden by the physiological cell death response triggered by toxicity . when the sensitivity of the mutant to photooxidative stress was analyzed in dark light shift experiments it was found to be highly sensitive albeit significantly less sensitive than the flu mutant . light sensitivity of the mutant was further confirmed by measurements of the maximum quantum efficiency of psii fv/fm . upon _PROTEIN_ stress fv/fm declined sharply in the mutant compared with the wild type suggestive of the accumulation of photooxidative damage in psii . altogether these data are consistent with an important role of the mbs protein in triggering appropriate cellular responses to stress . taken together the data on the c. reinhardtii and arabidopsis mutants establish that mbs mutants produce upon photooxidative stress but can not properly induce cellular defense responses . in c. reinhardtii this is also evident at the level of responsive gene _PROTEIN_ . to test whether the arabidopsis mutant is defective in ros responsive gene _PROTEIN_ quantitative real time rt pcr assays were performed for marker genes of oxidative stress . the arabidopsis flu mutant was included as a control because it shows extreme induction of responsive gene _PROTEIN_ due to the _METHOD_ production of after transition from darkness to _PROTEIN_ conditions . analysis of _PROTEIN_ in the wild type and the flu mutant revealed that itself is not inducible at the mrna level by stress . qrt pcr using specific primers for the marker genes aaa _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and toll ir revealed rapid induction of _PROTEIN_ in the flu mutant already h after the shift to _PROTEIN_ stress _PROTEIN_ and moderate induction in the wild type after h . by contrast no increase above the level at time point zero was seen in the _PROTEIN_ of any of the three marker genes in the mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to test whether or not other ros responses are also impaired in the mutant the _PROTEIN_ of two marker genes was analyzed ascorbate _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . both genes showed similar induction behavior upon light stress in the wild type the flu mutant and the mutant indicating that the responses to are largely unaffected . finally two general light stress responsive transcription _PROTEIN_ were investigated _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . their induction by light stress was delayed or less pronounced in the mutant compared with the wild type and the flu mutant possibly due to the lack of the contribution of the signal to the induction . together these data suggest that at the level of gene _PROTEIN_ the mutant does not respond properly to while it shows largely unaffected responses to other ros . using the construct transgenic arabidopsis lines overexpressing the protein were generated . nonquantitative rt pcr analyses indicated that at the mrna level substantial overexpression of the gene could be achieved . to be able to assess _PROTEIN_ at the protein level specific antibodies against the protein were generated . the antibodies recognized the protein with high specificity but were not sensitive enough to detect the protein in wild type plants possibly suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ level is low or protein detection is difficult due to the small size of . however in two overexpression lines the antibodies detected the protein demonstrating that strong overexpression was achieved also at the protein level . the overexpression lines were visually indistinguishable from wild type plants and mutant plants under normal light conditions . however when exposed to _PROTEIN_ stress the overexpression lines showed a much stronger accumulation of the stress protective pigment anthocyanin than the wild type while the mutant showed a pale phenotype and lacked visible accumulation of anthocyanin . it is well established that anthocyanin synthesis is induced upon exposure to _PROTEIN_ but this induction is largely inhibited by overaccumulation of ros . thus the pattern of anthocyanin accumulation in the mbs mutants and overexpression lines _METHOD_ that overaccumulation occurs in the mbs mutants and suggests that light stress responses are induced more efficiently in the overexpression lines . the stronger protective response to _PROTEIN_ stress translates into a pronounced growth advantage of the overexpression lines after transfer back to normal light conditions . high tolerance of the overexpression lines to light stress was further confirmed by measurements of the change in chlorophyll content and in the maximum quantum efficiency of psii during the recovery from _PROTEIN_ stress . the anti antibody also detected the _METHOD_ protein in one of our complemented lines that were transformed with the _METHOD_ construct under the control of the endogenous promoter . this allowed us to determine protein accumulation in response to _PROTEIN_ stress . indeed the protein accumulated to elevated level after transfer from normal light to _PROTEIN_ . as light stress does not significantly alter mrna levels this finding suggests that accumulation is regulated at the translational or posttranslational level . light stress induced _METHOD_ accumulation also explains the strong increase in _METHOD_ _METHOD_ after transfer from the dark to _PROTEIN_ conditions observed in our subcellular localization analyses . assuming that mbs proteins act as components of signaling but do not function as a scavenger of mbs _PROTEIN_ bacterial strains should not show an elevated tolerance to stress as the mbs overexpressing plants do . to confirm this the mbs genes from c. reinhardtii and arabidopsis were _PROTEIN_ under the control of an isopropyl d thiogalactopyranosid inducible promoter in escherichia coli . when the strains were _PROTEIN_ with stress induced by mb treatment no increased tolerance was seen in the stains overexpressing cr mbs or at suggesting that the mbs protein does not act as a scavenger . transcriptome profiling experiments were performed for the following five lines rnai flu and the wild type . plants were stressed by shifting them from a h dark period to _PROTEIN_ for h and compared with unstressed control plants at the end of the h dark period in three biological replicates using affymetrix _PROTEIN_ microarrays . when the numbers of genes in the genome that displayed a more than fourfold significant change h after the onset of light stress were compared the flu mutant showed the strongest change . the number of induced genes was elevated compared with the wild type and the other plant lines investigated consistent with the flu mutant suffering from severe photooxidative stress upon transfer from low light to light stress conditions . to assess the regulation of ros responsive genes we extracted from the microarray data sets all arabidopsis genes that had been reported as specifically responding to or based on previously performed comprehensive transcriptomic studies using the same microarrays _PROTEIN_ . this gave a set of responsive genes _PROTEIN_ and responsive genes . these sets were then analyzed in the five plant lines . as expected the ros responsive gene _PROTEIN_ pattern in the flu mutant differed most strongly from that of the other four lines . the wild type grouped together with the overexpression line and the two mbs mutant lines clustered together . interestingly in the mutant lines the number of marker genes significantly induced by more than fourfold by _PROTEIN_ stress was much lower than in the wild type . whereas responsive genes were upregulated in the wild type only were upregulated in the rnai double mutant supporting the idea that the mbs gene product is required to mediate responses at the level of gene _PROTEIN_ . by contrast the number of responsive genes induced in the mutants was only slightly lower than in the wild type and the line suggesting that these responses are not primarily affected in the mbs mutants . mbs accumulates in the nucleocytosolic compartment . is _PROTEIN_ produced in the chloroplast as a by product of photosynthetic electron transfer . the chloroplast is also an important site where mediated _PROTEIN_ responses occur to scavenge and minimize its production . the latter includes a transcriptional response of the chloroplast genome which encodes many of the key components of the ros producing _METHOD_ especially the reaction center subunits of both _METHOD_ which bind a large number of redox active cofactors . chloroplast photosynthesis genes are _PROTEIN_ transcribed by the _LOCATION_ encoded rna polymerase which resembles bacterial rna polymerases and requires _LOCATION_ encoded sigma _PROTEIN_ for promoter recognition . sigma _PROTEIN_ in turn are regulated by sigma _PROTEIN_ binding proteins . in arabidopsis the sigma _PROTEIN_ binding _PROTEIN_ is rapidly induced by stress and by pathogen attack the response to which also involves ros production and extensive ros mediated signal transduction . our microarray experiments indicated that the transcriptional induction of the _PROTEIN_ gene in response to _PROTEIN_ stress is abrogated in mbs mutants . in view of the key role that _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ sigma _PROTEIN_ play in mediating primary stress responses in chloroplast gene _PROTEIN_ we sought to confirm this finding using an independent method . qrt pcr analyses demonstrated that neither the mutant nor the rnai mutant were capable of inducing the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene in response to _PROTEIN_ stress whereas the overexpression line showed a wild type like response . these data provide further evidence for mbs mutants being impaired in their response to at the level of _LOCATION_ gene _PROTEIN_ and moreover suggest that also the induced remodeling of chloroplast gene _PROTEIN_ is defective in the mutants .
