pharmacological evidence suggests that anion channel mediated _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ anion effluxes are crucial in early defense signaling to induce immune responses and hypersensitive cell death in plants . however their molecular bases and regulation remain largely unknown . we overexpressed arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ an s type anion channel involved in stomatal closure in cultured tobacco by cells and analyzed the effect on cryptogein induced defense responses including fluxes of and other ions production of reactive oxygen species gene _PROTEIN_ and hypersensitive responses . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was localized at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in by cells . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ enhanced cryptogein induced efflux and _LOCATION_ alkalinization as well as rapid/transient and slow/prolonged phases of nadph oxidase mediated ros production which was suppressed by an anion channel inhibitor dids . the overexpressor also showed enhanced sensitivity to cryptogein to induce downstream immune responses including the induction of defense marker genes and the hypersensitive cell death . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in by cells mediates cryptogein induced _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ efflux to positively modulate the elicitor triggered activation of other ion fluxes ros as well as a wide range of defense signaling pathways . these findings shed light on the possible involvement of the slac/slah family anion channels in cryptogein signaling to trigger the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ ion channel cascade in the plant defense signal transduction network .
pharmacological evidence suggests the importance of anion channel mediated anion efflux in cryptogein induced initial responses in cultured tobacco cells . we therefore checked the effect of an anion channel inhibitor dids on cryptogein induced hypersensitive responses in by cells . increasing evidence suggests the involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction in the induction of hypersensitive cell death in plants as well as in animals . mtt reductase activity was monitored as a marker for mitochondrial function . as shown in cryptogein induced a rapid reduction in mtt reductase activity in by

been suggested to correlate with hypersensitive responses . the _PROTEIN_ of was induced h after the application of cryptogein which was strongly reduced by dids . these results suggest that anion channels are involved in the regulation of cryptogein induced hypersensitive responses in by cells . arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ is an s type anion channel located at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in guard cells . to study intracellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ in by cells we introduced the _METHOD_ construct fused to the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ into by protoplasts and examined its intracellular localization by confocal laser scanning microscopy . when _METHOD_ alone was _PROTEIN_ it localized to the _LOCATION_ and the cytoplasm . in contrast the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was specifically targeted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ images of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were clearly different from those of a marker for internal _LOCATION_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ functions at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in by cells as in arabidopsis guard cells . confocal _METHOD_ images of by protoplast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ stained with the _METHOD_ styryl _LOCATION_ probe . _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ and . scale bar . was kept as a mm stock solution in sterile water and used at a final concentration of . tobacco by protoplasts were treated with for min and washed twice with the wash buffer at room temperature to label the pm . to test possible involvement of _PROTEIN_ in the cryptogein induced _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ anion efflux we generated transgenic tobacco by cell lines _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ by means of agrobacterium mediated transformation . several transformant lines were obtained and the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ mrna in by cells was confirmed by rt pcr analyses . finally four transformant lines were selected for further investigation . to confirm if _PROTEIN_ plays a role in anion transport in by cells we tested whether the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ mrna affected anion transport activity . _LOCATION_ concentration was simultaneously monitored with ion selective electrodes in the growth medium . _LOCATION_ showed a prolonged increase after cryptogein application which is consistent with our previous report . as shown in cryptogein induced efflux was significantly higher in the _PROTEIN_ overexpressing cells than

_LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ signaling events . cryptogein induced biphasic slow and prolonged _LOCATION_ alkalinization which is consistent with our previous report . this elicitor induced _LOCATION_

cryptogein triggered ros production is predominantly mediated by nadph oxidases . dids clearly suppressed elicitor induced ros production suggesting that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ leads to enhanced activation of the nadph oxidases . taken together _PROTEIN_ mediated anion efflux is suggested to affect the regulation of nadph oxidase activity . cryptogein induced rapid transient ros production within min in by cells . data is representative of three experiments the effects of inhibitors on cryptogein induced ros production within min . to quantify the effects of inhibitors on ros production

_PROTEIN_ of four independent experiments . p < p < significantly different from the control line . cryptogein induces biphasic ros production in tobacco by cells . _PROTEIN_ of a tobacco nox homolog _PROTEIN_ encoding nadph oxidase is induced in response to cryptogein/elicitors or avirulent pathogens and is suggested to be essential for the slow and prolonged ros production . as shown in the time course of cryptogein induced prolonged ros production and _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ correlated well and both of them were significantly enhanced in the _PROTEIN_ overexpressors in comparison with the control at a low concentration of cryptogein . dids severely inhibited cryptogein induced prolonged ros production as the rapid/transient ros production . taken together these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ mediated anion flux is involved in the regulation of cryptogein induced _PROTEIN_ of respiratory burst oxidase homologs and nadph oxidase mediated ros production . rbohs have been suggested to be involved in ros production and the regulation of hypersensitive cell death in arabidopsis and rice . to further characterize the role of _PROTEIN_ in the downstream signaling pathway elicited by cryptogein we analyzed the induction of defense related genes and hypersensitive cell death in the _PROTEIN_ overexpressors . hypersensitive related gene that encodes a serine hydrolase with esterase activity is postulated to regulate either the establishment or limitation of cell death . the _PROTEIN_ of is correlated with hypersensitive responses . the _PROTEIN_ of and were induced h after the application of cryptogein in non transgenic cells . at lower concentration range of the elicitor the _PROTEIN_ of both and were significantly higher in the _PROTEIN_ overexpressors than in the control . at higher concentrations of cryptogein the _PROTEIN_ of the genes was almost comparable between the overexpressors and the control . cryptogein induced the _PROTEIN_ of in a dose dependent manner and in _PROTEIN_ overexpressing cells . the amount of each mrna was calculated from the threshold point located in the log linear range of the rt pcr . the relative level of each gene in the control cells at time . total rna was isolated from by cells harvested h after the addition of cryptogein at various concentrations . data are the mean _PROTEIN_ of three independent experiments . p < p < significantly different from the control line . hypersensitive cell death as a form of programmed cell death is a crucial event to prevent the spread of biotrophic pathogens . anion efflux has been suggested to be involved in the regulation of cryptogein induced hypersensitive cell death in cultured tobacco cells . evans blue staining was applied to quantify the levels of cell death . as shown in hypersensitive cell death was much more evident in the _PROTEIN_ overexpressors than that of the control cells and the levels of cell death corresponded with the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ .

manner in _PROTEIN_ overexpressing cells . by cells h after the addition of the cryptogein elicitor at various concentrations . evans blue staining was applied to quantify the level of cryptogein
