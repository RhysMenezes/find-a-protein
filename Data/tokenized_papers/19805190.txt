plants have intercellular channels plasmodesmata that span the cell wall to enable cell to cell transport of micro and macromolecules . we identified an arabidopsis thaliana embryo lethal mutant increased size exclusion limit _PROTEIN_ that results in increased pd mediated transport of _METHOD_ tracers . the _PROTEIN_ mutants have a higher frequency of branched and twinned pd than wild type embryos . silencing of _PROTEIN_ in mature nicotiana benthamiana leaves also leads to increased pd transport as monitored by intercellular movement of a _METHOD_ fusion to the tobacco mosaic virus movement protein . _PROTEIN_ encodes a putative plant specific dead box rna helicase that localizes specifically to mitochondria . the n terminal aa of _PROTEIN_ specify mitochondrial targeting . mitochondrial metabolism is compromised severely in _PROTEIN_ mutant embryos because their mitochondrial proton gradient is disrupted and reactive oxygen species production is increased . although mitochondria are essential for numerous cell autonomous functions the present studies demonstrate that mitochondrial function also regulates the critical cell non cell autonomous function of pd .
we developed an assay for alterations in pd mediated transport of _METHOD_ tracers during embryogenesis . basically when embryos are extruded from their seed coats small breaks arise in a few of the external cell walls of embryos . these breaks provide sites of entry for _METHOD_ tracers and depending on the _PROTEIN_ of the cells at the break site tracers can move either into the internal cells of the embryo or not . during early stages of embryogenesis tracers move readily into the internal cell layers . however wild type embryos stop trafficking kda fluorescein conjugated dextran at the midtorpedo stage . in contrast sibling _PROTEIN_ mutant embryos sustain trafficking of kda f dextran at this developmental stage . the recessive _PROTEIN_ mutant allele was derived from ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis that induces point mutations . single nucleotide polymorphism markers were used to construct a detailed physical map to identify the _PROTEIN_ gene . sequencing of dna from heterozygous _PROTEIN_ plants compared with wild type revealed a guanine to adenine substitution at nucleotide of locus _GENE_ resulting in the substitution of glutamic acid for glycine at codon . _PROTEIN_ consists of nt encoding a aa protein with a calculated molecular _METHOD_ of kda . there are no introns in the coding sequence however there is an intron in the utr . _PROTEIN_ encodes a highly conserved aa dead box rna helicase domain and a unique aa n terminal domain . _PROTEIN_ was described previously as rna helicase . _PROTEIN_ has all highly conserved motifs necessary for the rna helicase function of dead box proteins . the missense mutation in the _PROTEIN_ allele substitutes glutamic acid for the first glycine of the conserved gg loop of the dead box domain . a similarly charged amino acid substitution of aspartic acid for the homologous glycine residue in the gg loop of eukaryotic initiation _PROTEIN_ in saccharomyces cerevisiae results in a lethal loss of function . in the cocrystal structure of the drosophila melanogaster dead box protein vasa with a single stranded _LOCATION_ acid the gg loop contacts the sugar phosphate backbone of rna . when gg is mutated to eg the charged glutamic acid likely interferes with rna binding . thus the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype is expected to be the result of lost or reduced rna helicase function due to disruption of the gg loop . fig refc summarizes the phylogeny of the _PROTEIN_ protein . homologs of _PROTEIN_ occur in all green plants for which quality sequence databases are available such as the higher plants arabidopsis rice and grape the moss physcomitrella and the unicellular algae ostreococcus tauri . _PROTEIN_ is present as a single or recently duplicated gene in each of these species thus supporting a conserved function for _PROTEIN_ throughout the plant lineage . two additional mutant alleles _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were identified originally as agrobacterium mediated t dna insertions in locus _PROTEIN_ . genetic tests confirmed allelism between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the t dna insert in _PROTEIN_ is bp upstream of the start of translation and likely interferes with transcription of _PROTEIN_ . the t dna insert in _PROTEIN_ is located in the _PROTEIN_ exon at the position corresponding to amino acid this large insertion results in loss of the c terminal portion of _PROTEIN_ . homozygous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant embryos _PROTEIN_ a large _PROTEIN_ and allow kda f dextran transport when wild type sibling embryos do not . the _PROTEIN_ mutants typically arrest before the mid torpedo stage _PROTEIN_ embryos traffic kda f dextran as expected because wild type embryos also traffic this tracer at all stages before the midtorpedo stage . the embryo shown in fig refg and h is a globular shaped embryo that illustrates the lack of distinct morphogenesis in _PROTEIN_ embryos . the more severe phenotype of _PROTEIN_ is logical because the _PROTEIN_ lesion eliminates the _PROTEIN_ of the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ . because embryos lacking full length _PROTEIN_ can not survive past early stages of development _PROTEIN_ is an essential gene product . to provide insight into _PROTEIN_ function during embryogenesis and its role in pd regulation we determined its cellular localization pattern . we produced transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ at the n _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or c terminus _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ . the native promoter region _PROTEIN_ driving _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ produced viable transgenic plants and fully rescued the embryo defective phenotype of the strong _PROTEIN_ allele such _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants can not be distinguished from wild type plants . a pcr analysis of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ population in phenotypically normal plants identified plants homozygous for the _PROTEIN_ mutant allele . further studies of progeny of rescued _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants indicated the presence of a single copy of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene . in contrast no rescue of the _PROTEIN_ phenotype occurred in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants . rescued embryos were fully wild type in morphology and developmental timing . the rt pcr analyses of endogenous _PROTEIN_ transcripts reveal _PROTEIN_ in all tissues and at all developmental times . we also monitored the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in rescued _PROTEIN_ transgenic arabidopsis plants by _METHOD_ microscopy . the strongest _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ occurs in root and shoot meristematic regions . in roots this _PROTEIN_ extends upward into the elongation zone . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is also _PROTEIN_ in flowers with the highest _PROTEIN_ in the gynoecium . note that _PROTEIN_ is incorrectly annotated as the immediately downstream gene at genevestigator . the transcomplementing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein localized to distinct cytoplasmic foci in diameter in _PROTEIN_ heart arabidopsis embryos . fig refa d shows colocalization between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ foci and mitotracker red labeled mitochondria in embryos and fig . a d shows similar colocalization patterns in cells of the root in arabidopsis seedlings . note that in the colocalization panels yellow _METHOD_ marks the most intensely colocalized mitochondria however the individual red or green _METHOD_ panels clearly reveal additional patterns of identical _METHOD_ . we hypothesized that the unique n terminal aa of _PROTEIN_ just upstream of the dead box rna helicase domain contain a mitochondrial transit peptide . indeed an n terminal mitochondrial transit peptide is predicted weakly by protein sorting software . agrobacterium carrying a construct to _PROTEIN_ the n terminal aa of _PROTEIN_ fused _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was used to infect nicotiana benthamiana leaves . we coexpressed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with a known mitochondrial transit peptide marker mitochodria targeted _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . fig refe h documents that mito _METHOD_ and the first aa of _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ colocalize when transiently coexpressed . finally we transfected a stable transgenic n. benthamiana line _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with mito _METHOD_ once again _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and mito _METHOD_ colocalize . these studies together demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localizes to mitochondria in embryos seedlings and mature leaves and that targeting is mediated by a signal peptide in the first aa . to determine if pd function or regulation is altered in _PROTEIN_ mutants due to alterations in pd morphology we compared the ultrastructure of pd in wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ embryos . we found three types of pd structures in developing midtorpedo stage embryos simple pd branched pd and twinned pd . table reveals that _PROTEIN_ mutant embryos have a higher frequency of branched pd compared with their wild type siblings . for comparison and to ensure the accuracy of our characterization of pd ultrastructure we measured modified pd in the _PROTEIN_ mutant previously we found modified pd in _PROTEIN_ . here we find modified pd in _PROTEIN_ in close agreement with our earlier results . here we also measured twinned pd defined as pd that are within nm of each other . twinned pd likely represent newly arising pd in close juxtaposition . wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutants have a similar frequency of twinned pd and respectively _PROTEIN_ embryos have an increase in twinned pd suggesting that there may be an increase in pd synthesis in _PROTEIN_ embryos . because ultrastructural analyses only detect major morphological changes minor alterations that nevertheless significantly affect pd function in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ likely are missed . branched and twinned plasmodesmata because _PROTEIN_ mutants arrest during embryonic development we can not examine the requirement for _PROTEIN_ in mature mutant tissues . instead we induced loss of _PROTEIN_ function in mature leaves by an rna silencing strategy based on viral induced gene silencing and the widely used tobacco rattle virus system . because the trv system uses n. benthamiana as its host we first identified two homologs of _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana . fig . compares _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis and n. benthamiana . two weeks after induction of _PROTEIN_ silencing the newly arising upper leaves are slightly chlorotic which is not unexpected for the silencing of an essential gene . transcript levels from both n. benthamiana _PROTEIN_ homologs are significantly reduced by vigs . then pd transport was assayed in these newly arising _PROTEIN_ silenced leaves by agrobacterium mediated _PROTEIN_ of the tobacco mosaic virus movement protein fused to _METHOD_ . tmv _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ in isolated leaf epidermal cells by infiltrating dilute cultures of agrobacterium . tmv is a well established marker for pd mediated cell to cell spread in tobacco tissues . fused to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ distinct puncta in cell walls and allows higher resolution and better quantification of cell to cell movement patterns than free _METHOD_ that _METHOD_ a diffuse pattern . _METHOD_ moves less extensively than _METHOD_ and better reveals alterations in movement patterns . we monitored the relative cell to cell spread of _METHOD_ within the epidermis of _PROTEIN_ silenced and nonsilenced control leaves . _METHOD_ spread is increased dramatically in _PROTEIN_ silenced leaves compared with control leaves . counting the number of surrounding epidermal cells away from the initial agrobacterium transformed cell that displays _METHOD_ punctae in its cell walls provides a quantitative measure of _METHOD_ movement . fig refc and d compares _METHOD_ spread at and h postinfection in control and _PROTEIN_ silenced leaves the results are derived from counting > foci for each type of leaf . these data reveal that _METHOD_ moves more extensively in _PROTEIN_ silenced leaves compared with control leaves recapitulating the phenotype of _PROTEIN_ mutants . these data imply that pd function or regulation have been altered by silencing of _PROTEIN_ in mature tissue . thus loss of _PROTEIN_ function in arabidopsis embryos or n. benthamiana leaves leads to an identical phenotype of increased intercellular movement via pd . the hallmarks of defective mitochondrial function are the increased production of reactive oxygen species and reduced respiration . in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant embryos and seedlings and _PROTEIN_ silenced tissues exhibit increased production of the ros as would be expected in tissue with defective mitochondrial electron transport . although _PROTEIN_ mutants contain intact mitochondria as observed by transmission electron microscopy respiration likely is disrupted in _PROTEIN_ mutant embryos because _PROTEIN_ mutant mitochondria do not stain with mitotracker red a dye that is dependent upon mitochondrial transmembrane potential for specific accumulation in mitochondria . this latter result indicates that the electrochemical proton gradient is disrupted in the mitochondria of _PROTEIN_ mutants .
the _PROTEIN_ heterozygotes were transformed with agrobacterium carrying plasmids containing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . transformants were screened on basal medium containing hygromycin b . the plants were screened for the _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion using a three primer pcr that produces a bp product from the wild type _PROTEIN_ allele and an bp product from the _PROTEIN_ mutant allele . this pcr strategy allowed detection of rescued _PROTEIN_ homozygotes in the population . segregation of the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype was tracked in the generation by examining the segregation of developing mutant embryos in the siliques of plants . transgenic n. benthamiana plants constitutively _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were generated by the ralph m. parsons foundation plant transformation facility at university of california davis . nicotiana benthamiana was transformed with agrobacterium tumefaciens carrying plant _PROTEIN_ constructs . after growth in liquid lb at bacteria were pelleted and resuspended in mm mes mm and acetosyringone at densities of for cell to cell movement assays and for colocalization studies and induction of vigs . cultures were induced in as for h before infiltration . nicotiana benthamiana plants were grown < h in light at room temperature . cultures were injected into leaves with needleless ml syringes . bright field and _METHOD_ microscopy of embryos was performed on a zeiss axio imager microscope . seedlings and mature plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins were imaged with a zeiss stereo lumar _METHOD_ dissecting microscope . each microscope was fitted with a ccd camera and images were captured using ivision software confocal microscopy was performed on a zeiss meta uv vis microscope equipped with argon ion and helium/neon lasers . the _METHOD_ was excited with the nm laser band and emitted light was collected between and nm . the _METHOD_ was excited at nm and emitted light was collected between and nm . for colocalization images _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was false colored in red to allow better visualization of its _METHOD_ in the presence of _METHOD_ . mitotracker red was excited at nm and emitted light was collected between and nm . chlorophyll _METHOD_ was excited at nm and collected using a nm long pass filter . images of stained leaves and seedlings were acquired with a digital camera . _METHOD_ dye loading of mutant embryos was performed as in ref . citation . diaminobenzidine staining was performed by vacuum infiltrating dab staining solution into plant tissue . staining was allowed to proceed overnight before removal of chlorophyll with ethanol . mitochondria were stained by incubating seedlings or embryos in nm mitotracker red cmxros in murashige and skoog media in the dark for min before imaging . wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ embryos were prepared for transmission electron microscopy as described in ref . citation . samples were viewed with a philips/fei tecnai microscope . for measurement of pd structure at least three different sections were examined . the sequence was amplified from n. benthamiana total cdna using primers tttctcgaggtgattcagtcgtacacaggt and tacggatccgaaaaaggcactgttgcaga . this fragment was cloned into _PROTEIN_ i.e. to generate . for a nonsilencing control a fragment of the gus gene was cloned into _PROTEIN_ with primers and to generate . and then were introduced separately into agrobacterium . viral induced gene silencing then was performed on to week old n. benthamiana plants according to a standard protocol . tobacco rattle virus containing gus sequences instead of the _PROTEIN_ silencing trigger acts as the nonsilencing control . fourteen days after infiltration of vigs constructs the upper silenced leaves of n. benthamiana plants were agroinfiltrated with cultures for _PROTEIN_ of tmv _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . samples from these leaves then were observed at or h postinfiltration on a meta confocal laser scanning microscope . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ foci were located and the number of cells in each focus was counted . approximately lesions and > experiments were scored for each treatment .
