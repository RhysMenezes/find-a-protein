_PROTEIN_ proteins are plant specific histone deacetylases . little is known about the function of _PROTEIN_ proteins in plants . in this paper we report that an arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ is involved in abscisic acid and abiotic stress responses . analysis of arabidopsis plants containing the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion gene revealed that _PROTEIN_ was constitutive _PROTEIN_ in plants . furthermore _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was repressed by abscisic acid . over _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in transgenic arabidopsis plants conferred an abscisic acid insensitive phenotype . in addition _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants displayed reduced transpiration and enhanced tolerance to salt and drought stresses when compared with wild type plants . the _PROTEIN_ of several abscisic acid responsive genes was affected in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants . our study provides evidence indicating that _PROTEIN_ can modulate abscisic acid and stress responses .
to investigate the function of _PROTEIN_ the coding sequence of _PROTEIN_ was fused in frame with the _METHOD_ reporter gene driven by the camv promoter in the binary vector . the construct was used to transform arabidopsis plants . four independent transgenic lines were assayed for the presence and _PROTEIN_ of the transgenes . two transgenic lines with high _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were selected for further studies . to investigate the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protoplasts were isolated from seedlings of transgenic arabidopsis and localization of the fusion protein was determined by _METHOD_ microscope . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized in the _LOCATION_ of the arabidopsis cells . however _PROTEIN_ was not diffusely distributed in the nucleoplasm but localized to a much smaller area suggesting nucleolus localization . this result is consistent with previous observations that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are localized in nucleoli . in comparison _METHOD_ alone was uniformly distributed throughout the cell . compared to wild type seeds _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seeds germinated earlier . to test aba sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants seeds were incubated for germination on a medium with of aba . as shown in figure aba caused a _PROTEIN_ in the germination rate of the wild type seeds whereas there was only a _PROTEIN_ in the germination rate of the two _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic lines . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ seeds therefore displayed _PROTEIN_ sensitivity to aba . when the wild type seeds were germinated at aba there was growth arrest with inhibition of cotyledon formation and further development subsequent to seed coat breakage and radicle emergence . on the other hand the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic seeds were able to germinate and successfully develop healthy cotyledons and true leaves at aba . as shown in figure aba was able to inhibit root growth in wild type seedlings by . in comparison the root growth of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic seedlings was not affected at aba . there is substantial evidence for cross talk between signaling pathways regulating response to aba and assorted stresses . it has been shown that aba deficient and aba insensitive mutants tend to exhibit salt insensitivity during germination . therefore we tested the salt sensitivity of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants . at mm nacl the germination rate of the wild type was whereas the germination rates of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were and respectively . additionally the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ over _PROTEIN_ lines demonstrated _PROTEIN_ sensitivity to the inhibition of root growth by nacl . at mm nacl wild type root growth was only of its control rate whereas those of the two _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines were of the control rates . mannitol accumulation increases when plants are exposed to drought stress and mannitol has been used to assess the response of plants to osmotic stress . at mm mannitol the germination rate was reduced by in the wild type whereas those of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines were reduced by only . additionally the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ over _PROTEIN_ lines demonstrated _PROTEIN_ sensitivity to the inhibition of root growth by mannitol . at mm mannitol wild type root growth was only of its control rate whereas those of two _PROTEIN_ lines were about of the control rates . apart from its critical function in _PROTEIN_ seed dormancy regulating germination and seedling growth aba helps optimize vegetative growth during environmental stress conditions by _PROTEIN_ osmotic homeostasis . at the cellular level aba is known to promote tolerance to abiotic stresses such as cold drought and salinity . we investigated the response of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants to abiotic stresses by exposing them to salt and drought stresses . at days old plants were supplemented with mm nacl for days and the leaf survival rates were measured as the percentages of green leaves left after treatment . on the day after treatment only of the wild type leaves were green whereas of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ leaves were green . on the day after treatment about of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ leaves survived whereas the survival rate of the wild type was just . we further examined the ability of the _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants to survive in the environment of water deficit . at days old wild type and transgenic plants grown in pots were left without watering for up to days . as shown in figure the survival rate of the wild type dropped to on the day whereas the survival rate of the two transgenic lines was . on the day only of the wild type leaves survived whereas of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ leaves were alive . we also measured the fresh weight loss of the wild type and transgenic plants . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants show a _PROTEIN_ decline in fresh weights compared with the wild type plants when exposed to drought . additionally the stomatal aperture was investigated in the wild type and transgenic plants . under normal growth conditions of the wild type stomata were open whereas and of them were open in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants when observed in the middle of the watering period . thus over _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ resulted in partial stomatal closure reduced transpiration and enhanced drought tolerance . most of the genes that respond to dehydration salinity and low temperature are inducible by aba . many genes that respond to aba are also _PROTEIN_ at the _PROTEIN_ stages of embryogenesis during the development of seeds and are thought to function in the protection of cell dehydration . therefore we checked the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ class genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which function during the _PROTEIN_ phase of seed maturation to confer desiccation tolerance to the seed and are known to accumulate during dehydration stress in the vegetative stage . as shown in figure up regulation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was observed in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants . genetic studies have established that _PROTEIN_ is a regulator of aba transduction signals . the increases of _PROTEIN_ mrna level and corresponding protein phosphatase activity induced by aba have led to a model in which _PROTEIN_ takes part in a negative feedback regulatory loop that continuously resets the aba signaling cascade to adjust the response to the aba level . _PROTEIN_ is positioned upstream of induced s type anion channel activation whereby k efflux is initiated in the guard cells leading to stomatal closure . the _PROTEIN_ transcript level was severely reduced in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants . this led us to examine the _PROTEIN_ of a _PROTEIN_ inducible gene _PROTEIN_ as citation demonstrated a reduction in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mutants . accordingly we observed a down regulation of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic lines . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are k inward rectifying channels that are regulated by their phosphorylation status and are inhibited by aba production during dehydration stress . this mediates the closing of stomata due to turgor loss and _LOCATION_ depolarization which permits retention of water . we found that the _PROTEIN_ of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was reduced in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants . xylem k content is regulated by the activity of a stelar k outward rectifier _PROTEIN_ which is repressed by aba . repression of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ has been suggested to be part of the _PROTEIN_ water stress response mediated by aba . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was also reduced in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants . in summary our analysis indicates that over _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ resulted in the modulation of aba/stress responsive gene _PROTEIN_ . to further investigate the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ a kb _PROTEIN_ promoter fragment was used to construct a _PROTEIN_ reporter gene fusion _PROTEIN_ for stable transformation of arabidopsis . _PROTEIN_ gus was _PROTEIN_ in all tissues examined including seedlings mature rosette leaves _METHOD_ flowers and seeds . this result is consistent with our previous rt pcr analysis data . we further investigated whether aba can affect the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ gus by treating seedlings with aba . our analysis indicated that _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ was reduced after aba treatment . we also analyzed the transcript accumulation of _PROTEIN_ in response to aba treatment by rt pcr . as shown in figure the _PROTEIN_ transcript was partially reduced in the seedlings treated with aba . the modulation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by aba supports the idea that _PROTEIN_ is involved in the aba response .
to generate the _PROTEIN_ gus construct a kb promoter of _PROTEIN_ was pcr amplified using the primer pair cgttgaattcctcttttgtcctcctt and aattaagcttgtgcgaggtagtgtgatc . the resulting pcr product was digested by ecori and hindiii and subcloned into the binary vector . to construct the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plasmid we subcloned _PROTEIN_ cdna fused in frame with _METHOD_ in the vector . pfu polymerase was used in the pcr reaction to minimize undesired mutations in the sequences . dna sequence analysis was carried out using blast searches and the vector nti suite program . total genomic dna from arabidopsis was extracted using plant dnazol reagent . total rna was isolated from arabidopsis using trizol reagent as described by the manufacturer . one microgram of total rna was used for the first strand cdna synthesis after incubation at for min . cdna was synthesized in a volume of that contained momlv reverse transcriptase buffer mm dithiothreitol poly primer mm dntps and units of momlv reverse transcriptase at for h. all pcr reactions were performed with units of taq polymerase the buffer provided by the supplier mm dntps and a pair of primers in a final volume of . pcr reaction parameters differed for each gene thermocycling conditions were for min followed by cycles of for min for min and for min with a final polymerization step at for min . the gene specific primer pairs used for the rt pcr are _PROTEIN_ atggagttctggggtgttgaag and tcaagcagctgcactgtgtttg _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ atggagttctggggtgttgaag and acacgtggtggtggtggtg _PROTEIN_ caagatccattggcgatagatacc and cctcttttctccgccggaag _PROTEIN_ tccacgtatcttcggccatg and tagcaccttctgcagcgcc _PROTEIN_ cttcatgaaacttagagggcaac and ccactttggctctctctatc _PROTEIN_ aggttgctctgatgcagatc and ccgcattcgtgacctttgtg _PROTEIN_ gataccttccgaccagatagc and cgaaaaccccatagtcccaac _PROTEIN_ cagctctagctcggaggatg and ccgggaagcttttccttgatc _PROTEIN_ gtggctccaaagagcctaaag and acacaagaagcctccggaac ubq gatctttgccggaaaacaattggaggatggt and cgacttgtcattagaaagaaagagataacagg . arabidopsis thaliana was grown in a growth chamber after a day stratification period . for growth under sterile conditions seeds were surface sterilized and sown on a half strength murashige and skoog _METHOD_ medium _PROTEIN_ supplemented with sucrose ph and w/v agar in petri dishes . to test aba nacl and mannitol responses surface sterilized seeds were planted in _METHOD_ medium with different concentration of aba nacl and mannitol and root lengths were measured after days . for salt and drought treatment day old soil grown plants were supplemented with mm nacl or withheld completely from water for the specified times . to examine guard cells leaves were excised from week old soil grown plants in the middle of the watering and light periods . leaves of similar developmental stages from different plants of wild type and transgenic lines were placed on slides abaxial side up immediately after excision and the number of guard cells was then counted in randomly chosen fields usually six or seven . plant transformation plasmids were electroporated into agrobacterium tumefaciens . the agrobacterium mediated transformation of a. thaliana was performed as described previously . seeds were harvested dried at and germinated on sterile medium containing kanamycin or hygromycin to select the transformants . surviving plantlets were transferred to soil to set seeds . transgenic tissues _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gus were immersed in mm bromo chloro indolyl _PROTEIN_ acid solution in mm sodium phosphate with mm edta mm ferricyanide mm ferrocyanide and triton x and incubated at overnight followed by washing with ethanol to remove the chlorophyll . for fluorometric gus assays of the crude extract from seedlings was incubated at with mm methylumbelliferyl _PROTEIN_ in ml of gus assay buffer . after and h of incubation ml aliquots were removed and added to ml of m to terminate the reaction . gus activity was _PROTEIN_ as pmol methylumbelliferone/mg protein/min .
