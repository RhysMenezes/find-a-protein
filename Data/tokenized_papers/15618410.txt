an arabidopsis l. heynh mutant deficient in an isoform of adenylate kinase _PROTEIN_ was isolated by reverse genetics . it contains a t dna insertion bp downstream of the start point of transcription . the mutant lacks _GENE_ transcripts and has a mild reduction in total cellular _PROTEIN_ activity . green _METHOD_ protein fusion based cellular localization experiments carried out with the full length _GENE_ suggested a _LOCATION_ localization for this isoform . in keeping with this observation organelle isolation experiments revealed that the loss in _PROTEIN_ activity was confined to the inner _LOCATION_ . this _LOCATION_ stroma _PROTEIN_ gene was found to be _PROTEIN_ tissue constitutively but at much higher levels in illuminated leaves . phenotypic and biochemical analyses of the mutant revealed that it exhibited higher amino acid biosynthetic activity in the light and was characterized by an enhanced root growth . when the mutant was subjected to either continuous light or continuous dark growth phenotypes were also observed in the shoots . while the levels of adenylates were not much altered in the leaves the pattern of change observed in the roots was consistent with the inhibition of an _PROTEIN_ consuming reaction . taken together these data suggest a role for the _LOCATION_ stromal _PROTEIN_ in the coordination of metabolism and growth but imply that the exact importance of this isoform is tissue dependent .
in silico screening of the arabidopsis genome with the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ isoform of potato revealed nine genes of very high sequence homology . when analysis was performed at the nucleotide level these genes formed four phylogenetic clusters . the majority of these genes are presently annotated as putative _PROTEIN_ their transcription has however been verified by microarray experimentation . the predicted _PROTEIN_ encoding gene _GENE_ fell into the same phylogenetic group as the potato _LOCATION_ isoform of _PROTEIN_ with which it showed identity . despite these similarities it is important to note that as yet none of the arabidopsis genes have been functionally characterized and that the subcellular localizations presented here were determined merely on the basis of bioinformatic prediction . in order to confirm the localization of the protein encoded by _GENE_ the complete coding region was fused at the _PROTEIN_ terminal end to an enhanced _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and transiently _PROTEIN_ in leaf cells . in these cells _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected coincident with chlorophyll _METHOD_ suggesting a _LOCATION_ location of the protein . when taken together with the structural similarity of this gene to the _LOCATION_ isoform of _PROTEIN_ from potato this subcellular localization provides compelling molecular evidence that this gene is the arabidopsis ortholog to stpadk . a plant carrying a t dna insertion within _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ was identified by pcr screening of the t dna insertional mutant population gabi kat . a plant homozygous for the mutation was identified by pcr screening of a segregating population . sequencing of a pcr fragment encompassing the t dna/genomic dna junction revealed that this line carries an insertion within the coding sequence of the _PROTEIN_ gene . segregation analysis of the selectable marker and southern blot hybridization indicated that this mutant carries a single t dna insertion . _PROTEIN_ analysis of _PROTEIN_ in different tissues of wild type plants showed that the transcript is present in all the organs tested suggesting a tissue constitutive _PROTEIN_ of the gene with maximal _PROTEIN_ observed in floral tissue . the homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant however completely lacked _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was also studied throughout the diurnal cycle in wild type plants grown for d in a h h dark regime followed by d of growth in which plants were either _PROTEIN_ in the same growth conditions subjected to continuous light or subjected to continuous darkness . there was a general tendency of increased gene _PROTEIN_ in the light which is consistent with previous observations in rice and potato and consequently a depressed level of _PROTEIN_ during the dark period . however _PROTEIN_ appears to be _PROTEIN_ throughout the diurnal cycle . on subjection to continuous light an altered periodicity in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was observed with maximal _PROTEIN_ coincident with what was the middle of the dark period . in continuous darkness a faint band is observed throughout the time course . we assayed the enzyme activity in both total cell extracts and isolated chloroplasts of the wild type and mutant . we observed that approximately to of the _PROTEIN_ activity is localized to the _LOCATION_ in arabidopsis . this is quantitatively very similar to the distribution observed previously in tobacco cells and leaves . when assayed in the absence of detergent there was only a minor _PROTEIN_ in both total cellular and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ activity of the homozygous mutant . however in the presence of detergent the _LOCATION_ activity measured in the mutant was of that measured in the wild type . _PROTEIN_ activity in leaves from col and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants arabidopsis leaves from week old plants were sampled after h in dark and chloroplasts were isolated as described by citation . _PROTEIN_ activity was measured in both the _LOCATION_ fraction and the supernatant with and without triton following the protocol described by citation . values are _PROTEIN_ in nmol mg se and are means from three replicates . numbers in bold type denote significant differences determined by the student 's t test from col . we next grew the mutant in soil under different light regiments and scored morphological parameters of the aerial parts of the plants . mutant plants growing in a h h dark photoperiod were indistinguishable from those of the control . however after d in continuous light the total aerial _METHOD_ accumulated by the mutant was higher than the wild type . intriguingly a contrasting result was achieved following d in continuous dark . in normal photoperiod and continuous light both the wild type and mutants developed to the reproductive stage synchronically but in darkness the mutant plants showed a delay of about to d to reach the flowering phase . in order to analyze root growth we germinated seeds on vertical agar plates and recorded root length every to d. as shown in figure the root lengths of the homozygous mutant plants were between and longer than that those of col . we next evaluated the levels of the major leaf _PROTEIN_ through a diurnal period . in long day conditions the _PROTEIN_ mutant clearly accumulated little or no suc despite containing similar levels as the wild type at the beginning of the light period . there was however little difference between the genotypes with respect to starch content . given that the _PROTEIN_ reaction is intimately associated with the level of _PROTEIN_ we chose to alter the production of this metabolite by subjecting both the wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant to continuous light for a period of d before sampling . although both genotypes displayed differences in the patterns of suc and starch accumulation there was surprisingly little difference between the genotypes under these conditions _PROTEIN_ . similarly under continuous darkness there was little difference in the levels of suc or starch . the glc and fru levels in leaves showed similar patterns when growing the plants under both continuous light and darkness and no differences between both genotypes were observed except under conditions of continuous darkness when the glc contents showed a marked increment at am in leaves from the mutant plants se for col and _PROTEIN_ respectively . we next determined the levels of nucleotides in plants growing under the various light regimes described above . for this purpose we determined the levels of _PROTEIN_ adp adp glc utp udp and udp glc by hplc of trichloroacetic acid extracts of leaves from both genotypes as described by citation . the levels of these metabolites were surprisingly indistinguishable between the two genotypes grown under the normal photoperiod . in contrast following d in continuous light the levels of both adp and _PROTEIN_ were elevated in the mutant with respect to those observed in the wild type control whereas in plants that were subjected to continuous dark for d the adp glc level and the deduced _PROTEIN_ ratio were elevated in the mutant with respect to the wild type . the levels of the uridinylates were however invariant between the genotypes in all light regimes tested . for analysis of root material we grew the two genotypes in hydroponic conditions and collected root samples for nucleotide and amino acid determination . given that the levels of nucleotides were so low in the roots it was difficult to detect some of the nucleotides following the hplc method used above . therefore we also used spectrophotometric cycling assays to determine the levels of _PROTEIN_ and adp . the levels of adp and total adenylates were significantly lower in the mutant while the _PROTEIN_ ratio was higher suggesting that the roots had an impaired energy status . as was observed in the leaves from this mutant there were no differences in the root uridinylate status . nucleotide levels in roots of week old plants of the arabidopsis genotypes roots were harvested h into the photoperiod from hydroponic cultures as described in materials and methods. samples were frozen immediately in liquid and extracted in trichloroacetic acid . values are means se from four to six plants per genotype . values set in bold type indicate those determined by the student 's t test to be significantly different from col . given that the _LOCATION_ is the predominant location for the biosynthesis of many amino acids and that these processes carry a heavy _PROTEIN_ burden we were particularly interested to investigate the amino acid composition in leaves of the _PROTEIN_ plants . figure shows the results obtained following determination of the amino acid composition of leaves in the middle of the light and dark periods of the diurnal cycle . the levels of almost all amino acids are marginally higher in the mutant plants . in sharp contrast with the exception of elevated iso contents the amino acid levels are not significantly different between genotypes during the dark period . the amino acid contents of root material from plants grown in hydroponic conditions were also analyzed . the mutant displayed a tendency of _PROTEIN_ root amino acid content under long day conditions when assessed on a per gram fw basis however this was only statistically significant in the cases of gly ala and aminobutyric acid . however when the plants were subjected to continuous light for d the levels of amino acids in the roots of the mutant were significantly higher than those of the wild type control . this was true for all the measured amino acids with the exception of gly thr met trp phe ile and lys and it was particularly pronounced in the cases of arg val and leu . somewhat intriguingly the pattern of change in the mutant following transfer to continuous light appears to be the opposite of that observed in the wild type . in contrast the change of both genotypes following transfer to continuous dark was largely conserved with the root amino acid content generally increasing in both cases . however the amino acids gln thr ala and met did not follow this trend since they were either _PROTEIN_ or unaltered in the mutant with respect to plants grown under long day conditions and as such were present at significantly lower levels than those found in the wild type roots subjected to continuous darkness . amino acid content in arabidopsis roots wild type and plants were grown under various light regimes and after weeks roots were harvested extracted and were quantified by hplc as described in materials and methods. data are means of replicates se from six individual plants and presented as nmol g . values in bold type denote those determined to be significantly different from col by the student 's t test . no differences were observed in root _PROTEIN_ content of the two genotypes with the exception that the starch level in _PROTEIN_ roots was significantly lower than that of the wild type control genotype under continuous light conditions . given that seeds are the major storage organs in arabidopsis we also determined the levels of starch and total protein in mature seeds from six homozygous mutant plants and their corresponding controls . mature seeds of col and _PROTEIN_ contained and of starch _PROTEIN_ respectively while the total protein content of these seeds was and mg _PROTEIN_ for col and _PROTEIN_ genotypes respectively .
arabidopsis seeds ecotype colombia and the accession gabi were obtained from the gabi kat collection . the seeds were germinated on murashige and skoog media containing suc and were grown in a growth chamber under a h h dark regime before transfer to soil where they were grown under the same conditions . screening and selection within the mutant population was done following the gabi kat instructions . approximately seeds of the generation were sterilized and sown on petri dishes containing murashige and skoog media supplemented with mg/l of sulfadiazin . after h in the dark at plates were transferred to a long day regime and selection was carried out on the criteria of survival until d after germination . the frequency of segregation corresponds to that expected following a single insertion event . resistant lines were subsequently screened for zygosity status by pcr analysis using a pair of primers annealing on the second and third exon of the _GENE_ gene _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and a third primer annealing of the left border of the t dna _PROTEIN_ . unless otherwise stated all biochemical and physiological measurements have been carried out with homozygous plants . genomic dna from col and gabi was isolated and digested with three different restriction enzymes lacking recognition sites on the t dna fragment used as a probe . southern blotting was performed as described by citation . the blot was hybridized with an approximately bp fragment comprising the left border of the t dna using standard conditions at . washes were carried out at low stringency _PROTEIN_ . total rna was isolated using the commercially available trizol kit according to the manufacturer 's suggestions . the rna was then size fractionated on a agarose mops formaldehyde gel prior to transfer to a nylon _LOCATION_ filter . filters were subsequently probed with a bp cdna fragment amplified by pcr using the gene specific primers detailed above . this fragment spans and nucleotides of the second and third exons of the gene respectively . following pcr amplification the identity of this fragment was confirmed by sequencing and blasting against the complete arabidopsis genome . these searches showed that this gene exhibited less than homology to other putative _PROTEIN_ encoding genes . hybridization of northern blots was carried out using this fragment as a probe and following standard protocols . filters were washed once for min at in ssc _PROTEIN_ once for min at in ssc _PROTEIN_ and finally for min at in ssc _PROTEIN_ . after washing the filters were exposed to x ray _METHOD_ for to d. the _PROTEIN_ gene was amplified from arabidopsis col leaf cdna by pcr using the following primers and . the pcr fragment was recombined into the entry vector pentrsd_topo making use of the gateway recombination system . subsequently the _PROTEIN_ gene was recombined into the destination vector encoding a c terminal _METHOD_ driven by cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . the plasmid was transiently _PROTEIN_ in leaf cells using _PROTEIN_ particle delivery system . _METHOD_ signals were observed by laser scanning confocal microscope _PROTEIN_ . images were generated using processing software from leica . the activity of _PROTEIN_ was measured following the protocol of citation in leaf material and chloroplast preparations that had been isolated as detailed by citation . contamination of these preparations by _LOCATION_ marker enzymes did not exceed in either the wild type or mutant tissue . tissue samples were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen . subsequently the samples were extracted either in ethanol _PROTEIN_ or in trichloroacetic acid as detailed by citation . the _PROTEIN_ contents were determined spectrophotometrically as described by citation while the amino acid contents were determined using the hplc protocol described by citation . the levels of nucleotides and nucleosides in leaves were determined using the hplc protocol defined by citation while in roots were determined by a cycling assay as described in citation . the recoveries of hplc protocols for nucleotides have been documented previously . recoveries of adp and _PROTEIN_ for root material following the cycling assays were determined to be and respectively . the t tests have been performed using the algorithm embedded into microsoft excel . the term significant is used in the text only when the change in question has been confirmed to be significant with the t test .
