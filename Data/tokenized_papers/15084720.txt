highly organized interphase cortical microtubule arrays are essential for anisotropic growth of plant cells yet little is known about the molecular _METHOD_ that establish and _PROTEIN_ the order of these arrays . the arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ mutant shows right handed helical growth in roots and etiolated hypocotyls . characterization of the mutant phenotypes suggested that _PROTEIN_ may control anisotropic cell expansion through mt dependent processes . _PROTEIN_ was identified by map based cloning and found to encode a small protein with unknown function . proteins homologous to _PROTEIN_ occur specifically and ubiquitously in plants . genetic complementation with green _METHOD_ protein fusion proteins indicated that the _PROTEIN_ protein colocalizes with cortical mts and that both mt localization and cell expansion control are conferred by the conserved n and c terminal regions . strong _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was found in tissues undergoing rapid cell elongation . plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ showed enhanced resistance to an mt drug and increased hypocotyl elongation . these observations suggest that _PROTEIN_ is a plant specific mt localized protein required for the _PROTEIN_ of growth anisotropy in rapidly elongating cells .
using the _PROTEIN_ mutant allele _PROTEIN_ was initially mapped close to the cleaved amplified _METHOD_ marker on chromosome . because sequence information was not available at the time and cosmid contigs were constructed for the mapped locus . new caps markers were created based on the partial dna sequences obtained from the clones in the contig and used to restrict the _PROTEIN_ gene to a kb region . because _PROTEIN_ was derived from a seed pool irradiated with fast neutrons we searched for a deletion or a rearrangement in the kb region of the _PROTEIN_ genome . restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and pcr amplification of the _PROTEIN_ and landsberg _LOCATION_ genomic dna within the target region revealed a kb deletion in a kb hindiii fragment . transformation of _PROTEIN_ mutants with the full length ler fragment rescued the helical growth defects indicating that the _PROTEIN_ gene lay in this region . sequence analysis revealed a bp deletion in the _PROTEIN_ allele that disrupted two genes _GENE_ and _GENE_ both of which were predicted to be _PROTEIN_ based on the presence of ests . to identify which of the two genes was responsible for the _PROTEIN_ phenotype four more mutant alleles _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were sequenced . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ contained deletions similar to that in the _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ harbored a t dna insertion immediately downstream of the putative _PROTEIN_ box element of _GENE_ . _PROTEIN_ had a bp deletion at an intron/exon junction of _GENE_ . furthermore a kb genomic fragment that spanned the entire coding region and the kb region of _GENE_ but only a small c terminal region of _GENE_ rescued the _PROTEIN_ mutant . taken together we concluded that _GENE_ encodes the _PROTEIN_ gene . consistent with large deletions or an insertion in the region _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants did not accumulate _PROTEIN_ transcripts . by contrast _PROTEIN_ had reduced _PROTEIN_ transcript level but slightly larger transcript size than that generated in the wild type plants . sequencing of rt pcr products revealed that the second intron of _PROTEIN_ was not spliced in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . this is consistent with the bp deletion in the _PROTEIN_ allele destroying the consensus acceptor sequence of the _PROTEIN_ second intron . the predicted _PROTEIN_ polypeptide consists of amino acids . a tblastn search of the genbank nucleotide database revealed no homologous gene with known biological or biochemical functions . numerous est sequences however were found to encode polypeptides homologous to _PROTEIN_ . these _PROTEIN_ related genes appear to exist ubiquitously in plants homologs were found in all plant species for which > est sequences have been deposited . _PROTEIN_ related sequences also were found in a moss est database . alignments of the protein sequences deduced from some of the est clones are shown in figures and . only the proteins from two brassicaceous species thellungiella halophila and descurainia sophia show amino acid identity with _PROTEIN_ along the entire polypeptide length . by contrast the closest homologs from each of the non brassicaceous species show sequence identity only in n and c terminal regions whereas the internal regions are highly variable . the arabidopsis genome contains five _PROTEIN_ homologs that we refer to as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ through _PROTEIN_ . again these _PROTEIN_ proteins share high sequence identity only in the n and c terminal regions . the n and c terminal regions show limited sequence similarity to each other . based on the est sequences deposited in the database all _PROTEIN_ genes except for _PROTEIN_ are predicted to be transcribed . because _PROTEIN_ protein sequence analysis did not provide information on likely functions we sought to determine where the _PROTEIN_ protein is localized in arabidopsis cells . to this end we created transgenic plants that _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein under the control of the kb region and the first intron of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . among the transgenic lines generated in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines complemented the helical growth phenotype indicating functional integrity of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein . confocal laser scanning microscopy _PROTEIN_ observation of these transgenic plants clearly showed fibrous structures in the cortical regions of hypocotyl and root epidermal cells . similar structures were observed in other organs including cotyledons petioles rosette leaves and inflorescences . when _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants were pretreated with the mt depolymerizing drug oryzalin the fibrous structures disappeared indicating that the observed structures were mts . localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to cortical mts was further confirmed by double immunostaining for _METHOD_ and tubulins . to confirm the mt localization of _PROTEIN_ in wild type plants an antiserum was produced with recombinant _PROTEIN_ proteins . on a protein gel blot this antiserum recognized a protein band at expected size for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in a microsomal fraction of wild type columbia but not in _PROTEIN_ . because the antiserum gave many nonspecific bands in both col and _PROTEIN_ extracts affinity purification was performed to give a single major band on a protein gel blot . this antibody preparation was then used for immunofluoresent staining on dark grown hypocotyls of wild type col seedlings . a _PROTEIN_ observation of cortical cell surface revealed fibrous structures characteristic of cortical mts . in a negative control experiment _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings showed only negligible _METHOD_ . similar fibrous structures were visualized by a cslm observation of _METHOD_ tubulin transgenic plants indicating that the _PROTEIN_ antibody stained the mts . the observed colocalization of _PROTEIN_ with cortical mts is consistent with the proposed role of _PROTEIN_ in mt dependent processes . as described above _PROTEIN_ and its homologs share sequence identity only in the n and c terminal regions whereas the internal sequence is highly variable . this raised a question as to whether the internal region is required for the function specific to each protein or primarily serves as a structural linker between the n and c terminal regions . furthermore we wanted to know if the conserved regions alone are sufficient for targeting _PROTEIN_ to cortical mts . to address these questions we created chimeric dna constructs that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins fused with n and/or c terminal regions of _PROTEIN_ under the promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus . these constructs were introduced into _PROTEIN_ mutants . as shown in figure replacing the internal sequence of _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ partially rescued the root skewing phenotype of _PROTEIN_ . microscopic analysis revealed that the helical growth of root epidermal cell files was also partially rescued . by contrast _METHOD_ fused with either the n or c terminal region alone or free _METHOD_ failed to rescue the _PROTEIN_ defects . root skewing angles of _METHOD_ transgenic plants wild type col and _PROTEIN_ mutants transgenic plants were then examined by _PROTEIN_ to observe the distribution of the _METHOD_ fusion proteins . only the ngc fusion protein was localized to cortical mts whereas the ng gc and g proteins were all distributed throughout the peripheral cytoplasm . these results indicate that the conserved n and c terminal regions act together in targeting _PROTEIN_ proteins to cortical mts and that the internal region may play minor roles as compared with the conserved n and c terminal regions . the coincidence between phenotypic rescue and mt localization further suggests that the primary function of _PROTEIN_ is related to its association with cortical mts . an rna gel blot analysis using total rnas from various organs of wild type arabidopsis plants indicated ubiquitous _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . to analyze _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ at the tissue level we made a construct in which the _PROTEIN_ reporter gene was placed under the kb _PROTEIN_ promoter described above and the kb region of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . this construct _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was introduced into wild type col plants by agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation . seedlings from independent transgenic lines were stained for gus activity . all lines showed a very similar staining pattern except for two that showed no staining . five lines harboring homozygous t dna insertion at a single locus were established and used for detailed _PROTEIN_ analysis described below . strong gus staining was found at the root tip including early elongation zone . in mature roots gus stain was present in all cell layers . in flowers strong gus activity was found in anthers stigmas and pollen . in young seedlings the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ appeared to be dependent on light and developmental stage . when seedlings were grown under continuous illumination of white light hypocotyls showed negligible staining whereas cotyledons started to _PROTEIN_ gus after d of growth . by contrast when seedlings were grown in the dark hypocotyls started to _PROTEIN_ gus after to d of growth whereas cotyledons remained unstained . the light dependent induction of gus _PROTEIN_ in the cotyledons was confirmed by exposing dark grown seedlings to continuous light . one day after the transfer cotyledons of the light exposed seedlings started to _PROTEIN_ gus whereas those of control seedlings left in the darkness remained unstained . gus staining in the root was constitutive no difference was observed between light and dark grown seedlings . interestingly the region of strong gus stain moved acropetally along the hypocotyls of dark grown seedlings . three or day old seedlings showed gus stain preferentially at the basal part of hypocotyls . four or five day old seedlings were stained in the middle region of hypocotyls . in d old seedlings gus stain revealed _PROTEIN_ only in the apical region of fully elongated hypocotyls . a similar _PROTEIN_ pattern was detected by immunostaining of dark grown wild type hypocotyls . in summary high _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was associated with tissues undergoing rapid cell expansion including the root elongation zone hypocotyls of dark grown seedlings and cotyledons of light grown seedlings . to gain further insight into the _PROTEIN_ function we generated transgenic plants that overexpressed _PROTEIN_ under the promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus _PROTEIN_ in the wild type col and ler backgrounds . rna gel blot analysis revealed that _PROTEIN_ plants accumulated to times more _PROTEIN_ transcript than corresponding nontransformants . the _PROTEIN_ plants were apparently normal . it is notable that the root epidermal appearance of the _PROTEIN_ roots was indistinguishable from those of the wild type increased _PROTEIN_ level did not cause left handed twisting of root epidermal cell files . this suggests that _PROTEIN_ does not simply act in biasing the cell elongation toward a certain direction . rather it suggests that _PROTEIN_ is necessary to _PROTEIN_ straight cell elongation . the _PROTEIN_ plants were found to be moderately more resistant to long term treatment with the mt depolymerizing drug propyzamide . when grown on a medium containing propyzamide plants from two independent _PROTEIN_ lines showed marginal survival whereas both ler and _PROTEIN_ plants died . to investigate the role of _PROTEIN_ in cell elongation we compared the cell elongation kinetics of _PROTEIN_ wild type col and _PROTEIN_ plants using dark grown hypocotyls the extension of which relies solely on cell expansion but not on cell division . seedlings of wild type col _PROTEIN_ and a _PROTEIN_ line made in the col background were grown in the dark . at h intervals positions of the shoot apical meristem were marked on the surface of petri dishes under a dissecting microscope illuminated with dim green light . at all time points hypocotyls of the _PROTEIN_ plants were longer than those of wild type plants . the differences were statistically significant at all time points . we repeated the same experiment and obtained a similar result . this observation suggests that enhancement of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels can increase cell elongation . by contrast hypocotyls of _PROTEIN_ mutants elongated at a rate similar to that of wild type plants up to d after germination . at this time point _PROTEIN_ hypocotyls did not show the helical growth . three days after germination elongation of _PROTEIN_ hypocotyls started to decline . it was at this time point that the upper part of the _PROTEIN_ hypocotyls developed the helical growth phenotype .
isolation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant alleles have been described . _PROTEIN_ was isolated from the institut national de la recherche agronomique t dna population . plants were grown as described previously unless noted otherwise . progenies from a cross between _PROTEIN_ and wild type col were used as a mapping population . the completely recessive _PROTEIN_ allele allowed simple linkage analysis between the _PROTEIN_ locus and the ler chromosome . the _PROTEIN_ locus was found to be closely linked to the caps marker that was located at the top end of chromosome . a genomic library was screened using the pcr fragment as a probe . three clones were obtained and aligned into a contig based on the bamhi restriction map . new caps markers were generated from the insert end sequences of the clones . use of these markers confined the _PROTEIN_ locus in a kb segment . a cosmid minilibrary was constructed from a pool of partially digested dnas and the vector . four cosmid clones that cover the kb genomic region were digested with hindiii and the fragments subcloned into pbluescript _PROTEIN_ . dna sequences derived from these subclones were used to generate a new set of caps markers and used for chromosomes . the _PROTEIN_ locus was finally restricted to a kb interval . genomic dnas from _PROTEIN_ and ler were digested with hindiii and subjected to a genomic dna gel blot using each of the two cosmid clones spanning the kb segment as a probe . a restriction fragment length polymorphism was found in a kb ler fragment which in _PROTEIN_ was kb . a series of pcr amplification steps were performed to scan the kb region and successfully detected kb deletion within the kb hindiii fragment . this fragment was introduced into the _PROTEIN_ mutant using binary vector and shown to rescue the _PROTEIN_ mutant defects . subsequent sequencing of five _PROTEIN_ alleles predicted that the gene _GENE_ encodes _PROTEIN_ . this was further confirmed by genetic complementation of _PROTEIN_ with a kb spei snabi genomic fragment that spanned the kb upstream region relative to the putative _PROTEIN_ box all exons and introns and the kb downstream region of _GENE_ . total rna was extracted from arabidopsis thaliana plants with the rnaeasy plant mini kit . rna was separated by a formaldehyde gel and transferred to hybond n _LOCATION_ according to the

fast protein liquid chromatography column or q sepharose fast flow resin . polyclonal rabbit antisera were produced using trx _PROTEIN_ as an antigen . for protein gel blotting antiserum was directly added at dilution . signal was detected with the ecl plus kit . for histochemical staining antiserum was purified in three steps to reduce nonspecific binding . the first step used protein a sepharose to purify whole igg fraction . the second step was to remove antibodies specific for the trx tag . this was accomplished by the use of recombinant trx immobilized on an nhs activated sepharose column . the third step involved affinity purification using purified mbp _PROTEIN_ protein immobilized on nhs activated sepharose . all antibody purification procedures were performed according to the described methods . for plant protein extraction arabidopsis seedlings were sliced into small pieces by razor blades and ground in ice cold extraction buffer containing mg/ml of butylated hydroxytoluene and polyclar _PROTEIN_ . after filtration through two layers of miracloth the insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation at for min at . microsomal proteins then were separated from the supernatant by centrifuging the protein extracts twice at for min at . immunoblot analysis was performed with hybond p _LOCATION_ and the ecl plus kit according to the manufacturer 's instructions . whole mount immunostaining was done by the method described for mt labeling with some modifications . seedlings were fixed for min in a solution containing paraformaldehyde made in pemt buffer .

temperature . alexa fluor conjugated anti rabbit igg was used as a secondary antibody . cslm observation was performed with a leica _PROTEIN_ confocal microscope . the nm argon laser beam was used for the excitation of _METHOD_ and alexa fluor . some images were processed by the photoshop program _METHOD_ to enhance image contrast . gus staining was done in a solution containing mm bromo chloro indolyl d _PROTEIN_ mm potassium phosphate ph mm potassium ferrocyanide mm potassium ferricyanide tween and methanol . after staining plants were incubated in ethanol at overnight then transferred to a series of _PROTEIN_ concentrations of ethanol . sequence data from this article have been deposited with the embl/genbank data libraries under the following accession numbers arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ homologs _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ homologs from other species are t. halophila d. sophia _PROTEIN_ soybean tomato cotton maize and rice . the moss _PROTEIN_ homolog sequence was retrieved from the physcobase database . nucleotide sequence for _PROTEIN_ is very likely to be misannotated in the database where coding regions for _PROTEIN_ and the preceding hydrolase like gene are fused together . in this study we separated the deposited nucleotide sequence into two genes and the latter half was designated _PROTEIN_ .
