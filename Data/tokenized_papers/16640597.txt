leaf senescence is a unique developmental process that is characterized by _METHOD_ programmed cell death and nutrient recycling . the underlying molecular regulatory _METHOD_ are not well understood . here we report the functional analysis of _PROTEIN_ a gene encoding a nac family transcription _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ of this gene is closely associated with the senescence process of arabidopsis rosette leaves . leaf senescence in two t dna insertion lines of this gene is significantly delayed . the t dna knockout plants are otherwise normal . the mutant phenotype can be restored to wild type by the intact _PROTEIN_ as well as by its homologs in rice and kidney bean plants that are also upregulated during leaf senescence . furthermore inducible overexpression of _PROTEIN_ causes precocious senescence . these data strongly suggest that _PROTEIN_ and its homologs play an important role in leaf senescence in arabidopsis and possibly in other plant species .
digital _PROTEIN_ profile analysis of the arabidopsis leaf senescence dbest and microarray analysis revealed that _PROTEIN_ is one of the most abundantly transcribed transcription _PROTEIN_ genes in senescing leaves . rna gel blot analysis showed that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in rosette leaves of arabidopsis is closely associated with the progression of leaf senescence . when leaves from the same _PROTEIN_ position were studied rna messenger of _PROTEIN_ was detected only when the leaves start senescing . leaf senescence in arabidopsis grown under non stressful conditions is age dependent and progresses sequentially from the oldest leaf to the top young leaves . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ transcript was detected in the old senescing leaves but not in the young green leaves . in a given leaf senescence starts from the leaf tip and progresses towards the leaf base . the yellow tip showed stronger _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ than the proximal part of a leaf . although _PROTEIN_ is predicted to be a _LOCATION_ protein by predictnls and psort it does not have any obvious _LOCATION_ localization signal . to determine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ a chimeric gene containing a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct driven by the promoter was transiently _PROTEIN_ in onion epidermal cells using particle bombardment . subcellular localization of the _METHOD_ fusion protein was visualized with a _METHOD_ microscope . dapi staining of dna revealed _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein localization in the _LOCATION_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ protein . the _PROTEIN_ gene consists of three exons and encodes a protein with amino acids . we obtained two salk t dna lines from the arabidopsis biological resource center _PROTEIN_ at ohio state university . line has a t dna insertion in the second exon and line has a t dna insertion in the promoter region . rna gel blot analysis showed that the _PROTEIN_ transcript in senescent leaves of the homozygous line was not detectable while _PROTEIN_ transcript levels in senescent leaves of line plants were reduced to of that in age matched wild type leaves . this suggests that line is an _PROTEIN_ null mutant while line is a knockdown line . to compare any phenotypic changes in growth and development among line _PROTEIN_ line _PROTEIN_ and wild type these plants were grown side by side in an arabidopsis growth chamber . there were no visible differences in growth and development except for the significantly delayed leaf senescence phenotype in the _PROTEIN_ null plants and the less significantly retarded leaf senescence phenotype in the _PROTEIN_ knockdown plants . we further characterized the _PROTEIN_ null mutant plants . as shown in the mortality curves in figure leaves of the _PROTEIN_ null mutant plants senesced _PROTEIN_ than those of wild type plants . consistent with a delayed visible yellowing phenotype chlorophyll levels in individual rosette leaves of the null line were generally higher than in counterpart leaves of the age matched wild type plants . the fv/fm ratios in individual leaves of the null line were also higher than in counterpart leaves of the age matched wild type plants . the fv/fm ratio reflects the photochemical quantum efficiency of photosystem ii as well as the photoreduction efficiency of the primary electron accepting plastoquinone of photosystem ii . in contrast ion leakage in individual leaves of the null plants was less than that in wild type plants . ion leakage is an indicator of the intactness of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of a senescing cell becomes fragile and leaky . we also monitored the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and the rubisco small subunit gene _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is a highly senescence specific gene in arabidopsis and has been widely used as a molecular marker for leaf senescence while _PROTEIN_ is a typical senescence downregulated gene . as shown in figure the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was readily detectable in leaf number of a day old wild type plant but it was barely detectable in leaf number of an age matched null plant . all the data described above indicate that the leaf senescence process was dramatically delayed in the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . to confirm that the t dna insertional null mutation in _PROTEIN_ is responsible for the delayed senescence phenotype we performed a complementation test experiment . the wild type copy of _PROTEIN_ including the kb promoter region was introduced into the _PROTEIN_ null mutant plants . the introduced _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in senescing leaves _PROTEIN_ . we characterized the senescence phenotype in leaves that are either detached or in planta . the leaves detached from the _PROTEIN_ complemented lines senesced in the same manner as the leaves from wild type did both phenotypically and in _METHOD_ of the fv/fm ratio . in planta leaves of the complemented plants also senesced in the same manner as wild type leaves . these data confirmed that loss of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ null mutant was the only cause of the delayed senescence phenotype . we further investigated the role of _PROTEIN_ in leaf senescence by performing gain of function analysis . considering the _PROTEIN_ that constitutive _PROTEIN_ of this gene might be lethal the chemical inducible gene _PROTEIN_ system was used . first we generated transgenic lines that harbored either the or _PROTEIN_ constructs . contains the chimeric transcription _PROTEIN_ gvg consisting of a dna binding domain of the yeast transcription _PROTEIN_ a transactivation domain of the herpes simplex virus transcriptional regulatory protein and a _PROTEIN_ receptor domain while _PROTEIN_ is a construct in which _PROTEIN_ is driven by a promoter containing six tandem copies of the upstream activation sequence . treatment with dexamethasone _PROTEIN_ caused precocious leaf yellowing and a significant reduction of the fv/fm ratio in plants _PROTEIN_ but not in controls _PROTEIN_ . rna blot analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was strongly induced in the plants but not in the controls . the precocious leaf yellowing was a senescence process because _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were both _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are leaf senescence specific marker genes . these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ is sufficient to promote leaf senescence . the amino acid sequence of _PROTEIN_ was analyzed using various genomic databases such as the genbank the tigr plant genome databases and populusdb and genes with high sequence similarity were identified from many different plant species . among them are the nac family transcription _PROTEIN_ pvnap from the dicot kidney bean with identity and the nac family transcription _PROTEIN_ osnap from the monocot rice with identity . we hypothesized that those homologs are functional orthologs of _PROTEIN_ . to test this hypothesis first we examined whether pvnap and osnap shared the same leaf senescence specific _PROTEIN_ pattern as _PROTEIN_ . kidney bean leaves at five distinct developmental stages ranging from young leaves to entirely yellow leaves were used for rna gel blot analysis of pvnap _PROTEIN_ . as shown in figure pvnap transcript was detected in senescing leaves only . the _PROTEIN_ of osnap was also shown to be senescence specific in rice leaves . to further test the hypothesis that the homologs are functional orthologs of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ we performed heterogeneous complementation tests . the kb _PROTEIN_ promoter was used to direct the _PROTEIN_ of the coding region of osnap or pvnap . these genes were _PROTEIN_ in senescent leaves of respective complementation lines . phenotypically fully expanded non senescing leaves detached from wild type plants became senescent after being incubated in darkness for days . in contrast age matched leaves from the _PROTEIN_ null mutant remained green and photosynthetically active . however the leaves of the null plants complemented with osnap or pvnap senesced like those of wild type . similar observations were obtained when natural leaf senescence was examined in intact plants . similarly to _PROTEIN_ osnap and pvnap were able to restore the arabidopsis null mutant to wild type which suggests that osnap and pvnap are functional orthologs of _PROTEIN_ .
