_PROTEIN_ is a soluble import receptor that recognizes peroxisomal targeting signal type _PROTEIN_ containing proteins . in the present study using a green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion protein of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ we analyzed the molecular function and subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis thaliana . the overexpression of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ resulted in defective glyoxysomal fatty acid oxidation but had no significant effect on leaf peroxisomal function . analysis of the subcellular localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in transgenic arabidopsis showed that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localizes primarily to the _LOCATION_ . transient _PROTEIN_ of a c or n terminal fusion protein of _PROTEIN_ and yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in leek epidermal cells using the particle bombardment technique confirmed that _METHOD_ protein tagged _PROTEIN_ localizes to _LOCATION_ in arabidopsis . immunoblot analysis revealed that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ accumulates primarily in peroxisomal _LOCATION_ fractions whereas endogenous _PROTEIN_ was distributed evenly in _LOCATION_ and peroxisomal _LOCATION_ fractions which indicated that both endogenous _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ are properly targeted to peroxisomal _LOCATION_ . the results of bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation and yeast two hybrid analyses showed that _PROTEIN_ binds directly to _PROTEIN_ containing proteins and _PROTEIN_ in the peroxisomal _LOCATION_ . we used red _METHOD_ protein fusion protein of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in several arabidopsis pex mutants to identify proteins required for the targeting of _PROTEIN_ to _LOCATION_ in planta . the results demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations disrupt the proper targeting of _PROTEIN_ to _LOCATION_ . overall our results suggest that the targeting of _PROTEIN_ to _LOCATION_ requires four proteins a _PROTEIN_ containing protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ .
to analyze the molecular mechanism of _PROTEIN_ function we constructed a chimeric gene encoding _METHOD_ fused to arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . the gene was inserted into a ti vector and then introduced into wild type arabidopsis using agrobacterium tumefaciens . transgenic arabidopsis progeny _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were selected and designated as _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . we first compared the phenotypes of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and wild type arabidopsis grown under normal atmospheric conditions . previously it was shown that plants with a defect in leaf peroxisomal function exhibit a dwarf phenotype with pale green leaves . as shown in figure the growth of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was similar to that of wild type plants which indicated that the overexpression of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ does not affect leaf peroxisomal function . it has been reported that plants lacking peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation become resistant to dichlorophenoxybutyric acid and require sucrose during post germinative growth . to determine the status of fatty acid oxidation in transgenic plants we examined the effect of db and sucrose on the growth of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . when _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings were grown on medium containing db they developed long roots which indicated that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was resistant to db . in addition _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings could not germinate in the absence of sucrose . it required sucrose for germination . these aspects of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ phenotype were identical to the _PROTEIN_ mutant which has a defect in the peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation enzyme ketoacyl coa thiolase . these results indicated that the overexpression of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in plants results in a defect in glyoxysomal fatty acid oxidation . to study the relationship between the glyoxysomal defect in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and the subcellular localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ we analyzed _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants by confocal laser scanning microscopy . as shown in figure all of the cells examined showed punctate green _METHOD_ which indicated that the majority of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localizes to _LOCATION_ in these cells . to confirm the peroxisomal localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ we constructed two chimeric cdnas encoding n and c terminal fusion proteins of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the chimeric cdnas were placed under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter and were then introduced into allium ampelopresum epidermal cells using the particle bombardment technique . a peroxisomal marker protein composed of the red _METHOD_ protein tdtomato and c terminal amino acid residues from hydroxypyruvate reductase _PROTEIN_ was also introduced into cells as a marker for transformation . cells were incubated for h after bombardment and then the subcellular localization of the transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins was examined . both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were detected in the _LOCATION_ and co localized with tdtomato _PROTEIN_ . the placement of _METHOD_ at either the n or c terminus of _PROTEIN_ did not affect the transport of _PROTEIN_ to _LOCATION_ . these results were consistent with the subcellular localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in transgenic arabidopsis and provided additional evidence that _METHOD_ fusion proteins of _PROTEIN_ are properly targeted to _LOCATION_ . we next analyzed whether _METHOD_ protein tagged _PROTEIN_ localized to the peroxisomal _LOCATION_ or peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ . total tissue homogenate was prepared from day old etiolated cotyledons of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and wild type arabidopsis . the crude homogenate was then treated separately with low salt buffer high salt buffer or alkaline solution and was then fractionated into supernatant and pellet after centrifugation . the protein fractions from the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and the wild type plants were analyzed by immunoblot using anti _METHOD_ anti _PROTEIN_ and anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies . as shown in figure anti _METHOD_ antibody _METHOD_ revealed that a kda protein corresponding to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was detected primarily in the pellet even after treatment with alkaline solution _METHOD_ . a small quantity of protein was also detected in the supernatant . these results indicated that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ accumulates in the peroxisomal _LOCATION_ . in contrast a kda protein corresponding to endogenous _PROTEIN_ from _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was present in approximately equal quantities in the supernatant and pellet even after treatment with alkaline solution _PROTEIN_ which suggested that endogenous _PROTEIN_ is present in two subcellular compartments the _LOCATION_ and the peroxisomal _LOCATION_ . these results were consistent with previous findings that _PROTEIN_ is targeted to _LOCATION_ and is then recycled back to the _LOCATION_ in mammals and yeast . as a control ketoacyl coa thiolase and peroxisomal ascorbate peroxidase were analyzed as markers for the peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ and the peroxisomal _LOCATION_ respectively . these results suggested that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is properly targeted to _LOCATION_ similar to endogenous _PROTEIN_ but that the addition of _METHOD_ inhibits the last step of the peroxisomal protein import pathway the recycling of _PROTEIN_ from the peroxisomal _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ . in day old etiolated cotyledons of wild type plants kda _PROTEIN_ and kda _PROTEIN_ were detected in both supernatant and pellet fractions _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ whereas in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was mostly detected in the pellet fractions with only a small quantity detected in the supernatant fractions _PROTEIN_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ is trapped on the _LOCATION_ together with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . previously the binding of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ was demonstrated using the yeast two hybrid system . to determine the subcellular localization of protein complexes composed of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ containing proteins in plant cells we carried out a series of bifc assays using n and c terminal fragments of _METHOD_ . an interaction between two proteins that are fused to two different _METHOD_ fragments results in the reconstitution of a functional _METHOD_ molecule with yellow _METHOD_ . we constructed two chimeric genes encoding the n terminal half of _METHOD_ fused to _PROTEIN_ and the n terminal amino acid residues of citrate synthase which contains a _PROTEIN_ fused to the c terminal half of _METHOD_ . these chimeras were designated as _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ respectively . we transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in leek epidermal cells together with tdtomato _PROTEIN_ using the particle bombardment technique . as shown in figure _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed exclusively in _LOCATION_ and the signal co localized perfectly with the red _METHOD_ of tdtomato _PROTEIN_ . these results demonstrated that _METHOD_ protein tagged _PROTEIN_ is targeted to the _LOCATION_ together with a _PROTEIN_ containing protein . to confirm these results we substituted a conserved arginine of the _PROTEIN_ sequence of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with glycine _PROTEIN_ to create _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . this mutation has been shown to disrupt the peroxisomal targeting of _PROTEIN_ . when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was co _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ together with tdtomato _LOCATION_ or tdtomato _PROTEIN_ weak _METHOD_ positive signals were detected in the _LOCATION_ . these results suggested that the peroxisomal targeting of _PROTEIN_ requires an intact _PROTEIN_ sequence in the cargo protein . we next examined whether there was a direct interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ containing proteins during import using bifc . we constructed a gene chimera encoding _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . when _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were co _PROTEIN_ together with tdtomato _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected in the _LOCATION_ and co localized with tdtomato _PROTEIN_ . these results were in agreement with the model in which receptor cargo complexes composed of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ containing protein and a _PROTEIN_ containing protein are targeted to _LOCATION_ during import . we carefully examined control cells that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ and none of the cells exhibited significant levels of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ which indicated that the reconstitution of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was indeed the result of complex formation between the two fusion proteins . furthermore to show that the _PROTEIN_ of protein is occurring without the reconstitution of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ we transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fused to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ fused to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in leek epidermal cells . as shown in figure _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was then detected in cells with a significant red _METHOD_ signal . to determine whether there were additional _PROTEIN_ required for _PROTEIN_ targeting to the peroxisomal _LOCATION_ we analyzed the subcellular localization of tdtomato _PROTEIN_ in root cells of several arabidopsis pex mutants . it has been reported that mutants with nucleotide substitutions in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are defective in peroxisomal function . these mutants are designated _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . furthermore citation recently reported reduced _PROTEIN_ function in the rnai knock down mutant _PROTEIN_ . in this mutant _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fails to localize properly and accumulates in the _LOCATION_ . we introduced tdtomato _PROTEIN_ into the root cells of wild type arabidopsis and into _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants by particle bombardment . tdtomato _PROTEIN_ localized to the _LOCATION_ in wild type plants consistent with the subcellular localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . in contrast tdtomato _PROTEIN_ localized to the _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . these results indicated that the loss of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ prevents the targeting of _PROTEIN_ to _LOCATION_ . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ directly interacted with _PROTEIN_ in vivo we carried out a bifc assay using _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ a fusion protein of _PROTEIN_ and the c terminal half of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in leek epidermal cells resulted in punctate _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signals in the _LOCATION_ . the _METHOD_ specific spherical structures co localized with tdtomato _PROTEIN_ which suggested that the interaction of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ occurred at the _LOCATION_ . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complex was most likely localized to the peroxisomal _LOCATION_ as _PROTEIN_ is a peroxisomal _LOCATION_ protein . these results provide experimental evidence of a novel direct protein protein interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in plant cells . to confirm the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as shown by bifc the yeast two hybrid system was employed . _PROTEIN_ contains two _LOCATION_ spanning domains so we thought that it was difficult to use the full length _PROTEIN_ for the two hybrid assay as was the case with _PROTEIN_ . accordingly the truncated constructs with the n terminal amino acids _PROTEIN_ or the c terminal amino acids _PROTEIN_ were generated . _PROTEIN_ interacted with _PROTEIN_ but did not interact with _PROTEIN_ . with _PROTEIN_ to the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was able to interact with both the wild type and mutated versions of _PROTEIN_ . these data confirmed that _PROTEIN_ was capable of binding with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and the interaction was detected by bifc . in addition bifc is a useful technique for detecting the interaction between peroxisomal proteins .
