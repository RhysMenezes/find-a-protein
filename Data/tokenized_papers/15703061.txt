the recessive arabidopsis thalianafumonisin _PROTEIN_ resistant _PROTEIN_ mutant was identified by its ability to survive in the presence of a programmed cell death inducing fungal toxin _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ mutant also displays altered plant architecture in the absence of _PROTEIN_ most notably elongated petioles and enhanced leaf margin serration . these phenotypes are a result of a t dna insertion in the squamosa promoter binding protein domain gene _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ encodes a plant specific protein with features characteristic of a transcriptional regulator including a _LOCATION_ localization signal sequence a plant specific dna binding domain and a protein interaction motif . a transiently _PROTEIN_ fusion of the _PROTEIN_ protein to green _METHOD_ protein is directed to the plant _LOCATION_ . dna sequences immediately upstream of the translation start site direct _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ reporter gene primarily in the vascular tissues consistent with the phenotypes of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . _PROTEIN_ activates transcription in yeast with a transactivation domain residing within the n terminal region of the protein . recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein binds a. thaliana genomic dna in vitro in the absence of other proteins . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ functions as a transcriptional regulator that plays a role not only in sensitivity to _PROTEIN_ but also in the development of normal plant architecture .
