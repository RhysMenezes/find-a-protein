_LOCATION_ participate in many important functions in plants including seed reserve mobilization photorespiration defense against oxidative stress and auxin and jasmonate signaling . in mammals defects in _LOCATION_ biogenesis result in multiple system abnormalities severe developmental delay and death whereas in unicellular yeasts _LOCATION_ are dispensable unless required for growth of specific substrates . _PROTEIN_ encodes an integral _LOCATION_ protein required for _LOCATION_ biogenesis in mammals and yeast . to investigate the importance of _PROTEIN_ in plants we characterized a ds insertion mutant in the _PROTEIN_ gene of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ . heterozygous _PROTEIN_ dissociation element mutants show normal vegetative phenotypes under optimal growth conditions but produce about abnormal seeds . the embryos in the abnormal seeds are predominantly homozygous for the disruption allele . they show retarded development and some morphological abnormalities . no viable homozygous mutant plants were obtained . _PROTEIN_ fused to yellow _METHOD_ protein colocalized with green _METHOD_ protein serine lysine leucine a well documented peroxisomal marker suggesting that _PROTEIN_ encodes a peroxisomal protein that is essential for normal embryo development and viability .
previously we have isolated a cdna encoding a protein with to sequence similarity to the product of the _PROTEIN_ gene from mammals and fungi and we have shown that it is encoded by a single genomic locus _GENE_ . to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ is a true ortholog of the _PROTEIN_ gene of mammals and fungi we examined its subcellular localization by fusing it to the yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ transiently in tobacco leaf epidermal cells and was visualized using confocal microscopy . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ located to punctate spherical structures similar in size to plant _LOCATION_ . low laser settings of the microscope allowed us to identify the distribution of the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ toward the rim of some of these spherical structures _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . tobacco leaf _LOCATION_ generally contain catalase crystals which may explain the pattern of _METHOD_ . these structures showed distinct behaviors being stationary or moving over a few microns or more all of which are characteristic of _LOCATION_ movement in arabidopsis and onion . to investigate the nature of the structures highlighted by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ we transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaf epidermal cells a green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fused to the c terminal tripeptide ser lys leu a common signal sequence for peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ proteins . a _METHOD_ skl fusion has already been used in arabidopsis and onion as an in vivo marker for _LOCATION_ . in leaf epidermal cells _METHOD_ skl _METHOD_ highlighted spherical structures similar to those visualized with a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion . to confirm the identity of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ structures with _LOCATION_ we cotransformed tobacco leaf epidermal cells with cultures of a. tumefaciens containing binary vectors _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ skl . confocal observation of cells coexpressing both constructs revealed colocalization of _METHOD_ due to _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with _METHOD_ skl . similar results were also obtained when the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct was transiently _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis plants that had been stably transformed with a peroxisomal targeted _METHOD_ . these results allowed us to conclude that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion localizes to _LOCATION_ . the tissue _PROTEIN_ profile of _PROTEIN_ was determined by reverse transcriptase pcr . total rna was extracted from green leaves senescent leaves roots siliques _METHOD_ and flowers and was reverse transcribed and amplified with _PROTEIN_ gene specific primers and . _PROTEIN_ transcript was detected in all tissues tested . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was also detected in seedlings by northern blotting with maximal _PROTEIN_ occurring at d and after imbibition . this is in good agreement with the _PROTEIN_ profile of other pex genes from arabidopsis . a potential ds insertion mutant in _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ was reported among a population of sequenced insertion sites . seed from this line _PROTEIN_ were ordered and selected on kanamycin . the site of insertion was confirmed by sequencing pcr products amplified from genomic dna from plants using _PROTEIN_ and ds specific primers . the ds insert in _PROTEIN_ is located in exon four bp downstream of the _PROTEIN_ and is in the opposite orientation to the _PROTEIN_ gene . this orientation should result in an _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transcriptional fusion as the ds element carries a gus gene trap with splice acceptor and donor sites in all three reading frames . unfortunately no gus activity could be detected in any tissues tested . the ds insertion is predicted to result in a severely truncated protein that lacks the _PROTEIN_ domain and both predicted transmembrane domains . therefore it is unlikely that the truncated protein will be correctly inserted into the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . southern blot analysis of the _PROTEIN_ line showed a single ds insertion within the genome in _PROTEIN_ . three hundred and fifty five seeds from a selfed heterozygous _PROTEIN_ plant selected on kanamycin resulted in kanamycin resistant and kanamycin sensitive seedlings . therefore the ratio of kanamycin resistant to sensitive seed approximates instead of the ratio expected for the segregation of a single dominant marker . forty progeny from two selfed heterozygous plants were genotyped by pcr . examples of seven individuals are shown along with a wild type control . in total wild type and heterozygous plants were obtained . no _PROTEIN_ plants homozygous for the _PROTEIN_ allele containing the ds insert were present in the plants analyzed . peroxisomal oxidation is an essential metabolic pathway . it produces the energy and _PROTEIN_ skeletons required for seedling establishment by mobilizing stored lipids in the seed . a number of oxidation mutants require suc for seedling establishment . to determine whether homozygous mutant plants simply fail to germinate seed from a selfed heterozygous _PROTEIN_ plant were compared with wild type for differences in germination levels in the presence and absence of suc . no significant differences were found between wild type and seed from the heterozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant in the presence or absence of suc . establishment defined as the ability to produce true foliage leaves within d of plating was also tested . the percentage of seedlings establishing without suc from a selfed heterozygote was low but not significantly different compared with wild type . therefore the lack of homozygous mutant plants can not be explained by failure to germinate or establish in the absence of suc . heterozygous plants grew normally and did not differ in appearance from wild type plants grown along side them . similarly transmission electron micrographs of transverse sections through mesophyll cells treated with a peroxisomal cytochemical stain diaminobenzidine revealed no obvious difference in the ultrastructure of cotyledon cells of heterozygous _PROTEIN_ and wild type seedlings . additionally the morphology of the _LOCATION_ mitochondria and chloroplasts appear unaltered from wild type and are all closely associated . heterozygote and wild type seedlings showed similar sensitivity to dichlorophenoxybutyric acid a herbicide that is bioactivated by peroxisomal oxidation and inhibits root growth suggesting that the heterozygous mutants have no detectable defect in oxidation . developing seed from three heterozygous and one wild type selfed plant were analyzed . during arabidopsis seed development the external appearance of the immature seed changes from white to green and then browns before seed release . immature seed within a single silique develop at approximately the same rate therefore abnormal seed appear white or brown and shriveled in comparison with normal green developing seed . ten siliques were removed from each plant and the developing seeds were removed and scored for abnormalities in external morphology . approximately seeds per plant were counted . the average frequency of abnormal seeds per silique for a heterozygous plant was whereas only of seed from siliques from wild type plants were abnormal . the levels of abnormal seed seen in the three heterozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant plants were found to be significantly different from wild type levels at the level of significance . as no homozygous _PROTEIN_ plants were identified in pcr genotype screens and the segregation of wild type to heterozygous plants was it seemed likely that the missing homozygous mutants might be found among the embryos in the abnormal seed . seeds were classified as normal or abnormal on the basis of morphological appearance and the embryos cleanly dissected away from the surrounding endosperm tissue . single embryo pcr was carried out with two primer pairs _PROTEIN_ and and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . results from four morphologically abnormal embryos and four normal embryos are shown in figure . all of the abnormal embryos contain only the disruption allele demonstrating that they are homozygous for the _PROTEIN_ gene . one of the normal embryos contains only the wild type allele specific band of bp whereas the remaining three contain bp and kbp bands and are therefore heterozygous . forty embryos were genotyped in total classified as morphologically abnormal and nine as normal . twenty nine of the abnormal embryos were homozygous mutants the remaining two were heterozygotes . of the nine embryos that appeared normal three were wild type four were heterozygotes and two were homozygous mutants . these results indicated that a large proportion of the homozygous mutant population are morphologically abnormal although the presence of two homozygous mutants among the morphologically normal embryos suggest that some may develop further than others . however the results from germination tests and genotyping adult plants indicate that these embryos do not give rise to viable seed . to investigate the developmental abnormalities associated with the homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutation developing seeds were examined by light microscopy using normarski optics . developing seeds from siliques from selfed heterozygous _PROTEIN_ plants were removed . morphologically abnormal seeds were compared with seeds of normal appearance from the same silique . in all cases abnormal embryos were at an earlier developmental stage than the normal embryos from the same silique . figure shows an embryo from a normal seed at the torpedo stage of development whereas figure shows an abnormal embryo from the same silique at the earlier globular stage normally seen around d after flowering . figure shows a normal embryo from a different silique at the curled cotyledon stage whereas abnormal embryos from this silique and staged siliques from the same time point ranged from globular to heart stages . these and further observations from staged siliques demonstrate that the abnormal embryos do not arrest at a single developmental time point but appear to develop more slowly and eventually abort . genotyping of embryos by pcr indicated that some homozygous mutant embryos could develop at least as far as the torpedo stage . seed containing embryos at the torpedo stage of development begin to green . embryos from green seed were removed and genotyped but their developmental stage was not recorded and could therefore have been more advanced than the torpedo stage . this result suggests that the phenotype of _PROTEIN_ homozygous mutants should be classified as variable using the classification of mcelver et al . . some evidence of developmental abnormalities was seen in some embryos . comparison between figure e and g indicates figure is an enlarged globular stage embryo . similar comparison between figure f and h indicates the embryo in figure is an enlarged heart stage embryo . additional observations made during dissection of embryos from their seed coat for pcr analysis indicated some also displayed unevenly sized cotyledons . enlarged or abnormal embryos are a fairly common occurrence in embryo lethal mutants for example _PROTEIN_ defective in a _LOCATION_ acetyl coa _PROTEIN_ . likewise a homozygous insertion in _PROTEIN_ a cellulose synthase like putative glycosyl transferase was embryo lethal and resulted in slower development compared with wild type . wild type developing seeds were studied to determine whether _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ early in embryogenesis occurred . total rna was extracted from whole wild type seed containing embryos at the early globular stage of development . rtpcr with _PROTEIN_ specific primers followed by southern blotting with an _PROTEIN_ specific probe showed that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ at this developmental stage . this is consistent with a lack of _PROTEIN_ leading to defects in development . to determine whether abnormal embryos still had _LOCATION_ cleanly dissected embryos at the heart torpedo stage were fixed and embedded for electron microscopy . no _LOCATION_ could be identified even after cytochemical staining with diaminobenzidine . however the cellular ultrastructure was highly abnormal . in some cases _LOCATION_ were visible with prominent nucleoli . the _LOCATION_ were clearly surrounded by a double _LOCATION_ but this was highly distended with gaps of up to between the two _LOCATION_ . the cytoplasm was packed with heterogeneous vesicles and no other organelles could be identified with confidence . it seemed likely that these cells were dying and no conclusions could be drawn about the presence or absence of _LOCATION_ . plants heterozygous for the _PROTEIN_ disruption allele were transformed with a wild type genomic copy of _PROTEIN_ . two plants resistant to hygromycin the selectable marker for the transgene were recovered . pcr analysis indicated that they were transformed heterozygous individuals . to determine whether the _PROTEIN_ transgene complemented the embryo lethal phenotype two criteria were tested . the first criterion was to test whether the levels of aborted seed were reduced to that expected for complemented plants and the second criterion was whether homozygous plants could be grown from the complemented seeds . the former was tested by dissecting siliques from and self fertilized plants and scoring for the number of abnormal versus normal seeds . the percentage of abnormal seeds per silique was determined and the average of siliques was taken . results indicate that the levels of abnormal seeds per silique from selfed and plants is similar to that expected for complemented plants carrying one or two copies of the transgene respectively . seeds harvested from self fertilized and plants were selected on kanamycin and the resistant progeny were genotyped . genomic dna extracted from the resistant progeny was amplified with primers specific for the transgene or for the chromosomal copy of _PROTEIN_ . out of the eight plants tested two lacked the chromosomal copy of _PROTEIN_ and were kanamycin resistant . these two individuals are homozygous for the ds insertion allele . therefore the embryo lethal phenotype can be complemented by the _PROTEIN_ gene giving rise to adult plants .
seeds were imbibed and germinated on murashige and skoog salts plant agar with kanamycin or hygromycin selection where specified or suc . _PROTEIN_ and amphotericin b were included in all seedling media except for selection with hygromycin . seedlings were carefully removed from tissue culture planted in compost and kept under propagators in short day conditions . propagators were removed after approximately week and the plants were kept in short day conditions for around to weeks or until flowering was required . after this time the plants were transferred to long day growth conditions .

restriction sites . the _METHOD_ fragment was amplified with the following oligonucleotides forward strand _PROTEIN_ reverse strand ctagagctcacttgtacagctcgtccat . the ends of the oligomers contain
