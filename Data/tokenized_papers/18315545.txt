four genes of arabidopsis encoding no conservative region other than an spx domain were named _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the various subcellular localizations of their _METHOD_ fusion proteins implied function variations for the four genes . phosphate starvation strongly induced _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with distinct dynamic patterns while _PROTEIN_ was weakly induced and _PROTEIN_ was suppressed . _PROTEIN_ of the four atspx genes was reduced to different extents in the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants under phosphate starvation indicating that they are part of the phosphate signaling network that involves _PROTEIN_ . over _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ increased the transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ under both phosphate sufficient and phosphate deficient conditions suggesting a potential transcriptional regulation role of _PROTEIN_ in response to phosphate starvation . partial repression of _PROTEIN_ by rna interference led to aggravated phosphate deficiency _METHOD_ altered p allocation and enhanced _PROTEIN_ of a subset od phosphate responsive genes including _PROTEIN_ . our results indicate that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ play positive roles in plant _PROTEIN_ to phosphate starvation and _PROTEIN_ may have a negative feedback regulatory role in _PROTEIN_ response to phosphate starvation .
the four atspx genes encoding no conserved region except for a spx domain are referred to as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the atspx genes all have three exons and two introns . the position and size of the three exons are fairly well conserved with the spx coding region _PROTEIN_ spanning the first two exons . pairwise comparison reveals that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ share more structural features while _PROTEIN_ is similar to _PROTEIN_ . the spx domain in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ spans the first two exons to the end of the third exon . thus the greatest divergence in the structure of the four genes is the relative lengths of the intron and exon ranges spanned by the spx domain . their deduced proteins are similar lengths with similarity . analysis of their tripartite spx domain revealed similarity of amino acids in the entire spx domain but > in each sub domain with the third sub domain being the most conserved . representative genes that are homologous to the atspx genes are shown in figure and their amino acid sequence alignment analysis is shown in figure . _PROTEIN_ are more homologous to spx genes from other plant species that to other arabidopsis spx genes . no signal peptide has been predicted for the deduced atspx proteins except for a bipartite _LOCATION_ targeting sequence krlkligsktadrpvkr from amino acids in _PROTEIN_ . c terminal _METHOD_ fusions driven by camv were used for visualization of atspx localization . _PROTEIN_ clones were transformed into onion epidermal cells for transient assay . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were localized exclusively to the _LOCATION_ while _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was detected in regions that included the cytoplasmic _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was present in onion cells as many _METHOD_ speckles in the cytoplasm . the _LOCATION_ localized _METHOD_ plasmid pcamb _METHOD_ was co transformed into onion cells with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plasmid and partial overlapping of green and red _METHOD_ was observed . transgenic arabidopsis materials were subsequently generated for the atspx _METHOD_ fusion proteins . stable _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in arabidopsis roots was localized to the same cellular location as in the transient assay . _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was found in the cytoplasmic _LOCATION_ and weak signals were observed in some intercellular membranous _METHOD_ . there was no obvious green _METHOD_ in transgenic seedlings harboring _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs . therefore a transient _PROTEIN_ assay was performed in arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized to the _LOCATION_ in arabidopsis protoplasts as for onion cells consistent with the prediction by prosite . _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ partially overlapped with the auto _METHOD_ of chlorophyll in the mesophyll protoplasts . _PROTEIN_ may be localized in intercellular membranous particles including microbodies and chloroplasts . to study the _PROTEIN_ profiles of the atspx genes the kb utr region for each gene was amplified _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and fused to _PROTEIN_ in and then transformed into arabidopsis . continuous gus staining in young seedlings from germination revealed varied patterns . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ showed strong staining in cotyledons and hypocotyls while _PROTEIN_ showed moderate staining in radicles . _PROTEIN_ showed no activity during early germination and the first staining observed was in hypocotyls days after germination . the full opening of cotyledons was followed by _PROTEIN_ promoter activity in cotyledons and radicles but increased in hypocotyls for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ there was obvious staining for _PROTEIN_ in leaf veins preferentially in the abaxial region of leaf blades and also in the branching regions of primary and _PROTEIN_ roots . _PROTEIN_ was active in cotyledons and roots on appearance of the first leaf . _PROTEIN_ gus staining was only observed in leaf veins and shoot apical _METHOD_ but not in root _METHOD_ under optimal nutrition . _PROTEIN_ activity was high in shoot apical _METHOD_ and weak in _PROTEIN_ root initiation regions . in mature plants _PROTEIN_ gus staining was observed in rosette leaves and cauline leaves . _PROTEIN_ gus activity was not found in leaves but was seen in _METHOD_ at branching of axillary shoots . staining for _PROTEIN_ gus was only observed in the abaxial region of the leaf blade . _PROTEIN_ activity was evident in the _PROTEIN_ vein of rosette leaves . all promoters uniformly displayed activity in mature pollen grains and the staining intensity was consistent with pollen activity following _PROTEIN_ unfolding . control plants transformed by without insertions showed weak gus staining in the base of pistils young siliques and flower stalks . to study the response of the atspx genes to pi starvation transgenic seeds harboring promoter gus fusions were germinated on media with various pi concentrations . pi starvation enhanced the _PROTEIN_ of all atspxp gus fusions except _PROTEIN_ gus . _PROTEIN_ activity was rapidly induced by pi starvation with detectable promotion at dag and to an even higher degree at dag . there were detectable increases in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ activities at dag and _PROTEIN_ was most highly induced at dag . quantitative rt pcr was subsequently performed . pi starvation for day markedly increased _PROTEIN_ transcript abundance especially in roots . pi starvation for days led to notable _PROTEIN_ enhancement of _PROTEIN_ with higher levels in roots than shoots . re supply of pi for day quickly _PROTEIN_ their abundance especially of _PROTEIN_ in roots . in contrast pi starvation for day reduced the level of _PROTEIN_ transcript to half that before treatment . prolonged pi deficiency did not affect _PROTEIN_ transcription further but re supply of pi for day resulted in complete recovery . the results of semi quantitative rt pcr distinguished _PROTEIN_ from _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was induced by one week starvation on pi and _PROTEIN_ was induced by one week on pi . _PROTEIN_ also responded more rapidly with distinctly increased transcript levels after h pi starvation while there was an obvious increase in _PROTEIN_ transcripts only after days of pi starvation . for functional characterization generation of over _PROTEIN_ materials for the atspx genes was paralleled by isolation of mutants or rnai materials . _PROTEIN_ of the pi starvation inducible genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was enhanced in _PROTEIN_ over _PROTEIN_ plants relative to the wild type . this _PROTEIN_ enhancement was more significant under pi sufficiency than under pi deficiency . the fold increased _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was paralleled by similar elevations of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in shoots and a greater increase of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in roots under pi sufficiency . under pi starvation _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was not so obviously changed but the other three genes were clearly upregulated in shoots and the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was clearly increased in roots . together these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ may be actively involved in pi signaling pathways by regulating the _PROTEIN_ of the pi responsive genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the t dna insertion mutants and corresponding to interruption of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively were obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center and propagated and validated for exact genome insertion and complete _PROTEIN_ deletion . there were no obvious phenotypes for these mutants under either pi sufficiency or deficiency . because a t dna insertion mutant of _PROTEIN_ was not available an rnai strategy was adopted and two _PROTEIN_ repressed lines were developed . the _PROTEIN_ rnai plants presented no detectable phenotype under pi _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were not significantly affected in _PROTEIN_ repressed lines under pi sufficiency suggesting specific interference on _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ repressed lines showed lowered plant tolerance to pi starvation including reduced root _METHOD_ and impaired aerial parts . the primary root elongation in _PROTEIN_ repressed lines was much reduced by pi starvation compared to wt . the concentration of p in the wt and _PROTEIN_ repressed lines were determined . total p was significantly higher in shoots and lower in roots of the two lines and compared to that in wt . pi concentration increased by > in the shoots of _PROTEIN_ repressed lines compared to wt . the pi level in the roots was unchanged in but increased in . shoots and roots were sampled from day old seedlings . the values represent the means _PROTEIN_ of two independent experiments . asignificant difference in means between wt and transgenic plants . relevant gene _PROTEIN_ was analyzed to further understand the hypersensitive phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ repressed lines . the pi responsive genes examined comprise the _PROTEIN_ family genes _PROTEIN_ and the transporter family the secreted phosphatase _PROTEIN_ gene ribonuclease genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the anthocyanin synthesis regulator _PROTEIN_ gene and the other atspx genes . there were considerable alterations in _PROTEIN_ of the genes . of the transporter family tested only _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ clearly increased in shoots . similarly _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were markedly elevated in shoots of transgenic plants . _PROTEIN_ showed prominent _PROTEIN_ enhancement in roots but a weak increase in shoots . _PROTEIN_ and were upregulated in whole plants more markedly in roots than shoots . to determine whether the spxs are involved in pi signaling pathways we further investigated the _PROTEIN_ of atspx genes in mutants including _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ of all atspx genes under pi starvation was not obviously changed in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but was clearly impaired in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ compared to wt . _PROTEIN_ was markedly repressed in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was downregulated more in _PROTEIN_ than in _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was reduced to about half in _PROTEIN_ with a mild _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was not significantly reduced in _PROTEIN_ but was markedly downregulated to < in _PROTEIN_ . consistent results were obtained for _PROTEIN_ gus staining in wt and _PROTEIN_ strongly suggesting that _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ requires _PROTEIN_ . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ acts downstream of _PROTEIN_ while _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as upstream regulators in pi signaling .
