microtubules are dynamic filaments the assembly and disassembly of which are under precise control of various associated proteins including motor proteins and regulatory enzymes . in arabidopsis thaliana two such proteins are the armadillo _PROTEIN_ kinesin _PROTEIN_ which promotes microtubule disassembly and the nima related kinase _PROTEIN_ which has a role in organizing microtubule arrays . previous yeast two hybrid and in vitro pull down assays determined that _PROTEIN_ can interact with _PROTEIN_ through the latter protein s armadillo repeat cargo domain . to explore the function of the arm domain we generated _METHOD_ reporter fusion proteins to _PROTEIN_ lacking the arm domain _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and to the arm domain alone _METHOD_ . both of these constructs strongly associated with the growing plus ends of microtubules but only _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was capable of inducing microtubule catastrophe and rescuing the _PROTEIN_ root hair phenotype . these results indicate that neither the arm domain nor _PROTEIN_ s putative interaction with it is required for _PROTEIN_ to induce microtubule catastrophe . in further exploration of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ relationship we demonstrated that despite evidence that _PROTEIN_ can phosphorylate _PROTEIN_ in vitro the in vivo distribution and function of _PROTEIN_ were not affected by the loss of _PROTEIN_ and vice versa . moreover _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were found to have overlapping but non identical distribution on microtubules and hormone treatments known to affect _PROTEIN_ activity did not stimulate interaction . these findings suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function independently in microtubule dynamics and cell morphogenesis . despite the results of this functional analysis we found that overexpression of the arm domain led to complete loss of _PROTEIN_ transcription suggesting that the arm domain might have a regulatory role in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ .
our previous work demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ without the arm domain _PROTEIN_ remains bound to microtubules suggesting that the motor domain alone was sufficient for microtubule binding . however in this study the _PROTEIN_ monomeric red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ protein was overexpressed leading to artifactual labeling of the entire microtubule much like what was observed with the full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ reporter driven by the same _PROTEIN_ promoter . because of this artifactual microtubule labeling we were unable to characterize fully the motor domain of _PROTEIN_ . in order to elucidate the function of the motor domain further we generated a translational reporter of _PROTEIN_ lacking the arm domain _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ driven by the _PROTEIN_ promoter . this construct was transformed into an _PROTEIN_ line _PROTEIN_ mcherry to enable microtubules to be viewed along with the truncated _PROTEIN_ . images were collected using variable angle total internal reflection _METHOD_ microscopy _PROTEIN_ . in contrast to our prediction that _PROTEIN_ should lose function without its c terminal arm domain the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct was able to rescue the _PROTEIN_ root hair phenotype . moreover _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ displayed the same plus end microtubule distribution pattern as full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and tracked the growing plus ends of microtubules at similar velocities to the full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in addition the microtubule plus end catastrophe frequencies of plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed no significant difference _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . based on these data we conclude that _PROTEIN_ is fully functional as a catastrophe _PROTEIN_ without the arm domain and that the motor domain may confer microtubule plus end tracking and microtubule catastrophe . having discovered that _PROTEIN_ is functional as a catastrophe _PROTEIN_ without its arm domain we sought to determine the function of the arm domain . an _PROTEIN_ arm _METHOD_ construct was transformed into _PROTEIN_ mcherry plants and images were acquired with spinning disk confocal microscopy . arm _METHOD_ specifically localized to growing microtubule plus ends similar to the plus end binding protein _PROTEIN_ . in some cells _METHOD_ appeared to accumulate in highly connected tubule structures reminiscent of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ suggesting instability of the arm _METHOD_ protein . furthermore silencing of arm _METHOD_ also occurred since some cells completely lacked arm _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ arm _METHOD_ construct failed to complement the _PROTEIN_ root hair phenotype consistent with our finding that the arm domain does not contribute to _PROTEIN_ s role in promoting microtubule catastrophe . the arm _METHOD_ s plus end localization suggests that the domain could contribute to _PROTEIN_ s ability to plus end track on microtubules . based on _PROTEIN_ s ability to interact with _PROTEIN_ we hypothesized that _PROTEIN_ also phosphorylates _PROTEIN_ . to address this we _PROTEIN_ the n terminal motor domain of _PROTEIN_ and full length _PROTEIN_ proteins in escherichia coli and purified them for use in an in vitro kinase assay . our data showed that _PROTEIN_ was phosphorylated in the presence of _PROTEIN_ . furthermore we found that _PROTEIN_ itself was phosphorylated and that the amount of phosphorylation was negatively correlated with _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation levels and _PROTEIN_ protein concentration . as a positive control _PROTEIN_ was also incubated with the tubulin isoform _PROTEIN_ protein . we noted that as with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation was also negatively correlated with _PROTEIN_ protein concentration and phosphorylation levels . taken together our data reveal that in addition to phosphorylating _PROTEIN_ as previously described _PROTEIN_ phosphorylates itself and _PROTEIN_ further confirming a physical interaction in vitro and suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interact both physically and functionally in vivo . to determine if _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ influence each other s association with microtubules we examined the distribution patterns of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ mutants and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ mutants . we first hypothesized that if _PROTEIN_ can interact with the arm domain of _PROTEIN_ the association of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with microtubules should be altered in root hairs of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . we examined _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ distribution in root hairs where _PROTEIN_ is exclusively _PROTEIN_ as well as in hypocotyl and non root hair forming epidermal cells in which _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ distribution appeared no different between the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ backgrounds . in both genotypes _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ had an uneven and patchy microtubule distribution and more importantly displayed similar movements on microtubules . finally the _PROTEIN_ epidermal cell protrusion phenotype remained complemented by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ background which indicates that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is functional without _PROTEIN_ . the absence of any changes in _PROTEIN_ distribution in the _PROTEIN_ background could have resulted from _PROTEIN_ functional redundancy with its homologs _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which are also _PROTEIN_ in hypocotyls and petioles _PROTEIN_ and leaf tissue _PROTEIN_ . we considered the possibility that _PROTEIN_ and/or _PROTEIN_ might compensate for the lack of _PROTEIN_ thus leading to unchanged _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ microtubule labeling in the _PROTEIN_ background . to test this we visualized _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in an _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutant and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ quadruple mutant . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ s localization to microtubules was unchanged . taken together our observations demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ s microtubule localization and function do not require any of the three arks . to test whether _PROTEIN_ s function and distribution on microtubules depend on _PROTEIN_ we examined the distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant a t dna insertion line that is devoid of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we found that in _PROTEIN_ root hairs _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized to both cortical and _LOCATION_ microtubules . furthermore _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ rescued the _PROTEIN_ root hair phenotype in the _PROTEIN_ background suggesting that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is functional in the absence of _PROTEIN_ . because _PROTEIN_ mutants have protruding hypocotyl and petiole epidermal cells we examined _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ distribution in these cell types . as in the wild type hypocotyl cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ remained at the plus ends of microtubules in the _PROTEIN_ hypocotyls . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ s distribution and function are independent of _PROTEIN_ . furthermore because _PROTEIN_ s kinase activity is abolished in _PROTEIN_ knock out lines we conclude that _PROTEIN_ s function and microtubule association do not require _PROTEIN_ dependent phosphorylation . taken together the above experiments suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are mutually independent with respect to function and distribution under normal growth conditions . nevertheless it remains possible that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function within the same genetic pathway to influence microtubule dynamics and cell elongation . epidermal protrusions in _PROTEIN_ mutants were previously reported to be suppressed in dark grown plants . we therefore generated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants and tested whether the _PROTEIN_ mutation could enhance the _PROTEIN_ epidermal protrusion phenotype in hypocotyls and petioles of both light and dark grown plants . in light grown hypocotyls the number of epidermal protrusions was not significantly different between the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants and the _PROTEIN_ single mutants . in dark grown _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants epidermal protrusions did not form and were similarly absent in both light and dark grown wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function independently in the regulation of cell elongation and microtubule dynamics . based on the lack of evidence for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ functional interaction under normal experimental conditions we considered the possibility that interactions only occur under extreme conditions in which rapid growth is stimulated or growth is inhibited . the number of protruding cells in _PROTEIN_ mutants can be reduced by exposure to gibberellic acid and increased by exposure to the ethylene precursor aminocyclopropane _PROTEIN_ acid . in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and ethylene/acc are predicted to function in a negative feedback loop with acc inducing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ overexpression leading to reductions in the _PROTEIN_ of ethylene related genes and ethylene biosynthesis . we therefore hypothesized that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction can be stimulated by exposure to gibberellic acid or acc . to test this we developed an experimental line co _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in an _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant background . in contrast to the growing microtubule plus end distribution pattern of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was found along the full length of microtubules and remained associated with microtubules during growth and shrinkage . despite this unusual distribution pattern _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ rescued the _PROTEIN_ root hair phenotype indicating that the protein was fully functional . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ had a patchy distribution along microtubules in mock treatments . upon exposure to acc or gibberellic acid the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ distribution patterns remained indistinguishable from the mock treatments . this observation indicates that neither gibberellic acid nor acc stimulates or alters _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction . we next hypothesized that _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ function/localization may be altered in either the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ background respectively when exposed to exogenous gibberellic acid or acc . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the _PROTEIN_ background showed no changes with gibberellic acid and acc . similarly the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the _PROTEIN_ background remained microtubule plus end localized in acc and gibberellic acid treatments . in summary despite their effects on the _PROTEIN_ cell protrusion phenotype acc and gibberellic acid treatments did not reveal any evidence for interactions between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in a previous study overexpressing arm _METHOD_ using the _PROTEIN_ promoter resulted in labeling along the full length of microtubules . in a final attempt to detect a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in vivo interaction we transformed the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line with the high _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ arm _METHOD_ construct to see if the arm _METHOD_ distribution along the full length of microtubules would alter the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ distribution pattern . of independent _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ arm _METHOD_ transgenic lines recovered all lines positive for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lacked arm _METHOD_ signal . the remaining two transgenic lines showed arm _METHOD_ along the entire length of the microtubule but in both cases _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was undetectable either on microtubules or within the cytoplasm . to determine if the lack of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ resulted from absent _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in plants overexpressing arm _METHOD_ we conducted reverse transcription pcr using _METHOD_ specific primers . in the two transgenic lines overexpressing arm _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was absent suggesting transcriptional inhibition of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . conversely and as expected _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transcript was detected in the transgenic lines that lacked arm _METHOD_ but had _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the two lines lacking _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were confirmed to carry the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene by genotyping with _METHOD_ specific primers . given these unexpected results we hypothesized that the arm domains of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ can act as negative regulators of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to test this we measured the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transcript levels in the absence of _PROTEIN_ under the assumption that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ should increase without any of the arks suppressing its _PROTEIN_ . with quantitative real time pcr we found that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ level in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ background was fold higher relative to the complemented _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ background . our results therefore suggest that the arm domain of the ark proteins is a negative regulator of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ .
