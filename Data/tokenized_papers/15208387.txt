_LOCATION_ have evolved from an endosymbiosis between a cyanobacterial symbiont and a eukaryotic host cell . their division is mediated both by proteins of the host cell and conserved bacterial division proteins . here we identified a new component of the _LOCATION_ division machinery arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ . disruption of its cyanobacterial homolog in synechocystis and overexpression of an _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein fusion in arabidopsis demonstrate that these genes are involved in cell and _LOCATION_ division respectively . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ inhibits _LOCATION_ division in planta but rescues _LOCATION_ division defects caused by overexpression of and demonstrating that its role in _LOCATION_ division may involve an interaction with and .
a bioinformatic search for cell cycle inhibitors drew our interest to _GENE_ . the corresponding protein shares similarities with several bacterial and cyanobacterial proteins annotated as cell division inhibitors homologous to the e. coli cell division inhibitor _PROTEIN_ . this gene was therefore named _PROTEIN_ . it is a unique gene in arabidopsis conserved in many plant species . the _PROTEIN_ protein shows identity with the protein of synechocystis . some amino acids are conserved between _PROTEIN_ and the e. coli _PROTEIN_ protein or the recently crystallized pseudomonas aeruginosa _PROTEIN_ protein . _PROTEIN_ is amino acids long and shows a amino acid extension in its n terminal region when compared with its cyanobacterial homolog . bioinformatic analyses using two different _METHOD_ that detect transit peptide sequences strongly suggest that _PROTEIN_ is targeted to _LOCATION_ . altogether homology with the e. coli _PROTEIN_ protein and presence of this putative chloroplast targeting sequence are compatible with a role of _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ division . evolutionary and functional relationships between _LOCATION_ and prokaryotic cell division together with the cyanobacterial origin of _LOCATION_ led us first to examine the function of the synechocystis homolog of _PROTEIN_ . synechocystis is particularly adequate as a model organism because disruption of defined genes can be achieved by homologous recombination . wild type synechocystis were transformed with a deletion cassette containing the flanking regions of ssula where the coding sequence was replaced by the nptii gene conferring kanamycin resistance . two to twelve kmr clones were obtained for each of three different experiments . in these clones replacement of ssula by nptii was assayed by pcr . because synechocystis contains copies of its chromosome two pcrs were performed one to check that the kmr gene was targeted to the proper locus and one to determine whether the cells still contained wild type copies of the gene . indeed all the analyzed clones were and attempts to obtain full disruption of ssula by growing the clones on higher doses of km failed showing that ssula is crucial to cell survival in cyanobacteria . microscopic observations of five different clones showed that between and of the cells were clustered by four in cloverleaf like structures revealing severe cytokinesis defects . by contrast wild type cells were always isolated or clustered by two during division . the mutants could initiate division but were unable to complete cytokinesis daughter cells remained attached and upon initiation of a second round of division cloverleaf like structures were produced . moreover after a few days the clustered cells bleached and died confirming that disruption of ssula causes not only cell division defects but also cell death . thus we conclude that ssula truly operates in cell division and is essential to cell viability . the abundance of _PROTEIN_ mrna in several organs was monitored by rt pcr and compared with that of _LOCATION_ division genes . as shown in figure the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ differs little between the different organs except in the roots where almost no mrna could be detected . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ show similar _PROTEIN_ patterns . to determine the function of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants were generated . to avoid the strong _METHOD_ of chlorophyll root cells of transgenic plants were observed using _METHOD_ and confocal microscopy . as previously shown by transient _PROTEIN_ experiments the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein was imported into _LOCATION_ in planta . only transgenic plants that displayed green _METHOD_ leucoplasts were further studied . not all root cells _PROTEIN_ the label but in some of these cells giant _LOCATION_ could be observed . five independent lines were sorted on the basis of _METHOD_ labeling in the roots . the proportion of plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ varied from to per line . after d in the greenhouse the size and number of chloroplasts were observed in isolated leaf cells of these plants and compared with mesophyll and bundle sheath cells of control plants grown under the same conditions . the proportion of plants showing _LOCATION_ division defects in each line varied between and . in addition plants from a same line were not affected to the same extent . amongst all the observed plants contained an average of chloroplasts in their mesophyll cells like the wild type five had to and had to two of which had only one chloroplast in some cells . inhibition of _LOCATION_ division was not restricted to a cell type being observed in mesophyll cells bundle sheath cells and root cells . _LOCATION_ division defects caused by overexpression of _PROTEIN_ in various cell types suggest that this protein is involved in _LOCATION_ division . distribution of the plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ in the various phenotype categories surprisingly the same leaf could contain a mixed population of mesophyll cells some with apparently normal _LOCATION_ division and some containing a few enlarged _LOCATION_ . the proportion of affected cells within one plant varied from to . in wild type plants mesophyll cells containing such an abnormal number of _LOCATION_ were never observed . moreover _LOCATION_ size could vary dramatically within one cell such a phenomenon was observed in of the analyzed plants . altogether the proportion of _METHOD_ positive _METHOD_ transgenic plants that displayed _LOCATION_ division defects was . amongst the observed plants none had a homogeneous phenotype . similar observations were made in plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ with no _METHOD_ fusion except that the proportion of plants with a phenotype was lower because they could not be sorted on the basis of green _METHOD_ . this demonstrates that the inconsistency of the phenotype was not because of an impairment of _PROTEIN_ activity by the _METHOD_ fusion . taken together these results show that _PROTEIN_ plays a role in _LOCATION_ division . however its overexpression does not seem to alter _LOCATION_ division in the same way in all cells or in all _LOCATION_ . to determine if the heterogeneity of the phenotypes observed amongst the _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants was specific to the _PROTEIN_ protein or could be more general we analyzed plants overexpressing the previously described and . it has previously been reported that overexpression of either or results in a dominant negative effect causing severe _LOCATION_ division defects . in these experiments _LOCATION_ division was more or less severely affected in the different lines . indeed of the plants were similar to the wild type whereas could contain as few as a single greatly enlarged _LOCATION_ in mesophyll cells and had an intermediate phenotype . these authors have shown that the severity of _LOCATION_ division defects correlates with the protein abundance . however heterogeneity between the cells of one plant was not reported possibly because the phenotypes were not analyzed throughout plant development . we generated and plants . three independent lines were analyzed for both and . we observed more or less severe inhibition of _LOCATION_ division in the transgenic plants consistent with previous results . figure shows control cells and cells displaying little or no _LOCATION_ division defects intermediate phenotypes or very severe phenotypes . the proportion of severely affected plants was much lower than previously reported . moreover one cell could contain _LOCATION_ of very different sizes . this phenomenon occurred both in bundle sheath cells and in mesophyll cells in of the plants . thus because of overexpression of either or _LOCATION_ division within one cell could be differentially inhibited and two mesophyll cells of the same leaf could display very different _LOCATION_ numbers . this is especially clear in figure and could never be observed in the wild type . interestingly the distribution of plants in the various phenotype categories was similar to that obtained for _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants . observation of other cell types such as _PROTEIN_ cells or stomatal guard cells led to the same conclusion . only a small minority of the plants with extreme _LOCATION_ division defects had a homogeneous phenotype . in most of the plants with severe _LOCATION_ division defects mesophyll cells containing as few as one chloroplast could be found amongst a majority of cells containing at least . in addition the phenotype weakened during plant development . indeed very young seedlings were sorted by observation of their cotyledons . at that stage almost all plantlets showed extreme _LOCATION_ division defects _LOCATION_ . however observation of the third leaf at various developmental stages revealed that the phenotype weakened throughout plant and leaf growth . distribution of plants overexpressing or in the various phenotype categories approximately of the plants overexpressing either or were affected in _LOCATION_ division whereas only of the _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants had _LOCATION_ division defects as stated above . moreover severe phenotypes were observed in only of the plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ compared with of the plants overexpressing either atftsz . although the overall effect on _LOCATION_ division was more severe in or plants than in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants overexpression of these three genes gave very similar results namely _LOCATION_ division defects varying from one plant to another and from one cell to another within the same plant . rna gel blot analyses were performed to determine whether the presence or absence of phenotype correlated with the transcription level of the constructs . surprisingly the mrna abundance of _PROTEIN_ was the same in _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ plantlets and was far superior to that observed in control plants . moreover plants showing _LOCATION_ division defects and plants similar to the wild type had similar _PROTEIN_ transcript levels . the same results were obtained with and plants suggesting that mrna level is not involved in the variability of the phenotype . taking advantage of the _METHOD_ fusion a protein gel blot analysis was performed on the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants using anti _METHOD_ antibodies . no signal was observed in the leaves of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants and a very weak signal was detectable in their roots whereas a very strong signal was detected in control plants _PROTEIN_ a tubulin _METHOD_ fusion . thus the overall accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants is very low . moreover the _METHOD_ labeling of root _LOCATION_ varied from one cell to another within a same plant . taken together these results suggest that the heterogenous phenotype is attributable to variable protein accumulation in the cells inhibition of _LOCATION_ division can be observed only in the few cells that accumulate high levels of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ or either atftsz inhibits _LOCATION_ division . moreover in e. coli _PROTEIN_ inhibits ftsz polymerization through direct interaction . yet _PROTEIN_ does not interact with either atftsz protein in the yeast two hybrid system . to determine whether overexpression of _PROTEIN_ can alter the phenotype of plants plants overexpressing both _PROTEIN_ and were generated . as described previously isolated cells from plants were observed . eight plants with severe _LOCATION_ division defects were chosen from the line and retransformed with a _PROTEIN_ construct . to select the retransformed plants the seeds of each plant were harvested individually and sown on medium containing km . a few seeds of each line were also germinated on nonselective medium . because the proportion of kmr plantlets was the plantlets grown on nonselective medium could be assumed not to be retransformed with the _PROTEIN_ construct . after d the phenotypes of kmr plantlets were compared with that of plantlets grown on nonselective medium . for each line isolated cells were prepared from cotyledons of kmr plantlets and plantlets grown on nonselective medium . this allowed us to assess the proportion of wild type like plants amongst the transformed plantlets . whole cotyledons were observed and the plants were considered to be wtl only when none of the cells showed _LOCATION_ division defects . as shown in table the proportion of wtl plants for each line was higher in plants overexpressing together with _PROTEIN_ than in plants overexpressing alone . efficient overexpression of in the wtl plants was monitored by rna gel blot analysis and allowed us to assume that the presence of two promoters did not cause gene silencing in these plants . proportion of wtl plants amongst plantlets overexpressing and _PROTEIN_ or alone to follow overexpression of _PROTEIN_ at the protein level in double transformants the same experiment as above was performed using the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion . moreover we generated plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ together with or . we retransformed plants with _LOCATION_ division defects from the following lines and . rna gel blot analysis revealed that wtl plants overexpressed atftsz and _PROTEIN_ . the phenotypes of double transformants were compared with that of single transformants . microscopy revealed that double transformants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at a much higher frequency than plants transformed with _PROTEIN_ alone . moreover the _METHOD_ labeling was very homogeneous and could be observed in all cells of the double transformants in contrast with the few labeled cells of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ single transformants . _PROTEIN_ of double transformants and single transformants from each line were observed using confocal microscopy . as previously observed overexpression of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ restored a wtl phenotype in most of the plants both in and plants . as shown on figure the proportion of wtl plants was higher in double transformants than in single transformants in each of the four analyzed lines . in addition the rescue of the phenotype correlated with homogeneous _METHOD_ staining in _LOCATION_ .
