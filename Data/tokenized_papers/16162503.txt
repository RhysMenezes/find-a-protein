cyanobacterial and plant genomes encode proteins with some similarity to the folate and biopterin transporters of the trypanosomatid parasite leishmania . the synechocystis gene product and its closest arabidopsis homolog the _GENE_ gene product are representative examples . both have probable transmembrane domains and the _GENE_ protein has a predicted chloroplast transit peptide . when _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli paba pabb or fole mutants which are unable to produce or take up folates the protein and a modified _GENE_ protein enabled growth on formyltetrahydrofolate or folic acid but not on formyltetrahydrofolate triglutamate demonstrating that both proteins mediate folate monoglutamate transport . both proteins also mediate transport of the antifolate analogs methotrexate and aminopterin as evidenced by their ability to greatly increase the sensitivity of e. coli to these inhibitors . the full length _GENE_ polypeptide was translocated into isolated pea chloroplasts and when fused to green _METHOD_ protein directed the passenger protein to the envelope of arabidopsis chloroplasts in transient _PROTEIN_ experiments . _GENE_ transcripts were present at similar levels in roots and aerial organs indicating that the protein occurs in non green _LOCATION_ as well as chloroplasts . insertional inactivation of _GENE_ significantly raised the total folate content of chloroplasts and lowered the proportion of methyltetrahydrofolate but did not discernibly affect growth . these findings establish conservation of function among folate and biopterin transporter family proteins from three _METHOD_ of life .
_PROTEIN_ family genes in cyanobacteria and searches of confirmed and extended the delineation of the _PROTEIN_ family given in the pfam data base . homologs of the leishmania _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transporters were found only in trypanosomatids apicomplexans cyanobacteria and plants . cyanobacterial genomes have a single _PROTEIN_ gene specifying a highly conserved protein . in contrast plant genomes encode several diverse _PROTEIN_ proteins there being nine in arabidopsis . multiple alignment and phylogenetic analysis showed that one of these _GENE_ clustered with cyanobacteria whereas the others fell into two groups of four each . the _GENE_ protein shares identity with the cyanobacterial proteins but differs in having an residue n terminal extension with the features of a _LOCATION_ targeting peptide . the cyanobacterial and plant proteins have predicted transmembrane helices as illustrated in supplemental fig . for the synechocystis protein . because trypanosomatids and apicomplexans have apparently acquired numerous genes from photosynthetic _METHOD_ and plants acquired many genes from cyanobacteria the cyanobacterial protein is potentially the archetype of the _PROTEIN_ family . we accordingly chose a representative cyanobacterial _PROTEIN_ protein synechocystis for further study along with its close plant relative arabidopsis _GENE_ . folate uptake by e. coli _PROTEIN_ or _GENE_ can not normally cross the inner _LOCATION_ of e. coli cells preventing rescue of folate synthesis mutants by supplied folates . we therefore evaluated folate transport activity by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ constructs in a paba pabb mutant which is auxotrophic for paba and testing for growth on minimal medium with or without _PROTEIN_ thf or folic acid in place of paba . the mutant also harbored a plasmid bearing genes for three rare e. coli trnas _PROTEIN_ this plasmid was found to be needed to _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ constructs . the n terminal extension that contains the predicted targeting peptide was removed from _GENE_ constructs basing the truncation point on alignments with and with orthologous plant sequences derived from ests . because the truncated _GENE_ protein had a more hydrophilic n terminal region than and this region may affect _LOCATION_ targeting or translation in e. coli we also constructed a chimeric version in which residues of the truncated protein were replaced by residues of . after two passages on minimal medium plus or minus folate the growth of mutant cells harboring the empty vector ceased . in contrast cells _PROTEIN_ continued to grow when given folates showing that the latter are transported . the truncated _GENE_ did not confer the ability to grow on folates but the chimeric version was effective . cells _PROTEIN_ or chimeric _GENE_ did not grow when _PROTEIN_ thf triglutamate replaced the monoglutamyl form indicating that both transporters like most other folate carriers prefer monoglutamates _LOCATION_ . cells cured of their plasmids were not rescued by folates confirming that the transport trait is plasmid encoded . although _PROTEIN_ thf and folic acid are relatively stable some spontaneous breakdown is inevitable releasing paba glu . to rule out the possibility that the growth seen on folates was due to such release we confirmed that paba glu did not support growth of mutant cells _PROTEIN_ or chimeric _GENE_ . because e. coli can not normally take up paba glu but can utilize it once absorbed this result further shows that neither protein is able to transport paba glu . the results from the paba pabb mutant were corroborated using a second mutant a fole deletant which lacks the first enzyme of the pteridine branch of folate synthesis _PROTEIN_ . this deletant could grow on rich medium supplemented with _PROTEIN_ thf when _PROTEIN_ or chimeric _GENE_ but not when harboring the empty vector . the fole deletant could not be used to test or _GENE_ for transport of dihydropteroate or dihydropterins as these compounds supported growth of deletant cells harboring the empty vector . antifolate antifolates aminopterin and methotrexate are close structural analogs of folic acid differing only in one and two groups respectively . e. coli normally has little capacity to take up these compounds and they are inhibitory only at high concentrations . therefore we tested antifolate transport activity by evaluating growth of cells exposed to antifolate gradients on plates or to various levels of antifolates in liquid medium . _PROTEIN_ of or the chimeric _GENE_ construct imparted large increases in sensitivity that were qualitatively obvious on plates and were quantified as fold in liquid culture . the truncated _GENE_ protein was again ineffective . subcellular localization of _GENE_ was investigated first by transient _PROTEIN_ of an _GENE_ _METHOD_ fusion construct in arabidopsis protoplasts . consistent with the presence of a putative _LOCATION_ targeting peptide _PROTEIN_ of the fusion protein resulted in green _METHOD_ that colocalized with the red _METHOD_ of chlorophyll the green _METHOD_ was strongest at the chloroplast margins suggesting that the protein is concentrated in the envelope . _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ alone gave green _METHOD_ throughout the cytoplasm . import assays with isolated pea chloroplasts substantiated these results . after the import reaction with the full length protein chloroplasts contained a labeled product that was smaller than the full length protein and was protected from attack by thermolysin as expected for a translocated protein . in contrast a truncated version lacking the predicted targeting peptide was not processed and was thermolysin sensitive indicating that it had not been taken up . the latter protein _METHOD_ behaved in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as a kda species as expected but the full length protein _METHOD_ migrated as a kda species . other _PROTEIN_ family proteins likewise migrate anomalously . thus although the migration of the imported protein as a kda band implies that the point we chose to truncate _GENE_ is not identical to the normal processing site electrophoretic anomalies preclude quantifying the discrepancy . _PROTEIN_ of _GENE_ in arabidopsis rt pcr analysis indicated that the _GENE_ gene is constitutively _PROTEIN_ throughout the plant at a low level . thus the abundance of _GENE_ transcripts varied rather little among major organs from to ng of total rna which corresponds to a frequency between in and in mrnas . ubiquitous low level _PROTEIN_ is also reported for _GENE_ in the genevestigator arabidopsis microarray data base . the presence of _GENE_ transcripts in roots as well as aerial organs implies that the protein is _PROTEIN_ in non green _LOCATION_ as well as chloroplasts . identification and analysis of a t dna insertion explore the function of _GENE_ in vivo an arabidopsis line bearing a t dna insertion in the coding region of the gene was identified in the salk collection . this mutant has a single t dna insertion in exon at codon as determined from the flanking dna sequence and co segregation of kanamycin resistance with the t dna . the insertion creates at least two in frame stop codons and therefore is predicted to result in a complete knock out . homozygous mutant plants did not differ noticeably from their wild type siblings in growth rate morphology leaf color or fertility . because _GENE_ is located in the _LOCATION_ we compared the folate profiles of chloroplasts from wild type and mutant plants . as in pea total folate levels in wild type chloroplasts were low about pmol/mg of protein or pmol/mg of chlorophyll which is equivalent to a stromal concentration of . the most prominent folate _METHOD_ were methyl and methenyl thf . relative to wild type mutant chloroplasts contained significantly more methenyl thf and total folate per unit protein and when data were _PROTEIN_ on a percent basis a significantly lower proportion of methyl thf .
