enzymes encoded by bacterial _PROTEIN_ genes catalyze the _PROTEIN_ dependent formation of uridine diphosphate n acetylmuramic acid tripeptide in bacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesis . the arabidopsis thaliana genome contains one gene with homology to the bacterial _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . under normal conditions _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in leaves and flowers but not in roots or _METHOD_ . sequence based predictions and analyses of _METHOD_ fusions of the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ as well as the full length protein suggest that _PROTEIN_ localizes to _LOCATION_ . we identified three t dna tagged and one ds tagged mutant alleles of _PROTEIN_ in a. thaliana . all four alleles show a white phenotype and a. thaliana antisense _PROTEIN_ lines showed a pale green phenotype . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is involved in chloroplast biogenesis . cells of the mutants were inhibited in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ development . rt pcr analysis of the mutant lines suggested that the _PROTEIN_ of genes that depend on a multisubunit _LOCATION_ encoded rna polymerase was _PROTEIN_ . to analyze the functional relationships between the _PROTEIN_ genes of cyanobacteria the moss physcomitrella patens and higher plants a complementation assay was carried out with a p. patens _PROTEIN_ knock out line which exhibits a small number of macrochloroplasts per cell . although the anabaena _PROTEIN_ fused with the n terminal region of ppmure complemented the macrochloroplast phenotype in p. patens transformation with _PROTEIN_ did not complement this phenotype . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is functionally divergent from the bacterial and moss _PROTEIN_ proteins .
a gene with similarity to the bacterial _PROTEIN_ gene was identified in the a. thaliana genome . rt pcr analysis showed that the predicted _PROTEIN_ protein is composed of amino acids with a molecular _METHOD_ of kda . the coding sequence of the cdna matches perfectly that of the _PROTEIN_ cdna . the protein is predicted to contain the catalytic and middle domains and shows high similarity to the bacterial _PROTEIN_ proteins . it is reported that amino acid residues are strictly conserved in the bacterial _PROTEIN_ sequences . an alignment analysis with _PROTEIN_ and ppmure shows that five amino acid substitutions in the conserved amino acids were found only in _PROTEIN_ . although there is no substitution at the _PROTEIN_ binding site and at the structural amino acids mutations occur at substrate and product binding sites and at interaction sites between udp murnac dipeptide and _PROTEIN_ . this result suggested a change of the _PROTEIN_ function for the _PROTEIN_ protein as discussed below . the phylogenetic tree with the amino acid sequences of _PROTEIN_ from bacteria and plants revealed that plant _PROTEIN_ had a separate phylogenetic position from bacterial ones . rna gel blot analysis revealed the accumulation of the _PROTEIN_ mrna in leaves and flowers but not in roots or _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ data deposited in public microarray repositories indicate a similar _PROTEIN_ pattern . the highest _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ mrna was detected in juvenile leaves . the strong probability of the _LOCATION_ localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein was predicted by targetp predotar and pclr . to analyze the localization of _PROTEIN_ in cells we constructed plasmids directing the _PROTEIN_ of either the full length _PROTEIN_ or only its putative transit peptide fused to _METHOD_ . particle bombardment with either of these plasmids resulted in _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in chloroplasts corroborating the prediction . these results suggest a stromal localization for the _PROTEIN_ protein in chloroplasts because the _PROTEIN_ protein is not predicted to have transmembrane domains . to analyze the function of the _PROTEIN_ gene in a. thaliana four lines tagged in the _PROTEIN_ gene were used . one of the tagged lines _PROTEIN_ was identified as an apg mutant in a _PROTEIN_ ds tagged library that was generated using the activator /dissociation system . also used were one t dna tagged _PROTEIN_ and two ds/lox t dna tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant alleles of _PROTEIN_ all of which contain disruption elements inserted in different positions in the first exon of the _PROTEIN_ gene . all four alleles showed a white seedling phenotype and no differences in the phenotypes in different genetic backgrounds were observed in either seedlings or plants of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants and the _PROTEIN_ mutant . these mutant lines also produced seeds that were white at stages when they would normally be green . the white seeds were harvested plated on plates containing sucrose and placed under conditions of normal light and all produced white seedlings . rt pcr performed using _PROTEIN_ specific primers detected no _PROTEIN_ transcripts in the leaves of any of the _PROTEIN_ mutants . to confirm a relationship between _PROTEIN_ and chloroplast development we generated transgenic arabidopsis plants in which an antisense _PROTEIN_ gene was overexpressed under the control of a constitutive camv promoter _PROTEIN_ . seeds of the transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the antisense _PROTEIN_ gene were plated on germination medium plates containing sucrose and their phenotypes were observed . three of the seven transformants showed a pale green phenotype . the levels of _PROTEIN_ transcripts in these lines were determined by rt pcr amplification of the transgene . transgenic and wild type arabidopsis plants were grown for weeks in lighted growth chambers before being used in the experiments . the rt pcr results show that a _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mrna level correlates with the pale green phenotype . these results strongly suggest that _PROTEIN_ acts in chloroplast development . the chlorophyll contents in the _PROTEIN_ mutant were determined . the quantities of chlorophyll a and b in this line were and mg fresh weight respectively much lower than those in wild type plants . next to investigate the photosystem ii activity we analyzed the fv/fm /fm value _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ which is usually used as an indicator of photoinhibition by measuring the chlorophyll _METHOD_ by pulse amplitude modulated fluorometry . the fv/fm of the wild type plants was determined to be but the fv/fm value could not be calculated in homozygous _PROTEIN_ plants because they produced no measurable chlorophyll _METHOD_ . these results suggest that the photosynthetic activities of the mutant are severely damaged . therefore when _PROTEIN_ seeds were sown in plates lacking sucrose they germinated but did not survive . even when _PROTEIN_ seedlings were grown on medium containing sucrose no seeds could be harvested even though the plants produced flowers . we investigated the _LOCATION_ morphology in protoplasts of the white leaves of _PROTEIN_ . staining with the _METHOD_ dna binding dye sybr green i showed that the _LOCATION_ dna was packed into large dots in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . in a. thaliana large _LOCATION_ nucleoids with large quantities of _LOCATION_ dna occupy the stroma in small _LOCATION_ of the leaf primordia before the development of _LOCATION_ and the appearance of small nucleoids with small quantities of dna occurs during the development of the _LOCATION_ system and _LOCATION_ enlargement . large _LOCATION_ nucleoids in cells were also observed in white sectors of the leaf variegation mutant yellow _PROTEIN_ suggesting undifferentiation of _LOCATION_ in the white sectors . the nucleoids in the _PROTEIN_ mutant were large bodies that resembled those typically observed in undifferentiated _LOCATION_ and in _LOCATION_ of the white sectors of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . as the leaves contained little chlorophyll no chlorophyll _METHOD_ was detected at the same exposure time used for the photos of wild type protoplasts . therefore an increased exposure time for red _METHOD_ was used for the mutant . we also investigated _LOCATION_ morphology using transmission electron microscopy . in leaf primordia of the mutant there are few _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . while mature chloroplasts of the wild type plants featured _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in the mutant leaves had irregular shapes and no mature _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the mutant cells did not contain giant _LOCATION_ like those that are detected in the a. thaliana ftsz mutants . along with the abnormalities observed in the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ influences chloroplast development in a. thaliana . the development of chloroplasts from proplastids is closely related to the _PROTEIN_ of chloroplast encoded genes . the _LOCATION_ transcription regulation system of a. thaliana depends on the _LOCATION_ encoded _LOCATION_ rna polymerase _PROTEIN_ and the _LOCATION_ encoded _LOCATION_ rna polymerase . _PROTEIN_ preferentially transcribes photosynthesis related genes in mature chloroplasts whereas nep preferentially transcribes housekeeping genes during early phases of plant development . _LOCATION_ genes can be grouped into three classes based on promoter structures . transcription activities of many photosynthesis related genes depend largely on _PROTEIN_ whereas genes from the _PROTEIN_ operon and _PROTEIN_ are transcribed exclusively by nep . non photosynthetic housekeeping genes are generally transcribed by both _PROTEIN_ and nep . it was recently reported that _PROTEIN_ was present in an affinity purified _PROTEIN_ complex from tobacco chloroplasts and _PROTEIN_ was also identified by tof _METHOD_ analysis as a component of _LOCATION_ transcriptionally active chromosomes isolated from mustard and a. thaliana . if the _PROTEIN_ was related to the _PROTEIN_ transcription system the number of transcripts transcribed by the _PROTEIN_ complex may _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutants . therefore we analyzed the quantities of transcripts that encode several chloroplast proteins transcribed by nep and/or _PROTEIN_ in both wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes were selected as _PROTEIN_ dependent genes _PROTEIN_ was chosen as a nep dependent gene and the genes _PROTEIN_ clpp and ndhb were used as class ii genes . rt pcr experiments using primer sets specific for each gene showed _PROTEIN_ mrna accumulation for the class i gene and increased accumulation of the class iii gene in the total mrna pool . for the class ii genes the accumulation of the ndhb mrna in the tagged lines was higher than in the wild type plants whereas no difference was detected for the _PROTEIN_ or clpp genes . it is known that the ndhb gene is transcribed at a higher rate in the mutant than in wild type _LOCATION_ . these results suggest that the chloroplast _PROTEIN_ system that utilizes _PROTEIN_ is deficient in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . to compare the functions of the _PROTEIN_ genes of cyanobacteria the moss p. patens and a. thaliana a complementation assay was carried out using the p. patens ppmure knock out line . we previously showed that this line produces huge chloroplasts and that transient _PROTEIN_ of the functional ppmure gene in this line can restore the phenotype to that of the wild type . we constructed plasmids containing the _PROTEIN_ or anabaena _PROTEIN_ genes driven by the camv promoter . as the anamure amino acid sequence is closely related to that of ppmure among cyanobacterial _PROTEIN_ we used anamure for complementation tests . to construct a plasmid containing the anamure genes the coding region corresponding to the _LOCATION_ targeting sequence of ppmure was fused to the anamure gene to direct the _LOCATION_ localization of anamure . polyethylene glycol mediated dna transfer into protoplasts of the ppmure knock out transformant was carried out and stable transformants were observed by microscopy . when transformation was performed with the plasmid containing the anamure gene with the ppmure _LOCATION_ targeting sequence p. patens cells showed normal chloroplast phenotypes . in contrast no restoration of the wild type phenotype occurred when transformation was performed with the plasmid containing the _PROTEIN_ gene . although a. thaliana and p. patens are both land plants it was possible that mislocalization of the _PROTEIN_ protein in p. patens cells caused the lack of complementation of the ppmure knock out line . to assess the localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein in p. patens we constructed a plasmid directing the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ transit peptide fused to _METHOD_ . peg mediated transformation of p. patens with this plasmid resulted in _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in chloroplasts . this result suggests that in p. patens cells the _PROTEIN_ protein exhibits the same localization as the ppmure protein in the chloroplast stroma . these results suggest that the function of the _PROTEIN_ protein changed during the evolution from mosses to higher plants .
the mutant line _PROTEIN_ was isolated by screening approximately ds tagged arabidopsis lines that were generated at the _PROTEIN_ institute . we identified _PROTEIN_ from the salk t dna collection and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from the wisconsin t dna collection . we confirmed the insertions of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with the left border primers of the tags . for _PROTEIN_ we sequenced both insertion sites . for normal conditions the transgenic and mutant plants were grown for weeks in growth chambers provided with approximately photon at under a h h dark cycle and were then transferred to soil and grown under the same conditions . for northern analysis morphological observations and measurements of chlorophyll content and _METHOD_ plants were grown for weeks on plates under approximately photon at and in a h h dark cycle and were then transferred to soil and grown under the same conditions . protonemata of the moss p. patens ssp . patens were grown on bcdat medium solidified with agar in a regulated chamber at under continuous light . for northern hybridization of dnase i treated total rna isolated from a. thaliana plants using an rneasy plant mini kit were used . northern blots were performed with church s phosphate buffer and the _PROTEIN_ probe was synthesized using a pcr dig probe synthesis kit with the primers forward ctgatgacgatccacctgaag and reverse cttagccatcaaactctgaacc . after hybridization the filters were washed four times at for min and signals were detected using a dig dna labelling and detection kit . a dna sequence encoding the n terminal region of _PROTEIN_ which includes a putative chloroplast transit peptide region of amino acids was amplified by rt pcr using the primers ggatcctctctgtctccaatggcgttcacc and ggatccgtacgaattccggcgagcaggtc . the fragment was ligated into the bamhi site of _METHOD_ which encodes a synthetic green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ under the control of the constitutive camv promoter . using the same protocol a fusion construct of the coding regions of the _PROTEIN_ cdna and _METHOD_ was generated using the primers ggatcctctctgtctccaatggcgttcacc and ggatccccgccatgggaactcgcttgtgtc . the resulting constructs and that of the _METHOD_ control were introduced into nicotiana tabacum _PROTEIN_ leaves using a pneumatic particle gun _PROTEIN_ . particle bombardment and observation of _METHOD_ signals were performed as described by citation . total rna was extracted from wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants using a nucleospin rna plant isolation kit and were then treated with dnase i . the primers used to amplify the _PROTEIN_ gene were _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and cttagccatcaaactctgaacc . the primers used to amplify _PROTEIN_ were ctaagctctcaagatcaaagg _PROTEIN_ and acattgcaaagagtttcaaggt _PROTEIN_ . then ng of rna was reverse transcribed into cdna with an oligo primer using a primescript rt pcr kit . the first strand cdna was used as a template for pcr with blend taq polymerase . pcr was carried out beginning with an incubation at for min followed by cycles of for sec for min and for min concluding with an extension at for min . the clone containing the _PROTEIN_ cdna was obtained from the _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis full length cdna collection . although sequencing of this plasmid showed that one intron remained in the coding region we used this clone to construct antisense transformants . to produce transgenic arabidopsis plants in which an antisense _PROTEIN_ gene was overexpressed under the control of the constitutive camv promoter the sfii fragment of was inserted into the sfii site of as described . arabidopsis plants were transformed with agrobacterium using the vacuum infiltration method . transgenic plants containing antisense _PROTEIN_ were obtained after selection on gm agar plates containing sucrose and kanamycin . total rna was extracted from the antisense transgenic lines using a nucleospin rna plant isolation kit . total rna was reverse transcribed using superscript ii rtase and of random hexamers and of the product was used as a template for rt pcr with takara extaq polymerase . the primers used to amplify _PROTEIN_ were tctctgtctccaatggcgttcacc and _PROTEIN_ and those used to amplify _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . pcr was carried out on a perkin elmer instrument _METHOD_ _METHOD_ at for min followed by cycles of for sec for sec and for sec and a final extension for min . mutant plants were grown for weeks on medium containing sucrose transferred onto plates containing sucrose and were grown for month under short day conditions . chlorophyll was extracted from leaves using dimethylformamide . chlorophyll contents were measured with a uv spectrophotometer and calculated according to citation . the chlorophyll _METHOD_ of leaves was measured using an _METHOD_ pulse modulated chlorophyll fluorometer . arabidopsis thaliana protoplasts were isolated as described by citation and were stained for min with a dilution of sybr green i solution . _METHOD_ images of cells were recorded with a ccd camera using an olympus or zeiss axioskop plus microscope . for electron microscopy samples of day old plants were fixed in glutaraldehyde buffered with mm sodium cacodylate for h and then transferred into osmium tetroxide overnight . the samples were dehydrated through an ethanol series and embedded in spurr s resin . thin sections were cut and then stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and the sections were observed with a jem electron microscope . we used the _LOCATION_ genes for a photosystem i reaction center protein _PROTEIN_ protein of the core complex of photosystem ii _PROTEIN_ subunit of _PROTEIN_ synthase _PROTEIN_ catalytic subunit of the clp protease _LOCATION_ homolog of the respiratory chain nadh dehydrogenase and a subunit of the acetyl coa _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . first strand cdna was synthesized as described for the rt pcr analysis of _PROTEIN_ . the sequences of the primers used for the rt pcr of _LOCATION_ genes are as follows ccatgctttagcacctggtgt and ccacccagaaggtaatgggtt for _PROTEIN_ tctgggaagctgcatccgtt and _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and ccgctggatagatacctttg for _PROTEIN_ ttcgaagtcctggagaaggag and catgagcttgggcttctgttg for clpp tctcccactccagtcgttgc and gggtatcctgagcaatcgca for ndhb and _PROTEIN_ and ctcctccggaagaacacact for _PROTEIN_ . pcr was carried out at for min followed by an appropriate number of cycles of for sec for min and for min with a final extension at for min . the numbers of pcr cycles used were for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ and ndhb and for _PROTEIN_ clpp and actin . a complementation assay was performed using a moss knock out line in the ppmure gene which produces giant chloroplasts . a transformant in which the ppmure gene was replaced with the anamure gene fused to the ppmure transit peptide coding region was generated as follows . the published genome sequence of anabaena sp . pcc was consulted . the anamure gene was amplified by pcr from anabaena genomic dna using la taq polymerase and the forward forward primer ggggatatcatgaaattgcgggaattacta and the reverse primer ggcattgtccaccctacacattcc which are specific for anamure . in the forward primer an ecorv site was added just before the start codon of the anamure gene . the amplified band corresponding to the anamure genomic region was fused into the vector . the coding region for the ppmure transit peptide the functioning of which was experimentally confirmed using _METHOD_ fusion protein analysis was amplified by pcr with the primers _PROTEIN_ and tctgtctgtttgatccagtaca . the amplified dna was subjected to blunting and kination with a takara bkl kit and was inserted into the ecorv site just before the start codon in the anamure gene to create a plasmid encoding anamure fused to the ppmure transit peptide . a fragment corresponding to the ppt anamure coding region was extracted from the plasmid by digestion at the spei and smai sites in the vector and was inserted between these sites in the pbsiiks hm vector to generate the plasmid pbsiiks hm ppt anamure nt . this vector contains a camv promoter driven hygromycin resistance gene and a cloning site between another camv promoter and the nopaline synthase terminator . the plasmid pbsiiks hm ppt anamure nt was linearized by digestion with pvuii . to replace the ppmure region with ppt anamure by homologous recombination the ppt anamure gene linked to the hygromycin resistance gene was inserted into the middle of the coding sequence of the cloned ppmure gene . the linearized fragment was then inserted into the clai site of a ppmure genomic region clone to generate a plasmid for moss transformation . transformation of p. patens was carried out as described by citation . to generate a plasmid for replacing the ppmure gene with the _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ and the hygromycin resistance gene were inserted into the cloned ppmure genomic region . _PROTEIN_ was amplified by rt pcr from of a. thaliana total rna using the primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the amplified band was fused into the vector . _PROTEIN_ was extracted from the plasmid by digestion with spei and smai and was inserted into the pbsiiks hm vector to generate the plasmid pbsiiks hm _PROTEIN_ nt . the plasmid pbsiiks hm _PROTEIN_ nt was linearized by digestion with pvuii and inserted into the clai site of the genomic clone of ppmure to generate the plasmid ppmure hm _PROTEIN_ ppmure . unfortunately sequence analysis of the clone showed that one intron remained near the end of the _PROTEIN_ coding region . therefore this region was replaced with the correct one as follows . an accurate dna sequence was amplified from the correct cdna clone by pcr using the primers _PROTEIN_ and tacccaccgctatgggaactcgcttg . the fragment was digested with bstxi and nhei and inserted between the bstxi and nhei sites of ppmure hm _PROTEIN_ ppmure to create ppmure hm _PROTEIN_ ppmure . linearized ppmure hm _PROTEIN_ ppmure was used for moss transformation . to construct the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion gene the region encoding the n terminal amino acids of the _PROTEIN_ gene was amplified from the _PROTEIN_ cdna clone using the primers _PROTEIN_ and aaccatggcggagagataagtgttccgatt . the amplified dna was digested with sali and ncoi to cleave the restriction sites encoded by the primers and was inserted into the sali/ncoi digested _METHOD_ plasmid . p. patens was transformed as described previously .
