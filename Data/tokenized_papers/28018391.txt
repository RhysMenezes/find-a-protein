carotenoids play an essential role in light harvesting and protection from excess light . during chloroplast senescence carotenoids are released from their binding proteins and are eventually metabolized . carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase _PROTEIN_ is involved in carotenoid breakdown in senescing leaf and desiccating seed and is part of the proteome of _LOCATION_ which are _LOCATION_ associated lipid droplets . here we demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is functionally active in pg . leaves of arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ mutants constitutively _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fused to yellow _METHOD_ protein showed strong _METHOD_ in pg and reduced carotenoid levels upon dark induced senescence . lipidome wide analysis indicated that carotene lutein and violaxanthin were the principle substrates of _PROTEIN_ in vivo and were cleaved in senescing chloroplasts . moreover carotenoids were shown to accumulate in pg of _PROTEIN_ mutant plants during senescence indicating translocation of carotenoids to pg prior to degradation .
_PROTEIN_ encodes a protein of amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of kda . a n terminal chloroplast transit peptide of residues was predicted by chlorop algorithm . targeting of _PROTEIN_ to the chloroplast and the processing of the predicted transit peptide was assessed in an in vitro import assay using isolated pea chloroplasts . as demonstrated pre _PROTEIN_ was imported and processed inside the chloroplasts to a mature thermolysin resistant protein of the expected _METHOD_ . plastoglobule localization of _PROTEIN_ . pre _PROTEIN_ was incubated with isolated pea chloroplasts from to min in vitro . upon import mature _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed a lower molecular _METHOD_ due to the removal of the transit peptide and unlike was resistant to thermolysin protease . colocalization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in isolated protoplasts of arabidopsis thaliana . isolation of pg by chloroplast _LOCATION_ fractionation on a discontinuous sucrose gradient _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . pure pg fractions contain recombinant _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and lhcbii are envelope pg and _LOCATION_ markers respectively . positive control which corresponds to a _LOCATION_ fraction containing all four markers . subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ was analyzed by confocal microscopy of protoplasts prepared from a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ mutants complemented with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ which were subsequently transformed with a construct encoding _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . chloroplasts were identified by their red chlorophyll _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ as well as the pg marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ resulted in punctate _METHOD_ inside the chloroplasts . moreover the two colocalized in the _METHOD_ spots most likely pg . to exclude that the _METHOD_ spots for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were non specific protein aggregates pg were isolated from transgenic plants by sucrose gradient floatation . due to their low density pg floated to the top of the gradient and were easily isolated by recovering the two first fractions . to evaluate the purity of the pg fractions the following proteins were used as _LOCATION_ markers light harvesting chlorophyll a/b binding for _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ translocon at the inner envelope _LOCATION_ of chloroplasts _PROTEIN_ for the chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a well accepted marker for pg _PROTEIN_ . pure pg as supported by the presence of _PROTEIN_ and the absence of _PROTEIN_ and lhcbii contained the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein _METHOD_ . because of the localization of _PROTEIN_ at pg and the known role of pg in senescence we investigated the lipid composition of pg during natural senescence in _PROTEIN_ . as a control the experiment was simultaneously carried out on an unrelated senescing transgenic line . pg were purified by floatation on a discontinuous sucrose gradient using isolated chloroplast _LOCATION_ . the visible difference between the two pg fractions was striking . the pg fraction from the _PROTEIN_ mutant appeared orange while it was normally pale yellow as seen in the pg fraction from the control line . carotenoids accumulated in senescent _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ . pg were isolated from naturally senescent _PROTEIN_ and control plants by a sucrose gradient loaded with a chlorophyll equivalent of mg of _LOCATION_ . lipids from the pg fractions were analyzed by untargeted ultra high pressure liquid chromatography atmospheric pressure chemical ionization quadrupole time of flight _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ of detected lipids are shown . spectrophotometric analysis of pg fractions . three maxima around nm typical of carotenoid absorption spectra were detected in _PROTEIN_ pg . quantification of total carotenoid contents in pg fractions . absorbance at nm was recorded and compared with a calibration curve of carotene standard . carotenoid content is _PROTEIN_ in of carotene per mg of chlorophyll of total _LOCATION_ used in the experiment . mgdg monogalactosyldiacylglycerol t tocopherol vitk vitamin k pc oh hydroxy plastochromanol plastoquinol pc plastochromanol pq plastoquinone ctrl control car carotene chl chlorophyll . to investigate the composition of _PROTEIN_ pg lipid profiling was carried out . major compounds detected by this method are shown by comparably scaled _METHOD_ in figure . the typical pg prenylquinones were observed in both samples namely tocopherol vitamin k plastochromanol and plastoquinone . monogalactosyldiacylglycerol appeared as the dominant galactolipid in both pg extracts . two compounds at m/z and m/z were tentatively identified as fatty acids _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ respectively . to visualize carotenoids such as carotene and lutein a magnification of the corresponding chromatogram is shown in the upper left corner . in order to compare lipid levels in pg the normalization of pg concentration is critical . we thus considered the total amount of prenylquinones as an internal standard for pg concentration _PROTEIN_ . relative intensities of tocopherol quinone tocopherol vitamin k plastochromanol and plastoquinone were added up and used to normalize data . noteworthy these prenylquinone contents were not significantly affected by the loss of _PROTEIN_ in a whole plant extract . variation between _PROTEIN_ and control was obtained by calculating the fold change of lipid normalized intensity . results are summarized in table and showed a fivefold and a threefold increase in concentration of carotene and lutein respectively in _PROTEIN_ . in addition galactolipids mgdg and were about two to three times more abundant in pg of _PROTEIN_ . lipid content of senescent _PROTEIN_ pg compared to control . in addition a spectroscopic analysis was carried out on isolated pg shown in figure to evaluate the overall carotenoid content by an independent method . the absorption spectra of the pg lipid extracts revealed carotenoid typical peaks with maxima at and nm for _PROTEIN_ which were absent in the control . absolute quantification using a commercial carotene standard showed a fivefold higher carotenoid content in _PROTEIN_ pg compared to that in the control . to investigate _PROTEIN_ subcellular localization and in vivo function a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ were transformed with a construct carrying a glufosinate resistance marker and a fusion between _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ tagged with human influenza hemagglutinin under control of the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . resulting _PROTEIN_ complemented plants were _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . ten independent glufosinate resistant plants were selected based on a visible band at the expected _METHOD_ of kda by immunoblotting with anti ha . progeny of nine lines segregated indicating a single insertion of the transgene . among progeny six independent plants were identified by segregation analysis as being homozygous for the insertion of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct . _PROTEIN_ complemented plants showed a wt phenotype _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ mutant background . to compare _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in transgenic plants with that of _PROTEIN_ in wt plants we carried out qpcr reactions . the relative _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were around two and six times higher than wt . complementation of _PROTEIN_ mutants with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ha . relative amounts of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ha in complemented lines were assessed by immunoblot analysis with anti ha antibodies . a representative blot of independent lines is shown none of which showed a visible phenotype . complementation analysis of _PROTEIN_ complemented lines by dark induced senescence . detached leaves were subjected to dark induced senescence for days and complementation was determined based on the phenotype . two _PROTEIN_ plants were not complemented as they showed a yellowish color similar to _PROTEIN_ . total chlorophyll and carotenoids were extracted from the leaves shown in . concentrations of pigments were established with a spectrophotometer . means sd were calculated for _PROTEIN_ complemented plants wt and _PROTEIN_ . statistical significance was determined by a student s t test . _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ analysis . transcripts of _PROTEIN_ were quantified by qpcr in the wt and in the two complemented lines i.e. _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the relative _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was normalized to the reference gene actin . means sd . statistical significance between transgenic lines and the wt was determined by a student s t test . complementation was assessed by phenotypic observation under dark induced senescence in leaves . surprisingly most of the _PROTEIN_ complemented lines developed a less yellowish leaf phenotype than wt suggesting that their carotenoid content was lower . some lines also showed yellowish leaves similar to the corresponding _PROTEIN_ mutant . however in most transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ appeared to complement _PROTEIN_ which is evident from the lack of yellowing of the leaves upon senescence . note that chlorophyll distribution seemed irregularly affected in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ complemented lines . to quantify the visual observations total chlorophyll and carotenoids were rapidly extracted and analyzed by spectrophotometry . as expected the _PROTEIN_ complemented lines contained significantly less carotenoids than the wt . in contrast _PROTEIN_ contained significantly more carotenoids than the wt . chlorophyll contents showed no statistical difference among the genotypes . in conclusion the constitutive _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not cause an apparent phenotype under standard growth conditions . however the complemented plants exhibited elevated carotenoid degradation under dark induced senescence as supported by less yellowish leaves and reduced total carotenoid contents . to assess the effects of constitutive _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ on the degradation of carotenoids we investigated the lipid contents in leaves before and after dark induced senescence of _PROTEIN_ complemented a. thaliana plants . data obtained from untargeted ultra high pressure liquid chromatography atmospheric pressure chemical ionization quadrupole time of flight _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was subjected to partial least squares discriminant analysis _PROTEIN_ in order to investigate significant differences between treatments . our findings underlined an absence of statistical difference between wt and _PROTEIN_ complemented plants under standard growth conditions whereas senescence resulted in genotype clustering with the first component explaining of the variability . under senescence conditions the _PROTEIN_ da model was validated with a permutation test . as expected _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ displayed a similar lipid profile which was different from that of wt . the loading plot was investigated to point out the _PROTEIN_ compounds responsible for the discrimination between wt and _PROTEIN_ complemented lines . among more than lipids measured the few outlying compounds were identified whenever possible and relative quantifications subjected to student s t test . in brief wt accumulated significantly more lutein and carotene than _PROTEIN_ complemented plants . what is more an unidentified compound at m/z _PROTEIN_ was three times higher in wt . _PROTEIN_ lipids such as mgdg dgdg and pe were more abundant in _PROTEIN_ complemented plants . constitutive _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ resulted in a distinct lipid profile during dark induced senescence in leaves when compared with wt . detached leaves were placed in darkness for days prior to lipid extraction . lipids were analyzed by ultra high pressure liquid chromatography atmospheric pressure chemical ionization quadrupole time of flight _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . discrimination was evaluated with a partial least squares discriminant analysis in which outlying samples were removed prior to data processing . compounds responsible for the difference between _PROTEIN_ complemented lines and wt are indicated on the loading plot . significant according to student s t test . pc principal component . the carotenoid targeted uhplc analysis enabled an absolute and accurate quantification of carotenoids . on the whole total carotenoid levels in senescent leaves of _PROTEIN_ complemented plants were times lower than those of the wt and times lower than those of _PROTEIN_ . the contents of carotene lutein and violaxanthin were all significantly reduced in _PROTEIN_ complemented plants while neoxanthin was not . neoxanthin and violaxanthin contents were the least affected in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . in contrast violaxanthin was reduced about threefold in _PROTEIN_ complemented plants compared with wt . reduced level of photosynthesis related carotenoids during senescence in _PROTEIN_ complemented plants . detached leaves were placed in darkness for days prior to lipid extraction . lipids were separated by uhplc dad following the carotenoid profiling protocol . absolute quantification of carotenoids was carried out on the basis of calibration curves obtained with pure standards . box plots created with sigmaplot are shown . statistical differences across genotypes were assessed with a one way _PROTEIN_ . pairwise multiple comparisons revealed significant differences .
