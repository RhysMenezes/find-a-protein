plants can sense neighbour competitors through light quality signals and respond with shade avoidance responses . these include increased shoot elongation which enhances light capture and thus competitive power . such plant plant interactions therefore profoundly affect plant development in crowded populations . shade avoidance responses are tightly coordinated by interactions between light signals and hormones with essential roles for the phytochrome b photoreceptor and the hormone gibberellin . the family of growth suppressing della proteins are targets for ga signalling and are proposed to integrate signals from other hormones . however the importance of these regulators has not been studied in the ecologically relevant complex realm of plant canopies . here we show that della abundance is regulated during growth responses to neighbours in dense arabidopsis stands . this occurs in a r fr dependent manner in petioles depends on ga and matches the induction kinetics of petiole elongation . similar interactions were observed in the growth response of seedling hypocotyls and are general for a second canopy signal reduced blue light . enhanced della stability in the gai mutant inhibits shade avoidance responses indicating that della proteins constrain shade avoidance . however using multiple della knockout mutants we show that the observed della breakdown is not sufficient to induce shade avoidance in petioles but plays a more central role in hypocotyls . these data provide novel information on the regulation of shade avoidance under ecologically important conditions defining the importance of della proteins and ga and unravelling the existence of ga and della independent _METHOD_ .
growth responses to neighbours were studied in dense arabidopsis canopies . after approximately days of canopy development enhanced petiole elongation was visible in crowded plants which was accompanied by upward movement of leaves . this _METHOD_ that arabidopsis shows essential shade avoidance traits when competing for light with con specific neighbours . shade avoidance responses are triggered by a reduced r fr ratio but also by reduced blue light levels and both signals were present in the arabidopsis canopies . confocal imaging of canopy grown prga _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants showed that the abundance of the della protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in parallel with increased petiole elongation which probably indicates enhanced ga action . to more precisely identify the mechanism underpinning these responses at the whole plant level in canopies we investigated the regulation of elongation responses of isolated plants to both low r fr and low blue light signals pronounced petiole elongation responses occurred in the wild type ler during h low r fr treatments . however no growth stimulation was observed upon low blue light treatment for h . the response to low r fr was diminished by ga deficiency in ler plants treated with the ga biosynthesis inhibitor paclobutrazol and in the ga deficient mutant . subsequent ga addition restored the response to low r fr and control growth rates whereas ga addition to normal wild type ler plants did not affect petiole elongation . this suggests saturation by endogenous ga under control light conditions and thus that enhanced ga biosynthesis only would not be sufficient to induce shade avoidance . ga presence and function are thus essential for low r fr induced petiole elongation in arabidopsis . in agreement with this phytochrome mediated shade avoidance is reduced in the gai mutant which has reduced ga sensitivity due to enhanced stability of the della protein gai . although this mutant displays constitutive suppression of petiole elongation under both light conditions its response to low r fr is reduced to approximately half of that in ler . this was also confirmed by a dedicated two way _PROTEIN_ on these two genotypes which identified a significant genotype by environment interaction . the _PROTEIN_ that the r fr response was not totally absent in this gai mutant probably indicates the action of other della proteins such as _PROTEIN_ . thus enhanced della stability inhibits low r fr induced petiole elongation . next we studied whether della breakdown is a major regulatory step in the signalling cascade that directly induces the processes that induce shade avoidance or della proteins are a constraint on shade avoidance that must be degraded but without this breakdown itself further inducing the shade avoidance response . to study the roles of individual della proteins knockouts of four della proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were investigated . hypothesis predicts constitutively high elongation in the knockouts with little or no response to canopy signals whereas in hypothesis della knockouts are not necessarily elongated and can still normally respond to the canopy signals . figure shows that these single and multiple della knockouts do not show constitutively elongated petioles indicating that low della abundance alone does not lead to shade avoidance . furthermore these della knockouts show normal petiole elongation responses to low r fr . della knockouts thus have very mild phenotypes under conditions with normal ga content . as della proteins are highly abundant under ga deficient conditions where they are not targeted by ga for breakdown ga deficient plants show strong suppression of growth and shade avoidance . interestingly we show here that della knockouts can rescue the far red response in ga deficient plants as the full low r fr response occurred in the ga deficient _PROTEIN_ triple mutant . this indicates that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are the major della proteins that inhibit low r fr induced petiole elongation when present at sufficiently high levels . accordingly the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ knockouts could not restore the response in plants and the paclobutrazol treated quadruple _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ knockout mutant behaved similarly to _PROTEIN_ . these della interactions are ga specific as illustrated by the _PROTEIN_ that _PROTEIN_ abundance is much reduced upon low r fr treatment and this reduction in abundance is prevented by ga deficiency and restored by adding back ga . in conclusion della proteins are broken down in a ga dependent manner under low r fr _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and this is important for shade avoidance . however della breakdown alone is certainly not sufficient for enhanced elongation growth of petioles as della knockouts do not have constitutively shade avoiding petioles . this is strongly supported by the dramatic response to low r fr in petioles of the multiple della knockouts under ga deficient conditions . we studied the kinetics of low r fr induced petiole elongation and _PROTEIN_ abundance to determine whether the timing of della breakdown matches the elongation response . petiole elongation rates increased approximately h after the start of low r fr treatment reached a maximum after h and remained approximately constant until at least h . in accordance with this the _PROTEIN_ protein disappeared after h and remained undetectable during this same growth phase . these data confirm that the kinetics of enhanced petiole elongation and _PROTEIN_ breakdown are similar supporting the notion that della proteins are negative regulators of shade avoidance and thus are broken down to allow enhanced petiole elongation to occur . not only fully grown plants but also very young seedlings can be exposed to neighbour detection signals . we therefore tested hypocotyl responses to low r fr to investigate whether della involvement in shade avoidance is general throughout plant development . the elongation response to low r fr was absent in ga deficient seedlings but could be rescued by adding back ga . low r fr induced hypocotyl elongation was absent in the ga insensitive gai mutant which had wild type hypocotyl lengths under control light conditions . enhanced della stability thus did not affect hypocotyl length under control light conditions but did prevent low r fr induced hypocotyl elongation indicating that the reduced length of gai under low r fr does not result from reduced general growth but rather from a reduced response to low r fr . accordingly low r fr led to disappearance of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal which was prevented by paclobutrazol treatment and could be restored by adding back ga . losing both della proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ restored control hypocotyl elongation in ga deficient seedlings to wild type levels under control light conditions as described previously . the hypocotyl response to low r fr however was only partly restored by multiple della knockouts in a ga deficient background . in contrast to petioles hypocotyls of the quadruple della knockout were constitutively elongated accounting for approximately half of the low r fr induced hypocotyl elongation response . della proteins may thus not only constrain low r fr induced hypocotyl elongation but unlike petioles della absence in hypocotyls may even induce part of the shade avoidance response . however this can not account for the full response to low r fr . as reduced blue light photon fluence rates are another neighbour detection signal in canopies we tested whether the r fr data can be reproduced for blue light . the response of hypocotyl elongation to low blue light was much stronger than the response to low r fr but was similarly ga dependent as ga deficiency almost completely abolished the response . as for low r fr low blue light induced elongation could be rescued in ga deficient plants by adding back ga . enhanced della stability in the gai mutant did not affect control growth but did strongly suppress the hypocotyl elongation response to low blue light . this is very similar to the low r fr induced elongation response . della knockouts could rescue low blue light induced shade avoidance in ga deficient seedlings . this _METHOD_ that the involvement of ga in shade avoidance is through its regulation of della proteins . in accordance with this the low blue light induced disappearance of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was prevented by inhibition of ga biosynthesis with paclobutrazol . the elongated hypocotyls of quadruple della knockouts under control light conditions suggests that della reduction in hypocotyls may induce downstream processes leading to shade avoidance . however as for low r fr this can not account for the entire low blue light induced hypocotyl elongation response indicating that other processes must also be operating to induce the strong elongation response to low blue light .
all mutant and transgenic lines used in this study are in the arabidopsis thaliana landsberg _LOCATION_ background . ga involvement in shade avoidance was investigated using the ga deficient and ga insensitive gai mutants . the roles of four of the five arabidopsis della proteins were studied using the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutants and the _PROTEIN_ double and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ quadruple knockout lines in the ler background . these della knockouts were also studied in the ga deficient mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . abundance of the della protein _PROTEIN_ was studied in transgenic plants _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein . seeds were generously donated by dr n.p . harberd john innes centre norwich uk _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ dr j. peng institute of molecular and cell biology singapore _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and dr t.p . sun duke university durham nc usa _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . for petiole elongation studies seeds were sown on filter paper soaked with water or a solution of _PROTEIN_ stratified for days at and then germinated for days in a growth chamber under standard growth conditions of h light h dark . seedlings were then transferred to pots with a potting soil/perlite substrate mixture and additional nutrients . plants were used for light and ga experiments days after sowing . the resulting densities were plants per for individually potted plants and plants per for canopy grown plants . for hypocotyl experiments surface sterilized seeds were sown on agar with low nutrients _METHOD_ stratified and then transferred to a growth chamber . after days seedlings were transferred to the various light quality compartments . canopy studies were performed under standard growth conditions and the central nine plants from each canopy were measured . light quality was measured using a licor spectroradiometer with a remote cosine receptor attached . the receptor was held horizontally at approximately cm above the soil in the canopies to record the quality of light reflected from neighbouring plants . ga biosynthesis was inhibited by adding ml of paclobutrazol solution to the pots days prior to the light treatments or by adding paclobutrazol to the agar plates . paclobutrazol gave typical ga deficiency _METHOD_ such as dwarfing and dark green leaves . this could be rescued by ga treatments which took place by daily spraying with _PROTEIN_ solution or by adding _PROTEIN_ to the plates . light quality manipulations took place in a white light background . the r fr ratio was reduced from to by supplemental far red light _PROTEIN_ . blue light photon fluence rates were reduced from to < using two layers of lee medium yellow filter . photosynthetically active radiation for all light treatments was _PROTEIN_ at . one day before the experiment plants were transferred to the relevant growth cabinet for acclimatization . light treatments started on the subsequent day at am and lasted h. petiole lengths were measured using a digital caliper at t and h to calculate growth as the length increment over h. petiole elongation rates were also determined by linear displacement transducers to determine petiole elongation kinetics under normal and low r fr conditions . for hypocotyl studies seedlings were transferred to the light treatments days after sowing . hypocotyl lengths were measured after days of light treatment using a custom built image analysis system _PROTEIN_ . two way analysis of variance _PROTEIN_ with tukey b post hoc comparisons _PROTEIN_ revealed whether there were significant differences between genotypes and treatments . experiments were independently repeated at least three times . the abundance of the della protein _PROTEIN_ was studied using the prga _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ reporter line . _METHOD_ was detected using an inverted confocal laser scanning microscope . the excitation wavelength was nm a nm bandpath filter was used for _METHOD_ emission and a nm long pass filter was used to visualize red _METHOD_ by chloroplasts . images depict z stacks of petioles and hypocotyls . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ of petioles and hypocotyls was determined at the same time points as the length measurements . the basal middle and uppermost regions of hypocotyls and petioles were studied but only images from the basal region are shown as this is where most of the cell elongation occurs . confocal images are representative selections from at least nine replicates of at least three independent experiments . it was recently shown by western blotting with an anti _METHOD_ antibody that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal visualized through confocal imaging gives a reliable estimation of the abundance of this fusion protein .
