_PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are homologous genes encoding three putative glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored classical arabinogalactan proteins _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . they are distinguished from other _PROTEIN_ by a short c terminal lysine rich region . organ specific _PROTEIN_ of these genes was revealed by northern blot analysis . _PROTEIN_ was strongly _PROTEIN_ in leaves and _METHOD_ and weakly _PROTEIN_ in flowers and roots _PROTEIN_ was strongly _PROTEIN_ in flowers and moderately _PROTEIN_ in roots _METHOD_ and young leaves and _PROTEIN_ was strongly _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ moderately _PROTEIN_ in flowers and roots and weakly _PROTEIN_ in young leaves . one of these genes _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ and purified as a green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion protein in transgenic tobacco cells using hydrophobic interaction chromatography size exclusion chromatography and reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography . the fusion protein produced a characteristic _PROTEIN_ smear with a molecular _METHOD_ of kda when detected by western blot analysis . glycosyl composition and linkage analyses of purified _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ showed that _PROTEIN_ accounted for of the molecule with arabinose and galactose as major and rhamnose and _PROTEIN_ acid as minor glycosyl residues and with galactose _PROTEIN_ acid galactose and terminal arabinose as major linkages . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was also precipitated by yariv reagent further confirming that _PROTEIN_ is a bona fide _PROTEIN_ . confocal _METHOD_ microscopy of plasmolysed transformed cells indicated that _PROTEIN_ is localized on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and in hechtian strands . hydroxyproline glycoside profiles of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in conjunction with the deduced protein sequence also served to corroborate the hyp contiguity hypothesis which predicts contiguous hyp residues as attachment sites for arabinosides and clustered non contiguous hyp residues as attachment sites for arabinogalactan polysaccharides .
_PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are distinguished from other arabidopsis classical _PROTEIN_ by a c terminal lysine rich region . these proteins share amino acid sequence similarity to the biochemically well characterized homolog in tomato leagp as well as to other homologs including tobacco cucumber csagp and pine . clustal analysis and the resulting phylogenetic tree of these various lysine rich _PROTEIN_ along with other known classical _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ peptide sequences from arabidopsis show that the lysine rich _PROTEIN_ constitute a distinct phylogenetic branch . interestingly while _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are closely related to one another and to their apparent orthologs in other plant species _PROTEIN_ is more distantly related with no clear orthologous sequences with the possible exception of . in order to study which organs _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ total rna was extracted from different organs of month old arabidopsis plants including young and old leaves roots elongated inflorescence _METHOD_ and flowers and subjected to northern blot analysis . _PROTEIN_ of these genes varied in different organs . _PROTEIN_ was strongly _PROTEIN_ in leaves and _METHOD_ weakly _PROTEIN_ in flowers and barely _PROTEIN_ in roots . _PROTEIN_ was very highly _PROTEIN_ in flowers strongly _PROTEIN_ in roots and _METHOD_ and weakly _PROTEIN_ in leaves . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was strong in _METHOD_ moderate in roots and flowers and very weak in leaves . in addition _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis suspension cultured cells was examined and found to increase after week of subculturing but then _PROTEIN_ thereafter . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ genetic construction was delivered into tobacco culture cells through agrobacterium mediated transformation . transformed cells were screened on solid _METHOD_ or schenk and hildebrandt medium with kanamycin and timentin . after _METHOD_ microscopic examination cell lines with the brightest green _METHOD_ were selected for propagation in liquid culture . subsequently cell lines secreting the highest amount of fusion protein into the culture medium were selected and used for further cytochemical and biochemical analysis . the subcellular localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in transgenic cells was determined by laser scanning confocal microscopy . green _METHOD_ predominantly appeared on the cell surfaces of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transformed cells while untransformed cells showed essentially no background _METHOD_ as previously observed . moreover following plasmolysis of these transgenic cells with nacl green _METHOD_ was localized to the retracted _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and hechtian strands which serve as attachment sites between the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and cell wall . in addition to being targeted to the cell surface _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was also secreted into culture media . the same biochemical strategy used by zhao et al . was employed here to purify the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein from the conditioned culture medium . by a three step chromatographic procedure sequentially involving hydrophobic interaction chromatography gel filtration chromatography and reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography the fusion glycoprotein was purified to homogeneity as indicated by a single symmetric peak after hplc fractionation and used for biochemical characterization . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was subjected to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and detected by western blot analysis with an anti _METHOD_ polyclonal antibody . the apparent molecular weight ranged from to da . heating the fusion protein prior to gel loading caused some _METHOD_ to dissociate from the fusion product consistent with previous reports . more thorough removal of _METHOD_ from the fusion protein however was achieved by chymotryptic digestion of a chymotryptic cleavage site engineered within the bsrgi restriction site used in creating the transgene . the _PROTEIN_ moiety of the _PROTEIN_ glycoprotein covers the protein backbone and protects it from protease cleavage as was the case for leagp examined previously . amino acid composition analysis of _PROTEIN_ lacking _METHOD_ demonstrated that the molar percentages of amino acid residues matched those predicted from the _PROTEIN_ gene sequence with of the proline residues being hydroxylated to hyp . glycosyl composition analysis of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein showed that the protein backbone accounted for of the total _METHOD_ of the glycoprotein while _PROTEIN_ accounted for . excluding _METHOD_ the protein backbone of _PROTEIN_ accounted for of the dry weight of the glycoprotein while _PROTEIN_ accounted for . glycosyl composition analysis of the fusion protein showed that the major glycosyl residues were arabinose and galactose and the minor components included rhamnose and _PROTEIN_ acid . in addition the fusion protein was precipitated by yariv reagent . hyp glycoside profile analysis of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein showed that of the total hyp had polysaccharide substituents while the rest of the hyp was either not glycosylated or attached to oligoarabinoses . glycosyl linkage analyses of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ leagp fusion proteins were determined at the _PROTEIN_ complex research center and at the university of melbourne respectively . glycosyl linkages of _METHOD_ leagp and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were consistent with that found in type ii arabinogalactans . in particular the branched galactopyranose linkage was the most abundant linkage although both galp and galp were also present . other notable linkages present include an abundance of terminal arabinose residues particularly in leagp with lesser amounts of terminal rhamnose and terminal galactose in both glycoproteins . both of these glycoproteins also have considerable amounts of linked and terminal _PROTEIN_ acid . linkage analysis of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was generally but not completely consistent with the glycosyl composition data . despite repeating the analysis linkage analysis underestimated the amount of arabinose present possibly because of the loss of volatile partially methylated alditol acetate derivatives of arabinose .
arabidopsis plants were grown at under a h cycle . tobacco cells were cultured in sh medium and arabidopsis cells were cultured in gamborg s medium on a rotary shaker at . a bsrgi restriction site was introduced to the end of _PROTEIN_ immediately after the signal sequence and a noti restriction site was introduced to the end of _PROTEIN_ via polymerase chain reaction amplification . the sense primer containing the bsrgi site was _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tac _PROTEIN_ ggc caa tct ccg gcc acc gca ccg _PROTEIN_ and the antisense primer containing the noti site was cgc ggt gcg gcc _PROTEIN_ tta gaa ggc tag aac aag tag _PROTEIN_ . the amplified _PROTEIN_ fragment was cloned into plasmid puc sstom _METHOD_ leagp as a bsrgi noti fragment in place of the leagp cdna sequence . the new construct was designated as puc sstom _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and was sequenced at the ohio university dna sequencing facility . after sequencing the construct was subcloned into the plant vector as a bamhi saci fragment in place of the _PROTEIN_ reporter gene with the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter left behind to drive _PROTEIN_ . the based plasmid harboring the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct was delivered into agrobacterium tumefaciens strain by the freeze thaw method . agrobacterium mediated cell transformation and selection and _PROTEIN_ of transformed tobacco cell lines were conducted as described by zhao et al . . transgenic cells were subcultured every weeks in sh medium . _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein in transgenic tobacco cells was observed using a zeiss confocal laser scanning _METHOD_ microscope _PROTEIN_ with a _METHOD_ filter set . purification of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was performed according to the procedure described by shpak et al . with minor modifications . briefly conditioned medium was collected from to day old transgenic tobacco cell suspension cultures concentrated by rotary evaporation and dialyzed with distilled water . nacl was added to concentrated cell medium to achieve a final concentration of m and then the medium was loaded on a phenyl sepharose fast flow column previously equilibrated in m nacl . the column was sequentially eluted with m nacl and distilled water . the _METHOD_ fraction as visualized by uv light was collected and freeze dried . the sample was dissolved in water and loaded onto a superose gel filtration column equilibrated in mm sodium phosphate buffer ph . the column was eluted with mm sodium phosphate buffer . the high molecular weight _METHOD_ fusion protein was separated from dissociated _METHOD_ and a small amount of other proteins with lower molecular weights . the fraction with the _METHOD_ fusion protein was purified further by hplc with a semi preparative polymeric reverse phase column as previously described . neutral sugars were analyzed as alditol acetate derivatives by gas chromatography using a hewlett packard hp column programmed from to at . data were captured by hewlett parkard _METHOD_ software . purified _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was used for each analysis with nmol of myo inositol as internal standard . uronic acids of this glycoprotein were assayed by the colorimetric method based on the reaction with m hydroxydiphenyl using d _PROTEIN_ acid as a standard . linkage analysis was performed at the complex _PROTEIN_ research center at the university of georgia and at the plant cell biology research centre at the university of melbourne as previously described _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ was removed from the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein by chymotryptic digestion as described by zhao et al . with minor modifications . briefly an aqueous solution with mg of fusion protein was heat denatured in boiling water for min cooled and then incubated with a freshly prepared chymotrypsin solution with ammonium bicarbonate and mm for h at room temperature . the sample was concentrated and subsequently fractionated with a superose gel filtration column and a prp column . amino acid composition analysis of _PROTEIN_ without _METHOD_ was carried out by rp hplc on a beckman gold system after hcl hydrolysis and subsequent _PROTEIN_ derivatization as described earlier . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was dissolved in distilled water and precipitated by addition of an equal volume of yariv reagent as described previously . purified _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was hydrolyzed in m sodium hydroxide neutralized and fractionated on a _PROTEIN_ cation exchange column in order to elucidate the hyp glycoside profile as described previously . seedlings cultured cells and different organs of month old arabidopsis plants were ground with a mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen . cauline and top rosette leaves were harvested as young leaves while rosette leaves at the base of the plants were harvested as old leaves . total rna was extracted with the rneasy plant total rna kit _PROTEIN_ . rna was electrophoresed in agarose formaldehyde gels and transferred by capillary action onto zeta probe genomic tested blotting _LOCATION_ following the manufacturer s recommendations . dna probes were labeled with dctp using the prime a gene labeling system . equivalent loading of rna samples was confirmed by ethidium bromide staining of rrna . rna gel blots were hybridized with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ gene probes corresponding to the complete coding regions without the signal peptides at in hybridization buffer _PROTEIN_ overnight and washed at in diluted hybridization buffer twice and diluted hybridization buffer once . washed _LOCATION_ were exposed with kodak storage phosphor screens . the hybridization intensity of specific mrnas was scanned and quantified using a personal molecular imager fx . sizes of the hybridizing rnas were determined by comparison with a set of rna size markers run in the gel . although _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ gene sequences share sequence similarities northern blots show no cross hybidization between probes . all three probes hybridize to unique and separable mrnas species corresponding to different mrna sizes predicted for these three genes . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in gels and subjected to western blot analysis using an anti _METHOD_ polyclonal antibody to detect the fusion protein as described by sun et al . . the protein sequences were downloaded from pubmed . alignment and phylogenetic analyses were performed using the clustal x program and the phylogenetic tree was drawn using treeview .
