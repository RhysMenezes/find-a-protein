intracellular trafficking of auxin transporters has been implicated in diverse developmental processes in plants . although the dynamic trafficking pathways of _PROTEIN_ formed auxin efflux proteins have been studied intensively the trafficking of _PROTEIN_ binding cassette protein subfamily b proteins still remains largely uncharacterized . in this study we address the intracellular trafficking of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis root epidermal cells . pharmacological analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ barely recycled between the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and endosomes although it slowly endocytosed via the lytic _LOCATION_ pathway . _METHOD_ recovery after photobleaching analysis revealed that _PROTEIN_ is strongly retained in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ further supporting _PROTEIN_ s nonrecycling property . the endocytosis of _PROTEIN_ was not dependent on the _PROTEIN_ function and the sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ to brefeldin a required guanine nucleotide exchange _PROTEIN_ for adenosyl ribosylation _PROTEIN_ other than _PROTEIN_ . these characteristics of intracellular trafficking of _PROTEIN_ are well contrasted with those of _PROTEIN_ formed proteins suggesting that _PROTEIN_ may be a basic and constitutive auxin efflux transporter for cellular auxin homeostasis .
to characterize the intracellular trafficking of _PROTEIN_ its subcellular localization in root epidermal cells was observed . colocalization analysis of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transformants with the endocytic tracer revealed that only a small number of _PROTEIN_ containing vesicles overlapped with positive endosomes . because the abundance of _PROTEIN_ in endosomes is low we tested _PROTEIN_ endosomal localization in the _PROTEIN_ overexpression line and compared this with _PROTEIN_ localization . similar low abundance of _PROTEIN_ in endosomal vesicles was also observed in the root tissues of pro _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transformants and with leaf protoplast cells . however in root epidermal cells _PROTEIN_ exhibited higher levels of endosomal localization compared with _PROTEIN_ . in order to identify the endosomes in which _PROTEIN_ localizes we performed colocalization studies with certain known endosomal markers . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ partially overlapped with the scattered cytoplasmic particles of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ is known as a prevacuolar compartment marker that acts in the degradation pathway of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and is also responsible for redirecting the proteins to the trans _LOCATION_ network and the pm . however _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to localize not only to the pvc but also predominantly in the tgn as the recycling point for _LOCATION_ sorting receptors from the pvc to the tgn . next we examined whether _PROTEIN_ colocalizes with orthologs _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ homolog _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ homolog _PROTEIN_ other pvc markers . the double transgenic seedlings of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and pro _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ failed to show any distinct _PROTEIN_ localization in the _PROTEIN_ positive endosomes . like _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was also not observed in the _PROTEIN_ positive endosomes . additionally internal _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not overlap with the _LOCATION_ marker sialyl transferase _PROTEIN_ dsred . to test whether _PROTEIN_ localized in the endosomes that are involved in _PROTEIN_ recycling the trafficking inhibitor was employed . blocks early endocytosis of _PROTEIN_ as well as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ resulting in the internal accumulation of characteristic endosidin bodies defined by two tgn/early endosome markers syntaxin _PROTEIN_ and the v _PROTEIN_ subunit vha . although caused internal _PROTEIN_ aggregations it failed to form similar endosidin bodies with _PROTEIN_ which indicates that _PROTEIN_ trafficking is predominantly independent . bfa blocks the retargeting of endocytosed vesicles from recycling to the pm as well as the degradation pathway to the _LOCATION_ and results in aggregates inside the cell . because _PROTEIN_ generated bfa compartments like _PROTEIN_ bfa treatment analysis together with the use of subcellular compartment markers could provide information about the trafficking pathways of _PROTEIN_ . thus we tried to identify the subcellular organelles that are present in the _PROTEIN_ containing bfa compartments . although _PROTEIN_ did not show strong endosomal localization bfa induced its aggregation into bfa compartments that merged closely with positive endosomes . bfa treatment caused both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to form ball shaped bfa compartments and these two signals appeared to be merged which is consistent with the results shown in figure . however _PROTEIN_ was partially merged with the bfa compartments of _PROTEIN_ in response to bfa and some of them were located at the edge of the _PROTEIN_ aggregates . another pvc marker _PROTEIN_ did not merge with bfa compartments of _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ endosomes did not aggregate together upon bfa treatment like _PROTEIN_ but surrounded the abcb aggregates . also _PROTEIN_ containng bfa compartments did not colocalize with that of _PROTEIN_ dsred . upon bfa treatment of this line _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ dsred signals formed large bfa compartments in a similar way a round ball like shape for abcb _METHOD_ and a _PROTEIN_ like organization for _PROTEIN_ dsred . however the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals resided within the circular _LOCATION_ structure and the two signals barely overlapped . in summary part of _PROTEIN_ endocytoses through _PROTEIN_ positive endosomes and the number of _PROTEIN_ containing endosomes is less abundant compared with that of _PROTEIN_ . whereas _PROTEIN_ recycling between the pm and endosomes was demonstrated using a green to red photoconvertible version of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the recycling status of _PROTEIN_ has not been demonstrated . from the results in figure we considered that the recycling pathways of _PROTEIN_ from the pm and endosomes are not active instead an endocytic pathway to the _LOCATION_ could be the relevant trafficking pathway for _PROTEIN_ which is also responsive to bfa . in order to address this hypothesis we examined from which pathway _PROTEIN_ positive bfa compartments are produced . for this purpose we also used a uv induced green to red photoconvertible protein for tracing the trafficking of pm proteins . the _PROTEIN_ mutant root grows slightly longer hairs most likely due to the partial lack of _PROTEIN_ mediated auxin efflux in the root hair cell . the n terminal kaede fusion of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ partially rescued the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype as the c terminal _METHOD_ version did indicating that the fusion construct is functional . uv radiation under a object lens effectively converted the _METHOD_ of kaede _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins from green to red in root epidermal cells . only a small part of the green kaede _PROTEIN_ containing pm was activated and then the formation of _PROTEIN_ containing bfa compartments was observed . although derived from limited endocytic resources bfa compartments containing the weak red kaede signals were formed near the activated pm regions . bfa compartments that were formed distal to the photoactivated pm section exhibited weaker red kaede signals than proximal compartments whereas the opposite pattern was observed for green kaede _PROTEIN_ . the same tendency was observed in nine out of independent seedlings but the other three contained only one bfa compartment in the cells adjacent to photoactivated pm thus we excluded them from the comparison . these findings suggest that endocytosis is responsible for the pm derived vesicles that reside in the _PROTEIN_ containing bfa compartments . to address whether _PROTEIN_ containing bfa compartments are derived by blocking _PROTEIN_ recycling to the pm after endocytosis and/or trafficking to the _LOCATION_ we tracked the _PROTEIN_ signal from bfa compartments after washing out the bfa . kaede _PROTEIN_ containing cells were treated with bfa for h before photoconversion . one large bfa compartment of green kaede _PROTEIN_ was marked as a region of interest and converted to red kaede _PROTEIN_ upon nm radiation . after a h washout the bfa compartment disappeared and the red kaede _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ signals including neighbor _LOCATION_ were compared before and after washing out the bfa . the sum of red kaede signal intensity for the gray and yellow arrowheads marking the pm are and before the washout and and after washout of bfa respectively . the red kaede signal level was not significantly changed after the washout of bfa and was seen repeatedly in nine independent cells from nine trials . our data suggest that _PROTEIN_ recycling between the pm and endosomes is unlikely and the bfa compartments of _PROTEIN_ seem to be generated mostly by blocking endocytosis to the _LOCATION_ . however the signal of green kaede _PROTEIN_ in the bfa compartment was much weaker than the _PROTEIN_ signal at the pm because only approximately of the abcb signal at the pm is bfa sensitive . this affected the intensity of the photoconverted red kaede _PROTEIN_ bfa compartment and sequentially the red kaede _PROTEIN_ signal at the pm after washout . thus the possibility that some undetectable amounts of red kaede _PROTEIN_ recycles to the pm can not be completely ruled out . bfa resistance and the low endocytosis rate of _PROTEIN_ as indicated by its stable residence in the pm raise the question of whether _PROTEIN_ associates strongly with the pm . _METHOD_ recovery after photobleaching analysis was performed to assess the strength of association between _PROTEIN_ and the pm . this technique determines protein mobility in living cells by measuring the rate of _METHOD_ recovery at a bleached site . the mobility of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was compared using frap analysis . the _METHOD_ signals of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were bleached from or wide pm regions of the root epidermal cells and _METHOD_ recovery was recorded over time . this experiment was designed to test the following three possibilities . first if the pm _METHOD_ recovers only by _PROTEIN_ diffusion of unbleached proteins then the recovery time will be proportional to the width of the bleached area . this parameter can indicate whether the protein has strong residence in the pm or low recycling between the pm and endosomes . second if recycling processes are the only contributors to recovery then the _METHOD_ recovery rate will be similar _PROTEIN_ of the size of the bleached area . third if both _PROTEIN_ diffusion and recycling contribute to recovery then the recovery rate will vary according to their relative contribution levels . _METHOD_ was observed for approximately min after bleaching . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed to recover faster with a bleach compared with a bleach . to estimate the process of recovery the maximum recovery value from the recovery curves of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ after photobleaching was extrapolated using spss software and then the ratio of the time required to attain recovery of the extrapolated maximum recovery was calculated . theoretically a ratio of should indicate that _METHOD_ has recovered by _PROTEIN_ diffusion within the pm whereas a ratio of would indicate recovery by the recycling process . values between and can be considered to arise from a mix of the two processes where both diffusion and recycling contribute to recovery . however because cycloheximide was not employed for these experiments the contribution of recycling and de novo secretion of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ recovery could not be distinguished . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ showed faster recovery with the bleach than with the bleach . however the difference between the two recovery curves of _PROTEIN_ was distinctively larger than that of _PROTEIN_ within min and they exhibited different ratios of namely for _PROTEIN_ and for _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ recovery by _PROTEIN_ diffusion is more predominant than recovery by recycling or de novo _PROTEIN_ secretion suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ protein is associated with the pm and that its intracellular trafficking is less compared with _PROTEIN_ . in general stable pm resident proteins degrade more slowly than actively recycling pm proteins because recycling pm proteins create more opportunities to contact other compartments and proteolytic enzymes located in the cytoplasm . the rate of _PROTEIN_ degradation was examined to confirm that most _PROTEIN_ proteins reside in the pm . because light causes the degradation of _METHOD_ due to conformational changes and also affects _METHOD_ signal by inducing a ph change in the _LOCATION_ we transferred _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic lines to the dark the respective transgenic lines were observed for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals and the time required for these proteins to be detected in the _LOCATION_ was measured . this time could reflect the degradation rate of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . sizable _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ containing vesicles were detected in the intracellular space of root epidermal cells h after transfer to the dark and the earliest _LOCATION_ accumulation was observed after h of darkness . in contrast _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ appeared in the _LOCATION_ within h of darkness . the pm and endocytic tracer have been shown to reach the _LOCATION_ tonoplast within h of dark treatment . when the roots of transgenic seedlings were treated with for the final h in the dark _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed colocalization with in the epidermal cell _LOCATION_ . wortmannin is an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositiol kinase and interferes with the endocytic process from the pm to the _LOCATION_ . wortmannin was used to acquire additional evidence for the _LOCATION_ targeting of _PROTEIN_ and also to compare the _LOCATION_ targeting of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in all of the seedlings observed treatment with wortmannin for h caused a relocalization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to wortmannin induced compartments . however the wortmannin sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ was different . only four out of seedlings responded to wortmannin within h whereas out of seedlings responded within h . in addition fewer wortmannin compartments were observed for _PROTEIN_ than for _PROTEIN_ . these results indicate that as with _PROTEIN_ the lytic _LOCATION_ pathway of _PROTEIN_ is dependent upon the phosphatidylinositol dependent pathway and the different sensitivities to wortmannin are likely due to differences in rates of endocytosis to the _LOCATION_ . kaede _PROTEIN_ was used to quantify _PROTEIN_ signals in the pm of root epidermal cells over time . green kaede _PROTEIN_ in the pm signals remained at of their initial value after h. however red kaede _PROTEIN_ signals in the pm were reduced to at h after uv photoactivation and this value continued until h with slight reduction . because we measured _PROTEIN_ signals in the pm without considering the _PROTEIN_ signal in the _LOCATION_ these data could restrictively provide the of _PROTEIN_ in the pm which is approximately h. in summary the _PROTEIN_ endocytic event to the _LOCATION_ is a slow process that is related to the stable anchoring of _PROTEIN_ in the pm . although _PROTEIN_ trafficking is responsive to bfa which induces the formation of internal _PROTEIN_ containing compartments a substantial proportion of the _PROTEIN_ signal remains in the pm . to determine how much of the _PROTEIN_ residing in the pm is resistant to bfa a quantitative confocal microscopy program was used to compare the intensities of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals in the respective areas of localization in the pm of bfa treated root epidermal cells . compared with the control _METHOD_ of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was retained in the pm after treatment with chx only and with cotreatments of chx and bfa . the pm _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was _PROTEIN_ to of the control value after chx treatment and cotreatment of chx and bfa reduced the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal in the pm to . in contrast cotreatment of chx and bfa reduced the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal in the pm to of the control level whereas chx alone slightly _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal to . the differential sensitivities to chx and/or bfa of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ indicate that their traffickings are differently regulated . because arf gefs such as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have been implicated in _PROTEIN_ trafficking their potential roles in _PROTEIN_ trafficking were investigated using the same bfa concentration as was used for individual experiments . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was introduced into the _PROTEIN_ myc line which is resistant to bfa . similar to observations in the wild type background application of bfa for h caused the formation of _PROTEIN_ containing bfa compartments in the bfa resistant _PROTEIN_ myc line . in the _PROTEIN_ myc line _PROTEIN_ did not aggregate in response to bfa because bfa sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ trafficking is regulated only by _PROTEIN_ . thus these data suggest that other bfa sensitive arf gefs are required for the bfa sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ trafficking although the involvement of _PROTEIN_ could not be completely ruled out . endocytosis of _PROTEIN_ is more affected by _PROTEIN_ a bfa insensitive arf gef than by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is not properly internalized to the bfa compartments in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . if _PROTEIN_ mediates the endocytosis of _PROTEIN_ bfa would not be expected to cause _PROTEIN_ internalization . the response of _PROTEIN_ to bfa for h did not differ significantly in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ backgrounds . these data indicate that unlike the _PROTEIN_ proteins _PROTEIN_ trafficking operates independently of _PROTEIN_ . it will be the next _PROTEIN_ to identify and characterize the responsible arf gefs for _PROTEIN_ trafficking . to determine whether the _LOCATION_ plays an important role in _PROTEIN_ trafficking we examined the effects of actin and microtubule inhibitors on the localization and the intracellular trafficking of _PROTEIN_ . cytochalasin d is an actin depolymerizing drug that affects the _PROTEIN_ localization and trafficking of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ signal barely responded to cytd for h whereas _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ signals showed intracellular aggregation under the same conditions . however an extended treatment of up to h induced the intracellular aggregation of _PROTEIN_ . in addition the effect of cytd on _PROTEIN_ trafficking was observed when cytd was cotreated with bfa the formation of _PROTEIN_ containing bfa compartments was considerably reduced in the presence of cytd . triiodobenzoic acid a weak auxin as well as an auxin transport inhibitor also inhibits endocytosis and vesicle motility by interfering with actin stabilization although _PROTEIN_ localization seemed to be unaffected by prolonged treatment with tiba alone . however pretreatment with tiba followed by cotreatment with bfa inhibited the formation of _PROTEIN_ containing bfa compartments in the root epidermis . similarly the bfa compartments of _PROTEIN_ were unable to disappear after washing out with tiba . in contrast to actin microtubules do not play a key role in _PROTEIN_ trafficking . the microtubule disrupting agent oryzalin did not significantly affect _PROTEIN_ trafficking . only higher concentrations of oryzalin could interfere with the _PROTEIN_ signal in the pm presumably by causing morphological changes to the cell . these data demonstrate that actin is involved in the endocytosis of _PROTEIN_ as well as in _PROTEIN_ s targeting to the pm but the reaction time and degree of intracellular aggregation of _PROTEIN_ after treatment with cytd are different from those of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ .
