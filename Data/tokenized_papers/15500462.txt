in plants the last step in the synthesis of p aminobenzoate _PROTEIN_ moiety of folate remains to be elucidated . in escherichia coli this step is catalyzed by the pabc protein a lyase that converts amino deoxychorismate the reaction product of the paba and pabb enzymes to _PROTEIN_ and pyruvate . so far the only known plant enzyme involved in _PROTEIN_ synthesis is adc synthase which has fused domains homologous to e. coli paba and pabb and is located in _LOCATION_ . adc synthase has no lyase activity implying that plants have a separate adc lyase . no such lyase is known in any eukaryote . genomic and phylogenetic approaches identified arabidopsis and tomato cdnas encoding pabc homologs with putative chloroplast targeting peptides . these cdnas were shown to encode functional enzymes by complementation of an e. coli pabc mutant and by demonstrating that the partially purified recombinant proteins convert adc to _PROTEIN_ . plant adc lyase is active as dimer and is not feedback inhibited by physiologic concentrations of _PROTEIN_ its _PROTEIN_ ester or folates . the full length arabidopsis adc lyase polypeptide was translocated into isolated pea chloroplasts and when fused to green _METHOD_ protein directed the passenger protein to arabidopsis chloroplasts in transient _PROTEIN_ experiments . these data indicate that adc lyase like adc synthase is present in _LOCATION_ . as shown previously for the adc synthase transcript the level of adc lyase mrna in the pericarp of tomato fruit falls sharply as ripening advances suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ of these two enzymes is coregulated .
