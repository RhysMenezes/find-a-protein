pollen grains protect the sperm cells inside them with the help of the unique cell wall the exine which exhibits enormous morphological variation across plant taxa assembling into intricate and diverse species specific patterns . how this complex _LOCATION_ structure is faithfully deposited at precise sites and acquires precise shape within a species is not understood . here we describe the isolation and characterization of the novel arabidopsis thaliana gene inaperturate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which is specifically involved in formation of the pollen surface apertures which arise by restriction of exine deposition at specific sites . loss of _PROTEIN_ leads to the loss of all three apertures in arabidopsis pollen and _PROTEIN_ protein exhibits a unique tripartite localization in developing pollen indicative of its direct involvement in specification of aperture positions . we also show that aperture length appears to be sensitive to _PROTEIN_ dosage and _PROTEIN_ misexpression can affect global exine patterning . phenotypes of some _PROTEIN_ mutants indicate that arabidopsis apertures are initiated at three nonrandom positions around the pollen equator . the identification of _PROTEIN_ opens up new avenues for studies of how formation of distinct cellular domains results in the production of different _LOCATION_ morphologies .
exine of arabidopsis pollen has a characteristic reticulate pattern interrupted at three equidistant positions by long and narrow apertures . previously in a forward genetic screen we isolated a large number of arabidopsis mutants defective in the production of pollen exine . among them were inaperturate mutants whose pollen appeared round rather than oval in a dry state and had normal reticulate exine patterning but completely lacked apertures . although these mutants were independently isolated from different batches of the mutagenized population they belonged to a single complementation group with the mutation linked to the molecular marker on chromosome . we now performed positional cloning with additional molecular markers on two of the lines and mapped the mutation to a kb interval between the markers and . we sequenced the genes located in this interval and found that one of them _GENE_ had a single nucleotide missing in both mapping lines . we called the gene _PROTEIN_ and named this mutant allele _PROTEIN_ . sequencing of the other inp mutant lines revealed that all but one carried an identical mutation in _GENE_ the remaining line was missing the nucleotide _PROTEIN_ . in both cases the mutations cause a frame shift in the beginning of the open reading frame and are expected to completely inactivate the gene . a t dna line with an insertion in the _GENE_ orf was available through the _PROTEIN_ . the pollen of this mutant had an identical inp phenotype _PROTEIN_ . all three mutants produced otherwise normal and fertile plants . transformation of the _PROTEIN_ mutant with the _PROTEIN_ gene under its own promoter conferred the wild type pollen phenotype in all transformants further confirming that _GENE_ is _PROTEIN_ and is required for the formation of pollen apertures . _PROTEIN_ encodes a amino acid protein . blast searches with the _PROTEIN_ protein sequence as a query and application of _METHOD_ designed to identify protein motifs and specific sequences revealed that it is a novel protein with no predicted sorting signal sequences . no other similar proteins exist in arabidopsis . whereas most domain search _METHOD_ did not identify any recognizable domains in _PROTEIN_ pfam predicted a plant specific delay of _PROTEIN_ domain in the _PROTEIN_ n terminus . the founding member of this domain family is associated with the control of seed dormancy . homologs of _PROTEIN_ exist in different plant species including a variety of eudicots monocots and possibly _METHOD_ but are absent from species outside the plant kingdom . also notably similar proteins are absent from the genomes of early land plant lineages such as the lycophyte selaginella moellendorfii _PROTEIN_ and the bryophyte physcomitrella patens which lack pollen but generate spores that are also covered by sporopollenin the major component of exine . absence of _PROTEIN_ in these lineages was in contrast with the other previously described mostly biosynthetic exine cytochromes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ male _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ acyl coa _PROTEIN_ no exine _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and thin of which are present throughout the land plant lineages and some are even found in algae . this suggests that the _PROTEIN_ gene was acquired relatively recently in plant evolutionary history after plants developed the ability to synthesize sporopollenin . similarly unlike the other exine genes that exhibit a high degree of sequence conservation in diverse species _PROTEIN_ is generally much less conserved . the amino acid sequence identity that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ shares with its homologs ranges from to for very closely related taxa to to and to to . interestingly in general the _PROTEIN_ proteins of eudicots are quite divergent _PROTEIN_ whereas _PROTEIN_ homologs from the monocot family poaceae are very conserved despite the fairly long evolutionary history of this family . sequence alignment of _PROTEIN_ proteins highlights the existence of generally conserved regions and of several highly divergent regions as well as the presence of the distinct areas of grass specific amino acids . we used the algorithm to predict secondary structures of the _PROTEIN_ proteins from arabidopsis cassava columbine monkey flower and rice . all of these proteins were predicted to have a similar fold with several helical regions and four to five short loop forming structurally disordered regions . interestingly all of the predicted disordered regions in each of the five _PROTEIN_ fell within the areas of high sequence divergence . although _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis is expected to be cytoplasmic the embl _PROTEIN_ phobius and tmpred _METHOD_ predicted the existence of a c terminal transmembrane domain in many of the _PROTEIN_ homologs from other plant families . therefore these proteins may be anchored to _LOCATION_ . all _PROTEIN_ homologs have a predicted _PROTEIN_ domain in their n termini . the only exception is a protein from the gymnosperm p. pinaster whose sequence may be incomplete and possibly misses its n terminus . another characteristic of the _PROTEIN_ proteins is a rather high content of leu residues which is on average and as high as in some species . this is comparable to the leu content of leu rich repeat arabidopsis proteins of similar size although the leu residues in _PROTEIN_ proteins do not form recognizable leu rich domains . however they are often conserved and present in the same relative positions in a variety of species of the most highly conserved amino acids in _PROTEIN_ are leu . in the genomes of members of the brassica genus in addition to a gene product very similar to _PROTEIN_ we identified three _PROTEIN_ like genes encoding more divergent proteins . transcripts of two of them were found in flower buds and anthers . these three predicted proteins share only to identity with _PROTEIN_ and differ from it about as much or more as its homologs from other plant families . however when their sequences were used as queries in blast against the arabidopsis genome _PROTEIN_ was pulled out as their only related protein . two of these proteins are more similar to each other and are quite different from . also the genomes of two other brassicaceae species eutrema parvulum and capsella rubella in addition to the predicted _PROTEIN_ orthologs each encode an ipl protein . these proteins are very divergent from the bona fide _PROTEIN_ orthologs from each other and from the ipl proteins from brassica rapa . therefore in some lineages of the brassicaceae family _PROTEIN_ has multiplied and diversified very rapidly . many of the genes involved in exine production particularly in sporopollenin synthesis exhibit strong coexpression . therefore we used coexpression _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to check if _PROTEIN_ is also _PROTEIN_ together with these genes . however _PROTEIN_ does not appear to be coexpressed with the genes known to be involved in exine formation . in _PROTEIN_ no gene exhibits strong coexpression correlation with _PROTEIN_ . based on the microarray transcription data _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ it is expected that _PROTEIN_ is a weakly _PROTEIN_ gene that has a somewhat increased _PROTEIN_ in developing flower buds and in pollen . according to the microarray analysis _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ at very low levels its highest _PROTEIN_ values in stage buds were only whereas the values for several sporopollenin synthesis genes also _PROTEIN_ at that stage ranged from to . we investigated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by placing a _PROTEIN_ gene under the _PROTEIN_ promoter . the _PROTEIN_ gus construct was _PROTEIN_ only in anthers with the earliest detectable signal in stage buds . the early signal was very weak and appeared to be confined to microspores . this signal continued through anther development becoming very prominent in the pollen of mature anthers . tapetum the secretory tissue in which components of exine and pollen coat are synthesized also exhibited a weak gus staining although at slightly _PROTEIN_ stages than microspores . no signal was detected in other flower tissues _METHOD_ leaves and siliques . pollen characteristics are influenced by both sporophytic and gametophytic genomes that function in diploid microspore mother cells /tapetum and in haploid microspores respectively . to check whether _PROTEIN_ determines aperture formation in a sporophytic or gametophytic manner we looked at the pollen of heterozygous _PROTEIN_ plants . _PROTEIN_ plants produced pollen with normal apertures suggesting that _PROTEIN_ functions sporophytically . this conclusion was confirmed by the analysis of the pollen tetrads generated by the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant . in these tetrads all four products of male meiosis held together due to the _PROTEIN_ mutation had normal apertures indicating that _PROTEIN_ acts in a sporophytic manner . given that the early transcript signal is located in microspores and that apertures are formed at the time when tetrads of microspores are enclosed by _PROTEIN_ callose walls the sporophytic _PROTEIN_ function necessary for aperture formation is likely internal coming from the diploid mmc and not provided externally by the diploid tapetum . to determine if _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ during male sporogenesis was sufficient to rescue _PROTEIN_ phenotypes the _PROTEIN_ gene was _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ plants under a male sporogenic line specific promoter _METHOD_ active in mmcs and microspores . the pollen of the transgenic plants had apertures restored indicating that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ during sporogenesis is sufficient to promote aperture development . to monitor the _PROTEIN_ subcellular localization we created a translational reporter _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and introduced it into the _PROTEIN_ mutant . importantly this reporter rescued the inaperturate phenotype of the mutant . we could not detect any _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in undivided mmcs mmcs undergoing meiosis and cytokinesis or in tapetum . yet _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ exhibited distinct punctate _METHOD_ in the tetrad stage and early free microspores . strikingly the _METHOD_ corresponded to three equidistant areas reminiscent of the positions of three apertures . at the tetrad stage _METHOD_ was restricted to the directly opposing areas of the neighboring microspores arranged in a tetrahedral formation those correspond to the positions where apertures develop . although single optical sections of microspores in tetrads or at the early free stage often revealed only three distinct _METHOD_ spots per microspore the reconstruction of serial z stacks demonstrated that _METHOD_ signal was restricted not just to three spots but to three long and narrow regions . those long areas of _METHOD_ could occasionally be observed in single sections as well depending on a microspore s positioning during a preparation . the three dimensional reconstruction and surface rendering from confocal z stacks of tetrads confirmed that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ puncta were underlying the positions of future long and narrow apertures which were already sometimes recognizable at the tetrad stage . these findings indicate that _PROTEIN_ is directly involved in specifying aperture positions . the aperture areas delineated by the _PROTEIN_ proteins had their centers at the contact points between microspores arranged in a tetrahedral tetrad conformation . in contrast with the transcriptional reporter _PROTEIN_ results we did not observe the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ translational reporter beyond the early free microspore stage . this discrepancy could be due to the high sensitivity of the gus reporter and the high stability of the gus protein . in parallel with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ we also introduced an _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ myc construct in the _PROTEIN_ plants with the idea to use it for future biochemical characterization of the protein . unexpectedly this construct provided an important insight into the mechanism of aperture formation . when unhydrated the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ inaperturate pollen can be easily distinguished at a low magnification under a dissection microscope with wild type pollen having an oval shape and inaperturate pollen having a round shape . surprisingly when we examined pollen generated by the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ myc transgenic plants we found some plants that produced pollen that appeared spheroidal intermediate between round and oval . out of the plants six plants were classified as having oval pollen as round and as having intermediate pollen . this prompted us to carefully examine the exine morphology in these lines with confocal microscopy . we found that the majority of the examined _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ myc _PROTEIN_ plants generated pollen in which apertures although restored were abnormal to some degree . most of these plants produced pollen with apertures that were shorter than in the wild type and in extreme cases were reduced to holes . therefore a gradient of aperture lengths could be envisioned across the transgenic lines . in these transgenic lines there were still three apertures present per pollen grain . the exceptional grains with one or two apertures were found on rare occasions only among the pollen of the lines with the hole like apertures . notably the three shortened apertures were located not randomly but were placed equidistantly with their centers close to the equators of the grains . this finding implies that three equidistant positions at the equator of microspores serve as the initiation points for formation and spreading of apertures . consistent with this prediction we found that in some tetrads that had thin intersporal callose walls and therefore likely had just recently undergone cytokinesis the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was limited to approximately three spots per microspore . since all the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ myc _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines contained the same construct the most likely explanation for the differences in the aperture lengths is the variations in the transgene _PROTEIN_ due to its insertions in different locations . this suggests an interpretation that aperture length is sensitive to the _PROTEIN_ dosage . the specific differences among the lines were present in both and generations and were therefore heritable . to test if aperture length varies in plants from the same line that differ in the number of _PROTEIN_ myc copies we used line that had short apertures in and a segregation of bastar bastas plants in consistent with the presence of a single insertion in the generation . we reasoned that potential low levels of functional _PROTEIN_ in that line might provide a sensitized background sufficient to see the difference in aperture length between one and two transgene insertions in . indeed among the bastar plants that were examined under a microscope we found some that produced pollen with short apertures and some that produced pollen with medium apertures . although the number of tested plants was small the segregation ratio of s to m plants was which would be expected if s plants were hemizygous and m plants were homozygous for transgene insertions . we measured the size of the apertures for several of these plants and found that plants classified as s had on average aperture length of to whereas plants classified as m had on average aperture length of to . similar differences between the aperture lengths of plants was also observed in an independent short aperturate line that also had a bastar bastas segregation . to confirm that the s plants from line had one transgene insertion and the m plants had two insertions we tested basta sensitivity of their progeny . all progeny of the m plants were resistant to basta whereas in the progeny of all s plants there was a segregation of bastar and bastas plants indicating that differences in aperture length in m and s plants can in _PROTEIN_ be attributed to the differences in the number of transgenes . we also compared the levels of the _PROTEIN_ myc transcripts in three lines that had different aperture lengths by performing quantitative rt pcr on rna extracted from stage buds . the _PROTEIN_ myc lines generated from the _PROTEIN_ background have both _PROTEIN_ myc and _PROTEIN_ alleles transcribed . therefore to ensure that the _PROTEIN_ myc transcript is specifically detected we used primer pairs that could distinguish between the endogenous mutant and transgenic wild type copies of _PROTEIN_ . different samples of stage buds were expected to have unequal combinations of different developmental stages of male germ line cells and therefore to likely vary in their _PROTEIN_ transcript levels . to compensate for stage differences between the samples we decided to use the endogenous _PROTEIN_ transcript rather than a housekeeping reference gene for normalization . with qrt pcr we observed a trend for correlation between the aperture length and the amount of the transcript with higher _PROTEIN_ levels present in the samples with longer apertures . taken together the results of the genetic analysis and qrt pcr strongly suggest that at low levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ aperture length depends on the _PROTEIN_ dosage . interestingly although we also observed differences in aperture length between individual lines in the case of other transgenes such as _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the variation among those lines was smaller than with _PROTEIN_ myc with most lines having wild type aperture length and some having medium sized apertures _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the very short apertures were only observed in the case of the _PROTEIN_ myc lines suggesting that the addition of the myc tag at the c terminus makes the effects of dosage dependence especially pronounced possibly by destabilizing interfering with transport or partially inactivating the _PROTEIN_ protein . although the vast majority of pollen grains in any given transgenic line had normal reticulate exine patterning and apertures of a relatively uniform length in multiple transgenic lines we also observed rare grains with global exine patterning defects and/or defective aperture margins . such abnormal pollen grains represented not more than a few percent of pollen populations but they were never observed in the morphologically uniform wild type or _PROTEIN_ pollen populations . for example grains with large abnormal holes and disrupted exine patterns like the ones shown on figures to were seen among the pollen with shortened apertures . such abnormal pollen grains were more often found among the lines with extremely short apertures . one possible explanation for the origin of these abnormalities is that microspores may be very sensitive to _PROTEIN_ concentrations above and/or below certain thresholds and that perhaps unequal distribution of the limited amounts of the _PROTEIN_ protein or mrna into microspores during meiosis contributes to differences in exine and aperture phenotypes . to test the effects of excessive _PROTEIN_ on aperture and exine formation we created _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines in the wild type or _PROTEIN_ backgrounds . _PROTEIN_ was sufficient to restore apertures in the _PROTEIN_ plants although like the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ myc and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines exhibited some variations in _METHOD_ of aperture lengths which varied from the wild type like to medium sized . the overwhelming majority of pollen grains in the _PROTEIN_ lines looked normal . although cauliflower mosaic virus is a strong constitutive promoter commonly used to overexpress genes in plants its _PROTEIN_ in anther tissues is somewhat controversial . the levels of _PROTEIN_ transcript in stage buds were significantly higher in the _PROTEIN_ lines than in the wild type however to prove that the construct is similarly overexpressed in tetrads is more _PROTEIN_ . therefore we can not rule out a possibility that levels of _PROTEIN_ within tetrads of microspores were not as high as typically expected with the construct . however it is of note that among the pollen of the _PROTEIN_ lines we also observed some that had ectopic apertures suggesting that excessive _PROTEIN_ might be sufficient at least to a partial extent for aperture formation . pollen with such defects was not seen in every line and when observed did not constitute more than to of pollen . defects in aperture margins or exine patterns similar to the ones shown for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ myc in figures to were also observed . abnormalities in aperture number morphology and/or exine structures were seen in different plants of the same line and found both in lines with the _PROTEIN_ and the wild type backgrounds . although it is not clear at the moment why some grains but not others generated by the same plant had these phenotypes we speculate that variations in the _PROTEIN_ dosage among microspores in particular too much _PROTEIN_ loaded in a microspore can result in pollen grains with ectopic apertures irregular aperture margins or abnormal exine patterning . more sensitive detection methods that can measure rna or protein concentrations in individual microspores will be required to test this hypothesis . apertures in pollen of different species often differ dramatically in their number and morphology . while many eudicots have a tricolpate configuration of apertures monocots often have a single aperture which in grasses has a shape of a round pore . the significant differences in the _PROTEIN_ sequences between eudicots and grasses led us to hypothesize that such sequence variations may be directly responsible for differences in aperture morphologies . to test this hypothesis we cloned the _PROTEIN_ homolog from the grass brachypodium distachyon and placed it under the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ promoter that had already allowed the successful _PROTEIN_ of gus _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ myc and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the resulting _PROTEIN_ bd _PROTEIN_ construct was transformed into the _PROTEIN_ plants and into the wild type arabidopsis and we monitored the aperture phenotypes in a large number of independent transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ . we confirmed the bd _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in stage buds in these transgenic plants . however the bd _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants had the same aperture phenotypes as their respective background lines indicating that bd _PROTEIN_ has no effect on apertures in arabidopsis pollen . we can not yet formally exclude the possibility that _PROTEIN_ homologs from grasses are simply not involved in aperture formation . however given the _PROTEIN_ that bd _PROTEIN_ is the only _PROTEIN_ related gene in the brachypodium genome the high degree of conservation of the _PROTEIN_ homologs within the grass family and the distinct shape of apertures in the pollen of grasses the more likely interpretation of this result is that additional _PROTEIN_ have coevolved with the _PROTEIN_ homologs and are also required to control aperture formation and/or specify aperture morphology .
positional cloning was used to map _PROTEIN_ in two independently isolated inp arabidopsis thaliana lines using populations generated by crossing the mutants with landsberg _LOCATION_ wild type plants . bulked segregant analysis revealed linkage to the marker on chromosome . fine mapping of _PROTEIN_ in plants with additional markers placed it in a kb region between the markers and . orfs of the genes from this interval were sequenced and a polymorphism relative to the wild type columbia was found in _GENE_ . this polymorphism was present in all but one lines forming the _PROTEIN_ complementation group . it resulted in the creation of a saci site and allowed us to generate a cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence marker which was used to verify the presence of the _PROTEIN_ mutation in the subsequent experiments with transgenic constructs _PROTEIN_ . for the list of primers used in this study see supplemental table online . the remaining mutant line had a different nucleotide absent in _GENE_ . the _PROTEIN_ complementation construct was produced by amplifying the _PROTEIN_ genomic region including the orf nucleotides upstream of orf and nucleotides downstream of the stop codon _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ . pcr product was digested with bamhi agei and incorporated in a modified binary vector _PROTEIN_ . to create the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct the _PROTEIN_ gene was amplified with primers _PROTEIN_ cf and _PROTEIN_ fr digested with bamhi agei and placed into _PROTEIN_ upstream of the _METHOD_ gene . the _PROTEIN_ gus construct was produced by amplifying the nucleotide region upstream of _PROTEIN_ orf _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ digesting with bamhi/agei and incorporating it into the gus _PROTEIN_ vector . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct was produced by amplifying the _PROTEIN_ gene with primers _PROTEIN_ ef and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ digesting the product with agei ncoi and incorporating it into agei ncoi digested _PROTEIN_ this was followed by amplification of the _METHOD_ promoter with primers _METHOD_ f and _METHOD_ r digestion of the product with saci agei and incorporation into the saci agei digested _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to create the _PROTEIN_ construct the agei ncoi digested _PROTEIN_ fragment was placed into a modified binary vector containing the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter _PROTEIN_ . to create the myc tagged _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ gene was amplified with primers pst _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and not _PROTEIN_ hr digested with psti noti and subcloned into psti noti digested pcmv/myc/mito vector . the resulting _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ myc was cut out with saci agei and incorporated into _PROTEIN_ . to create the _PROTEIN_ bd _PROTEIN_ construct the _PROTEIN_ homolog from brachypodium distachyon was amplified using primers and _PROTEIN_ in the presence of _METHOD_ digested with ncoi spei and replaced the gus gene in the _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ construct . all constructs were verified by sequencing and transformed into the agrobacterium strain . wild type columbia or _PROTEIN_ plants were then transformed by floral dip method transgenic plants were selected with _PROTEIN_ and the presence of transgenes was confirmed with specific primers . to identify _PROTEIN_ homologs in other species we used blast searches against the national center for biotechnology information databases multiple plant species genomes available in the phytozome database and genomes of theobroma cacao and fragaria vesca . protein sequences were aligned using clustalw . signalp phobius tmpred prosite interproscan pfam and lrrfinder were used to search for domains or signal sequences . was used to predict protein secondary structures . in addition to the true _PROTEIN_ gene present on chromosome of brassica rapa three other _PROTEIN_ like genes clustered on chromosome were found . for b. rapa and brassica napus blast identified three ests of two types _PROTEIN_ in floral buds and anthers that encoded putative proteins with similarity to arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ . by searching the sequenced genomic clones of b. rapa we were able to identify a third protein sequence with similarity to _PROTEIN_ . in the recently released sequenced genome of b. rapa these three genes are annotated as and respectively . the annotation predicts second exons in each of these _PROTEIN_ like genes which encode the c terminal sequences unrelated to _PROTEIN_ . the presence of these exons is also suggested by the existence of the est from b. napus . to check for _PROTEIN_ coexpression with other genes bar _PROTEIN_ angler _PROTEIN_ ii and prime coexpression _METHOD_ were used . to visualize aperture and exine morphology pollen was stained with auramine o and observed with an olympus fluoview confocal laser scanning microscope as previously described . for aperture length measurements in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ myc plants photographs of to pollen grains per plant were taken and lengths of short to medium apertures were measured using the straight line tool in _PROTEIN_ imagej . to visualize _METHOD_ _METHOD_ mmcs tetrads and free microspores were dissected from anthers and placed in a drop of vectashield mounting medium with diamidino phenylindole under a cover slip and observed with a leica confocal microscope . dapi transiently stained the outsides of the microspores and this staining was used for surface rendering . a total of to z sections were collected . z stack images were processed with _PROTEIN_ imagej or for three dimensional surface rendering with _PROTEIN_ software . gus staining was performed as previously described . total rna was extracted from stage buds with _PROTEIN_ reagent following the manufacturer s instructions . rna concentration was determined via spectrophotometry using nanodrop . to remove any contaminating genomic dna of rna was treated with units of dnase in reactions at for min followed by addition of of dnase stop solution and dnase inactivation at for min . the dnase treated rna was reverse transcribed with the help of the masterscript kit in a reaction in the presence of deoxynucleotide triphosphate rapid amplification of cdna ends _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ prime rnase inhibitor and masterscript reverse transcriptase . the reactions were performed at for h. for each cdna sample the absence of genomic dna was verified by pcr with the intron flanking _PROTEIN_ primers . to detect the _PROTEIN_ transcript by traditional rt pcr first strand cdna was amplified in reactions in qiagen pcr buffer in the presence of mm deoxynucleotide triphosphate each of primers _PROTEIN_ ef and dr and unit of taq polymerase . to distinguish between the _PROTEIN_ transcripts from the endogenous mutant copies and from the _PROTEIN_ myc transgene pcr reactions were diluted twofold with water and digested with saci that cuts the _PROTEIN_ version of _PROTEIN_ but not the wild type one . although we were able to amplify _PROTEIN_ transcripts several times the process was _PROTEIN_ and required a lot of optimization likely due to _PROTEIN_ being _PROTEIN_ at very low level in a limited number of cells and in a dynamic fashion . to measure _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in lines primer pairs _PROTEIN_ ef and dr as well as _PROTEIN_ gf and _PROTEIN_ were used . to confirm bd _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ primers bf and _PROTEIN_ were used . for qrt pcr cdna samples were prepared as above and equivalents of ng of initial rna were amplified in reactions using faststart universal sybr green master mix on real time pcr system _METHOD_ . to amplify the wild type transcript of the _PROTEIN_ myc transgene the primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lr were used . to amplify the transcript of the endogenous mutant _PROTEIN_ gene the primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lr were used . the specificity of the primers was confirmed with pcr and qpcr reactions done on the wild type and _PROTEIN_ genomic dna with both sets of primers . qrt pcr cycling conditions included an initial incubation at for min followed by cycles of for s and for min . for each _PROTEIN_ myc line four biological replicates and two technical replicates were used . after qrt pcr the amounts of both transcripts were calculated relative to standard curves obtained for serial dilutions of the wild type and _PROTEIN_ genomic dnas respectively . for each sample the amounts of the _PROTEIN_ myc transgenic transcripts were then normalized to the amounts of the endogenous _PROTEIN_ transcripts . accession numbers for sequences from this article can be found in supplemental table online . the
