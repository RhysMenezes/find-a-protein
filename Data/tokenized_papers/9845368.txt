the mechanism by which the phytochrome photoreceptor family transduces informational light signals to photoresponsive genes is unknown . using a yeast two hybrid screen we have identified a phytochrome interacting _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a basic helix loop helix protein containing a _PROTEIN_ domain . _PROTEIN_ binds to wild type c terminal domains of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but less strongly to signaling defective missense mutant containing domains . _PROTEIN_ of sense or antisense _PROTEIN_ sequences in transgenic arabidopsis perturbs photoresponsiveness in a manner indicating that _PROTEIN_ functions in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ signaling pathways in vivo . _PROTEIN_ localized to the _LOCATION_ in transient transfection experiments indicating a potential role in controlling gene _PROTEIN_ . together the data suggest that phytochrome signaling to photoregulated genes includes a direct pathway involving physical interaction between the photoreceptor and a transcriptional regulator .
based on the evidence that the c terminal domain of the phytochromes may be directly involved in interactions with signaling partners we used this domain of _PROTEIN_ as bait in the yeast two hybrid system to screen an arabidopsis cdna library . from colonies screened were isolated that were both his and galactosidase positive after rescue in e. coli and retransformation back into yeast . one _PROTEIN_ was selected here for further study . plate growth assays on minus his medium indicate that _PROTEIN_ interacts with the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ c terminal domain in a selective manner as no interaction was detected with the control protein . on the other hand _PROTEIN_ does cross interact with the c terminal domains of both rice _PROTEIN_ and arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ . data from a pull down experiment using _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins synthesized by in vitro transcription/translation support the conclusion that _PROTEIN_ interacts directly with the photoreceptor molecules . because of the evidence that point mutations clustering in the core region of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ disrupt signal transfer to downstream components in vivo we tested whether a representative set of these mutations would interfere with the binding of _PROTEIN_ to the photoreceptor molecules . citation shows that each of the selected mutations substantially reduced the interaction of the three phytochromes tested in the quantitative yeast two hybrid assay . western blot analysis shows that this reduction is not due to reduced _PROTEIN_ levels of the mutant proteins . the coding sequence of the original _PROTEIN_ cdna isolated in the two hybrid screen appeared to be incomplete at the end . however several clones subsequently isolated from a cdna library appeared to contain a complete protein coding sequence and to be close to full length based on comparison to the single kb transcript detected on northern blots . southern blot analysis indicated that _PROTEIN_ is likely a single copy gene . we sequenced the _PROTEIN_ gene determined its structure by comparison to the cdna and mapped it to chromosome near _PROTEIN_ using an arrayed yac library . subsequently the sequence of a bac designated containing the _PROTEIN_ gene has been deposited in the databases . this bac represents this same region of chromosome thus verifying the location of _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ protein contains a region of strong homology to the dna binding and dimerization domains of the bhlh protein superfamily . this sequence similarity is clear in alignments with sequences from a variety of _METHOD_ including two known _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ also contains a classical bipartite _LOCATION_ localization signal motif . outside the bhlh domain _PROTEIN_ has little sequence similarity to other known proteins except for a region of limited similarity to a single _PROTEIN_ domain in the n terminal half of the molecule . it is of interest that the strongest similarities are with the _PROTEIN_ domains of the phytochromes and the _PROTEIN_ photoreceptor . a prominent subclass of bhlh proteins including the clock proteins arnt _PROTEIN_ and bmal contain _PROTEIN_ domains but the molecular architecture is different than that of _PROTEIN_ . to test for _PROTEIN_ involvement in phytochrome signaling in vivo we generated multiple independent transgenic arabidopsis lines _PROTEIN_ either sense or antisense _PROTEIN_ cdna sequences driven by the camv promoter and assayed for photoresponsiveness . transgenic lines segregating for a single t dna locus as determined by basta resistance were selected for further analysis and for production of progeny homozygous for the transgenic locus . citation shows rc and frc fluence rate response curves for one homozygous _PROTEIN_ sense line and one homozygous _PROTEIN_ antisense line compared to wild type . the data indicate that the _PROTEIN_ sense line is marginally more sensitive to rc and frc of higher fluence rates . by contrast the _PROTEIN_ antisense line displays a striking reduction in sensitivity to rc with a significant but less pronounced effect of frc primarily at lower fluence rates . the absence of any difference from wild type in dark grown seedlings establishes that these phenotypic differences are light dependent . moreover examination of segregating populations of the and lines for photoresponsiveness coupled with assay of individual seedlings from these populations by pcr for the presence of the transgene established that these light dependent phenotypes cosegregate with the t dna insertion . we examined several other independent transgenic lines homozygous for the transgene for consistency of the phenotypes observed for and . all additional sense lines exhibited marginally enhanced sensitivity to rc and frc similar to that of albeit somewhat less pronounced . all sense lines _PROTEIN_ substantially elevated levels of _PROTEIN_ mrna relative to wild type . similarly the additional antisense lines exhibited reduced rc and frc sensitivity qualitatively similar to that of . the strength of the phenotype is roughly correlated with the extent of the reduction in _PROTEIN_ transcript levels in the antisense lines . these data indicate that the phenotypes observed are unlikely to be due to inadvertant disruption of an endogenous gene by the t dna insert and are most likely due to increases or _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ levels generated by _PROTEIN_ of the sense and antisense _PROTEIN_ sequences respectively . similarly the absence of differences in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ levels between the wild type and transgenic lines indicates that the phenotypes are not due to indirect effects of the _PROTEIN_ sense or antisense constructs on photoreceptor levels . in addition to the long hypocotyl phenotype induced by _PROTEIN_ antisense _PROTEIN_ we also observed diminished rates of light induced hook opening and cotyledon separation reduced cotyledon expansion and early flowering . to determine whether the involvement of _PROTEIN_ in phytochrome signaling could be observed at the gene _PROTEIN_ level we selected three genes whose light regulated _PROTEIN_ has been well studied two positively regulated genes cab and _PROTEIN_ and one negatively regulated gene _PROTEIN_ . citation shows that all three genes are regulated in the expected fashion in wild type seedlings . cab and _PROTEIN_ mrna levels are strongly enhanced and _PROTEIN_ mrna levels are reduced in both rc and frc consistent with the involvement of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in this regulation . by contrast the photoresponsiveness of all three genes is altered to a greater or lesser extent in the _PROTEIN_ antisense line . a clear reduction in the extent of cab and _PROTEIN_ induction as well as of _PROTEIN_ repression relative to wild type is observed in the line in response to rc . similar but less pronounced reductions in the effectiveness of frc on cab and _PROTEIN_ induction are also apparent in the line relative to wild type while no detectable effects on _PROTEIN_ repression are observed . similar results were obtained in three separate experiments . because of the sequence similarity of _PROTEIN_ to members of the _LOCATION_ localized bhlh family and the presence of a putative bipartite nls we examined the subcellular localization of a _PROTEIN_ gus fusion in a transient transfection assay using onion epidermal cells . the data show that under continuous white light the _PROTEIN_ gus protein is strongly localized to the _LOCATION_ in these cells in contrast to the gus protein alone . in other experiments involving a terminal fr pulse irradiation and dark incubation after bombardment the _PROTEIN_ gus fusion protein was also strongly localized to the _LOCATION_ indicating the absence of phytochrome regulated control of localization in these cells .
