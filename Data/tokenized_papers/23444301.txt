the thioredoxin system is known to play a pivotal role in cellular redox regulation but its target proteins in plant mitochondria remain largely uncharacterized . in this study we systemically screened trx target candidates in plant mitochondria . mitochondrial protein extracts were prepared from arabidopsis shoots spinach leaves and potato tubers and then subfractionated into soluble _PROTEIN_ and insoluble _LOCATION_ fractions . protein extracts were loaded onto an affinity column immobilizing arabidopsis mitochondria localized o type trx mutant protein in which one of two internal cysteines at the active site was substituted by serine . proteins forming mixed disulfide intermediates with the mutated trx were identified by proteomic approaches . this procedure allowed the determination of trx target candidate proteins involved in a broad spectrum of mitochondrial processes . furthermore biochemical assay revealed that one of the potential trx target proteins alternative oxidase is actually redox regulated by trx . this study provides insights into the regulatory mechanism of diverse functions in mitochondrial biology that are mediated through the trx system .
in the dithiol disulfide exchange reaction between trx and its target protein the n terminal cysteine residue of the trx active site _METHOD_ a mixed disulfide intermediate with the target protein which is subsequently broken by nucleophilic attack by the second cysteine residue . the trx mutant in which the second cysteine is substituted by serine can interrupt this reduction process at the stage of the mixed disulfide intermediate . in trx affinity chromatography the trx cs mutant is immobilized on the resin and used as a bait . for the purpose of this study the arabidopsis mitochondria localized o type trx cs mutant was _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli and purified as described in the materials and methods . in order to screen trx targets a significant amount of mitochondrial protein extracts was required . intact mitochondria were thus isolated from three sources and subfractionated into soluble _PROTEIN_ and insoluble _LOCATION_ fractions . the _LOCATION_ proteins were solubilized using a mild detergent n octyl d _PROTEIN_ . the efficiencies of the fractionation and solubilization were validated by immunoblotting using marker antibodies . the integral _LOCATION_ proteins cytochrome c oxidase subunit ii _PROTEIN_ and alternative oxidase _PROTEIN_ were virtually exclusively detected in the solubilized _LOCATION_ fraction . on the other hand the photorespiratory enzyme glycine decarboxylase complex h protein was detected in the _PROTEIN_ fraction . the peripheral _LOCATION_ protein _PROTEIN_ synthase subunit was detected in both _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ fractions . in arabidopsis mitochondria _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis was also performed . following electrophoresis major protein spots or bands were randomly excised from the gel then subjected to tryptic digestion and peptide _METHOD_ fingerprint analysis . the identified proteins are listed in supplementary table . in the solubilized _LOCATION_ fraction well known mitochondrial _LOCATION_ proteins including _PROTEIN_ synthase subunits complex i subunits and _PROTEIN_ carrier protein were identified . two _PROTEIN_ anhydrases recently described as the complex i subunit were also found in this fraction . on the other hand several proteins involved in the tca cycle and photorespiratory metabolism were detected in the _PROTEIN_ fraction . as expected from immunoblotting results both fractions contained the peripheral _LOCATION_ protein _PROTEIN_ synthase subunit . taken together the _PROTEIN_ and integral _LOCATION_ proteins were separated into the corresponding fractions while the peripheral _LOCATION_ proteins were included in both fractions . using the trx and mitochondrial protein extracts we performed trx affinity chromatography . specific interaction between trx target candidate proteins and the immobilized trx mutant has already been confirmed using the trx mutant immobilized resin and thiol sepharose resin in our previous report . fig . shows _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ profiles of proteins eluted from each trx affinity chromatography step using mitochondrial protein extracts in arabidopsis . most proteins did not interact with trx . after washing steps for removing non specifically bound proteins the proteins forming mixed disulfide intermediate with the trx were eluted by dithiothreitol . dtt eluted proteins were subjected to further analyses as trx target candidates . proteins obtained as the trx target candidate in arabidopsis mitochondria were concentrated by precipitation using trichloroacetic acid and separated by two dimensional isoelectric focusing /sds _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or one dimensional _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ . the protein spots and bands indicated in fig . were successfully identified by pmf analysis . these results are listed in table . more detailed information _METHOD_ _METHOD_ is provided in supplementary tables _PROTEIN_ and supplementary data _LOCATION_ . in parallel with these pmf analyses we examined the n terminal edman sequence of dtt eluted proteins . the successfully determined proteins in arabidopsis are described in fig . and for details of matches in supplementary table . most of the proteins identified by n terminal sequencing overlapped with those determined by pmf analysis but four proteins were identified by the latter method alone . n terminal sequencing was also applied to identify trx target candidates in spinach and potato . most of the proteins identified were also found in arabidopsis but several unique proteins were characterized in the heterotrophic potato tuber . in total we determined proteins as trx target candidates in plant mitochondria . among them arabidopsis proteins were validated for their subcellular localization by referring to the _PROTEIN_ localization database for arabidopsis protein _PROTEIN_ . this database covers all experimental and computer prediction data for subcellular localizations of arabidopsis proteins . the majority of proteins identified here were experimentally assigned to the mitochondrial proteome but some were not . mitochondrial localization of such unassigned proteins however can not be excluded trx affinity chromatography enables trx interacting proteins to be concentrated and therefore relatively enriched in the protein mixture and it _METHOD_ possible that even low abundance protein which are inherently difficult to be detected reach detectable levels . in addition mitochondrial localization was supported by targeting prediction tools in most cases even where experimental evidence is not available . as described in tables we grouped whole trx target candidates into biological processes and compared our results with those of two closely related studies citation and citation . we briefly discuss the possible regulatory manner and involvement of trx system in _METHOD_ of the control of each process . we identified four subunits of _PROTEIN_ synthase as potential trx targets . while and subunits have already been shown to interact with trx and glutaredoxin the subunit is a new trx linked candidate in mitochondria . according to citation and subunits form multimeric complexes linked by intermolecular disulfide bridges under oxidized conditions . in chloroplast _PROTEIN_ synthase the trx mediated thiol modulation of the subunit has been well established . in this case two adjacent cysteines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are involved in the redox regulation but these are not conserved in the mitochondrial counterpart . several subunits forming electron transport complexes were also identified as target candidates of trx . to our knowledge mitochondrial _LOCATION_ fractions have not previously been used for screening for trx interacting proteins . thus most of these subunits are new trx target candidates . it has been shown in mammals that complex i elevates the activity in the presence of reductants and _METHOD_ mixed disulfides with glutathione supporting the possibility of redox regulation of this complex . furthermore non energy conserving respiratory components _PROTEIN_ and uncoupling protein _PROTEIN_ were isolated as trx linked proteins . it is well known that in the oxidized inactive form _PROTEIN_ exists as a homodimer linked by an intermolecular disulfide bridge . on the other hand the regulatory mechanism of _PROTEIN_ is not fully understood . however _PROTEIN_ activity has been shown to be stimulated under oxidative stress . our result suggests that trx may mediate the modulation of _PROTEIN_ activity in response to a change in mitochondrial redox states . twelve proteins involved in the tca cycle and associated reactions were captured as potential trx targets . among them citrate synthase oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex subunit and fumarate hydratase are new trx interacting candidates in higher plants . it is worth pointing out that cs is able to form both intra and intermolecular disulfide bridges under oxidized conditions . also in chlamydomonas the ogdc subunit was shown to bind to trx . it is known that several tca cycle enzymes are inactivated under oxidative stress conditions . for example aconitase activity is inhibited by hydrogen peroxide . furthermore the lipid peroxidation product hydroxy nonenal inactivates pdc and ogdc through modification of the cysteine residue in lipoic acid moieties . gdc h protein and branched chain keto acid dehydrogenase subunit are also known to contain lipoic acid moieties both of which were found to interact with trx . interaction of trx with these proteins suggests that the trx system engages in the protection and regeneration from oxidative modifications . it has been shown that the tca cycle flux in vivo is altered depending on environmental conditions such as light . it is worth investigating whether trx dependent redox regulation may be involved in such flux modulations . photorespiratory glycine oxidation by the combined action of gdc and serine hydroxymethyl transferase is a major metabolic pathway in green leaf mitochondria . as achieved by citation all gdc subunits and shmt were trapped by trx affinity chromatography . an early study reported that gdc activity is dependent on dtt supporting the possibility that trx controls gdc activity as a physiological redox switch . h protein which contains the lipoic acid moiety was experimentally demonstrated to be susceptible to oxidative stress . furthermore p protein was shown to be glutathionylated at several cysteine residues resulting in the _PROTEIN_ in gdc activity . ten proteins related to amino acid metabolism were trapped by trx affinity chromatography . glutamine synthetase has been shown to be activated in the presence of dtt and to interact with chloroplast trx . _PROTEIN_ was historically believed to be targeted only to chloroplasts but citation reported that this protein is in _PROTEIN_ dual targeted to chloroplasts and mitochondria . mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ is thought to be beneficial for recycling ammonium the toxic metabolite generated during photorespiration . o acetylserine lyase is a constituent of the cysteine synthase complex that produces cysteine from acetyl coa and serine . oas tl exists as a homodimer which can be dissociated under reduced conditions . other trx linked candidate proteins were hydroxyisobutyryl coa hydrolase arginase mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase and methylcrotonoyl coa _PROTEIN_ subunit which are involved in valine arginine methionine and leucine metabolism respectively . taken together these results suggest that the trx system potentially plays a broad regulatory role in mitochondrial amino acid metabolism . a novel metabolic pathway the aminobutyric acid shunt _METHOD_ to play an important role in conferring a flexible network with other metabolic pathways especially under stress conditions . in this study gaba transaminase was newly identified as a trx target candidate . biochemical characterization of gaba t was recently achieved in part but the involvement of redox regulation remains to be addressed . _PROTEIN_ and trx o which were detected in the dtt eluate are key players in the redox regulation system in mitochondria . the elution of trx o by dtt implies that trx o derived from mitochondrial extracts might form a homodimer with the recombinant trx immobilized to the resin . in _PROTEIN_ it was demonstrated that trx can form a homodimer or an even higher order oligomer in vitro and in vivo which allows trx to act as a molecular chaperone . a notable partner protein of trx is the cystathionine synthase domain containing protein _PROTEIN_ . it was recently demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ can activate trx o activity through physical interaction . we identified nine proteins involved in the antioxidant defense system as potential trx targets . peroxiredoxin iif _PROTEIN_ was already shown to interact with trx o which ensures detoxification with high efficiency . although glutathione peroxidase was initially defined as gsh dependent it can receive reducing equivalents from trx . the methionine sulfoxide reductase _METHOD_ was also shown to be supplied with reducing equivalents by trx which enables _METHOD_ to function in the regeneration of oxidized methionine . the stromal/mitochondrial ascorbate peroxidase is a new mitochondrial trx target candidate although _LOCATION_ apx has been demonstrated to interact with trx . citation showed that trx has a negative impact on apx activity . taken together it is highly plausible that the trx system is broadly associated with antioxidant proteins in mitochondria . adp/atp carrier protein _PROTEIN_ voltage dependent anion channel carnitine/acylcarnitine carrier protein and phosphate transporter were identified as trx linked carrier proteins in mitochondria . although cross talk with trx has not been shown to date citation found that _PROTEIN_ and pit can form inter and intramolecular disulfide bridges respectively under oxidized conditions . they also proposed that on the basis of the comparison with the mammalian counterpart the n terminal cysteine in _PROTEIN_ is likely to engage in the intermolecular disulfide formation . iron sulfur cluster containing proteins are involved in numerous biological processes such as electron transfer . five proteins involved in the biosynthesis of fe s clusters were identified as trx target candidates . although the roles of these proteins in the mitochondrial fe s cluster biosynthesis have not been completely assigned they are likely to be associated with several distinct steps including cysteine disulfurase activity and a scaffolding function . several chaperones from distinct _METHOD_ have been characterized to be redox regulated . in this study nine chaperones and processing related proteins were implied to be regulated by the trx system . mitochondrial elongation _PROTEIN_ tu and two chaperones _PROTEIN_ were previously shown to interact with trx or grx . among them ef tu was shown to form an intramolecular disulfide bridge under oxidized conditions . in cyanobacteria ef g activity is promoted depending on trx which supports an efficient psii repair cycle . it should be noted that in addition to a potential regulatory role trx can directly operate as a chaperone by formation of an oligomeric structure . the pentatricopeptide repeat _PROTEIN_ protein participates in the post transcriptional rna modification . to our knowledge there is so far no critical information on the regulatory mode of _PROTEIN_ protein activity . we found here that two mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ proteins encoded by _GENE_ and _GENE_ genes are potentially redox regulated by the trx system . _PROTEIN_ protein _GENE_ is required for cis splicing of mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ intron . as described above we successfully identified a large number of trx linked proteins in mitochondria . however these are still potential trx targets and a more detailed confirmation procedure is required to _PROTEIN_ these as true targets . we thus examined whether _PROTEIN_ is actually reduced by trx . for this purpose recombinant wild type trx and trx were constructed and they were confirmed to be functional by the insulin reduction assay . for _PROTEIN_ reduction trx was mixed with an arabidopsis mitochondrial _LOCATION_ fraction and various concentrations of dtt . the redox state of _PROTEIN_ was then visualized by non reducing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and immunoblotting . in the absence of trx _PROTEIN_ was substantially reduced only when high concentrations of dtt were added . on the other hand _PROTEIN_ could be reduced by much lower concentrations of dtt in the presence of trx . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is a true trx target . trx dependent reduction of _PROTEIN_ was previously suggested in poplar and pea . as the regulatory cysteine for dimer formation in _PROTEIN_ is highly conserved in plants redox regulation of _PROTEIN_ through the trx system appears to be a ubiquitous regulatory mechanism . we have shown that in a shade species alocasia odora oxidized dimeric _PROTEIN_ is converted to the reduced monomeric form under high light conditions . therefore a possible in vivo scenario is that high light elevates the mitochondrial reduction level via cross talk with chloroplasts then drives the mitochondrial trx system and finally switches _PROTEIN_ to the active mode . _PROTEIN_ activation is thought to be important for high light acclimation by functioning as a dissipating system of excess reducing equivalents in photosynthetic cells . in the present study we successfully identified a large number of trx target candidates in plant mitochondria . these candidates are linked to multiple biological processes implying that redox regulation through the trx system has a broad impact on the mitochondrial activity . furthermore we showed that _PROTEIN_ is actually redox regulated via the trx system . using the list obtained in this study as a platform the trx dependent regulatory _METHOD_ of other target candidates should be investigated in detail . in addition to in vitro biochemical analyses in vivo studies are necessary to gain physiological insights into how the mitochondrial trx system operates and regulates its target proteins in response to environmental stimuli .
