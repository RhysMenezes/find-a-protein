the eukaryotic _LOCATION_ has been proposed to be organized by two interdependent nucleoprotein structures the chromatin and the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . the functional composition and molecular organization of the second component have not yet been resolved . here we describe the isolation of the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ from the model plant arabidopsis its initial characterization by confocal and electron microscopy and the identification of proteins by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . electron microscopy of resinless samples confirmed a structure very similar to that described for the animal _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . gel electrophoresis resolved approximately protein spots . proteins were identified in batches by esi tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ after resolution by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . among the identified proteins were a number of demonstrated or predicted arabidopsis homologs of nucleolar proteins such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fibrillarins nucleolin as well as ribosomal components and a putative histone deacetylase . others included homologs of _PROTEIN_ and dnaj which have also been identified in the nucleolus or _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ of human cells as well as a number of novel proteins with unknown function . this study is the first proteomic approach towards the characterization of a higher plant _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . it demonstrates the striking similarities both in structure and protein composition of the operationally defined _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ across _METHOD_ whose unicellular ancestors have separated more than one billion years ago . j . cell . biochem . . inc .
to isolate the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ fraction from arabidopsis suspension culture cells we adopted the protocol of mirkovitch et al . modified _PROTEIN_ for tobacco cells . this protocol exploits the lithium and digitonin extraction of chromatin proteins . its _PROTEIN_ advantage over extraction of chromatin proteins is a lower risk of artifactual precipitation of _LOCATION_ proteins . however the ultrastructures revealed by both methods show a marked similarity in the underlying network of branched nm filaments . the isolation procedure was monitored by brightfield and _METHOD_ microscopy . propidium iodide _PROTEIN_ staining was used to monitor the presence of _LOCATION_ acids and dapi staining to distinguish between dna and rna . _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ showed significant reduction of dapi _METHOD_ indicating the successful removal of genomic dna . the remaining propidium iodide _METHOD_ was concentrated in the nucleolar _PROTEIN_ likely corresponding to rna . resinless section electron microscopy was used to determine the ultrastructural appearance of the material . the structures showed a network of fibers well distributed through the entire body of the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and connected to the nucleolar _PROTEIN_ . at higher magnification the fibers of the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ appear of different diameter and are covered in multiple protrusions . in a number of regions a more dense fibrillonuclear network can be seen intermixed with regions of a more loose organization . together the ultrastructure of the isolated arabidopsis _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ closely resembles that described from other _METHOD_ . the protein profile of the arabidopsis _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ was compared to whole _LOCATION_ by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the bands corresponding to the core histones and histone are absent from the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ fraction indicating the proper extraction of soluble and proteins . most _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ proteins appear in the size range from to kda . an antiserum against a _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ protein from tomato detects a single protein of the expected size kda which is retained in the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ fraction . as a negative control to eliminate the possibility of contamination we used an antiserum against reductase a protein located in chloroplasts . even though it detected a protein of the correct size in both the arabidopsis whole cell extract and a chloroplast preparation it did not detect this protein in both _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ fraction . the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ is by definition highly insoluble . we developed a solubilization protocol compatible with isoelectric focussing and resolved a sample by . in total individual spots could be identified after image enhancement with the pdquest computer program confirming the expected complexity of this _LOCATION_ fraction . the most abundant proteins were found predominantly in the range of pi pi and of kda as shown in the insets in figure . figure shows an immunoblot with the antibody confirming the presence of this protein in the analyzed fraction . after detection a stronger signal likely to correspond to the _PROTEIN_ protein isoform and a weaker signal shifted towards the basic region of the gel could be seen . because tomato was shown to contain six predicted protein kinase _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation sites it is possible that this electrophoretic behavior indicates the existence of phosphorylated variants of this protein within the context of the a. thaliana _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . additional experiments might pinpoint the actual sites for phosphorylation and the kinase responsible for this potential activity . three of the most abundant protein spots were selected for coring from a corresponding _METHOD_ gel resulting in the identification of five proteins . because identification of proteins from is biased towards soluble proteins samples for protein identification were instead resolved on _PROTEIN_ polyacrylamide gels . the gels were stained with _METHOD_ blue and seven sections were excised and submitted for tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis . this analysis was repeated two to four times per gel section . data obtained by esi _METHOD_ were analyzed with mascot or sonar software and hits with a significant mascot or sonar score are listed in table ii . the number of peptides identified for each protein varied between and . for proteins with a single peptide hit the run was repeated with a different _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ sample but the same peptide was found in the second _METHOD_ analysis . we analyzed the predicted subcellular localization of the proteins listed in table i and ii by using a number of prediction _METHOD_ . based on this analysis and the functional annotation of the polypeptides the identified proteins were sorted into five groups proteins predicted to reside in the nucleoplasm the nucleolus the cytoplasm proteins of unclear localization and the proteins predicted to be located in other subcellular compartments . a protein was defined as _LOCATION_ if it contained a sequence experimentally verified as nls or scored positive for _LOCATION_ localization by psort and protcomp or had been annotated as the arabidopsis homologue of a _LOCATION_ protein . four _LOCATION_ proteins were identified . besides histone _PROTEIN_ presumably present as a remnant of the chromatin fraction three novel proteins with unknown or putative functions were identified . sixteen proteins were identified that were predicted to have a nucleolar function . the nucleolar proteins were consistently identified with highest confidence based on mascot mowse scores and numbers of peptides indicating their relative high abundance in the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ fraction . many of the identified nucleolar proteins are homologues of proteins associated with snornp complexes such as the snrnp protein _PROTEIN_ members of the group and a group of proteins homologous to and _PROTEIN_ . two members of the _PROTEIN_ family have previously been shown to be _PROTEIN_ proteins forming part of the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ in pea . fibrillarin functions as an essential protein required for rrna methylation cleavages and ribosome assembly . _PROTEIN_ and form a core complex with which is able to interact with small ribonucleolar rnas within the context of c/d box snornps . _PROTEIN_ is involved in ribosomal rna processing and was found in arabidopsis both in the nucleoli and the associated cajal bodies . in addition to these proteins a group of nucleolar proteins engaged in other functions has been identified . they include nucleolin a ubiquitous nucleolar protein . this finding _METHOD_ molecularly previous reports by immunocytochemistry of nucleolin in the plant nucleolar _PROTEIN_ . other putative nucleolar proteins included the ribosomal proteins and and a protein highly homologous to the maize nucleolar _PROTEIN_ histone deacetylase . in addition an unknown protein was detected which has a amino acid identity to the human nucleolar and phosphoprotein . functions in nucleologenesis and may play a role in the _PROTEIN_ of the dense fibrillar component in the nucleolus . the third general class of proteins is composed of those predicted to be cytoplasmic . it is possible that some proteins of this class represent cytoplasmic contaminants however their true subcellular location will have to be determined experimentally . the major proteins in this group were identified several times both by esi _METHOD_ and by maldi tof and found to have very high mascot mowse scores indicating that they are abundant proteins in the fraction . the most prominent proteins of this group were two putative synthases . sam synthase catalyses the conversion of _PROTEIN_ and into . sam functions as a methyl group donor for various transmethylation reactions and as a cofactor in metabolic reactions . in addition a number of and were identified . it can not be ruled out that the tubulin components as cytoplasmic inclusions especially since in animal apoptotic cells they have also been found to with _LOCATION_ fractions likely as a result of the tubulin network collapsing towards the _LOCATION_ surface . other proteins in this group were homologous to an protein and a homologue of the dnaj . the fourth class includes the proteins with unclear predicted localization . the proteins of this group included a homologue of translation elongation _PROTEIN_ and the heat shock protein which is predicted to be localized in the cytoplasm but also contains consensus sequences for _LOCATION_ targeting . among other proteins found in the arabidopsis _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ was an unknown protein which shares identity and similarity on the amino acid level with the mouse hypothetical protein . another identified protein was the putative protein with amino acid identity to a mouse protein containing a basic leucine zipper and domain _PROTEIN_ a interaction domain found in several translation elongation _PROTEIN_ . finally chloroplast translation elongation _PROTEIN_ an adenylate translocator and an adp _PROTEIN_ carrier protein were identified . they are predicted to be located in the chloroplast or mitochondria and therefore most likely represent contamination of the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ preparation with these organelles . figure shows the predicted subcellular localization and functional annotation of all identified proteins . proteins with unknown or unclear function were searched for domains which are found in filamentous _LOCATION_ proteins such as lamins or numa . we found four proteins containing motifs but only has a motif of sufficient length to predict a possible structural function .
