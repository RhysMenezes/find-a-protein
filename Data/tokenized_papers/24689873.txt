the cap binding proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have well established roles in rna metabolism and plant growth and development . although these proteins are thought to be involved in the plant s response to environmental stress their functions in this process are unclear . here we demonstrated that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ null mutants had abnormal leaves and flowers and exhibited increased sensitivity to salt stress . the aberrant phenotypes were more pronounced in the _PROTEIN_ double mutant . quantification by itraq identified differentially _PROTEIN_ proteins in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines compared with the wild type col under salt stress conditions . most of these differentially _PROTEIN_ proteins were synergistically _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have synergistic roles during the salt stress response . biochemical analysis demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ physically interacted with each other . further analysis revealed that _PROTEIN_ regulated the splicing of genes involved in proline and sugar metabolism and that the epigenetic and post translational modifications of these genes were involved in salt stress tolerance . our data suggest a link between _PROTEIN_ dependent protein ubiquitination/sumoylation and the salt stress response .
to establish the roles of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we first identified _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ t dna null mutants . as shown in figure citationa _PROTEIN_ contains exons and _PROTEIN_ contains . the exogenous t dna transporter inserted into the utr region of _PROTEIN_ inactivated transcription in the _PROTEIN_ mutant and the t dna inserted into the exon of _PROTEIN_ inactivated transcription in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . using primers designed to detect the t dna fragment the left region and the right region _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ we found that the and primer pairs successfully amplified bands in the wild type lines but failed to amplify fragments in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines due to the t dna insertion . the and primer pairs amplified a band in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ indicating that the t dna insertion is indeed present in the _PROTEIN_ region . quantitative rt pcr showed that the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines had very low levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts in comparison with the wild type col line . we also crossed the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines to generate the _PROTEIN_ double mutant . similarly t dna insertions were confirmed by pcr based genotyping and qrt pcr analysis . we examined the localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in transgenic plants harboring gus fusions of the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ promoters . analysis of gus _PROTEIN_ in gus and gus transgenic lines showed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were both constitutively _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was strong in the seeds leaves flowers and roots suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have ubiquitous roles in plant growth and development which correlates with previous study.citation to determine the localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins we fused _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to the _METHOD_ gene and _PROTEIN_ these constructs under the constitutively active cauliflower mosaic virus promoter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . then we transiently _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in tobacco leaves by agrobacterium mediated injection or in arabidopsis protoplasts . we observed strong _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ of tobacco leaves and arabidopsis protoplasts suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function in the _LOCATION_ . such location also coincide with the functions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ of regulating gene transcription and epigenetic regulation in the _LOCATION_ . given that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are involved in aba signal transduction and drought stress citation we wanted to investigate if they also function in salt stress . we thus examined their sensitivity to salt stress . when grown on vertical _METHOD_ plates without salt stress the root lengths of week old _PROTEIN_ seedlings were similar to those of the wild type whereas _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ root growth was more severely inhibited under salt stress . exposure to an increasing gradient of salt resulted in a gradual reduction in root length of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants . furthermore the _PROTEIN_ double mutant was more sensitive to high concentrations of salt than was either of the single mutants . similarly the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants were sensitive to salt stress when grown on soil irrigated with mm salt and the salt sensitive phenotype of _PROTEIN_ was more pronounced than that of either of the single mutants . in addition the _METHOD_ of week old _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants grown in the salt treated soil was lower than that of the wild type . to establish the underlying function of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the salt stress response we conducted an itraq proteome analysis of differential protein changes in wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants after days of treatment with mm nacl . total spectra were generated and the data collected were analyzed using mascot software . using this approach we identified unique peptides and proteins . over of the proteins identified included at least two peptides . we determined the ratios of protein abundance for the following four groups _PROTEIN_ /wild type _PROTEIN_ /wild type _PROTEIN_ /wild type and _PROTEIN_ /wild type for proteins affected by salt stress in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . with a threshold of fold change cutoff of > fold for increased _PROTEIN_ and < fold for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a total of proteins differed significantly in the comparisons of wt _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ without nacl treatment . some of these proteins were associated with auxin signaling such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ suggesting a mechanism whereby _PROTEIN_ mediates auxin distribution or leaf shape development . furthermore some proteins related to epigenetic modification or rna biogenesis including microrna biosynthesis such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were also shown to be differentially _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutants compared with the wild type in the absence of salt stress . these data support previous findings that _PROTEIN_ regulates microrna biosynthesis to modulate leaf development.citation proteins involved in ubiquitination or sumo modification such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were also differentially _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are involved in post transcriptional modification during plant growth and development . our itraq results showed that a total of proteins had significant differences in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutant compared with the wild type . among these proteins and were up regulated in _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ respectively under salt stress compared with the wild type and and proteins were down regulated in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively under saline stress compared with the wild type . on the basis of gene ontology analysis and blast alignments the proteins that exhibited significant changes under normal conditions and salt treatment were classified into eight functional categories namely energy and material metabolism defense response related ubiquitination and sumoylation modification epigenetic modification protein kinase and phosphatase cell division and structure hormone related and transcriptional _PROTEIN_ . in particular proteins involved in epigenetic modification such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ involved in ubiquitination and sumoylation modification such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and involved in defense responses such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were coincidentally up regulated or down regulated after salt stress in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants indicating that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ coordinately modulate protein _PROTEIN_ during the saline stress response . it is reported that _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ to participate in pre mrna alternative splicing to modulate gene _PROTEIN_ citation and thus it is possible that _PROTEIN_ functions coordinately with _PROTEIN_ to regulate differential protein accumulation by synergistically controlling the alternative splicing of genes under salt stress . to test this possibility we examined the transcriptional products of several genes that encode proteins showing significant differential _PROTEIN_ in our itraq analysis . for instance we examined the transcriptional products of _PROTEIN_ which encodes a calcium binding protein and is induced by salt aba and drought stress.citation the encoded protein was markedly down regulated in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type after exposure to salt stress . rt pcr analysis of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings using primers specific to _PROTEIN_ revealed a prominent band and a slower moving minor band . whereas the prominent band was also present in the wild type the minor band was barely detectable . further analysis using primers corresponding to the first and third exon confirmed that the larger band in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants resulted from the retention of the first and second introns . salt stress increased the accumulation of the smaller band in wild type seedlings but increased the abundance of the larger band in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the intensity of the larger band was greatest in the _PROTEIN_ double mutant suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ act synergistically to direct the correct splicing of this gene . this gene could be modulated by histone methylation and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cbc may modify the corresponding histones.citation furthermore _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ encode a putative rna binding protein and _PROTEIN_ type histone deacetylase hdac protein respectively . these two proteins were down regulated in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ after exposure to saline stress compared with the wild type . rt pcr of these two genes showed that a large minor band that was absent in the wild type appeared in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants before saline stress and that the intensity of this band increased after salt stress becoming visible in the wild type sample . it is possible that the aberrant pre mrna splicing of these two genes in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ caused the down regulation of the proteins encoded by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in line with this notion these two proteins are involved in the response to abiotic stresses such as aba.citation auxin response _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and auxin response _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are two important auxin responsible proteins involved in plant development and environmental stress responses . we found that these two proteins were down regulated in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants in the presence or absence of saline stress . in agreement with our itraq data rt pcr analysis of these two genes showed one larger band in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant that was absent in the wild type suggesting that incorrect splicing of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ resulted in the down regulation of the two encoded proteins which may underlie the abnormal serrations in the leaves of _PROTEIN_ an _PROTEIN_ . because _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are the targets of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ may be regulated by _PROTEIN_ citation one component of the machinery that generates microrna it is possible that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ affect the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ by regulating microrna biogenesis . the reactive oxygen species burst and increase in antioxidant enzyme activity were characterized in plants subjected to abiotic stress including saline stress.citation we found that the antioxidant enzyme gene _PROTEIN_ which encodes a glutathione s transferase family protein exhibited incorrect splicing in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants and that salt stress increased the abundance of the incorrectly spliced band . this finding supports our itraq data which showed that the _PROTEIN_ of both of these proteins was down regulated in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ before or after exposure to salt stress . these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mediate many _METHOD_ during plant in response to saline stress such as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mediating the gene splicing involved in the microrna biogenesis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and epigenetic regulators the calcium signal or the redox status . similarly the degree of aberrant splicing of _PROTEIN_ which encodes a basic leucine zipper transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was also increased in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ after exposure to salt stress and this effect was enhanced in the _PROTEIN_ double mutant suggesting the roles of _PROTEIN_ mediated splicing of transcriptional _PROTEIN_ during saline stress . the amino acid proline accumulates in response to multiple _METHOD_ of environmental stress such as high temperature and cold.citation salt stress also increases proline content in arabidopsis . _PROTEIN_ has a critical function in proline metabolism in plants . the alternative splicing of _PROTEIN_ in different ecotypes of arabidopsis resulted in differential responses to osmotic stress.citation here we identified at least two types of _PROTEIN_ pre mrna splicing variants in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . in addition the abundance of the aberrant splicing products increased after exposure to salt stress . this finding supported our itraq data which showed that the protein level of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants was at and times less than that in the wild type under saline stress . we used an anti _PROTEIN_ antibody to monitor _PROTEIN_ accumulation in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants after exposure to salt stress . _PROTEIN_ levels showed a marked increase in the wild type after exposure to salt stress however the increase was limited in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . consistent with this finding the proline content rapidly increased in the wild type after or days of salt stress reacted about and mg g fw . whereas a similar increase in proline content was observed in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines exposed to salt stress the increase was markedly less than that in the wild type only about half of wild type after saline stress . these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ mediates the correct splicing of _PROTEIN_ pre mrna which is important for the salt stress induced proline content increase and salt tolerance in arabidopsis . starch as a source of _PROTEIN_ is involved in the plant s response to environmental stress.citation the transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ binds to the promoter region of qua quine starch _PROTEIN_ which regulates starch degradation to modulate its _PROTEIN_ alternative gene splicing is involved in development and in stress responses.citation _PROTEIN_ has two different splicing variants the larger variant is termed _PROTEIN_ and the smaller variant which lacks the first exon encoding the dna binding motif is termed _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ form of protein can compete with _PROTEIN_ homodimers to generate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ heterodimers which reduce binding to the promoter of _PROTEIN_ and thereby reduce starch degradation.citation in cold stress the transcriptional increase in the _PROTEIN_ form reduced the ability of _PROTEIN_ to bind to the promoter region of _PROTEIN_ and thereby reduced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and prevented starch degradation.citation here we examined the alternative splicing of _PROTEIN_ pre mrna using primers corresponding to the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ form respectively . we found that one spectra corresponding to the first exon of _PROTEIN_ sustained high levels in the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutant after salt stress while the _PROTEIN_ level of this spectra was markedly reduced in the wild type indicating that _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ form was higher in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants than in the wild type . however we noticed that the _PROTEIN_ level of two other spectra corresponding to the second and third exons was increased in the wild type lines suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ form was more abundant in the wild type after salt stress . these itraq data suggest that differences in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were associated with the alternative splicing of _PROTEIN_ during salt stress . to test this notion we used rt pcr analysis to determine the abundance of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants under salt stress . the mrna variant encoding the _PROTEIN_ type showed a marked increase in _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants under salt stress compared with the wild type . in contrast the _PROTEIN_ type increased in the wild type under salt stress compared with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which correlated with our itraq data on the differential accumulation patterns of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and wild type lines under salt stress . we also prepared a protein antibody corresponding to full length _PROTEIN_ . as shown in figure citationc this antibody detected two separate bands representing the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and wild type lines in the absence of salt stress . the larger band corresponding to the _PROTEIN_ form did not show obvious changes in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant after days of salt stress but the abundance of the smaller band corresponding to the _PROTEIN_ form gradually increased in the wild type line but not in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ double mutant during salt stress treatment . consistent with the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ after salt stress we found that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ increased in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines and to a greater extent in the double mutant after salt stress compared with the wild type . the increase in the _PROTEIN_ form interfered with the binding of _PROTEIN_ to the promoter of _PROTEIN_ and thereby suppressed _PROTEIN_ transcription . it is possible that loss of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant caused the incorrectly spliced variant of _PROTEIN_ to reduce the generation of _PROTEIN_ after exposure to salt stress which caused an increase in the ratio of _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ thus activating the transcription of _PROTEIN_ and causing increased starch degradation in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in contrast the increase in _PROTEIN_ accumulation in the wild type resulted in efficient splicing of _PROTEIN_ and limited the binding of _PROTEIN_ to the promoter region of _PROTEIN_ subsequently reducing _PROTEIN_ transcription . as a result more starch accumulated in wild type lines under salt stress we found that the starch content in the wild type reached and mg g fw after or days of saline stress while such content in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was reduced by compared with wild type after saline stress . the iodine solution staining can be used to visualize the starch accumulation in the plant . in agreement with the previously described transcriptional results our staining results using lugol solution staining indicated more starch accumulation in the leaves of wild type after saline stress while less starch accumulation was observed in the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutants after saline stress . previous study demonstrates that salt stress induces starch accumulation which improves the plant s defense response.citation here we also found that salt stress increased starch content in wild type plants and that this was accompanied by an increase in _PROTEIN_ transcription and a reduction in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . it is possible that the sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to salt stress results from the incorrect splicing of _PROTEIN_ which reduces _PROTEIN_ accumulation . as a result _PROTEIN_ transcription is _PROTEIN_ at high levels which promotes starch degradation and possibly underlies the sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to salt stress . protein sumoylation modification is associated with rna level epigenetic regulation citation and the cbc affects chromatin _PROTEIN_ ubiquitination by facilitating pre mrna splicing and histone _PROTEIN_ ubiquitination citation and is involved in chromatin epigenetic modification.citation it is possible that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ affect protein post translation modification such as ubiquitination or sumoylation modification . our itraq data showed that most ubiquitination or sumoylation related proteins such as _PROTEIN_ which encodes ubiquitin conjugating enzyme variant and _PROTEIN_ which encodes a plant small ubiquitin like modifier ligase were markedly up and down regulated respectively in the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutant after salt stress compared with the wild type line . it is possible that loss of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants affects the degree of ubiquitination or sumoylation and thereby modulates the salt stress response . to test this possibility we examined the degree of ubiquitination and sumoylation in the wild type line after various periods of salt stress using specific antiubi and antisumo antibodies . as shown in figure citation salt stress induced a marked increase in protein ubiquitination and sumoylation in the wild type however the degree of ubiquitination and sumoylation in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants was reduced after salt stress and this reduction was likely related to the increased sensitivity of the mutants to salt stress . miller et al . reported that several _PROTEIN_ such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ regulate mrna splicing as dynamic targets of stress induced sumoylation in arabidopsis.citation for instance _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ to mediate gene splicing or epigenetic modification citation and the cbc facilitates _PROTEIN_ splicing by altering the _PROTEIN_ ubiquitination status.citation these lines of evidence indicate the association between _PROTEIN_ mediated gene splicing and protein sumoylation/ubiquitination status . it is possible that _PROTEIN_ modulates gene splicing under salt stress by altering the protein ubiquitination and sumoylation status of key target components involved in gene splicing or epigenetic processes .
