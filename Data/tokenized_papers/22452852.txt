abscisic acid is a stress related phytohormone that has roles in dehydration and rehydration . in arabidopsis two genes that inactivate abscisic acid _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are rapidly up regulated upon rehydration . the _PROTEIN_ that regulate _PROTEIN_ are not well characterized . we _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ as a green _METHOD_ protein fusion protein in arabidopsis and found that the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ was enhanced within min after rehydration . a yeast one hybrid assay revealed that the amino terminal region of _PROTEIN_ has transcriptional activation potential . in a transient reporter assay using arabidopsis protoplasts _PROTEIN_ enhanced the promoter activities of _PROTEIN_ . in gel shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses _PROTEIN_ directly bound to dna fragments of the _PROTEIN_ promoters . transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein were found to overexpress _PROTEIN_ mrnas . the time course of _LOCATION_ cytoplasmic shuttling of _PROTEIN_ was consistent with the time courses of the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ functions as a regulator of osmosensory signaling in arabidopsis .
during our investigation of the pathogen related role of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis we generated transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was confirmed by immunoblot analysis and two lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ that had different _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were chosen for further analysis . in the course of our _METHOD_ observations we noticed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals in the _LOCATION_ were rapidly enhanced after _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants were submerged in water . when the submergence was prolonged _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals in the _LOCATION_ of root cells became speckled and then weakened . this phenomenon was also observed in hypocotyls and leaf cells including epidermal mesophyll and guard cells . it took longer for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals in the _LOCATION_ to be attenuated in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ than in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the rapid signal intensification of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ was inhibited in the presence of m mannitol but not by the phytohormones aba and _PROTEIN_ . these results suggest that the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is rapidly increased upon an increase of turgor pressure and is slowly _PROTEIN_ after cells are acclimated to the change in turgor pressure . _PROTEIN_ has a functional _LOCATION_ localization signal at the beginning of its _PROTEIN_ domain and a putative _LOCATION_ export signal in its c terminal region . to examine whether active _LOCATION_ export is involved in regulating the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ we examined the effects of leptomycin b on _PROTEIN_ localization . in active _LOCATION_ export exportin binds to a cargo protein in the _LOCATION_ and transports it to the cytoplasm . the process can be inhibited by leptomycin b . in the presence of leptomycin b signals of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were retained in the _LOCATION_ even min after plants were submerged in water . in addition leptomycin b enhanced _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals in the _LOCATION_ even in the presence of m mannitol . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is actively exported from the _LOCATION_ when turgor pressure is steady and that the active _LOCATION_ export of _PROTEIN_ is inhibited when turgor pressure is increased . the transcriptional activation function of _PROTEIN_ was evaluated with a yeast one hybrid assay . full length or truncated _PROTEIN_ was fused to dna binding domain and the fusion protein was _PROTEIN_ in a yeast reporter strain that has binding sites upstream of the reporter genes and lacz . when the n terminal region of _PROTEIN_ was present transformed yeast cells were able to grow on medium lacking adenine and his and showed higher galactosidase activities suggesting that the n terminal region of _PROTEIN_ functions as a transcriptional activation domain in yeast . because the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ was rapidly enhanced by increased turgor pressure we examined the relationship between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which was reported to be up regulated upon rehydration or under high humidity conditions . first we used _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ as an effector and _PROTEIN_ promoter luciferase as a reporter to examine the effects of _PROTEIN_ on the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . reporter activities were enhanced only when _PROTEIN_ was present in the effector plasmid suggesting that _PROTEIN_ can activate the promoter activities of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . next we carried out gel shift assays using full length _PROTEIN_ or the c terminal _PROTEIN_ domain of _PROTEIN_ to examine whether _PROTEIN_ directly binds to the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ promoters in vitro . for the probes we first used approximately bp of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ promoters just upstream of the start codons . when the _PROTEIN_ approximately bp promoter was used as a probe shifted bands appeared when the _PROTEIN_ c terminus was present in the reaction solution and when full length _PROTEIN_ was present in the reaction solution . furthermore these signals were weakened in the presence of competitor dna . similar results were obtained when the _PROTEIN_ approximately bp promoter was used as a probe . an alignment of the approximately bp promoters shows several shared regions which could explain how _PROTEIN_ could bind to both promoters . a smaller fragment of the _PROTEIN_ promoter without the g box which is known to bind many _PROTEIN_ proteins was also shifted in the presence of _PROTEIN_ suggesting that this region contains a _PROTEIN_ binding sequence . next a chromatin immunoprecipitation _PROTEIN_ analysis was performed to examine whether _PROTEIN_ interacts with the _PROTEIN_ promoters in vivo . in the _PROTEIN_ analysis _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants were rehydrated and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was immunoprecipitated using an anti _METHOD_ antibody after _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was cross linked with dna . _PROTEIN_ promoter fragments were detected only when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was precipitated suggesting that _PROTEIN_ binds the _PROTEIN_ promoters in vivo . finally we performed reverse transcription pcr analyses using a _PROTEIN_ deficient mutant _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to evaluate the effects of _PROTEIN_ on the transcription of _PROTEIN_ in vivo . lack of _PROTEIN_ transcripts in _PROTEIN_ and overexpression of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were confirmed by semiquantitative rt pcr . in all the genotypes studied the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts was transiently increased by rehydration and then _PROTEIN_ in agreement with previous reports . the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ were comparable among the five genotypes in semi qrt pcr . _PROTEIN_ was analyzed as a previously reported _PROTEIN_ target gene but there was little difference in its _PROTEIN_ level among the transgenic lines studied . the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ were further analyzed by quantitative rt pcr . the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ under rehydration were comparable among all the genotypes studied . in contrast the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ was lowest in _PROTEIN_ at to min after rehydration during which the rehydration dependent induction of _PROTEIN_ was maximized in all the genotypes . in addition the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ was highest in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at to min after rehydration . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ positively regulates the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ under rehydration . the _PROTEIN_ levels of dehydration responsive genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ aba responsive genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and another rehydration responsive gene _PROTEIN_ under rehydration did not seem to correlate with the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ does not regulate the transcription of these genes under rehydration . we examined the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ in various tissues by qrt pcr . _PROTEIN_ mrna was undetectable in mature seeds but detectable in all the other tissues studied being highest in flower stalks and lowest in seedlings . to further characterize the stage and tissue specificity of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ we generated transgenic plants carrying the _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ gus and histochemically stained them for gus activity . during the vegetative stage gus activity was detected in vascular tissues in hypocotyls and roots and around leaf joints . in flower organs gus staining was observed in anthers and pistils according to the developmental stages of flowers . gus activity was also found in young embryos . to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ is involved in osmotic stress responses the growth of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was compared with the growth of wild type and _METHOD_ plants in the presence of or mm mannitol or mm nacl . even under control conditions the growth of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was significantly retarded . in the presence of mannitol the growth of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and was more highly retarded than in wild type and _METHOD_ plants suggesting that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants are more sensitive to mannitol stress . on the other hand no clear difference was observed in their nacl responses . under all the conditions the germination rates of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and were comparable to the germination rate of _METHOD_ suggesting that the growth retardation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and was due to _PROTEIN_ water absorption at the postgermination stage . in plant cells immediately after the plants were picked up from the medium _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals were visible in the cytoplasm but not in the _LOCATION_ . using soil grown plants phenotypic analysis under dehydration and rehydration was also conducted but there was no clear difference in wilting phenotypes during dehydration and recovery after rehydration among the five genotypes studied . to examine whether _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and/or altered aba responses are involved in the mannitol sensitive phenotype of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and aba responsive genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was compared . the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ reflect both the endogenous level of aba and the sensitivity to aba . none of these genes however showed _PROTEIN_ patterns specific to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ levels of dehydration responsive genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and another rehydration responsive gene _PROTEIN_ were also compared but their _PROTEIN_ patterns were not specific to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in our qrt pcr system _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as well as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were up regulated by aba treatment . these results suggest that aba is not involved in the mannitol sensitive phenotype of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ .
