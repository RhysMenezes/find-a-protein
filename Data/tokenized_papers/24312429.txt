the root of arabidopsis thaliana is used as a model system to unravel the molecular nature of cell elongation and its arrest . from a micro array performed on roots that were treated with aminocyclopropane _PROTEIN_ acid the precursor of ethylene a small auxin up rna like gene was found to be up regulated . as it appeared as the gene in the family it was named . root and leaf growth of overexpression lines ectopically _PROTEIN_ indicated the possible involvement of the gene in the division process . using promoter gus and _METHOD_ lines strong _PROTEIN_ was seen in endodermal and pericycle cells at the end of the elongation zone and during several stages of _PROTEIN_ root primordia development . acc and iaa/naa were able to induce a strong up regulation of the gene and changed the _PROTEIN_ towards cortical and even epidermal cells at the beginning of the elongation zone . confirmation of this up regulation of _PROTEIN_ was delivered using qpcr which also indicated that the _PROTEIN_ quickly returned to normal levels when the inducing iaa stimulus was removed a behaviour also seen in other saur genes . furthermore confocal analysis of protein _METHOD_ fusions localized the protein in the _LOCATION_ cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ was quantified in several mutants in ethylene and auxin related pathways which led to the conclusion that the _PROTEIN_ of is _PROTEIN_ regulated by the increase in auxin that results from the addition of acc rather than by acc itself .
to decipher the mechanism by which acc mediates the control of cell elongation a microarray was performed on control and acc treated roots . this transcriptome analysis identified differentially _PROTEIN_ genes _PROTEIN_ . besides genes with a presumptive role in the ethylene signalling pathway and cell wall metabolism also several auxin related genes were identified . since ethylene is documented to influence auxin transport and biosynthesis _PROTEIN_ as part of well documented ethylene/auxin crosstalk this was as expected . in the list of the most upregulated genes by acc one predicted auxin related gene was present . this gene encodes a one exon protein of amino acids that is according to the tair website predicted to belong to the saur like auxin responsive protein family based on the presence of an auxin responsive saur protein domain . a linear representation of the gene including the insertion position of the t dna in the knock out line . red utr orange exon _PROTEIN_ start codon taa stop codon . b phylogenetic tree of the arabidopsis saur family including saur like proteins . a protein blast was performed to find its closest relatives in arabidopsis and the genes and both members of the saur like auxin responsive protein family with similarities of and and identities of and respectively were found . furthermore tair identifies genes that code for proteins that belong to the small auxin up rnas or saur like family . a phylogenetic tree of the saur and saur like family was prepared and was marked . in contrast to the trees generated before this study our tree includes saur and saur like proteins which accounts for much more genes making direct comparison rather difficult . in addition presents all tair derived saur and saur like genes and also their already used names . further in silico analysis with genevestigator revealed that the _PROTEIN_ of is detected throughout plant development and in all organs . this low resolution analysis indicates that relatively high _PROTEIN_ is found during the early developmental seedling stages of the plant and lower _PROTEIN_ in the next stages until the young flower was found . in the developing flower the _PROTEIN_ first increases and then _PROTEIN_ until the siliques mature . confirmation of this in silico analysis was provided by the creation and analysis of kb promoter reporter lines . several independent lines were investigated yet only one representative line was used to generate the results shown . _PROTEIN_ in promoter gus lines is seen in the cotyledons hypocotyl and root of young seedlings . gus activity was also detected in flowers stamens and filaments in leaves and during several phases of _PROTEIN_ root formation . reporter _METHOD_ lines confirmed the results . a in silico _PROTEIN_ analysis of using genevestigator _PROTEIN_ as signal intensities on the array . _PROTEIN_ of seen as gus activity in promoter reporter lines in seedlings flowers stamens filaments leaves and during several phases of _PROTEIN_ root development . scale bar is in b and c in i l. since saur genes are known to respond rapidly and transiently to auxin seedlings/roots were treated during with iaa after which they were transferred back to control medium . individual root and leaf samples were taken in control plants plants treated with iaa and in plants after transfer from the iaa containing medium to a control medium . relative quantification of _PROTEIN_ with qpcr confirmed a strong auxin induced up regulation of but only in the roots . in leaves no significant up regulation was seen . in a control experiment to confirm that auxin was taken up into leaves auxin was clearly able to induce gus in leaves and roots . three hours after transfer to control medium however the _PROTEIN_ level of returned to control values in the roots . this auxin induced up regulation and return to control levels further supports the idea that indeed belongs to the saur family as this is one of the characteristic features . furthermore analysis of untreated roots and leaves demonstrated that is higher _PROTEIN_ in roots than in leaves . a transcript abundance in roots and leaves of control plants plants treated with acc during hours and of plants that were treated with acc and re transferred to control medium for hours . the transcript abundance is _PROTEIN_ relative to the level in control roots or shoots depending on the plant part studied transcript abundance in leaves and roots relative to the total _PROTEIN_ in roots and leaves together _PROTEIN_ . the asterisks points to a statistical significance towards the control _PROTEIN_ level or _PROTEIN_ in the leaves . a putative promoter sequence upstream of the start codon was used in an in silico analysis using plantcare and athena as resources together with genevestigator . this revealed several auxin ga and methyl jasmonate responsive cis elements in addition to potential regulation by aba and paclobutrazol _PROTEIN_ . the gus and _METHOD_ reporter lines were treated with these hormones to experimentally confirm these in silico data . as can be seen from both promoter driven gus and _METHOD_ lines reacted in a similar way to the different treatments . in control conditions the rather faint _PROTEIN_ of is seen in the central part of the root starting from the end of the elongation zone/start of the differentiation zone on . on a confocal mid plane longitudinal section and on a transverse section in the differentiation zone of untreated roots the cell types with _PROTEIN_ were identified as pericycle and endodermis . _PROTEIN_ was never seen in the outer cell layers . when roots were treated with acc during hours the _PROTEIN_ became clearly up regulated confirming the finding of the microarray analysis . furthermore _PROTEIN_ became evident already in cells that had just left the meristematic zone and it appeared in cell layers outside the endodermis . this up regulation was a bit faster and even more pronounced after iaa treatment and was confirmed in roots treated with naa . furthermore both in promoter gus and _METHOD_ reporter lines addition of aba and _PROTEIN_ resulted in a clear down regulation of _PROTEIN_ confirming the in silico promoter analysis . after prolonged exposure to iaa became _PROTEIN_ not only in endodermal cells but also in cortical cells and even in epidermal cells after hours . this up regulation was confirmed during the process of _PROTEIN_ root formation . when arabidopsis seedlings were treated during hours with acc or iaa higher _PROTEIN_ was seen in _PROTEIN_ root primordia than in control conditions . a _PROTEIN_ of seen in promoter gus and promoter _METHOD_ lines in control conditions . b _PROTEIN_ of in roots after h treatment with acc or c iaa . d confocal mid plane longitudinal and e transverse section in the differentiation zone of untreated promotor _METHOD_ roots and f after and hrs treatment with iaa . scale bars are in a c in d e and in f. it was shown before that ethylene/acc acts by regulating iaa transport/biosynthesis _PROTEIN_ . the small lag of the _PROTEIN_ spreading towards outer cell types and shifting to the start of the elongation zone seen after acc treatment in comparison with iaa addition is in accordance with this finding . in this case exogenous addition of iaa/naa bypasses this acc induction of iaa and as a consequence the response is faster when iaa is added directly . to reveal whether the acc induced up regulation of occurred directly by acc or by the acc induced increase in auxin different mutants in ethylene and auxin signalling were treated with acc and iaa and the _PROTEIN_ levels of were determined by qpcr . it is known that when ethylene binds to the _PROTEIN_ receptor _PROTEIN_ may allow interaction of _PROTEIN_ with the kinase domain of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is a negative regulator of ethylene by blocking the signalling downstream to _PROTEIN_ so the _PROTEIN_ mutant will have lost the blocking capacity resulting in a constitutive response to ethylene . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants are insensitive towards ethylene as they can not sense or transduce the signal respectively . under control conditions was on average times higher _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ than in the wt whereas no significant difference in _PROTEIN_ was seen between wild type and the ethylene insensitive _PROTEIN_ while _PROTEIN_ of was approximately less in _PROTEIN_ plants . this agrees with the observed up regulation of in acc treated wild type seedlings as the _PROTEIN_ plants mimic a wild type plant treated with acc . upon acc addition the increase in _PROTEIN_ of was much higher in the wt than in the treated _PROTEIN_ plants suggesting that efficient and working ethylene perception and signalling is required to increase the _PROTEIN_ of . as expected in the complete ethylene insensitive _PROTEIN_ background no acc effect on the _PROTEIN_ levels was seen while even a further reduction of the _PROTEIN_ was apparent in acc treated _PROTEIN_ plants . in the auxin import mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is higher than in the wt under control conditions . _PROTEIN_ shows only marginal increase in _PROTEIN_ after acc treatment indicating that _PROTEIN_ plays a prominent role in the observed increase of and that maybe the acc induced increase of auxin _PROTEIN_ is the key regulator of the observed increases in _PROTEIN_ . indeed iaa treatments induced a significant up regulation of in all ethylene related mutants and the wt providing further evidence that the increase of by acc is mostly occurring through the up regulation of auxin signalling . as a consequence it could be that different auxin levels are present in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant explaining the differences in _PROTEIN_ under control and in acc conditions . furthermore _PROTEIN_ shows an up regulation of _PROTEIN_ after iaa treatment . as auxin is not only transported into the cell by _PROTEIN_ transporters but also by diffusion through the _LOCATION_ the bulk addition of auxin in this case can lead to a higher auxin concentration in the cell even when _PROTEIN_ function is impaired and hence an up regulation of . furthermore the _PROTEIN_ that _PROTEIN_ levels in untreated _PROTEIN_ plants is higher than in the wild type and that it is under control of auxin suggests that the endogenous auxin levels might be disturbed in _PROTEIN_ . this in turn suggests that there is a feedback mechanism between one/several of the auxin signaling components and auxin biosynthesis itself . in addition the increase in _PROTEIN_ in overexpression plants treated with iaa or acc is higher than in the wt treated with iaa or acc providing further evidence that there must be some kind of feedback mechanism where the protein plays an active role . how exactly this feedback mechanism is regulated remains to be uncovered . nevertheless the outcome of this analysis is that the acc induced pathway leading to an increase in _PROTEIN_ of goes through changes in auxin concentration . a effect of hr iaa or b acc treatment on _PROTEIN_ levels in wild type ethylene and auxin mutants . points to a statistical significance towards the untreated wt and towards the treated wt _PROTEIN_ . from the putative saur or saur like genes 'subcellular location predictor indicates that of them are located either in the _LOCATION_ or in the _LOCATION_ based on local features of amino acids . however it was shown that saur proteins can be _LOCATION_ localised and/or _LOCATION_ which is not completely in accordance with the predicted location . the localisation of protein was therefore investigated in transgenic c and n terminal _METHOD_ protein fusion lines . shows the projected image of a z stack through the root with _METHOD_ suggested to be present in the cytoplasm _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and in the _LOCATION_ . to make sure that the observed _METHOD_ was indeed also present in the _LOCATION_ a double labelling experiment with a rapidly staining dye for dsdna was performed . in an overlap can be seen between the _METHOD_ signal and the red signal from confirming that _METHOD_ is indeed located inside the _LOCATION_ as well and not only around it and in the _LOCATION_ . furthermore western blot analysis using an antibody against _METHOD_ revealed that part of the _METHOD_ seen is indeed fused to the protein while another part is free _METHOD_ . in lane the proteins of a promoter _METHOD_ line were blotted to indicate the size of free _METHOD_ on the blot and the anti _METHOD_ antibody marks free _METHOD_ at around . lane represent the western blot on different independent _METHOD_ lines that were generated in this study and lane contains the molecular size marker . lane and show a clear band at the estimated size of the protein _METHOD_ fusion . from these different transgenic lines the plant whose proteins are within lane was used to generate the images in . however lines that show protein bound _METHOD_ also contain a faint band that is visible at suggesting that part of the _METHOD_ seen on is free and not protein bound . the _PROTEIN_ that is present in the _LOCATION_ suggests that it might act as a transcription _PROTEIN_ downstream of the acc/auxin signal which also _METHOD_ the hypothesis of weijers and friml . however given that part of the _METHOD_ seen on is free it is possible that the physiological relevant localisation of is the cytoplasm or the _LOCATION_ as was mentioned . a projected z stack image of c terminal _METHOD_ fused to the protein . cell walls were counterstained with propidium iodide . b co localisation of c terminal _METHOD_ fused to the protein and a red _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ stain . scale bars are and in a and b respectively . c western blot analysis using an anti _METHOD_ antibody on proteins from plants bearing free _METHOD_ and from several independent lines containing the c terminal protein _METHOD_ construct . lane contains the molecular marker . a knock out line in was identified and the exact insertion position of the t dna insertion was located at approximately of the exon using gene and t dna specific primers . several independent transgenic lines bearing a camv driven overexpression of the gene were generated . based on semi transcriptional and qpcr analysis the knock out was identified as being a null mutant and one overexpression line with the highest _PROTEIN_ level was selected for use in root phenotyping experiments . when wild type knock out and overexpression lines were grown on _METHOD_ plates the roots of the overexpression line were always approximately longer than wt and ko . a germination test revealed that a possible difference in germination rate was not responsible for this observed growth phenotype as all plants germinated at the same time . the difference in root length between the overexpression and wild type seedlings even increased from the day on . no significant difference was seen between root growth of wild type and knock out plants . the _PROTEIN_ that the overexpression of causes longer roots _METHOD_ contradictory to the finding that the gene becomes up regulated in the acc or iaa induced response leading to a shorter root phenotype . these data could lead to a possible conclusion that the gene plays a role in recovery or in controlling the levels of response to stresses caused by auxin or acc . how exactly it functions remains to be uncovered . moreover several treatments with different concentrations of hormones in day old seedlings did not show any clear phenotype between wt ko and overexpression plants when results were normalized to wt . statistical differences were only observed in the very _PROTEIN_ stages of the experiments . plants were grown on _METHOD_ medium and root growth was monitored relative to the length of the wild type . the asterisks points to a statistical significance towards the wt _PROTEIN_ . a more detailed analysis of the overexpression line revealed that the length of the epidermal cell with the first visible root hair bulge a measurement for mature cell length _PROTEIN_ was not altered . however an increased meristem cell number was found suggesting that the ectopic overexpression of influenced meristem size . as the gene was just moderately _PROTEIN_ in leaves the effect of the overexpression on leaf development was studied . leaf series of the wild type and two independent overexpression lines _PROTEIN_ indicate that the overexpression is negatively correlated with leaf area in a dose dependent manner . leaf was taken for further detailed studies which indicated that overexpression clearly affects leaf area by reducing the number of cells in the leaf and not the size of the cells . no statistical effect was seen on the differentiation as a similar number of stomata were counted . this again suggests that ectopic _PROTEIN_ influences meristematic activity as was seen in the root . as is induced by auxin this fits with auxin influencing the cell division process . a area of leaf series of the wild type and two independent overexpression lines . b leaf area of wt and overexpressor lines . c cell area d number of cells and e stomatatal index in leaf of wt and overexpressor lines . asterisks represent statistical differences towards the wild type and results are presented as means _PROTEIN_ .

methods were used depending on the nature of the experiments . in general for plant material that is easily accessible the _PROTEIN_ reagent was used according to the guidelines of the manufacturer .

_PROTEIN_ was used for the quality control of the isolated rna . the cdna synthesis was performed with superscript tm ii reverse transcriptase according to guidelines provided in the protocol . in addition to that the samples were treated with deoxyribonuclease i in order to avoid genomic dna . furthermore equal amount rna of the selected homozygous over _PROTEIN_ lines was used to create cdna which was then used to run a pcr with gene specific primers . a semi quantitative approach was used to compare the _PROTEIN_ in the selected line against the wt . in more detail equal amount of cdna from day old plants grown on solid _METHOD_ medium was used to run a pcr and micro liters were taken from the pcr solution during cycle and and analysed by gel electrophoresis . furthermore once the lines with a clear overexpression were identified qpcr analysis was performed to quantify the _PROTEIN_ level . for the qpcrs done in this work two methods were used . the analysis of the _PROTEIN_
