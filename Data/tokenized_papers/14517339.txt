glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored proteins are a functionally and structurally diverse family of post translationally modified _LOCATION_ proteins found mostly in the outer leaflet of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in a variety of eukaryotic cells . although the general role of gpi aps remains unclear they have attracted attention because they act as enzymes and receptors in cell adhesion differentiation and host pathogen interactions . gpi aps may represent potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets in humans and are interesting in plant biotechnology because of their key role in root development . we here present a general _METHOD_ _METHOD_ based proteomic shave and conquer strategy that specifically targets gpi aps . using a combination of biochemical methods _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and computational sequence analysis we identified six gpi aps in a homo sapiens lipid raft enriched fraction and gpi aps in an arabidopsis thaliana _LOCATION_ preparation representing the largest experimental dataset of gpi anchored proteins to date .
we have integrated protein fractionation methods _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and bioinformatics techniques into a proteomic shave and conquer strategy aimed at defining an extensive inventory of gpi aps in human and plant cells . the strategy is summarized in fig . . triton x detergent based two phase separation was used for partitioning _LOCATION_ proteins and soluble proteins in _LOCATION_ fractions from homo sapiens and a. thaliana . the isolated _LOCATION_ fractions were treated with phosphatidylinositol phospholipase c _PROTEIN_ enzyme in the presence of triton x by _PROTEIN_ the method of hooper et al . . this enzyme hydrolyzes the phosphatidylinositol releasing the soluble gpi protein from the _LOCATION_ phase and enabling its recovery in the aqueous phase . as the _PROTEIN_ plc enzyme used in the present study recognizes a specific gpi anchor structure probably only a subset of gpi aps is released from the _LOCATION_ preparations . some gpi anchors are modified by acylation at the and/or position of the inositol _PROTEIN_ prohibiting cleavage by _PROTEIN_ plc . the protein sample isolated in this way was concentrated by precipitation and separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . silver staining of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gels demonstrated that a range of proteins were selectively recovered upon _PROTEIN_ plc treatment of human raft enriched _LOCATION_ and plant _LOCATION_ preparations as compared with the untreated samples . furthermore western blotting using anti crd antibody specific for the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ plc treated gpi anchored protein demonstrated that gpi aps were highly enriched in the aqueous phase after _PROTEIN_ plc treatment of raft enriched _LOCATION_ and plant _LOCATION_ . in summary these data demonstrate that _LOCATION_ fractionation methods in combination with _PROTEIN_ plc treatment enable significant enrichment of a range of gpi anchored proteins from human and plant cells . next the recovered proteins were analyzed and identified by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . twelve consecutive protein bands were excised from the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gel containing the gpi ap enriched fraction from human raft enriched fractions as indicated in fig . . protein samples were in gel digested with trypsin and the recovered peptides were separated and sequenced by nanoscale hplc interfaced to electrospray ionization quadrupole time of flight tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . for each nanoscale liquid chromatography _METHOD_ run the complete set of peptide tandem _METHOD_ spectra was submitted for protein sequence database searching . a total of human proteins were identified comprising the initial set of putative gpi aps . to eliminate false positive and false negative assignments of gpi aps among this set of proteins we applied computational methods for amino acid sequence analysis and assignments of gpi aps . two gpi ap prediction tools big _PROTEIN_ and dgpi were used to screen the candidate human gpi aps . six known human gpi aps were correctly assigned by both methods except _PROTEIN_ m which was not predicted by big _PROTEIN_ . in addition the identified proteins that are not members of the gpi anchored protein family were also correctly assigned as such by these computational methods . this lack of false positive assignments is in accordance with a recent report that estimates the sensitivity of current gpi ap prediction tools to be with a false positive rate of only . thus the combination of sensitive selective and specific experimental and computational proteomic methods facilitates identification and assignment of gpi anchored _LOCATION_ proteins . this is further illustrated by the _PROTEIN_ that these six human gpi aps comprise the largest set of gpi aps recovered and identified in a single study of lipid raft enriched _LOCATION_ to date . the general utility of the integrated experimental and computational strategy for identification of gpi aps was investigated by using an a. thaliana cell _LOCATION_ preparation . _PROTEIN_ plc treatment and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ separation demonstrated significant enrichment of gpi anchored proteins . a total of protein bands were cut out processed and analyzed by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the liquid chromatography _METHOD_ data obtained from band is shown in fig . . the tandem _METHOD_ spectrum corresponding to the tryptic peptide _PROTEIN_ was the only detectable peptide originating from the _GENE_ protein in this experiment . nevertheless the high quality of the quadrupole time of flight tandem _METHOD_ spectrum enabled unambiguous identification of the cognate protein via protein sequence database searching . a total of seven proteins were identified in band . overall sequence database searching by peptide tandem _METHOD_ spectra led to the identification of a total of proteins in the protein bands obtained from the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gel . because of the lack of general and sensitive techniques for experimental verification of the putative gpi aps identified in this experiment we again applied bioinformatics methods to further characterize these proteins . in addition to big _PROTEIN_ and dgpi the list of putative a. thaliana gpi aps predicted by dupree and co workers was reviewed . of the identified proteins were predicted to be gpi aps by at least one of the computational techniques . sixteen of the identified proteins were assigned as gpi aps by two of the three computational methods whereas proteins were assigned as gpi aps by all three methods . two _PROTEIN_ were assigned as gpi aps by one computational method only _GENE_ as predicted by dgpi and _GENE_ as predicted by borner et al . . none of the three computational techniques assigned all of the gpi aps suggesting that further tuning is necessary and that the combination of several experimental and computational techniques is advantageous for this purpose . the contaminant proteins were all assigned as non gpi aps by all three computational methods . they either correspond to secreted proteins or were regular _LOCATION_ proteins . we manually inspected the positively assigned gpi anchored protein sequences and found that all of them had a cleavable signal peptide a hydrophobic c terminus of at least residues and no internal transmembrane domains as found by _LOCATION_ protein explorer . we could assign putative sites to most of the gpi aps which represented ser ala asn or gly residues and were residues upstream of the hydrophobic c terminus . in some cases up to two large residues were found near the site . these observations suggest an unusually large flexibility in the length of the spacer region as well as volume compensation in the active site that recognizes the site .
after serum starvation hela cells were lysed in mm ph and mechanically disrupted by strokes in a dounce homogenizer and three s bursts of a probe sonicator . the lysates were clarified and combined with an equal volume of sucrose in mes buffered saline for a final sucrose concentration of . this solution was then placed in the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube as the base of a discontinuous sucrose gradient . additional layers consisting of and sucrose in mbs were gently placed on top and the whole gradient was centrifuged at g for h at . the resulting low density light scattering band was extracted diluted in and centrifuged for a further h to pellet the raft enriched _LOCATION_ . suspension cultures of a. thaliana were _PROTEIN_ as described previously . _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were prepared as reported using a homogenization buffer containing mm sucrose mm hepes/koh ph mm egta glycerol polyvinylpyrrolidone k mm dithiothreitol and mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at ml/g of fresh weight . microsomal _LOCATION_ were resuspended in buffer r and subjected to phase partitioning in each dextran t and polyethylene glycol in buffer r. for removal of external soluble proteins _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were washed with mm . two phase separation was performed based on the work of bordier . _LOCATION_ were equilibrated by resuspending the pellet in buffer a and were pelleted again at g for min . the _LOCATION_ fraction was resuspended in of buffer a and then the same volume of triton x was added and mixed to homogeneity . the mixture was _PROTEIN_ on ice for min and then transferred to for min for phase separation . the aqueous supernatant was discarded and the procedure was repeated . the detergent phase was recovered and of buffer a with units of _PROTEIN_ plc was added the mixture was incubated at with shaking . after h phase separation was performed and the aqueous supernatant was recovered . buffer and enzyme were added again and the procedure was repeated . the two resulting supernatants were pooled and the proteins were recovered by acetone precipitation separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and visualized by silver staining . protein bands were cut out and in gel digested with trypsin . the gpi enriched fraction was separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride _LOCATION_ . immunoblotting against cross reacting determinant was performed as described previously . automated nanoflow liquid chromatography tandem _METHOD_ spectrometric analysis was performed using a quadrupole time of flight ultima _METHOD_ spectrometer _METHOD_ employing automated data dependent acquisition . a nanoflow hplc system _METHOD_ was used to deliver a flow rate of nl/min . chromatographic separation was accomplished by loading peptide samples onto a homemade cm fused silica precolumn using autosampler essentially as described by licklider et al . . sequential elution of peptides was accomplished using a linear gradient from solution a to of solution b in min over the precolumn in line with a homemade cm resolving column . the resolving column was connected using a fused silica transfer line to a distally coated fused silica emitter biased to kv . the _METHOD_ spectrometer was operated in the positive ion electrospray ionization mode with a resolution of full width half maximum using a source temperature of and a countercurrent nitrogen flow rate of liters/h . data dependent analysis was employed s _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and maximum s _METHOD_ with s dynamic exclusion . a charge state recognition algorithm was employed to determine optimal collision energy for low energy collision induced dissociation _METHOD_ of peptide ions . external _METHOD_ calibration using nai resulted in _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ of less than ppm typically ppm in the m/z range . raw data was processed using _METHOD_ proteinlynx and the resulting _METHOD_ dataset was exported in the _METHOD_ pkl format . automated peptide identification from raw data was performed using an in house mascot server _PROTEIN_ using the national center for biotechnology information non redundant protein database with the following constraints tryptic cleavage after arg and lys up to two missed cleavage sites and tolerance of for _METHOD_ and for _METHOD_ fragment ions . _PROTEIN_ was specified as a fixed modification and deamidation of asn and gln and oxidation of met were specified as partial modifications . most of the gpi aps were identified based on two or more different peptide tandem _METHOD_ spectra matching to each individual protein . a total of gpi aps were each identified based on one peptide sequence obtained by tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . in these cases the tandem _METHOD_ spectra were manually inspected to validate the data and the corresponding protein sequence assignments .
