recombination establishes the _PROTEIN_ that physically link pairs of homologous chromosomes in meiosis ensuring their balanced segregation at the first meiotic division and generating genetic variation . the visible manifestation of genetic crossing overs _PROTEIN_ are the result of an intricate and tightly regulated process involving induction of dna double strand breaks and their repair through invasion of a homologous template dna duplex catalysed by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in most eukaryotes . we describe here a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein that retains the ability to assemble at dna breaks but has lost its dna break repair capacity . this protein fully complements the meiotic chromosomal fragmentation and sterility of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants . even though _PROTEIN_ is the only active meiotic strand transfer protein in the absence of _PROTEIN_ catalytic activity no effect on genetic map distance was observed in complemented _PROTEIN_ plants . the presence of inactive _PROTEIN_ nucleofilaments is thus able to fully support meiotic dsb repair and normal levels of crossing over by _PROTEIN_ . our data demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ plays a supporting role for _PROTEIN_ in meiotic recombination in the flowering plant arabidopsis .
_PROTEIN_ plays a central role in homologous recombination in both mitotic and meiotic cells of eukaryotes including plants . to further investigate the roles of this protein during homologous recombination in planta we constructed a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ translational fusion . the _PROTEIN_ genomic coding sequence including introns but without the stop codon and bp of upstream sequence was amplified by pcr from dna of wild type arabidopsis and the _METHOD_ coding sequence fused to the end of the _PROTEIN_ open reading frame . the fusion construct was introduced into _PROTEIN_ heterozygote plants and transformants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ translational fusion protein were selected . pcr genotyping of the _PROTEIN_ locus of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transformants showed that were _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and were _PROTEIN_ . all five _PROTEIN_ plants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ translational fusion protein were fully fertile confirming that the fusion protein is able to complement the sterility phenotype of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ mutant . this complementation strictly cosegregated with the transgene in the following generation . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein is thus properly _PROTEIN_ and functional during meiosis in these plants . schematic representation of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion construct . wild type plants have long siliques full of seeds while _PROTEIN_ mutants are completely sterile . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ mutants restores fertility . the fertility of the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants complemented by the fusion protein clearly establishes that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is able to substitute for the _PROTEIN_ protein in its essential meiotic role . a detailed cytogenetic analysis of meiotic progression in pollen mother cells of plants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein confirmed this with meiotic stages appearing indistinguishable from wild type meiosis . in wild type plants meiotic chromosomes condense at leptotene . pairing and synapsis of homologues is seen as the synaptonemal complex at pachytene . chromosomes further condense and the expected five bivalents are observed at metaphase i . homologous chromosomes then segregate to opposite poles to give two sets of five chromosomes at metaphase ii . meiosis ii then proceeds and gives rise to haploid _LOCATION_ . in contrast pairing and synapsis are strongly impaired in _PROTEIN_ mutant . defects in dsb repair further lead to strong chromosome fragmentation fusion and chromosome mis segration producing unbalanced and fragmented polyads . in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants meiosis appears indistinguishable from wild type resulting in the expected haploid meiotic products . normal structure of the synaptonemal complex at pachytene of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ meiosis was confirmed by immunolocalisation of the synaptonemal complex axial element protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the sc transverse filament protein _PROTEIN_ . dapi staining of pollen mother cells during meiosis . leptotene pachytene metaphase i metaphase ii and tetrad showing four meiotic products and the equivalent stage with heterogeneous dna _METHOD_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . . immunolocalisation in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ pmc shows that synaptonemal complex proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are correctly loaded along chromosome axes at pachytene indicating normal completion of synapsis . dapi _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and merged images are shown . . as seen above the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein is properly _PROTEIN_ and functional during meiosis . in somatic tissues the expected strong _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is visible in _LOCATION_ of meristematic cells in primary and _PROTEIN_ roots and none detected in non dividing root transition and elongation zones . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein is present in the _LOCATION_ of primary root meristem and _PROTEIN_ root meristem cells . no or faint signals are observed in transition and elongation zone . differential interference contrast _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ images are shown . . to confirm the function of the fusion protein in mitotic cells we tested its capacity to complement the sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ mutant plants to the dna cross linking agent mitomycin c . wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants carrying or not the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein were grown on solid media containing increasing concentrations of mitomycin c and growth was scored after weeks . as expected under these conditions _PROTEIN_ mutants are highly sensitive while wild type plants show little sensitivity to mmc . unexpectedly given the complementation in meiosis and the _PROTEIN_ patterns in somatic cells the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein does not complement the mmc hypersensitivity of _PROTEIN_ plants . it acts as a dominant negative with both wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein clearly hypersensitive to mmc . this dominant negative phenotype implies that the fusion protein interferes with the proper functioning of the native _PROTEIN_ protein . sensitivity of plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to dna damaging agent mitomycin c . two week old seedlings grown without or with mmc are shown . _PROTEIN_ mutants are sterile and hence seeds of _PROTEIN_ heterozygotes were used and only of their progeny are homozygous and sensitive to mmc . genotypes of the plants were confirmed by pcr and _METHOD_ visualisation . sensitivity of the seedlings was scored after weeks and the fractions of resistant plants are shown . black fill wild type diagonal fill homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutants horizontal fill wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein no fill homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene . somatic homologous recombination is impaired in plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein . mean numbers of spontaneous gus recombinant spots in wild type plants and _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ or not the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein . standard _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and numbers of plants analysed are indicated for each genotype . the wild type plants with and without _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are sister plants from a population segregating the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ allele . the importance of homologous recombination in the repair of dna cross links has led to the use of mmc hypersensitivity as an indirect test for recombination capacity in a number of _METHOD_ . given the dominant negative mmc hypersensitivity conferred by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ we also directly tested somatic homologous recombination in these plants using the previously described iu.gus in planta recombination tester locus consisting of an interrupted _PROTEIN_ gene and a template gus sequence for repair . the iu.gus recombination reporter locus was crossed into _PROTEIN_ mutant plants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein and somatic hr frequencies monitored in progeny homozygous for iu.gus . shows quantification of spontaneous somatic recombination in wt and _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ or not the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein . as expected hr is severely reduced in _PROTEIN_ mutants compared to wild type plants which have a mean of recombination events per plant _PROTEIN_ . the presence of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in both wt and _PROTEIN_ plants resulted in levels of homologous recombination similar to those observed in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein is thus not functional in mitotic recombination and these results very clearly confirm the dominant negative effect with the presence of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein reducing recombination of _PROTEIN_ plants to the level of _PROTEIN_ plants . despite its ability to restore the fertility of _PROTEIN_ mutant plants the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein is clearly defective for somatic homologous recombination . presence of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein creates a separation of function phenotype . the phenotypes conferred by the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion appear very similar to those recently described in yeast for the mutant _PROTEIN_ protein which retains its ability to form nucleofilaments but has no joint molecule activity . using immunocytology to detect _PROTEIN_ nucleofilaments as brightly staining _LOCATION_ foci we tested whether the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein retains its ability to assemble at sites of dna breaks induced by gamma irradiation in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants . we have recently shown that gamma ray induced _PROTEIN_ foci are easily visualised in arabidopsis using a dose of gy . as expected no foci and only diffuse anti _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ staining were observed in root tip _LOCATION_ of unirradiated control plantlets . numerous foci were detected in _LOCATION_ from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ root tips fixed one or two hours after gy of gamma rays confirming that the ability of _PROTEIN_ to assemble at sites of dna damage is retained in somatic cells . the radio inducibility of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was confirmed by western blotting analyses after irradiation . immunolocalisation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants fixed just before and or hours after gy gamma irradiation . irradiation induced _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ foci are clearly visible in _LOCATION_ of the irradiated plants . dna is stained with dapi and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ foci _PROTEIN_ are coloured in red . images are collapsed z stack projections of a deconvoluted image stack . . immunolocalisation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in pollen mother cells of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mutants using an antibody against _PROTEIN_ . dna is stained with dapi and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ foci are red . synaptonemal complex protein _PROTEIN_ was used as a meiotic stage marker . images are collapsed z stack projections of a deconvoluted image stack . . the ability of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion to assemble at dna breaks in meiotic cells was confirmed by immunolocalisation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in pollen mother cell _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants which show the expected numerous meiotic _PROTEIN_ foci . immunostaining of _PROTEIN_ protein in these _LOCATION_ revealed the expected presence of abundant _PROTEIN_ foci in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein is thus present and _METHOD_ nucleofilaments in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants . meiosis is normal and the severe prophase i chromosome fragmentation of _PROTEIN_ mutants is fully complemented by the fusion protein . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is properly _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ the expected radio induced foci in mitotic cells but is catalytically non functional in mitotic hr . the most straightforward explanation for these results is that _PROTEIN_ protein carries out meiotic dsb repair in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants and that it requires the presence of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein . should this be so in the absence of _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein should no longer be able to complement the _PROTEIN_ meiotic phenotype . we thus crossed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants and identified the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants in the with and without _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . observation of meiosis in pollen mother cells of these plants showed the expected ten intact univalents in _PROTEIN_ and fragmented chromosomes in _PROTEIN_ metaphase i . meiosis progresses normally in _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with bivalents visible at metaphase i . extensive chromosome fragmentation and fusion were observed in of the meiocytes of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants clearly confirming that the meiotic dsb repair observed in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mutants is _PROTEIN_ dependent . in accord with the dominant negative mitotic phenotype chromosome fragmentation was also observed in all meiocytes of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein . the dominance was however incomplete with fragmentation observed in only of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ meiocytes _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein . meiotic spreads of pmcs showing ten intact univalents in _PROTEIN_ mutants strong chromosome fragmentation in _PROTEIN_ mutants and five normal bivalents in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mutants . in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ mutants all meiotic _LOCATION_ show strong chromosome fragmentation . . the proportions of meiocytes with fragmented chromosomes for each genotype are shown . is metaphase ii and are metaphase i/anaphase i . these data confirm that the complementation of the meiotic chromosome fragmentation and sterility of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ mutant plants by the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein is fully dependent upon the presence of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is thus able to repair all meiotic dsb in arabidopsis and depends upon the presence not the strand exchange activity of _PROTEIN_ to do so . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ recombinases play essential roles in the repair of induced meiotic dsb . the strikingly different phenotypes of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants however provide a clear illustration of their differing roles the intact univalents in _PROTEIN_ meiosis and chromosome fragmentation in _PROTEIN_ meiosis showing that although _PROTEIN_ is able to repair all dsbs in the absence of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ can not do so in the absence of _PROTEIN_ . the absence of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mutants furthermore confirming that interhomologue crossing over is a _PROTEIN_ dependent process . as shown above meiotic dsb repair is carried out by the activity of _PROTEIN_ alone in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants . we thus checked whether this results in elevated levels of meiotic interhomologue crossing over in these plants . wt plants and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants of the columbia ecotype were crossed to a wild type plant of the landsberg _LOCATION_ ecotype to yield _PROTEIN_ plants heterozygotes for the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene and wild type _PROTEIN_ col/ler hybrids in the . meiotic recombination was evaluated by analysing the segregation of markers in populations originating from at least two hybrid parents of each genotype . we measured crossing over rates in two genetic intervals defined by insertion/deletion _PROTEIN_ dna sequence markers on chromosomes and . as seen in no effect was observed on meiotic crossing over rates in the _PROTEIN_ separation of function mutant for either of the two genetic intervals . this was confirmed through counting _PROTEIN_ in metaphase i of wild type and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ male meiocytes which show means of and _PROTEIN_ per meiosis respectively . these results concord with those reported for the _PROTEIN_ yeast mutant and strongly suggest as in yeast that _PROTEIN_ is the catalytically active strand exchange protein in arabidopsis meiosis and that _PROTEIN_ plays a supporting role .
the arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants used in this work have been previously described . plants were grown under standard conditions seeds were stratified in water at for days and grown on soil or in vitro on agar plates sucrose and murashige and skoog salts . plants were then cultivated in a greenhouse or growth chamber with a hour light/dark cycle temperature and to relative humidity . for translational _METHOD_ fusions the genomic region without stop codon and a bp upstream sequence of _PROTEIN_ was amplified _PROTEIN_ inserted into and verified by sequencing . the complete fragment was then cloned into the _PROTEIN_ destination vector in which the promoter was removed with a saci/spei digest . the plasmid was inserted in an agrobacterium tumefaciens strain and used to transform wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants by the floral dip method . for the mitomycin c sensitivity assay seeds were surface sterilised and sown onto solid medium containing murashige and skoog salts sucrose agar and or mitomycin c . after stratification for days at plants were grown for two weeks and sensitivity analysed as previously described . plants with more than three true leaves were considered as resistant . the iu.gus in planta recombination tester locus consisting of an interrupted _PROTEIN_ gene and an internal repair template gus sequence was used to determine the rate of spontaneous somatic homologous recombination . seeds were surface sterilised stratified at for days and grown in petri dishes on w/v agar w/v sucrose and murashige and skoog salts for weeks . seedlings were then harvested and incubated in staining buffer containing mm sodium phosphate buffer v/v triton and mm x _PROTEIN_ dissolved in n n dimethylformamide . plants were then infiltrated under vacuum for min and incubated hours at . staining solution was replaced with ethanol to remove chlorophyll and blue spots counted under a dissecting microscope . wild type and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mutant plants were crossed with wild type landsberg _LOCATION_ ecotype plants . _PROTEIN_ heterozygotes carrying the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ wild type col/ler hybrids were selected . meiotic recombination rates were monitored in the segregating populations by _PROTEIN_ marker genotyping . for genotyping seeds from the populations were surface sterilised and grown in vitro on _METHOD_ sucrose agar for two weeks . individual seedlings were harvested dna extracted using nacl method and samples genotyped by pcr followed by analysis on agarose gels . meiotic chromosome spreads were prepared according to ross with the modifications introduced by fransz . whole inflorescences were fixed in ice cold ethanol/glacial acetic acid for min and stored at until further use . immature flower buds were rinsed twice at room temperature in distilled water for min followed by two washes in citrate buffer for min . buds of appropriate size were selected under a binocular microscope and incubated for h on a slide in of enzyme mixture w/v pectolyase and cytohelicase in a moist chamber at . each bud was then softened for minute in acetic acid on a microscope slide at fixed with ice cold ethanol/glacial acetic acid and air dried . finally slides were mounted in vectashield mounting medium with dapi . five day old seedlings were irradiated with a dose of gy from a source according to charbonnel et al . . preparation and immunostaining of _LOCATION_ were performed as previously described except that slides were incubated with primary antibody for hours at . the _PROTEIN_ antibody used in this study has been previously described and was raised in rabbit . immunolocalisation of proteins in pollen mother cells was performed as described previously _METHOD_ with the modifications introduced by kurzbauer et al . the anti _PROTEIN_ raised in guinea pig _METHOD_ was used at a dilution of . the anti _PROTEIN_ raised in rat was used at a dilution of . the anti _PROTEIN_ raised in rabbit was used at a dilution of and the anti _PROTEIN_ raised in rabbit was used at a dilution of . all observations were made with a motorised zeiss _METHOD_ microscope _PROTEIN_ using a pl apochromat oil objective . photographs were taken with an axiocam mrm camera _PROTEIN_ and appropriate zeiss filter sets _PROTEIN_ for the fluorochromes used filter set filter set and filter set . image stacks were captured in three dimensions and further deconvoluted with the deconvolution module of axiovision software _PROTEIN_ . for presentation the pictures are collapsed z stack projections obtained using the extended focus module of the axiovision software .
