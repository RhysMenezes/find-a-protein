galactans are abundant polysaccharides in plant cell walls which are generally found as side chains of rhamnogalacturonan i. rhamnogalacturonan i is a major component of pectin with a backbone of alternating rhamnose and galacturonic acid residues and side chains that include arabinans galactans and arabinogalactans . many enzymes are required to synthesize pectin but few have been identified . pectin is most abundant in primary walls of expanding cells but galactan is relatively abundant in secondary walls especially in tension wood that _METHOD_ in response to mechanical stress . we investigated enzymes in glycosyltransferase family _PROTEIN_ which has three members in arabidopsis thaliana which we designated galactan _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . loss of function mutants in the corresponding genes had a _PROTEIN_ galactan content and overexpression of _PROTEIN_ resulted in plants with higher galactan content . the plants did not have an obvious growth phenotype . heterologously _PROTEIN_ and affinity purified _PROTEIN_ could transfer gal residues from udp gal onto galactopentaose . _PROTEIN_ specifically formed galactosyl linkages and could add successive galactosyl residues to the acceptor . these observations confirm the identity of the _PROTEIN_ enzyme as galactan synthase . the identification of this enzyme could provide an important tool for engineering plants with improved bioenergy properties .
to identify candidate enzymes for galactan synthase we explored the cazy _PROTEIN_ database . glycosyltransferases in cazy are divided into families of which have angiosperm members . the galactan synthases were expected to be found in a family of enzymes that invert the configuration of the anomeric _PROTEIN_ during catalysis which limits the number of candidate families . many glycosyltransferases from various families have already been investigated by analyzing loss of function mutants however in most cases no clear indication of the role of the specific glycosyltransferases could be shown and previous studies have not led to the identification of candidates for a galactan synthase . recently a new family of glycosyltransferases _PROTEIN_ was added to cazy with the identification of novel galactosyltransferases in animals . the _PROTEIN_ proteins are reported from pigeon where they catalyze the transfer of linked gal onto linked gal in n glycan structures . however genes encoding _PROTEIN_ proteins are not found in all birds or in mammals . a _PROTEIN_ protein in caenorhabditis elegans has been shown to be a galactosyltransferase that adds gal onto a core fuc in n linked glycans . all plants that have had their genomes sequenced have members of _PROTEIN_ but these are likely to have a different role than in animals since gal is not known from plant n glycans . furthermore increased _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ genes has been observed in transcriptomic studies of tension wood which is known to be rich in galactan . we therefore decided to investigate the function of _PROTEIN_ proteins in arabidopsis which has three members of _PROTEIN_ . a phylogenetic tree is shown in supplemental figure online . the three arabidopsis proteins fall in two clades but only one of the clades is represented in rice and in the lycophyte selaginella moellendorffii a single gene encodes a protein which is about equally similar to proteins in either clade . a second _PROTEIN_ protein encoded in s. moellendorffii may be more closely related to the animal galactosyltransferases . two independent mutant lines with t dna insertions were identified for each of the three genes and homozygous mutants were identified by pcr . rt pcr analysis showed that no transcript could be detected in five of the mutants while one mutant with the t dna located in the promoter region _PROTEIN_ showed leaky _PROTEIN_ . based on the results shown below the genes were designated galactan _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . none of the mutants showed any obvious growth or developmental alterations compared with wild type plants . cell walls were prepared from rosette leaves and analyzed for monosaccharide composition . all six mutant lines showed a highly significant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of to in total cell wall gal content whereas the ratio between other sugars was not significantly changed . analysis of sugar composition in _METHOD_ showed a significant to reduction in gal in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ whereas no significant differences were found in _PROTEIN_ or in the other monosaccharides in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . analysis of sugar composition in seeds showed a small but significant reduction in gal in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant lines but not in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . for the subsequent studies we focused on _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ mutant which had the largest reduction in gal in leaf cell walls . the polysaccharide affected by the mutation was determined in immunodot assays using a monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes pectic galactan . indeed when assessing its epitope recognition the antibody showed less binding in the mutants than the wild type . by contrast a monoclonal antibody against arabinogalactan proteins did not show any difference in binding . the reduction in pectic galactan was further investigated by immunomicroscopy of transverse sections of petioles a tissue chosen because it is conducive to sectioning and immunomicroscopy and because _PROTEIN_ is highly _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ microscopy is not quantitative but the detection of the galactan epitope was strongly _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ when compared with the wild type . these data provide evidence that _PROTEIN_ is specifically involved in the biosynthesis of galactan . to analyze the spatial and developmental _PROTEIN_ of the gals genes we isolated rna from different tissues and determined the transcript levels of the gals genes by quantitative rt pcr . in addition we _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ gene under the control of the native promoters of the three genes . taken together our qrt pcr and promoter gus data are substantially consistent with publicly available microarray data . the results show that while the gals genes appeared to be almost ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis the absolute _PROTEIN_ values vary and distinct differences in the _PROTEIN_ patterns can be found . in general _PROTEIN_ showed an almost fold higher _PROTEIN_ than _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were highly _PROTEIN_ in the top of the stem whereas _PROTEIN_ showed the highest _PROTEIN_ in flowers and siliques . gus activity was observed in leaves _METHOD_ roots and dry seeds for all three gals genes . while _PROTEIN_ gus and _PROTEIN_ gus plants had gus signals in all leaf veins _PROTEIN_ gus plants only showed staining in the midrib . gus activity in trichomes was specifically found in _PROTEIN_ gus transgenic plants . all gals genes showed gus activity in roots in _PROTEIN_ gus and _PROTEIN_ gus plants staining occurred in the root vasculature while it was restricted to the root tip in gus plants . immature _PROTEIN_ gus and _PROTEIN_ gus plants had gus staining in primary leaves and roots . by contrast _PROTEIN_ gus seedlings had strong gus activity in the hypocotyl . _PROTEIN_ gus and _PROTEIN_ gus but not gus revealed gus _PROTEIN_ in floral tissues and siliques . the gals proteins are all predicted to be type ii _LOCATION_ proteins with a possible targeting to the secretory pathway . the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ was investigated by heterologous _PROTEIN_ of a yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion in nicotiana benthamiana and confocal laser scanning microscopy . this analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ was targeted to _LOCATION_ vesicles consistent with a role in pectin biosynthesis and the reported location of galactan synthase activity . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have previously been identified as putative _LOCATION_ proteins in a proteomic study of purified _LOCATION_ vesicles from arabidopsis cell cultures . because the animal _PROTEIN_ enzymes include galactosyltransferases and the arabidopsis mutants had a specific deficiency in galactan we concluded that the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ enzymes were strong candidates for galactan synthase . to characterize the biochemical function of _PROTEIN_ the protein was heterologously _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana as a fusion protein with n terminal _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ tags . galactosyltransferase assays using microsomal proteins and endogenous acceptors showed a high incorporation of gal from udp gal into polymeric products . the identity of a large proportion of the total product as galactan was confirmed by digestion with galactanase from aspergillus niger which released of the polymeric product as gal and a compound migrating as galactobiose on thin layer chromatography . about of the product remained soluble after treatment with koh followed by neutralization with ammonium formate and of the soluble material was retained on a q sepharose column as expected for galactan bound to a pectic backbone . to further characterize the galactosyltransferase activity we chemically synthesized galactopentaose by stepwise coupling of monomeric building blocks followed by global deprotection . after solubilization of microsomal _LOCATION_ with triton x and incubation in the presence of the acceptor and udp gal the unincorporated udp gal was removed by anion exchange chromatography and the product analyzed by liquid scintillation counting . the results showed a substantial activity of transfer of gal onto the acceptor with microsomes from plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tagged _PROTEIN_ . the galactan synthase activity was very stable as seen from the essentially linear time course . the activity obtained with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ corresponds to more than nmol gal mg with mm udp gal . this specific activity is substantially higher than what has been reported for other cell wall related glycosyltransferases after heterologous _PROTEIN_ even though those proteins were generally more pure . while the data using microsomal protein strongly indicated that _PROTEIN_ is indeed galactan synthase microsomes contain many proteins including endogenous galactan synthase . we therefore isolated the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein by affinity purification . we were not able to quantify the amount of purified protein and therefore could not calculate specific activity or turnover number for the isolated protein . the isolated protein retained acceptor dependent activity whereas the control reactions _PROTEIN_ had no detectable activity . to investigate if _PROTEIN_ could add more than one gal to the acceptor molecule we analyzed the products at high udp gal/acceptor ratio by scintillation counting and tlc . standards for galactooligosaccharides larger than the galactopentaose acceptor were not available but the tlc demonstrates a ladder of products with longer incubation times and higher udp gal/acceptor ratios leading to increasingly larger products . given that other oligosaccharides including galactopentaose migrate as a single band on the tlc it _METHOD_ reasonable to assume that the discrete radiolabeled bands correspond to galactohexaose galactoheptaose galactooctaose and galactononaose . a calculation of the ratio of incorporated gal per acceptor molecule confirmed that incorporation of more than one gal was taking place . interestingly the tlc suggests that the average product size was larger than calculated . for example with h incubation and acceptor the calculated incorporation was gal added per acceptor molecule therefore the predicted average product size would be galactosyl residues if incorporation was random . however the tlc suggested an average product size close to eight galactosyl residues . this may be due to a combination of the newly synthesized product being closer to the enzyme than the bulk acceptor molecules and to a higher acceptor efficiency of the longer oligosaccharide products than the acceptor . we do not think the data suggest any real processivity of the enzyme . the endo galactanase digestion established that gal was added to the endogenous acceptor with linkages . the product with exogenous acceptor was likewise investigated with endo galactanase as well as with a specific exo galactosidase from streptococcus pneumonia . the specificity of the exogalactosidase was confirmed in reactions with galactobiose galactobiose methyl galactobiose and galactobiose . when the radiolabeled product was treated with endo galactanase it was fully digested to gal and galactobiose and when it was treated with exo galactosidase it was fully digested to gal . to investigate the function of _PROTEIN_ as galactan synthase in vivo we _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis under control of the promoter . several independent lines with high _PROTEIN_ level of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein were selected based on _METHOD_ microscopy and immunoblotting of leaf extracts . cell walls from leaves of seven independent lines were then analyzed and six had increased gal content compared with the wild type . two lines were selected for further analysis in which showed that the content of cell wall gal was significantly increased _PROTEIN_ by . the increase in galactan was accompanied by a relative _PROTEIN_ in the other monosaccharides but there was no change in the relative amounts of the other monosaccharides between the wild type and overexpressors _PROTEIN_ . immunodot blots with the antibody confirmed that the gal increase was related to an increased accumulation of galactan . solubilization of the cell walls with koh and subsequent digestion with endo galactanase released of total gal in the wild type and in the overexpressors . no difference in monosaccharide composition between the wild type and overexpressors could be seen in the remaining pellet .
