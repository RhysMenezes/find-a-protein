glutathionylation of compounds is an important reaction in the detoxification of electrophilic xenobiotics and in the biosynthesis of endogenous molecules . the glutathione conjugates are further processed by peptidic cleavage reactions . in animals and plants glutamyl transpeptidases initiate the turnover by removal of the glutamate residue from the conjugate . plants have a second route leading to the formation of glutamylcysteinyl _PROTEIN_ conjugates . phytochelatin synthase is well known to mediate the synthesis of heavy metal binding phytochelatins . in addition the enzyme is also able to catabolize gs conjugates to the _PROTEIN_ derivative . in this study we addressed the cellular compartmentalization of pcs and its role in the plant specific _PROTEIN_ conjugate pathway in arabidopsis . localization studies of both arabidopsis pcs revealed a ubiquitous presence of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis seedlings while _PROTEIN_ was only detected in the root tip . a functional _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was localized to the _LOCATION_ compartment . inhibition of the _LOCATION_ import of gs bimane conjugate via azide treatment resulted in both a strong accumulation of _PROTEIN_ bimane and a _METHOD_ increase of the cellular cysteine to gs bimane ratio which was not observed in pcs deficient lines . these findings support a _LOCATION_ action of pcs . analysis of a triple mutant deficient in both arabidopsis pcs and _LOCATION_ glutamyl transpeptidase _PROTEIN_ is consistent with earlier observations of an efficient sequestration of gs conjugates into the _LOCATION_ and the requirement of _PROTEIN_ for their turnover . hence pcs contributes specifically to the _LOCATION_ turnover of gs conjugates and _PROTEIN_ plays the prominent role . we discuss a potential function of pcs in the _LOCATION_ turnover of gs conjugates .
gs conjugates are transported to the _LOCATION_ where they are degraded . the catabolism of gs conjugates may also occur in the cytoplasm . as pcs is known to catabolize gs conjugates to the _PROTEIN_ derivative it is a prime candidate for mediating an alternative metabolic pathway for gs conjugates in the _LOCATION_ . mcb is a model xenobiotic that has successfully been used to track the catabolism of gs bimane conjugates in planta . mcb is typically conjugated to gsh in the _LOCATION_ and subsequently sequestered in the _LOCATION_ . in order to evaluate the consequence of inhibiting the _LOCATION_ sequestration of mcb we treated cells with azide a potent inhibitor of f _PROTEIN_ and of abc transporters . confocal images of mcb _PROTEIN_ cell suspension cultures of arabidopsis show that the rapid accumulation of the _METHOD_ signal in the _LOCATION_ was prevented in the presence of azide as has been reported in earlier studies . we used feeding experiments with mcb in the presence of azide to assess whether blocking the uptake of bimane conjugates into _LOCATION_ results in a conversion of the gs conjugate in the cytoplasm . to analyze the effect of azide on gs bimane turnover the optimal azide concentration was established . in the concentration range tested from to mm azide an enhanced turnover of gs bimane to _PROTEIN_ bimane could be observed with a maximum at mm azide yielding _PROTEIN_ bimane of total bimane labeled compounds compared with _PROTEIN_ bimane without azide min after mcb _PROTEIN_ . interestingly the conversion level of the gs conjugate to the cys adduct was higher in the presence of mm azide compared with noninhibited cells . in the presence of mm azide cys bimane accounted for of bimane labeled compounds while total recovery dropped to approximately in comparison with untreated cells . the lower recovery of inhibited cells may reflect stimulated secretion of bimane derivatives . vital staining of cells with fluorescein diacetate provided no evidence for the loss of cellular integrity by azide treatment . the determination of cellular gsh contents in the presence of various azide concentrations did not show significantly altered gsh/oxidized glutathione levels . subsequent time course experiments revealed maximum _PROTEIN_ bimane levels min after a pulse of mcb _PROTEIN_ . arabidopsis cells exposed to azide yielded a fold elevated _PROTEIN_ bimane level compared with the control . azide treatment did not prevent the degradation of gs bimane to cys bimane in wild type and pcs deficient cells . suspension cells of the pcs double knockout however showed no increase in _PROTEIN_ bimane levels . these data are consistent with an efficient pcs dependent generation of the cleavage product in the _LOCATION_ . the gs to cys conjugate conversion is slowed down in compared with the wild type in the presence of azide however the conversion in is little affected in the absence of the inhibitor indicating a compensatory turnover of the xenobiotic in the _LOCATION_ compartment . _PROTEIN_ has been identified as the critical player in the turnover of gs conjugates in the _LOCATION_ . to determine the contribution of _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ pathways to gs bimane catabolism we compared the gs bimane conversion in the knockout mutant the double mutant and the triple mutant . homozygous mutant and wild type seedlings were infiltrated with mcb and gs bimane degradation was subsequently analyzed . the _PROTEIN_ deficiency strongly inhibited gs conjugate catabolism and resulted in an approximately fold _PROTEIN_ in cys bimane levels while pcs deficiency in the line marginally affected cys bimane levels . the triple mutant and the line yielded comparable gs and cys conjugate levels but the _PROTEIN_ bimane level was approximately fold lower in the pcs deficient triple mutant . cysgly bimane levels were approximately fold lower in _PROTEIN_ deficient lines . the comparative analysis corroborates the importance of the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ for efficient gs to cys bimane catabolism . we conclude that pcs plays a major role in the metabolism of gs conjugates in the _LOCATION_ but only a minor role in the catabolism of gs conjugates that are efficiently sequestered in the _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ initiates the gs conjugate catabolic pathway that presumably occurs in the _LOCATION_ . the enzyme however has not explicitly been shown to reside in the _LOCATION_ . to address this open question arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ pcs _METHOD_ _METHOD_ chimeric proteins were generated by in frame fusion of the reporter gene to the last exon of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs encompass endogenous promoter sequences and the coding regions of the pcs genes . transient _PROTEIN_ analysis of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ revealed a _METHOD_ signal in arabidopsis protoplasts similar to _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of a constitutive promoter . similar experiments with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not yield detectable _METHOD_ signals consistent with no or a very low _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in leaf cells . subsequently the fusion constructs were introduced into wild type arabidopsis plants as well as in a mutant deficient in _PROTEIN_ and in the double pcs knockout line . for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ independent transgenic arabidopsis lines were identified in the wild type background and seven each in and in the double knockout . similarly independent _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transformants were recovered in the wild type and in pcs deficient lines . lines were selected for a segregation of kanamycin resistance in the progeny indicative of a single t dna insertion site and used in further experiments . to assess the functionality of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion we tested its ability to rescue the mutant phenotype of the line deficient in phytochelatin biosynthesis and impaired in gs conjugate catabolism . as _PROTEIN_ mutants have no reported phenotype our complementation analysis focused on _PROTEIN_ deficient plants . three lines homozygous for the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ integration were analyzed with respect to pc synthesis and cadmium tolerance . seedlings of these lines _PROTEIN_ to showed full restoration of pc synthesis and generation of and occurred as in the wild type . the cadmium concentration chosen for induction of pc synthesis is just sufficient to impose a mild growth inhibition of wild type roots in the range of . at residual growth was approximately for the wild type and for both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines while showed only of the control without cadmium . _PROTEIN_ of the pcs fusion protein restored cadmium tolerance in and also recovered catabolism of gs conjugate comparable to wild type plants . turnover of the _METHOD_ gs bimane conjugate in arabidopsis generates _PROTEIN_ bimane as a transient catabolite primarily by the action of _PROTEIN_ . protoplasts of the wild type and three complemented plants were _PROTEIN_ with mcb and had _PROTEIN_ bimane levels accounting for approximately and of all recovered gs bimane and bimane derivatives respectively . the level of _PROTEIN_ catabolites is increased in the presence of pcs activating heavy metal ions . under such conditions _PROTEIN_ bimane constituted of all recovered bimane conjugates in wild type seedlings h after exposure to mcb . in contrast the _PROTEIN_ bimane level in was below whereas in the pcs _PROTEIN_ lines the concentration increased to and respectively . taken together these findings document a successful complementation of by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . pcs might be a soluble or a _LOCATION_ associated protein . to address the issue of intracellular localization of _PROTEIN_ cell free extracts of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings were separated into a soluble protein fraction and a microsome enriched fraction by differential centrifugation . comparable protein levels from both fractions were analyzed for the presence of the tagged _PROTEIN_ protein by immunodetection . the _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was primarily detected in the soluble protein fraction at a molecular _METHOD_ of approximately kd which corresponds to the sum of kd for _PROTEIN_ and kd for _METHOD_ . the microsomal fraction yielded low levels of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ possibly due to a weak interaction of the fusion protein with _LOCATION_ or to a contamination of the fraction with soluble proteins as observed for the _METHOD_ control and indicated by the presence of rubisco . analyses of pcs _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ by confocal imaging revealed a major difference between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was readily detectable throughout the seedling . in contrast the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was consistently low in more than independent transgenic lines analyzed and the fusion protein was only detected in the root tip preferentially in the tunica . the low _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ however might have prevented the detection of the fusion protein in other parts of the seedling and also made it difficult to assess the intracellular localization of _PROTEIN_ other than to say that it resembled that of _PROTEIN_ described below . _PROTEIN_ was predominantly _PROTEIN_ in the epidermal layers of the shoot and root including root hairs but weakly _PROTEIN_ in guard cells . in epidermal cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was found in the _LOCATION_ where it could be seen in the cytoplasmic strands of the highly vacuolated cells . comparison of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines with marker lines in which _METHOD_ is targeted to specific organelles pointed to a similarity to soluble _METHOD_ which is found in the _LOCATION_ . the only difference observed was that whereas soluble _METHOD_ can be clearly detected in the _LOCATION_ of the control line the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion was not found in the _LOCATION_ . in some of the primary transformants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labeled diffuse reticulate structures in addition to the _LOCATION_ . the analysis of meristematic largely avacuolate cells of the root tip supported a _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ .
