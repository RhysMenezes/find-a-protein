transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ specifically interact with cis acting dehydration responsive element/c repeat involved in cold and drought stress responsive gene _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis thaliana . intact _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ does not activate downstream genes under normal growth conditions suggesting that _PROTEIN_ requires posttranslational modification for activation but the activation mechanism has not been clarified . _PROTEIN_ domain analysis using arabidopsis protoplasts identified a transcriptional activation domain between residues and and deletion of a region between residues and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to a constitutive active form . overexpression of constitutive active _PROTEIN_ resulted in significant drought stress tolerance but only slight freezing tolerance in transgenic arabidopsis plants . microarray and rna gel blot analyses revealed that _PROTEIN_ regulates _PROTEIN_ of many water stress inducible genes . however some genes downstream of _PROTEIN_ are not downstream of _PROTEIN_ which also recognizes dre/crt but functions in cold stress responsive gene _PROTEIN_ . synthetic green _METHOD_ protein gave a strong signal in the _LOCATION_ under unstressed control conditions when fused to constitutive active _PROTEIN_ but only a weak signal when fused to full length _PROTEIN_ . the region between _PROTEIN_ residues and plays a role in the stability of this protein in the _LOCATION_ which is important for protein activation .
because the c terminal region of _PROTEIN_ is rich in acidic amino acids the transcriptional activation domain of _PROTEIN_ has been predicted to exist in this region . to identify the transcriptional activation domain of _PROTEIN_ we performed transactivation experiments using protoplasts prepared from arabidopsis suspension cultured cells . according to the results of the chou fasman analysis for prediction of secondary structure the c terminal half of the _PROTEIN_ protein from just behind the dna binding domain to the c terminal end of the protein is divided into five parts . we constructed a series of effector plasmids without each part of _PROTEIN_ and a reporter plasmid having a _PROTEIN_ reporter gene driven by three copies of a dre sequence . these plasmids were cotransfected into arabidopsis protoplasts and then transactivation of the reporter gene was analyzed . as shown in figure coexpression of the full length _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cdna resulted in to times higher transactivation of the reporter gene than without _PROTEIN_ . deletion of the c terminal region between amino acids and the c terminal end of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transactivation of the reporter gene to the basal level _PROTEIN_ . on the other hand an internal deletion mutant lacking the region between amino acids and showed a similar activation level as that of the _PROTEIN_ fl _PROTEIN_ . these results indicate that the c terminal region of _PROTEIN_ between amino acids and the c terminal end is required for transcriptional activation . interestingly deletion of the region between amino acids and of _PROTEIN_ resulted in a significant increase of its activity _PROTEIN_ . coexpression of this effector plasmid transactivated the gus reporter gene times higher than the basal level and three times higher than that of the _PROTEIN_ fl . this level of activation was equivalent to that of the _PROTEIN_ effector construct . we could not detect this kind of high activation using _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ with the other regions deleted therefore we named this construct the constitutive active form of _PROTEIN_ . these results suggest the presence of a negative regulatory domain in the region between amino acids and . to further analyze the activation domain of _PROTEIN_ we prepared fusion genes that consist of the dna binding domain of the yeast transcriptional activator and various _PROTEIN_ fragments . the effector plasmids were cotransfected into protoplasts of arabidopsis cells with a reporter plasmid that contains nine copies of a binding site fused to the camv minimal promoter and the gus reporter gene . as shown in figure effector constructs of gb _PROTEIN_ and gb _PROTEIN_ that lack the region between amino acid and the c terminal end of _PROTEIN_ did not activate the _PROTEIN_ of the reporter gene . the effector construct gb _PROTEIN_ containing the region from amino acid to the c terminal end of _PROTEIN_ showed the highest activation levels of the reporter gene among all effector constructs . when the fragment of gb _PROTEIN_ was extended toward the n terminus no further increase of reporter activity was observed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the region between amino acids and was divided into three parts and analyzed to identify the minimum activation domain of _PROTEIN_ . each part could not or could only weakly stimulate the _PROTEIN_ of the reporter gene when it was fused to the binding domain _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and a deletion of at least one part significantly _PROTEIN_ the activity of the gus reporter compared with gb _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . although the effector construct gb _PROTEIN_ induced reporter gene _PROTEIN_ at almost the same level as did gb _PROTEIN_ transactivation by gb _PROTEIN_ which contains the region between amino acids and was approximately one sixth that of gb _PROTEIN_ . these results indicate that the region between amino acids and functions as an activation domain of _PROTEIN_ and that the region between amino acids and negatively controls the transcriptional activation ability of _PROTEIN_ . figure shows schematic _METHOD_ of the _PROTEIN_ fl and the constitutive active form of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is predicted to have _LOCATION_ localization signals in its n terminal region . the _LOCATION_ dna binding domain and an activation domain exist in the central region and the c terminal region respectively . _PROTEIN_ also contains a negative regulatory domain adjoining the dna binding domain . _PROTEIN_ ca can be generated by deletion of this negative regulatory domain . to analyze the function of _PROTEIN_ we overexpressed _PROTEIN_ ca _PROTEIN_ which gave the highest activity in the transient transactivation experiments in arabidopsis plants . this constitutive active form of _PROTEIN_ was overexpressed under the control of the enhanced camv promoter . the tobacco mosaic virus sequence was inserted upstream of the mutant _PROTEIN_ fragment to increase the translational level . fifty five transgenic arabidopsis plants were generated using the vacuum infiltration method . _PROTEIN_ levels of the transgene in these transgenic plants were analyzed by rna gel blot analysis and we selected three lines _PROTEIN_ ca a _PROTEIN_ ca b and _PROTEIN_ ca c that showed strong moderate and weak transgene _PROTEIN_ respectively for further analysis . we observed the growth of the _PROTEIN_ ca plants under normal growing conditions and compared them with control plants containing the vector and _PROTEIN_ fl plants overexpressing the _PROTEIN_ fl cdna . all the _PROTEIN_ ca plants showed significant growth retardation compared with the control plants and the level of retardation was correlated with the levels of _PROTEIN_ of the transgene and of a _PROTEIN_ target gene _PROTEIN_ . by contrast only very weak growth retardation was observed in _PROTEIN_ fl plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ fl . the _PROTEIN_ ca plants had rounded slightly darker leaves with short petioles . these phenotypes appeared in the _PROTEIN_ ca a plants more notably than in the _PROTEIN_ c plants . to determine the genes downstream of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis we performed array analysis using a full length cdna microarray containing arabidopsis full length cdnas . we used three independent transgenic arabidopsis plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ ca _PROTEIN_ ca a _PROTEIN_ ca b and _PROTEIN_ ca c. and labeled cdna probes were prepared from mrnas isolated from the _PROTEIN_ ca and control plants respectively grown under unstressed control conditions . these probes were hybridized with the cdna microarray and the _PROTEIN_ profiles of the genes were analyzed . to assess the reproducibility we repeated each experiment three times and further analyzed the genes showing a signal intensity > in at least one experiment . table lists the genes whose _PROTEIN_ was increased more than five times in the _PROTEIN_ ca a plants . we _PROTEIN_ genes with an _PROTEIN_ ratio > in the _PROTEIN_ ca a plants as candidates for _PROTEIN_ downstream genes . seventeen genes were identified as candidates by cdna microarray analysis . _PROTEIN_ ratios of most identified genes were correlated with levels of mrna accumulation of _PROTEIN_ ca among the three transgenic lines . microarray analysis of _PROTEIN_ ca plants in our previous study the _PROTEIN_ protein specifically bound to six nucleotides of the dre core motif . we searched for this core motif in the promoter regions of the identified genes . the bp promoter regions upstream of putative transcriptional initiation sites that are the ends of the full length cdna clones were used for this search . we found the dre motif in the promoter region of genes . because many stress inducible genes that have the dre motif contain the abscisic acid responsive element _PROTEIN_ core motif in their promoter regions we also searched for _PROTEIN_ in the promoter regions of the genes . thirteen contained the _PROTEIN_ motif and contained both dre and _PROTEIN_ motifs in their bp promoter regions . as the _PROTEIN_ protein was also reported to bind specifically to the dre core motif we compared these genes with the genes downstream of _PROTEIN_ identified by citation . we found only eight genes in common . for further analysis of the genes that are upregulated by overexpression of _PROTEIN_ ca we performed rna gel blot analysis . the total rnas isolated from the wild type _PROTEIN_ b _PROTEIN_ ca a _PROTEIN_ ca b and _PROTEIN_ ca c plants with or without stress treatments of dehydration for h and for h were used for rna gel blot analysis . the _PROTEIN_ b plants corresponded to _PROTEIN_ described by citation and this line showed moderate phenotypic change among the _PROTEIN_ overexpressors . figure shows _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transgenes in the transgenic plants . _PROTEIN_ was overexpressed in the _PROTEIN_ b transgenic plants and the active form of _PROTEIN_ was overproduced in the _PROTEIN_ ca transgenic plants . we subjected genes whose _PROTEIN_ ratios were > and the genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _GENE_ to rna gel blot analysis . these latter genes except for _GENE_ have dre in their promoter regions and showed _PROTEIN_ of > in transgenic plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ whereas the _PROTEIN_ ratios in the _PROTEIN_ ca a plants were < . although the _PROTEIN_ ratio of _GENE_ in the _PROTEIN_ ca a plants was we confirmed the _PROTEIN_ of this gene using rna gel blot analysis as it encodes an interesting protein a transcription _PROTEIN_ that contains the _LOCATION_ dna binding domain suggesting the existence of further regulation of gene _PROTEIN_ downstream of _PROTEIN_ . rna gel blot analysis showed that accumulation of mrnas of genes under unstressed control conditions was increased in the _PROTEIN_ ca plants compared with that in the wild type plants but not in the _PROTEIN_ b plants . most of these genes responded to drought and/or cold stress in the wild type plants in particular accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ transcripts increased in response to drought stress treatment . figure shows genes that were induced equivalently in the _PROTEIN_ b plants and the _PROTEIN_ ca plants . although _GENE_ and _PROTEIN_ were overexpressed in the _PROTEIN_ b plants and have dres in their promoter regions their _PROTEIN_ was not increased in the _PROTEIN_ ca plants . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was increased in both the _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ ca plants but their _PROTEIN_ levels were much higher in the _PROTEIN_ b plants than in the _PROTEIN_ ca plants . to understand why several genes downstream of _PROTEIN_ are different from those downstream of _PROTEIN_ we compared the dre sequences in the promoter regions of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ upregulated genes . the genes listed in figures and were selected as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ upregulated genes respectively . we searched for the dre core motif in the promoter regions of the genes using the bp promoter regions upstream of putative transcriptional initiation sites at the end of the full length cdna clones for this search . we found and dre sequences in the promoter regions of the _PROTEIN_ upregulated and _PROTEIN_ upregulated genes respectively and analyzed them with neighboring nucleotides using the sequence logo _METHOD_ . recently we reported that the _PROTEIN_ protein has the highest affinity to the a/gccgacnt sequence which we determined by detailed analysis of the promoter region of the _PROTEIN_ downstream genes . we found a/gccgacnt in the promoter regions of of the _PROTEIN_ upregulated genes . however only four dre sequences were a/gccgacnt in the promoter regions of the _PROTEIN_ upregulated genes . although the last t of a/gccgacnt is critical for the binding affinity of the _PROTEIN_ protein to dre the binding affinity of the _PROTEIN_ protein may not be affected by a base substitution at the corresponding position of dre . to confirm this hypothesis we performed a gel mobility shift assay with dna fragments containing the accgacat or accgacaa/c/g sequences as competitors . addition of the unlabeled dna fragment containing accgacat reduced the extent of binding of _PROTEIN_ more effectively than that of the unlabeled dna fragment containing accgacaa/c/g . on the other hand we could not detect a difference in the binding affinity of _PROTEIN_ between the dna fragments containing accgacat and those containing accgacaa/c/g . among the dre sequences found in the promoter sequences of the _PROTEIN_ upregulated genes contained gccgac and contained accgac as the dre core motifs . this low frequency of g at this nucleotide position suggests low binding affinity of the _PROTEIN_ protein to the gccgac sequence . to analyze binding characteristics of _PROTEIN_ to accgac and gccgac we performed a gel mobility shift assay using bp dna fragments containing a/c/g/tccgac . the addition of unlabeled accgacat or gccgacat competitors inhibited the binding of the _PROTEIN_ protein equivalently . by contrast the addition of an unlabeled accgacat fragment was more effective at binding the _PROTEIN_ protein than the addition of an unlabeled dna fragment containing c/g/tccgacat . we compared the drought and freezing stress tolerance of the _PROTEIN_ ca plants with that of the _PROTEIN_ b and wild type plants . the plants were grown on germination medium agar plates for weeks then transferred to soil and grown for week at . for drought stress treatment water was withheld for weeks . they were then watered and grown under control conditions for d. this treatment killed all wild type plants but of the _PROTEIN_ b plants survived . like _PROTEIN_ b the _PROTEIN_ ca plants exhibited tolerance to drought with survival rates of to . for the freezing stress treatment the plants were exposed to a temperature of for h and returned to for d. all the wild type plants died in this treatment whereas of the _PROTEIN_ b plants survived . by contrast only to of the _PROTEIN_ ca plants survived . these results indicate that the genes downstream of _PROTEIN_ play an important role in drought stress tolerance but are not sufficient to withstand freezing stress . we have reported that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ driven by the stress inducible _PROTEIN_ promoter is able to improve plant stress tolerance significantly with minimum growth retardation . because overexpression of _PROTEIN_ ca with the camv promoter showed a negative effect on plant growth we tried to use this technique to overexpress _PROTEIN_ ca . we generated transgenic plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ ca cdna driven by the _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . accumulation of _PROTEIN_ mrna and of mrnas of its downstream gene _PROTEIN_ in these transgenic plants was analyzed by quantitative rt pcr . we selected lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ca a and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ca b for further analysis . we compared these two lines with wild type and _PROTEIN_ ca b plants . _PROTEIN_ of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was enhanced in the _PROTEIN_ ca b plants even under unstressed condition . by contrast _PROTEIN_ levels of these genes in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ca a and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ca b plants under unstressed conditions were relatively low compared with those in _PROTEIN_ ca b . after min of dehydration _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ca a plants was increased by and times respectively compared with that in the wild type plants . growth of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ca plants was compared with that of the wild type and _PROTEIN_ ca b plants . figure shows week old plants of the wild type _PROTEIN_ ca b _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ca a and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ca b . unlike the _PROTEIN_ ca b plants there were no significant differences in growth between the vector control and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ca plants . we then analyzed seed yields of these plants . the seed yield of _PROTEIN_ ca b was reduced to of the wild type . by contrast the seed yield of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ca a plants was similar to that of wild type plants grown under control conditions and that of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ca b plants was of the wild type . the tolerance of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ca plants to drought was compared with that of the _PROTEIN_ ca b and wild type plants . plants grown in pots were not watered for weeks . only of the wild type plants survived . however the survival rates of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ca a and b plants were much higher at and respectively . to study subcellular accumulation patterns of the _PROTEIN_ fl protein and the _PROTEIN_ ca protein we constructed chimeric genes with the synthetic green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ gene fused to _PROTEIN_ fl cdna _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ ca cdna _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the fusion genes were introduced into arabidopsis plants and were overexpressed under the control of the camv promoter . as a control the _METHOD_ gene was also overexpressed in transgenic arabidopsis plants . two lines of transgenic plants were analyzed for each _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct . the accumulation of mrna of each fusion gene was almost the same among the four lines of transgenic plants . however _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene in the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fl plants was remarkably lower than that in the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ ca plants . moreover in the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fl plants only very weak green _METHOD_ signals were observed in the _LOCATION_ . by contrast strong green _METHOD_ signals were clearly observed in the _LOCATION_ of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ ca plants . these results suggest that the _PROTEIN_ ca protein is more stable than the _PROTEIN_ fl protein in the _LOCATION_ of the transgenic plant .
