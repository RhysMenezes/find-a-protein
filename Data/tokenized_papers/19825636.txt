insertion mutations that disrupt the function of cause nacl hypersensitivity of arabidopsis seedlings that is characterized by reduced growth of the primary root enhanced _PROTEIN_ branching and swelling of root tips . mutant phenotypes were exacerbated by sucrose but not by equiosmolar concentrations of mannitol and attenuated by low inorganic phosphate in the medium . protein belongs to the major facilitator superfamily of permeases that shares significant sequence similarity to mammalian type i pi transporters and vesicular glutamate transporters and is a member of the family of putative intracellular phosphate transporters of plants . localizes to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and transport studies indicate that facilitates the selective transport of pi but not of chloride or inorganic anions . phenotypic similarities with other mutants displaying root swelling suggest that likely functions in protein n glycosylation and cell wall biosynthesis which are essential for salt tolerance . together our results indicate that transports pi out of the _LOCATION_ lumenal space for the re cycling of the pi released from glycosylation processes .
a population of t dna insertion lines in the arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ luc genetic background was screened for nacl sensitivity based primarily on the analysis of root growth inhibition and a mutant _PROTEIN_ designated was identified . on medium supplemented with mm nacl seedlings exhibited cessation of primary root growth swelling of primary root tip and hairs and development of short and swollen _PROTEIN_ roots . the nacl induced root swelling of seedlings was due primarily to radial expansion of epidermal and cortical cells in the elongation zone . cells of the stele were morphologically normal except that the meristem at the tip of primary and secondary roots exhibited cessation or reduction in the cell division activity . cell files in the primary root elongation zone of seedlings appeared undisturbed by nacl stress even in tissues peripheral to the meristem where radial expansion occurs . despite the distorted anatomy of cells exhibited by in the elongation zone of seedling roots after growth on medium with mm nacl for d most roots re initiated cell division and longitudinal expansion after transfer to medium without salt supplement . however prolonged culture of seedlings on agar medium resulted in slight swelling of the root tip and increased _PROTEIN_ root branching even in the absence of salt stress . _PROTEIN_ of the severity of nacl stress neither wild type nor _PROTEIN_ seedlings exhibited the aberrant root swelling or _PROTEIN_ branching phenotype of seedlings . the _PROTEIN_ mutation is a t dna insertion in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ luc genetic background that renders the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ na /h antiporter _PROTEIN_ dysfunctional . the shoot _METHOD_ of seedlings on medium with nacl was similar to wild type . in standard in vitro growth conditions seedlings exhibited slightly more vigorous shoot and root growth than wild type seedlings and an increase in _PROTEIN_ branching but without root tip swelling . caulinar leaves of greenhouse grown plants expanded more slowly . it is worth noting that growth of mutant seedlings in liquid medium caused moderate root swelling _METHOD_ that were alleviated by increasing the density of the medium with the addition of low agar concentrations . unlike the rsw mutants root swelling did not occur at high temperature in seedlings . the t dna insertion in plants is located bp upstream of the translational start of locus which has been previously named _PROTEIN_ and . full length transcript was not detected by rt pcr analysis in seedlings indicating that the allele is dysfunctional . t plants homozygous for were backcrossed to wild type _PROTEIN_ and f progeny exhibited wild type growth on medium with mm nacl . f analysis established a segregation ratio of for nacl tolerance sensitivity indicating that is a monogenic recessive mutation . pcr analysis of nacl sensitive f plants established that all were homozygous for the allele at the locus indicating that the t dna insertion is linked tightly to the nacl sensitive phenotype displayed by seedlings . an in silico analysis of the arabidopsis t dna g.a.r.l.i.c population identified line which has a t dna insertion that is located bp downstream of the initiation codon in and that is denoted here as allele . a minority of t progeny of line segregated for salt sensitivity on medium supplemented with mm nacl . these salt sensitive seedlings exhibited a similar phenotype to that of seedlings . all of the nacl sensitive seedlings in the t population were homozygous for the allele and mrna was not detected in seedlings . all f progeny of x or x exhibited similar nacl sensitivity as or seedlings . genotypic analysis confirmed the presence of both and alleles in all f hybrids and mrna was not detected in any of the f progeny . these results indicate that and are allelic and that both mutations cause dysfunctional alleles that result in nacl sensitivity . the gene encodes a putative amino acid peptide that based on primary and secondary structure is predicted to be a member of the major facilitator superfamily of permeases . mfs is a large and diverse family of single polypeptide carriers transporting low molecular _METHOD_ solutes across various cell _LOCATION_ that are capable of mediating either influx or efflux of solutes using uniport symport or antiport _METHOD_ . computational analyses indicates that contains tm regions arranged in two groups of six tm units separated by a _LOCATION_ loop between residues and . the protein encoded by locus was initially annotated to be a putative anion/cation co transporter based on its sequence homology to mammalian brain specific and differentiation associated na dependent inorganic phosphate co transporters bnpi and dnpi respectively . subsequently however these vertebrate proteins have been shown to function as vesicular glutamate transporters and are now termed and respectively . these proteins and the homolog are localized to synaptic vesicles of glutamatergic neurons where they mediate the loading of the neurotransmitter glutamate into vesicles by h gradient dependent uptake . the homologous protein napi from rabbit kidney cells was the first characterized na pi co transporter from vertebrates but further studies have shown that napi is permeant to chloride and organic anions in xenopus oocytes . besides the homology to the vesicular organic anion transporter subfamily of vertebrate mfs has identity to sialin a lysosomal transporter involved in the efflux of free monocarboxylated monosaccharides released from recycled glycoproteins and glycolipids . in turn sialin clusters together with vglut proteins and other vesicular organic anion transporters on the phylogenetic tree . the capacity for sialic acid biosynthesis is thought not to exist in plants but sialylation of glycoconjugates has been described recently for plant cell cultures including those of arabidopsis thaliana . in spite of its similarity to sialin shares very weak homology to well characterized mfs sugar transporters of arabidopsis like the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ monosaccharyde proton symporter _PROTEIN_ and the _LOCATION_ gdp mannose transporter _PROTEIN_ or with the sialate transporter of e. coli nant . recently has been characterized within a six gene family referred to as based on their proposed role in intracellular transport of inorganic phosphate . all of the proteins mediate pi uptake in whole cells of yeast with high specificity . sequence homologies among proteins are as determined by the alignment program clustalx . and pht are localized to the chloroplast . co localized with a _LOCATION_ marker and the localization of remains unresolved . all six proteins cluster together in the phylogenetic tree to a clade that contains the vertebrate proteins vglut and sialin . notably however shares only identity with other proteins which is not significantly greater than its homology to vgluts and sialin despite the evolutionary distance between plants and vertebrates . considering the homology between and other transporters that are permeant to sodium phosphate chloride and organic anions or sugars the mutant was subjected to a more detailed characterization of ionic osmotic and sugar sensitivity . root elongation was used as an indicator of the response of to various salt and sugar treatments . mutant was hypersensitive to nacl and kcl stress as shown by root growth inhibition and swelling in the root elongation area but not to licl . in contrast seedlings were only moderately sensitive to equimolar concentrations of na and k supplied as sulfate salts which could indicate a moderate sensitivity of to cl . however there was no significant difference in ion contents between wild type and plants either with or without nacl treatment when the accumulation of na k and cl was compared . the faster growth of seedlings in licl compared to wild type likely resulted form their more vigorous growth in plates in the absence of stress . together these data suggested the lack of ionic sensitivity . to determine whether plants are hypersensitive to general osmotic stress root elongation in response to different concentrations of mannitol and sucrose was measured . seedlings of genotype were not hypersensitive to osmotic stress caused by mannitol but were hypersensitive to equiosmolar concentrations of sucrose . figure sucrose sensitivity of mutants is not caused by osmotic stress . four day old wild type and seedlings were transferred to _METHOD_ medium supplemented with or mm sucrose as indicated and incubated for seven additional days . sucrose sensitivity of mutants is not caused by osmotic stress . four day old wild type and seedlings were transferred to _METHOD_ medium supplemented with or mm sucrose as indicated and incubated for seven additional days . the _PROTEIN_ that is permeant to inorganic phosphate led us to test whether the phenotype was due to impaired pi homeostasis . a root elongation assay was performed on pi free _METHOD_ medium supplemented with or mm k po and with or without mm nacl . seeds were germinated first on _METHOD_ agar medium and day old seedlings were then transferred to various media . seven days after being transferred both wild type and seedlings had little new root growth in pi free medium but seedlings did not show a significant increase in _PROTEIN_ root development or in root tip swelling both in nacl free and nacl containing media . however salt induced primary root growth inhibition _PROTEIN_ root development and root swelling of seedlings are more evident on pi supplemented medium and greatly suppressed in low pi . the sub cellular localization of was determined by using a chimaeric protein consisting of fused at its c terminus to _METHOD_ that was transiently _PROTEIN_ in onion epidermal cells after biolistic transformation or constitutively _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis transgenic lines . transformed onion epidermal cells showed h after bombardment a punctate pattern of small and motile _METHOD_ bodies evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm in the cell cortex transvacuolar strands and perinuclear region . an identical _METHOD_ pattern was observed in transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ did not co localize with mitochondria labeled with mitotracker red . the size and shape of the _METHOD_ bodies labeled by _METHOD_ were consistent with the organization of _LOCATION_ stacks in plant cells and identical to that of a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ translational fusion . _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ localized gdp mannose transporter of arabidopsis . to test further the nature of these _METHOD_ structures we analyzed their sensitivity to brefeldin a . bfa disrupts of the anterograde vesicle transport from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ apparatus and its morphologically detectable effects range from the loss of cis cisternae and a concomitant increase in trans cisternae to the accumulation of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in highly vesiculated clusters and in some cases the fusion of the _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . when onion epidermal peels _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were incubated in bfa for h the _METHOD_ pattern within the cells changed from numerous small punctate bodies to a few large aggregated structures as well as a diffuse _METHOD_ labeling of the cytoplasm more evident in the perinuclear region . as control the bfa treatment of onion cells _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion elicited an identical shift in the number and size of _METHOD_ structures . the _METHOD_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ was not altered in cells of onion peels incubated for more than h without added bfa . to further validate the results obtained by transient _PROTEIN_ assays of _METHOD_ in onion epidermal cells mutant arabidopsis lines and and their parental wild type lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ luc and col were transformed with plasmid pbib _METHOD_ and three independent transgenic homozygous lines from each transformation were selected for further characterization . under confocal microscopy all transgenic lines tested showed the same bfa sensitive _METHOD_ punctate pattern found in transient _PROTEIN_ assays in both young roots and aerial tissues . these results strongly support the localization of in the _LOCATION_ apparatus . additional proof that the _LOCATION_ apparatus is the bona fide sub cellular localization of the _METHOD_ tagged and that mutations are responsible for the mutant phenotype the salt sensitivity of transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was tested in root elongation assays . constitutive _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ in the and genetic backgrounds restored salt tolerance to a level comparable to those of their isogenic wild type lines . these results demonstrate that _METHOD_ complements mutations and and strongly support the _LOCATION_ localization of the protein . notably overexpression of _METHOD_ in a wild type genetic background caused a slight but consistent growth delay which is reciprocal to the faster growth of mutants in solid _METHOD_ plates . the phenotypic suppression of mutation in low phosphate and the sequence similarity to chloride transport proteins suggested that could transport one or both of these inorganic anions . chloride and phosphate transport was experimentally tested by complementation analysis of yeast mutants . the _METHOD_ chimera localized _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of yeast cells although a few punctuate bodies that may correspond to _LOCATION_ stacks were also labeled . strain lacks the voltage gated chloride channel localized to _LOCATION_ of the _LOCATION_ and prevacuolar compartment and is sensitive to hygromycin and mncl . the _PROTEIN_ of in strain did not complement the phenotype at any condition tested . these results suggest that is unlikely to permeate chloride . plasmid _PROTEIN_ was also transformed into the yeast strain _PROTEIN_ . this strain is deficient in the high affinity phosphate/proton and phosphate/sodium symport _METHOD_ both functioning at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ lacks the periplasmic acid phosphatase and is unable to grow in pi depleted media . complementation analyses were carried out in pi free ynb medium and in the same medium supplemented with or mm sodium phosphate at ph and and with or without mm nacl . the results showed that failed to complement the _PROTEIN_ phenotype in all these conditions . however lack of complementation could be due to the preferential localization of to the yeast _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . therefore _LOCATION_ of cells _PROTEIN_ were isolated and transport of radio labeled pi was measured . first the rate of net uptake was measured in _LOCATION_ isolated from wild type cells transformed with plasmid _PROTEIN_ or with an empty vector . as depicted in the net accumulation rate of pi was lower in vesicles containing in other words this protein counter acted pi uptake . by contrast did not alter the capacity of _LOCATION_ vesicles to establish a proton gradient upon the addition of _PROTEIN_ and no differences were found in the transport of aspartate and glutamate . these data indicated that transported pi selectively and suggested that this protein facilitated efflux rather than uptake . to test this further vesicles were pre loaded with pi _PROTEIN_ potassium phosphate and then transferred to potassium _PROTEIN_ to measure pi loss . the results showed a bell shaped curve with a somehow faster pi release from vesicles compared to control vesicles . these flux experiments were done twice with similar results . the bell shaped kinetics of pi transport by yeast _LOCATION_ have been described before and results from counter flow exchange with pi present in the _LOCATION_ at the time of their isolation that is faster than unidirectional pi efflux . in spite of the complex kinetics pi inside the vesicles containing was lower at all time points after transfer to pi free buffer . together these results strongly suggest that facilitates the transport of pi from the lumenal space towards the _LOCATION_ . because of the significant sequence similarities with vglut proteins and sialin a role of in the transport of the organic anions glutamate and sialic acid was also tested . bacteria have several different l glutamate transport _METHOD_ one of which comprises the gltp/glts uptake system of e. coli . gltp and proteins share the sodium dicarboxylate symporter family signature located in the fifth and eighth tm domains of . cells of e. coli strain can not grow in medium with glutamate as a sole _PROTEIN_ and nitrogen source unless glts or gltp glutamate/aspartate carriers are overexpressed . we took advantage of the limited capacity for glutamate uptake of e. coli cells and transformed the full length cdna of into bacteria using the plasmid for arabinose dependent _PROTEIN_ . growth assays in non repressed induced conditions showed that the overexpression of in e. coli transformants did not improve their ability to grow on glutamate as the sole _PROTEIN_ source . negative results were also obtained in c glutamate and c aspartate transport assays in e. coli cells transformed with . lastly transport assays of c glutamate c aspartate and c glycine were performed with _LOCATION_ vesicles isolated from yeast cells transformed with plasmid _PROTEIN_ as described also with negative results . e. coli strain is able to use sialic acid as the sole _PROTEIN_ ability dependent on the product of genes nant and _PROTEIN_ . bacteria bearing a nant mutation are unable to grow on sialic acid as the sole _PROTEIN_ source whereas _PROTEIN_ mutants are sensitive to concentrations of sialic acid as low as mm due to the toxic effect of sialic acid accumulation within the cell . the cdna was _PROTEIN_ in e. coli cells deficient in the sialic acid permease nant and in the aldolase _PROTEIN_ by transformation with plasmid pbad . growth tests showed that the _PROTEIN_ of did not alter the growth of bacteria on sialic acid as the sole _PROTEIN_ source of strains _PROTEIN_ and . transport assays of c sialic acid in yeast _LOCATION_ vesicles also produced negative results . together these results indicate that is unable to transport organic anions despite its significant sequence similarity to vertebrate vglut proteins and sialin . to determine the _PROTEIN_ pattern and regulation of the genes we performed rt pcr analysis on total rna from wild type and seedlings subjected to different stress treatments . the transcript was detected in low amounts in shoots and roots with relatively higher abundance in the latter . the level of transcript in young seedlings remained unchanged after nacl treatment and was independent of the presence of pi in the growth medium . unlike and other members of the gene family _PROTEIN_ was up regulated by nacl . to determine whether up regulation by nacl was affected by the gene _PROTEIN_ was determined in the mutant . there was no significant difference between _PROTEIN_ in the wild type and the mutant indicating that there is no compensation at the transcriptional level in response to the dysfunctional allele . the root branching phenotype of mutant seedlings is not due to abnormal phosphate starvation sensing as indicated by the unaltered _PROTEIN_ pattern in the background of the pi starvation induced gene _PROTEIN_ . does not affect the signaling pathway that regulates the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ as no difference in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pattern was observed in wild type and backgrounds by rt pcr and by _PROTEIN_ luc imaging after aba cold or nacl treatment .
