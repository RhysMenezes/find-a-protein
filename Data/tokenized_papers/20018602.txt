cell division depends on the correct localization of the cyclin dependent kinases that are regulated by phosphorylation cyclin proteolysis and protein protein interactions . although immunological assays can define cell cycle protein abundance and localization they are not suitable for detecting the dynamic rearrangements of molecular components during cell division . here we applied an in vivo approach to trace the subcellular localization of arabidopsis core cell cycle proteins fused to green _METHOD_ proteins during cell division in tobacco and arabidopsis . several cell cycle proteins showed a dynamic association with mitotic structures such as condensed chromosomes and the preprophase band in both species suggesting a strong conservation of targeting _METHOD_ . furthermore colocalized proteins were shown to bind in vivo strengthening their localization function connection . thus we identified unknown spatiotemporal territories where functional cell cycle protein interactions are most likely to occur .
open reading frames of core cell cycle proteins were c terminally fused to _METHOD_ with the gateway technology and stably _PROTEIN_ in tobacco cells . the selected proteins included previously annotated core cell cycle proteins and three proteins recently implicated in cell cycle control namely _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and cdkg . c terminal tagging was chosen to avoid the _PROTEIN_ of truncated protein fusions . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were n terminally tagged because the c terminal constructs did not yield _METHOD_ signals . the functionality of c terminal fusions of cdka and had been confirmed previously by mutant complementation analysis . the n terminal fusion of _PROTEIN_ rescued the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype similarly to the c terminal construct under the control of the endogenous promoter . single and time course images were analyzed for at least two independent transformation events to ensure consistency of the observed localization patterns . our results provide localization data for of the analyzed proteins . the remaining two proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were not imaged due to the absence of _METHOD_ signal . of the transformed constructs were followed during division by time lapse imaging for only single images of cell division were recorded whereas for the remaining only interphase cells were imaged . the images and movies showing tagged proteins in interphase as well as during division were gathered in a publicly available online database _METHOD_ . cells are very amenable to rapid cell biological analysis of cell division related processes . we took advantage of these assets and initially analyzed the cell cycle fusion constructs in transformed callus cultures . the interphase cells were marked by an intact _LOCATION_ envelope and visible nucleolus in the differential interference contrast channel . the majority of the core cell cycle proteins localized exclusively to the _LOCATION_ or to both the _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm namely and proteins respectively and four proteins localized to the cytoplasm only . as expected cyclins showed the most variable localization patterns in interphase cells of which cyclins including types _PROTEIN_ and were _LOCATION_ four _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were exclusively cytoplasmic and four _PROTEIN_ were present in both compartments . interestingly besides the _LOCATION_ localization a nucleolar localization was observed in cells _PROTEIN_ fusion protein . in spite of being driven by the promoter a type and b type cyclins were _PROTEIN_ at relatively low levels or were unstable in the interphase cells as inferred by the weak _METHOD_ signals . the a type and b type cdks were distributed in both the _LOCATION_ and the cytoplasm in contrast to some members of the cdk families of type c e and g which were predominantly _LOCATION_ . the cdk cyclin complex inhibitors _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were exclusively _LOCATION_ whereas _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were also detected in the cytoplasm . of all _LOCATION_ krps _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ showed a more complex subcellular patterning which included the association with distinct punctate structures inside the _LOCATION_ . the cdk activating kinases cdkd and cdkf localized to the _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm whereas cdkd and cdkd were retained solely inside the _LOCATION_ . different localization patterns were observed for the transcription _PROTEIN_ the two dps and were _LOCATION_ and cytoplasmic while _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were exclusively _LOCATION_ . both cdk subunits _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were highly and homogenously _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ and the cytoplasm while the two components of the anaphase promoting complex _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ localized to the _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm where _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ associated with multiple punctae . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins localized exclusively to the _LOCATION_ . to build a more comprehensive map of the localization patterns of core cell cycle proteins time lapse recordings were made throughout mitosis . after _LOCATION_ envelope breakdown in _PROTEIN_ prophase the majority of the _METHOD_ cell cycle proteins diffused into the cytoplasm and did not associate with any particular structures . after completion of cytokinesis and formation of the daughter _LOCATION_ the localization remained as in the interphase cells . during cell division the _METHOD_ signal occurred in the cytoplasm at the spindle position whereas afterward the labeling diffused to the phragmoplast and was absent from the cell plate . in contrast a set of proteins consisting of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ localized to chromosomes in prophase metaphase or anaphase . although these proteins localized to similar mitotic structures different dynamic patterns were observed . for example the _METHOD_ signal of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion associated with the condensing chromosomes from prophase persisted at the equatorial plane when the chromosome _METHOD_ were fully condensed and diffused during anaphase when sister chromatids separated whereas _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ did not diffuse away from the chromosome _METHOD_ after metaphase but their chromosomal signal persisted throughout telophase and cytokinesis and remained associated with the _LOCATION_ when chromatin decondensed . analysis of the timing of the chromosomal association and _METHOD_ disappearance revealed that a type and _PROTEIN_ type cyclins disappeared before the chromosome separation . in contrast the _METHOD_ signals of _PROTEIN_ type cyclins _PROTEIN_ proteins and _PROTEIN_ persisted only until anaphase and some weak _METHOD_ was observed in the region of the spindle during metaphase and anaphase . interestingly was observed on condensing prophase chromatin but this protein no longer associated with the aligned metaphase chromosomes . to more accurately time the dynamics of the _METHOD_ patterning _METHOD_ tagged and red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged versions of the cell cycle proteins were coexpressed and simultaneously monitored . for example the colocalization of _PROTEIN_ with either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ was analyzed . both pairs of _METHOD_ proteins associated with the condensing chromosomes however while the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was visible until mid anaphase the _METHOD_ signal of _PROTEIN_ disappeared in early anaphase . a mitosis specific protein association distinct from that mentioned above was visible for _PROTEIN_ but not for its close homolog _PROTEIN_ . at the onset of mitosis the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion localized to the _LOCATION_ and to cytoplasmic punctae . in metaphase the _METHOD_ labeled punctae moved from the cell cortex toward the division plane and the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein accumulated in the zone around and between the condensed chromosomes in metaphase . interestingly the _PROTEIN_ protein transiently accumulated at the _PROTEIN_ . besides _PROTEIN_ several other proteins localized to the _PROTEIN_ namely _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . all of them transiently marked the _PROTEIN_ zone and while _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ associated with the chromosomes _PROTEIN_ was excluded from the metaphase plate but was present at the spindle and disappeared before anaphase . to determine the localization of the core cell cycle proteins in a tissue context all _METHOD_ fusion constructs were stably transformed in arabidopsis and homozygous lines exhibiting no macroscopic phenotypes were selected for further analysis . several endogenous promoter open reading frame _METHOD_ fusions were created to confirm the localization patterns observed with the promoter . interphase and dividing cells from roots and cotyledons of to d old seedlings were imaged . as observed in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ displayed identical localization patterns and accumulated in both the _LOCATION_ and the cytoplasm in interphase cells . in metaphase the _METHOD_ signal associated with the chromosomes . the _PROTEIN_ localization to the _PROTEIN_ was more pronounced in arabidopsis than in cells . the specific association of _PROTEIN_ with the chromosomes was also confirmed with the endogenous promoter in arabidopsis . notably the _PROTEIN_ level of the endogenous promoter driven _PROTEIN_ transcript was higher than that under the control of the promoter . similar to the observation in cells _PROTEIN_ was cytoplasmic in interphase cells and associated with chromosomes during cell division . interestingly in both and arabidopsis cells a _PROTEIN_ of brighter _METHOD_ was observed outside the _LOCATION_ prior to the division event corresponding to either the _LOCATION_ envelope or the prophase spindle . the localization of the _METHOD_ fusion protein was studied in arabidopsis plants upon overnight estradiol induction because plants transformed with the fusion under the control of the promoter yielded a very low _METHOD_ . as previously reported the _METHOD_ signal was detected exclusively in the _LOCATION_ of interphase cells where it associated with multiple _LOCATION_ speckles . during mitosis _METHOD_ associated with metaphase chromosomes and _PROTEIN_ the signal disappeared from the separating chromatids . in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ localized to the _LOCATION_ and displayed a dotted like pattern inside the _LOCATION_ whereas _PROTEIN_ was uniformly _LOCATION_ cytoplasmic and marked the _PROTEIN_ in agreement with the localization data . the chromosomal association of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ persisted in anaphase and the following stages whereas the _PROTEIN_ signal was detected on metaphase chromosomes . the chromosomal association of _PROTEIN_ was confirmed in an arabidopsis line _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion under the control of the endogenous promoter and displaying a significantly lower _PROTEIN_ transcript level when compared with the _PROTEIN_ overexpression line . the localization pattern of was _LOCATION_ and cytoplasmic in interphase cells and diffused to the cytoplasm upon _LOCATION_ envelope breakdown . _PROTEIN_ it weakly associated with the phragmoplast confirming the localization pattern in cells . in interphase cells of young cotyledons the cdka _METHOD_ signal was _LOCATION_ and cytoplasmic . in dividing cells the cdka signal associated with the _PROTEIN_ and in some cells it persisted through _PROTEIN_ stages of mitosis . in prophase cdka associated with condensing chromatin in the _LOCATION_ before the _LOCATION_ envelope broke down . afterward the protein localized to the mitotic spindle apparatus was excluded from the metaphase plate and associated with the midzone of the anaphase spindle . subsequently the protein clearly marked the early and expanding phragmoplast . identical localization patterns were observed when cdka fused to _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis under the control of its endogenous promoter . in arabidopsis the _PROTEIN_ protein localized to the _LOCATION_ and the cytoplasm . the punctate localization pattern although present was less pronounced than in cells . overall the protein localization in arabidopsis plants confirmed the patterns observed in cells . because several core cell cycle proteins displayed overlapping localization patterns we hypothesized that they might form functional complexes . thus all proteins associating with chromosomes and the _PROTEIN_ were tested for direct binary interactions among each other using the bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation assay in tobacco epidermal cells . the protein protein interaction networks indicated binary interactions among the chromosome associated proteins and seven binary interactions among the _PROTEIN_ localized proteins . although bifc failed to reveal a direct interaction between _PROTEIN_ and any of the _PROTEIN_ localized proteins _PROTEIN_ was included in the network because it had been detected previously in a complex with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ by immunoprecipitation experiments . because of its chromatin association cdka was tested for interaction with all chromosome associated proteins in bifc . interestingly the incorporation of cdka into the network increased the number of edges to indirectly supporting the presence of cdka on condensed chromosomes and suggesting that the localization of the cdk component in mitosis might depend on its interacting partners . to verify this hypothesis we analyzed arabidopsis plants stably _PROTEIN_ selected binary cdk complexes . arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ the c terminal fragment of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ fused to cdka were stably cotransformed with individual constructs containing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ proteins tagged with the n terminal fragment of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ formed a complex with cdka in the _LOCATION_ and in the cytoplasm . in metaphase cells the complex diffused to the cytoplasm and the spindle zone but did not associate with chromosomes . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interacted with cdka exclusively in the _LOCATION_ and showed characteristics of the krp dotted subnuclear localization pattern . interestingly in dividing root meristematic cells the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ complexes associated with metaphase chromosomes suggesting that the localization of cdka depended on the interacting partners .
the set of cell cycle genes was cloned into the gateway entry vector . the recombination reactions were done according to the manufacturer 's instructions . the _METHOD_ fusion constructs carried a kanamycin resistance gene whereas those with _METHOD_ were selectable on hygromycin . the driven _METHOD_ fusion constructs were generated in the destination vectors and for c terminal and n terminal fusions respectively . _METHOD_ fusions were constructed similarly except that _METHOD_ was substituted with _METHOD_ in the destination vector . the split _METHOD_ fusions were generated as described . binary vectors were introduced into agrobacterium tumefaciens strain by electroporation . arabidopsis plants were grown under long day conditions at on half strength murashige and skoog germination medium . plants were transformed by the floral dip method . transgenic plants were selected on kanamycin containing half strength murashige and skoog solid medium . the split _METHOD_ lines with _PROTEIN_ pairs of interacting proteins were created by supertransformation of cdka _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ lines with _METHOD_ tagged interactor constructs . stable tobacco transformation was carried out as described . several independently transformed calli were imaged for each construct . for colocalization studies a few calli of chosen constructs were selected . callus harboring the _METHOD_ tagged protein fusion was resuspended in the liquid medium and then supertransformed with other _METHOD_ tagged proteins . positive double transformants were selected on a medium enriched for hygromycin . fresh arabidopsis seedlings were ground . the rna was extracted with the rneasy kit . the rna concentration was adjusted and of total rna was used for cdna amplification . quantitative pcr was done with the following primer pair for _METHOD_ amplification gacaagcagaagaacggcatcaaggtga and cttgtacagctcgtccatgccgagagtg . _METHOD_ was analyzed with a confocal microscope both equipped with a water corrected objective to scan cells . dual _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was sequentially imaged in a multichannel setting with and nm light for _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ excitation respectively . emission _METHOD_ was captured in the frame scanning mode alternating _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ via a to nm bandpass emission filter and a nm cutoff filter respectively . images were recorded at to digital zoom . when no _METHOD_ _METHOD_ could be detected instability of the fusion protein or lack of _PROTEIN_ due to silencing or counterselection were assumed . _METHOD_ positive calli and arabidopsis seedlings were further analyzed . for live cell recordings samples were applied to a chambered cover glass and immobilized in a thin layer of of medium containing vitamins and low melting point agar . cells were monitored over the course of several hours and imaged every min . the following materials are available in the online version of this article . supplemental figure . distribution of the localization patterns among the arabidopsis core cell cycle proteins in interphase . supplemental figure . subcellular localization patterns of selected proteins _PROTEIN_ under the control of their endogenous promoters . supplemental table . overview of the arabidopsis core cell cycle proteins and their subcellular localization . supplemental table . literature search on the localization of plant core cell cycle proteins . supplemental table . protein protein interaction screen of the arabidopsis core cell cycle proteins by the bifc assay in tobacco epidermal cells .
