among the events that accompanied the evolution of chloroplasts from their endosymbiotic ancestors was the host cell recruitment of the prokaryotic cell division protein ftsz to function in chloroplast division . ftsz a structural homologue of tubulin mediates cell division in bacteria by assembling into a _PROTEIN_ at the midcell division site . in higher plants two _LOCATION_ encoded _METHOD_ of ftsz _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ play essential and functionally distinct roles in chloroplast division but whether this involves _PROTEIN_ formation at the division site has not been determined previously . using _METHOD_ microscopy and _PROTEIN_ of green _METHOD_ protein fusion proteins in arabidopsis thaliana we demonstrate here that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ localize to coaligned _PROTEIN_ at the chloroplast midpoint . antibodies specific for recognition of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ proteins in arabidopsis also recognize related polypeptides and detect midplastid _PROTEIN_ in pea and tobacco suggesting that midplastid _PROTEIN_ formation by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is universal among flowering plants . perturbation in the level of either protein in transgenic plants is accompanied by _LOCATION_ division defects and assembly of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ into filaments and filament networks not observed in wild type suggesting that previously described ftsz containing cytoskeletal like networks in chloroplasts may be artifacts of ftsz overexpression .
_METHOD_ microscopy was used to investigate the localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins in leaf sections from arabidopsis both in wild type plants and in the _LOCATION_ division mutant _PROTEIN_ . the division site is easily visualized in _PROTEIN_ because the chloroplasts are arrested in division and remain permanently constricted . affinity purified antipeptide antibodies generated against and both with high specificity for their target proteins on immunoblots were employed for these studies . in both wild type and _PROTEIN_ anti and anti antibodies each detected immunoreactive proteins that localized to the chloroplast midpoint . three dimensional reconstruction of images obtained from several focal planes revealed that both proteins were organized into clearly distinguishable smoothly curved _PROTEIN_ structures . these _PROTEIN_ appeared to be associated with the chloroplast periphery though their precise positions relative to the chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ and to each other could not be determined . localization of and to the _LOCATION_ midpoint was evident in most mesophyll cell chloroplasts and in both constricted and nonconstricted chloroplasts suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ remain assembled whether or not the chloroplasts are in the process of division . in deeply constricted chloroplasts and were also frequently detected in one or more thin filaments emanating from the central _PROTEIN_ . rotation of the three dimensional image projections of optical sections through these structures revealed that the filaments spiraled along the chloroplast periphery and suggested they could represent an intermediate stage in repositioning of the and containing _PROTEIN_ to the center of the newly formed daughter _LOCATION_ . control sections in which the anti atftsz antibodies were either omitted or substituted with preimmune serum did not show significant staining . to further confirm the in situ specificity of the anti and anti antibodies for their target proteins and to begin investigating the interdependence of and localization _METHOD_ labeling was performed on transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ or antisense transgenes that had been shown by immunoblotting to be depleted in the corresponding protein . these plants are severely impaired in _LOCATION_ division and contain single large chloroplasts in their mesophyll cells . the patterns of ftsz localization in the two sets of antisense plants were distinct from one another and from those in wild type . in the antisense plants _METHOD_ labeling of was not detected but could be detected in multiple filaments that did not show a specific pattern of localization . these filaments bent around the chloroplast periphery and in many cases were connected into _PROTEIN_ and spirals encircling the enlarged chloroplasts though these were often jagged rather than smoothly curved . in the antisense lines protein could not be detected by _METHOD_ staining but was detected largely in numerous short filaments and bright foci . because these structures were too short to trace in three dimensional reconstructions it could not be determined reliably whether they were associated with the chloroplast periphery the interior or both . some longer filaments were also observed in these plants and generally appeared as single discrete filaments unlike the disorganized filament networks seen in the antisense plants . the data shown in demonstrate that the antibody specificity observed on immunoblots is preserved during _METHOD_ staining and indicate that the _PROTEIN_ and filaments detected by the anti and anti antibodies represent distinct proteins . we conclude that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ both assemble into _PROTEIN_ at the site of chloroplast constriction in arabidopsis . in addition the _PROTEIN_ that containing filaments were observed in the antisense plants and vice versa further suggests that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins are not dependent on one another for their assembly into cytoskeletal like structures . the presence of ftsz containing _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ indicates that the _PROTEIN_ gene product acts after assembly of and into _PROTEIN_ structures and suggests that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins are both involved in the initiation of _LOCATION_ constriction . to determine whether the and _PROTEIN_ were colocalized we performed sequential double _METHOD_ labeling of leaf chloroplasts . this was necessary because both antibodies were raised in rabbits and therefore simultaneous double labeling was not feasible . when the digital images of the and localization patterns were superimposed the _METHOD_ signals were precisely overlaid . a series of control treatments in which one or both antibodies were omitted demonstrated that immunodetection of each protein was specific in tissue sections and cross talk between the and signals was minimal . the relative intensities of the two _METHOD_ signals were independent of the order of labeling indicating that elution of antibodies during the labeling procedure was not significant . we conclude from these data that the and containing _PROTEIN_ are coaligned . as a prelude to studying chloroplast ftsz localization dynamics in living tissue we constructed a gene encoding fused to _METHOD_ . a _PROTEIN_ terminal _METHOD_ fusion was used since contains an terminal transit peptide that is processed upon import to the chloroplast . because overexpression of driven by the strong cauliflower mosaic virus promoter inhibits chloroplast division the _METHOD_ transgene was _PROTEIN_ under control of a kb stretch of the native promoter in an effort to prevent overaccumulation of the fusion protein . transgenic plants were produced in both wild type and _PROTEIN_ backgrounds and fusion protein localization was investigated by in vivo _METHOD_ microscopy . although rna levels are generally quite low in wild type plants immunoblotting demonstrated that independent transgenic lines exhibited a wide range of _METHOD_ levels some of them very high despite use of the promoter . this suggests that additional regulatory elements outside the promoter fragment used in transgene construction may participate in regulating _PROTEIN_ of endogenous . most of the transgenic plants produced in the wild type background also exhibited defects in chloroplast division as indicated by the presence of reduced numbers of enlarged chloroplasts . in plants with relatively low levels of _METHOD_ the fusion protein could be clearly observed as a single _PROTEIN_ localized in the constricted neck of the chloroplasts and in nonconstricted chloroplasts . these plants exhibited reduced numbers of larger than normal chloroplasts when compared with wild type but constricted chloroplasts were seen frequently . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were also localized to a single _PROTEIN_ in constricted chloroplasts in the _PROTEIN_ background . in plants with high levels of _METHOD_ the fusion protein was detected in mesophyll cell chloroplasts in the form of many filaments that appeared to be randomly organized . these plants exhibited more severe defects in chloroplast division with of the mesophyll cells containing only a single giant chloroplast . in general the severity of the chloroplast division defect appeared to be correlated with the level of _METHOD_ accumulation and with the presence of _METHOD_ filament networks . a similar correlation between accumulation and _LOCATION_ division inhibition has been demonstrated previously in plants overexpressing an transgene under control of the camv promoter . among these overexpression lines _METHOD_ staining of sections from individuals with severe _LOCATION_ division defects and high levels revealed that is also detected in disorganized filament networks in these plants . _METHOD_ was often localized similarly in the _PROTEIN_ background but the inhibition of chloroplast division was only evident at highest _PROTEIN_ levels probably because _PROTEIN_ has a reduced number of enlarged chloroplasts to begin with . among the plants with high levels of _METHOD_ chloroplasts in epidermal cells were not as grossly enlarged as in mesophyll cells though many contained networks of _METHOD_ filaments . in the pavement cells of the epidermis _METHOD_ containing strands extended from these chloroplasts spanning long distances across the cell . these strands were often visible in bright field images as well . in the guard cells of stomata individual chloroplasts often seemed to be interconnected by the _METHOD_ strands . these observation indicate that _METHOD_ accumulates in thin connections between the chloroplast which probably represent stromules described previously by . could be detected in similar structures by _METHOD_ microscopy in overexpression lines but not in wild type plants . overall the behavior of the _METHOD_ fusion protein paralleled that of the native protein both with respect to its localization patterns and with _PROTEIN_ to its dosage dependent impact on _LOCATION_ division . we conclude that the _METHOD_ fusion protein accurately reflects the activity of in vivo . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins assemble into _PROTEIN_ in plants other than arabidopsis the anti and anti antibodies were used to detect cross reactive proteins in pea and tobacco . on immunoblots of leaf extracts each antibody recognized polypeptides that migrated close to those in arabidopsis . _METHOD_ staining revealed cross reactive proteins localized to _PROTEIN_ at the constriction of dividing chloroplasts in both pea and tobacco . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins assemble into _PROTEIN_ structures and most likely have similar functions in _LOCATION_ division in all flowering plants .
