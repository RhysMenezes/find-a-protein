the amino acid sequence of _PROTEIN_ is similar to other ascorbate peroxidases a group of proteins that protect plants from oxidative damage by transferring electrons from ascorbate to detoxify peroxides . in this study we characterized two _PROTEIN_ mutant alleles . translational fusions with _METHOD_ indicated _PROTEIN_ localizes to chloroplasts . both _PROTEIN_ mutant alleles formed chlorotic cotyledons with significantly reduced chlorophyll a chlorophyll b and lutein . given the homology of apx to ros scavenging proteins this result is consistent with _PROTEIN_ protecting seedling _METHOD_ from oxidation . the growth of _PROTEIN_ seedlings was stunted early in seedling development . in addition _PROTEIN_ altered seed quality by affecting seed coat formation . while _PROTEIN_ seed development appeared normal the seed coat was darker and more permeable than the wild type . in addition accelerated aging tests showed that _PROTEIN_ seeds were more sensitive to environmental stress than the wild type seeds . if _PROTEIN_ affects seed pigment biosynthesis or reduction the seed coat color and permeability phenotypes are explained . _PROTEIN_ mutants had cotyledon chlorosis increased accumulation and reduced soluble apx activity in seedlings . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is involved in the ros scavenging process in chloroplasts .
chlorotic cotyledons were found in two different _PROTEIN_ mutant alleles designated as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ mutant has a t dna insertion in the sixth intron and the _PROTEIN_ mutant has a t dna insertion in the last exon . in both _PROTEIN_ alleles the chlorotic cotyledon phenotype was incompletely penetrant or had variable _PROTEIN_ . this phenotype was observed in and of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings respectively . seedlings with severely chlorotic cotyledons often died when sown in soil but they survived when grown on gm plates containing sucrose . this indicates that _PROTEIN_ seedlings acquired nutrients from the media that they were unable to synthesize in sufficient amounts when grown on soil . two findings show that the chlorosis phenotype was caused by mutation of the _PROTEIN_ locus . first the heteroallelic _PROTEIN_ plants displayed a chlorotic cotyledon phenotype which was indistinguishable from the parental phenotype . this eliminates the possibility that a second site mutation caused the phenotype . secondly introducing an intact _PROTEIN_ gene into the _PROTEIN_ mutant background complemented the chlorotic cotyledon phenotype . this indicates that the genomic fragment containing _PROTEIN_ was sufficient to compensate for the mutated _PROTEIN_ locus and eliminate the cotyledon phenotype . seedlings of _PROTEIN_ mutants were separated into two groups green cotyledons and chlorotic cotyledons and their pigments were extracted . data revealed that chlorophyll a chlorophyll b and lutein contents in both _PROTEIN_ mutant alleles with chlorotic cotyledons were significantly reduced . surprisingly _PROTEIN_ seedlings without apparent chlorotic cotyledons had significantly less chlorophyll and lutein than the wild type . the _PROTEIN_ seedlings with green cotyledons had lower but not significantly different levels . the data revealed that cotyledon chlorosis occurred in both groups of seedlings which shows that the _PROTEIN_ mutants exhibited variable _PROTEIN_ and not poor penetrance . because the _METHOD_ of a single arabidopsis seedling is difficult to measure accurately seedling growth was evaluated by measuring leaf area and root length . seedlings were grown on gm plates that were oriented vertically so the roots would grow across the surface . in day old seedlings the root lengths and leaf area of both _PROTEIN_ alleles were significantly lower than controls . the seed color of _PROTEIN_ mutants was darker than wild type seeds . because changes in seed coat color are associated with other seed property modifications seed quality and seed vigor were evaluated in _PROTEIN_ alleles . only of the _PROTEIN_ seeds germinated after sterilization in hypochlorite but this germination behavior was maternally controlled indicating this phenotype was determined by seed coat properties . when hypochlorite was used for sterilization freshly harvested wild type seeds completely germinated in days whereas _PROTEIN_ seeds did this in days . germination rates of _PROTEIN_ significantly _PROTEIN_ after accelerated aging as well as natural aging . these results indicate _PROTEIN_ seeds were less tolerant of harsh environmental conditions probably due to changes in the _PROTEIN_ seed coat . in order to determine whether _PROTEIN_ mutant seeds were viable wild type and mutant seeds were evaluated to determine if they could oxidize tetrazolium chloride . once tetrazolium penetrates the seed coat a metabolically active embryo oxidizes this colorless dye forming a red pigment . normally tetrazolium can not penetrate the arabidopsis seed coat so seeds need to be perforated to carry out this test . results showed that _PROTEIN_ seeds are metabolically active but the seed coat of _PROTEIN_ mutant alleles was more permeable than the wild type since tetrazolium penetrated the seed without perforation . as revealed by in situ hybridization _PROTEIN_ transcripts were found in leaf mesophyll and phloem . _PROTEIN_ staining indicated that the _PROTEIN_ promoter is most active in the cotyledons and first true leaf . these results correlate nicely with the posted _PROTEIN_ of this gene . in reproductive organs _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in sepals and the abscission area at the base of sepals . examination of the dissected edge of the carpel wall revealed intense _PROTEIN_ gus staining indicating that wounding induced the _PROTEIN_ of this gene . according to rt pcr results _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in many tissues throughout the aboveground plant but not in roots . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ translational fusion protein localized to the chloroplasts . the chloroplasts in guard cells have a stronger _METHOD_ signal than chloroplasts in mesophyll cells . although _PROTEIN_ has a skl motif at its c terminal and was predicted to be present in _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ our _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ translational fusion proteins did not co localize with the dsred _PROTEIN_ marker protein which is targeted to _LOCATION_ . this _METHOD_ localization corroborates previous biochemical data showing that _PROTEIN_ is present in the chloroplast lumen . according to the rt pcr results no full length _PROTEIN_ transcripts were found in either _PROTEIN_ mutant alleles . two other reverse primers and amplified partial _PROTEIN_ cdna products . _PROTEIN_ fragment a amplified with and primers was present in wild type arabidopsis but not in the two _PROTEIN_ mutants . the truncated _PROTEIN_ cdna fragment b amplified with and was found in both _PROTEIN_ alleles but the amount was greatly reduced in _PROTEIN_ seedlings . if the truncated _PROTEIN_ transcripts were to be stably translated the truncated protein would only contain a third of the amino acid sequence of a mature _PROTEIN_ protein . while the _PROTEIN_ allele is predicted to encode nearly the entire coding sequence of this gene the t dna insert disrupted stable transcript accumulation for this allele . data indicate that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are null alleles . to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ is involved in the ros scavenging metabolism levels and soluble apx activity in wild type plants and _PROTEIN_ mutants were measured . we observed large accumulation in day old _PROTEIN_ seedlings which were higher than the baseline levels in wild type plants . zymographs were used to visualize active apx complexes on native polyacrylamide gels . no detergent was used on these extracts so _LOCATION_ embedded apx likely were not extracted . examination of rubisco extraction efficiency with and without detergent reveals that soluble proteins in organelles were efficiently extracted . in the zymograph the prominent signal consisted of a doublet of bands while four minor bands displayed differing migration rates . in _PROTEIN_ alleles two bands showed diminished intensity when compared to controls . the kinetic assay measured apx activity by the consumption of ascorbate in an apx dependent fashion confirming that the _PROTEIN_ of soluble apx activity in _PROTEIN_ alleles were significant .
