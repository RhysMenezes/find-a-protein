the spontaneous and deleterious conversion of l asparaginyl and l aspartyl protein residues to l iso asp or d asp occurs as proteins age and is accelerated under stressful conditions . arabidopsis contains two genes encoding protein l isoaspartate methyltransferase _PROTEIN_ an enzyme capable of correcting this damage . the gene located on chromosome _PROTEIN_ produces two proteins differing by three amino acids through alternative splice site selection in the first intron . recombinant protein from both splicing variants has _PROTEIN_ activity . subcellular localization using cell fractionation followed by immunoblot detection as well as confocal visualization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ is _LOCATION_ while a canonical _LOCATION_ localization signal present in _PROTEIN_ and the shorter _PROTEIN_ is functional . multiplex reverse transcription pcr was used to establish _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcript presence and abundance relative to tubulin in various tissues and under a variety of stresses imposed on seeds and seedlings . _PROTEIN_ transcript is constitutively present but can increase along with _PROTEIN_ in developing seeds presumably in response to increasing endogenous abscisic acid . transcript from _PROTEIN_ also increases in establishing seedlings due to exogenous aba and applied stress presumably through an aba dependent pathway . furthermore cleaved amplified polymorphic sequences from _PROTEIN_ amplicons determined that aba preferentially enhances the production of _PROTEIN_ transcript in leaves and possibly in tissues other than germinating seeds .
we identified a gene on chromosome that is highly similar to the previously identified _PROTEIN_ gene on chromosome encoding a protein repair methyltransferase . two full length mrna sequences of the chromosome _PROTEIN_ gene differing by only a nucleotide alternatively spliced segment were assembled from reverse transcription pcr amplicons and and _PROTEIN_ products . these transcripts possess a bp untranslated region a _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ bp coding region and a bp utr . these results reveal that the splicing pattern predicted for _GENE_ is incorrect . specifically the splice site in the first intron was predicted incorrectly a large portion of exon was excluded and a fragment of intron was included . the two transcripts recovered in a _PROTEIN_ specific for capped mrna terminated at the same site supporting transcriptional initiation at this site . the splicing scheme presented is consistent with previously identified _PROTEIN_ sequence tags which lack some residues at the and ends _PROTEIN_ . the bp difference in the coding region is a result of alternative site selection in the first intron . alternative splicing was verified by the production of two amplicons from rt pcr reactions using primers and . additionally the longer splicing variant encodes an extra endonuclease restriction site that enabled distinction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ following rt pcr using cleaved amplified polymorphic sequences . a putative polyadenylation signal _PROTEIN_ was detected in the utr of _PROTEIN_ transcripts . a plant cis acting regulatory dna elements signal scan search identified a putative aba response element _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ promoter ending nts from the transcriptional start site . comparison of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ nucleotide sequences revealed that both contained three introns . the introns are situated between the same nucleotides in both genes _PROTEIN_ . when the coding regions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are compared it is clear that the most bp of _PROTEIN_ are unique . excluding this region nucleotide identity over the bp coding region shared with _PROTEIN_ is . the unique bp portion of _PROTEIN_ encodes a amino acid n terminal sequence in which both ipsort and predictprotein _METHOD_ identified a _LOCATION_ localization signal . excluding the amino terminal extension _PROTEIN_ is identical similar to _PROTEIN_ and identical similar to wheat isoaspartyl methyltransferase . all three of these methyltransferase sequences are most identical in the _PROTEIN_ regions i ii and iii proposed to be involved in binding s adomet . two additional regions pre i and post iii proposed to be unique to _PROTEIN_ and possibly important in determining substrate specificity are also present in _PROTEIN_ . protein extracts of flowers seeds or vegetative organs that had or had not undergone abiotic stress were assayed for _PROTEIN_ activity and the presence of _PROTEIN_ protein using affinity purified antibodies . enzyme activity was detectable from protein extracts from mature seeds the sole plant tissue tested where western blots also detected immunoreactive bands . cell fractionation of seed tissue followed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and western blot localized _PROTEIN_ to the cytoplasm and _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ fraction . the largest immunoreactive band detected using _PROTEIN_ specific antibody is comparable in size to that of untagged recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein produced from the first in frame translational start site in the _PROTEIN_ cdna adding credence to the transcriptional start site identified using _PROTEIN_ though the smaller band discernable in the _PROTEIN_ western was too small to be _PROTEIN_ . to directly test the subcellular localization of the different _PROTEIN_ the coding regions of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ were cloned behind the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter contiguous at the end with the coding region for the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . these constructs were then biolistically introduced into onion epidermal cells a model plant cell amenable for live imaging of the _METHOD_ . the _METHOD_ when _PROTEIN_ without an amino terminal fusion was distributed throughout the cytoplasm but was also able to traverse the _LOCATION_ pore complex . _METHOD_ was again detectable in both the cytoplasm and the _LOCATION_ for _PROTEIN_ terminal fusions of _METHOD_ with _PROTEIN_ and with altered _PROTEIN_ proteins with either two or four of the five lys comprising the presumptive nls substituted . with the nls intact _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions were efficiently sequestered in the _LOCATION_ . all recombinant proteins were produced in escherichia coli originally from with or without a _PROTEIN_ terminal hexahistidyl tag and three linking amino acids _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . because the _PROTEIN_ enzymes were insoluble _PROTEIN_ splicing variants were also _PROTEIN_ from as n utilization substance fusion proteins including an amino terminal amino acid linker . the exact cloning sites used in each instance are provided in materials and methods. _PROTEIN_ fortuitously retained the initiating met when _PROTEIN_ in e. coli . proteins were purified by ni affinity chromatography and the affinity purified enzyme preparations assessed for an l isoaspartyl methyltransferase activity using val tyr pro l isoasp his ala as a methyl accepting peptide . _PROTEIN_ and both nus _PROTEIN_ proteins with or without thrombin mediated removal of the nus fusion had an l isoaspartyl methyltransferase activity confirming the initial identification based on nucleotide and deduced amino acid homology . the nus _PROTEIN_ and nus _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins exhibited specific activities of and pmol mg respectively while the nus protein alone had no activity . additionally _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ purified as inclusion bodies exhibited an isoaspartyl methyltransferase activity when solubilized in m urea and used in the assay . this relatively rare ability among enzymes to retain activity even in the presence of urea has been documented previously as being a characteristic of _PROTEIN_ . using multiplex rt pcr it was possible to detect and distinguish _PROTEIN_ from _PROTEIN_ relate both _PROTEIN_ transcript amounts to that of tubulin and using caps discriminate between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and determine their relative abundance . results obtained using multiplex rt pcr were verified by performing all amplifications two or more times . when the relative abundance of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ varied due to treatment or tissue results were assessed two or more times using caps or by separating amplicons using metaphor agarose or _PROTEIN_ . in these instances _PROTEIN_ transcript abundance is reported as an average of two or more assays with the se of the mean . rna was extracted twice from stressed or unstressed seedlings grown on two separate occasions and used to assess transcript abundance and splicing variation independently . excluding results for the stem in no instance was the se greater than of the mean _PROTEIN_ percent relative to the total _PROTEIN_ transcript amount . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts were less abundant than tubulin transcripts . _PROTEIN_ appeared constitutively _PROTEIN_ in all tissues tested . _PROTEIN_ transcript if detectable was in less abundance than _PROTEIN_ as evident by the appearance of _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ product after cycles . _PROTEIN_ was usually undetectable in roots although faint product was apparent after cycles in one experiment . _PROTEIN_ was present in _METHOD_ and flowers and was in somewhat greater abundance in leaves . the production of _PROTEIN_ was consistently favored over that of _PROTEIN_ in these tissues except for the stem . while the amount of total _PROTEIN_ transcript detected in the stem by multiplex rt pcr was consistent analysis of splicing variant amounts in stem tissue was highly variable . the most extreme percentages of _PROTEIN_ relative to total _PROTEIN_ transcript measured are provided . _PROTEIN_ was present in siliques and seeds increased in abundance at least from to d after pollination and remained high up to at least dap . amplicon intensity following ethidium bromide staining quantified _PROTEIN_ in siliques and seeds at dap as and in mature dehydrated seeds as of tubulin amplicon intensity . amounts of _PROTEIN_ transcript in mature dehydrated seeds was similar to that in whole siliques at dap . _PROTEIN_ transcript was undetectable in flowers to dap . its abundance increased and then declined by dap . the increase in abundance of _PROTEIN_ to dap was almost entirely due to the production of _PROTEIN_ but the situation was reversed by to dap and from onward to dap with _PROTEIN_ comprising the bulk of the transcripts . between and dap _PROTEIN_ was in greater abundance . _PROTEIN_ activity and immunoreactive protein were detected only in extracts from mature seeds prompting an analysis of _PROTEIN_ transcript abundance during seed germination on water on abscisic acid and under continuous far red illumination and h after imbibition . the general trend normalizing for tubulin among the different lanes at cycles was for transcripts from _PROTEIN_ to remain more or less in constant abundance . on water under _METHOD_ lights _PROTEIN_ mrna declined following imbibition until hai at which time _PROTEIN_ transcript abundance increased . the decline of _PROTEIN_ transcript during the first hai observed for seeds on water under _METHOD_ light was delayed by exposure to constant far red light and mitigated by aba . additionally the accumulation hai observed when seeds were imbibed on water or aba under _METHOD_ lights was absent when illuminated by far red light . the _PROTEIN_ splicing variant tended to be in greater abundance and hai _PROTEIN_ of treatment . however within an imbibition time there were no striking differences in _PROTEIN_ abundance among treatments . in _PROTEIN_ when the splicing variant estimates among treatments were used as replications to obtain an average _PROTEIN_ percentage for each hai examined the greatest se of the estimate encountered was only of the average . promoter analysis of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ identified an _PROTEIN_ . to determine if the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ gene was responsive to aba as well as to salt and drought stress seedlings were exposed d after imbibition to different stress treatments and transcript abundance analyzed . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was more or less similar _PROTEIN_ of stress . in contrast _PROTEIN_ transcript abundance increased due to aba drought or salt stress . methyltransferase activity assays and western blot of control and stressed seedlings detected neither _PROTEIN_ activity nor immunoreactive protein . the increase in _PROTEIN_ transcript abundance by aba is accompanied by the predominant production of _PROTEIN_ relative to _PROTEIN_ .
using the amino acid sequence of _PROTEIN_ as query in a tblastn search a second gene was identified in the arabidopsis genome _PROTEIN_ putatively encoding a protein l isoapartyl methyltransferase . rt pcr of mature leaf total rna using gene specific primers to the predicted coding region was used to amplify a _PROTEIN_ cdna . the full length cdna of _PROTEIN_ was delineated using _PROTEIN_ and a _PROTEIN_ strategy designed to amplify capped mrna specifically . amplicons from the latter experiment determined that two transcripts were produced from the _PROTEIN_ gene through alternative splice site selection . these were designated as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . all coding regions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with or without the stop codon were cloned into the ncoi xhoi sites of . for _PROTEIN_ a ncoi and xhoi site was introduced into the coding region by pcr . the second codon of _PROTEIN_ commenced with a guanine the same nucleotide terminating the ncoi site which _PROTEIN_ the amino terminal _PROTEIN_ amino acid sequence . both _PROTEIN_ coding regions were altered by pcr to introduce a bsphi site and sali site . these enzymes cleave to leave ncoi or xhoi ligation compatible overhangs respectively . the modification retained the adenine in position one of the second _PROTEIN_ codon and the modification avoided an internal xhoi site in the _PROTEIN_ coding region . no _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ protein produced from was soluble . this problem was overcome by cloning the coding regions including stop codons into the xmai xhoi sites of by introducing bspei sali sites into the _PROTEIN_ and termini respectively . for all constructs recombinant protein production was induced in the escherichia coli strain ril growing at in ml of luria bertani media containing appropriate selection once the reached . upon induction with mm isopropylthio galactoside the culture was shifted to and grown for an additional h. bacterial cells were pelleted resuspended in volume of lysis buffer and lysed with two passages through a french press at pounds square . the lysate was centrifuged at for min at . the supernatant was collected the presence of soluble recombinant protein confirmed on aliquots using _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and recombinant proteins loaded onto and eluted from nickel charged affinity columns using an _METHOD_ to wash the column and elute the protein with an imidazol gradient in lysis buffer . sixteen microliter aliquots from the ml fractions were run on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to determine those fractions containing recombinant protein and the purest fractions pooled and dialysed overnight against hepes buffer to remove the imidazol . these fractions were then used in _PROTEIN_ assays before and following cleavage of the nus fusion from the native _PROTEIN_ using thrombin h at . additionally insoluble inclusion bodies of _PROTEIN_ protein generated from the plasmid in e. coli were purified by washing according to the manufacturers instructions and resolubilized in freshly prepared m urea . an aliquot of the resolubilized protein was used in a _PROTEIN_ assay . the _PROTEIN_ assay was a vapor diffusion assay performed on recombinant proteins as described in citation . _PROTEIN_ recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were subjected to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and transferred to immobilon psq _LOCATION_ . blotted protein was subjected to automated edman degradative sequencing _METHOD_ using the facilities at the university of kentucky macromolecular structure analysis facility . in both cases the first five amino acids corresponded to those predicted for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the purified proteins were used as antigen for production of polyclonal antibodies . antibodies were affinity purified and tested against both recombinant _PROTEIN_ substrates for specificity and titred using known amounts of purified recombinant protein to determine sensitivity . in all instances protein concentration of enzyme assays extracts and lysates was determined using pierce _METHOD_ blue plus reagent . arabidopsis seeds were cold treated on moist germination blotter in a petri dish at for d prior to being transferred to in a germinator with continuous _METHOD_ light . seven days after transfer to seedlings were transferred to soil and grown to maturity in a growth chamber at with h _METHOD_ light . three weeks after sowing on soil wild type ws plants were harvested the soil removed from the roots and the plants divided into roots stem flowers cauline and rosette leaves . tissue was bulked and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to being stored at until extracted for rna . opening flowers of wild type ws plants grown in the growth chamber were tagged every d and upon the siliques from the earliest tagged flowers turning brown all tagged siliques in the following developmental intervals were harvested to d to d to d to d to d to d to d and mature dehydrated seeds . the siliques were stored in microcentrifuge tubes on dry ice while harvesting followed by flash freezing in liquid nitrogen and storage at until rna extraction . dehydrated seeds were stored at . wild type ws seeds were surface sterilized the seeds washed at least five times with sterile water and resuspended in sterile agarose . seed suspensions were plated on sterile germination paper saturated with murashige and skoog medium and situated on solid media . the seeds were germinated at for d and then under continuous light at . after d of growth at seedling populations were subjected to stress treatments . the filter paper supporting the seedlings was transferred to a petri dish with two layers of dry sterilized germination blotter on the bottom to impose drought stress for h ml of mm nacl solution for h trans aba in deionized water for h and as a control seedlings were transferred to dishes containing ml of deionized water for h. following stress the seedlings were harvested immediately and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen before being stored at until rna extraction . this experiment was performed on two separate occasions . approximately mg wild type ws seeds were imbibed on two layers of germination blotter moistened with ml water under continuous white or far red light or imbibed on ml of cis trans aba in deionized water under continuous white light at for and h. at each time point a petri dish containing imbibed seeds under each of the three conditions was removed from treatment and the seeds within harvested immediately and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen before being stored at until rna extraction . total rna was isolated from roots _METHOD_ flowers cauline and rosette leaves using a kit and from unstressed and stressed seedlings using trizol reagent according to the respective manufacturer 's instructions . total rna was isolated from developing siliques using a method modified from the rneasy plant kit and from dry or germinating seeds using a hot borate technique . total rna isolated from the aboveground parts of arabidopsis from plants grown under normal conditions was pretreated with dnase i using a kit according to the manufacturer . for _PROTEIN_ the first strand cdna was synthesized using an oligo anchor primer with a nonhomologous extension and _PROTEIN_ iii according to the manufacturer 's directions . _PROTEIN_ procedures designed to amplify only capped mrna were performed on of dnase i treated leaf total rna using gene specific primers and a kit according to the instructions of the manufacturer . pcr was performed on of first strand cdna using gene specific primers in conjunction with primers designed to the nonhomologous extension on the _PROTEIN_ anchor primer or the reverse transcribed rna _PROTEIN_ ligated to the end of full length rna in _PROTEIN_ . amplicons were isolated from agarose gels following electrophoresis cloned into a t/a vector and sequenced . sequencing was performed at the advanced genetics technologies center using a beckman coulter ceq capillary electrophoresis genetic analysis system to read cycle sequencing reactions employing a combination of universal and gene specific primers . sequences were viewed and assembled using sequencer software . gene and cdna sequences were analyzed using place ipsort and predictprotein _METHOD_ . arabidopsis _LOCATION_ were isolated according to citation . _LOCATION_ proteins for immunoblot analysis were isolated according to procedures from citation . up to of _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ protein were suspended in laemmli 's buffer boiled and electrophoresed on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gels . protein was transferred to pvdf _LOCATION_ using semi dry transfer . blots were incubated in tris buffered saline plus tween containing bovine serum albumin and washed in ml of tbst . blots were _PROTEIN_ with a fold dilution of affinity purified primary antibody in ml of tbst bovine serum albumin . the _LOCATION_ was washed incubated in ml of deionizied water reconstituted milk powder and fold diluted goat anti rabbit peroxidase conjugate followed by min washes with tbst . the _LOCATION_ was incubated with chemiluminescent substrates for min and bands visualized using x ray film . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ coding sequences were cloned down stream from the camv promoter in frame with a situated _METHOD_ reporter in the binary vector . as a negative control the presumptive nls of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion was altered through successive rounds of site directed mutagenesis . transient _METHOD_ assays were conducted by introducing ng plasmid dna coated onto diameter gold microcarriers into onion epidermal cells using a _PROTEIN_ dupont/bio rad microprojectile delivery system . epidermal peels were cultured for h on media and of chloromethyl snarf acetate used as a counter stain spread on the bombarded area min prior to observation . the peels were mounted on slides and viewed using a leica tcs laser confocal imaging microscope _METHOD_ with a numerical aperture of and a working distance of to . all rna was pretreated with dnase i . the first strand cdna for rt pcr analysis was synthesized with oligo primers using of total rna and _PROTEIN_ iii at for h. the reaction was terminated and treated with rnase cocktail . the alternative splice site selection identified during _PROTEIN_ was verified by size fractionating amplicons produced using primers and in metaphor agarose or nondenaturing poly acrylamide gels . in both instances resolved gels were stained with sybr gold visualized and the image captured . due to the size similarity of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts and their low abundance qualitative rt pcr was used to determine the presence of _PROTEIN_ and compare it to transcript abundance from _PROTEIN_ . forward and reverse primers amplifying a bp fragment of _PROTEIN_ or a bp fragment of _PROTEIN_ were tested with or without primers amplifying a bp fragment of tubulin . following ethidium bromide staining the amplicons from multiplex pcr reactions at and cycles were analyzed for so called interference i.e . any _PROTEIN_ in intensity relative to reactions amplifying a single template at the same number of cycles . there was no interference of _PROTEIN_ and tubulin primers or templates and both amplicons increased in intensity in successive rounds of pcr beyond those at which aliquots were taken and used to quantify amplicon intensity . however no primer combination or input cdna amount avoided interference between tubulin and _PROTEIN_ in a multiplex pcr . _PROTEIN_ tubulin primer input avoided interference but tubulin amplicon accumulation plateaued prior to _PROTEIN_ amplicon becoming quantifiable . _PROTEIN_ and tubulin were therefore amplified in separate tubes at primer concentrations sufficient to _PROTEIN_ exponential accumulation of both amplicons beyond cycles . however even at the greater tubulin primer concentration _PROTEIN_ at cycles was not in sufficient abundance to be quantifiable prior to tubulin amplification plateauing at cycles . amplicon amounts were therefore not quantified and a multiplex pcr analysis was conducted with _PROTEIN_ tubulin primer concentrations for both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . tubulin amounts in the multiplex were visualized at cycles while amplicon accumulation was still in the logarithmic phase and _PROTEIN_ was visualized at cycles along with tubulin which had plateaued before this point . following _PROTEIN_ amplification bands were removed from the gel using a kit reamplified and cleaved at for at least h with iii . the caps resulted in two visible bands when electrophoresed in a agarose gel a larger amplicon _PROTEIN_ and two colocalized fragments _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were run with each experiment . tif files of photographs of amplicons or caps were quantified using the electrophoresis gel analysis module of imagequant tl . the ratio of the band intensity of total uncleaved _PROTEIN_ amplicon _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was compared to that of comigrating bands _PROTEIN_ from identical aliquots exhaustively digested with iii . upon request all novel materials described in this
