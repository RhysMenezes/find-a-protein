_LOCATION_ h _PROTEIN_ a _LOCATION_ bound proton translocating pyrophosphatase found in various species including plants some protozoan and prokaryotes has been demonstrated to be localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in plants . using a gus reporter system and a green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion protein we investigated the tissue distribution and the subcellular localization respectively of a novel type h _PROTEIN_ encoded by _PROTEIN_ identified in the arabidopsis thaliana genome . we showed that _PROTEIN_ is highly _PROTEIN_ at the trichome and the filament of stamen . furthermore the _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ showed small dot like structures that were observed throughout the cytoplasm of various arabidopsis cells under a _METHOD_ microscope . the distribution of this dot like _METHOD_ pattern was apparently affected by a treatment with brefeldin a . moreover we demonstrated that most dot like _METHOD_ structures colocalized with a _LOCATION_ resident protein . these findings suggest that this novel type h _PROTEIN_ resides on the _LOCATION_ apparatus rather than the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ .
we investigated the tissue distribution of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by using a promoter gus reporter system . approximately kb and kb upstream regions of the _PROTEIN_ gene were transcriptionally fused to the gus reporter gene and these reporter constructs were stably introduced into a. thaliana . no obvious staining differences were observed between kb and kb promoter reporter constructs . in young seedlings cotyledons and roots were more strongly stained than young rosette leaves . in rosette leaves trichomes were extensively stained . trichome is a huge single cell that is highly vacuolated . in flowers sepals and stamen filaments were strongly stained although the anther was hardly stained . stamen filaments develop rapidly with cell enlargement at the final stage of floral development . this staining pattern suggested that the _PROTEIN_ of type ii h _PROTEIN_ is up regulated during cell expansion . the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ was different from that of _PROTEIN_ especially in anther . _PROTEIN_ is strongly _PROTEIN_ in pollen but is not _PROTEIN_ in stamen filaments . to examine the subcellular localization of type ii h _PROTEIN_ we _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ tagged type ii h _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis suspension cultured cells and in transgenic plants . _METHOD_ was fused to the n terminus _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or c terminus _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ of type ii h _PROTEIN_ . in the cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ bright clear small dot like _METHOD_ structures were observed throughout the cytoplasm under a _METHOD_ microscope . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ also produced the same _METHOD_ pattern but with much lower _METHOD_ intensity than _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . thereafter we decided to use _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ for the following experiment . although we can not rule out the possibility that the type ii h _PROTEIN_ is localized to the dot like structures due to an influence of _METHOD_ fusion the identical _METHOD_ pattern of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ suggests that the localization of both fusion proteins reflects that of the authentic protein . in the transient _PROTEIN_ condition occasionally _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in the _LOCATION_ lumen . this inside _LOCATION_ staining pattern implies that the _LOCATION_ is the final destination of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in a transient condition and we merely observed the transition to the final destination . however the same _METHOD_ dot like structures were observed in the transgenic plant carrying _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ suggesting that this dot like _METHOD_ pattern indicates the precise localization of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ not dependent on the _PROTEIN_ condition . at a higher magnification some doughnut shaped or horseshoe shaped structures were observed in part of the dot like _METHOD_ spots . furthermore some of these dot like _METHOD_ organelles were wiggling or moving along cytoplasmic streaming . these features are unique characteristics of the plant ga . however in plant cells there are some other dot like organelles such as mitochondria chloroplast and _LOCATION_ visualized by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of the localized proteins . to rule out the possibility that the _METHOD_ tagged type ii h _PROTEIN_ is localized to these organelles we compared the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ with some _METHOD_ markers of these organelles . as shown in there is no merged _METHOD_ of the _METHOD_ and mito tracker which is a _METHOD_ dye that selectively stains mitochondria . furthermore to investigate the chloroplast localization of the protein we also performed a transient analysis in protoplasts of mesophyll cells isolated from rosette leaves since suspension cultured cells have no mature chloroplasts . as in the suspension cultured cell dot like _METHOD_ patterns were observed throughout the cytoplasm and never merged with chlorophyll _METHOD_ . we investigated the effect of bfa treatment on the localization of the _METHOD_ tagged type ii h _PROTEIN_ . bfa is a fungal antibiotic that specifically blocks the anterograde protein transport from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to the ga and results in redistribution of _LOCATION_ resident proteins into the _LOCATION_ . in plant cells this reagent also affects ga structure and the distribution of _LOCATION_ resident proteins although some differences from mammalian cells were observed . we followed the morphological change of the _METHOD_ pattern of _METHOD_ tagged type ii h _PROTEIN_ after the addition of bfa . after h incubation at a concentration of bfa the dot like _METHOD_ structures disappeared and some aggregated structures and/or network like structure emerged in most cells . the oval shaped structure seemed to be the bfa compartment reported previously . although we did not determine whether the network like structure is _LOCATION_ or not it is apparent that the distribution of dot like _METHOD_ organelle is affected by bfa treatment . these data indicate that dot like _METHOD_ organelle is apparently bfa sensitive suggesting that the dot like _METHOD_ structure is a ga. we probed the arabidopsis ga with anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies raised against the trans _LOCATION_ localized reversibly glycosylated polypeptide _PROTEIN_ of pea because pea and arabidopsis have a similar amino acid sequence of _PROTEIN_ . in suspension cultured cells transiently _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ the most _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was merged with the _METHOD_ marked by the _PROTEIN_ antibody . this strongly indicates that the dot like _METHOD_ organelle is the ga . therefore we conclude that type ii h _PROTEIN_ is localized to the ga . indeed the existence of h _PROTEIN_ in ga has been demonstrated by measuring the _PROTEIN_ dependent proton pumping activity and by detecting immunologically . v type h _PROTEIN_ is actually distributed to the plant ga _LOCATION_ . matsuoka et al . reported that the acidic environment generated by _LOCATION_ resident v _PROTEIN_ is important for the sorting of soluble _LOCATION_ proteins . it is likely that the type ii h _PROTEIN_ functions as an h pump of ga in combination with ga resident v _PROTEIN_ for generating the acidic environment . the signals responsible for the subcellular localization of both h _PROTEIN_ remain to be identified . the _METHOD_ tagged type ii h _PROTEIN_ may be a useful tool for investigating the _LOCATION_ retention mechanism of multi transmembrane protein in plant cell .
