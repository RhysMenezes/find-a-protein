plant rops _PROTEIN_ are soluble ras related small _PROTEIN_ that are attached to cell _LOCATION_ by virtue of the post translational lipid modifications of prenylation and s acylation . rops _PROTEIN_ are subdivided into two major subgroups called type i and type ii . whereas type i rops terminate with a conserved caal box and undergo prenylation type ii rops undergo s acylation on two or three c terminal cysteines . in the present work we determined the sequence requirement for association of arabidopsis type ii rops with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . we identified a conserved sequence motif designated the gc cg box in which the modified cysteines are flanked by glycines . the gc cg box cysteines are separated by five to six mostly non _PROTEIN_ residues . deletion of this sequence or the introduction of mutations that change its nature disrupted the association of rops with the _LOCATION_ . mutations that changed the gc cg box glycines to alanines also interfered with _LOCATION_ association . deletion of a polybasic domain proximal to the gc cg box disrupted the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ association of _PROTEIN_ . a green _METHOD_ protein fusion protein containing the c terminal residues of _PROTEIN_ including its polybasic domain and gc cg box was primarily associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but a similar fusion protein lacking the polybasic domain was exclusively localized in the soluble fraction . these data provide evidence for the minimal sequence required for _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ association of type ii rops in arabidopsis and other plant species .
sequence comparison of the hypervariable domains of type ii rops _PROTEIN_ from a variety of dicotyledonous and monocot plant species revealed several common features . two putatively s acylated cysteines are flanked by glycine residues in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and rice maize and tobacco _PROTEIN_ spiderwort cotton tree and wheat rops . in other type ii rops _PROTEIN_ there is at least one gc or cg pair . the upstream gc pair is conserved between type ii and some type i rops _PROTEIN_ . the cysteines in the gc cg sequence motif are separated by five or six residues referred to as . most of the residues are non _PROTEIN_ and/or hydrophobic . due to its conservation we designated the entire gc cg domain as the gc cg box . a subgroup of monocot rops _PROTEIN_ referred to as non gc cg box rops lacks the downstream cg pair . in these rops the sequence adjacent to the gc pair is non _PROTEIN_ as in the gc cg box . two members of this subgroup have an additional cysteine residue . other members retained the c terminal glycine and contain a proximal short basic motif _PROTEIN_ . and are divergent amongst the presented rops _PROTEIN_ having only the cg pair but lacking the upstream gc pair and with shorter polybasic domains . notably the amino acids that are immediately adjacent to the cysteines are aliphatic and aromatic and there are two arginines upstream of the cg pair which may facilitate interaction with the _LOCATION_ . with the exception of _PROTEIN_ type ii rops _PROTEIN_ do not have a canonical caax box motif . similar to _PROTEIN_ barley and wheat rops terminate with cxxx motifs with a lysine at the position which has been shown to inhibit prenylation . the other rops _PROTEIN_ have either two or seven amino acids downstream of the most c terminal cysteine . the polybasic domains are located adjacent to the upstream gc pair . the sequence conservation of the gc cg boxes and polybasic domains suggested that they might be required for association of type ii rops _PROTEIN_ with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to examine whether an intact gc cg box is required for _LOCATION_ association of type ii rops _PROTEIN_ the residues separating cysteines and in _PROTEIN_ and and in _PROTEIN_ were deleted . in turn the corresponding _METHOD_ fusion proteins were transiently _PROTEIN_ in nicotiana benthamiana plants . we have previously demonstrated using confocal imaging plasmolysis co localization with a _LOCATION_ marker and protein immunoblots of soluble and insoluble cell fractions and of proteins separated by _LOCATION_ floatation centrifugation that type ii rops _PROTEIN_ are localized in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . following _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was detected as a thin line of _METHOD_ circumventing the cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . to assess the subcellular signal distribution signal intensities along a line crossing the cell 's projection stack images were determined . the signal cross section profile of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ appeared as two side peaks _PROTEIN_ . for comparison the _METHOD_ distribution of free _METHOD_ was markedly different _METHOD_ . in the projection image the signal was detected in the cell periphery as a diffuse rather than a sharp line in _LOCATION_ and in cytoplasmic strands . this distribution was reflected in the cross section profile . the side peaks are wider reflecting the diffuse rather than sharp thin lines at the cell periphery the wide peak in the middle represents a _LOCATION_ and the smaller peaks represent cytoplasmic strands . the subcellular distribution of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was similar to that of _METHOD_ . cells _PROTEIN_ these mutants had fluorescing _LOCATION_ cytoplasmic strands and diffuse rather than sharp and thin lines of _METHOD_ at the cell periphery . these results suggested that the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ deletion mutants which contained the gc cg box cysteines but lacked the residues between them were no longer attached to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . more experiments were carried out to substantiate this finding . during plasmolysis the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ is detached from the cell wall and the cytoplasm shrinks forming patches . when labeled with a _METHOD_ probe such as _METHOD_ plasmolysis causes the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to appear as thin fluorescing strands detached from the cell wall and the cytoplasm as small patches of _METHOD_ . following plasmolysis the distribution of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ reflected its _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization _PROTEIN_ . the _METHOD_ appeared as thin lines and no patches were apparent _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . in contrast many patches and only weakly labeled strands were visible following plasmolysis of cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and non fused _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . these results were in agreement with the findings presented in figure and strongly suggested that the deletion of the gc cg box residues compromised association of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to further substantiate the results presented in figures and protein extracts were prepared from cells _PROTEIN_ either _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the extracts were in turn separated into soluble and insoluble fractions . following centrifugal separation at g _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was only detected in the insoluble pellet while _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was detected exclusively in the soluble fraction . the data presented in figures and have demonstrated that the residues between the cysteines in the gc cg box were required for the association of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . we then raised two questions is the sequence composition of the residues important for association of rops _PROTEIN_ with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or are these amino acids required just for spacing between the cysteines ? are the glycines important for _LOCATION_ association ? the next series of experiments was carried out to answer these questions . because the results obtained with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were similar further analysis was continued with _PROTEIN_ alone . to examine the importance of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for _LOCATION_ attachment they were mutated to alanines presenting a relatively small change in side group from hydrogen to methyl . mutating either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ resulted in a slight reduction in _LOCATION_ association _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . much of the proteins was still detected as a thin sharp line of _METHOD_ at the cell periphery . the cross section profiles of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants depicted the medium sized peaks due to _LOCATION_ and very small cytoplasmic peaks . the presence of the cytoplasmic peaks demonstrated the sensitivity of the cross section profile method since the signal was barely visible to the eye in the projection stack images . a much bigger change occurred in the _PROTEIN_ double mutant in which both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were mutated to alanines _PROTEIN_ . the _METHOD_ from both _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm was stronger _PROTEIN_ . the signal at the cell periphery however still appeared as a thin line of _METHOD_ and was depicted as sharp peaks in cross section profiles suggesting that part of the protein was still associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . position in _PROTEIN_ is occupied by a conserved asparagine residue . we assumed that _PROTEIN_ may play a structural function and therefore mutated it to proline a non _PROTEIN_ group that is known to disrupt helical structures . following _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was distributed between the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm _PROTEIN_ . previously we have demonstrated that mutants of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ that could not be modified by lipids accumulated in _LOCATION_ as a result of their polybasic domains acting as _LOCATION_ localization signals . thus the ratio of _METHOD_ measured in _LOCATION_ versus _LOCATION_ presented a quantitative assessment of the degree of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ association . statistical analysis indicated that the differences between the mutants were significant . the quantitative analysis confirmed the results presented in figure . the single glycine mutations had a weak effect with two to two and a half times more protein in the _LOCATION_ versus the _LOCATION_ . mutating the two glycines strongly disrupted association of their respective mutants with the _LOCATION_ and the proteins were almost equally distributed between _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . similarly substitution of _PROTEIN_ to proline disrupted _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ association more strongly than the single glycine mutations and in a similar manner to the double glycine mutant . to substantiate the data presented in figure the subcellular distribution of the _METHOD_ fusion mutant _PROTEIN_ proteins was examined by plasmolysis and immunoblots of soluble and insoluble protein fractions . following plasmolysis of all mutants _METHOD_ was detected as thin _LOCATION_ strands cytoplasmic patches and _LOCATION_ . _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ the _METHOD_ patches were less apparent in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ indicating that this mutation had only a minor effect on association of _PROTEIN_ with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the protein immunoblots reflected the _METHOD_ images following precipitation at g all four mutant proteins were detected in both the soluble and insoluble fractions . in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutants a bigger protein fraction was detected in the insoluble pellet . in contrast the differences between the soluble and insoluble fractions of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were less apparent . interestingly proteins recovered from soluble fractions migrated faster on _PROTEIN_ gels possibly reflecting differences in their lipid modification status . the results presented in figures and indicate that the amino acid composition of the gc cg box is important for the association of rops _PROTEIN_ with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . however in all these point mutants association with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was not completely compromised as it had been in the deletion mutants . this suggested that either the sequence was not altered enough to perturb association of rops _PROTEIN_ with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or that spacing between the cysteines in the gc cg box is also a determining _PROTEIN_ in the subcellular localization of these proteins . to discriminate between the two options mutations were made that _PROTEIN_ the distance of five amino acids between the gc cg box cysteines but at the same time changed the sequence properties . the residues of the gc cg box _PROTEIN_ were changed to reder to create the _PROTEIN_ mutant . these mutations changed the nature of the sequence from non _PROTEIN_ to charged . following _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ mutant was dispersed throughout the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ and was not attached to the _LOCATION_ as confirmed by the projection cross section profile plasmolysis and protein immunoblot . these results strongly suggested that the sequence composition of the gc cg box is a determining _PROTEIN_ affecting association of rops with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the results presented in figures indicate that the gc cg box of _PROTEIN_ is essential for its association with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to examine whether this sequence could act as a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ targeting/association domain facilitating s acylation it was fused to _METHOD_ and the resulting fusion protein designated _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana plants . similar to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was not associated with the _LOCATION_ but accumulated in the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ . this localization was confirmed by projection stack images and signal cross section profiles plasmolysis and protein immunoblots . thus the gc cg box is required but is not sufficient for association of rops _PROTEIN_ with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the question remained what is the minimal sequence that is required and sufficient for association of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ ? in several proteins polybasic domains were shown to facilitate interaction with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the following experiments were designed to assess the importance of the polybasic domain and to identify the minimal sequence required for association of _PROTEIN_ with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . residues comprising the polybasic domain were deleted to create _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . following _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamina leaf epidermal cells _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was localized in cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ similar to _METHOD_ . fluorescing _LOCATION_ and cytoplasmic strands were detected in projection stacks and signal cross section profiles and cytoplasmic patches were detected following plasmolysis . in protein immunoblots _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was detected in the soluble fraction but not in the insoluble pellet . these data indicate that the polybasic domain of _PROTEIN_ is required for association of this protein with the _LOCATION_ . the results also suggest that _METHOD_ is not associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ because it lacks a polybasic domain . to determine whether the polybasic domain together with the gc cg box comprise a minimal _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ association domain residues to of _PROTEIN_ were fused to _METHOD_ to create _METHOD_ . following its _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana _METHOD_ was primarily localized in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and only a small fraction was detected in _LOCATION_ . in protein immunoblots the majority of the protein was detected in the insoluble pellet fraction and a much fainter band was detected in the g soluble fraction . we suspect that the small fraction of protein detected in _LOCATION_ resulted from the relatively small size of the fusion protein or it may reflect higher _PROTEIN_ levels . the results in figures demonstrate that the polybasic domain together with the gc cg box are required and sufficient for association of _PROTEIN_ and most probably other type ii rops _PROTEIN_ with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ .
