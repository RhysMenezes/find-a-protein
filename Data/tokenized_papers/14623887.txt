tfii i is a ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ multifunctional transcription _PROTEIN_ with broad biological roles in transcription and signal transduction in a variety of cell types . we and others have shown that tfii i can interact physically and functionally with bruton 's tyrosine kinase a hematopoietic non receptor protein tyrosine kinase that is critical for b lymphocyte development . although tfii i btk interactions are impaired in b cells from x linked immunodeficient mice the precise molecular determinants governing tfii i btk complex formation remain unknown . to this end we have conducted a structural analysis of tfii i btk interactions by using a panel of tfii i mutants . these studies have revealed that a region within the n terminal amino acids of tfii i which includes a putative leucine zipper motif is primarily responsible for its interaction with btk . mutations in the leucine zipper region itself were not sufficient to abrogate binding of tfii i to btk suggesting that regions/residues outside the leucine zipper are responsible for such interactions . because the first amino acids of tfii i are required for its dimerization we propose that btk tethers tfii i to the cytoplasm by preventing its dimerization and its subsequent _LOCATION_ localization . we further examined the requirement of tyrosine phosphorylation for tfii i btk complex formation . our data showed that src dependent tyrosine phosphorylation sites in tfii i are not targeted by btk suggesting that multiple kinases can independently target tfii i via distinct signaling pathways . our results provide a beginning step toward understanding the functional importance of the tfii i btk pathway in b cell signaling and gene _PROTEIN_ .
analysis of tfii i btk interactions structural and phosphorylation deficient mutants of tfii work from our laboratory and of others showed that tfii i associates with btk both physically and functionally . tfii i subsequently becomes tyrosine phosphorylated and upon receptor cross linking in b cells translocates into the _LOCATION_ where it modulates transcriptional events . in order to understand the biological importance of btk mediated activation of tfii i it becomes imperative to determine what are the molecular _METHOD_ that drive such protein interactions . it is known that the pleckstrin homology domain of btk is important for its binding to tfii i . in contrast the binding domains for btk within tfii i have not been mapped . noteworthy is the _PROTEIN_ that several spliced _METHOD_ of tfii i exist and that interactions of these _METHOD_ with btk have not been examined . thus to elucidate the functional domains of tfii i that are responsible for its association with btk we conducted a systematic analysis of tfii i btk interactions by using a panel of tfii i mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the tfii i protein has a basic amino acid rich dna binding domain an activation domain at the c terminal end an n terminal region containing a putative dimerization domain six reiterated i repeats each containing a helix loop helix domain and several tyrosine residues that are targets of growth _PROTEIN_ mediated signaling . to determine the role of these tfii i domains in interaction with btk mutants were generated accordingly . these mutants fall into four categories . mutants that lacked n or c terminal ends viz . lacked a potential dimerization domain lacked the activation domain and behaved as a dominant negative and contained the n terminal half of the protein . internal mutants lacked either the dna binding/basic region the _LOCATION_ localization signal or the putative binding domain . the third category of mutants were fragments of tfii i containing isolated i repeats _PROTEIN_ and known to mediate interactions between _METHOD_ of tfii i and the n terminal amino acids of tfii i that contain the putative dimerization domain . in addition we investigated whether tyrosine phosphorylation is a requirement for tfii i btk complex formation by using mutants of tfii i and co _PROTEIN_ them with wild type ha tagged btk . these mutants were ectopically co _PROTEIN_ with ha tagged or _PROTEIN_ tagged btk in _PROTEIN_ cells . the schematization of deletion mutants as well as phosphorylation deficient point mutation constructs of tfii i is depicted in fig . . a control experiment was included in our study to corroborate previous data showing that ectopically _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tagged tfii i interacted with ha tagged btk in _PROTEIN_ cells . however in the absence of ectopically _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tfii i the anti ha antibody failed to precipitate any nonspecific proteins of the same molecular weight range as _PROTEIN_ tfii i . the blot was probed with anti tfii i antibody showing that _PROTEIN_ tfii i could be co precipitated in the presence of ha btk . importantly _PROTEIN_ tfii i was not immunoprecipitated with anti ha antibody when _PROTEIN_ in the absence of ha btk . the input lane showed the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ tfii i . moreover the same blot was stripped and re probed with anti ha antibody . although the level of ha btk _PROTEIN_ was low in wce lanes the ip lanes clearly showed that ha btk was immunoprecipitated . moreover in order to begin delineating the contact regions between tfii i and btk we investigated whether isolated i repeats of tfii i could by _METHOD_ associate with btk . the i repeats of tfii i contain helix loop helix motifs which are known to facilitate protein protein interactions . we chose the _PROTEIN_ and i repeats of tfii i based on previous data indicating that these isolated domains are capable of dimerizing with tfii i . an immunoprecipitation assay using anti ha antibody was conducted on whole cell lysates _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and . this was followed by immunoblotting with anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . whole cell extracts were included as controls for input level comparison with immunoprecipitated samples . the blot was also stripped and re probed with anti ha antibody to assess overall btk protein levels . our results indicate that the isolated repeats _PROTEIN_ and failed to interact with btk suggesting that these individual domains were not sufficient to mediate tfii i btk interactions . this experiment further showed that the anti ha antibody failed to precipitate any _PROTEIN_ fragment of tfii i indicating that nonspecific binding via the _PROTEIN_ moiety was minimal under our conditions . interaction and tyrosine phosphorylation of spliced variants of tfii i with are at least four splice variants of tfii i naturally occurring in mammals . the isoform is not _PROTEIN_ in murine cells but is _PROTEIN_ in human cells the isoform is _PROTEIN_ in both murine and human cells the isoform is _PROTEIN_ in both human and murine cells and is the most widely studied tfii i variant . because the isoform is predominantly if not exclusively _PROTEIN_ in neuronal cells we decided not to focus on this isoform for our studies . we have shown previously that the tfii i tfii i and tfii i _METHOD_ are capable of forming homomeric as well as heteromeric interactions with each other . this prompted us to test whether different _METHOD_ of tfii i could differentially bind to btk . hence tfii i tfii i and tfii i _METHOD_ were _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ cells as _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins in the presence of ectopic btk _PROTEIN_ . btk was immunoprecipitated using an anti ha antibody and its protein complex formation with different tfii i _METHOD_ was subsequently visualized using an anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . whole cell extracts were included as controls for input level comparison with immunoprecipitated samples . results show that the and _METHOD_ of tfii i can all associate with btk to a similar extent . the immunoblot was stripped and re probed with anti ha antibody to assess overall btk protein levels . subsequently we further examined whether the three tfii i _METHOD_ tested displayed any differences in tyrosine phosphorylation upon interaction with btk . variations in tyrosine phosphorylation between _METHOD_ upon co _PROTEIN_ with btk might provide a clue as to either functional and/or domain specific differences intrinsically exhibited by the tfii i splice variants . hence tyrosine phosphorylation status of the tfii i _METHOD_ in the presence of btk was analyzed via _PROTEIN_ pull down using an anti phosphotyrosine antibody . the immunoblot was stripped and re probed with anti _PROTEIN_ to detect comparable tfii i _PROTEIN_ levels . the immunoblot was stripped a second time and re probed with anti ha antibody to detect comparable btk protein levels . results indicated that the and _METHOD_ all exhibited similar tyrosine phosphorylation levels when co _PROTEIN_ with btk . furthermore in order to demonstrate that the tyrosine phosphorylation of tfii i _METHOD_ was due to the kinase activity of btk and not of other ubiquitous tyrosine kinases present in _PROTEIN_ cells a _PROTEIN_ pull down experiment was conducted in which tyrosine phosphorylation levels of tfii i or tfii i were assessed in the absence or presence of wild type btk via immunoblotting using an anti phosphotyrosine antibody . in addition we included in this experiment a condition where the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of tfii i were measured in the presence of a kinase inactive mutant form of btk anticipating that under this condition little or no tyrosine phosphorylation of pulled down tfii i should be observed . indeed results indicated that both tfii i and tfii i exhibited heightened tyrosine phosphorylation levels when in the presence of wild type btk but not in its absence or when in the presence of mutant btk . the immunoblot was stripped and re probed with anti _PROTEIN_ to monitor tfii i pull down levels . even though the amount of _PROTEIN_ tfii i precipitates in the absence of btk was slightly lower than the amount of _PROTEIN_ tfii i in the presence of wild type btk the normalized basal phosphorylation of tfii i _METHOD_ in the absence of wild type btk was still negligible as was the phosphorylation in the presence of further corroborating previous findings from our group and from others . similar results have also been observed with the isoform . our data also demonstrated that tyrosine phosphorylation of tfii i _METHOD_ and was comparable upon co _PROTEIN_ with btk and therefore not due to isoform specific differences . a control experiment was performed in order to demonstrate that the kinase activity of btk was intact under the _PROTEIN_ conditions employed thus an immunoprecipitation assay was carried out on whole cell lysates _PROTEIN_ either wild type btk or a kinase inactive mutant of btk using an anti ha antibody . the tyrosine phosphorylation status of wild type btk was compared with that of by immunoblotting with anti phosphotyrosine antibody . although wild type btk was readily auto phosphorylated at tyrosine residues the mutant was incapable of autophosphorylation the blot was stripped and re probed with an anti btk antibody to show equivalent immunoprecipitation levels of wild type btk or mutant btk . thus data indicated that the wild type btk used under our experimental conditions was capable of retaining bona fide kinase activity and that the mutant was indeed kinase inactive . noteworthy is the _PROTEIN_ that in immunoprecipitation and _PROTEIN_ pull down assays performed in the present study controls were included for single transfectants as well as for whole cell lysates incubated with beads alone or with pre immune serum as an irrelevant antibody control for immunoprecipitations . these negative controls have convinced us that samples used in the present study did not exhibit significant levels of nonspecific protein binding to beads . based on the results that no substantial differences in btk binding or tyrosine phosphorylation were observed between splice variants of tfii i and for the sake of simplicity we focused on tfii i in subsequent experiments . hence tfii i was used to examine which domains of tfii i were required for mediating protein interactions with btk . deletion of the n terminal region of tfii i impairs binding to data from our laboratory has indicated that certain deletional mutants of tfii i namely and are transcriptionally inactive . the mutant lacks the c terminal activation domain of tfii i lacks the n terminal amino acids containing the putative leucine zipper and composes a deletion within the dna binding domain of tfii i . furthermore we have shown that fails to dimerize with wild type tfii i isoform . consequently we investigated whether and also a shorter version of lacking repeat in addition to the c terminal activation region were capable of interacting with btk . we carried out an immunoprecipitation assay using anti ha to test these mutants when compared with wild type tfii i . protein complexes were visualized using anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . blots were stripped and re probed with anti ha antibody to reveal btk _PROTEIN_ levels . our data indicate that whereas and were capable of interacting with btk exhibited a significantly impaired interaction with btk . these immunoprecipitation experiments were conducted several times normalized densitometry measurements consistently showed a _PROTEIN_ of at least fold in binding to btk relative to wild type tfii i . hence we believe we have identified an important binding domain for btk in tfii i consisting of the first amino acids of the n terminus of tfii i which includes a putative leucine zipper . although it appeared that the mutant manifested a slightly _PROTEIN_ interaction with btk compared with wild type tfii i after careful examination of the densitometric values for this experiment this apparent _PROTEIN_ was found to be insignificant . the ability of to interact with btk will be addressed under the discussion. importantly immunoprecipitation assays revealed that the mutant is also capable of interacting with btk and thus btk does not appear to interact with and tether tfii i to the cytoplasm by directly masking its _LOCATION_ localization signal . although the possibility exists that btk might mask in our hands and in the cell types tested appears to be non functional . we subsequently performed additional experiments to determine whether any changes in tyrosine phosphorylation of the structural mutants relative to wild type tfii i could be observed upon co _PROTEIN_ with btk reasoning that a lack of protein interaction might be correlated to a defect in tyrosine phosphorylation of tfii i. namely we wanted to determine if tyrosine phosphorylation was required in order for these protein interactions to ensue . we observed that all mutants tested were tyrosine phosphorylated in the presence of btk albeit with an approximate fold _PROTEIN_ in tyrosine phosphorylation levels of the mutant relative to wild type tfii i . this _PROTEIN_ observation suggests that optimal btk dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of tfii i may require efficient physical interaction between the two proteins . the leucine zipper motif within the first amino acids of the n terminal region of tfii i is not critical for tfii i btk complex we were interested in better determining the importance of the n terminal domain of tfii i in facilitating tfii i btk interactions we examined whether the first amino acids of tfii i were necessary and/or sufficient to mediate tfii i btk complex formation . thus we generated a _PROTEIN_ fusion construct and performed an immunoprecipitation assay and wild type tfii i were co _PROTEIN_ with wild type btk in _PROTEIN_ cells and immunoprecipitated with anti ha antibody . protein complexes were visualized using anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . whole cell extracts were included as controls for input level comparison with immunoprecipitated samples . multiple bands recognized by the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody represent _PROTEIN_ tfii i degradation products . the blot was stripped and re probed with anti ha antibody to monitor btk protein levels . as anticipated the results revealed that was capable of interacting with btk just as well if not more strongly than wild type tfii i with btk . given that the domain of tfii i contains a putative leucine zipper motif we sought to examine whether the leucine zipper itself was required in facilitating tfii i btk interactions at the n terminal portion of tfii i . thus we generated three targeted mutants of the leucine zipper motif of tfii i by creating point mutations at positions pro and pro thus disrupting the functionality of the leucine zipper region . we subsequently tested these mutants and the double mutant along with the mutant in a _PROTEIN_ pull down assay . moreover because all previous data had been generated using ha tagged btk it was necessary to ensure that our results were not biased by the use of this particular tag . thus this _PROTEIN_ pull down assay was carried out using whole cell lysates _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tagged btk in conjunction with _PROTEIN_ tagged wild type or mutant tfii i constructs . protein complexes were visualized using an anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . the blot was stripped and re probed with anti _PROTEIN_ antibody to control for tfii i protein levels . a control experiment was performed to accompany the _PROTEIN_ pull down assay showing that a _PROTEIN_ tagged empty vector _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ cells failed to be recognized by an anti _PROTEIN_ antibody or by an anti _PROTEIN_ antibody at the molecular weight corresponding to _PROTEIN_ tfii i . in contrast the interaction between _PROTEIN_ tfii i and _PROTEIN_ btk was clearly visualized by an anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . the blot was stripped and re probed with anti _PROTEIN_ antibody to indicate the level of precipitated _PROTEIN_ tfii i at kda . in addition we have performed control experiments using the _PROTEIN_ empty vector in immunoprecipitation assays as well and we have obtained the same results . input levels of total protein from whole cell lysates used in the _PROTEIN_ pull down were visualized on a separate blot using anti _PROTEIN_ antibody to detect btk _PROTEIN_ stripped and re probed with anti _PROTEIN_ antibody to detect tfii i protein levels . surprisingly as can be seen from anti _PROTEIN_ immunoblotting of the _PROTEIN_ pull down all three leucine zipper mutants were able to interact with btk . this indicated that disruption of the leucine zipper motif did not significantly affect the ability of tfii i to associate with btk and therefore that regions outside of the leucine zipper region and yet comprised within the first amino acids of tfii i were probably responsible for mediating tfii i btk complex formation . worth indicating is the _PROTEIN_ that we conducted further immunoprecipitation assays using anti _PROTEIN_ antibody with most of the mutants tested in this study the results confirmed for instance that the diminished interaction between btk and relative to wild type was reproducible using the _PROTEIN_ tag . hence the use of a particular tag _PROTEIN_ did not influence our results . immunolocalization of tfii i with btk in _PROTEIN_ we have shown physical interactions of tfii i with btk in primary b cell cytoplasm and consequently the level of constitutive _LOCATION_ tfii i is higher in xid b cells whether these two proteins interact in _PROTEIN_ cell cytoplasm has not been addressed . in order to visualize the ability of tfii i to interact with btk in _PROTEIN_ cell cytoplasm _PROTEIN_ tagged tfii i dna constructs were transiently _PROTEIN_ in the absence or presence of _PROTEIN_ tagged btk . subsequently the extent of co localization of either wild type or mutant tfii i with btk was assessed by _METHOD_ microscopy utilizing an anti _PROTEIN_ antibody to detect tfii i protein and an anti btk antibody to detect btk protein . dapi staining was used to stain cell _LOCATION_ . results indicated that ectopically _PROTEIN_ wild type tfii i localized predominantly to the _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ cells in the absence of btk . it is important to emphasize that in transient transfection assays in _PROTEIN_ cells ectopically _PROTEIN_ wild type tfii i naturally localizes to the _LOCATION_ of this cell type artificially simulating an activation driven translocation of tfii i into the _LOCATION_ due to the nature of its overexpression . the merge panel denotes the juxtaposition of fluorochrome staining indicating that tfii i mostly localized to the dapi stained _LOCATION_ . btk localized extensively to the cellular cytoplasm in the absence of other co _PROTEIN_ proteins . however when wild type tfii i was co _PROTEIN_ with btk a significantly increased _PROTEIN_ of tfii i in the cytoplasm was observed . the increased co localization of tfii i with btk can be detected by the yellow staining in the merge panel . in addition we tested the ability of the mutant of tfii i to interact with btk anticipating that this mutant would not be able to localize to the _LOCATION_ . however the precise subcellular localization of this mutant was unpredictable . immunostaining experiments showed that the mutant localized extensively to the cytoplasm of _PROTEIN_ cells in a diffused pattern in the absence and in the presence of btk . although this result is not a demonstration of a direct btk interaction it is nonetheless consistent with physical interactions between and btk that were shown biochemically . thus the cellular biology results are in concordance with the previously obtained biochemical data further supporting the notion that both wild type tfii i as well as tfii i are capable of interacting with btk in the cytoplasm . the first amino acids of the n terminal region of tfii i are sufficient in mediating dimeric interactions with the and with the _METHOD_ of tfii that the first amino acids in tfii i were also indirectly implicated in its dimerization we tested whether would directly mediate dimerization of tfii i _METHOD_ . thus a _PROTEIN_ pull down assay was performed in order to test the ability of tfii i and tfii i _METHOD_ to dimerize with the mutant . tfii i tfii i as well as were _PROTEIN_ as _METHOD_ fusion proteins in the presence of _PROTEIN_ tagged or _PROTEIN_ tagged tfii i . interactions with tfii i _METHOD_ were detected via anti _METHOD_ immunoblotting . input levels of total protein from whole cell lysates used in the _PROTEIN_ pull down were also included . the blot was stripped and re probed with anti _PROTEIN_ to control for or tfii i _PROTEIN_ tagged protein levels . results indicated that as previously demonstrated tfii i was able to dimerize with itself . moreover both tfii i and tfii i were shown to interact with . as expected our negative control showed that failed to interact with the mutant . these findings suggest that represents a dimerization domain that is sufficient in mediating interactions with different tfii i _METHOD_ as well as with btk . phosphorylation of src dependent tyrosine residues within tfii i is not required for tfii i btk complex work from our laboratory has established that phosphorylation at tyrosine residues and is required for src dependent transcriptional activation of tfii i . thus we questioned whether these same src specific tyrosine phosphorylation sites within tfii i were necessary for tfii i btk binding and whether they were phosphorylated by btk upon complex formation . to test this idea we conducted an immunoprecipitation assay using anti ha antibody . the src dependent phosphorylation mutants of tfii i in addition to the mutant and the double mutant were co _PROTEIN_ with wild type btk . protein complexes were visualized using anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . whole cell extracts were included as controls for input level comparison with immunoprecipitated samples . our data demonstrated that all phosphorylation deficient mutants tested were able to interact with btk . in addition interactions between and btk were also monitored in this assay . taken together with previous results our data collectively indicate that a deletion at the _PROTEIN_ site impaired neither the interaction of with btk nor the phosphorylation of by btk . subsequently we conducted a _PROTEIN_ pull down assay to examine the ability of the src dependent phosphorylation deficient mutants of tfii i to be phosphorylated by btk . a negative control for tfii i i mutants was also included in this assay . tyrosine phosphorylation of tfii i in the presence of btk was visualized using an anti phosphotyrosine antibody . the immunoblot was stripped and re probed with anti _PROTEIN_ to detect tfii i _PROTEIN_ levels . results collectively show that all src dependent phosphorylation deficient tfii i mutants as well as the control mutant were capable of interacting with btk and furthermore exhibited comparable levels of tyrosine phosphorylation when co _PROTEIN_ with btk . hence btk did not target the previously identified src specific tyrosine phosphorylation sites . a _PROTEIN_ pull down experiment was conducted in order to illustrate the requirement for the _PROTEIN_ site in mediating c src tfii i interactions . wild type tfii i and were _PROTEIN_ as _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins in the presence of ectopic wild type c src . protein complexes were subsequently visualized using an anti c src antibody . exhibited a markedly impaired ability to interact with c src when compared with wild type tfii i . whole cell extracts were included as controls for input level comparison with glutathione agarose treated pull down samples . the blot was stripped and re probed with anti _PROTEIN_ to demonstrate tfii i levels . we concluded from this experiment that in agreement with our expectations the _PROTEIN_ site was required for c src tfii i complex formation despite the _PROTEIN_ that we observed a modest degree of interaction between wild type tfii i and c src . phosphorylation of src dependent tyrosine residues within tfii i is not required for btk tfii i mediated transcription of the c fos src dependent phosphorylation deficient mutants of tfii i were shown to interact with btk and to be phosphorylated by the latter their transcriptional effects on the c fos promoter upon co _PROTEIN_ with btk needed to be tested in functional assays . wild type tfii i and mutants were _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ cells in the absence or presence of ha tagged btk . subsequently we assessed in reporter assays the effect of btk on wild type or mutant tfii i mediated transcription of the c fos promoter . whole cell lysates of samples used in the luciferase reporter were analyzed via western blotting tfii i protein levels were detected using anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . the immunoblot was stripped and re probed with anti ha to control for btk _PROTEIN_ levels . our data indicate that the phosphorylation deficient mutants of tfii i exhibited similar effects on c fos transcription relative to wild type tfii i whether in the absence or in the presence of btk . indeed as observed previously overexpression of btk induced an increase in transcription of the c fos promoter in the presence of wild type tfii i and _PROTEIN_ of btk alone had no appreciable effects on the c fos promoter . it might be argued that a slight _PROTEIN_ is observed in the btk dependent transcriptional activity of the mutant on the c fos promoter . however upon careful examination of the data one can observe that this apparent drop in transcriptional activity is also accompanied by slightly lower levels in ectopic tfii i protein _PROTEIN_ in this sample . moreover our data have been consistently reproducible and have been confirmed by other experiments of a similar kind . the data presented here demonstrate that the src dependent phosphorylation mutants of tfii i did not abrogate btk mediated basal transcription of the c fos promoter suggesting that btk does not target these sites under the conditions tested . the transcriptional effects are modest but they represent basal levels of transcriptional activity given that the assay was conducted in the absence of any growth _PROTEIN_ stimulation .
