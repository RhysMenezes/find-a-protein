the biogenesis of spliceosomal snrnps takes place in both the cytoplasm where sm core proteins are added and snrnas are modified at the and termini and in the _LOCATION_ where snrnp specific proteins associate . snrnp consists of snrna seven sm proteins and three snrnp specific proteins _PROTEIN_ and . it has been shown previously that after import to the _LOCATION_ and snrnp specific proteins first appear in cajal bodies and then in splicing speckles . in addition in cells grown under normal conditions and snrnas/snrnps are abundant in cbs . therefore it has been proposed that the final assembly of these spliceosomal snrnps takes place in this _LOCATION_ compartment . in contrast snrna in both animal and plant cells has rarely been found in this _LOCATION_ compartment . here we analysed the subnuclear distribution of arabidopsis snrnp specific proteins fused to _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ in transiently transformed arabidopsis protoplasts . irrespective of the tag used was exclusively found in the _LOCATION_ whereas _PROTEIN_ and were equally distributed between the _LOCATION_ and the cytoplasm . in the _LOCATION_ all three proteins localised to cbs and nucleoli although to different extent . interestingly we also found that the appearance of the three proteins in _LOCATION_ speckles differ significantly . was mostly found in speckles whereas _PROTEIN_ and in of cells showed diffuse nucleoplasmic in combination with cbs and nucleolar localisation . our data indicate that cbs and nucleolus are involved in the maturation of snrnp . differences in _LOCATION_ accumulation and distribution between and _PROTEIN_ and proteins may indicate that either or _PROTEIN_ and associate with or is/are involved in other _LOCATION_ processes apart from pre mrna splicing .
we could previously show that transient _PROTEIN_ of snrnp specific proteins in arabidopsis protoplasts results in their correct localisation in the _LOCATION_ . in particular it has been shown that and proteins localise in a diffuse/speckled nucleoplasmic pattern with the majority of cells also showing localisation in cbs and to a lesser extent in nucleoli . therefore we used this experimental system combined with confocal microscopy to analyse the localisation of arabidopsis snrnp specific proteins _PROTEIN_ and . as can be seen from the all three proteins localised to the _LOCATION_ . however was exclusively found in the _LOCATION_ whereas _PROTEIN_ and were found in the _LOCATION_ and in the cytoplasm in virtually all cells . as _METHOD_ is a rather large tag it could possibly influence the import of small proteins _PROTEIN_ into the _LOCATION_ . therefore biochemical fractionation of protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and ha tagged proteins into _LOCATION_ and cytoplasmic fractions was performed . these experiments revealed that hours after transformation approximately of _PROTEIN_ and proteins remained cytoplasmic irrespective of the tag used . in contrast could not be detected in the cytoplasmic fraction . analysis of the distribution of _LOCATION_ and cytoplasmic proteins _PROTEIN_ and fructose bisphosphatase indicated that fractionation procedure was specific . we also compared the _PROTEIN_ levels of proteins as this might influence _LOCATION_ import . however analysis of _METHOD_ tagged proteins revealed similar _PROTEIN_ levels for all three proteins analysed . control western analysis with antibody against the tubulin revealed that equal amounts of proteins were loaded in each lane . finally no major degradation products were observed for any of the three proteins . thus the cytoplasmic localisation of _PROTEIN_ and proteins is not due to their higher _PROTEIN_ levels or protein degradation . single confocal sections of protoplasts _PROTEIN_

extracts were analysed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and western blotting with anti _METHOD_ antibody . molecular _METHOD_ standards in kda are indicated on the left . western blotting of the same protein extracts with anti tubulin antibodies was performed as a loading control . transient _PROTEIN_ of ha and _METHOD_ tagged and in arabidopsis cell suspension protoplasts resulted in their correct assembly into mature snrnps . to find out whether transiently _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and proteins associate with snrnp immunoprecipitations with anti antibody which recognizes the trimethylguanosine cap structure at the end of u snrnas were performed . demonstrates that _METHOD_ and ha tagged _PROTEIN_ and proteins were efficiently precipitated with anti antibody indicating association with the mature snrnp . to further support this observation protein extracts form protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti _METHOD_ antibodies followed by rna extraction . analysis of immunoprecipitates for the presence of snrnas by pcp labelling revealed efficient co precipitation of snrna with both proteins but not of other spliceosomal snrnas . immunoprecipitation performed with anti _METHOD_ antibody and protein extracts from non transformed cells indicated that the procedure was specific . shows that no appreciable amounts of snrna were precipitated . from the immunoprecipitation data shown in and from our previous data we conclude that transient _PROTEIN_ of snrnp specific proteins in arabidopsis protoplasts results in efficient incorporation into mature snrnps . immunoprecipitation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusion proteins with anti antibody . lanes input protein extract . lanes protein extracts incubated with protein a sepharose .

respectively . from the images shown in it is obvious that the three snrnp specific proteins show different localisation patterns in the _LOCATION_ . as we observed that the frequencies of the identified _LOCATION_ patterns differed between and _PROTEIN_ proteins we performed quantitative analysis . to do so three independent transformations of arabidopsis protoplasts were performed and _LOCATION_ localisation patterns for the three snrnp specific proteins were scored by counting cells for each protein . the most common patterns observed with _PROTEIN_ and proteins are shown in respectively . in general we can say that all three proteins show diffuse nucleoplasmic staining with or without cbs localisation diffuse nucleoplasmic staining with nucleolar localisation diffuse nucleoplasmic staining with nucleolar and cbs localisation speckled nucleoplasmic localisation with or without nucleolar and cbs staining . however it is important to note that most cells showing speckled localisation did not show localisation in nucleoli and cbs and that in the majority of cells nucleolar staining was restricted to the nucleolar cavity . next we compared the percentages of cells showing speckled and diffuse nucleoplasmic localisation . from three independent transformations it became clear that localises into speckles in of analysed cells whereas _PROTEIN_ and showed speckled pattern only in and of analysed cells respectively . quantification of cells with nucleolar and cb localisation revealed further differences between and _PROTEIN_ proteins . localised in cbs and in nucleoli in and of cells respectively whereas these numbers for _PROTEIN_ and were and for cbs and and for nucleoli . the total number of cells showing both nucleolar and cb localisation in combination with either speckled or diffuse nucleoplasmic staining was also dramatically different being only for and and for _PROTEIN_ and respectively . percentages of cells showing diffuse nucleoplasmic and cb localisation were similar for all three proteins for for _PROTEIN_ and for . a low percentage of cells _PROTEIN_ also showed a speckled pattern in combination with cb localisation . finally _PROTEIN_ and were found in speckles in combination with cb localisation _METHOD_ with frequencies less then whereby the intensity of speckle _METHOD_ was significantly lower compared to that of . representative images of _LOCATION_ patterns observed in protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ tagged proteins . single confocal sections are shown . arrows arrowheads and asterisks point to nucleoli cbs and nucleolar cavities respectively . scale bars . transformations with _METHOD_ tagged proteins were performed independently three times and each time randomly chosen cells were analysed . speckled and diffuse nucleoplasmic staining patterns were scored and percentages are indicated inside the bars . cb and nucleolar localisation as well as combinations of different patterns as indicated on x axis were scored . the y axis represents the percentage of cells showing specific pattern . taken together these results suggest that cbs and nucleoli are involved in snrnp maturation . furthermore it is obvious that higher proportion of accumulates in speckles compared to cbs and nucleoli whereas _PROTEIN_ and are most abundant in these two _LOCATION_ compartments and are rarely found in speckles . having established that transiently _PROTEIN_ snrnp specific proteins assemble correctly into mature snrnp we asked next whether they co localise when co _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts . this was particularly interesting as we observed that and _PROTEIN_ proteins showed strikingly different _LOCATION_ localisation patterns . as _PROTEIN_ and showed the same frequencies for all _LOCATION_ localisation patterns observed we first asked whether they co localise in arabidopsis protoplasts . cells co _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed perfect co localisation of proteins in cbs nucleoli and nucleoplasm . in addition co _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ with _METHOD_ resulted in co localisation of the two protein pairs in cbs and nucleoplasm . this is in agreement with the _PROTEIN_ that at the steady state in both plant and animal cells snrnp accumulates in cbs and further support our observation that cbs are sites of snrnp biogenesis . co localisation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . co localisation of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . co localisation of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . arrows arrowheads and asterisks point to nucleoli cbs and nucleolar cavities respectively . all images are single confocal sections . scale bars . was shown to localise primarily in a speckled pattern in the nucleoplasm although localisation in cbs and nucleoli was also observed . this was quite different from the localisation pattern frequencies observed with _PROTEIN_ and proteins . co _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ tagged with _METHOD_ resulted in co localisation of the two proteins in the diffuse nucleoplasmic pool . co localisation was also observed in cbs but only in cells where did not show a speckled pattern . however _METHOD_ intensities of in cbs were much lower compared to that of . consistent with the _PROTEIN_ that did not strongly accumulate in nucleoli very little co localisation between these two proteins was observed in this compartment . finally in cells showing a speckled localisation pattern for co localisation with was not observed in cbs and very little in speckles . this is consistent with the frequencies of different patterns occurring in cells _PROTEIN_ and alone . also this indicated that co _PROTEIN_ of two proteins does not influence localisation of each other . taken together our localisation and co localisation data indicate that the assembly of and _PROTEIN_ proteins into mature snrnp are either following different pathways or different kinetics . protein might largely localise directly to speckles without passage through cbs and nucleoli which may indicate an additional role for this protein apart from being a snrnp component involved in pre mrna splicing .
