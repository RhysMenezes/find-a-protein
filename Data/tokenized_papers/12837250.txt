_PROTEIN_ is an essential regulator of plant systemic acquired resistance which confers immunity to a broad spectrum of pathogens . sar induction results in accumulation of the signal molecule salicylic acid which induces defense gene _PROTEIN_ via activation of _PROTEIN_ . we found that in an uninduced state _PROTEIN_ is present as an oligomer formed through intermolecular disulfide bonds . upon sar induction a biphasic change in cellular reduction potential occurs resulting in reduction of _PROTEIN_ to a monomeric form . monomeric _PROTEIN_ accumulates in the _LOCATION_ and activates gene _PROTEIN_ . inhibition of _PROTEIN_ reduction prevents defense gene _PROTEIN_ whereas mutation of or _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ leads to constitutive monomerization _LOCATION_ localization of the mutant proteins and defense gene _PROTEIN_ . these data provide a missing link between accumulation of sa and activation of _PROTEIN_ in the sar signaling pathway .
to determine whether the cysteines in _PROTEIN_ affect the conformation of the protein before and after sar induction we performed protein extractions in the absence of reducing agents such as dithiothreitol . as controls dtt was _PROTEIN_ added to aliquots of the same extracts . protein extracts from wild type columbia plants treated with the sar inducer ina or with water were subjected to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ followed by immunoblot analysis . in the absence of dtt _PROTEIN_ protein was only observed in samples prepared from ina treated plants but not from water treated plants citation . however in the samples to which dtt was added after extraction equal amounts of _PROTEIN_ protein were detected with or without ina treatment . ina treatment seemed to have the same effect on the _PROTEIN_ protein as dtt . similar results were obtained from samples treated with two other sar inducers sa and bth . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ may exist in a different state or conformation before and after sar induction . evidently the polyclonal antibody raised against the n terminal half of _PROTEIN_ could only recognize the ina activated form of the protein . to detect _PROTEIN_ in both ina treated as well as untreated samples we used another _PROTEIN_ antibody raised against a amino acid peptide at the c terminus and found that it crossreacted with other homologs of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . as an alternative approach we tested the previously characterized transgenic line carrying the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background citation . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is regulated in a similar fashion to endogenous _PROTEIN_ allowing us to use this transgenic line to study the behavior of _PROTEIN_ using a commercially available antibody against _METHOD_ . protein samples extracted from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants treated with ina or water were subjected to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and immunoblot analysis . as shown in citation in the absence of dtt the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was detected at the expected mw only in the ina treated sample but not in the untreated sample . this is consistent with the result obtained using the antibody against the endogenous _PROTEIN_ . however an additional protein band with a much higher mw was detected in both samples . the addition of dtt to both extracts eliminated this complex and reduced all the _PROTEIN_ protein to the monomeric form on the gel as shown by the downward shift of the high mw protein band to mw . this suggests that an _PROTEIN_ containing complex is formed through intermolecular disulfide bonds . significantly the disulfide bonds can be partially reduced as a result of ina induction . the reduced monomeric form of _PROTEIN_ observed in the immunoblot analysis probably represents an in vivo conformation of the protein because in a gel filtration experiment under nondenaturing conditions monomeric _PROTEIN_ was detected after sar induction . however the high mw protein complex detected in the immunoblot analysis could be a product of nonspecific crosslinking caused by disulfide bond formation during sample preparation . to rule out this possibility we homogenized plant tissue and denatured the protein in the presence of the alkylating agents mm iodoacetamide or n ethylmaleimide which block free thiol groups from forming nonspecific disulfide bonds while keeping existing disulfide bonds intact citation . the immunoblot of the resultant samples is shown in citation revealing that treatment with iod or nem during sample preparation did not affect the formation of the high mw protein complex confirming that the complex existed in intact plant cells prior to protein extraction . identical results were obtained using fold higher concentration of nem . as an additional control immunoblot analysis of samples from _METHOD_ transgenic plants treated with ina or water showed that the _METHOD_ protein alone did not form a high mw complex indicating that the complex observed in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic line formed through the cysteines in _PROTEIN_ . to determine the nature of the high mw complex we added a low concentration of dtt to the protein extraction buffer to artificially generate intermediates of the oligomer to monomer reaction . as shown in citation under these weakly reducing conditions proteins with mws of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dimer and trimer were detected . this result indicated that the high mw protein complex is either a homooligomer of _PROTEIN_ or a heterooligomer formed between _PROTEIN_ and a protein of similar mw . immunoprecipitation performed using the anti _METHOD_ monoclonal antibody showed that this antibody could not only precipitate _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ but also the endogenous _PROTEIN_ citation . this observation favors the hypothesis that the high mw complex is a homooligomer of _PROTEIN_ . from the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gel in citation it is difficult to determine precisely how many _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins are in the oligomer . it is possible that the high mw band on the gel consists of oligomers with varying numbers of _PROTEIN_ . we can not rule out the possibility that other proteins besides _PROTEIN_ are part of this complex . to demonstrate that the _PROTEIN_ oligomer can be reduced to the monomer in vivo we also performed an ina induction experiment in the presence of of cycloheximide to inhibit new protein synthesis . without protein synthesis _PROTEIN_ monomer still appeared after ina treatment indicating that the monomeric _PROTEIN_ came from reduction of the oligomer citation . the ina induced switch of _PROTEIN_ protein from oligomer to monomer suggests that there might be a _PROTEIN_ in the reduction potential in plants following induction . to test this hypothesis we measured the changes in the glutathione pool after ina treatment because glutathione is a major thiol disulfide redox buffer in plant cells citation . measurements of total glutathione and gssg levels have previously been made to estimate the redox environment in plants after pathogen attack citation . as shown in citation ina treatment caused similar changes in kinetics in the total glutathione levels and the gsh/gssg ratios which first showed a dramatic _PROTEIN_ hr after ina treatment followed by a sharp increase reaching a plateau hr after ina treatment . the change in the gsh/gssg ratio appeared to be influenced _PROTEIN_ by the concentration of gsh . to determine whether similar redox changes also occur in systemic tissues we measured the total glutathione levels and the gsh/gssg ratios in plants inoculated with the bacterial pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv maculicola carrying the avirulence gene . half leaves were infected with the pathogen and the uninfected halves were collected for the measurements . we found that in these uninfected tissues total glutathione and gsh/gssg ratio were significantly increased reaching peak levels of mm and respectively hr after infection citation . these increases were not observed in mock inoculated plants . we also measured glutathione concentrations in leaves distal to the infection site and did not observe consistent results probably because the signals were too weak or too diluted . to test whether the observed changes in the glutathione pool and gsh/gssg ratio could result in reduction of the _PROTEIN_ oligomer in vitro we incubated protein extracts from uninduced plants in defined concentrations of gsh/gssg at for hr before _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . as shown by immunoblot analysis citation the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ monomer began to appear in significant amounts when the gsh/gssg ratio exceeded . to test whether this reaction is reversible we also used protein extracts from ina treated plants . at a gsh/gssg ratio below the monomeric _PROTEIN_ started to be oxidized to the oligomeric form . it is interesting to note that the gsh/gssg ratio required for in vitro _PROTEIN_ reduction is similar to that reached in plants after sar induction . however these data only show a correlation of the redox changes of these two redox couples they do not indicate that gsh/gssg and _PROTEIN_ monomer/oligomer are in redox equilibrium . these data confirm that sar induction leads to a _PROTEIN_ in cellular reduction potential . consequently the cysteine residues in _PROTEIN_ are reduced releasing the _PROTEIN_ monomer from the oligomeric complex . the reducing agent that is directly involved in this process has yet to be determined . sar induction not only switches _PROTEIN_ protein from oligomer to monomer but also activates downstream pr gene _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ monomerization might be a regulatory mechanism by which sa turns on _PROTEIN_ dependent gene _PROTEIN_ . to test this hypothesis a time course experiment was performed to follow the kinetics of _PROTEIN_ reduction and _PROTEIN_ dependent _PROTEIN_ of pr genes . following ina treatment monomerization of the _PROTEIN_ protein preceded _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ as shown in citation . significant amounts of _PROTEIN_ monomer were detected hr after ina treatment while _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ became prominent hr after ina treatment . the tight correlation between the two events supports the hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ protein monomerization is a regulatory step required for the activation of pr gene _PROTEIN_ . even though _PROTEIN_ reduction and _PROTEIN_ gene activation citation correlated with the cellular redox changes as measured using glutathione citation _PROTEIN_ reduction seemed to appear earlier than the gsh/gssg ratio increase . this might be explained by the nonsynchronous nature of induction . in the induced tissue the redox environment in some cells might be reduced enough for _PROTEIN_ monomerization and _PROTEIN_ gene activation while in other cells the reduction potential had yet to _PROTEIN_ . the overall gsh/gssg ratio might not accurately reflect the redox environment of the cellular compartment _LOCATION_ where _PROTEIN_ resides . glutathione concentrations of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ mitochondria and chloroplasts can all contribute to the overall gsh/gssg ratio . an alternative explanation of this observation is that gsh is not the direct reducing agent of _PROTEIN_ in vivo . besides glutathione other redox controlling molecules such as thioredoxin may be involved in regulating _PROTEIN_ reduction . to confirm that _PROTEIN_ reduction is indeed a process associated with sar we performed biological induction of sar using psm . uninfected half leaves and distal leaves were collected and examined for _PROTEIN_ monomerization and _PROTEIN_ gene induction hr and three days after inoculation respectively . a correlation between the presence of _PROTEIN_ monomer and the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was observed in the systemic tissues citation . to establish a causative relationship between the reduction of _PROTEIN_ and activation of _PROTEIN_ transcription we sought a means to prevent _PROTEIN_ reduction after ina treatment . the pentose phosphate pathway _PROTEIN_ provides the _LOCATION_ source of nadph which is a major donor of electrons for reductive reactions citation . an inhibitor of _PROTEIN_ aminonicotinamide _PROTEIN_ has been used widely to deplete cells of nadph and prevent reductive reactions citation . to demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ reduction is essential for pr gene activation we treated plants with ina followed by _PROTEIN_ . as shown in citation _PROTEIN_ diminished the increases in total glutathione and gsh/gssg ratio induced by ina partially inhibited _PROTEIN_ monomerization and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ . therefore we concluded that _PROTEIN_ reduction is likely a prerequisite for pr gene _PROTEIN_ . although the _PROTEIN_ inhibitor _PROTEIN_ could prevent _PROTEIN_ reduction and _PROTEIN_ pr gene _PROTEIN_ in response to ina induction we could not rule out the possibility that _PROTEIN_ affected reduction of other unknown _PROTEIN_ in the pr gene regulating pathway . to provide further evidence to support our notion that _PROTEIN_ monomerization is a critical regulatory step for the activation of pr genes mutations were introduced into the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct to alter the sequences encoding each of the ten conserved cysteines . besides three of the cysteines which were changed to a tyrosine or a serine _PROTEIN_ the rest of the cysteines were changed to an alanine _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the resulting constructs _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were then transformed into the _PROTEIN_ background and the conformation and the functionality of the mutant proteins were examined in the transgenic plants . for each mutant construct multiple independent transformants were characterized and the average amount of total _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein accumulated in plants was estimated using samples prepared in the presence of dtt . as shown in citation which includes one representative line from each construct two mutants showed less protein accumulation than the wild type while the other seven mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed almost the same levels of protein accumulation as the wild type . in our previous experiments no effect on protein accumulation was observed in the _PROTEIN_ mutant which carries the mutation . to examine the conformations of the mutant proteins we also prepared the protein samples in the absence of dtt . without sar induction seven mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were present only in the oligomeric form similar to the wild type protein . however in the and _PROTEIN_ mutants monomeric _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was detected constitutively . this indicated that formation of oligomers in these mutants was partially inhibited by the cysteine to alanine mutations . more importantly the presence of monomeric _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in these two mutants coincided with constitutively elevated _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ citation . this result clearly demonstrated that the monomeric form of _PROTEIN_ is a biologically active conformation sufficient for induction of pr gene _PROTEIN_ . to investigate further the molecular mechanism underlying activation of _PROTEIN_ through monomerization we performed _LOCATION_ fractionation experiment in the absence of dtt . we found that only monomeric form of _PROTEIN_ was present in the _LOCATION_ of ina treated plants citation . there was a correlation between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ monomerization and _LOCATION_ localization of the protein . this observation suggested that monomerization of _PROTEIN_ might be sufficient for its _LOCATION_ accumulation . if this is the case monomerized _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the and _PROTEIN_ mutants should be able to accumulate in the _LOCATION_ in the absence of ina treatment . to test this hypothesis we examined _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in plants transformed with the different _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs . we found that without ina treatment the and _PROTEIN_ mutants indeed showed significantly enhanced _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ compared to wild type and other mutants citation . to confirm this result we performed a _LOCATION_ fractionation experiment on the and _PROTEIN_ mutants . the resulting _LOCATION_ protein extracts together with the total protein extracts were subjected to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ followed by immunoblot analysis . as shown in citation while equal amounts of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were detected in the total protein extracts only _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were found in the _LOCATION_ fraction . therefore we conclude that monomerization of _PROTEIN_ leads to its _LOCATION_ accumulation and subsequently pr gene induction .
