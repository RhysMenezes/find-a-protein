arabinogalactan proteins _PROTEIN_ are present on the surface of all plant cells . _PROTEIN_ and comprise the lysine rich _PROTEIN_ subfamily in arabidopsis and consist of an n terminal signal peptide a classical _PROTEIN_ domain interrupted by a small lys rich region and a c terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor addition sequence . organ and tissue specific _PROTEIN_ patterns and subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ were studied and compared to other lys rich _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was highly _PROTEIN_ in roots flowers and _METHOD_ and weakly _PROTEIN_ in seedlings and rosettes . high _PROTEIN_ promoter activity was closely associated with vascular tissues and high in young organs as well as styles . microarray and _METHOD_ parallel signature sequencing _PROTEIN_ data were also examined and showed largely consistent transcription profiles of _PROTEIN_ . on the protein level _PROTEIN_ was most abundant in roots and flowers moderate in _METHOD_ seedlings and siliques and low in rosette leaves . furthermore _PROTEIN_ was localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and to hechtian strands following plasmolysis of tobacco cultured cells _PROTEIN_ a green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein . localization of _PROTEIN_ on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was further confirmed by biochemical two phase fractionation and western blotting . these _PROTEIN_ and localization data further our understanding of _PROTEIN_ and provide a molecular basis to approach and decipher its function .
all lys rich _PROTEIN_ identified to date have an n terminal signal sequence a central _PROTEIN_ domain containing a small lys rich region and a c terminal gpi anchor addition sequence . amino acid sequences of the lys rich _PROTEIN_ were aligned . when compared to other lys rich _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ had highest and lowest amino acid similarity/identity with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . in order to provide some insight on the relationship among lys rich _PROTEIN_ and other _PROTEIN_ a phylogeny tree was created . all known lys rich _PROTEIN_ clustered together _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were closely related . in contrast _PROTEIN_ was most closely related to and . northern blot analyses revealed that _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis was high in roots flowers and _METHOD_ and low in seedlings and rosettes . the organ specific _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ was also compared to microarray and _PROTEIN_ data as discussed _PROTEIN_ . in the arabidopsis cell culture _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were high in exponentially growing cells and _PROTEIN_ with time . to investigate the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ on the tissue level _PROTEIN_ of the gus gene under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter was examined in transgenic arabidopsis plants . _PROTEIN_ was widely _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis tissues at different developmental stages . in light grown seedlings cotyledons hypocotyl and roots were stained . the basal portion of the hypocotyl was more stained than the apical portion . roots were generally stained including the vasculature root hairs and other root cells but not the root tip . in day old dark grown seedlings staining was throughout the seedlings in day old dark grown seedlings the upper portion of hypocotyl was strongly stained . strong _PROTEIN_ promoter activity was found in young rosette leaves and _PROTEIN_ as the leaf matured . stomata trichomes and trichome basal cells displayed gus staining . staining diminished from the midvein region in older leaves and persisted in the hydathodes . all staining disappeared in old and senescent leaves . young _METHOD_ flowers and elongating siliques also exhibited strong _PROTEIN_ promoter activity . in addition to styles gus staining was found in vascular tissues of sepals _PROTEIN_ and stamens but not pollen . in older siliques _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was restricted to seeds but not seed pods . from the above _PROTEIN_ promoter activity was tissue specific and developmentally regulated vascular tissues and styles as well as young organs _METHOD_ were preferentially stained by gus . in addition to northern blotting and gus analysis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was also examined by accessing publicly available microarray data at genevestigator . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was detected in cell suspension cultures and a variety of plant tissues and organs in microarray experiments with affymetrix genechips k _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . moreover tissue comparison experiments using cdna _PROTEIN_ detected times more _PROTEIN_ transcript in flowers relative to leaves . the abundance of the _PROTEIN_ transcript in vascular tissues as revealed by the promoter gus analysis was also corroborated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ data in arabidopsis roots from the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ database . in addition to high _PROTEIN_ in the root vasculature _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was detected in other root tissues such as endodermis cortex and epidermis . another approach to analyze gene _PROTEIN_ is signature _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was the only lys rich _PROTEIN_ whose _PROTEIN_ was detected by _PROTEIN_ in callus . its transcript levels were high in inflorescence and siliques and moderate in roots and leaves . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels in arabidopsis treated with various abiotic and biotic stress were also examined . some abiotic treatment microarray data were summarized at arabidopsis _LOCATION_ protein library . _PROTEIN_ transcript levels _PROTEIN_ in the presence of cold osmotic and uv stress but not wounding . _PROTEIN_ data in biotic stress experiments were found via tair microarray _PROTEIN_ search _PROTEIN_ and manually analyzed . _PROTEIN_ signals were downregulated by aba upregulated by brassinosteroid and did not significantly change in response to other hormones . suppression of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by aba was corroborated by northern blot analysis . pathogen mediated regulation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was also examined . _PROTEIN_ transcription was significantly suppressed by the bacterial pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv . tomato but not by a nonpathogenic mutant version pst hrcc that had a mutation in the hrcc gene . two databases the a. thaliana co response database and the arabidopsis thaliana trans _PROTEIN_ and cis element prediction database were used to examine genes co _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ . both databases showed that _PROTEIN_ was co regulated with genes belonging to various families including those involved in cell wall biosynthesis hormone pathways and signaling . a list of the top genes that showed highest _PROTEIN_ correlation with _PROTEIN_ from both websites is provided in supplemental table . _PROTEIN_ was also co _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ as well as other _PROTEIN_ genes such as and _PROTEIN_ . interestingly some glycosyltransferases were observed to be co _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ leading to the speculation that _PROTEIN_ is the acceptor substrate for these glycosyltransferases . co regulation of _PROTEIN_ with other genes however needs to be pursued more completely to understand the significance . before peptide injection rabbit preimmune sera were screened and two rabbits with the lowest immune responses to arabidopsis total leaf proteins were chosen for production of the antibody . the purified anti _PROTEIN_ peptide antibody was tested for its specificity . when synthetic peptides corresponding to lys rich regions of _PROTEIN_ and were used in dot blotting the _PROTEIN_ antibody did not recognize the _PROTEIN_ and peptides but exhibited strong reactivity against the _PROTEIN_ peptide . additionally the _PROTEIN_ antibody did not react with the purified _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein . these results indicated that the _PROTEIN_ antibody was specific towards the targeted peptide and in particular did not show detectable cross reactivity with _PROTEIN_ . organ specific _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was obtained with western blotting using the purified anti _PROTEIN_ peptide antibody against total protein preparations . _PROTEIN_ protein levels were highest in roots and flowers followed by _METHOD_ and seedlings . low abundance of _PROTEIN_ protein was found in siliques and rosette leaves . in order to localize _PROTEIN_ at the cellular level a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was _PROTEIN_ in transgenic tobacco by cells under the control of the s camv promoter . _METHOD_ was inserted between the signal sequence and the rest of _PROTEIN_ coding sequences . while wt by cells showed no background _METHOD_ green _METHOD_ was observed on the surfaces of transgenic by cells . when cells were plasmolyzed with nacl for min green _METHOD_ was localized to both the pm and hechtian strands . the above results indicated that _PROTEIN_ was localized to the pm presumably via a gpi lipid anchor and in hechtian strands adhesion sites between the pm and cell wall . to confirm the pm localization of _PROTEIN_ biochemical two phase fractionation and western blotting were employed . two phases were obtained from by cells _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein one phase contained purified pm and the other phase was depleted of pm . equal amounts of proteins from the two fractions were used for western blotting and the _METHOD_ antibody revealed the majority of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the purified pm fraction but not in the fraction depleted of pm indicating that _PROTEIN_ was indeed present on the pm .
