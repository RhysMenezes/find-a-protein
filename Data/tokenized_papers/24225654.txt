the recognition of pathogen effector proteins by plants is typically mediated by intracellular receptors belonging to the nucleotide binding leucine rich repeat family . nlr proteins often detect pathogen effector proteins indirectly by detecting modification of their targets . how nlr proteins detect such modifications is poorly understood . to address these questions we have been investigating the arabidopsis nlr protein resistance to pseudomonas _PROTEIN_ which detects the pseudomonas syringae effector protein avirulence protein pseudomonas phaseolicolab . avrpphb is a cysteine protease that specifically targets a subfamily of receptor like cytoplasmic kinases including the arabidopsis protein kinase avrpphb _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is activated by the cleavage of _PROTEIN_ at the apex of its activation loop . here we show that _PROTEIN_ activation requires that _PROTEIN_ be localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and that _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ is mediated by amino terminal s acylation . we also describe the development of a high throughput screen for mutations in _PROTEIN_ that block _PROTEIN_ activation which uncovered four new _PROTEIN_ alleles two of which blocked cleavage by avrpphb . lastly we show that _PROTEIN_ distinguishes among closely related kinases by the amino acid sequence _PROTEIN_ within an exposed loop in the c terminal one third of _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ loop is located on the opposite side of _PROTEIN_ from the avrpphb cleavage site suggesting that _PROTEIN_ associates with the _PROTEIN_ loop while leaving the avrpphb cleavage site exposed . these findings provide support for a model of nlr activation in which nlr proteins form a preactivation complex with effector targets and then sense a conformational change in the target induced by effector modification .
_PROTEIN_ contains a predicted n terminal s acylation signal with both cys and cys residues predicted to be palmitoylated by css palm . consistent with this prediction a previous study showed that fusion of the first amino acids of _PROTEIN_ to _METHOD_ causes _METHOD_ to localize to the pm . however this work did not address whether full length _PROTEIN_ localizes to the pm nor whether cys and/or cys are required for pm localization . in this study we fused super yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ to the c terminus of full length _PROTEIN_ . laser scanning confocal microscopy imaging demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localizes to the pm when _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana epidermal cells . palmitoylation is usually associated with myristoylation at gly so we created _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion to investigate their respective contribution to _PROTEIN_ localization . the _PROTEIN_ mutation did not cause a significant change in _PROTEIN_ localization . however the _PROTEIN_ mutation caused significant dissociation of _PROTEIN_ from the pm . on the other hand the kinase activity of _PROTEIN_ appears not to be necessary for _PROTEIN_ pm localization as the kinase inactive _PROTEIN_ still showed a typical peripheral pm localization profile . to further map the pm localization signal we fused the first amino acids of _PROTEIN_ to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ in n. benthamiana revealed a pm localization profile . in addition to the pm signal we observed highly mobile vesicle like structures . such structures are frequently observed when acylated proteins are overexpressed . a _PROTEIN_ mutant form of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ accumulated in the cytoplasm instead of pm indicating that one or more of these residues is required for pm localization . to determine whether the cys and cys residues of _PROTEIN_ are modified through thioester linkage to acyl groups we assessed protein acylation using a biotin switch assay . this method uses hydroxylamine induced cleavage of thioester bonds which results in free sulfhydryl groups that can then be conjugated to a biotin derivative biotin bmcc . _METHOD_ transiently _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana was immunoprecipitated and suspended in n ethylmaleimide to block any free nonacylated cys residues treated with hydroxylamine to cleave thioester bonds and incubated with biotin bmcc to label newly exposed sulfhydryl groups followed by immunoblot analysis with streptavidin to detect any fatty acid modifications . the _METHOD_ fusion was successfully labeled with biotin while _METHOD_ with the _PROTEIN_ mutation was not indicating that the cys and/or cys residues of _PROTEIN_ are acylated . to confirm that _PROTEIN_ can be acylated with palmitic acid we performed in vivo labeling of full length _PROTEIN_ in yeast with tritium labeled palmitic acid . wild type _PROTEIN_ was labeled while the _PROTEIN_ mutant was not . we have previously shown that _PROTEIN_ can be activated by simultaneous _PROTEIN_ of the two engineered _PROTEIN_ cleavage products which recapitulates avrpphb cleavage . knowledge of the subcellular localization of these two products would thus be helpful for understanding how _PROTEIN_ is activated . we generated c terminal fusions for both the n terminal _PROTEIN_ cleavage product _METHOD_ and the c terminal _PROTEIN_ cleavage product _METHOD_ . confocal microscopy imaging revealed a pm localization profile for _METHOD_ but a _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ localization pattern for _METHOD_ . however the presence of both _PROTEIN_ cleavage products is necessary for _PROTEIN_ activation and pm localization of _PROTEIN_ is essential for its activation suggesting that there must be a subpopulation of localized to the pm perhaps via intra _PROTEIN_ contacts . to test this hypothesis we performed bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation on the two _PROTEIN_ cleavage products . for this purpose we generated _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ constructs . coexpression of these two constructs in n. benthamiana produced a strong bifc signal on the pm . as a negative control we coexpressed _METHOD_ with hemagglutinin _METHOD_ which produced no bifc signal . the interaction of and in this bifc assay is consistent with our previous observation that the two engineered cleavage products interact with each other in coimmunoprecipitation assays . taken together these data indicate that the two halves of _PROTEIN_ remain associated on the pm following cleavage by avrpphb . to investigate the importance of _PROTEIN_ acylation in _PROTEIN_ mediated resistance we generated transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ wild type _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ mutant and the _PROTEIN_ mutant under the control of the native _PROTEIN_ promoter in a _PROTEIN_ mutant background . to facilitate subsequent analyses all constructs were tagged with a c terminal ha epitope . similar to plants _PROTEIN_ wild type _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transformants showed a strong hr when infiltrated with p. syringae strain at h after inoculation . in contrast both the _PROTEIN_ mutant and the empty vector control failed to complement the _PROTEIN_ mutation producing no visible hr indicating that the substitutions in _PROTEIN_ blocked the activation of _PROTEIN_ . we confirmed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ failed to activate _PROTEIN_ by measuring bacterial growth . consistent with the hr data the growth of in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants was indistinguishable from that observed in _PROTEIN_ control plants transformed with the empty vector and approximately fold higher than in plants transformed with wild type _PROTEIN_ . furthermore the growth of in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants was similar to that of lacking avrpphb . taken together we conclude that the localization of _PROTEIN_ to the pm via cys and/or cys acylation is essential for the activation of _PROTEIN_ by . avrpphb has previously been shown to localize to the pm via n terminal acylation . one possible explanation for the failure of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to complement the _PROTEIN_ mutation is that _PROTEIN_ must be associated with the pm to be cleaved by avrpphb . to test this hypothesis we injected into transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ wild type _PROTEIN_ ha or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ha and assessed _PROTEIN_ cleavage using immunoblot analysis . at h post injection the c terminal _PROTEIN_ cleavage product was detected in extract from wild type _PROTEIN_ ha tissue . in contrast no _PROTEIN_ cleavage was detected in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ha tissue injected with or in wild type _PROTEIN_ ha tissue injected with lacking avrpphb . in addition _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ accumulated to a level similar to that of wild type _PROTEIN_ indicating that the failure of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to complement _PROTEIN_ was not due to poor protein accumulation . to investigate whether the inhibition of _PROTEIN_ cleavage by the _PROTEIN_ mutation was because of structural constraints or the lack of colocalization we introduced the _PROTEIN_ mutation into avrpphb which has been shown to dissociate avrpphb from the pm . the simultaneous overexpression of _PROTEIN_ avrpphb and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana resulted in _PROTEIN_ cleavage while coexpression with _PROTEIN_ did not indicating that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ remains a functional substrate for avrpphb . taken together the _PROTEIN_ mutation inhibits _PROTEIN_ cleavage by avrpphb by causing _PROTEIN_ to localize to a different subcellular compartment from avrpphb rather than by causing a structural change in _PROTEIN_ . to further investigate the structural requirements for the activation of _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ cleavage we designed an ethyl methanesulfonate _METHOD_ induced mutation screen that enabled us to select for mutations in the native _PROTEIN_ gene . for this screen we generated a transgenic arabidopsis line that contained avrpphb under the control of an estradiol inducible promoter which enabled us to activate _PROTEIN_ by germinating seedlings on agarose plates containing estradiol leading to their death . to avoid obtaining mutations in _PROTEIN_ we employed a transgenic arabidopsis line that contained at least two copies of an _PROTEIN_ transgene reasoning that it would be highly unlikely for _METHOD_ to simultaneously inactivate multiple copies . from this screen we expected to uncover mutations in _PROTEIN_ that either blocked the cleavage of _PROTEIN_ by avrpphb or blocked the recognition of cleavage by _PROTEIN_ . we also expected to uncover mutations in genes required for _PROTEIN_ mediated cell death that functioned downstream of _PROTEIN_ activation . we named the above transgenic line for estradiol inducible avrpphb containing multiple _PROTEIN_ genes . there were no morphological differences between and wild type columbia plants grown in soil . in addition in the absence of estradiol induction the growth of virulent p. syringae strain or avirulent in plants was indistinguishable from that in wild type col plants . these data indicate that immune responses are not being activated in plants prior to induction of the avrpphb transgene . as shown in supplemental figure spraying estradiol on plants induced _METHOD_ cell death by h post induction . this response was dependent on _PROTEIN_ as a transgenic line containing the same estradiol inducible avrpphb transgene in an _PROTEIN_ mutant background remained green and healthy after estradiol induction . we mutagenized seeds with _METHOD_ and then screened seeds on agar plates for mutants that germinated in the presence of estradiol . we screened approximately seeds divided into pools representing approximately parents each . from this screen we obtained estradiol resistant mutants . to confirm that we were not obtaining _PROTEIN_ mutants we sequenced _PROTEIN_ from the first seven mutants isolated from five pools none had mutations in _PROTEIN_ . seventeen of the mutants were sterile thus mutants from pools were propagated to the generation . eighteen of the families were found to lack the avrpphb transgene and were discarded . the remaining mutants were tested in the generation for the induction of hr following inoculation with p. syringae . nineteen of these lines induced a strong hr suggesting that these lines contained mutations in the avrpphb transgene system that reduced avrpphb _PROTEIN_ or function . indeed seven of these lines were found to contain mutations within avrpphb . the remaining families all displayed a compromised hr in response to p. syringae making these likely candidates for containing mutations in _PROTEIN_ . sequencing of _PROTEIN_ in these mutants revealed that five contained mutations in _PROTEIN_ with two of these being identical mutations isolated from the same pool likely representing siblings . the four new _PROTEIN_ mutant alleles were named _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ alleles have been described previously . all four new alleles contained missense mutations located within the kinase domain of _PROTEIN_ . to confirm that these mutations blocked the recognition of p. syringae _PROTEIN_ avrpphb we inoculated them with p. syringae strain at a density of colony forming units and scored for induction of an hr . as shown in figure none of the _PROTEIN_ mutants produced an hr while the parent did . to quantify the level of resistance in the _PROTEIN_ mutants we performed in planta bacterial growth assays . the growth of in the four new _PROTEIN_ mutants was similar to that in _PROTEIN_ and was approximately fold higher than in the parent indicating that all four _PROTEIN_ alleles eliminate avrpphb recognition . mutations in _PROTEIN_ could block the activation of _PROTEIN_ by several different _METHOD_ including destabilizing the _PROTEIN_ protein blocking cleavage by avrpphb eliminating kinase activity and/or blocking the association with _PROTEIN_ . to assess whether any of the mutations affected stability and/or cleavage by avrpphb we transiently coexpressed the _PROTEIN_ mutants with avrpphb in n. benthamiana and performed immunoblot analyses . the _PROTEIN_ substitution _PROTEIN_ appeared to destabilize _PROTEIN_ as it accumulated poorly . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ substitutions accumulated to levels slightly less than wild type _PROTEIN_ . the and substitutions did not affect cleavage by avrpphb while the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ substitutions appeared to completely block cleavage . the substitution is located in the p loop of _PROTEIN_ and is thus expected to eliminate _PROTEIN_ binding and kinase activity which likely accounts for its failure to activate _PROTEIN_ . the substitution is located immediately c terminal of the cleavage site and thus may affect cleavage when avrpphb is delivered from p. syringae . why _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ block cleavage is unclear but this observation suggests that these mutations are disrupting the overall structure of _PROTEIN_ which is plausible given that each substitution causes the introduction of a charged side chain in place of no side chain . to gain further insight into the structural basis of _PROTEIN_ recognition by _PROTEIN_ we compared the amino acid sequence of _PROTEIN_ with those of closely related members of the receptor like cytoplasmic kinase family that are not recognized by _PROTEIN_ . the arabidopsis genome contains _PROTEIN_ like _PROTEIN_ proteins with the most similar _PROTEIN_ being identical and similar across the kinase domain . to assess whether _PROTEIN_ were distinguished based on their ability to be cleaved by avrpphb we cloned the five _PROTEIN_ proteins most similar to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ along with one of the most dissimilar _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and tested for cleavage by avrpphb using transient coexpression in n. benthamiana . four of the _PROTEIN_ proteins appeared to be cleaved based on the disappearance of the full length protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but only _PROTEIN_ consistently produced a detectable cleavage product . the lack of a detectable cleavage product in the other three suggests that the cleavage products are rapidly degraded following cleavage . these same _PROTEIN_ were also tested for their ability to activate _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana when coexpressed with avrpphb but none was able to do so . together these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ can distinguish among the _PROTEIN_ proteins independent of their ability to be cleaved by avrpphb . the high sequence similarity between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ suggested that _PROTEIN_ must distinguish between these two proteins based on a small number of amino acid differences . to narrow down the region conferring _PROTEIN_ specificity we took advantage of our finding that _PROTEIN_ can be activated in the absence of avrpphb by coexpression of engineered _PROTEIN_ cleavage products _PROTEIN_ . we reasoned that _PROTEIN_ specificity might lie in either the n terminal or c terminal half of _PROTEIN_ therefore we coexpressed the n terminal half of _PROTEIN_ with the c terminal half of _PROTEIN_ and vice versa and assessed whether _PROTEIN_ was activated . hr was observed when the _PROTEIN_ n terminus was combined with the _PROTEIN_ c terminus in the presence of _PROTEIN_ but not when the _PROTEIN_ c terminus was used . similar results were observed when using cleavage fragments from a _PROTEIN_ homolog from the moss physcomitrella patens which also has high sequence similarity to _PROTEIN_ . only the combination n terminus plus _PROTEIN_ c terminus could trigger _PROTEIN_ dependent hr . these findings indicate that the specificity for _PROTEIN_ lies within the c terminal half of _PROTEIN_ . sequence alignment of the kinase domains from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and revealed a five amino acid motif in the c terminal half of the kinase domain that is different in and _PROTEIN_ compared with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . inspection of the entire arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ family shown in supplemental figure confirmed that _PROTEIN_ is unique to _PROTEIN_ . to test if this motif is necessary for _PROTEIN_ triggered hr we made reciprocal exchanges of the _PROTEIN_ and narap motifs between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and coexpressed the wild type and mutated proteins together with avrpphb and _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana . the sequence change in _PROTEIN_ resulted in a loss of hr while the introduction of the _PROTEIN_ motif into _PROTEIN_ enabled _PROTEIN_ triggered hr . to exclude the possibility that avrpphb does not cleave the mutated _PROTEIN_ protein immunoblot analysis was performed . all proteins were cleaved by avrpphb . the _PROTEIN_ motif is thus a key specificity determinant that enables _PROTEIN_ to distinguish _PROTEIN_ from closely related kinases . to gain further insight into the _PROTEIN_ motif we mapped this sequence onto the predicted structure of _PROTEIN_ . significantly _PROTEIN_ resides on an exposed loop of _PROTEIN_ . this loop is located on the opposite side of the _PROTEIN_ kinase domain from the cleavage site which suggests that _PROTEIN_ may be detecting _PROTEIN_ cleavage by sensing the movement of the _PROTEIN_ motif following cleavage .
