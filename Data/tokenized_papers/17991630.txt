xylan cellulose and lignin are the three major components of secondary walls in wood and elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway of xylan is of importance for potential modification of secondary wall composition to produce wood with improved properties . so far three arabidopsis glycosyltransferases fragile _PROTEIN_ irregular and irregular have been implicated in _PROTEIN_ biosynthesis . in this study we demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ which is a member of family _PROTEIN_ is required for the biosynthesis of the tetrasaccharide primer sequence d xyl l rha d gala d xyl located at the reducing end of gx . the _PROTEIN_ gene is _PROTEIN_ during secondary wall biosynthesis in fibers and vessels and its encoded protein is predominantly localized in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . mutation of the _PROTEIN_ gene leads to a drastic reduction in secondary wall _PROTEIN_ and gx content . structural analysis of gx using _LOCATION_ magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed that the _PROTEIN_ mutation causes a loss of the tetrasaccharide primer sequence at the reducing end of gx and an absence of _PROTEIN_ acid side chains in gx . activity assay showed that the xylan xylosyltransferase and _PROTEIN_ activities were not affected in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . together these findings implicate a possible role for _PROTEIN_ in the initiation of biosynthesis of the gx tetrasaccharide primer sequence and provide novel insights into the _METHOD_ of gx biosynthesis .
the interfascicular fibers of arabidopsis inflorescence _METHOD_ deposit a large amount of cellulose xylan and lignin in secondary walls which have been used as a model for studying genes involved in secondary wall biosynthesis . to find genes responsible for xylan biosynthesis we analyzed _PROTEIN_ that were up regulated during secondary wall _PROTEIN_ using interfascicular fibers isolated by laser microdissection . in this report we studied the function of a putative _PROTEIN_ gene _GENE_ which was induced during secondary wall _PROTEIN_ of fibers . the _GENE_ gene is a member of _PROTEIN_ family and was previously named _PROTEIN_ and proposed to be involved in pectin biosynthesis . we have found that the _PROTEIN_ gene is highly _PROTEIN_ in fibers and xylem cells undergoing secondary wall _PROTEIN_ but not in parenchymatous pith cells . at the organ level the _PROTEIN_ gene is predominantly _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ in which abundant secondary wall containing fibers and xylem cells are produced . in addition the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene was shown to be co induced with three known xylan biosynthetic genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ by overexpression of _PROTEIN_ which results in ectopic deposition of secondary walls . moreover its _PROTEIN_ was down regulated together with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ rna interference lines which exhibit a loss of secondary wall _PROTEIN_ in fiber cells . therefore we reasoned that _PROTEIN_ is likely to be involved in the biosynthesis of a secondary wall component such as gx rather than pectin as previously proposed . we next performed in situ mrna localization to investigate the developmental _PROTEIN_ pattern of the _PROTEIN_ gene in arabidopsis _METHOD_ and roots . in rapidly elongating internodes in which protoxylem is the only secondary wall containing tissue present the _PROTEIN_ mrna signal was seen in the developing vessels of the protoxylem . at this stage interfascicular fiber cells are undergoing rapid elongation and no secondary wall _PROTEIN_ is evident . concomitantly no _PROTEIN_ mrna signal was seen in interfascicular fiber cells . in non elongating internodes in which secondary wall _PROTEIN_ is evident in interfascicular fibers a strong _PROTEIN_ mrna signal was detected in interfascicular fiber cells in addition to developing vessels and xylary fibers in metaxylem . the _PROTEIN_ mrna signal was also observed in developing vessels and xylary fibers in secondary xylem of roots . the control stem section hybridized with the sense _PROTEIN_ rna probe did not show any positive signals . these results demonstrate that the _PROTEIN_ gene is specifically _PROTEIN_ in cells undergoing secondary wall _PROTEIN_ including interfascicular fibers vessels and xylary fibers . the secondary wall associated _PROTEIN_ pattern of the _PROTEIN_ gene revealed in this study differs from that reported in a previous study which employed the promoter _PROTEIN_ reporter gene analysis and showed its _PROTEIN_ in almost all cell types in _METHOD_ . it is apparent that the promoter used in the _PROTEIN_ study lacks some regulatory elements required for the endogenous gene _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ protein is predicted to have a hydrophobic signal peptide sequence at the n terminus by both protein hydropathy analysis and the prediction of protein sorting signals and localization sites program _METHOD_ . to examine the subcellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein we co _PROTEIN_ yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ with a cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged _LOCATION_ marker and a _LOCATION_ marker in carrot protoplasts and studied their co localization patterns . it was found that the _METHOD_ signals of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ displayed a network like pattern which clearly overlapped with the localization pattern of the _LOCATION_ marker . in contrast the network like signals of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ displayed apparent differences from the punctate localization pattern of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ that is known to be localized in the _LOCATION_ although some overlap of signals was observed . the control protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ alone had _METHOD_ signals distributed throughout the cytoplasm . these results indicate that the _PROTEIN_ protein is predominantly associated with the _LOCATION_ . the finding that the _PROTEIN_ gene is specifically _PROTEIN_ in cells undergoing secondary wall _PROTEIN_ suggests that it is likely to be involved in secondary wall biosynthesis . to find out whether the _PROTEIN_ gene is essential for secondary wall _PROTEIN_ we obtained a homozygous t dna insertion knockout line of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ for examination of stem strength and wall _PROTEIN_ of fibers and vessels . the homozygous t dna knockout plants were smaller in rosette size and their _METHOD_ exhibited a dwarf phenotype which is identical to the previously reported observations for _PROTEIN_ mutations . it was found that mutation of the _PROTEIN_ gene led to a severe reduction in the mechanical strength of _METHOD_ compared with the wild type . examination of fibers and vessels in _METHOD_ and roots revealed that the wall _PROTEIN_ of fibers and vessels in the _PROTEIN_ mutant was drastically _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type . it was apparent that the vessels in the _PROTEIN_ mutant exhibited a collapsed phenotype which is most probably caused by the reduced wall strength as observed in other known secondary wall defective mutants . transmission electron microscopy showed that the wall _PROTEIN_ of interfascicular fibers vessels and xylary fibers was reduced by compared with the wild type . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is required for normal secondary wall _PROTEIN_ in both fibers and vessels . the observation that _PROTEIN_ is associated with the _LOCATION_ indicates that it is involved in the biosynthesis of a non cellulosic polysaccharide . because the major non cellulosic polysaccharide in secondary walls of arabidopsis fibers and vessels is gx we postulate that _PROTEIN_ might play a role in gx biosynthesis . to investigate which secondary wall components are affected by the _PROTEIN_ mutation we first analyzed the composition of total cell walls isolated from _METHOD_ and found that the amount of xylose and _PROTEIN_ which are the respective _PROTEIN_ components of gx and cellulose was reduced by and respectively compared with the wild type . no significant alterations were seen in the amount of other cell wall neutral sugars including mannose galactose arabinose rhamnose and fucose . further composition analysis of and n koh extracts of cell walls from _METHOD_ of wild type and _PROTEIN_ showed that the most drastically reduced sugar content was xylose . because the xylose in and n koh extracts of arabidopsis _METHOD_ comes primarily from gx these findings strongly suggest that _PROTEIN_ is involved in gx biosynthesis . the reduction in cellulose content in the _PROTEIN_ mutant is probably due to an indirect effect which has also been observed in three other known xylan deficient mutants . the _PROTEIN_ mutation has previously been shown to reduce the xylose content in leaf cell walls which was attributed to an indirect effect due to its presumed role in pectin biosynthesis . because _PROTEIN_ is a _PROTEIN_ believed to be involved in polysaccharide synthesis but is unlikely to be involved in lignin synthesis we did not analyze the possible effect of its mutation on lignin alterations . to substantiate the role of _PROTEIN_ in gx biosynthesis we next examined the effect of the _PROTEIN_ mutation on gx deposition by immunolocalization using monoclonal antibody that binds to o methylglucuronoxylan _PROTEIN_ . immunolabeling of wild type stem and root sections showed intensive _METHOD_ signals in the walls of interfascicular fibers and xylem cells including vessels and xylary fibers all of which are known to contain abundant gx in secondary walls . in contrast almost no _METHOD_ signals were observed in the secondary wall containing tissues in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and roots . _PROTEIN_ of the wild type _PROTEIN_ gene in the _PROTEIN_ mutant restored the xylan signals to the wild type level in all secondary wall containing tissues in _METHOD_ and roots . these results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is required for the normal biosynthesis and deposition of gx in secondary walls of fibers and vessels . to determine whether mutation of the _PROTEIN_ gene affects the gx structure the koh solubilized gx from _METHOD_ of wild type and the _PROTEIN_ mutant was digested with endoxylanase and the acidic xylooligosaccharides produced by the digestion were analyzed by _PROTEIN_ assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . maldi tof _METHOD_ of the wild type acidic xylooligosacchrides revealed two major ion peaks at _METHOD_ to charge ratios of and which are attributed to xylooligosaccharides with four xyl residues substituted with one non methylated d glca or one o me d glca respectively . the xylooligosaccharides bearing o me d glca side chains are more abundant than those bearing d glca side chains which is a typical pattern observed in the gx of wild type arabidopsis . in contrast the maldi tof spectrum of _PROTEIN_ acidic xylooligosacchrides contains only the ion peak at an m/z of . the _PROTEIN_ mutant lacked the ion with an m/z of that is attributed to xylotetrasaccharides substituted with one non methylated d glca . the maldi tof analysis demonstrates that the _PROTEIN_ mutation results in a loss of d glca side chains in gx . the arabidopsis gx contains a tetrasaccharide primer sequence located at the reducing end which differs from the gx backbone . a previous study showed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are required for the biosynthesis of this tetrasaccharide primer sequence . to investigate further the roles of _PROTEIN_ in gx biosynthesis we examined whether the _PROTEIN_ mutation affects the biosynthesis of the tetrasaccharide primer sequence using _LOCATION_ magnetic resonance _METHOD_ . the nmr spectrum of wild type acidic xylooligosaccharides contained anomeric resonances of and of d glca and of branched d xyl residues bearing an d glca residue as well as and of o me d glca residues and of branched d xyl residues bearing a o me d glca residue . the spectrum also includes resonances of of xyl and xyl residues at the reducing ends of oligoxylosaccharides and of unbranched xyl residues . furthermore the resonances assigned to the tetrasaccharide primer sequence d xyl l rha d gala d xyl that is located at the reducing end of gx was apparent in the spectrum of wild type acidic xylooligosaccharides . these resonances include of d gala of l rha of linked d xyl of d gala and of l rha . the observed nmr spectrum of wild type acidic xylooligosaccharides is the same as that previously reported for wild type arabidopsis acidic xylooligosaccharides . examination of the nmr spectrum of _PROTEIN_ acidic xylooligosaccharides showed an apparent lack of resonances of of d gala of l rha of linked d xyl of d gala and of l rha which are assigned to the tetrasaccharide primer sequence d xyl l rha d gala d xyl that is located at the reducing end of gx . in addition the resonances assigned to and of d glca and of branched d xyl residues bearing an d glca residue were absent in _PROTEIN_ which is consistent with the maldi tof data . these results demonstrate that the _PROTEIN_ mutation leads to a loss of the tetrasaccharide primer sequence at the gx reducing end which suggests that _PROTEIN_ is involved in the biosynthesis of the tetrasaccharide primer sequence . to investigate whether the reduced gx content and altered gx structure were caused by a reduction in _PROTEIN_ or glcat activities we performed comparative analysis of their activities using microsomes isolated from wild type and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . it was found that there was no _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ and glcat activities in the _PROTEIN_ mutant instead they were elevated compared with the wild type . the elevation of _PROTEIN_ and glcat activities was also observed in three other xylan deficient mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ probably due to a compensatory effect caused by these mutations . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is not required for the normal activities of xylan _PROTEIN_ and glcat .
