screening of plant genes with growth suppression effect inhibited by atbi is an antiapoptotic _PROTEIN_ that can inhibit bax induced cell death in mammalian plant and yeast cells . to screen plant genes that can induce bax like cell death we utilized the yeast system . wild type yeast strain harboring atbi which produces atbi under the control of galactose inducible _PROTEIN_ promoter was transformed with the arabidopsis cdna library _PROTEIN_ and plated on the sd galactose medium . to obtain clones that were growth inhibited on _PROTEIN_ containing medium these transformants were duplicated onto the sd _PROTEIN_ plate . after days of incubation at clones that survived on galactose containing medium but were growth inhibited on the _PROTEIN_ medium were picked up . plasmids were isolated from the candidate clones followed by dna sequencing . through successive screening of transformants a single clone containing arabidopsis cdna was isolated and named _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we found two more possible cdf homologues in the arabidopsis genome _GENE_ and . as shown in fig . cdf related genes were conserved in plant species . the _PROTEIN_ encoded a polypeptide of amino acids and had an estimated molecular _METHOD_ of kda . the _PROTEIN_ protein showed sequence homology to _GENE_ _GENE_ and synechocystis . these proteins have no reported homology with any known animal protein and do not contain any recognizable protein motifs . hydrophobicity analysis revealed that _PROTEIN_ and contained three transmembrane domains whereas other cdf related proteins including synechocystis and _GENE_ possessed four transmembrane domains . _PROTEIN_ induces yeast cell death in a bax like confirm the activity of _PROTEIN_ as a cell growth suppressor isolated cdna was connected under the _PROTEIN_ promoter and plasmid pts _PROTEIN_ was constructed . yeast strains transformed with pts pts _PROTEIN_ and pts bax were cultured in sd _PROTEIN_ medium for day and subjected to the spot assay . _PROTEIN_ showed yeast growth inhibitory effects . to clarify the intracellular localization of _PROTEIN_ protein in yeast a plasmid containing _PROTEIN_ fused to the n terminus of _METHOD_ was constructed . the yeast cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ demonstrated similar growth defect as those _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ alone . after h of culture in the sd galactose liquid medium yeast cells _PROTEIN_ both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and mt _METHOD_ were collected and observed under a _METHOD_ microscope . as shown in fig . the _METHOD_ signals of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and mt _METHOD_ were co localized and showed punctate structures . to make clear the mitochondrial shape in yeast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ yeast cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and mt _METHOD_ were also observed under a _METHOD_ microscope . as shown in fig . without _PROTEIN_ or bax _PROTEIN_ the mitochondria kept an elongated shape . on the other hand _PROTEIN_ or bax caused dramatic morphological change in mitochondria . we then visualized functional mitochondria with a transmembrane potential using mitotracker red a vital mitochondrial _METHOD_ probe . in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ yeast cells mitotracker red clearly stained active elongated mitochondria . in contrast the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ caused the loss of mitochondrial _LOCATION_ potential _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . to detect ros generation dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate was used . this reagent diffuses through cell _LOCATION_ and is subsequently enzymatically deacetylated by intracellular esterases to the non _METHOD_ molecules then it is oxidized by ros to the highly _METHOD_ dichlorofluorescein . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ induced growth defect in yeast is also accompanied by ros generation _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ yeast cells cultured in sd galactose medium were stained with dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate . as shown in fig . b and c _METHOD_ was noted in of cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or bax after h of culture . the majority of cells of the control strain with an empty vector showed no _METHOD_ . as shown in fig . the ros generation preceded dead cell stimulation . electron microscopic examination of _PROTEIN_ and bax _PROTEIN_ cells revealed extensive disorganization of intracellular structures . numerous cells showed morphological change of _LOCATION_ accumulation of autophagic bodies and increased intracellular vacuolization . in contrast intracellular structures of control cells possessing empty vector were homogenous in shape and cytoplasmic electron density . bi suppresses _PROTEIN_ induced a first step toward determining the role played by this protein we tested whether the mammalian bcl and plant bi genes could suppress the _PROTEIN_ induced growth defect in yeast . the _PROTEIN_ plasmids containing bcl atbi and osbi were transformed into a yeast strain containing galactose inducible _PROTEIN_ plasmid _PROTEIN_ . as shown in fig . when plated on the galactose medium the cells transformed with atbi and osbi demonstrated partial recovery of cell growth whereas the cells transformed with empty vector and bcl did not . as shown in fig . atbi suppressed the cell death caused by _PROTEIN_ or bax _PROTEIN_ whereas the ros generation was not suppressed . furthermore bi suppressed the loss of mitochondrial _LOCATION_ potential as shown by the stainability with mitotracker red . in contrast morphological change of mitochondria was not prohibited by the bi _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ mediated lethality in bax resistant further analyze the _PROTEIN_ mediated yeast cell death bax resistant yeast strains _PROTEIN_ were used . an unknown genetic mutation in _PROTEIN_ results in resistance against bax induced lethality . it was also demonstrated that disruption of the _PROTEIN_ gene caused tolerance to bax . using these strains a growth assay was performed to clarify whether _PROTEIN_ and bax mediated effects are similar in _METHOD_ of the cell death inducer in yeast . wild type strains _PROTEIN_ and mutant strains were transformed with pts bax or pts _PROTEIN_ respectively . yeast cells cultured in sd _PROTEIN_ for day were transferred to the sd galactose medium for h and their growth was determined . as shown in fig . the _PROTEIN_ strain was resistant against both bax and _PROTEIN_ induced growth defect . in contrast the strain demonstrated tolerance against bax but sensitivity to _PROTEIN_ mediated effect . the same results were obtained by the evans blue staining method . _PROTEIN_ pattern of cdf gene in plant confirm the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in plants mrna accumulation was examined in several tissues obtained from week old arabidopsis plants . _PROTEIN_ showed higher _PROTEIN_ in the above ground parts . we then examined the possible involvement of this gene in the leaf senescence stage . leaf senescence is also known to be one of the stages of programmed cell death in plant species . northern blot analysis of total rnas isolated from mature and senescent leaves of week old plants showed enhanced _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the senescent leaves .
yeast strains and . cerevisiae strain _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was used in the present study . bax resistant mutant _PROTEIN_ and its wild type strains were kindly provided by dr. j. c. reed . to obtain the strain the _PROTEIN_ gene was disrupted in the strain by insertional mutagenesis . yeast strains were cultured in ypd or sd medium with appropriate supplements at . yeast transformation was performed by the lithium acetate method . screening of the arabidopsis cdna that causes growth defect in of the cdna library was based on the rescue of a growth defect in yeast by atbi gene which is a suppressor of bax mediated yeast lethality . the arabidopsis cdnas that cause yeast growth inhibition and whose effects are inhibited by atbi were identified . thus wild type yeast strain possessing galactose inducible atbi gene was transformed with arabidopsis cdna library _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and plated onto the sd galactose solid medium in which atbi is _PROTEIN_ . the transformants were replicated to a sd _PROTEIN_ plate to obtain a clone that survives on the galactose containing medium but not on _PROTEIN_ containing medium . the plasmid was recovered from each candidate clone and re introduced into a to confirm the reproducibility . the isolated cdna _PROTEIN_ was connected under the _PROTEIN_ promoter and the resultant plasmid pts _PROTEIN_ was used for further analysis . plasmid construction and spot coding regions of _PROTEIN_ and the mammalian apoptotic gene bax tagged with sphi recognition sequence using the pcr method were introduced into a sphi digested _PROTEIN_ vector _PROTEIN_ . for the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein the same fragment was cloned into the _METHOD_ plasmid . to _PROTEIN_ the mammalian anti apoptotic gene bcl the coding region tagged with the ecori recognition sequence was ligated to the ecori site of the _PROTEIN_ vector _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ vectors atbi and osbi used in this study have been described previously . the mouse bax and rat bcl genes were kindly provided by dr. j. c. reed . in the spot assay yeast cells grown in sd _PROTEIN_ medium for day were adjusted to of and diluted to various concentrations . the aliquot from each dilution was spotted onto sd _PROTEIN_ or sd galactose medium and incubated for days _PROTEIN_ or days at . cytological examination was conducted using a _METHOD_ microscope system . for the detection of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ yeast strains cultured in sd _PROTEIN_ medium for day were switched to sd galactose medium for h and examined at a nm excitation wavelength . the plasmids mt _METHOD_ and mt _METHOD_ used for the observation of mitochondrial morphology were kindly provided by dr. k. okamoto . to visualize active mitochondria with a transmembrane potential yeast cells were stained with the _METHOD_ probe mitotracker red for min and examined under a _METHOD_ microscope at a wavelength of nm . reactive oxygen species generation was monitored by treatment with dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate for min and observed under a _METHOD_ microscope . the number of viable cells was counted by the addition of evans blue which penetrates only dead cells and results in blue staining of the cellular contents . the percentage of dead cells under each treatment was determined by scoring several hundred cells under the microscope . for electron microscopic analysis yeast cells cultured on the sd galactose plate for days were fixed by the freeze substitution method treated with osmium tetraoxide and embedded in spurr 's resin . serial sections stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate were observed using the electron microscope . northern blot rnas were isolated from various tissues using the guanidinium thiocyanate method as described previously . total rnas electrophoresed on a denaturing agarose gel were transferred onto a nylon _LOCATION_ and then hybridized to the labeled untranslated region fragment of _PROTEIN_ in dextran sulfate m nacl _PROTEIN_ and heat denatured salmon testis dna . washing was performed under high stringency conditions _PROTEIN_ . the _LOCATION_ was analyzed with a _PROTEIN_ imaging plate scanner .
