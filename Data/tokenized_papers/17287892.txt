the vascular tissue of roots _METHOD_ essential roles in the physical support and transport of water nutrients and signaling molecules in higher plants . the molecular _METHOD_ underlying the function of root vascular tissue are poorly understood . in this study we analyzed the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ a salt stress responsive gene encoding a glycine rich protein and its interacting partner in arabidopsis thaliana . analysis of gus or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter showed that _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in the vascular tissue of the root subcellular localization analysis further demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ proteins were localized in the cell wall and in the cytoplasm . yeast two hybrid analysis revealed that _PROTEIN_ interacted with _PROTEIN_ a major cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase _PROTEIN_ involved in lignin biosynthesis for which tissue specific distribution was comparable with that of _PROTEIN_ . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ may be involved in lignin synthesis in response to salt stress as a result of its interaction with _PROTEIN_ in a. thaliana .
semi quantitative rt pcr was performed to analyze the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ in different organs of a. thaliana . as shown in fig . _PROTEIN_ was specifically _PROTEIN_ in the roots no transcript was found in the stem leaf or flower . to further investigate the tissue specific _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ driven by the _PROTEIN_ promoter was analyzed in transgenic a. thaliana plants . seedlings from three independent transgenic lines containing gus were used for analysis of promoter activity . in ten day old seedlings gus _PROTEIN_ was only detected in the root hair zone of the roots . no gus staining was observed in the leaves flowers or root tips . this result is consistent with that of rt pcr analysis . the cross section image from gus staining also showed that _PROTEIN_ promoter directed gus _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the vascular tissue of roots . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ view in the vertical section of the roots in the transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ resembled that of the gus staining . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected strongly in the region of the vascular tissue and no signal was observed in the central cells of the xylem . to further assess the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ we analyzed the distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins by _PROTEIN_ them transiently in epidermal onion cells using gold particle biolistics . because many glycine rich proteins are expected to be structural components of the plant cell wall _PROTEIN_ we first examined the _METHOD_ image under routine experimental conditions yet no obvious signal was observed in the cell wall . the reason for the absence of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins in the cell wall could be that the medium of low ph resulted in a _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ intensity in the cell wall . we therefore conducted the experiment under different conditions for observation of the cell wall proteins as described in materials and methods . as shown in fig . some of the _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins were localized in the cell wall whereas others were distributed in the _LOCATION_ . the unexpected _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ proteins might be a result of mis sorting of the fusion proteins because of use of a heterogeneous system and the strong promoter in the experiment . to identify potential _PROTEIN_ interacting proteins the _PROTEIN_ which contains no signal peptide was used as bait in a yeast two hybrid assay against the cdna library of a. thaliana seedlings . two positive clones were identified and one of them encodes for a cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase that was designated as _PROTEIN_ . as shown in fig . only clones containing both bait plasmid _PROTEIN_ and prey vector pgad _PROTEIN_ could grow on the selective plate compared with the negative and positive controls . the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was further demonstrated by the galactosidase colony lift filter assay . neither _PROTEIN_ nor _PROTEIN_ was found to be an auto activating protein in the yeast strain used for screening . we also observed that _PROTEIN_ was not a self interaction protein suggesting it was unable to assume a dimeric structure in the plant cell . these results indicated that _PROTEIN_ was a putative _PROTEIN_ interacting protein . the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ encouraged us to look at the relevance of their _PROTEIN_ pattern and subcellular localization . because it has been reported by sibout et al . that _PROTEIN_ was preferentially _PROTEIN_ in the roots and vascular tissue of a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ we _PROTEIN_ analyzed the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ . confocal microscopy analysis showed that although the free _METHOD_ proteins were distributed throughout the cell the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins were observed only at the cell periphery . because _PROTEIN_ was predicted to have three or four transmembrane helices a plasmolysis experiment was conducted to distinguish the residence of the proteins between cell wall and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . as shown in fig . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was perceptible _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ under routine experimental condition . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was however also observed in the cell wall if the sample was incubated under conditions for visualizing cell wall proteins . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signal also appeared in the hechtian strands between the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the cell wall . these results suggested that _PROTEIN_ may be a _LOCATION_ protein associated with the cell wall .
the columbia ecotype of a. thaliana was used for all experiments in this study . the seeds were cold treated at for days then sown in soil . the plants were grown in a greenhouse under a h h dark photoperiod at . transgenic plants were generated by agrobacterium mediated transformation using the floral dipping method . transgenic seedlings were selected on _METHOD_ agar plates containing kanamycin . total rna was prepared using the _PROTEIN_ reagent according to the manufacturer s instructions . superscript iii reverse transcriptase was used for first strand cdna synthesis with oligo and total rna template . the cdna products were subjected to pcr reaction with _PROTEIN_ specific primers . the primers used in pcr amplification were forward ttaacatactaagagagttattagaacttg and reverse _PROTEIN_ for the _PROTEIN_ gene and forward ttcctcaatctcatcttcttcc and reverse gacctgcctcatcatactcg for the gene . transcripts of the gene were amplified by cycles of pcr and those of the _PROTEIN_ gene were amplified by cycles of pcr . the kb dna fragment of the promoter region upstream of the translational start site was amplified from a. thaliana genomic dna by pcr . the pairs of primers used in the pcr reaction were forward ccctccaaagcttcatttgc reverse ttagtatgttaagtaagtgat . the dna fragment was cloned in the upstream of gus or _METHOD_ report gene and then subcloned into to create a recombinant transcription unit gus or _METHOD_ . the authenticity of the fusion constructs was confirmed by dna sequencing . plant transformation was conducted as described above . twenty and sixteen transgenics were generated for gus and _METHOD_ constructs respectively and three independent lines were chosen from each type of transgenic for gus staining or _METHOD_ _METHOD_ examination . histochemical staining for _PROTEIN_ activity in transformants was performed as described by jefferson et al . . for sectioning fixed and histochemically stained roots were dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol and infiltrated with historesin according to the manufacturer s procedure . sections of were cut on a vibratome then analyzed and photographed under an olympus dissection microscope equipped with a ccd camera . the transgenic _METHOD_ a. thaliana seedlings were grown for days on solid _METHOD_ medium . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed using a leica laser scanning confocal microscope with a nm excitation wavelength and an emission window of nm . the cdna fragment containing the open reading frame of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ was fused to the end of the _METHOD_ coding region and the fragments were subcloned into the _PROTEIN_ vector under the control of the camv promoter to obtain _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions . two _METHOD_ of the plasmid construct were used to coat gold particles and the plasmid containing _METHOD_ alone was used as a control . the onion inner layer of the epidermis was peeled and bombarded by a gene gun using the plasmid coated gold particles _PROTEIN_ . the bombarded samples were incubated at overnight under two different conditions . as conventional conditions the samples were placed on the _METHOD_ medium as alternative conditions to visualize _METHOD_ in the cell wall the bombarded samples were bathed in mmol piperazine n bis _PROTEIN_ koh . the reason was that the medium of low ph could result in a _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ intensity in the cell wall . in the plasmolysis experiment the bombarded onion epidermis was treated in mol mannitol and observed using a leica laser scanning confocal microscope . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was induced by excitation at nm with an argon laser . the a. thaliana whole plant cdna library was a generous gift from dr qi xie and constructed as described by xie et al . . yeast strains and were used for the assay . the screening was conducted by yeast mating method according to the matchmaker two hybrid system and libraries user manual . the interaction of empty vector and was used as negative control and the interaction of and t was used as positive control .
