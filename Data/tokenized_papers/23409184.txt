sterols are crucial lipid components that regulate _LOCATION_ permeability and fluidity and are the precursors of bioactive steroids . the plant sterols exist as three major _METHOD_ free sterols steryl glycosides and steryl esters . the storage of steryl esters in lipid droplets has been shown to contribute to cellular sterol homeostasis . to further document cellular aspects of sterol biosynthesis in plants we addressed the question of the subcellular localization of the enzymes implicated in the final steps of the post squalene biosynthetic pathway . in order to create a clear localization map of steroidogenic enzymes in cells the coding regions of sterol desaturase _PROTEIN_ sterol reductase _PROTEIN_ and sterol reductase were fused to the yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and transformed into arabidopsis thaliana mutant lines deficient in the corresponding enzymes . all fusion proteins were found to localize in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in functionally complemented plants . the results show that both sterol reductase and sterol reductase are in addition localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ whereas sterol desaturase was clearly detected in lipid particles . these findings raise new _PROTEIN_ questions about the spatial and dynamic cellular organization of sterol biosynthesis in plants .
the coding regions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis were cloned as c terminal translational fusions with the _METHOD_ reporter . in order to test whether the engineered enzymes were catalytically active these constructs were transformed into the appropriate yeast strains _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ in a wild type yeast and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in _LOCATION_ . it is well established that the enzymes involved in the _PROTEIN_ steps of the post squalene sterol biosynthetic segment are highly conserved among plants animals and fungi it has previously been shown that this allowed efficient reciprocal genetic complementation . for instance gachotte et al . and husselstein et al . reported the characterization of the _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis thaliana mutant line that carries a mutation in the sterol desaturase enzyme using the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ yeast mutant . we show here using the same _LOCATION_ yeast strain that the fusion protein produced from of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct is catalytically active . in _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ strain is unable to complete the _LOCATION_ biosynthesis and accumulates episterol whereas the _LOCATION_ biosynthetic pathway is partially restored after transformation of _LOCATION_ with the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion construct . one representative analysis out of three independent experiments is shown . the letters in parentheses refers to . compound not detected . similarly the _LOCATION_ mutant was complemented with the fusion protein produced from the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct since _PROTEIN_ encodes the corresponding plant sterol reductase . in the _LOCATION_ strain _LOCATION_ is completely replaced by _LOCATION_ tetraen ol . the induction of the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ clearly re established the biosynthesis of _LOCATION_ in the mutant yeast demonstrating thus the catalytic activity of the engineered protein . the wild type _PROTEIN_ yeast strain was used to assess the functionality of the _METHOD_ fusion protein encoding a sterol reductase . _LOCATION_ as a diene may be a substrate for the engineered sterol reductase . our results show the reduction of the c double bond of sterols in yeast the accumulation of brassicasterol and campesterol upon _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ verifies _METHOD_ as a functional enzyme . in conclusion the _PROTEIN_ of the fusion constructs in yeast and the detection of the expected sterol profiles confirmed that all three fusion enzymes were catalytically active . having demonstrated that the three _METHOD_ fusion enzymes were active in yeast we transformed the _PROTEIN_ and dim arabidopsis mutant lines with the corresponding fusion enzymes . the _PROTEIN_ and mutants bear point mutations in the encoded enzymes _PROTEIN_ and is a t dna insertion mutant . the mutation leads to the accumulation of sterols particularly sitosterol and to a lack of brassinosteroids as a consequence of a depletion in pathway end products campesterol and sitosterol . for this reason the plants display a clear phenotype characterized by short height short internodes increased number of inflorescences dark green round leaves and a slow growth rate compared to the wild type . the dim mutant plants similarly to the show a dwarf phenotype due to the deficiency in brassinosteroids this being caused by a block in the sterol reductase activity . compared to the wild type the dim plants show a reduced level of campesterol and sitosterol associated to an increase of methylene cholesterol and isofucosterol their respective metabolic precursors and substrates of _PROTEIN_ . normally plants only accumulate isofucosterol during early embryogenesis and in flower buds . similarly to the the dim seedlings have also short hypocotyls petioles and roots . leaves of dim are round curly and dark green in color . in adult flowering plants dim shows extremely short inflorescences with small flowers and severely reduced fertility . in contrast the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants show a morphological phenotype closely similar to the wild type . these plants are impaired in the sterol desaturation step and therefore accumulate sterols . since _PROTEIN_ is a weak allele homozygote _PROTEIN_ plants are able to synthesize about of the pathway end products sterols without compromising brassinosteroid biosynthesis . gc fid _METHOD_ of steryl acetates are shown . mutant _METHOD_ partially complemented mutant _METHOD_ fully complemented mutant . dim mutant dim/dim _METHOD_ partially complemented mutant dim/dim _METHOD_ fully complemented mutant . _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ partially complemented mutant _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fully complemented mutant . sterol peaks identified by their retention time and confirmed by gc _METHOD_ _METHOD_ are cholesterol cholesterol cholesterol campesterol campesterol campesterol stigmasterol sitosterol sitosterol sitosterol isofucosterol sitosterol methylene cholesterol stigmasterol avenasterol . full complementation of dim and _PROTEIN_ results in the accumulation of sitosterol instead of sitosterol isofucosterol and sitosterol respectively . the relevant peaks in each complementation are labelled in bold in the relevant panels . the values refer to the partially and fully complemented plants compared to the not complemented . the numbers in parentheses refers to and . tr trace amount compound not detected . accurate sterol nomenclature can be found at iupac http //www.iupac.org . c terminal _METHOD_ fused constructs of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ coding sequences were stably transformed into the corresponding dim and _PROTEIN_ mutants . primary transformants selected for their resistance to kanamycin were selfed to generate then generations . the success of the transformation and the efficiency of the generated constructs were revealed by lines that were fully complemented based on the morphology of individuals as shown for dwarf and on sterol profiles for all three complemented dim and _PROTEIN_ lines . in the case of and dim mutants _METHOD_ and dim _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic lines fall clearly into two categories according to their semi dwarf phenotype indicating partial complementation or to their wild type phenotype indicating full complementation when compared to the parental lines . dim and _PROTEIN_ . dim and _PROTEIN_ partial complemented . dim and _PROTEIN_ complemented . wild type . the integrity of the three _METHOD_ fusion proteins in the transgenic plants was assessed by immunoblot analysis using an antibody directed towards the _METHOD_ protein . this showed the accumulation of products with the expected molecular size for the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusions . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was not detected nor was a degradation product . probably the abundance of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein was below the detection limit of the antibody . the sterol profile established by gc fid and confirmed by gc _METHOD_ for several individual plants from the and generations demonstrated the correct in planta enzyme activity for all fusion proteins indeed partial or full reversion of the sterol composition to wild type was detected in all cases . in addition the level of morphogenetic complementation and metabolic complementation were completely coincident . the _PROTEIN_ that both partial and fully complemented plants were observed for each mutant line shows that the _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ fusion proteins has been performed in the correct mutant backgrounds . the partial restoration of sitosterol biosynthesis observed in _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein is in good agreement with the results reported by husselstein et al . who found the _PROTEIN_ plants showing a sitosterol recovery of about when compared to wild type after transformation with a _PROTEIN_ construct . in conclusion the observations of fully or partially complemented plants shows that all three c terminal _METHOD_ fused enzymes are catalytically active in planta . the full complementation result in a sterol profile and content closely identical to that of the wild type . the enzymes investigated in this work were chosen due to their implication in the _PROTEIN_ steps of sitosterol biosynthesis . sterol metabolism and transport _METHOD_ have been investigated and documented in animals and to some extent in fungi with respect to cellular transport . in plants still little is known about the regulation of sterol biosynthesis and transports . moreover a detailed subcellular localization analysis of the _PROTEIN_ sterol biosynthetic enzymes is lacking . in order to establish the localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ an in silico investigation was performed on their peptide sequences followed by extensive experimental investigations using confocal microscopy . the in silico analysis made with the predotar software based on the presence of signal peptides at n termini of the protein sequences predicted to be localized to the _LOCATION_ with a probability of . in contrast _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were predicted to be non _LOCATION_ proteins with a probability of and respectively . these results are in agreement with the predictions obtained with signal p a protein sequence evaluation software which found a significant probability of the presence of a signal peptide only in . to experimentally assess whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were localized to the _LOCATION_ or to other compartments we used confocal microscopy to analyse cells from the lower epidermal layer of leaves detached from functionally complemented _METHOD_ dim _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants . in accordance with the in silico prediction the _METHOD_ fusion protein showed a clear reticulate structure in confocal observation corresponding to a typical _LOCATION_ localization . this _LOCATION_ localization is consistent with observations reported in the case of the orthologous enzyme dehydrocholesterol reductase in mammalian cells . moreover we observed a clear signal at the periphery of the epidermal cell . an _LOCATION_ like pattern was seen for the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein which also showed a clear signal in the peripheral area . in both cases the peripheral signal suggests that these proteins are synthesized in the endomembrane system for delivery to the pm . confocal images of leaves showing protein distribution in the _LOCATION_ and to the periphery of the cell . chlorophyll _METHOD_ . in red is shown the chlorophyll _METHOD_ combined with the _METHOD_ localized to the pm . the overlay images show the complete separation of red and yellow signal and the co localization of _METHOD_ and indicating the pm association of . scale bars . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal is localized to structures surrounding the _LOCATION_ resembling _LOCATION_ and to the cell periphery . in red is shown the chlorophyll _METHOD_ combined with the _METHOD_ localized to the pm . the overlay image shows the co localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and suggesting the pm association of _PROTEIN_ . scale bars . to further investigate the association of these two proteins to the pm we stained the leaves of transgenic and dim plants _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ respectively with the _LOCATION_ dye . interestingly the human dhcr _PROTEIN_ as well as the yeast _LOCATION_ two orthologs of the plant _PROTEIN_ have been both localized _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ but also to a lesser extent to _LOCATION_ complexes indicating possible dual localizations for enzymes of this type . previously klahre et al . found a n terminal _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein localized in speckled structures in the cytoplasm of pollen tubes this was interpreted as _LOCATION_ . localization to the _LOCATION_ may indicate a possible translocation of this protein to the pm in secretory vesicles . this vesicular transport is known and has been well described in the case of yeast . moreover the _PROTEIN_ localization in the pm can be interpreted as necessary for the fine tuning of the _LOCATION_ properties by regulating the content of sitosterol and campesterol and consequently the response to environmental changes . in addition _PROTEIN_ was already identified as a component of detergent resistant _LOCATION_ or so called lipid rafts isolated from tobacco pm . in addition to _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in transformed _PROTEIN_ mutant plants also displayed an _LOCATION_ like pattern . surprisingly for the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion we further observed an unexpected localization in small and round structures moving across the cytoplasm . as the observed structures resembled lps the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion localization was further investigated by incubating leaves from _PROTEIN_ mutant plants with nile red a lipid specific dye staining cellular lps . results from nile red staining showed a pattern characterized by clear signals deriving from round bodies dispersed into the cytoplasm . the localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was observed to overlap with nile red signals indicating that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is localized to lps as well as to _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization to structures resembling _LOCATION_ and lps . and chlorophyll _METHOD_ . and lps stained with nile red . overlay image of and showing the overlap of the nile red and _METHOD_ signal and the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ signal absent in _PROTEIN_ mutant . overlay image of and showing the distribution of lps in cell of _PROTEIN_ plant . scale bars . lps consist of a phospholipid monolayer which sequesters the hydrophobic core of lps from the _LOCATION_ . this has been well described in yeast . the core of the particles consists of triacylglycerols surrounded by several layers of _PROTEIN_ . the lps represent a storage compartment for fatty acids and sterols in the form of conjugates and appear to be involved in their translocation from _LOCATION_ to all _LOCATION_ of the cells . the mechanism of sterol translocation between _LOCATION_ and lps is not completely clear although it has been recently demonstrated that the lipid droplets could originate from the _LOCATION_ and are probably involved into a non vesicular sterol transport to the pm . studies performed on a tobacco mutant overproducing sterols showed that the excess of sterols was converted into steryl esters which were accumulated into lps . the storage and translocation mechanism would then be impossible without enzymes that mobilize these conjugates . in yeast although the sterol synthesizing enzymes are _PROTEIN_ localized in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ enzymes show a dual localization on _LOCATION_ and lps while _LOCATION_ has been localized only on lps . in addition four of the seven acyltransferases one of the three lipases and two of the three _PROTEIN_ hydrolases identified until now have been localized to lps in yeast . recently a phospholipid sterol acyltransferase _PROTEIN_ and a sterol o acyltransferase _PROTEIN_ have been identified in arabidopsis where the enzyme activities were associated with microsomal _LOCATION_ . the esterification reaction and the major enzyme responsible for this process namely the _PROTEIN_ was described but so far plant _PROTEIN_ hydrolases have not been identified . the sterol desaturase _PROTEIN_ displays a dual localization in the _LOCATION_ and the lps in arabidopsis revealing an unexpected subcellular localization for this enzyme and a possible yet unknown role of the lps in in sterol biosynthesis . interestingly the link between sterol esterification and the activity of the sterol desaturase has been shown in yeast where the disruption of the sterol acyltransferase genes and were followed by a _PROTEIN_ of _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . this indicates that the absence of sterol esterification leads to a _PROTEIN_ in total intracellular sterols . it could assign a role for _LOCATION_ in the storage process of sterol esters . moreover the examination of microarray data related to the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in wild type arabidopsis revealed a high level of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in seeds . this indication also could be viewed as part of the lipid accumulation process in seeds . we further analyzed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants by confocal microscopy and were able to detect strong signals along the vascular tissues from giant compartments which were then identified as lps . interestingly it has been reported that the silencing of the major seed oleosin gene of arabidopsis resulted in an aberrant phenotype of embryo cells that contain larger oil bodies than those found in the wild type . changes in the size of oil bodies caused disruption of storage organelles altering accumulation of lipids and proteins and causing delay in germination . the vascular localization could suggest a systemic lipid transport in plant probably associated with lipoproteins as for instance oleosins and steroleosin _PROTEIN_ . a mechanism of that type is well known in the case of mammalian cholesterol homeostasis implicating in particular an _LOCATION_ transport of cholesterol through the _PROTEIN_ receptor machinery . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signal in leaf vascular tissue . chlorophyll _METHOD_ . overlay image of and . scale bars . in conclusion we have shown that c terminal _METHOD_ fusion proteins of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were found to localize to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . surprisingly sterol reductase _PROTEIN_ was further localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ whereas sterol desaturase _PROTEIN_ was also clearly detected in lipid particles . we suggest that the partial and/or full complementation of all three biochemical mutants that is a partial and/or full restoration of a wild type sterol profile and morphology upon _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ fusions indicate a relevant subcellular localization of the engineered enzymes . in _PROTEIN_ the identical confocal images observed whether the complementation was partial or full rule out a hypothetical mislocalization of the accumulated _METHOD_ fusions . therefore the different localization patterns observed for the three different enzymes support their correct subcellular localization . together these findings raise new _PROTEIN_ questions about the spatial organization of sterol biosynthesis in plants and the implication of this localization in cellular lipid homeostasis .
