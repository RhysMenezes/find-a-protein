as a starting point we measured the transcript levels of several endogenous tgs markers that are known to be reactivated by high temperatures and compared wt _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ seedlings . the markers included the centromeric repeat the pericentromeric _PROTEIN_ repeat the multicopy onsen retrotransposon and the single copy locus . the reactivation of these tgs loci was found previously to be attenuated in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . with the exception of onsen these markers are transcriptionally activated in the _PROTEIN_ background under growth conditions . in the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants the normally silent repeat _PROTEIN_ and were activated either before or after prolonged exposure to for h to extents that were similar to those observed in _PROTEIN_ . by contrast although transcription of onsen was activated in _PROTEIN_ after heat treatment the amount of transcript was considerably less than that observed in the wt and _PROTEIN_ and identical to that detected in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . these results demonstrated that there are two distinguishable control _METHOD_ for tgs that involve either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ respectively . these results imply also that whereas some tgs loci are regulated by both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ some are controlled specifically by _PROTEIN_ . in addition to the constraint of release of tgs mutation of _PROTEIN_ also results in restriction of the decondensation of chromocenters . given that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are involved in distinct regulatory pathways for tgs as indicated above it was considered likely that the phenomenon of _PROTEIN_ compact chromocenters under heat stress would with _PROTEIN_ and appear in _PROTEIN_ double mutant plants . to verify this roots of seedlings were stained with the _METHOD_ dye dapi and the _LOCATION_ of cells in the zones of elongation and maturation were monitored for changes in chromocenter morphology . before exposure to heat stress compact chromocenters were clearly visible in most _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ which was similar to the levels observed in the wt _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . after exposure to heat for h at or heat shock for min at dispersion of chromocenters was obvious in the wt and _PROTEIN_ as judged by diffuse nucleoplasmic labeling with dapi . however most _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ discernible dapi _METHOD_ in a subnuclear domain as observed for _PROTEIN_ . these results indicated that _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ is associated with decompaction of the chromocenters . given that decondensation of chromocenters is restricted in _PROTEIN_ but not in _PROTEIN_ and previous transient _PROTEIN_ analysis using green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein in arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts revealed that _PROTEIN_ is localized to chromocenters at it was reasonable to assume that tracking the localization of _PROTEIN_ in situ under high temperature might help elucidate the role of _PROTEIN_ in chromocenter organization and tgs regulation . in this _PROTEIN_ we generated a stable line of transgenic arabidopsis by transforming the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion construct into the _PROTEIN_ background . the transgenic plants were first tested for their ability to complement the phenotype of _PROTEIN_ . as shown in fig . the transgenic _PROTEIN_ plants that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tolerated both sustained high temperature and sudden treatments in a similar manner to wt seedlings which indicated that the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was molecularly functional . transgenic seedlings were subjected to heat treatment at and for various durations and the _METHOD_ signals in root cell _LOCATION_ were observed under a _METHOD_ microscope . initially _METHOD_ signals that were localized at chromocenters disappeared and aggregated into a single subnuclear domain in each _LOCATION_ within h at or min at . by contrast chromocenters _METHOD_ remained conspicuous without noticeable morphological change at these time points and clear decompaction of chromocenters was seen only after the seedlings had been heat stressed for h at or for min at . on the basis of its number and morphology the subnuclear compartment to which _METHOD_ was localized upon heat treatment corresponded most probably to the nucleolus . this hypothesis was tested by examining arabidopsis protoplasts that _METHOD_ and a nucleolar marker protein _PROTEIN_ tagged with mcherry . the _METHOD_ signal with mcherry after the protoplasts had been incubated for h at which indicated that _PROTEIN_ indeed relocated to the nucleolus in response to heat treatment . to investigate the nature of the relocation of _PROTEIN_ further _METHOD_ transgenic seedlings that had been subjected to heat stress at for h or for min were transferred to and their _METHOD_ signals were monitored continuously . the _METHOD_ signals were observed to return to chromocenters after recovery for d at . collectively these results suggested that the _PROTEIN_ decondensation of chromocenters involves both temporal and spatial _PROTEIN_ and demonstrated that relocation of _PROTEIN_ in response to high temperature is a reversible process . given that _PROTEIN_ is a missense mutation in which the codon for ser is changed to tyr it was envisaged that the _PROTEIN_ phenotypes result from the altered function of the _PROTEIN_ protein . the relocation of _PROTEIN_ from chromocenters to the nucleolus in response to heat stress and the observation that the relocation occurred before decompaction of chromocenters prompted us to speculate that the function of _PROTEIN_ is to _PROTEIN_ the condensed structure of chromocenters and that the _PROTEIN_ mutant protein had an impaired ability to leave chromocenters under high temperature which thus restricted decondensation of chromocenters . to examine this hypothesis we generated a stable line of transgenic arabidopsis by transforming the _METHOD_ fusion construct driven by the _PROTEIN_ promoter into _PROTEIN_ plants . the resultant transgenic plants were tested first for their heat sensitivity . the plants were intolerant to both sustained heat stress at for d and sudden heat shock at for min as is the case for _PROTEIN_ plants as expected . green _METHOD_ in root cell _LOCATION_ of _METHOD_ transgenic _PROTEIN_ plants was monitored under a _METHOD_ microscope . initially green _METHOD_ was observed in the chromocenters . after heat stress for h at or min at the green _METHOD_ was replaced by green _METHOD_ . these changes in the localization of the _METHOD_ signals persisted after the seedlings were heat stressed for h at or for min at . at these time points the chromocenters in the transgenic plants remained condensed and were discernible as spots whereas those in the wt were dispersed . therefore the missense _PROTEIN_ mutation did not affect the ability of its protein product to relocate in response to heat stress and correct relocalization of _PROTEIN_ alone was insufficient to promote decondensation of chromocenters . the _PROTEIN_ protein contains _LOCATION_ localization signal sequences . immunodetection of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transiently in tobacco cells demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ is localized to the _LOCATION_ . however in contrast to arabidopsis which has a small genome n. tabacum is an amphiploid species with a very large genome . consequently the majority of the tobacco _LOCATION_ consists of heterochromatin which does not display chromocenters . to investigate the subnuclear localization of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis in detail and to clarify the relationship between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the control of tgs and reorganization of chromocenters we stably introduced a _METHOD_ fusion construct driven by the promoter into arabidopsis plants . these transgenic plants showed _METHOD_ foci in their _LOCATION_ which were identified easily by the observation of root cells under a _METHOD_ microscope . when counterstained with dapi clear colocalization of _PROTEIN_ foci with chromocenters was indicated by the perfect overlay of the _METHOD_ and dapi _METHOD_ signals . continuous monitoring revealed that _PROTEIN_ remained localized at chromocenters after the transgenic seedlings had been heat stressed for h at or min at under which conditions _PROTEIN_ had relocated to the nucleolus . after heat stress for h at or for min at during which decondensation of chromocenters occurred the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ foci dispersed in a pattern identical to that of the foci . to corroborate further that the subnuclear localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in response to high temperature differed protoplasts derived from arabidopsis cell suspensions were transformed for transient of with _METHOD_ . before heat treatment _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were colocalized to chromocenters . after heat stress for h at or min at mcherry _METHOD_ dissipated from chromocenters and appeared in the nucleolus whereas _METHOD_ _METHOD_ remained at the chromocenters . thus _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ indeed become separated spatially under heat stress . we then compared the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutants and _PROTEIN_ double mutant at the physiological level by testing their survivability after heat stress treatment . to induce prolonged high temperature stress seedlings grown in medium were transferred to an incubator at . after treatment for d _PROTEIN_ seedlings remained green in color similar to wt seedlings whereas _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings were totally bleached . for sudden treatment seedlings grown in medium were exposed to for min and then returned to for further observation . after recovery for d at the and _PROTEIN_ seedlings remained alive and exhibited noticeable growth as judged by the emergence and expansion of true leaves whereas the leaves of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings were bleached completely and no signs of growth were observed . these results demonstrated that the mutant of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ showed differential capabilities for thermotolerance and implied that the physiological effects that resulted from restriction of the reactivation of tgs in _PROTEIN_ are not compensated by _PROTEIN_ release from tgs .
