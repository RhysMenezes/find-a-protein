double b box belongs to the zinc finger family proteins in arabidopsis thaliana . transcriptional analysis uncovered that the gene _PROTEIN_ was blue light dependently regulated and the transcript level of in _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ but not in _PROTEIN_ compared to wild type under blue light conditions . transgenic plants containing gus _PROTEIN_ displayed gus activity in the vascular system of leaves and petioles . green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fused _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein was found in the _LOCATION_ in transient transformation assays with onion epidermal cells as well as in stable transgenic arabidopsis plants . to investigate the function of we generated over _PROTEIN_ and under _PROTEIN_ transgenic arabidopsis plants . analysis of hypocotyl growth of these lines indicated that promoted hypocotyl elongation under blue light condition . the phenotype of transgenic plants with over _PROTEIN_ could be impaired by a gibberellin biosynthesis inhibitor . moreover the _PROTEIN_ analysis of ga metabolic and catabolic genes in transgenic lines indicated that the suppressed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but induced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under blue light . taken together we concluded that promotes hypocotyl elongation under blue light condition through an increase in bioactive ga levels in arabidopsis .
the _PROTEIN_ of in col seedlings with blue light treatments was determined . the result showed that transcript level of was increasingly up regulated by higher fluence rates of blue light . furthermore we found that the transcript abundance of was more induced by prolonged blue light treatment . we also measured transcript abundance of a well characterized marker gene for blue light induction _PROTEIN_ which served as a positive control . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are the major photoreceptors involved in the hypocotyl growth . compared to the wild type the _PROTEIN_ mutant hypocotyls were longer both under red light and blue light while _PROTEIN_ mutant hypocotyls were only longer under blue light _PROTEIN_ . we used q pcr to measure the transcript abundance of in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . our results showed that the transcript level of in _PROTEIN_ mutant was _PROTEIN_ compared to wild type but no obvious difference was observed between wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant . several independent primary transformants were identified due to basta resistance . transgenic plants were subsequently regenerated and used for phenotype analyses . the _PROTEIN_ levels of transgenes were elucidated by q pcr . the results showed that the transcript level of in two independent over _PROTEIN_ lines and was significantly higher than that of wild type whereas it was distinctly lower in independent and transgenic lines . as had high homology to several other members of the dbb subfamily we checked the _PROTEIN_ of those dbb subfamily genes in rnai lines and the result indicated that those genes did not substantially alter their _PROTEIN_ compared with wild type . the bp region upstream of the translational start codon _PROTEIN_ of was fused to the gus gene and the resulting construct was transformed into wild type arabidopsis plants to produce a set of independent gus lines . gus activities of five gus independent transgenic lines were detected in the vascular system of young leaves and petioles of day old transgenic seedlings and all showed the same phenotype . in week old transgenic plants gus activity was also observed in the vascular system of the rosette leaves and petioles . these data show a distinct _PROTEIN_ pattern of in specific tissues of the plant . to investigate the subcellular localization of protein we fused the coding region of to n terminus of _METHOD_ under the control of cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . this _METHOD_ fusion was both tested by transformation assay in onion epidermal cells and by introduction into arabidopsis plants . the results showed that was localized to the _LOCATION_ in onion epidermal cells as well as in transgenic arabidopsis plants . the image of _METHOD_ transgenic seedlings was used as a control . to investigate the function of in light mediated early plant development the over _PROTEIN_ and under _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines were germinated at different fluence rates of monochromatic blue red and far red light . the result showed that those seedlings had the same hypocotyl length with wild type in the dark condition . however compared with wild type and sgs the over _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines had longer hypocotyls and the under _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines had shorter hypocotyls under blue light . differences in hypocotyl length were obvious under blue light fluence rates of however no significant differences in hypocotyl length were observed among the above strains under red or far red light . besides no cotyledon or root phenotypes were observed in over _PROTEIN_ or under _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines . these results lead us to conclude that acts as a negative regulator of blue light mediated hypocotyl elongation . gas exert an opposite effect to light on photomorphogenesis . besides when ga synthesis was inhibited the _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings grown in blue light with relatively higher fluence rates exhibited greater hypocotyl elongation in response to _PROTEIN_ than the wild type seedlings . to check whether ga was involved in the development of mediated hypocotyl elongation under blue light we examined the effects of exogenous _PROTEIN_ and the gas biosynthesis inhibitor paclobutrazol on hypocotyl elongation in over _PROTEIN_ under _PROTEIN_ and col seedlings under blue light . the result showed that the over _PROTEIN_ line only responded weakly to bioactive _PROTEIN_ however ga biosynthesis inhibitor paclobutrazol could impair the phenotype of over _PROTEIN_ and under _PROTEIN_ lines under blue light . those results indicated that ga was required for mediated hypocotyl elongation . to investigate the role of in the regulation of some ga metabolic and catabolic genes _PROTEIN_ under blue light we performed q pcr analyses to measure the _PROTEIN_ of ga metabolic genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and ga biosynthesis genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in day old over _PROTEIN_ under _PROTEIN_ and col seedlings in transient induction under blue light condition . as shown in fig . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were lower in the transgenic plants and higher in transgenic plants however the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were lower in and higher in . taken together these results suggest that can increase bioactive ga levels under blue light growth conditions .
arabidopsis thaliana l. ecotype columbia mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were obtained from chentao lin laboratory . col was used for the background in this study . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ had been described previously . to avoid co suppression the over _PROTEIN_ plasmid was also transformed to sgs mutant . the surface sterilized seeds were sown on murashige and skoog medium containing sucrose and were cold treated at for days . after exposure to white light for h to stimulate germination seeds were transferred to appropriate light conditions under long day conditions _PROTEIN_ at . to investigate the response of blue light mediated inhibition of hypocotyl elongation to exogenous _PROTEIN_ and the ga biosynthesis inhibitor paclobutrazol seeds were surface sterilized in ethanol for s in for min and rinsed five times with sterile distilled water . all hormone and inhibitor stocks were dissolved in ethanol as a concentrate . the final concentrations of _PROTEIN_ and the paclobutrazol in the murashige and skoog medium were indicated in respective figures . seeds were placed in the dark at for days exposed to white light for h to enhance germination then transferred to temperature controlled growth chambers and grown under continuous blue light or in the dark at . in addition to light sources reported previously _PROTEIN_ b _PROTEIN_ r and _PROTEIN_ fr were also used . fluence rates of white red and blue light were measured using an li quantum photometer _PROTEIN_ . the approximate fluence rates of fr light were estimated by plotting the relative fluence rate measured with an li quantum photometer to a near linear standard curve of fluence rates measured with a spectroradiometer as described previously . total rna was extracted using puprep rnaeasy mini kit . dna free rna was obtained by dnase treatment according to the manufacturer s instructions . each cdna sample was diluted in sterile and of diluted cdna was used in a pcr reaction . the q pcr analyses were performed using sybr green pcr master mix _METHOD_ using an real time pcr system and data were analyzed with mxpro software . the cycling parameters were for min followed by cycles of for s for s and for s. each gene was assayed in three biological replicates and normalized using . the primers used for real time pcr were listed in table . using genomic sequences from the database the full length _PROTEIN_ open reading frame was amplified from cdna by pcr with primers _PROTEIN_ and cloned into pensg _METHOD_ gw vector using gateway to obtain the binary vector _METHOD_ as described and the binary vector of _METHOD_ was used as a control . the special fragment sequences of were pcr amplified with primer pairs and respectively and cloned into to obtain the rnai constructs . the binary vectors were sequenced to verify in frame fusion of pcr fragments to the _METHOD_ gene . all constructs were transformed into agrobacterium tumefaciens strain using the freeze thaw method and into col strains using the floral dipping method respectively . those three kinds of rnai constructs were transformed into independently but were transformed into arabidopsis with a mixture . as the gene was co suppressed in col background over _PROTEIN_ construct was also transformed to sgs mutant . transformed plants were selected by spraying with _PROTEIN_ herbicide and several individual lines with a single t dna locus as determined by the segregation of basta resistant versus sensitive ratios were selected . homozygous transgenic plants were used for further studies as described previously . the bp region upstream of the translational start _PROTEIN_ of was cloned from the genomic dna of the columbia ecotype and fused to the gus report gene to form a binary vector using the _PROTEIN_ cloning system . the sequences of all primers are given in table . the gus fusion gene was introduced into columbia and lines were used for analysis . gus staining was performed for h at using x _PROTEIN_ as described previously . the material was washed repeatedly in ethanol until the tissue was bleached . the stained tissue was then observed and photographed using an olympus microscope as described previously . each plate was shot twice . each shot contains gold particles and particles were coated with of _METHOD_ recombinant plasmid at . the gold coated dna particles were delivered into onion epidermal cells using the _PROTEIN_ biolistic particle delivery system and the bombarded onion epidermal peels were _PROTEIN_ at for at least h until they were examined by _METHOD_ microscopy according to lee et al . . to visualize the _METHOD_ fusion protein transgenic seedlings _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were mounted onto slides and examined under a laser confocal _METHOD_ microscopy . _METHOD_ fluorescense was induced by exposure to blue light .
