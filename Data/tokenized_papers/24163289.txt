the arabidopsis stomatal complex is composed of a pair of guard cells and surrounding anisocytic subsidiary cells . subsidiary cells are thought to function as a supplier and receiver of bulk water and ions and to assist turgor driven stomatal movement but the molecular _METHOD_ are largely unknown . in this work we studied the dynamic behavior and environmental responses of _PROTEIN_ which has been identified as a translocation _PROTEIN_ of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proton pump _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in guard cells and subsidiary cells in arabidopsis thaliana . variable angle _METHOD_ microscopic observation revealed that green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localized on dot like compartments that resided on _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ for several seconds . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labeled dots were sensitive to phosphatidylinositol kinase inhibitors but not to a phosphatidylinositol kinase inhibitor . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ co localized in hyperosmotic conditions and a mutation of _PROTEIN_ resulted in an increase in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ internalization suggesting a role in the translocation of pm h _PROTEIN_ in subsidiary cells . interestingly subsidiary cells showed changes in localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in response to environmental stimuli that were opposite to those in guard cells . our observations suggested that _PROTEIN_ may contribute to stomatal movement by translocations of pm h _PROTEIN_ in subsidiary cells .
gene _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ were studied by _PROTEIN_ reporter assay with _PROTEIN_ gus transgenic lines . in the leaf non stomatal epidermal cells there were both gus reporter positive and negative cells . the gus positive cells were observed to be in small subsidiary cells adjacent to the guard cells . measurements of cell area and complexity showed that small and simply shaped epidermal cells tended to show _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . these results indicated that _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in subsidiary cells in a. thaliana . our previous studies suggested that _PROTEIN_ is crucial for the precise localization of the pm h _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to gain more insight into _PROTEIN_ functions on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ surface we observed _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ dynamics using variable angle _METHOD_ microscopy . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ highlighted dots on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in both guard cells and subsidiary cells . interestingly we found that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labeled dots appeared on _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ then disappeared after residing at the same site for several seconds . kymograph analysis showed that their residence times were about s both in guard cells and in subsidiary cells implying that _PROTEIN_ functions in both types of cell . the dynamic behavior of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ dots on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ suggested a relationship between _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ phosphoinositides signaling components of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . therefore we next performed pharmacological experiments on subsidiary cells with inhibitors of phosphoinositide kinase _PROTEIN_ or phosphoinositide kinase _PROTEIN_ which synthesize phosphoinositide phosphate or phosphoinositide phosphate respectively . treatment with wortmannin which inhibits both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ significantly _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labeled dots compared with dimethylsulfoxide _METHOD_ control . a _PROTEIN_ specific inhibitor did not perturb the dynamics of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ dots . on the other hand a _PROTEIN_ specific inhibitor phenylarsine oxide _PROTEIN_ eliminated _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ dots . these results suggested that the formation of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ dots on _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ is required for _PROTEIN_ activity . in guard cells _PROTEIN_ co localized with _PROTEIN_ a pm h _PROTEIN_ . to examine the co localization in subsidiary cells we monitored changes in localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and red _METHOD_ protein tagged _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ after hyperosmotic treatment . just after the hyperosmotic treatment many _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ dots were observed on _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was evenly distributed on _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or rarely labeled dot like organelles and showed little co localization with _PROTEIN_ . thirty minutes after the hyperosmotic treatment several larger _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ dots were observed but then _PROTEIN_ in number . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ aggregated on _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and began to co localize with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ dots suggesting the relationship between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in subsidiary cells as well as in guard cells . we next observed differences in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localization in wild type and mutant background plants . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ predominantly localized on _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and a few organelles in guard cells and subsidiary cells . the mutation induced larger _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labeled organelles and increased their number . these observations indicated that _PROTEIN_ functions in _PROTEIN_ delivery to _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in subsidiary cells . in guard cells _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ dot number increased in response to drought stress and _PROTEIN_ in response to light irradiation as previously reported . surprisingly we found the opposite responses in subsidiary cells . after leaf detachment _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ dot number significantly _PROTEIN_ in subsidiary cells while they increased in guard cells . after h of dark treatment and white light irradiation _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ dots significantly increased in subsidiary cells while they _PROTEIN_ in guard cells . we also checked exogenous aba responses of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in guard cells and subsidiary cells . stomata were pre opened by white light irradiation and floated on buffer with _METHOD_ or aba for min under the white light condition . aba treatment significantly increased _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ dots in guard cells . in contrast in subsidiary cells the exogenous aba treatment significantly _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ dots . these results suggested that there are cell type specific regulation _METHOD_ for pm h _PROTEIN_ translocations .
arabidopsis thaliana ecotype columbia and transgenic lines used were grown on solid half strength murashige and skoog medium for d in growth chambers set at relative humidity and a h light/dark cycle using white lights . cotyledons of to day old plants were used for image acquisition . all _METHOD_ protein tagged markers were _PROTEIN_ under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . cotyledons were covered with a glass slide and observed under a variable angle _METHOD_ microscope equipped with a total internal reflection microscopy unit and an electron multiplying charge coupled device camera head system or with a spinning disk confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with a confocal scanning head and a cooled ccd camera head system . to monitor the dynamics of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ we captured time sequential images using the menu acquire stream acquisition of the metamorph software with frames at _METHOD_ exposure time . to obtain a kymograph image we used the metamorph menu stack kymograph . for dual observation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ by spinning disk confocal laser scanning microscopy _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were excited with a nm laser _PROTEIN_ and a nm laser . _METHOD_ was detected through a nm band pass filter for _METHOD_ and a nm band pass filter for _METHOD_ . for hyperosmotic treatments leaves were incubated in basal buffer with m mannitol for min . for stomatal opening plants were grown in darkness for h and then their leaves were irradiated with white light for min with a cold light illumination system _PROTEIN_ . to prevent drying mm _PROTEIN_ agarose gels with opening buffer were placed onto the leaves . exogenous aba treatment was performed as described by citation with minor modifications . cotyledons were floated on opening buffer and incubated under light conditions for min to open the stomata . subsequently the cotyledons with pre opened stomata were transferred to the same buffer supplemented with _METHOD_ or aba for min and then observed . seedlings were immersed in basal buffer supplemented with wortmannin or _PROTEIN_ for h .
