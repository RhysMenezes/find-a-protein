plant hormone abscisic acid plays a crucial role in modulating plant responses to environmental stresses . basic helix loop helix transcription _PROTEIN_ are one of the largest transcription _PROTEIN_ families that regulate multiple aspects of plant growth and development as well as of plant metabolism in arabidopsis . several bhlh transcription _PROTEIN_ have been shown to be involved in the regulation of aba signaling . we report here the characterization of a bhlh transcription _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . we found that the _PROTEIN_ level of was reduced in response to exogenously applied aba and elevated in the aba biosynthesis mutant _PROTEIN_ . florescence observation of transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed that was localized in the _LOCATION_ and transient _PROTEIN_ of in protoplasts inhibited reporter gene _PROTEIN_ . when _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis under the control of the promoter promoted root elongation and the transgenic plants were less sensitivity to aba in root elongation assays . quantitative rt pcr results showed that aba response of several genes involved in aba signaling including _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were altered in the transgenic plants overexpressing . taken together our study suggests that is a transcription repressor that negatively regulates aba response in arabidopsis .
arabidopsis bhlh transcription _PROTEIN_ have been shown to regulate plant metabolism as well as multiple aspects of plant growth and development . several bhlh transcription _PROTEIN_ are reported to regulate aba response . our previously microarray data showed that _PROTEIN_ of is regulated by aba suggesting that may involve in the regulation of aba response . to investigate the possible roles of in aba response in arabidopsis we examined if the _PROTEIN_ of is regulated by aba . we first examined if aba treatment will affect the _PROTEIN_ of . arabidopsis seedlings were treated with aba for h rna was isolated and rt pcr or quantitative rt pcr was used to examine the _PROTEIN_ of . as shown in _PROTEIN_ level of in arabidopsis seedlings was dramatically reduced in response to exogenously applied aba . quantitative rt pcr results showed that transcript levels of were _PROTEIN_ about fold and fold respectively after aba and epibrassinolide treatments but remained largely unchanged after methyl jasmonate treatment . we then examined if _PROTEIN_ of is altered in _PROTEIN_ an aba biosynthesis mutant . we found that the transcript levels of increased fold in the _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings . these results suggest that is an aba response gene and its _PROTEIN_ is down regulated by aba . to examine the _PROTEIN_ patterns of different tissues and organs were collected from arabidopsis seedlings and mature plants and rt pcr was used to examine the _PROTEIN_ of in the samples collected . we found that transcripts of were detectable in all tissues and organs examined but _METHOD_ with relative higher _PROTEIN_ levels detected in roots and cotyledons . to examine the _PROTEIN_ patterns of in more details we generated reporter transgenic plants by transforming wild type plants with gus construct and examined gus _PROTEIN_ in the transgenic plants . we found that consistent with the rt pcr results gus was highly _PROTEIN_ in the roots and cotyledons but not _METHOD_ . higher _PROTEIN_ level of gus was also observed in hypocotyls and some flower organs . we also found that gus was _PROTEIN_ in young rosette leaves and the lower part of young siliques but not mature rosette leaves and old siliques suggesting that _PROTEIN_ of gus appears to be developmentally regulated . some bhlh transcription _PROTEIN_ such as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have been shown to be transcription activators whereas some others such as jasmonate associated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are repressors . to explore s functions in arabidopsis we decided to examine if functions as transcription activator or repressor . we first examined s subcellular localization by generating _METHOD_ transgenic plants and examining _METHOD_ florescence in the transgenic plants . the _METHOD_ transgenic plant seedlings have longer primary root when compared with that in col wild type seedlings a phenotype similar to that of the transgenic plants suggesting that the _METHOD_ was functional . by examining _METHOD_ florescence in the root of the _METHOD_ transgenic plant seedlings obtained we found that is predominantly localized in the _LOCATION_ . we then examined transcriptional activities of using protoplast transient transfection assays . plasmids of activator gene _PROTEIN_ vp effector gene gd or control gene gd and the reporter gene lexa gus were co transfected into protoplasts and gus activities were measured after incubation of the transfected protoplasts overnight at darkness . in this system the _PROTEIN_ vp activator can be recruited to the lexa dna binding site thus activating the reporter gene whereas gd control or gd can be recruited to the dna binding site of the reporter gene . if functions as a transcription repressor co transfection of gd will result in repression of the reporter gene activated by _PROTEIN_ vp . as shown in co transfection of the activator gene _PROTEIN_ vp and the control gene gd activated the reporter gene while co transfection of the effector gene gd resulted in repression of the reporter gene indicating that is a transcription repressor . having shown that _PROTEIN_ of is down regulated by aba and functions as a transcription repressor we further explored the functions of by generating transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ under the control of the promoter isolating knock out mutants and examining phenotypes of the transgenic plants and the mutants obtained . plant overexpressing was obtained by transforming col wild type plants with the construct and knock out mutant was isolated from a salk t dna insertion line obtained from _PROTEIN_ . as shown in transgenic arabidopsis seedlings have increased primary root length when compared with that of the wild type seedlings whereas the primary root length of the mutant seedlings were largely indistinguishable from that of the wild type seedlings . quantitative analysis showed that there was an increase in the primary root length of the transgenic plants . overexpression of in the transgenic plants and knock out of in the mutant were confirmed by rt pcr . transgenic plant seedlings _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tagged _METHOD_ also resulted in increased primary root length indicating that _METHOD_ is functional thus the plants were used to examine subcellular localization of . because is an aba response gene we further examined if is involved in regulating aba response by examining aba responsiveness of the transgenic plants obtained . aba inhibited root elongation was used to analyze aba responsiveness in the transgenic plants . four day old seedlings of wild type and the transgenic plants grown on vertical _METHOD_ plates were transferred to new _METHOD_ plates at the presence and absence of aba and grown vertically for additional days . the primary root length was measured and percentage of root inhibition was calculated . as shown in arabidopsis seedlings over _PROTEIN_ was less sensitive to aba treatments . the root elongation of wild type seedlings was inhibited about by aba whereas that of transgenic plants was only about . root elongation was further inhibited by aba however the transgenic plant seedlings were still less sensitive to aba treatments when compared with that of the wild type seedlings . on the other hand a near wild type response to aba treatments was observed with the mutant seedlings . aba signaling is regulated by several different types of proteins including the central regulators protein phosphatase _PROTEIN_ a group proteins and sucrose nonfermenting related protein kinases . to investigate why the transgenic plants were less sensitive to aba treatment when compared to the col wild type we examined the _PROTEIN_ of some aba signaling regulator genes including _PROTEIN_ genes and genes in the transgenic plants . as shown in the _PROTEIN_ levels of gene _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ gene aba insensitive _PROTEIN_ in the transgenic plant seedlings were largely unaffected . when compared to that in the col wild type plant seedlings however their response to aba was altered in the transgenic plants overexpressing . an folds induction of the above mentioned genes in response to aba was observed in the col wild type seedlings . in the transgenic seedlings the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was no longer induced by aba treatment . on the other hand _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ in response to aba in the transgenic plant seedlings was reduced to about two third of that in the wild type seedlings whereas the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ was increased about folds .
