the trans _LOCATION_ network of plant cells sorts and packages _LOCATION_ products into secretory and vesicles . we have analyzed of tgn cisternae in arabidopsis root meristem cells by cell fractionation and electron microscopy/tomography to establish reliable criteria for identifying tgn cisternae in plant cells and to define their functional attributes . transformation of a trans _LOCATION_ cisterna into a _LOCATION_ tgn cisterna begins with cisternal peeling the formation of sv buds outside the plane of the cisterna and a reduction in cisternal _LOCATION_ area . free tgn compartments are defined as cisternae that have detached from the _LOCATION_ to become independent organelles . _LOCATION_ and free tgn compartments but not trans _LOCATION_ cisternae bind and kinase _PROTEIN_ antibodies . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ localize to budding svs in the tgn and to svs en route to the cell surface . sv and ccv release occurs simultaneously via cisternal fragmentation which typically yields vesicles and one to four residual cisternal fragments . early endosomal markers _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ colocalized with _PROTEIN_ in tgn cisternae suggesting that the secretory and endocytic pathways converge at the tgn . knockout mutant plants produce svs with highly variable sizes indicating that _PROTEIN_ regulates sv size .
the similarity of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ to rab _PROTEIN_ from yeast and animals which are known to function in sorting and recycling pathways indicated that it too may be involved in _LOCATION_ events at the tgn citation . to characterize the identity of _PROTEIN_ compartments at a higher level of detail than available from light microscopy we examined root tip cells of arabidopsis and arabidopsis stably _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ by . the antibodies specifically labeled tubulovesicular _LOCATION_ compartments on the trans side of _LOCATION_ stacks which were also labeled with antibodies that recognize the complex cell wall polysaccharide xyloglucan . although many of the compartments and vesicles were observed in the vicinity of _LOCATION_ stacks some were located at greater distances and closer to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ occasional vesicles were seen fusing with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . antibodies raised against the lipid kinase _PROTEIN_ an effector of _PROTEIN_ citation are also bound to the same compartments as the and the _PROTEIN_ antibodies . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is another arabidopsis small _PROTEIN_ that has been localized to multivesicular bodies in arabidopsiscitation . in root tip cells mvbs were often juxtaposed with the tgn . in such tgn/mvb complex structures _PROTEIN_ immunogold particles were always associated with mvbs and never with tgn cisternae indicating that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are found in different _LOCATION_ compartments . the immunolabeling experiments confirm that _PROTEIN_ and its effector _PROTEIN_ are biochemical markers of tgn cisternae in arabidopsis and suggest that these proteins could be involved in the assembly of svs . based on the observations that antibodies labeled budding structures on tgn cisternae as well as svs in the process of fusing with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ we hypothesized that this _LOCATION_ compartment was involved in trafficking of secretory cargoes en route to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . if this were the case isolated _PROTEIN_ vesicles should also contain cell wall polysaccharides . several different monoclonal antibodies that recognize diagnostic epitopes on complex _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were used to identify the _LOCATION_ fractions on sucrose density gradients which contained these cell wall polysaccharides . odd numbered fractions were analyzed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and immunoblot analysis to detect the presence of _PROTEIN_ while even numbered fractions were used for the polysaccharide analysis . to identify the polysaccharides in these fractions the _LOCATION_ present in even numbered fractions were reisolated by sedimentation detergent solubilized spotted onto nitrocellulose _LOCATION_ and immunoblotted with monoclonal antibodies and . the fractionation patterns observed depended upon the presence of _LOCATION_ vesicles because if detergent was added prior to sedimentation of _LOCATION_ through the sucrose gradient polysaccharides were only detected in early fractions . also the specificity of the antibodies was confirmed by the detection of polysaccharide epitopes on gum arabic gum tragacanth and purified pectin . the antibodies primarily recognize terminally fucosylated xyloglucan citation which was present at highest concentrations in fractions . this pattern essentially parallels the distribution of _PROTEIN_ in the protein fractions and is consistent with immunogoldlabeling results that localized xyloglucans to trans _LOCATION_ and tgn cisternae and to svs . the antibodies which recognize the chain of citation and the antibodies which recognize a distinct epitope on _PROTEIN_ displayed broader fractionation profiles with significant quantities of binding observed in fractions . the antibody binding which signals the presence of pectins citation was highest in fractions with a second peak in fraction . these results indicate that vesicular structures containing both _PROTEIN_ and xyloglucan represent major fractions of _LOCATION_ containing either of these two components . in addition the observation that _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ most closely matched the sedimentation profiles of _LOCATION_ is consistent with earlier observations that the _PROTEIN_ backbone and terminal fucosylation of this class of polysaccharides occurs in trans _LOCATION_ and tgn cisternae while pectic polysaccharides are generated by enzymes located in _PROTEIN_ and trans _LOCATION_ cisternae citation . using techniques we showed that _PROTEIN_ labels tgn compartments closely associated with _LOCATION_ stacks as well as structurally related compartments at variable distances from _LOCATION_ stacks . in confocal micrographs compartments _METHOD_ labeled with tgn markers have been seen to be paired with _LOCATION_ stacks or spatially separated from any _LOCATION_ stacks citation . to determine the extent to which _LOCATION_ and detached free tgn cisternae/compartments share common structural features we have characterized their architecture by electron tomography analysis of frozen and cells . the resolution of em tomography is nm in the and and nm in the citation . this is a to improvement in resolution compared to regular confocal laser scanning microscopy which has a resolution of nm in the and and nm in the citation . in this study we have exploited the higher resolution of electron tomography to structurally distinguish trans _LOCATION_ cisternae _LOCATION_ tgn cisternae free tgn cisternae and fragmenting free tgn cisternae in the process of releasing their svs and ccvs . in addition due to the quantifiable nature of the digital electron tomography datasets we have been able to follow the changes in _LOCATION_ surface area as the trans _LOCATION_ cisternae are converted first to _LOCATION_ and then to free tgn compartments . finally by combining electron tomography analysis and immunolabeling of serial thin sections we have shown that the transformation of a trans _LOCATION_ cisterna into a tgn cisterna coincides with the binding of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins to subdomains of the tgn cisternae that give rise to svs but not to ccvs . transformation of a _LOCATION_ cisterna into a _PROTEIN_ tgn cisterna is accompanied by three structural changes proliferation of round vesicle buds along the periphery that are not confined to the plane of the original trans _LOCATION_ cisterna a reduction in cisternal _LOCATION_ area and the presence of a flattened _LOCATION_ domain that corresponds to the site of attachment of the tgn cisterna to the _LOCATION_ cisterna . svs ccvs and coat protein ib _PROTEIN_ vesicles were distinguished by the structural criteria detailed by donohoe et al . citation . the formation of budding svs that are not confined to the plane of the _LOCATION_ appears to be tightly correlated with the cisternal peeling process . ccv buds are seen often but not always on _LOCATION_ tgn cisternae . in contrast free tgn cisternae always possess ccvs and typically have more ccvs than do the _LOCATION_ tgn cisternae . free tgn cisternae also have more budding svs than _LOCATION_ tgn cisternae . furthermore as the free tgn cisternae continue to mature and become more grape like in appearance the forming svs become more numerous more clearly defined and more darkly stained . they also become smaller with the budding svs on free tgn cisternae measuring nm in diameter versus nm for the svs on _LOCATION_ tgn cisternae . in contrast we did not detect any differences in diameters of the budding ccvs . _PROTEIN_ vesicles which can be identified based on their size and the dark staining of their contents citation are also seen in close proximity to _LOCATION_ tgn cisternae but not around free tgn cisternae . a functional role of these _PROTEIN_ vesicles in recycling _LOCATION_ from _LOCATION_ tgn to trans _LOCATION_ cisternae is suggested by the finding that the formation of _LOCATION_ tgn cisternae from _LOCATION_ cisternae involves a reduction in surface area . in contrast no consistent reduction in the surface area of the free tgn cisternae was observed . another variable in free tgn architecture relates to the ratio of svs to ccvs . in meristematic root tip cells of arabidopsis the sv to ccv ratio can vary from to even on free tgn compartments within the same cell . free tgn cisternae are seen more frequently than cisternae in arabidopsis root meristem cells . the former resembles tgn cisternae which have been described previously citation whereas the free tgn cisternae resemble structures known as a partially coated _LOCATION_ citation citation . _PROTEIN_ antibodies label both _LOCATION_ and free tgn compartments to similar extents but they do not label trans _LOCATION_ cisternae . to further characterize the tgn structures to which the antibodies bind serial thin sections were analyzed by electron tomography . figure depicts tomographic slice images of three consecutive sections . in these images the tgn _LOCATION_ are clearly resolved and a majority of the immunogold particles are seen close to budding domains that possess an _PROTEIN_ darkly staining coat . this coat resembles the coat of svs described by donohoe et al . citation but the staining pattern differs slightly due to the effects of the presence or absence of osmium tetroxide in the medium and to the variable effects of different embedding media on _LOCATION_ staining . for ultrastructural studies the specimens are typically fixed/stained with osmium tetroxide and embedded in epon resin . for the immunolabeling experiments shown here osmium tetroxide was omitted and lowicryl resin was used citation . to confirm that the _PROTEIN_ molecules are associated with budding svs we have employed a new imod software program called imodcurvature to identify potential tgn _LOCATION_ domains based on their _LOCATION_ curvature . budding svs on tgn cisternae of root apical meristem cells of arabidopsis have diameters ranging from to nm . in the model images of the tgn cisternae shown in figure the _LOCATION_ domains with radii of nm are colored green and of the immunogold particles are seen in close proximity to these green _LOCATION_ domains . three additional tgn cisternae analyzed in the same manner yielded out of immunogold particles adjacent to green _LOCATION_ domains with the remaining particles being associated with tgn _LOCATION_ regions that possessed more variable curvatures . in contrast the central flat _LOCATION_ of early tgn cisternae as well as the _LOCATION_ domains of forming ccvs were rarely labeled . together these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ was preferentially associated with sites on tgn _LOCATION_ and are consistent with the colocalization of _PROTEIN_ with the xyloglucan polysaccharide epitope . based on a number of recent microscopy studies of several types of plant cells the tgn has been postulated to function not only in the secretory pathway but also as an early endosomal compartment citation citation citation citation citation . the demonstration that _PROTEIN_ marks tgn cisternae as well as svs that contain secretory cargo has provided us a means for testing this hypothesis by using double immunogold labeling experiments with the early endosomal marker proteins _METHOD_ citation and _METHOD_ citation . to this end we have probed root meristem cell samples from arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ with an _METHOD_ antibody . _METHOD_ immunogold particles were seen associated with compartments but not with _LOCATION_ cisternae nor mvbs . when double labeled with the antibody the _METHOD_ and the _PROTEIN_ gold particles labeled the same tgn compartments . quantitative analyses of the labeling patterns indicated that of the _METHOD_ detected by _METHOD_ immunolabeling was associated with free tgn cisternae in the vicinity of _LOCATION_ stacks and only with the _LOCATION_ tgn cisternae in the _METHOD_ cell line . such differential labeling was not noticed for _METHOD_ in the _METHOD_ line of root meristem cells . the observation that _PROTEIN_ is selectively recruited to emerging svs on plant tgn compartments suggests an important regulatory role for _PROTEIN_ in the formation and budding of svs . examination of transferred dna inserted mutants of _PROTEIN_ and of several of the most closely related raba _PROTEIN_ did not lead to the identification of plants with obvious developmental defects perhaps because of the extreme size of the raba _PROTEIN_ family in plants which contains members citation citation . however the loss of function of the _PROTEIN_ effector protein _PROTEIN_ and of the highly similar _PROTEIN_ resulted in plants with reduced stature and altered root hair morphology and these changes were associated with defects in tgn compartments citation . to further characterize the nature of these defects we have analyzed frozen cells of the double knockout mutant of arabidopsis by means of em tomography . consistent with our earlier observations citation the tgn cisternae displayed fewer budding profiles but the sv buds that were formed were typically larger and more variable in size . svs had diameters of nm approximately of the vesicles in cell from the mutant had diameters > nm . budding sv profiles that were larger than normal were observed on both _LOCATION_ and on free tgn compartments . in contrast neither the structure nor the average number of ccv buds was affected in mutant plants . to determine if the anatomical defects in the double mutants might be caused by a change in cargo content of the svs we analyzed the composition of the cell wall polysaccharide cargo molecules in the svs using the antibody . in contrast to cells the compartments and vesicles of the mutants were on average not only much larger but also bound more gold particles . furthermore the large svs were still capable of delivering their cell wall cargo molecules to the cell wall as evidenced by the wall labeling with the antibodies . taken together these results indicate that the loss of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ activities results in pronounced changes in early and _PROTEIN_ tgn morphology and in an apparent loss of control over sv size . as mentioned earlier the double mutant plants exhibited both a dwarfed growth phenotype and defects in root hair cell expansion despite the apparent ability of the svs to deliver their polysaccharide cargo molecules to the cell walls . to identify the cellular origins of these deficiencies we examined the anatomy of the root tissues and the ultrastructure of root cells of the mutant plants in greater detail . in roots the cells are organized into regular concentric layers and are rectangularly shaped whereas in the double mutant the tissue arrangement is irregular due to the trapezoidal shape and the variable sizes of the cortical endodermis and columella cells . in addition to the differences in cell expansion we also observed defects in cytokinesis that resulted in the formation of disrupted walls and of cell wall stubs . based on these results we conclude that while transport of cell wall components to forming or expanding cell walls is not completely abolished the loss of the _PROTEIN_ effector protein activity results in defects in the delivery of cell wall molecules to cell plates and cell walls . presumably these defects eventually lead to improper cell division and perturbed cell wall expansion .
