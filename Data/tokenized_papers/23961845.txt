heat shock transcription _PROTEIN_ are involved in multiple aspects of stress response and plant growth . however their role during male gametophyte development is largely unknown although the generative phase is the most sensitive and critical period in the plant life cycle . based on a wide screen of mutant lines we identified the mutation in early male gametophytic gene _GENE_ which has the closest homology to _PROTEIN_ gene the member of a heat shock transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gene family . the mutation causes multiple defects in male gametophyte development in both structure and function . because the mutation disrupts an early acting gene these pollen phenotype abnormalities appear from bicellular pollen stage to pollen maturation . moreover the consequent progamic phase is compromised as well as documented by pollen germination defects and limited transmission via male gametophyte . in addition plants are defective in heat stress _PROTEIN_ response and produce notably higher proportion of aberrant pollen grains . protein is targeted specifically to the nucleolus that together with the increased size of the nucleolus in pollen suggests that it is likely to be involved in ribosomal rna biogenesis or other nucleolar functions .
the gene _GENE_ was selected for a detailed analysis as a candidate of pollen putative transcription _PROTEIN_ . originally it was annotated as a member of the heat shock _PROTEIN_ family . however according to the tair annotation _GENE_ was described to contain only an _PROTEIN_ domain while other databases directly included the gene into the _PROTEIN_ family . therefore it can be considered as a side member of the _PROTEIN_ family of transcription _PROTEIN_ annotated as _PROTEIN_ . the appropriate insertion line harbouring the insertion in the only exon of _GENE_ gene was evaluated for possible phenotype defects caused by the mutation . in order to evaluate the level of mrna knockdown caused by the insertion rna was isolated from four pollen developmental stages _PROTEIN_ of homozygous mutant plants and used for with two sets of primers flanking the insertion site . the transcript was absent in all samples verifying its complete knockdown . the _GENE_ gene was previously selected for its early and significantly _PROTEIN_ according to the microarray data . its _PROTEIN_ profile was verified by of mrna isolated from four pollen developmental stages _PROTEIN_ inflorescence leaf stem and root of plant . the transcript was detected only in the spores and in the inflorescence containing both these stages . promoter activity was further verified in gus transgenic plants . in selected plants the gus signal was restricted only to early pollen stages including unm and bcp . no sporophytic tissues were stained with the sole exception for tapetum in young anthers . all phenotypic defects associated with the mutation were observed only in male gametophyte no other visible abnormalities in female gametophyte or in sporophytic tissues including tapetum were found . the mutant phenotype was first observed in mature pollen of homozygous plants showing up to mgu disruption in _METHOD_ of previously published classification . however such _PROTEIN_ was not found in all homozygous plants instead some homozygotes showed milder phenotype defects indicating lower mutation penetrance and _PROTEIN_ . nevertheless the percentage of mgu disruption from heterozygous plants reached about one half of the level found in homozygotes as expected for a gametophytic mutation . the phenotype with the genotype which was proven also in a larger population of about plants . because was an early _PROTEIN_ gene we included the early developmental stages of immature pollen into our analysis in order to find out at what stage the mgu disruption started . firstly it was necessary to characterize the phenotype of wt developing spores because such overview was not available so far . in this respect the presented survey of the arabidopsis wt pollen appearance during its development represents the first published record of this kind . five healthy and plants grown at two different places under standard conditions were used for the analysis . there was no visible difference between plants cultivated at both places . all samples showed very little phenotype variation in all developmental stages . isolated microspores from both and mutant plants showed a uniform image . in the bcp stage however we distinguished two variants in _LOCATION_ arrangement . both the vn and the generative _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ were in bcp tightly bound near the centre of the grain forming mgu . the remaining portion of pollen grains represented a population with more disperse organization of the two _LOCATION_ . we have measured the distance between vn and _PROTEIN_ as a fold of diameter of _PROTEIN_ . such distribution varied in this population of bcp from to _PROTEIN_ diameters . this type represented bcp in wt while in mutant pollen this percentage raised up to . in the tcp we clearly distinguished even three types of mgu arrangement . firstly it was the common image of closely bound mgu in the centre . such type represented in and in the mutant . secondly the mgu figure was not so tightly bound but rather relaxed representing in wt and in mutant pollen . thirdly the mgu arrangement was even looser with various eccentric or separated _LOCATION_ figures counting for in and as many as in mutant . only this pollen phenotype was considered as strongly mgu disrupted in our analyses . because of the complex phenotypic nature of tcp grains of were observed in total from different plants to avoid accidental fluctuation of the phenotype . finally the _PROTEIN_ stage already described above contained mgu disruption in plants and up to in mutants _PROTEIN_ . considering the cellular structure and _LOCATION_ arrangement in tapetal cells we observed this tissue only in young anthers with unm and bcp . we noticed the developmental difference between the two stages particularly rounded cells and large _LOCATION_ in cells at the unm stage while irregular cells and _LOCATION_ shape in tapetum with the first signs of degeneration at the bcp stage . nevertheless such development was similar both in and anthers with no significant difference in subcellular/nuclear organization in tapetum . because we observed the lower proportion of homozygous plants in the population we performed the segregation analysis of the progeny of heterozygous plants . we found the segregation ratio of which was distorted in comparison to the mendelian ratio . the question remained whether this distortion was caused only by the reduced transmission through the male or whether the transmission through the female was also compromised . therefore we outcrossed heterozygous plants to in both directions and observed the reduced transmission through both the male and the female . observed ratio considering the reduction of male gamete transmission we speculated whether the reduction was based on pollen germination ability and/or on the rate of pollen tube growth . to test this possibility we monitored pollen tube growth in vivo . for that reason pistils of plants were pollinated either by wt pollen from plants or by pollen from plants . after h the pistils were collected and stained for callose . the length of pollen tubes was comparable between wt and mutant in several replicates of each pollination experiment . in both cases we observed that pollen tubes in both samples reached the lowest ovules in the ovary after h of growth . to estimate the in vitro pollen germination efficiency wt and mutant pollen was applied on agarose pads and cultivated for h in the humid chamber . after the cultivation the proportion of germinated pollen was checked by light microscopy . the in vitro germination efficiency of pollen grains differed significantly as it dropped from in wt pollen down to in mutants . to further verify the functional link between the insertion in the _GENE_ gene and the phenotype observed we cloned the whole genomic sequence including the upstream region of bp and into the pkgw vector for the complementation analysis . out of transformants in generation in background we observed the wt phenotype in plants and the mild mutant phenotype in plants indicating the functional rescue of the wt phenotype . only two plants showed even stronger phenotype than the background itself . on the basis of these results we confirmed that the pollen phenotype defects of line result from the mutation of _GENE_ gene . the localization of fusion proteins with _METHOD_ in transiently transformed tobacco leaf epidermis was restricted to the _LOCATION_ with significantly stronger signal in a large region presumably corresponding to the nucleolus . in addition the _METHOD_ protein localized also into other _LOCATION_ bodies . on the contrary free _METHOD_ control was localized diffusely in the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm but not in the nucleolus . to further specify the _METHOD_ localization in the region we used standard markers fibrillarin _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . fibrillarin is present specifically in the nucleolus _PROTEIN_ is restricted to the cajal bodies and the protein _PROTEIN_ is distributed throughout the nucleoplasm and sometimes concentrated into splicing speckles but excluded from the nucleolus . the with fibrillarin unambiguously targeted protein into the nucleolus . _METHOD_ also appeared to with a subset of cajal bodies . these cajal bodies were often localized close to the nucleolus or touching its edge in some cases they were even harboured in the nucleolus . after agnor staining the nucleolus was clearly detected as a brown spot in light microscopy and it appeared even more contrastively in uv light as a dark spot against nucleoplasm . the nucleolar size was calculated as a proportion of the area from the total _LOCATION_ area observed under uv _METHOD_ . we observed that in both wt and mutant pollen the relative nucleolar size was noticeably larger in early stages when compared with _PROTEIN_ ones _PROTEIN_ reaching its maximum in bcp . in mature pollen the nucleolus was almost undetectable . considering the mutant pollen nucleolus we observed that its relative size was constantly larger than that of pollen . the sole exception was the _PROTEIN_ where the size of both nucleoli was comparable . although several _PROTEIN_ family members are known to be involved also in the standard development stress response is considered to be the principal function of _PROTEIN_ proteins . moreover the nucleolus is well known for its functions as well . therefore we tested whether the application of _PROTEIN_ affects the pollen development . plants grown in the cultivation chamber at standard conditions were tested for pollen phenotype before the application of _PROTEIN_ . the progeny of segregating heterozygotes was used together with as a control . the phenotype of heterozygote progeny with the genotype of individual plants as expected . before _PROTEIN_ the abnormal pollen phenotype ratio was and in homozygous heterozygous and separated wt plants respectively in comparison to abnormal pollen in plants . the proportion of mgu disruption in heterozygotes approximately corresponded to one half of that in homozygotes . however after d _PROTEIN_ the pollen phenotype of plants bearing the mutation changed . most pollen phenotype disruptions were observed within homozygous plants reaching of total pollen in several individuals . on average the percentage of mgu disruptions reached in homozygous plants in heterozygotes in segregated wt plants and in . the phenotype of segregated wt plants remained more or less stable after _PROTEIN_ and was comparable to the response of control plants . on the whole the portfolio of pollen phenotype abnormalities _METHOD_ in homozygotes after the heat shock was comparable to the phenotype under standard cultivation conditions which means that the pollen with eccentric and dispersed mgu dominated among pollen abnormalities . the fitness of all observed plants during d at remained stable without any visible sign of suffering except for faster growth and branching of inflorescences .
we used insertion line from the european arabidopsis stock centre with the insert in the only exon of the _GENE_ gene . plants were grown in soil in a cultivation room at standard conditions of h day/night regime with illumination of . four pollen developmental stages including microspores bicellular pollen tricellular pollen and mature pollen grains _PROTEIN_ were separated in order to

dna denaturation and centrifuged once again . dna pellets were washed with ml of ethanol and after a final centrifugation carefully dried resuspended in and stored at . progeny of five heterozygous plants was genotyped for the segregation analysis . segregated plants of three genotypes were tested for the of the phenotype defects with the mutation . outcrosses between wild type and heterozygotes in both directions were done to check the transmission analysis . for that flowers were emasculated in flower buds isolated and pollinated in the following day when stigmas were fully developed . after the seeds developed the segregation ratio of the progeny was analysed . two sets of samples were used pollen developmental stages root stem leaf and inflorescence from wt to verify the _GENE_ gene _PROTEIN_ profile and all pollen developmental stages from mutant plants to verify the knockout or knockdown of the mrna in mutant pollen . total rna was isolated by rneasy plant mini kit from the respective samples according to the manufacturer s instruction . the quality and quantity of total rna were determined on agarose gel and spectrophotometrically . after the dnase treatment was performed using reverse transcription system with oligo or random primers and rna from or pollen cdna from wt was then used to verify the gene _PROTEIN_ profile using primers ren_f _PROTEIN_ and ren_r _PROTEIN_ and cdna from mutant plants was used to verify the knockout mutation using ctctctatgctaaaatctcg _PROTEIN_ gagataaactggagcttatg and _PROTEIN_ . because the gene has no intron to exclude the contamination by gdna the following set of primers was used for the _PROTEIN_ gene over the intron providing the pcr products of bp or bp . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was used as a reference housekeeping
