the screening of the versailles collection of arabidopsis t dna transformants allowed us to identify several male gametophytic mutants including poky pollen tube . the pok mutant which could only be isolated as a hemizygous line exhibits very short pollen tubes explaining the male specific transmission defect observed in this line . we show that the _PROTEIN_ gene is duplicated in the arabidopsis genome and that the predicted _PROTEIN_ protein sequence is highly conserved from lower to higher eukaryotes . the putative _PROTEIN_ homolog in yeast referred to as has been shown to be located at the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ and to function in a complex with other proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and . this complex is involved in retrograde trafficking of vesicles between the early endosomal compartment and the trans _LOCATION_ network . we present the _PROTEIN_ patterns of the _PROTEIN_ gene and its duplicate in arabidopsis and of the putative arabidopsis homologs of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ of yeast . we show that a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein localizes to _LOCATION_ in plant cells supporting the possibility of a conserved function for and _PROTEIN_ proteins . these results together with the _PROTEIN_ pattern of the _PROTEIN_ gus fusion and the lack of plants homozygous for the pok mutation suggest a more general role for _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ growth beyond the pollen tube elongation process .
in order to define the pok phenotype in situ aniline blue staining was performed after limited pollination of wild type pistils with pollen grains either from wild type or from hemizygous pok plants . sixteen hours after pollination all wild type pollen grains had germinated and completely elongated their pollen tubes reaching the base of the ovary . the number of pollen tubes counted in the style was similar to the number of pollen grains deposited . on the contrary pollen from pok plants produced both elongated and short pollen tubes . when only one or two grains were deposited we commonly observed short poky pollen tubes h after pollination which are presumed to carry the t dna construct . this observation is consistent with a role for the _PROTEIN_ gene in pollen tube growth in vivo . nonetheless some pollen tubes were still able to elongate sufficiently to reach ovules located in the upper part of the ovary . this would explain the residual male gametophytic t dna transmission in the pok mutant line . despite this residual transmission numerous screens to isolate homozygous pok plants remained unsuccessful suggesting that homozygous pok mutations lead to precocious lethality . genomic regions flanking the single t dna construct inserted in the pok mutant line were cloned and sequenced leading to the identification of a pair of duplicated genes located kb apart on the bottom of chromosome i the _PROTEIN_ gene in which the t dna insertion occurred and the gene . the _PROTEIN_ and genes are composed of and exons respectively _PROTEIN_ . the exon intron structure is strictly conserved and exon sequences share identity whereas intron sequences are largely divergent and shorter in than in _PROTEIN_ . pok hemizygous mutant plants were complemented with an kb genomic clone overlapping the _PROTEIN_ gene but excluding . the complementation construct was linked to the hpt gene whereas the pok t dna insertion was marked with the nptii gene conferring hygromycin and kanamycin resistance respectively to the transformed plants . among the progeny of infiltrated mutant plants five plants were selected that when selfed showed segregation for kanamycin resistance instead of observed in the pok mutant . furthermore these five plants showed segregation for hygromycin resistance as expected in the case of independent segregation of both t dna insertions . the self progeny of one of these potentially complemented plants was analyzed . descendants homozygous for hygromycin resistance either were also homozygous for kanamycin resistance or showed a ratio of kanamycin resistant to kanamycin sensitive progeny . crossing these latter plants as male in with wild type confirmed that t dna transmission was restored . moreover descendants that had lost the complementing construct showed segregation for kanamycin resistance . finally when germinating pollen from a complemented descendant in vitro the same proportion of elongated pollen tubes was obtained as for wild type pollen showing phenotypic restoration for this plant . in the control hemizygous pok line of elongated pollen tubes were counted out of pollen grains . to rule out potential lesions in the linked gene the genomic region was completely sequenced in the pok mutant and no mutations were observed . taken together these data confirm that the t dna insertion in the _PROTEIN_ gene alone is responsible for the observed tip growth defect in pok plants . northern blotting experiments using exon of the _PROTEIN_ gene as a probe revealed a transcript of the expected size at every developmental stage tested and in almost all plant tissues . however there was some variation in transcript abundance very low levels of transcripts were detected in seeds whole inflorescence and mature flowers while higher levels were observed in roots and flower buds less than mm in size . due to their strong identity the _PROTEIN_ and transcripts could not be distinguished in hybridization experiments . however oligonucleotides specific for each cdna were designed and reverse transcription pcr analysis was used to characterize the _PROTEIN_ pattern of both transcripts independently . for the _PROTEIN_ gene rt pcr results although not quantitative were qualitatively similar to those obtained by northern blotting with the _PROTEIN_ cdna detected in all tissues although at very low levels in seeds . for the cdna no rt pcr products were detected in any sample even after two rounds of nested amplification . taken together the weak or absent _PROTEIN_ of versus _PROTEIN_ and the presence of the _PROTEIN_ cdna in all rt pcr samples argue that the northern blot analysis shown in figure faithfully reflects _PROTEIN_ mrna distribution only . pollen and root cdna libraries were screened with a probe corresponding to the t dna insertion region and overlapping the predicted exon of the _PROTEIN_ gene . two types of clones were obtained from the pollen cdna library a _PROTEIN_ partial cdna clone and a cdna clone . the screening of the root cdna library allowed the isolation of a longer _PROTEIN_ cdna clone however no cdna clone for the gene was found . putative initiator _PROTEIN_ for both transcripts located in exon predict a total length for _PROTEIN_ and coding sequences of and nt respectively . experiments using _PROTEIN_ specific primers indicated a of to nt located to nt upstream of the terminus of the root cdna . the _PROTEIN_ and predicted proteins are and amino acids respectively with a predicted molecular _METHOD_ of approximately kd . both proteins share identity and similarity . according to blast software _PROTEIN_ shows identity and similarity with the yeast protein . predicted homologous proteins are also found in other species such as homo sapiens drosophila melanogaster and caenorhabditis elegans with to identity and to similarity over the entire sequences . although some amino acids appear well conserved among the different species no particular structure signal peptide or known motifs are predicted in the _PROTEIN_ sequence . citation showed that the yeast protein functions in complex with two other proteins called _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . we therefore searched for arabidopsis genes encoding potential homologs of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . performing blast analysis we identified two candidate genes that we called _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the corresponding predicted proteins share respectively and identity and and similarity with their yeast counterparts . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cdna clones were isolated from the pollen cdna library . they are both kb long and contain and exons respectively . the predicted proteins contain and amino acids respectively compared to and amino acids for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . a predicted translation start for the _PROTEIN_ transcript is located in the middle of exon . for _PROTEIN_ genscan software predicts a long exon but rt pcr experiments did not allow amplification of this region . the first in frame _PROTEIN_ of the isolated _PROTEIN_ pollen cdna is located at the end of exon which would give rise to a amino acid protein . _PROTEIN_ of these two vps like genes was studied by northern blot analysis . as observed for _PROTEIN_ both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ . their basal _PROTEIN_ level is low although higher for _PROTEIN_ compared to _PROTEIN_ in all vegetative tissues and higher for _PROTEIN_ in roots versus other tissues . in reproductive tissues both transcripts are more abundant in buds less than mm in size compared with _PROTEIN_ stages . since an active translational fusion between the first exons of the _PROTEIN_ gene and the uida gene carried by the t dna occurred in the pok mutant gus staining allowed us to determine a preliminary _PROTEIN_ pattern for the _PROTEIN_ protein . in to d old plantlets strong blue staining was detected in the root apex with enhanced intensity in the elongation zone in emerging _PROTEIN_ root primordia in very young leaves and sometimes in _PROTEIN_ . in reproductive tissues gus staining was observed at different stages of floral development . blue coloration was detected from the earliest stages of flower development before meiosis and gametogenesis and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . as flower bud size reached to mm _PROTEIN_ of the fusion protein became strictly gametophytic in the male reproductive tissues whereas it was clearly sporophytic in the female tissues since all ovules were stained . at maturity half of the pollen grains within the anthers were blue as expected for hemizygous plants . at _PROTEIN_ postpollination stages all developing seeds were stained . however no blue staining was observed in the pistil below the stigma surface compared to a control line _PROTEIN_ gus in pollen and for which a blue coloration was observed in the style corresponding to elongated pollen tubes . the absence of staining in the style of the pok mutant could be the result of lower gus _PROTEIN_ in this line compared to our control line as well as of lack of effective pok pollen tube growth . the subcellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein was investigated using a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion construct containing the complete open reading frame of the _PROTEIN_ gene fused with the _METHOD_ coding sequence . both cdnas were cloned downstream of kb of the predicted _PROTEIN_ promoter region . onion epidermal cells were bombarded with this _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct . the collected signal exhibited a cytoplasmic dispersed punctate pattern characteristic of the previously described _LOCATION_ distribution pattern in plant cells . onion cells were also cobombarded with both the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct and a _PROTEIN_ dsred construct where the signal anchor sequence of the rat sialyltransferase gene was used as a _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ marker . both _METHOD_ and dsred signals exhibited a very similar distribution within the cell . the overlay and coincidence of both signals strongly suggests that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein localizes to _LOCATION_ in onion epidermal cells .
