the family proteins are involved in several aspects of chromatin function and regulation in drosophila mammals and the fission yeast . here we investigate the localization of _PROTEIN_ the unique arabidopsis thaliana homolog known at present time to approach its function . a functional _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein able to restore the wild type phenotype in the _PROTEIN_ mutant was used to analyze the subnuclear distribution of _PROTEIN_ in both a. thaliana and nicotiana tabacum . in a. thaliana interphase _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ was predominantly located outside the heterochromatic chromocenters . no major aberrations were observed in heterochromatin content or chromocenter organization in _PROTEIN_ plants . these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ involved in euchromatin organization in a. thaliana . in tobacco by cells the _PROTEIN_ distribution although in foci slightly differed suggesting that _PROTEIN_ localization is determined by the underlying genome organization of plant species . truncated _PROTEIN_ proteins _PROTEIN_ in vivo allowed us to determine the function of the different segments in the localization . the in foci distribution is dependent on the presence of the two chromo domains whereas the hinge region has some nucleolus targeting properties . furthermore like the animal and subtypes _PROTEIN_ dissociates from chromosomes during mitosis . in transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein two major localization patterns were observed according to cell types suggesting that localization evolves with age or differentiation states . our results show conversed characteristics of the a. thaliana homolog with the mammal isoform besides specific plant properties .
previous experiments in tobacco protoplasts have shown a _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein with a specific foci distribution . these preliminary observations were realized after transient _PROTEIN_ in a heterologous system . to further investigate the subnuclear localization of _PROTEIN_ in planta we stably introduced a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion construct into a. thaliana wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . several independent transgenic lines were obtained of which six lines were further analyzed . based on plant morphology and architecture three phenotypic groups could be identified . the transgenic plants in the first group had similar phenotype to _PROTEIN_ or an even more affected phenotype _PROTEIN_ . the second group contained plants with an intermediary phenotype while in the third one restoration of a normal rosette and leaf phenotypes was observed . flowering time phenotypes of the transgenic plants were recorded and revealed partial restoration especially in sd . the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype being very pleiotropic the degree of restoration slightly varied according to observed phenotypic traits . the level of _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene was recorded by semi quantitative rt pcr for each line and the data showed a good correlation between the phenotype and the level of transgene _PROTEIN_ . plants with normal rosettes showed a high level of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ whereas a low level of _PROTEIN_ was found in plants with the mutant phenotype . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ of the first and third groups differed by a _PROTEIN_ . therefore we conclude that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion is functional in planta being able to restore most of the pleiotropic traits of the _PROTEIN_ mutant such as leaf morphology and plant architecture . wild type plants were also transformed with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct and did not show any peculiar phenotype . _PROTEIN_ localization studies were performed in both and transgenic lines both of which have a phenotype close to normal . similar _METHOD_ _METHOD_ patterns were observed in the two lines . a _METHOD_ nucleoplasm with small _METHOD_ foci was observed with exclusion from the nucleolus . to determine the nature of the _PROTEIN_ foci the _METHOD_ and dapi _METHOD_ patterns were compared . line scan analysis generally revealed no overlap of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals with dapi bright chromocenters . these are known to be the _LOCATION_ domains of heterochromatin in a. thaliana . partial overlap between _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and chromocenters was observed in less than of the cases . these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ associated with the euchromatic fraction . to define whether _PROTEIN_ has impacts on chromatin organization we examined the heterochromatin content in wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant _LOCATION_ . dapi staining was performed on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and wild type _LOCATION_ isolated from different organs and the heterochromatin fraction was determined . to minimize the developmental differences between the wild type plant and the _PROTEIN_ mutant which flowers earlier than the wild type we examined _LOCATION_ from sepals and _PROTEIN_ isolated at the same developmental stage . the shape size or number of chromocenters did not significantly differ between _PROTEIN_ and wild type _LOCATION_ neither did the relative heterochromatic fractions . in rosette leaves the rhf slightly varied in wild type plants during the analyzed developmental window and to a lower extent in the mutants . this could suggest a minor role for _PROTEIN_ in heterochromatin formation during development or cell differentiation . to test a further role of _PROTEIN_ in the organization of heterochromatic chromocenters fish experiments were carried out using the centromeric pb repeat rdna pericentromeric and rdna probes . the corresponding genomic sequences were previously shown in chromocenters . no major differences in their organization could be observed between mutant and wild type plants . to examine if the _PROTEIN_ mutation affects chromatin condensation treatments with the micrococcus aureus mnase were performed on wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant _LOCATION_ . at a global level chromatin of _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ was more rapidly digested than wild type chromatin suggesting a higher accessibility to nucleases and consequently a lower compaction level . as heterochromatin represents only a reduced fraction of the a. thaliana genome these significant differences are likely to concern the euchromatic fraction of the genome . to test whether the genome organization has effects on the lhp _METHOD_ localization and whether _PROTEIN_ function may diverge in different species the fusion protein was introduced into n. tabacum which has a genome times larger than the a. thaliana genome . several independent transgenic tobacco tby cell lines _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein were generated and analyzed . all transgenic lines presented the same localization pattern . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was visible in the _LOCATION_ as bright _METHOD_ _METHOD_ foci dispersed in a _METHOD_ nucleoplasm but excluded from the nucleolus . in tby _LOCATION_ intense dapi stained regions have been distinguished although these regions were less precisely defined and more diffused than the dapi stained chromocenters in a. thaliana . combined _METHOD_ and dapi _METHOD_ detection as well as line scan analysis of the superimposed images revealed that most of the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ foci overlapped with dapi stained domains . to better understand the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ distribution in tobacco we investigated the nature of dapi stained regions in tby by fish experiments and immunolabeling experiments using antibodies against two hallmarks of silent chromatin the methyl cytosine and methylated histone at lysine position . by using a ribosomal dna repeat probe specific of the nor regions we showed that dapi stained regions did not overlap with the nor regions . the labeling was distributed in the whole nucleoplasm with exclusion of brightly stained foci . in metaphase chromosomes these empty segments may correspond very well with _PROTEIN_ rich regions . the presence of large dapi positive _PROTEIN_ rich segments in tobacco and other plant species is known from several studies . however such large _PROTEIN_ rich segments are not present in the a. thaliana genome . consistent with this observation the distribution was also uniform throughout the _LOCATION_ with exclusion from the nucleolar regions . these results suggest that in tobacco no particularly enriched regions in the or can be distinguished . chromatin associated with these two epigenetic marks is spread in the whole _LOCATION_ and no discrete heterochromatic regions such as the a. thaliana chromocenters can be distinguished . to examine the role of the structural subdomains of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ localization of the protein truncated _PROTEIN_ proteins including various combinations of the cd the csd and the hr were fused to _METHOD_ . as the lhpcsd region lacks a _LOCATION_ localization signal the functional bipartite nls signal of the a. tumefaciens protein was fused to the _PROTEIN_ terminal region of the lhpcsd _METHOD_ protein . deletion constructs were introduced into the tobacco tby cell line . for each construct the different transgenic lines gave similar patterns . localization was also analyzed in arabidopsis protoplasts in transient _PROTEIN_ . all truncated _PROTEIN_ proteins fused to _METHOD_ were targeted to the _LOCATION_ indicating that at least three out of the five classical nls are functional in _PROTEIN_ both in n. tabacum and a. thaliana . and which form a classical bipartite nls were present in all constructs and may be the major nls . when lhpn lhpnh or lhpcsd were fused to _METHOD_ a _METHOD_ distribution was observed throughout the _LOCATION_ with nucleolar exclusion and a variable number of foci . in n. tabacum removal of one of the cds or csd resulted in smaller and less numerous foci whereas in a. thaliana foci disappeared . these data may result from the properties of the cd in recognition of chromatin hallmarks and dimerisation property associated with the csd . thus the cd and csd have appeared in plants as the _PROTEIN_ domains involved in foci formation . both chromodomains were required in a. thaliana protoplasts whereas in n. tabacum cells some foci still can be observed with one of them . interestingly as shown in fig . h respectively the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or lhph _METHOD_ fusions which both contain the hr were targeted to the nucleolus whereas the entire _PROTEIN_ protein or the three other constructs were _PROTEIN_ excluded from that _LOCATION_ compartment both in a. thaliana and in n. tabacum . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signal in the nucleolus seemed to be more intense with the lhpc construct compared to lhph but the distribution more homogenous with lhph . sequence comparisons with functionally identified nucleolar localization signals suggested the presence of a putative nols in the _PROTEIN_ hr formed by two stretches enriched in lysine and arginine residues and flanked by one glutamine . thus either the truncated proteins may simply be stored in that compartment due to the deletion of functional domains or the two deletions may induce conformational changes such as the unmasking of a cryptic nols which could relocate the protein to the nucleolus . the in planta localization of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion was analyzed in different tissues and at different developmental stages in a. thaliana . two _PROTEIN_ patterns were observed according to cell types or tissues . the most common pattern described above as in foci pattern was observed in cells located in older parts of the root and in most of the differentiated cells of the aerial vegetative tissues such as hypocotyl epidermis guard cells parenchyma . the second pattern was a uniform _METHOD_ distribution throughout the _LOCATION_ but excluded from the nucleolus . this uniform pattern was observed in _LOCATION_ of young proliferating tissue such as the root apex young hypocotyls cotyledon cells from immature seeds and young apical meristematic cells . _LOCATION_ in older root hairs displayed more foci than those in younger root hairs which tend to have a more uniform pattern . due to the larger chromosome size of tobacco and the high mitotic index of tby cells the chromosome association of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was monitored during mitosis in the transgenic _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tobacco cell line . to better visualize mitosis events synchronizations of tby transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion were performed using a combination of aphidicolin and propizamide . during prophase the foci distribution disappeared progressively and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ dropped being hardly visible at metaphase . only a very weak _METHOD_ halo was detected around the metaphase plaque in the ancient _LOCATION_ territory . progressively a _METHOD_ signal reappeared concomitant with the segregation of the chromosomes and their decondensation . from _PROTEIN_ anaphase to telophase _METHOD_ foci reappeared until the classical distribution was observed when _LOCATION_ have divided . similar observations were made in mitotic cells located in a. thaliana root apex .
