glutamyl transpeptidase is the enzyme responsible for breaking the glutamyl bond between glu and cys in glutathione . we are using this gene family to study gsh degradation in plants . there are four putative ggt genes in arabidopsis and one of them _PROTEIN_ is analyzed in this study . _PROTEIN_ is localized to the _LOCATION_ based on organelle targeting _METHOD_ subcellular distribution of _METHOD_ fusion proteins during transient _PROTEIN_ in onion epidermal tissues and its ability to metabolize _LOCATION_ substrates in arabidopsis plants . while northern blots and promoter gus _PROTEIN_ patterns have suggested that _PROTEIN_ is transcribed at relatively high levels in all parts of the plant a comparison of enzyme activities in different organs of wild type and a _PROTEIN_ knockout mutant showed that _PROTEIN_ was a major contributor to total ggt activity in roots but a relatively minor contributor in other tissues . wild type arabidopsis plants treated with monobromobimane form a _METHOD_ gsh mbb conjugate that is moved into the _LOCATION_ and then metabolized to cys gly mbb and cys mbb in that order . the first step is catalyzed by _PROTEIN_ and gsh mbb metabolism is completely blocked in the roots of _PROTEIN_ knockout plants . in _PROTEIN_ leaves some gsh mbb metabolism still proceeds using the apoplastic _PROTEIN_ . this identifies _PROTEIN_ as catalyzing the obligate initial step in gsh conjugate metabolism and suggests that it has an important role in protecting plants from some xenobiotic chemicals .
in order to determine where _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ rna blot analysis was performed using a genomic clone for _PROTEIN_ as a probe . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ appears to be universally _PROTEIN_ in all arabidopsis organs at fairly high levels . the tissue specificity of _PROTEIN_ was determined by fusing the entire bp region upstream from the _PROTEIN_ orf to the orf of the next gene to the gus reporter gene and transforming it into arabidopsis plants . three independent lines were selected for further analysis and plants carrying the t dna in the homozygous state were studied in each line . gus staining was observed in all organs such as rosette leaves flowers siliques _METHOD_ and roots . this was in good agreement with rna blot analysis . there was no obvious tissue specificity of gus _PROTEIN_ in any organ except in siliques . in siliques gus was observed only in pedicels and tips . the same trends were observed in all three independent lines . to study the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ in living cells green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ was fused downstream of the _PROTEIN_ orf and placed under the control of the camv promoter . the construct was _PROTEIN_ transiently in epidermal cells of onions by microprojectile bombardment . as a control free _METHOD_ was also _PROTEIN_ . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was analyzed with a _METHOD_ microscope . when _METHOD_ was fused to the full length _PROTEIN_ orf or the n terminal amino acids of the _PROTEIN_ orf _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was not observed . this might have occurred because these fusion proteins were unstable . when _METHOD_ was fused to the n terminal amino acids of the _PROTEIN_ orf _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed . these amino acids contain the whole unique n terminal extension of _PROTEIN_ . as shown in figure _METHOD_ from _METHOD_ fused with the _PROTEIN_ n terminal amino acids was observed in almost the whole interior of the cells whereas free _METHOD_ predominantly localized in the _LOCATION_ and in the thin _LOCATION_ layer underlying the cell _LOCATION_ . when cells were placed in w/v mannitol solution the cell _LOCATION_ were plasmolyzed by osmotic pressure . _METHOD_ from the _METHOD_ fused with the _PROTEIN_ n terminus was observed inside the shrunken cell _LOCATION_ while free _METHOD_ again localized predominantly in the _LOCATION_ and around the cell _LOCATION_ . most of the volume of mature plant cells is occupied by a large _LOCATION_ . therefore localization of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion is consistent with _PROTEIN_ being localized within the _LOCATION_ as predicted by computer analysis of the n terminus of the protein . when the microscope was focused through the _LOCATION_ no enrichment of the _METHOD_ signal was observed near the inner surface of the organelle . this suggests that the protein is not tonoplast associated but rather free within the _LOCATION_ . to investigate the function of _PROTEIN_ in planta the _PROTEIN_ knockout line was obtained from the ds transposon insertion lines at the nottingham arabidopsis stock centre . homozygous progeny with a single transposon insertion were selected by pcr and dna gel blot hybridization analyses . the insertion was located in the third exon of the _PROTEIN_ gene . northern gel blot analysis was performed with rna from wild type and the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants using the _PROTEIN_ orf as a probe . a band with a larger size was observed in the _PROTEIN_ plants compared with that of wild type suggesting that a portion of the ds transposon was transcribed together with part of the _PROTEIN_ gene in the _PROTEIN_ plants . the disruption in the center of the open reading frame and the failure of the mutant to produce normal _PROTEIN_ mrna suggest that functional _PROTEIN_ protein was not produced in the _PROTEIN_ plants . the _PROTEIN_ plants were grown on soil under normal conditions until they set seed . no visible differences were observed in the knockout plants compared with wild type plants . ggt activities in various organs of the _PROTEIN_ plants were determined . compared with activities in wild type plants total ggt activity in the roots of the _PROTEIN_ plants was significantly _PROTEIN_ by . in other organs such as leaves siliques flowers and _METHOD_ ggt activities in the _PROTEIN_ plants were of those in wild type plants . in the _PROTEIN_ knockout plants ggt activity was about in roots in siliques and in other organs compared with that measured in wild type plants . in the _PROTEIN_ knockout plants activity in siliques was of wild type activity with no significant difference in other organs . taken together the loss of activity caused by each of the knockout mutants for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ added together for each organ was equal to the total ggt activities in wild type plants . further support that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ contribute all detectable ggt activity in organs other than in siliques comes from analysis of a _PROTEIN_ double knockout mutant . there was no detectable ggt activity from these plants in any organs other than siliques . the activity in siliques of _PROTEIN_ double knockout plants is derived from _PROTEIN_ activity . this supports our earlier assumption based on an inability to find mrna that the partial ggt gene _PROTEIN_ is a pseudogene and does not produce a functional protein . in siliques ggt activity in the _PROTEIN_ double knockout mutant plants was of that in wild type plants . roots of liquid cultured week old plants leaves from soil grown week old plants and siliques flowers and _METHOD_ from soil grown week old plants were harvested and assayed for ggt activity . means sd of or biological replicates from different groups of plants are shown . asterisk indicates significant difference between wild type and the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . the gsh ec and cys concentrations of the _PROTEIN_ plants were determined in roots from week old plants leaves from week old plants and rosette leaves cauline leaves _METHOD_ flower buds flowers and siliques from week old plants . no difference in thiol levels was observed compared with wild type plants in all organs examined . toxic xenobiotics are conjugated with gsh and sequestered into the _LOCATION_ . as the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein is localized to the inside of the _LOCATION_ the in vivo degradation of gsh conjugates in the _LOCATION_ was analyzed in the _PROTEIN_ plants to determine whether _PROTEIN_ contributes to gsh conjugate degradation in this organelle . monobromobimane was used as a model substrate for the analysis . mbb fluoresces when conjugated with thiols . previously citation showed in arabidopsis roots incubated with bimane that most of the _METHOD_ initially formed in the _LOCATION_ was either due to the high concentration of gsh in this space or the presence of a _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ that catalyzed much of this reaction . the gsh bimane conjugate was then transported from the _LOCATION_ into the _LOCATION_ and within h after labeling all of the _METHOD_ was found in that organelle . in our study we traced mbb conjugated metabolites both in roots and leaves using hplc to follow the formation and degradation of gsh bimane conjugate . as a first step the time course of gsh mbb degradation was examined in roots of wild type plants . mbb was added to the liquid culture medium of week old arabidopsis plants . during the h treatment with mbb enough gsh mbb conjugate was formed to account for all the gsh before treatment . after h excess mbb was washed out of the roots with mbb free medium and the plants were further grown for up to h as indicated . mbb conjugated metabolites were then extracted from roots and analyzed by hplc . in the roots of wild type plants gsh mbb _PROTEIN_ to a quarter of its initial level in the first h and further _PROTEIN_ over an additional h. as the gsh mbb conjugate was metabolized the level of cys mbb increased fivefold during the h incubation . _METHOD_ balance analysis suggested that the initial mbb treatment produced a small amount of cys mbb and several fold more gsh mbb . the presence of similar cys mbb levels in the _PROTEIN_ knockout suggests that this cys mbb resulted directly from the reaction of cys and mbb . during the next h the gsh mbb was stoichiometrically converted into cys mbb . the cys mbb did not appear to be further metabolized during the h of this experiment . the in vivo degradation of gsh mbb was next investigated in roots of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants . as most of the degradation occurred in the first h in the time course analysis and no further metabolism occurred up to h mbb conjugated metabolites were extracted at and h after washing out the unreacted mbb . in wild type plants the concentration of gsh mbb _PROTEIN_ from to h and from to h whereas cys mbb levels increased fold from to h and fold from to h . there was no significant difference in gsh mbb and cys mbb levels between the _PROTEIN_ plants and wild type plants at all time points . in contrast in the _PROTEIN_ plants neither the gsh mbb or cys mbb levels changed significantly from h to h . thus disrupting _PROTEIN_ activity in roots completely blocked gsh mbb metabolism . concentrations of cys gly mbb in roots were also determined . cys gly mbb was detected in wild type plants and _PROTEIN_ plants only at and h without a significant difference between them but this product of the ggt reaction was not detected in the _PROTEIN_ mutants at any time point . there was no difference in ec mbb levels in either the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutants compared with the wild type plants . these data strongly suggest that the _PROTEIN_ protein is primarily responsible for the initial degradation of gsh conjugates in the _LOCATION_ . in addition they show that degradation initiates from the n terminus to produce cys gly conjugates . otherwise we would have seen a time dependent increase in the levels of ec mbb in the _PROTEIN_ mutant where it could not be processed further . only after the glu is removed did the dipeptidase proceed to remove the gly residue to leave cys mbb . ec is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of gsh and these data suggest that it has no role in gsh conjugate breakdown . interestingly the presence of cys mbb and ec mbb in the _PROTEIN_ plants can only be explained by the direct reaction between endogenous cysteine and monobromobimane in vivo . this shows that mbb reacts directly with cysteine and ec and by extension at least in part with gsh in a reaction that does not require _PROTEIN_ . the _LOCATION_ enzyme _PROTEIN_ contributes about half of the ggt activity in roots while the _LOCATION_ enzyme _PROTEIN_ provides over of the activity in leaves . in order to investigate the physiological significance of this organ specific distribution in vivo degradation of mbb conjugates was next investigated in leaves . mbb solution was vacuum infiltrated into leaves and the leaves were incubated for h in the mbb solution . the mbb conjugated metabolites were extracted from leaves at or h after washing out excess mbb . as the efficiency of infiltrations differed between leaves the percentage of total thiol levels was calculated . the percentage of total thiols in gsh mbb _PROTEIN_ from at h to at h in wild type plants showing that the degradation of gsh mbb was much slower in leaves than in roots where gsh mbb _PROTEIN_ to less than of its initial levels by h. this is consistent with the lower ggt activity from the _PROTEIN_ protein in wild type leaves compared with roots based on activity of the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . the percentage of gsh mbb at h was significantly higher in the _PROTEIN_ mutants than in wild type leaves and the level of cys mbb at h in the _PROTEIN_ mutant leaves was half that of wild type leaves . this shows that even though the rate of degradation of gsh mbb to cys mbb was lower in leaves than roots the majority of metabolism still proceeded through _PROTEIN_ based on the inhibition in the _PROTEIN_ plants . in the _PROTEIN_ plants no significant difference was observed in gsh mbb and cys mbb but the percentage of cys gly mbb was significantly lower than that of wild type plants at both time points . the _PROTEIN_ of cys gly mbb in the _PROTEIN_ mutant and the presence of gsh mbb degradation products such as cys gly mbb and cys mbb in the _PROTEIN_ plants show that some _LOCATION_ degradation of the gsh conjugate by _PROTEIN_ is occurring in leaves . the percentage of ec mbb did not differ between wild type plants and both mutant plants again supporting the conclusion that ec is not an intermediate in gsh degradation . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is induced by xenobiotics mrna accumulation in response to dichlorophenoxyacetic acid which is a substrate for _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis was determined by real time pcr . relative mrna accumulation of _PROTEIN_ relative to the actin control was increased by d treatment while the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ was not changed .
