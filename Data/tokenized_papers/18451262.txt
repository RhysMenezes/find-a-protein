salicylic acid is an important mediator of plant defense response . in arabidopsis this compound was proposed to derive _PROTEIN_ from isochorismate itself produced from _PROTEIN_ through the activity of isochorismate _PROTEIN_ . null _PROTEIN_ mutants still accumulate some sa suggesting the existence of an enzymatic activity redundant with _PROTEIN_ or of an alternative ics independent sa biosynthetic route . here we studied the role of _PROTEIN_ a second ics gene of the arabidopsis genome in the production of sa . we have shown that _PROTEIN_ encodes a functional ics enzyme and that similar to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is targeted to the _LOCATION_ . comparison of sa accumulation in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants indicates that _PROTEIN_ participates in the synthesis of sa but in limited amounts that become clearly detectable only when _PROTEIN_ is lacking . this unequal redundancy relationship was also observed for _PROTEIN_ another isochorismate derived end product . furthermore detection of sa in the double _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant that is completely devoid of _PROTEIN_ provides genetic evidence of the existence of an ics independent sa biosynthetic pathway in arabidopsis .
two isochorismate synthase genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are present in the genome of arabidopsis . these two genes belong to two blocks of approximately mb containing ordered fragments of similar sequence and therefore presumably originate from an ancient genomic duplication event . we first obtained a complete sequence of _PROTEIN_ to compare the nucleotide sequences of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . no full length _PROTEIN_ cdna sequence was available from public databases and the current conceptual translation of the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence relying on ests predicted an _PROTEIN_ protein sequence lacking an n terminal extension compared to _PROTEIN_ . we have isolated the end of the _PROTEIN_ messenger by using the _PROTEIN_ pcr technique and then its full length coding sequence by reverse transcription pcr . we found that the most located est matched our _PROTEIN_ cdna sequence but started at position only and so therefore did not include the first _PROTEIN_ start codon located at position and suggested an _LOCATION_ start codon . the translation of the complete _PROTEIN_ coding sequence includes an n terminal extension predicted to be a _LOCATION_ targeting peptide unlike the current annotation for _PROTEIN_ but similar to _PROTEIN_ . overall _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ share identity and similarity at the amino acid level and are close to the characterized c. roseus crics _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and crics contain the so called _PROTEIN_ binding domain and conserved key residues consistent with an ics catalytic activity . at the genomic level the _PROTEIN_ gene contains exons compared to for _PROTEIN_ but the overall exon/intron organization has been retained since the event that duplicated the ics genes . minor exceptions are the splitting of exons and of _PROTEIN_ into exons to of _PROTEIN_ or alternatively the fusion of exons to of _PROTEIN_ into exons and of _PROTEIN_ . analysis of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ sequences with targetp and predotar software suggested that both proteins contained a _LOCATION_ targeting signal . the predicted localization in _LOCATION_ is consistent with the production of the _PROTEIN_ substrate in these organelles . _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was tested by fusing their coding sequence to _METHOD_ and transiently _PROTEIN_ these constructs in tobacco cells . observations of the transformed cells with a laser confocal microscope clearly showed that the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ colocalized with chlorophyll _METHOD_ indicating that both fusion proteins were located within the chloroplasts . as a control we _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ alone following the same protocol and observed a _LOCATION_ signal . _PROTEIN_ was initially proposed to catalyze the conversion of _PROTEIN_ into isochorismate based on sequence similarity with a characterized ics from c. roseus . to determine experimentally whether _PROTEIN_ but also _PROTEIN_ truly possess such an ics enzymatic activity we relied on a functional complementation assay . in escherichia coli an endogenous ics activity is required for production of enterobactin a high affinity iron ligand secreted in the medium and internalized following iron chelation . iron scavenging by _METHOD_ can be monitored easily using the chrome azurol sulfonate medium devised by citation . this medium contains a dye that _METHOD_ an intense blue complex with iron and turns orange when iron has been transferred to another iron binding molecule . for our functional assay we used _PROTEIN_ a mutant of e. coli that lacks endogenous ics activity and is therefore unable to produce enterobactin . as a positive control we have used the e. coli entc gene encoding an ics that restored enterobactin production after introduction into the _PROTEIN_ strain and entailed the formation of an orange halo around positive colonies . _PROTEIN_ cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of the strong isopropylthio galactoside inducible ptac promoter also showed an orange halo even without induction by iptg indicating that _PROTEIN_ could complement the _PROTEIN_ ics deficiency . no significant coloration was observed for cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under the same conditions . however induction by iptg at mm led to the appearance of the orange signature for siderophore production thus demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ encodes functional ics enzymes similarly to _PROTEIN_ . the apparent difference of response to iptg between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the cas assay was not due to variations of the _PROTEIN_ system because both were cloned in the same vector under the control of the same promoter and untranslated region after removal of the transit peptide coding sequence . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ due to codon bias were also prevented by using the prare plasmid throughout the experiment . instead we observed that the _PROTEIN_ protein accumulated at much lower levels than _PROTEIN_ in e. coli cells by using tagged versions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in e. coli also allowed us to test whether these two enzymes could generate sa directly from _PROTEIN_ . no sa accumulated in cell cultures unlike cells _PROTEIN_ the positive control pchb from pseudomonas aeruginosa therefore suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have no isochorismate pyruvate lyase activity . to determine the relative contribution of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to isochorismate production we used the following mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . neither of these single mutants exhibited a striking visual phenotype compared to the wild type . we focused our study on _PROTEIN_ and sa presumably both derived from isochorismate in arabidopsis . _PROTEIN_ was measured in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant lines by _METHOD_ hplc after reduction of _PROTEIN_ to the _PROTEIN_ form according to citation . the pylloquinone content in leaves of _PROTEIN_ was reduced to approximately of wild type indicating that the _PROTEIN_ gene product provides the predominant amount of isochorismate required for _PROTEIN_ synthesis . the amount of _PROTEIN_ of the homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant was not different from wild type . although the _PROTEIN_ content in _PROTEIN_ was strongly reduced the total chlorophyll content was not affected _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the functional overlap between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was investigated in double homozygous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants . plants derived from a cross of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were raised on suc containing medium and screened for double homozygous lines by _PROTEIN_ measurements and by pcr using oligonucleotides designed for the _PROTEIN_ locus . double homozygous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants remained smaller than the wild type and single mutants and displayed a pale green to yellowish pigmentation . besides this strong reduction in growth they could only be _PROTEIN_ on suc medium . the novel growth defects present in the double mutant compared to the single mutants indicated that both genes were dispensable but not together and that at least one was required and sufficient for normal growth under these conditions . this defines a symmetrical or equal redundancy between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with respect to the ability to grow under standard conditions . double homozygous mutant lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were totally devoid of _PROTEIN_ . plants homozygous for the _PROTEIN_ mutation but heterozygous for _PROTEIN_ contained significantly less _PROTEIN_ than _PROTEIN_ single mutants suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ enzyme becomes limiting for isochorismate production in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background . sa is presumed to derive from isochorismate in arabidopsis because sa accumulation was shown to be severely impaired in the _PROTEIN_ mutant upon inducing conditions . we have analyzed the induction of sa accumulation in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants after uv treatment a known stimulus for sa accumulation . as expected the _PROTEIN_ mutant accumulated roughly of total sa compared to the wild type . the mean value for the _PROTEIN_ mutant was similar to the wild type reference . therefore in the wild type the _PROTEIN_ mutation does not have a high impact on sa accumulation upon uv exposure or in a noninduced state . this result was expected following the simple reasoning that if _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were independently regulated and _PROTEIN_ accounted for approximately of the total amount of isochorismate produced in these conditions _PROTEIN_ then _PROTEIN_ at best would contribute to only of isochorismate production in these conditions and consequently an _PROTEIN_ mutant should not be strongly affected in sa accumulation . we then determined whether _PROTEIN_ was required for the production of the remaining sa in the _PROTEIN_ mutant and evaluated the genetic relationship between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the course of sa biosynthesis after uv induction using the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . without any induction _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants accumulated approximately of total sa relative to the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the difference in sa accumulation between the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants can be assigned to the activity of the _PROTEIN_ gene product . the same effect was observed after uv stimulation because the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant produced total sa in a similar range of about relative to the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the structure of sa in the double mutant was verified by gas chromatography _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . these results imply that _PROTEIN_ can be involved in sa biosynthesis through isochorismate production however its contribution is marginal compared to _PROTEIN_ . because the values before and after uv induction are not statistically very different both for the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants we can further conclude that unlike _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ does not display a strong inducible activity following uv irradiation . the detection of sa in the double _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant that is devoid of _LOCATION_ ics activity as suggested from the absence of _PROTEIN_ indicates that an alternative sa biosynthetic pathway is active . our data show that this pathway is not inducible by uv irradiation and accounts for minor amounts of total sa production .
