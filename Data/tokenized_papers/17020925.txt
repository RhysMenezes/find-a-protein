proteins containing the evolutionarily conserved _PROTEIN_ domain are involved in regulation of eukaryotic gene _PROTEIN_ and chromatin structure through their histone lysine methyltransferase activity . the drosophila su protein and related proteins of other _METHOD_ have been associated with gene repression and heterochromatinization . in arabidopsis there are suvh and suvr genes encoding proteins similar to su and suvh proteins have been shown to control heterochromatic silencing by its hmtase activity and by directing dna methylation . the suvr proteins differ from the suvh proteins in their domain structure and we show that the closely related _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins contain a novel domain at their n terminus and a suvr specific region preceding the _PROTEIN_ domain . green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusions of these suvr proteins preferably localize to the nucleolus suggesting involvement in regulation of rrna _PROTEIN_ in contrast to other _PROTEIN_ domain proteins studied so far . a novel hmtase specificity was demonstrated for _PROTEIN_ in that monomethylated histone is its preferred substrate in vitro .
the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes were originally identified using blast searches with _PROTEIN_ domain sequences from drosophila proteins against the arabidopsis genomic database . to investigate their _PROTEIN_ patterns more in detail rt pcr was performed using rna from young roots seedlings rosette leaves inflorescences and green full grown siliques . this analysis demonstrated highly similar _PROTEIN_ patterns for the three genes with _PROTEIN_ in all tissues examined strongest in inflorescences weakest in leaves and relatively weaker _PROTEIN_ in roots than in seedling . the ubiquitous _PROTEIN_ pattern suggests that these suvr genes are of importance during the whole life cycle of the plant . rt pcr cloning of long cdna sequences using primers designed for the and untranslated regions and additional available genbank sequences revealed that there for all three genes were transcripts with alternative splicing at the n terminus . the _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ two splice variants in flowers and buds with alternative start codons . the _PROTEIN_ transcript consisted of exons with the putative start codon in exon giving rise to an open reading frame of bp . the _PROTEIN_ transcript contained an alternative _PROTEIN_ donor site in the first intron resulting in a bp longer first exon . in addition the second intron which has a stop codon in the last triplet in frame with the rest of the orf was retained in this transcript . if the _PROTEIN_ transcript is to be translated into a _PROTEIN_ domain containing protein an alternative start codon in exon must be used giving an orf size of bp . this splice variant was found in five independent clones amplified from first strand cdna generated by reverse transcriptase primed with oligo dt . thus it was unlikely that these clones represented an incompletely processed transcript . we identified three _PROTEIN_ transcripts _PROTEIN_ contained exons with an orf of bp . a splice variant with an alternative _PROTEIN_ donor site reduced the length of exon by bp resulting in the _PROTEIN_ transcript with an orf of bp . a third transcript _PROTEIN_ revealed an alternative _PROTEIN_ acceptor site in the first intron which extended the second exon by bp and would add residues to the n terminus of the translation product compared to the other splice variants . for the _PROTEIN_ gene at least two different transcripts were _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ contained exons with an orf of bp . an alternative splice variant _PROTEIN_ had retained the bp second intron which can be translated in frame without disrupting the orf thereby resulting in an orf of bp . to identify the subcellular localization of the suvr proteins and the effect of ectopic suvr _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis plants were transformed with _PROTEIN_ inducible suvr _METHOD_ _METHOD_ fusion constructs . after induction with dexamethasone plants _PROTEIN_ the suvr _METHOD_ fusion proteins were inspected by _METHOD_ microscopy . no _METHOD_ was detected in any non induced plants and induced plants with high suvr _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ did not display any visible aberrant morphological phenotype . for each fusion construct the same subnuclear localization was seen in aboveground tissues and in roots . the localization was documented in roots as visualization of the _METHOD_ signal was better in cells without chlorophyll . plants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ splice variant showed a strong _METHOD_ signal in the nucleolus and a very weak signal in the nucleoplasm . in dapi stained _LOCATION_ the nucleolus appears as a black hole . fish performed with a probe against the rdna repeats was used as a control to confirm the specific localization to the nucleolus . this clearly demonstrated that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein associated with the nucleolus and did not overlap with the heterochromatic nucleolus organizing regions detected by the rdna probe . in plants transformed with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct strong _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was in contrast detected in the nucleoplasm and the protein was excluded from the nucleolus and the densely dapi stained heterochromatin . the differences in subnuclear localization between the two splice variants indicate that _PROTEIN_ distribution is regulated by alternative splicing . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ seen in subdomains associated with or within the nucleolus and a weaker signal was present in the nucleoplasm . additionally a variable number of _LOCATION_ bodies of unequal size were observed in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cells suggesting specific association with subnuclear regions . notably these _LOCATION_ bodies showed weaker dapi staining than the rest of the nucleoplasm and did not overlap with the dapi stained chromocenters . like _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ displayed a very specific localization with uniform _PROTEIN_ in the whole nucleolus in most of the _LOCATION_ investigated and much weaker _PROTEIN_ in the nucleoplasm . however in some nucleoli the _METHOD_ signal was not covering the whole nucleolus but seen as a smaller spot inside the nucleolus while for other _LOCATION_ the signal was an intermediate of the two preceding situations . in these _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ was observed in the whole nucleolus with a stronger signal in a spot at the edge of the nucleolus . putative nls were predicted to be present in both the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins by the predictnls server . the _PROTEIN_ protein has a potential nls with residues at the c terminus while the _PROTEIN_ sequence contains two putative nls a amino acid long motif in position and a short signal with residues in position . the _PROTEIN_ splice variant contains only . the difference in subnuclear localization between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ suggested that the longer n terminal fragment of _PROTEIN_ containing was responsible for the nucleolar targeting . interestingly with flanking residues has sequence identity to the predicted nls motif of the _PROTEIN_ protein which also has nucleolar localization . to test whether these nls motifs with associated residues were involved in targeting _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to the nucleolus _METHOD_ fusion constructs were made containing the first amino acids of _PROTEIN_ including both and the first amino acids of _PROTEIN_ including the last amino acids of _PROTEIN_ including the nls and _PROTEIN_ without the terminal nls . roots from arabidopsis plants transformed with these constructs were inspected for subcellular and subnuclear localization of the _METHOD_ signal . _METHOD_ was not found in the cytoplasm for any of the constructs . the amino acid fragment and also the amino acid fragment of _PROTEIN_ could direct _METHOD_ to the nucleolus confirming that the difference in subnuclear localization between the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins was due to sequences in the unique n terminus of the _PROTEIN_ splice variant . on the other hand is not involved in nucleolar targeting . the _PROTEIN_ amino acid peptide did also direct _METHOD_ to the nucleolus but the _METHOD_ signal was in addition seen in the nucleoplasm . in the nucleolus a stronger signal was usually present in a distinct spot as also seen in some _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein . the signal from _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ devoid of the terminal nls was also found localized in such spots however also in distinct spots in the nucleoplasm . thus this nls plays a role in the subnuclear localization of _PROTEIN_ although other parts of the suvr protein seem to be needed to accomplish a wild type subnuclear localization pattern . we have previously reported that the suvr subgroup contains no other domains than the _PROTEIN_ domain and the associated cysteine rich regions but the increased number of sequenced genomes and est sequences warranted a renewed search . we used an n terminal sequence of _PROTEIN_ extending to the first amino acid in the pre _PROTEIN_ domain in blastp tblastn and psi blast searches against nr and est databases of genbank . protein sequences or translated est sequences that showed significant sequence similarity to the _PROTEIN_ sequence were aligned . a conserved region _PROTEIN_ was identified and named the wiyld domain based on conserved residues . this domain which according to phdsec and jpred secondary structure prediction consists of three alpha helices was only found in plant sequences and so far only in proteins that possess a _PROTEIN_ domain or are without other known domains . the latter situation could however be due to the _PROTEIN_ that most of the sequences found to contain this domain were translations of partial cds . putative homologues of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and proteins were identified in rice tomato and wheat . the suvr proteins belong to the su subgroup of _PROTEIN_ domain proteins but alignment of these proteins to other proteins in this subgroup revealed a number of suvr specific characteristics . the _PROTEIN_ domains with their pre and post _PROTEIN_ domains and _PROTEIN_ i region _PROTEIN_ were highly conserved within the suvr group but differ from other _PROTEIN_ domain proteins at sites known to be of functional importance . the pre _PROTEIN_ domains are extended with a small insertion that contains three additional conserved cysteine residues _PROTEIN_ . the suvr group has the aa dan instead of the common aa pnl or pnv just c terminal to the catalytic core and a tryptophan in the motif elx _PROTEIN_ dy . the domain composition the suvr specific pre _PROTEIN_ domain and particularities of the suvr _PROTEIN_ domain substantiate that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are members of a particular subgroup of _PROTEIN_ domain proteins which _METHOD_ to be plant specific . since the _PROTEIN_ domains of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins show high sequence similarity with the _PROTEIN_ domains of known hmtases we tested whether these proteins had hmtase activity in vitro . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ c terminal fragments encompassing the pre _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and post _PROTEIN_ region did not methylate calf thymus histones . the full length _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein was however able to methylate calf thymus histone but no methylation was seen when using recombinant full length as substrate . the same results were seen for a amino acid c terminal fragment . these results indicated that posttranslational modification of was necessary for _PROTEIN_ activity . in an initial approach variously methylated histone peptides were tested as substrates . as expected the _PROTEIN_ protein showed very low hmtase activity against the unmethylated peptide again suggesting that unmethylated histone is a poor substrate . _PROTEIN_ was also unable to methylate peptides monomethylated at or dimethylated at . in contrast the peptide monomethylated at was significantly methylated by _PROTEIN_ . using antibodies against dimethylated on methylated peptide products from the hmtase assay it was evident that monomethylated histone became dimethylated at this position when incubated with active _PROTEIN_ protein . _PROTEIN_ was also able to methylate histone peptides of variable size when monomethylated at but not when monomethylated at or dimethylated on . the smallest peptide methylated residues mono methylated at contains only the lysine in position . together these data demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ specifically methylates histone position and has a substrate preference for monomethylated . this was supported by the lack of _PROTEIN_ hmtase activity when using a histone peptide monomethylated at as a substrate . as the fourth residue of the elx _PROTEIN_ dy motif has been shown to determine product specificity i.e . the number methyl groups added to the acceptor lysine the tryptophan of _PROTEIN_ was mutated into phenylalanine and tyrosine . _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins with these mutant versions of _PROTEIN_ were used in the hmtase assay against recombinant and methylated peptides . however none of these modified proteins showed any hmtase activity demonstrating that the tryptophan residue is absolutely necessary for the hmtase activity of _PROTEIN_ in vitro . some proteins require certain histone tail modifications to bind histones . to investigate whether posttranslational modifications were required for targeting and binding of _PROTEIN_ a pull down experiment was performed . in this in vitro binding assay the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ full length protein was able to bind recombinant histone which is devoid of posttranslational modifications . in addition we tested binding to calf thymus histones and by using antibodies against dimethylated histone we could show that _PROTEIN_ also bound histone with this modification although dimethylated is not a substrate for _PROTEIN_ . a amino acid c terminal _PROTEIN_ fragment lacking the wiyld domain pulled down calf thymus histone equally well as the full length _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein . in conclusion these pull down experiments demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ binds histone irrespective of the methylation status of lysine .
