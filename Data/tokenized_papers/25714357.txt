the phloem is a complex tissue composed of highly specialized cells with unique subcellular structures and a compact organization that is _PROTEIN_ to study in vivo at cellular resolution . we used confocal scanning laser microscopy and subcellular _METHOD_ markers in companion cells and sieve elements for live imaging of the phloem in arabidopsis leaves . this approach provided a simple framework for identifying phloem cell types unambiguously . it highlighted the compactness of the meshed network of organelles within companion cells . by contrast within the sieve elements unknown bodies were observed in association with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ markers at the cell periphery . the phloem lectin _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ marker was found in the parietal ground _PROTEIN_ . its location differed from that of the p protein filaments which were visualized with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ surrounded two types of bodies one of which was identified as mitochondria . this location suggested that it was embedded within the sieve element clamps specific structures that may fix the organelles to each another or to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in the sieve tubes . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was associated with a class of larger bodies potentially corresponding to _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was soluble in the _LOCATION_ of immature sieve elements . the changes in its subcellular localization during differentiation provide an in vivo blueprint for monitoring this process . the subcellular features obtained with these companion cell and sieve element markers can be used as landmarks for exploring the organization and dynamics of phloem cells in vivo .
we _PROTEIN_ the method described for vicia faba combining leaf peeling and light microscopy to view the vasculature of detached arabidopsis leaves . this method yielded a higher resolution than could be obtained with untreated leaves . as sugar export capacity may _PROTEIN_ rapidly in arabidopsis leaves following their excision from the plant we investigated the possible impairment of phloem transport after the cutting of the petiole and peeling off of the leaf surface with a razor blade . we used the phloem symplasmic tracer _PROTEIN_ diacetate to investigate both phloem transport and sieve element integrity . cfda is a _LOCATION_ permeant dye that is cleaved by cellular esterase to release _PROTEIN_ a non _LOCATION_ permeant _METHOD_ form of the dye . _METHOD_ rapidly progressed from the treated area into the veins with cf reaching the _PROTEIN_ vein at an apparent velocity of mm min moving in a proximal direction toward the petiole of the detached leaf . this value was in the same range as the velocity determined in intact arabidopsis plants indicating that the treatment did not prevent phloem transport from the treated area to the petiole and that leaf excision did not trigger the immediate sealing of the sieve tubes connected to the treated area . we also assessed the transport activity of the sieve tubes located immediately beneath the treated area . two areas located mm apart close to the midrib were peeled off with one used for tracer application and the other in a more proximal position used for observations of tracer translocation . after loading in the acropetal area the tracer moved basipetally across the second area on its way to the _PROTEIN_ vein at a flow velocity of up to mm min . the _METHOD_ continued to progress along the veins in this observation area with minimal _METHOD_ detectable outside the veins indicating that the sieve elements were continuing to translocate material beneath the treated area . thus the treatment of abaxial tissues from a detached arabidopsis leaf does not impede phloem transport function at least during the first few minutes after cutting . phloem imaging is therefore possible . leaves were observed by _METHOD_ microscopy under a _METHOD_ stereo microscope . the _METHOD_ appears as false color presentation using imagej fire lut . observation of _METHOD_ after the application of cfda to a treated area of the leaf . the veins in the loading area are already _METHOD_ labeled after s. after s the labeling extends to the _PROTEIN_ vein secondary vein and minor veins around the loading area . observation of the transport of the _METHOD_ label after the application of cfda to the treated area . observation of leaf _METHOD_ immediately after application of the tracer . treated areas are less

loaded in the loading area . seconds after the application of cfda . seconds after the application of cfda the _METHOD_ is transported and is visible in the transport area . seconds after the application of cfda the _METHOD_ has moved beyond the transport area . la loading area ta transport area mv minor vein sv secondary vein v _PROTEIN_ vein . scale bar mm . various transgenic arabidopsis col o lines producing green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ or other _METHOD_ proteins _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were generated for live imaging of the phloem . genes encoding free soluble _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ fused to the phloem lectin _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ under the control of a companion cell specific promoter . the _PROTEIN_ promoter was used in all constructs in preference to the _PROTEIN_ promoter which frequently drives cosuppression of the endogenous _PROTEIN_ gene . the veins were observed in vivo by confocal laser scanning microscopy _PROTEIN_ immediately after leaf peeling . _METHOD_ was bright in veins of the various orders _PROTEIN_ . longitudinal observations of the phloem cells were carried out . in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants _METHOD_ was observed in the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ of companion cells with no _METHOD_ in the sieve elements or phloem parenchyma cells _PROTEIN_ . this subcellular distribution was identical to that in undetached leaves as shown by in vivo observations of leaves in planta using stereo _METHOD_ microscope . similar findings were recorded for all veins with the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs . in an individual confocal section up to companion cells could be observed in the _PROTEIN_ veins whereas three to five companion cells were observed in the smallest minor veins . similar images were obtained with the _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ a phloem lectin closely related to _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants . by contrast free _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in both phloem parenchyma cells and companion cells in _METHOD_ plants . as the promoter sequence used was the same as that used for _PROTEIN_ fusions for which no signal was detected in phloem parenchyma cells these findings demonstrate the high specificity of this promoter for companion cells and they indicate that the soluble _METHOD_ was transported from the companion cell into the phloem parenchyma cells via the plasmodesmata . phloem parenchyma cells were larger and were found in _PROTEIN_ positions within the veins . by contrast _PROTEIN_ fusions which have an apparent molecular weight of and kda for the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fusions respectively did not diffuse from the companion cells to the phloem parenchyma cells unlike free _METHOD_ consistent with the plasmodesmata having a size exclusion limit for nonspecific trafficking of between and kda in arabidopsis leaves . visualization of soluble _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ tagged with _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ in leaves from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_

of soluble _METHOD_ produced under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter in a _METHOD_ plant . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ is observed in veins of all orders . localization of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in a _PROTEIN_ vein from a _METHOD_ plant . the soluble _METHOD_ is found in companion cells and phloem parenchyma cells . localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ to the junction of two veins from a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plant . bent companion cells are typically found at such junctions . localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in a vein from a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plant . _METHOD_ is found only in the companion cells . this observation was made on a cross between the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines so the _LOCATION_ is shown in yellow in the overlay due to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in a minor vein from a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plant . localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in a minor vein from a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plant . typical distribution of _LOCATION_ in the companion cells is observed . in the companion cells the _METHOD_ chloroplasts were aligned in a single file whereas in phloem parenchyma cells the chloroplasts were located at the cell periphery . cc companion cell ppc phloem parenchyma cell se sieve element . n _LOCATION_ . scale bar b . moreover no _METHOD_ was observed in the sieve elements with _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ fusions because of rapid translocation towards sink organs dilution in the _LOCATION_ of the sieve element or for _PROTEIN_ fusions an inability of the _METHOD_ proteins to pass through pore plasmodesmata units _PROTEIN_ . in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants in which the _METHOD_ signal was strictly limited to companion cells we analyzed in more detail the subcellular organization of companion cells . the elongated shape and dimensions of the companion cells labeled with the _METHOD_ protein were easily discerned except at the vein junctions where curved companion cells were characteristically enlarged at the bend . assessments of chlorophyll _METHOD_ showed a remarkable alignment of chloroplasts in single file in successive companion cells . up to chloroplasts could be observed in individual confocal sections . the chloroplasts occupied most of the diameter of the cells . this feature was sufficiently characteristic to constitute a hallmark of companion cells because no other cell type displayed such an alignment of chloroplasts . in most companion cells one chloroplast was found adjacent to one side of the cell _LOCATION_ . the mean diameter of the chloroplasts in companion cells was sd smaller than that in phloem parenchyma cells and mesophyll cells . other cell types also displayed markedly different chloroplast organizations . for example in phloem parenchyma cells the chloroplasts were arranged at the cell periphery mostly on the side opposite the companion cell . companion cells are highly compartmentalized . their subcellular organization was analyzed in crosses between the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line and transgenic lines producing _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ _METHOD_ marker molecules . these cells could be identified on the basis of chloroplast alignment or _METHOD_ _METHOD_ from the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion . an example of this approach is provided by the analysis of a cross with the _METHOD_ line which carries a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker . _METHOD_ was readily observed at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in companion cells . in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ histone _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ marker the _LOCATION_ of companion cells appeared dense and compacted . similarly large numbers of mitochondria could be seen in the cytoplasm of the companion cells along with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . there were also numerous _LOCATION_ with one _LOCATION_ often in contact with the _LOCATION_ in addition to chloroplasts . these results were obtained with plants _PROTEIN_ an _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ the cytochrome c oxidase iv mitochondrial marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the _LOCATION_ aquaporin _LOCATION_ marker _METHOD_ and the rubisco marker _METHOD_ respectively . we also observed the organization of the _LOCATION_ in plants _PROTEIN_ an actin filament marker _METHOD_ or a cortical microtubule marker _METHOD_ . the organization of the actin filaments was difficult to determine with _METHOD_ because the _METHOD_ signal was weaker than for other markers . a few _PROTEIN_ bundles of actin filaments were observed at the cell periphery mostly aligned along the long axis of the cell . individual fine actin filaments were difficult to visualize . as observed in _METHOD_ mbd plants the cortical microtubules were aligned in companion cells as in other cell types in a transverse or oblique orientation although heterogeneous arrays could be observed in some cells . _METHOD_ proteins observed in leaves from plants resulting from crosses between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants and lines carrying _METHOD_ proteins targeted to different subcellular compartments . overlay images obtained by _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ signals shown in false colors _METHOD_ is shown in green and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ in red except in . superimposed pixels are shown in yellow . observation of chloroplasts in the companion cells of a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ x rbcs _METHOD_ plant _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . observation of the typical morphology of phloem cells of a _METHOD_ plant . _METHOD_ is shown in green and chloroplast _METHOD_ is shown in red . two types of phloem cells and phloem parenchyma identified on the basis of _LOCATION_ distribution _METHOD_ . in these plants _METHOD_ _METHOD_ could also be used to identify sieve elements . phloem parenchyma cells are the largest cells and are located on the edge of the vasculature . sieve elements lack chloroplasts . companion cells display typical chloroplast alignments . observation of _LOCATION_ in the companion cells of a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ x _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plant . companion cells have square like _LOCATION_ . observation of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in the companion cells of a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ x _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ plant . in companion cells the _LOCATION_ is found principally next to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and around the _LOCATION_ . on this image the _LOCATION_ can also be seen in a sieve element aligned between two arrays of companion cells . observation of mitochondria in the companion cells of a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ x _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plant . on this image large numbers of mitochondria can be seen in the companion cells . observation of _LOCATION_ in the companion cells of a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ x ytip _METHOD_ plant . the image shows several _LOCATION_ per companion cell . observation of actin network in the companion cells of a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ x _METHOD_ plant . _PROTEIN_ actin bundles can be seen whereas thin actin filaments are barely detectable . observation of cortical microtubules in bent companion cells at a vein junction in a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ x _METHOD_ mbd plant . stars indicate the _LOCATION_ . scale bar . the subcellular organization of sieve elements was also examined . the _METHOD_ marker labeled the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in the sieve elements with brighter _METHOD_ was observed in the vicinity of the sieve plates . plants _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ marker _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ displayed a succession of fine _METHOD_ stacks at _PROTEIN_ positions in sieve elements . for the mitochondrial marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ we observed faint _METHOD_ colocalized with the vital dye mitotracker red indicating this marker is active in sieve elements . other _METHOD_ _METHOD_ markers were more difficult to visualize . for the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or the tonoplast marker _METHOD_ the breakdown of the _LOCATION_ and tonoplast during differentiation of the sieve elements accounted for the absence of _METHOD_ . for the actin marker _METHOD_ the microtubule marker _METHOD_ and the chloroplast marker _METHOD_ no _METHOD_ signal was detected in the sieve elements . sieve element _LOCATION_ are not photosynthetic and rubisco is probably degraded during sieve element differentiation . the actin _LOCATION_ has been identified in sieve elements and the lack of _METHOD_ may be due to the signal being below the detection threshold or the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusions being unable to pass through the _PROTEIN_ between the companion cells and sieve elements . _METHOD_ proteins observed in leaves from plants carrying _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in different subcellular compartments . images were obtained by _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ is shown in false color .

proteins in the sieve elements of a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plant . in and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ is shown in green _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ in red . in these images the p proteins form a typical plug next to the sieve plate and discrete filaments in the lumen of the sieve element and protein agglomerates . in _METHOD_ _METHOD_ is shown in yellow _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ in red and mitotracker _METHOD_ in blue . we also examined the subcellular organization of sieve tubes in transgenic arabidopsis lines producing _METHOD_ tagged sieve element proteins . as expected filaments of up to long and resembling those described in roots in planta were observed in the sieve elements of the leaves of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants producing a _METHOD_ labeled structural phloem filament protein _PROTEIN_ . similar findings were obtained for undetached leaves observed in planta using stereo _METHOD_ microscope . these filaments were not colocalized with mitochondria . in some cells the protein appeared to accumulate as spherical protein agglomerates similar to those reported in immature sieve elements in roots . similar images were obtained for plants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion . we then investigated the sieve tube proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . we analyzed the lines _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs in the tev susceptible _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and col o _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ background in which they provided functional complementation for tev restriction with _PROTEIN_ and for lmv restriction with . in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants an alignment of spherical protein bodies with an apparent diameter of was found at the periphery of individual sieve elements with up to bodies in the sieve elements found in the larger veins . these bodies were not colocalized with mitochondria . their dimensions were of a similar range to that of sieve element _LOCATION_ . by contrast in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants a reticulate organization lining the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and surrounding bodies smaller than mitochondria was observed in the sieve elements . the nature of these bodies remains unknown but structures of a similar dimension were observed in transmission electron micrographs of sieve elements in arabidopsis leaves . in the lines _PROTEIN_ these sieve element _METHOD_ markers as lines _PROTEIN_ companion _METHOD_ markers similar findings were obtained for all orders of veins other than for _PROTEIN_ which was difficult to image in the minor veins . _METHOD_ proteins observed in leaves from plants carrying _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in

observation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plant . observation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plant . scale bar . _PROTEIN_ phloem lectins were once considered to p protein components but their localization in the sieve elements remains a matter of debate . immunolocalization studies have shown that _PROTEIN_ accumulates in small bodies in the sieve elements . in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines in which _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ fusion is driven by the sieve element specific _PROTEIN_ promoter _METHOD_ was detected around bodies at the _PROTEIN_ cell borders of the sieve elements . these bodies had a bimodal size distribution with a _PROTEIN_ peak for their longest dimension at and a second less prominent peak at accounting for about one fifth of the bodies . they were motionless indicating they were anchored to _LOCATION_ . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signal could be mostly observed as small _PROTEIN_ surrounding an unlabeled area showing that the _METHOD_ tagged proteins accumulated principally at the periphery of some organelles . in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ leaves stained with mitotracker red the _METHOD_ was surrounded by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ demonstrating that the class of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labeled bodies with a small diameter corresponded to sieve element mitochondria . transmission electron micrographs of sieve elements confirmed that the mitochondria were aligned along the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ with an apparent diameter of . the larger bodies labeled by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not colocalize with mitotracker red . the _PROTEIN_ promoter is active in immature sieve elements making it possible to localize _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in differentiating sieve elements . in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants differentiating sieve elements were readily recognizable on the basis of their bright _METHOD_ signal . differentiation could be monitored by staining _LOCATION_ with propidium iodide and recording _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . at early stages of differentiation in cells that still contained a _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was found in the cytoplasm and in the _LOCATION_ as in companion cells . in differentiating cells displaying _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ but with no observable

_METHOD_ and _LOCATION_ staining _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was observed both in the _LOCATION_ and as small dots of _METHOD_ indicating the progressive anchoring of _PROTEIN_ to mitochondria or other
