the ectopically _PROTEIN_ cells _PROTEIN_ gene encodes a putative retaining glycosyltransferase of the _PROTEIN_ family and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants have a severely dwarfed phenotype . a new mutant allele of this gene _PROTEIN_ has been isolated . reduced cell adhesion that has previously been reported for the _PROTEIN_ mutant was not observed for either the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutants grown in our conditions suggesting that _PROTEIN_ does not affect cell adhesion but is involved in some other process affecting plant growth and development . it is shown that the _PROTEIN_ mutant exhibits hypersensitivity to the phytohormone abscisic acid in germination and root elongation assays however it shows an unaltered response to gibberellin epi brassinosteroid auxin or ethylene . an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein is localized to small motile structures within the _LOCATION_ that are similar in size and number to the _LOCATION_ apparatus . analysis of cell wall pectins revealed that levels of galactan in the _PROTEIN_ mutant are reduced by whilst other pectic polysaccharides are unchanged .
a dwarf mutant was isolated from a screen for stature mutants from the inra versailles arabidopsis t dna tagged population . southern analysis using a probe to the t dna showed a single band in a number of digests indicating the presence of a single t dna insertion . inverse pcr was used to clone the sequences flanking both left and right borders of the t dna . analysis of these sequences revealed that the t dna was inserted into the exon of the _PROTEIN_ gene . the _PROTEIN_ gene was identified by citation who described their analysis of the _PROTEIN_ mutant which is a syngenta sail line carrying a t dna insertion in the first intron of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ gene in ecotype columbia . like the sail line the _PROTEIN_ mutant is severely reduced in stature . leaf area and stem and root elongation are all greatly reduced and it has a slightly delayed flowering phenotype in both long and short photoperiods . in addition the _PROTEIN_ mutant also displays early senescence but it successfully completes a full life cycle and produces viable seed . the _PROTEIN_ mutation was shown to be recessive as the backcross population all exhibited a non dwarf phenotype whilst the population demonstrated a normal phenotypic segregation of non dwarf to dwarf a predicted ratio of approximately . all dwarf plants were found to be phosphinotricin _PROTEIN_ resistant which supports linkage of the dwarf phenotype to the t dna carrying the bar gene . a wild type genomic fragment containing the complete _PROTEIN_ coding region plus kb of upstream sequence was transformed into the _PROTEIN_ mutant . complete restoration of the wt phenotype in several transgenic lines confirmed that the mutant phenotype is caused by the t dna insertion into the _PROTEIN_ gene and not by any underlying second site mutations . two of these complemented lines _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were used in further studies . comparable levels of _PROTEIN_ were detected by northern analysis of leaves roots stem and flowers of wt plants but no significant _PROTEIN_ was detected in these tissues of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . in addition there was no evidence from the northern or from rt pcr analysis for the existence of a truncated message in the _PROTEIN_ mutant indicating that this is likely to be a null mutant . wt levels of _PROTEIN_ were detected in leaf tissue of each of the complemented lines . in addition to _PROTEIN_ two other genes encoding _PROTEIN_ proteins are present in arabidopsis . the function of these genes remains unclear at present although it is clear from the dwarfed phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutants that neither of the other two genes can functionally compensate for the inactivation of _PROTEIN_ . cell size is generally smaller in the _PROTEIN_ mutant compared with wild type plants . epidermal cell lengths in the mutant were less than half the length of those in wt or _PROTEIN_ plants . comparisons of wt and _PROTEIN_ d old seedlings highlighted a significant difference in the length of the primary root . on average the length of the primary roots of _PROTEIN_ seedlings was about one third of the length of seedlings of wt and complemented lines . in addition to having a short primary root the _PROTEIN_ mutant demonstrates an obvious phenotypic abnormality in the number length and distribution of the root hairs . consistent with the reduced shoot epidermal cell size root hairs of the _PROTEIN_ mutant are significantly shorter than wt and complemented mutant plants . defects in cell elongation and enlargement are known to cause similar root hair phenotypes in the root hair defective and rhd mutants both of which result in the production of short stubby hairs similar to those observed for the _PROTEIN_ mutant . mutations in enzymes that synthesize certain cell wall pectins result in reduced cell cell adhesion as is observed in the tobacco nolac and the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ mutants . reduced cell adhesion was reported by citation for d old _PROTEIN_ seedlings although cell adhesion was normal in younger _PROTEIN_ seedlings . detailed comparative analysis of hypocotyls from d old seedlings of both the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants was performed . sections of the hypocotyls from both mutants and their respective parental ecotypes ws and col were studied using light microscopy . the number of cells within each of the three cortical cell layers was determined and their size calculated using the javaimage program . the diameter of the hypocotyls was measured using a standard calibration slide . sections varied in size and cell number depending upon the position along the length of the hypocotyls . therefore to ensure that comparable sections were examined only sections having between cells in the outermost cortical cell layer were analysed . the analysis was repeated for a number of seedlings from each genotype so that four sections each from three blocks of embedded tissue were examined . the integrity of cellular adhesion varied between the sections of hypocotyls from the same genotype even for ws and col seedlings which may be due to the embedding and sectioning process . sections showing the greatest and least cell adhesion from each genotype are shown in fig . h. it was not evident from this analysis that the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutants had significantly reduced cell adhesion compared with wt control tissues . the diameter of the hypocotyl of the _PROTEIN_ mutant was also reported to be much larger than wt at d after germination . average hypocotyl diameters of seedlings of both mutants and their respective wt ecotypes indicated a slightly larger average diameter for both the _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ mutants although the difference was not significant . it remains unclear at present as to why the observations of citation of reduced cellular adhesion and fold increase in hypocotyl diameter for the _PROTEIN_ mutants can not be repeated . however as no significant differences in cell adhesion or hypocotyl diameter were observed it would appear that they are not linked to the _PROTEIN_ mutations or the dwarf phenotype of the mutants . our observations suggest that _PROTEIN_ is therefore unlikely to be involved in cell cell adhesion but in some other process that is critical for normal plant growth and development . since reduced stature such as that observed in the _PROTEIN_ mutant is often caused by reduced biosynthesis of or response to gibberellic acid the response of the _PROTEIN_ mutant to exogenous ga was tested . twice weekly application of ga could not rescue the dwarf phenotype of _PROTEIN_ indicating that ga biosynthesis was not affected in the mutant . in vitro assays were then used to investigate the response of the mutant to ga. endogenous ga biosynthesis was inhibited by paclobutrazol and exogenous ga was supplied at concentrations between and . hypocotyl elongation of the mutant was comparable with wt plants suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ mutant does not have an altered response to exogenous ga . however a fold higher level of exogenous ga was required by the _PROTEIN_ mutant to achieve comparable levels of germination to wt plants . this demonstrates that whilst _PROTEIN_ responds normally to ga higher levels of ga than normal are required for germination . as ga is known to act antagonistically to aba in seed germination the sensitivity of the _PROTEIN_ mutant to aba was investigated by measuring germination on media containing norflurazon with or without exogenous aba . figure shows that germination as measured by radicle emergence of the _PROTEIN_ mutant is more sensitive to aba than wt . this increased sensitivity is also seen in the effect of aba on root elongation where aba inhibits the elongation of _PROTEIN_ roots to a greater extent than that of wt roots . the increased sensitivity to aba of the _PROTEIN_ mutant could explain why higher levels of ga are required to stimulate seed germination to the same levels as wt seed . as the mutant exhibited an altered response to aba but not to ga it was examined whether it had altered sensitivity to other hormones or whether it was specifically affected in its response to aba . the response to auxin was tested by measuring the inhibition of root growth by increasing concentrations of both indole acetic acid and naphthaleneacetic acid . in each case no significant differences between _PROTEIN_ mutant and wt plants were detected . similarly a comparable response to ethylene was observed in _PROTEIN_ and wt plants _PROTEIN_ demonstrated a normal triple response when grown in the dark and there was no difference in the inhibition of root growth on aminocyclopropane _PROTEIN_ acid . furthermore the _PROTEIN_ mutant shows a normal hypocotyl elongation response to epi brassinolide application of which failed to rescue the mutant phenotype . thus the _PROTEIN_ mutant is not affected in its response to all hormones but shows a specific hypersensitivity to aba . the application of exogenous aba or auxin had no significant effect on the level of _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ . to investigate the subcellular localization of the protein _METHOD_ was fused to the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ under the control of the camv promoter . this construct was transformed into agrobacterium and infiltrated into tobacco leaves . after d the localization of the fusion protein was examined by laser scanning confocal microscopy of the leaf epidermal cells . the _METHOD_ was observed in small punctuate structures within the cytoplasm which were highly motile . the size and number of the structures were typical of what is observed for the _LOCATION_ apparatus . this supports recent proteomic observations that _PROTEIN_ co fractionated in subcellular fractionation experiments with known _LOCATION_ apparatus proteins and is consistent with the predicted structure of _PROTEIN_ as a type ii _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized glycosyltransferase . most glycosylation products of the _LOCATION_ apparatus are integrated into the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or secreted into the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . therefore the site of action of the _PROTEIN_ glycosylation product is likely to be at or outside the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . synthesis of cell wall components involves the action of many glycosyltransferases that are either located in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or in the _LOCATION_ apparatus . as _PROTEIN_ is a putative retaining glycosyltransferase and as the _METHOD_ localization is consistent with it being in the _LOCATION_ apparatus it is possible that the mutation may affect the synthesis of a cell wall polysaccharide . analysis of some of the pectic components of the cell wall namely hga arabinan _PROTEIN_ and galactan was carried out using _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of leaf material from _PROTEIN_ wt and _PROTEIN_ plants . in this technique oligosaccharides released from the cell wall by the action of a pure and specific hydrolase are derivatized by a fluorophore and the relative quantities of the different oligosaccharides are analysed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . as endo polygalacturonase can not hydrolyse highly esterified hga an alkaline pre treatment is necessary to give access to all the hga . the _PROTEIN_ revealed that the quantity of unesterified hga in _PROTEIN_ was unchanged relative to wt and furthermore that the same quantity of total hga was found after alkaline treatment . the quantity of galactan in _PROTEIN_ however was only about half of that present in wt cell walls . the reduced level of galactan observed in the _PROTEIN_ mutant fits with the reduced galactose levels observed in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the monoclonal antibody which recognizes tetramers of galactan was used in immunolocalization studies to investigate whether the distribution of galactan was altered in resin embedded sections of the _PROTEIN_ mutant but no differences were observed . in contrast to the reduced levels of galactan the quantity of arabinan in the _PROTEIN_ mutant was comparable with wt plants . complemented mutant plants exhibited wt levels of hga arabinan and galactan . to investigate whether there were any differences in levels or composition of rg ii in the mutant rg ii was extracted and purified as described by citation . rg i is the _PROTEIN_ polysaccharide and rg ii is a minor polysaccharide in both wt and mutant cell walls . rg ii was _PROTEIN_ present as the borate cross linked dimer form and the ratio between rg ii monomers and dimers was similar in both the wt and the mutant . the monosaccharide composition of the rg ii dimer was determined by gc of the trimethylsilyl methyl ester methyl glycoside derivatives and was also found to be similar between mutant and wt . as _PROTEIN_ have been implicated in the response of roots to aba and as inhibiting _PROTEIN_ function using _PROTEIN_ yariv reagent inhibits cell division and elongation resulting in a dwarf phenotype similar to the _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ levels and distribution were examined by immunolocalization . _METHOD_ of stem hypocotyls and root and leaf sections using two monoclonal antibodies and ccrc which recognize some _PROTEIN_ epitopes showed that these epitopes were present and their distribution was not altered in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . these results suggest that there is no substantial change in _PROTEIN_ distribution or abundance in the _PROTEIN_ mutant although it is difficult to rule out the possibility that there is a change in levels or structure of a particular _PROTEIN_ .
