stomatal apertures are regulated by morphological changes in guard cells which have been associated with guard cell _LOCATION_ structures . to investigate the contribution of guard cell _LOCATION_ to stomatal movement we examined the dynamics of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ structures in guard cells and evaluated the changes in _LOCATION_ volumes and surface areas during stomatal movement . using a transgenic arabidopsis line _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ we have found that the guard cell _LOCATION_ structures became complicated during stomatal closure with the appearance of numerous intra _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ structures . a three dimensional reconstruction using our originally developed software reant and photobleaching analysis revealed the continuity of the _LOCATION_ structures even when they appeared to be compartmented in confocal images of closed stomata . furthermore calculations of the surface area by reant revealed an increase in _LOCATION_ surface area during stomatal closure but a _PROTEIN_ in the surface area of the guard cells . movement of a vital staining dye to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was accelerated during aba induced stomatal closure in vicia faba . these results suggest that the guard cell _LOCATION_ store some portion of the excess _LOCATION_ materials produced during stomatal closure as intra _LOCATION_ structures .
to examine _LOCATION_ dynamics during stomatal movement we used a transgenic arabidopsis line stably _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ on the vm was confirmed by staining of the guard cells with . although is known as an endosomal marker pulse labeling for h and subsequent overnight chasing results in the final movement of this dye into the vm of living plant cells . using this transgenic line we investigated the dynamics of stomatal _LOCATION_ structures during stomatal movement . when the stomata were opened by white light illumination for h _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ observed on the outer vm in addition to the ridges of the transvacuolar strands . when we closed the stomata by application of aba many invaginated structures and some bulb like structures appeared in the _LOCATION_ lumen in addition to the outer vm . similar intra _LOCATION_ structures were seen in stomata closed by dark treatment for h but these structures largely disappeared when the stomata were opened after h of fusicoccin treatment . thus the vm structures were rather simple when the stomata were open but became complicated by intra _LOCATION_ structures when the stomata closed . to monitor _LOCATION_ dynamics during stomatal closure we categorized the _LOCATION_ structures of the guard cells as follows those with only some luminal structures were classified as type those with invaginated structures as type and those with clear bulb like structures as type . prior to aba application about of the cells had a type _LOCATION_ . after aba application this population started to _PROTEIN_ until by min almost no type _LOCATION_ could be observed . in contrast the population of type _LOCATION_ that was barely observable before aba application increased to about after min of aba application . the population of type _LOCATION_ first increased and then _PROTEIN_ implying that the type _LOCATION_ was the transient form of the type and _LOCATION_ . these observations suggested that the _LOCATION_ structures changed sequentially from a smooth and simple configuration to a more complicated form during stomatal closure . to confirm the sequential changes in _LOCATION_ structures during stomatal closure we defined the morphological parameter _LOCATION_ complexity . this parameter indicates the degree of excess _METHOD_ relative to the _LOCATION_ lumen and was calculated by where pv is the _LOCATION_ perimeter and av is its sectional area . the pv and av that are measured from the confocal images reflect the amount of _LOCATION_ and volume of _LOCATION_ respectively . the simplest structure a circle has the lowest value of cv and when the structure becomes complicated cv shows appropriately higher values . when we calculated the cv values of the guard cell _LOCATION_ the type _LOCATION_ often observed in open stomata showed a cv of whereas the type _LOCATION_ of closed stomata showed a value of and the type _LOCATION_ showed an intermediate cv of . to examine the spatial configurations of the complicated _LOCATION_ structures in guard cells we performed d reconstructions from a series of confocal images using our originally developed software package designated reant . with this software _METHOD_ images obtained by _PROTEIN_ are extracted as contours and the contours from successive z axis images are then stacked . subsequently the stacked contours are connected to form polygons and finally the d surface structures are generated . the d reconstruction of _LOCATION_ structures showed a large convoluted _LOCATION_ when the stomata were closed by aba or dark treatment . although these structures could have been expected from the confocal images the d images indicated that the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ a large structure and was not divided into compartments . in contrast when the stomata were opened after light or fc treatment large swollen and smooth _LOCATION_ with some transvacuolar strands were observed . to confirm _LOCATION_ continuity in the closed stomata photobleaching was performed in the guard cells stained with bcecf am a dye that stains the lumen of _LOCATION_ . after exposure of only a limited area to strong excitation light for min the bcecf _METHOD_ faded throughout the entire guard cell even though only a limited area was exposed whereas _METHOD_ in the adjacent guard cell was unaffected . the photobleaching analysis was also performed in v. faba since physiological studies of stomatal movement often use this material that has a relatively large guard cell size compared with arabidopsis . when stomata were opened by light illumination bcecf staining showed a large _LOCATION_ with a smooth surface occupying the guard cell whereas when the stomata were treated with aba many small circular regions that were not stained by bcecf were observed in the midplane . these regions appear to co localize with the _LOCATION_ . note that since the stoma shown in fig . does not seem still to be completely closed aba treatment may first _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ volume by releasing water and then modulate guard cell structure . after photobleaching the bcecf _METHOD_ faded in the entire region of the guard cell whereas _METHOD_ in the adjacent guard cell did not fade as in the arabidopsis guard cells . the advantage of reant in addition to allowing d reconstruction is its ability to calculate structural volume and its surface area through the surface model . to estimate the contribution of _LOCATION_ dynamics to guard cell movement the changes in volume and surface area of both the guard cell _LOCATION_ and the guard cell itself were calculated during stomatal closure . serial images of the _LOCATION_ and guard cells were obtained by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins and by visualizing the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ after staining with for min respectively . we previously used this dye to visualize the vm by h pulse labeling and subsequent overnight chasing but as this dye is first incorporated into the pm then into the endosomal _LOCATION_ and finally moves into the vm in living plant cells the pm could be visualized just after pulse labeling for min . when the stomata were opened after light incubation for h the arabidopsis guard cell and _LOCATION_ volumes were about and respectively with the _LOCATION_ occupying about of the guard cell volume . when epidermal peels were incubated in the dark for h and the stomata closed the pore widths _PROTEIN_ from about to and the volumes of the guard cells and their _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ to about and of the original values respectively . upon aba application the stomata closed within min and their pore widths remained constant thereafter . in this condition the volumes of both guard cells and their _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ but the _PROTEIN_ in guard cell _LOCATION_ appeared faster than that of the guard cells at the onset of stomatal closure . in min both values reached the levels attained under dark incubation although they continued to _PROTEIN_ even after stomatal closure . on the other hand the surface area of the guard cell _LOCATION_ increased by upon aba application whereas that of the guard cells _PROTEIN_ . notably the amount of increase in the _LOCATION_ surface area was comparable with the _PROTEIN_ of the guard cell pm . in contrast to dark incubation the changes in surface area upon aba application continued after stomatal closure as with the changes in volumes . to investigate the _LOCATION_ source that contributed to the increase in the surface area of the vm we chased the movement of in v. faba guard cells . after h of incubation in a buffer without aba the _METHOD_ was clearly detected near the pm whereas guard cells incubated with aba showed diffuse _METHOD_ in the cytoplasm . to monitor the activities of the endosomal pathway the _METHOD_ intensities of the pm vm and endosomes were measured . the acquired images were firstly processed to reduce noise using a gaussian filter and ridge patterns were extracted by a thinning filter . the _METHOD_ intensity of the pm was measured at the cell periphery along epidermal cells . the vm was recognized after the ridge extraction as long curves . the endosomes were recognized as small particles in the _LOCATION_ . to quantify the activities of the endosomal pathway the maximum values of the _METHOD_ intensity were measured . in control guard cells the ratio of those in the pm vm and endosomes was about and respectively . in the aba treated cells these values were and respectively in which the ratio of the maximum _METHOD_ intensity in the vm increased but that in the endosomes was comparable with that in control cells . since we measured the maximum _METHOD_ intensities in each component the comparable values in endosomes with or without aba implied that the amount of in endosomes was saturated after h incubation independently of aba application . when we plotted the maximum _METHOD_ intensities against stomatal aperture those in the pm _PROTEIN_ whereas those of the vm increased according to the stomatal closure .
the transgenic a. thaliana line _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ kindly provided by dr. m. h. sato was grown on soil vermiculite in a growth chamber at with humidity . the light and dark periods were and h respectively with white light . fully expanded rosette leaves of to week old plants after imbibition were used for experiments . vicia faba plants were grown under the same conditions as the arabidopsis plants and fully expanded leaves from near the apex of to week old plants were used . the abaxial epidermis of arabidopsis or v. faba was peeled off and floated inner surface facing down on a buffer consisting of mm kcl mm mes tris and . to monitor stomatal closure the epidermal strips were incubated under white light for h to open the stomata and to apply aba to the buffer . to close the stomata under dark conditions the epidermal strips were covered with aluminum foil for h and to open them chemically fusicoccin was applied to the buffer . after chemical treatment the stomata were observed under a light microscope and photographed with a ccd camera . stomatal apertures were determined by measuring the inner width of the stomatal pore from the photographs . to observe the vm of the guard cells by vital staining n { hexatrienyl } pyridium dibromide was applied to the buffer . after incubation for h the epidermal strips were washed with fresh buffer for h and then monitored as described previously . pm was monitored within min after pulse labeling the epidermal strips with for min and subsequent washing with fresh buffer . to quantify the activities of the endosomal pathway epidermal peels of v. faba were incubated in the buffer used for incorporating for min and washed with fresh buffer with or without aba for h. to observe the _LOCATION_ structures the epidermal strips were transferred into mm petri dishes with mm coverslip windows at the bottom . the dishes were placed onto the inverted platform of a _METHOD_ microscope equipped with a confocal laser scanning head and control _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or a cooled ccd camera head system . structural changes were categorized on the basis of images observed by light microscopy using a fitted camera . to quantify _METHOD_ in endosomal components they were monitored using _PROTEIN_ as described above . at image acquisition all settings including pin hole radius photomultiplier tube voltage and pixel width were fixed . acquired images were saved as bit tiff image files . the measurements of _METHOD_ at the pm endosomes and vm were performed using imagej . to reduce noise a gaussian filter was applied to the original images . the _METHOD_ intensities of the pm endosomes and vm were quantified from the pre processed images . the intensity of the pm was measured at the cell periphery along the epidermal cell . to calculate _LOCATION_ complexity confocal images of guard cell cross sections were taken at intervals around the midplane of the _LOCATION_ using the arabidopsis _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic line . parameters of _LOCATION_ sectional area and perimeter were obtained using imagej software and reant software . the complexity of _LOCATION_ was calculated from sectional areas and perimeters . to quantify _LOCATION_ shape regions of _LOCATION_ were segmented from confocal images of guard cell cross sections taken at intervals using the arabidopsis _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic line . segmentation of the _LOCATION_ region from the confocal image was performed manually and stored as a bi level image . d structures were reconstructed using reant . once the d data were reconstructed the rendering of the d images was performed using amira software version . the volumes and surface areas were calculated by reant from surface models . to stain the inside of _LOCATION_ bis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ acetoxymethyl ester was added to the buffer to a final concentration of and incubated with epidermal strips for h. the stained epidermal strips were monitored with a _METHOD_ microscope equipped with a ccd camera system . following observation and confirmation that bcecf _METHOD_ was limited to _LOCATION_ lumens photobleaching was performed by irradiating only a small area of the cell with a strong excitation light using an iris .
