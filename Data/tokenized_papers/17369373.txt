crosstalk between salicylic acid and jasmonic acid signaling is well studied but not during leaf senescence . we found that the senescence specific _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ interacts with the ja inducible protein epithiospecifying _PROTEIN_ regulator _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ of these genes is antagonistically regulated in response to ja and sa respectively and each negatively influences the other . leaf senescence is accelerated in _PROTEIN_ knockout plants _PROTEIN_ but retarded in _PROTEIN_ overexpressors _PROTEIN_ with the reverse true for _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ oe showed higher resistance than _PROTEIN_ ko to bacterial and fungal pathogens . however pathogen resistance was not altered in _PROTEIN_ overexpressors or knockouts suggesting that _PROTEIN_ has a greater impact on _PROTEIN_ function in senescence than _PROTEIN_ on _PROTEIN_ function in pathogen resistance . _PROTEIN_ inhibits _PROTEIN_ dna binding in vitro and their interaction is localized to the _LOCATION_ in vivo however _PROTEIN_ is exclusively in the cytoplasm in ko cells indicating that _PROTEIN_ is brought to the _LOCATION_ by the interaction . therefore _PROTEIN_ has dual functions as cytoplasmic epithiospecifier and as negative regulator of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mediate negative crosstalk between pathogen resistance and senescence which is most likely governed by the ja and sa equilibrium .
to find out whether _PROTEIN_ interacts with partner proteins to connect different signaling pathways the yeast two hybrid system was used . the _PROTEIN_ full length cdna was deleted for the activation domain and was fused to the c myc tag of the bait vector . this construct was transformed to the yeast strain . a cdna _PROTEIN_ library was prepared from leaves of week old plants exhibiting maximum _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ during plant development . the cdnas were introduced into the prey vector and transformed to the yeast strain . after mating colonies were selected and sequenced . the full length cdnas of selected candidate proteins were isolated and the interaction with _PROTEIN_ was tested in the yeast two hybrid system . for proteins the interaction with _PROTEIN_ could be confirmed for the full length c dna clones also including putative transcription _PROTEIN_ . one of the proteins was an epithiospecifying protein _PROTEIN_ and a putative jasmonate inducible protein containing amino acids and four kelch repeat domains . to characterize the function of this protein as a candidate for crosstalk between senescence and ja signaling in senescence we analyzed it in more detail . to specify its function more precisely we termed it _PROTEIN_ . first we confirmed the interaction in vitro by coimmunoprecipitation . anti glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ antibodies were able to pull down not only the recombinant _PROTEIN_ tagged version of _PROTEIN_ with the size of kd but also the recombinant his tagged version of _PROTEIN_ with the size of kd clearly indicating a protein protein interaction between _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ . since it was not predictable how much his tagged _PROTEIN_ can be precipitated by the interaction with _PROTEIN_ tagged _PROTEIN_ with the anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies two different concentrations of the bacterial extracts were loaded on the gel for the detection with both antibodies . moreover we tested the direct interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in vivo . therefore we used a technique designated as bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation . protoplasts prepared from leaves of _METHOD_ ha _PROTEIN_ transgenic arabidopsis plants were transiently transformed with plasmids encoding a _METHOD_ c myc _PROTEIN_ fusion protein . if the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins are able to interact directly in plant cells green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ should be reconstituted and should then be able to emit green _METHOD_ . whereas cells transformed with empty vectors produced no or only background _METHOD_ a strong signal was observed in the _LOCATION_ when _METHOD_ ha _PROTEIN_ was coexpressed with _METHOD_ cmyc _PROTEIN_ . these results indicated that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins are colocalized in the _LOCATION_ and interact on the protein level . if the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence was fused to full length _METHOD_ and transformed into protoplasts of wild type plants green _METHOD_ could be observed in the _LOCATION_ . if the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence was fused to _METHOD_ and transformed into protoplasts of wild type plants green _METHOD_ could be observed in the cytoplasm and in the _LOCATION_ . however if the same construct was transformed into protoplast prepared from _PROTEIN_ knockout plants green _METHOD_ was excluded from the _LOCATION_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ is brought into the _LOCATION_ via protein protein interaction with _PROTEIN_ . to show direct interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in plant tissue we also transformed the constructs into leaf epidermal cells of arabidopsis by agrobacterium tumefaciens infiltration . a strong _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in the _LOCATION_ of the epidermal cells when _METHOD_ c myc _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ ha _PROTEIN_ were coexpressed . _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ c myc _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ ha _PROTEIN_ alone induced no or only weak _METHOD_ signals . _PROTEIN_ of both fusion proteins could be demonstrated in the leaf tissue using ha and c myc specific antibodies . taken together it can be concluded that the _PROTEIN_ protein can directly interact with the _PROTEIN_ protein in vivo that the interaction takes place in the _LOCATION_ and that _PROTEIN_ is directed to the _LOCATION_ by the interaction with the _PROTEIN_ protein . to identify whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are targets of ja and sa signaling wild type plants ja insensitive mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and sa insensitive mutant _PROTEIN_ were treated with ja or mm sa and were analyzed for mrna levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the result of the rna gel blot analyses revealed that _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is reduced by sa and activated by ja conversely _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is activated by sa and is reduced by ja in wild type plants . for sa and ja treatment week old plants with a low _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ were chosen and for ja treatment week old plants with a high _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ were analyzed . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was not effected in _PROTEIN_ plants treated with sa and _PROTEIN_ plants treated with ja but repression was abolished in _PROTEIN_ treated with ja . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is not affected in _PROTEIN_ treated with sa but completely blocked in the _PROTEIN_ mutant and constitutively high in coil . these results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is a target of the _PROTEIN_ mediated and _PROTEIN_ mediated ja signaling pathways and is downstream of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . sa signaling on _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is not mediated by _PROTEIN_ . ja signaling on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is mediated by _PROTEIN_ but independent of _PROTEIN_ . in silico analyses of the _PROTEIN_ sequence revealed some similarities to the _PROTEIN_ family . _PROTEIN_ are rather small labile proteins that do not have any enzymatic activity per se . however they are considered to be a necessary myrosinase cofactor to drive the myrosinase catalyzed reaction toward the production of cyanoepithioalkanes starting from _PROTEIN_ containing a double terminal bond . the presence of eps during the hydrolysis of alkenyl _PROTEIN_ leads to the formation of epithionitriles instead of isothiocyanates by transfer of the sulfur atom from the basic _PROTEIN_ backbone to the terminal alkene residue of the side chain . these hydrolysis products have been found to be most active against herbivores and pathogens . citation could show that _PROTEIN_ belongs to the eps family . to test whether _PROTEIN_ has an influence on the _PROTEIN_ function as epithiospecifier to protect plants against bacterial and fungal pathogens _PROTEIN_ overexpressing _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion lines _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ overexpressing and _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion lines were analyzed for their pathogen responses . both lines were infected by the bacterial pathogen pseudomonas syringae dc and the fungal pathogen alternaria brassicicola respectively . in _PROTEIN_ oe plants the growth rate of bacteria in a defined leaf region _PROTEIN_ significantly compared with wild type plants whereas in _PROTEIN_ ko plants the growth rate of the bacteria increased . fungal infection was followed by visible damage of the infected leaves that can be categorized according to damage degrees . the infected leaves of the _PROTEIN_ oe line looked less damaged compared with wild type plants whereas the infected leaves of the _PROTEIN_ ko line were severely damaged . by contrast neither bacterial nor fungal infection revealed any significant difference among wild type plants oe and ko . gc _METHOD_ analyses of different isothiocyanates or nitriles revealed that by overexpressing _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis is driven toward the formation of nitrile compounds since much more of methylthio pentyl nitrile and indole acetonitrile can be detected in _PROTEIN_ oe . similar effects have already been shown by citation . by contrast much more isothiocyanates can be detected in _PROTEIN_ ko plants . this indicates that _PROTEIN_ can function as epithiospecifier and modifies the profile of the _PROTEIN_ derivatives that might be more effective against the tested pathogens . in accordance with the infection experiments only slight differences in these compounds can de observed in oe and ko plants . in this case overexpression led to a reduction of nitrile compounds in comparison to wild type plants whereas knockout of the gene led to a slight increase of nitriles . since _PROTEIN_ is most likely an important transcriptional regulator in leaf senescence we analyzed _PROTEIN_ oe and _PROTEIN_ ko plants for their senescence phenotype . comparing the corresponding leaves of week old plants among _PROTEIN_ oe _PROTEIN_ ko and wild type plants senescence was delayed in _PROTEIN_ oe leaves whereas in _PROTEIN_ ko senescence was strongly accelerated . by contrast oe showed accelerated and ko showed delayed senescence . this indicates an antagonistic function of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . a second _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion line showed the same phenotype however it was not as pronounced . therefore we complemented the mutant line exhibiting the strong phenotype with the _PROTEIN_ gene under the control of its own promoter to assure that the mutant phenotype was really due to the insertion of the t dna in the _PROTEIN_ gene . in these plants the phenotype of the wild type plants was completely restored . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ in the oe background also restored the wild type phenotype whereas overexpression of _PROTEIN_ in the ko plant had no additive effect and the same phenotype as for the ko plants could be observed . this is an indication that the _PROTEIN_ effect on leaf senescence is transmitted by _PROTEIN_ . to characterize the interplay between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ more precisely rna gel blot or rt pcr analyses were performed using transgenic lines with altered gene _PROTEIN_ of either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . modulation of _PROTEIN_ transcript levels by constitutive overexpression _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ level of the _PROTEIN_ gene compared with the wild type . several w boxes can be detected in the _PROTEIN_ promoter region and it was shown before that _PROTEIN_ can also act as transcriptional repressor . by contrast suppression of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the ko line led to an increase in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . moreover higher _PROTEIN_ transcript levels in _PROTEIN_ oe lines _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and suppression of _PROTEIN_ transcripts in _PROTEIN_ ko lines increased the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ can regulate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in a negative feedback loop and vice versa . transformation of increasing amounts of a _PROTEIN_ construct into _PROTEIN_ gus protoplasts confirmed that the _PROTEIN_ promoter driven _PROTEIN_ of a reporter gene was reduced in the presence of _PROTEIN_ . in vitro analyses by electrophoretic mobility shift assay _METHOD_ revealed that in the presence of increasing amounts of _PROTEIN_ protein the dna binding activity of _PROTEIN_ was inhibited . a time course of gene _PROTEIN_ after pathogen infection revealed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ reached the highest _PROTEIN_ rate already on the first day after inoculation with the pathogens whereas _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is slightly reduced . by contrast _PROTEIN_ showed higher _PROTEIN_ levels d after infection when _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is reduced again also indicating an antagonistic regulation of both genes . in the _PROTEIN_ oe plants which show higher pathogen resistance an elevated _PROTEIN_ of the defensin gene _PROTEIN_ can be detected whereas the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ appears to be almost unaffected
