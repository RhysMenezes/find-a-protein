an extensive analysis of the arabidopsis thaliana peripheral and integral _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteome was performed by sequential extractions with salt detergent and organic solvents followed by multidimensional protein separation steps different enzymatic and nonenzymatic protein cleavage techniques _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and bioinformatics . altogether proteins were identified of which were helical integral _LOCATION_ proteins . twenty seven new proteins without known function but with predicted chloroplast transit peptides were identified of which are integral _LOCATION_ proteins . these new proteins likely important in _LOCATION_ biogenesis include two rubredoxins a potential metallochaperone and a new dnaj like protein . the data were integrated with our analysis of the lumenal enriched proteome . we identified out of known proteins of the _LOCATION_ localized photosynthetic apparatus including several new paralogues and some proteins involved in protein insertion assembly folding or proteolysis . an additional proteins are involved in translation demonstrating that the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ surface is an important site for protein synthesis . the high coverage of the photosynthetic apparatus and the identification of known hydrophobic proteins with low _PROTEIN_ levels such as cpsece and _PROTEIN_ indicate an excellent dynamic resolution of the analysis . the sequential extraction process proved very helpful to validate transmembrane prediction . our data also were cross correlated to chloroplast subproteome analyses by other laboratories . all data are deposited in a new curated _LOCATION_ proteome database _PROTEIN_ with multiple search functions . this _PROTEIN_ will serve as an expandable resource for the plant community .
the peripheral and integral _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteomes were extracted into complementary protein populations and separated by or de gels or by rp hplc as depicted in figure . such extensive fractionation was undertaken to adjust methods of protein separation to hydrophobicity and to determine the localization and _LOCATION_ affinity for each protein . this will aid in the identification of proteins with low relative _PROTEIN_ levels provide information relevant to function and validate transmembrane prediction . in addition we used different strategies to improve the success rate of identification by _METHOD_ as discussed in greater detail in methods . three complementary subproteomes were generated including a peripheral enriched subproteome . isolated _LOCATION_ from a. thaliana leaves were subjected to yeda press treatment to remove most soluble lumenal proteins and associated stromal proteins similarly as in citation . the peripheral _LOCATION_ proteins then were extracted from these yeda press treated _LOCATION_ vesicles by m under repetitive sonication . this released remaining lumenal proteins as well as proteins that interact tightly with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ via electrostatic interactions . extracted proteins were separated on de denaturing gels with immobilized ph gradient strips in the first dimension followed by tricine _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the second dimension and were identified by _METHOD_ . a peripheral proteome interacting very tightly with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was generated . to further extract proteins that interact very tightly with the _LOCATION_ but that are typically not integral _LOCATION_ proteins the remaining salt extracted sonicated _LOCATION_ vesicles were incubated in triton x followed by two phase separation . this resulted in an upper detergent depleted phase and a lower detergent enriched phase . the upper phase containing the water soluble proteins was collected and the proteins were separated on de denaturing gels and identified by _METHOD_ . the lower phase was discarded . the integral _LOCATION_ proteome separated into five fractions also was generated . integral _LOCATION_ proteins were extracted from the treated _LOCATION_ . after dissolving these treated _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ the integral _LOCATION_ proteins were sequentially extracted first with acetone and then by chloroform/methanol mixtures of increasing _PROTEIN_ . this resulted in a total of five fractions . acetone also removed interfering chromophores . these five fractions of hydrophobic proteins were separated by rp hplc or by de tricine _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and proteins identified by _METHOD_ table lists all identified proteins in this study and also indicates in which fraction each protein was identified . as reported in table we cross checked these proteins to the data in our previous study on the yeda press extracted _LOCATION_ proteome enriched for the lumenal proteins as well as other studies describing a proteome analysis of the _LOCATION_ lumen and the chloroplast envelope . details for all of the identified proteins in this and our previous study on the lumen and cross references are summarized in table in the supplemental data online . this includes protein names functional domain prediction _PROTEIN_ locus number different physical chemical parameters _PROTEIN_ calculated for processed proteins curated and predicted number of _METHOD_ and localization prediction by a combination of targetp and lumenp with additional filters . these data also can be extracted from the _PROTEIN_ . overview of all identified proteins in this study the purity of the starting material _LOCATION_ was carefully considered . from our previous extensive _METHOD_ analysis we concluded that purified _LOCATION_ have little contamination from nonchloroplast components _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . nevertheless we further improved the purity of the isolated _LOCATION_ by reducing g values for collection of the _LOCATION_ and by slightly altering the percoll fractionation step . indeed very little mitochondrial contamination _LOCATION_ and a few other contaminations were found in the analysis in this study . our _PROTEIN_ concern in this analysis is contamination with envelope proteins because robust criteria are still lacking to distinguish between inner envelope and _LOCATION_ proteins based on amino acid sequence alone . to reduce potential envelope contamination the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were washed with a buffer free of to stimulate release of interacting envelopes . starting material _LOCATION_ was analyzed by protein gel blots to assess contamination from chloroplast envelopes . proteins from intact chloroplasts and yeda press treated _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and then transferred to blots and probed with a well known component of the chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ . a clear signal from was visible in the intact chloroplasts but not in the _LOCATION_ fraction . overexposure showed a very weak band for in the _LOCATION_ which was estimated to be < of the band in the intact chloroplasts . in the extensive _METHOD_ analysis in this article we did not find any of the well known components of the protein import apparatus nor the very abundant triose phosphate translocator of the inner _LOCATION_ or other known envelope transporters . therefore we concluded that the starting material for the _LOCATION_ proteome analysis contained very little contamination from the chloroplast envelopes . this was not surprising because _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ are much more abundant than envelopes and because _LOCATION_ sediment at much lower g values than envelopes . nevertheless all of our data were cross correlated with several published envelope proteome articles and we comment on the overlapping identities . finally we verified the presence of peripheral proteins in the treated _LOCATION_ by protein gel blots with a psii component associated with the lumenal side of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . intact chloroplasts yeda press treated _LOCATION_ stripped _LOCATION_ and the extracted peripheral proteins were probed . this showed that levels were below the detection limit in the treated _LOCATION_ . this was confirmed by the de gel of the triton x population because the levels were extremely low . figure shows a wide range pi gradient de gel of the extracted proteome as well as a region of a to pi gel with spot numbers . figures and show de gels of the and triton x proteomes with spot numbers corresponding to entries in table . experimental pi molecular weight and _METHOD_ data can be found in tables and in the supplemental data online and also can be extracted from the _PROTEIN_ . for more details see table in the supplemental data online . the _PROTEIN_ extracted proteome map was very much dominated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ together they represented > of the total protein _METHOD_ of this subproteome . other abundant proteins were and as well as the smaller members of the _PROTEIN_ complex . the triton x extracted subproteome represented only of the total peripheral proteome and was dominated by _PROTEIN_ and the family of fibrillins . in total different proteins were identified by a combination of _PROTEIN_ assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight _METHOD_ and electrospray ionization tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . twenty six proteins were unique for the maps and nine were unique for the triton maps whereas were found in both populations . comparison of the two maps clearly gives indications for _LOCATION_ affinity _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and were virtually completely removed by the treatment whereas _PROTEIN_ the fibrillins and _PROTEIN_ could not be completely extracted indicating very tight _LOCATION_ interactions . of these proteins were identified earlier in the lumenal enriched maps and also were found in another study concerning the lumenal proteome . new proteins without known function that are found in the population but not in the lumenal or triton fraction are _GENE_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ containing a pentapeptide repeat domain _GENE_ with a heavy metal binding domain and _GENE_ with one predicted tm domain but a low _PROTEIN_ value . interestingly _GENE_ also was found in an kd stromal complex and will be further evaluated in the discussion . _GENE_ was just recently reported to be a peripheral _LOCATION_ protein that can undergo light induced phosphorylation and also was found in the analysis of envelopes possibly as a contaminant . proteins that were unique for the triton x map and were not on the other de maps included a novel _PROTEIN_ like protein the _LOCATION_ specific ribosomal protein psrp earlier copurified with chloroplast ribosomes and the rieske fe s protein of the cytochrome complex . the latter cytochrome protein also was found as a contaminant in envelopes . in particular the region around the _PROTEIN_ cluster showed that the comigrating family of fibrillins could be much better resolved on the triton x map than it could on the map . the five organic solvent fractions with _LOCATION_ proteins each were separated on tricine _PROTEIN_ gels with m urea and visualized by staining with silver nitrate or _METHOD_ blue . surprisingly a set of low molecular weight proteins was extracted with acetone . the de gel lane between and kd of the acetone fraction was sliced into five bands and digested with trypsin and chymotrypsin or cleaved by limited acid hydrolysis or cnbr and analyzed by manual nano esi _METHOD_ . seven proteins belonging to psii psi or _PROTEIN_ synthase were identified including the recently characterized gene product as well as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . their common denominator is that they are small and hydrophobic with high _PROTEIN_ values and have one or two _METHOD_ . altogether gel pieces were systematically excised from the four de gel lanes of the c/m fractions in gel digested by trypsin and the peptides extracted . all of the samples then were analyzed by automated maldi tof _METHOD_ and on line lc esi _METHOD_ . we also analyzed the pooled upper and lower phase of the c/m fraction loaded together on a de tricine _PROTEIN_ gel selecting only visible protein gel bands for analysis . this extensive _METHOD_ analysis identified different proteins of which had one or more known or predicted helical _METHOD_ . thus of the identified proteins were integral _LOCATION_ proteins many of them without known function . these new proteins include two rubredoxins a potential metallochaperone and a new dnaj domain protein . one of these rubredoxins is a homolog of a rubredoxin in synechococcus sp pcc which was shown to be involved in the assembly of the interpolypeptide cluster fx of psi . we further review their identities and potential biological functions as well as their _LOCATION_ affinity in the discussion . finally rp hplc of the c/m fraction in combination with pepsin digestion was explored as an alternative to gel based separation and trypsin digestion . the rp hplc fractionation pattern was visualized by tricine _PROTEIN_ gels and showed that there was a distinct sharp fractionation pattern . the _METHOD_ were reproducible and a representative chromatogram is shown in figure . each fraction was dried down digested with pepsin and analyzed by esi _METHOD_ . twenty seven proteins were identified with one or more helical _METHOD_ and five proteins without predicted or known _METHOD_ . some of the proteins have no predicted ctp and it is not clear if they are truly _LOCATION_ proteins . the identities of these proteins are briefly evaluated in the discussion . in summary the acetone and c/m extraction of stripped _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and subsequent analysis resulted in the identification of different proteins of which had one or more tm . this set was very complementary to the de analysis resulting in a total of proteins . their functions and biological relevance also are evaluated in the discussion . an early analysis of the sequenced a. thaliana genome showed that only of the predicted proteins are unique in the genome . when proteins within such families are more than identical careful verification of the _METHOD_ results becomes important to determine if only one or more than one paralogues are identified . in some cases peptides are identified that match to more than one paralogue . uniquely matched peptides then are needed to determine which protein is _PROTEIN_ . in each table we have indicated if more than one paralogue matches the _METHOD_ results using an integer to link the paralogues . examples of such closely related paralogues that were identified in this study include ribosomal proteins and _PROTEIN_ psad psae psah and the members of the light harvesting complex of psii family . in nearly all cases we were able to determine which paralogue was identified using a unique or diagnostic peptide . this high success rate of paralogue identification was attributable to the very large number of peptides that were sequenced by _METHOD_ and the nature of the fractionation . in the case of the lhcii proteins we uniquely identified out of proteins . because the processed lhcii lhcii and lhcii are identical we could not distinguish them . we found many sequence tags for lhcii but they also matched to lhcii and lhcii . unique sequence tags were found for lhcii and lhcii . we analyzed several of the physical chemical properties of the proteins _PROTEIN_ identified in the different organic solvent fractions with the goal to understand their fractionation behavior and possibly extrapolate experimental parameters to better predict cellular localization and tm prediction . physical chemical properties were calculated for processed proteins based on cleavage site prediction by targetp lumenp and additional filtering . figure shows a cross correlation between calculated _PROTEIN_ values and number or tm per amino acid for all identified _LOCATION_ proteins . this illustrates that both parameters positively correlated and shows that the identified _LOCATION_ proteins range from a _PROTEIN_ value to and from tm per amino acids to tm per amino acids . figure compares the _PROTEIN_ index for the protein population identified in each of the organic solvent fractions identified by de gels using a frequency distribution plot . the acetone extracted proteome clearly separated according to _PROTEIN_ index . the proteins in the other organic solvent fractions show very similar _PROTEIN_ distributions . proteins identified in this study and our previous study concerning the _LOCATION_ lumen proteome were deposited into a newly developed database _PROTEIN_ . published data concerning the _LOCATION_ proteome available from other laboratories will be incorporated and used to curate prediction and experimental data . the experimental data are linked to the _PROTEIN_ annotation of the a. thaliana genome provided by the institute for genomic research as well as the mitochondrial and _LOCATION_ genomes . in addition to the deposited experimental information the database also provides the predicted localization based on a combination of different predictors and filters combined with a new lumenal proteome predictor and additional filters for selection of lumenal proteins derived from an experimental data set as well as by prediction of helical tm proteins using tm hmm version . together this provides predictions of four chloroplast sublocalizations stroma _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ lumen and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ with ltp . in the current release we predicted predicted _LOCATION_ encoded chloroplast proteins divided into stromal proteins lumenal proteins _PROTEIN_ tm proteins as well as proteins that have a predicted ltp and helical tm domains so called ambiguous _LOCATION_ proteins . predicted cleavage sites and biophysical properties including molecular weight _PROTEIN_ and pi are provided for each of the predicted proteins both for their precursor form as well as for their processed form in the case of _LOCATION_ proteins . it should be noted that despite filtering for a conserved cleavage in proteins without a _PROTEIN_ motif the lumenal proteome _METHOD_ somewhat overpredicted . a novel web interface is designed for accessing the _PROTEIN_ through the world wide web . through this interface the user can search for information by _PROTEIN_ accession number functional annotation and physical properties of all the genes in the _PROTEIN_ . details about protein fractionation can be extracted for those proteins that are identified experimentally by our lab . when searching for protein length molecular weight and pi the user can define a range and specify either mature or unprocessed proteins . the display of the search results can be customized by the user . links to tair are provided for each gene .

alkylated and proteins were run out on cm tricine _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gels . gels were fixed and proteins visualized by high sensitivity silver staining by _METHOD_ compatible silver staining by sypro ruby or by _METHOD_ brilliant blue r . gel images were taken either with the personal densitometer ii or with the fluors . spot annotation of de gels was performed with the ht analyzer program . _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins were extracted from the stripped _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ using organic solvents . _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were used as starting material . the pellet containing mostly integral _LOCATION_ proteins was washed several times in mm and mm hepes koh to remove residual . _LOCATION_ then were solubilized in laemmli buffer and heated at for min . the insolubilized material was removed by a spin for min . proteins in the supernatant were precipitated in nine volumes of cold acetone for min at and pelleted at for min . acetone in the supernatant then was evaporated and the remaining liquid was dialyzed for h and then concentrated . subsequently chlorophyll was removed by c/m extraction . the acetone soluble proteins in the methanol fraction then were dried down for _METHOD_ analysis . the acetone precipitated pellet was resuspended in laemmli solubilization buffer and used for sequential c/m extractions . these extractions were roughly based on citation with a few changes . each extraction with one specific c/m ratio was performed twice and the remaining pellet was resuspended in laemmli buffer homogenized and sonicated before the next extraction . c/m ratios of and were used . the residual c/m insoluble pellet was resuspended in laemmli buffer . the extracted protein fractions and the residual pellet were separated by de tricine _PROTEIN_ . in parallel to the gel based separation the c/m extracted proteins were separated by rp hplc on an analytical microbore column with trifluoroacetic acid in water and trifluoroacetic acid in isopropanol/acetonitrile . the c/m fraction was dried out resuspended in c/m spun at rpm for min and or supernatant was used for each hplc run . proteins were eluted using the following step gradient

maldi tof _METHOD_ in reflectron mode _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and were annotated automatically using the program m/z as part of knexus and http //www.genomicsolutions.com/ and internally calibrated using tryptic peptides from autodigestion . the _PROTEIN_ versions of the national center for biotechnology information blast nonredundant database or arabidopsis munich information center for protein sequences or tigr databases were searched automatically with the resulting peptide _METHOD_ lists using the search engine profound as part of knexus . for further investigation the peptides also were analyzed manually with nanoelectrospray needles or by nano lc esi _METHOD_ in automated mode on a quadruple/orthogonal acceleration tof tandem _METHOD_ spectrometer _METHOD_ . the spectra were used to search the public databases automated via sonar _METHOD_ as part of knexus or manually via mascot . criteria for positive identification by maldi tof _METHOD_ peptide _METHOD_ fingerprinting are five or more matching peptides with a narrow _LOCATION_ distribution _LOCATION_ within ppm and at least sequence coverage . in exceptional cases four matching peptides were considered as positive identification along with high sequence coverage . only peptides that have no missed cleavages and no modifications other than met oxidation and _PROTEIN_ were considered . criteria for positive identification by _METHOD_ were as follows if only one or two matching sequence tags were found nearly complete y ion series and partial complementary b ion series needed to be present in each with several diagnostic immonium ions present . peptide scores in mascot needed to be > and total protein scores > but we never relied on score alone . in the case of three or more matching peptides with peptide scores > manual inspection of y and b ion series was not required . most of the product ions matched within < d and precursor ions matched within d. when scoring with sonar _METHOD_ protein scores need to be smaller than and peptide scores needed to be well separated from the statistical noise _METHOD_ . again peptide matches were manually verified . for our internal database and in tables and in the supplemental data online all matches were translated in a confidence level or with level being the most confident . confidence level was chosen if the identification was close to the minimum matching requirements and level was chosen if it was well over these minimal requirements _METHOD_ . ambiguity number refers to matches to two or more closely related paralogues these
