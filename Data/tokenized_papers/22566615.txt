transcripts of plant organelle genes are modified by cytidine to uridine rna editing often changing the encoded amino acid predicted from the dna sequence . members of the _PROTEIN_ subclass of the pentatricopeptide repeat _PROTEIN_ motif containing family are site specific recognition _PROTEIN_ for either chloroplast or mitochondrial c targets of editing . however other than _PROTEIN_ proteins and the cis elements on the organelle transcripts no other components of the editing machinery in either organelle have previously been identified . the arabidopsis chloroplast _PROTEIN_ protein required for _PROTEIN_ rna editing _PROTEIN_ specifies editing of a c in the _PROTEIN_ transcript . _PROTEIN_ was detected in a complex of > kda . we immunoprecipitated epitope tagged _PROTEIN_ and tandem _METHOD_ analysis identified a protein of unknown function lacking _PROTEIN_ motifs we named it rna editing _PROTEIN_ interacting protein _PROTEIN_ . yeast two hybrid analysis confirmed _PROTEIN_ interaction with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions were found in both chloroplasts and mitochondria . editing assays for all known arabidopsis chloroplast targets in a _PROTEIN_ mutant revealed altered efficiency of editing events . in mitochondria editing events were found to have reduced efficiency with major loss of editing at c targets . virus induced gene silencing of _PROTEIN_ confirmed the altered editing efficiency . transient introduction of a wt _PROTEIN_ allele into _PROTEIN_ improved the defective rna editing . the presence of _PROTEIN_ in a protein complex along with chloroplast editing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ indicates that _PROTEIN_ is an important component of the rna editing apparatus that acts on many chloroplast and mitochondrial c targets .
our previous work reported the identification of _PROTEIN_ a _LOCATION_ editing _PROTEIN_ that controls the editing of _PROTEIN_ . we determined that _PROTEIN_ is present in a protein complex by performing size exclusion column chromatography on chloroplast stroma . to identify members of this complex we produced transgenic plants that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein carrying a _PROTEIN_ tag _PROTEIN_ . leaf protein extract from transgenic plants was incubated with _PROTEIN_ agarose to isolate the _PROTEIN_ complex . the _METHOD_ data indicated that the protein encoded by _GENE_ was the top candidate _PROTEIN_ interacting protein present in the immunoprepitate because it had the largest number of matches of _METHOD_ spectra other than _PROTEIN_ . the gene encodes a member of the differentiation and greening family mutants in members of this gene family exhibit chloroplast biogenesis defects . yeast two hybrid analysis confirmed the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and the protein encoded by _GENE_ which was therefore named _PROTEIN_ . serial deletions of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ established the portions responsible for the interaction on the n termini of the proteins . two mutant lines with insertions in the _PROTEIN_ locus were obtained from the inra _PROTEIN_ t dna collection . homozygous mutants could not be recovered from the _PROTEIN_ line possibly the t dna insertion in _PROTEIN_ might be lethal because of the complete loss of _PROTEIN_ . homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutants which have a t dna inserted bp upstream of the _PROTEIN_ coding region exhibit a dwarf phenotype . we measured the level of _PROTEIN_ transcript in the homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant line and homozygous wt siblings by quantitative rt pcr . the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ orf was found to be increased four to sixfold in the t dna mutant compared with the wt . nevertheless the proximity of the t dna insertion to the orf may result in impaired production of _PROTEIN_ protein abnormal phenotypes have previously been reported in t dna insertional mutants that exhibited increased rather than reduced target gene transcript abundance . because _PROTEIN_ coimmunoprecipitates and interacts in vivo with _PROTEIN_ a chloroplast editing _PROTEIN_ we surveyed the editing extent of all known arabidopsis chloroplast editing sites in segregating progeny for the _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion . a poisoned primer extension _PROTEIN_ assay is shown in fig ref for _PROTEIN_ and the three sites showing the most pronounced editing extent variation in the mutant relative to wt . petl and _PROTEIN_ exhibit a significant reduction of editing extent in the mutant whereas _PROTEIN_ a site in the first intron of _PROTEIN_ shows a significant increase of editing extent in the mutant . _PROTEIN_ data for _PROTEIN_ the site under the control of _PROTEIN_ indicate that editing in the homozygous mutant is reduced relative to wt as observed for petl and _PROTEIN_ but to a lesser extent . the mutation is clearly recessive because the editing extent of the heterozygous plant for these sites is similar to the homozygous wild plants . of the known chloroplast c targets of editing present in arabidopsis c targets exhibited significant changes in rna editing extent between the homozygous wt and the homozygous mutant plants of sites exhibit a _PROTEIN_ in editing extent in the mutant whereas an increase of editing extent in the mutant is observed for only sites . the editing extent of the heterozygote was not significantly different from the homozygous wt at any of the chloroplast sites . _PROTEIN_ has been previously reported to be located in mitochondria according to characterizations of the arabidopsis mitochondrial proteome . in addition the dwarf phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ t dna insertional mutant could be indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction . therefore we determined the location of _PROTEIN_ by transiently _PROTEIN_ a construct encoding the full length _PROTEIN_ attached to _METHOD_ under the control of a promoter into arabidopsis protoplasts . our observations indicate that _PROTEIN_ is dually targeted to chloroplasts and mitochondria . most of the arabidopsis protoplasts showed _PROTEIN_ to be localized in mitochondria . occasionally we observed _PROTEIN_ both in mitochondria and chloroplasts . this observation is reminiscent of a recent report on _PROTEIN_ a maize _PROTEIN_ dyw that is dually targeted to mitochondria and chloroplasts with a preference for mitochondria . to confirm the dual localization of _PROTEIN_ to both organelles we repeated the previous experiment by transfecting nicotiana benthamiana protoplasts . in contrast to arabidopsis protoplasts all of the transfected n. benthamiana protoplasts showed a dual localization of _PROTEIN_ to both mitochondria and chloroplasts . dapi staining of the n. benthamiana protoplasts showed that some of the small punctate structures targeted by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ colocalize with nucleoids . we conducted a bulk sequencing screen of the mitochondrial protein coding genes known to harbor editing sites by comparing the sequencing _METHOD_ of the rt pcr products obtained from the homozygous t dna mutant with the homozygous wt line . a typical result is shown in fig ref where the editing extent in the _PROTEIN_ transcript is not uniformly affected by the _PROTEIN_ mutation along the transcript . the majority of the _PROTEIN_ sites of sites do not show any reduction in editing extent in the mutant compared with the wt . however editing of _PROTEIN_ is not detectable in the mutant because only a c peak is observed at that position . between these two extremes are detected sites in which editing is reduced to less than one half of wt about one half of wt or more than one half of wt as observed in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . effect of _PROTEIN_ insertion on rna editing of mitochondrial c targets table summarizes the results of the bulk sequencing screen by presenting the number of sites for each mitochondrial gene that falls into one of five categories described for _PROTEIN_ transcript from no effect of the _PROTEIN_ mutation to an apparent absence of editing . of the mitochondrial genes surveyed only _PROTEIN_ which contains one reported editing site at position does not show any dependence on a functional _PROTEIN_ for efficient editing . overall mutation in _PROTEIN_ affects the editing extent of a very high number of mitochondrial sites of sites surveyed show a major loss of editing in the mutant . a very similar number of sites do not show any variation in editing extent in the mutant . a complete list of all of the affected mitochondrial c targets of editing among the sites assayed is shown in dataset . plant mitochondrial sites in the _PROTEIN_ mutant analyzed can be divided into two categories totally _PROTEIN_ dependent and totally _PROTEIN_ independent . although these categories are approximately equal in size in the entire population of genes analyzed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to play a larger role in editing of transcripts for proteins of certain mitochondrial complexes than others . for example transcripts of complex genes exhibit c targets affected by the _PROTEIN_ mutation and unaffected . in contrast the cytochrome c biogenesis complex exhibits c targets affected and only sites with editing extent that is unaffected . the effect of _PROTEIN_ mutation on mitochondrial extent does not seem to be related to the location of the c target on the transcript because there is no apparent pattern in the distribution of the _PROTEIN_ dependent and independent sites along the transcript . editing events can be divided into two classes nonsilent or silent . nonsilent sites are predominant in the population of sites surveyed . there are somewhat fewer nonsilent sites in the group of sites that are strongly affected in the _PROTEIN_ mutant than there are in the entire population of surveyed sites . we also examined a small selection of editing sites by the _PROTEIN_ assay which is more precise and sensitive than the rt pcr/bulk sequencing method that we used to survey the sites in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . we chose some mitochondrial editing sites that exhibited either no or complete dependence on functional _PROTEIN_ . although no editing of the c targets in cob and _PROTEIN_ was detected by the less sensitive bulk sequencing method we found that both exhibit a residual editing extent detectable by _PROTEIN_ . the negative effect of the _PROTEIN_ mutation on cob and _PROTEIN_ is greater than its effect on any chloroplast c targets . when the editing extent of these two sites was assayed by _PROTEIN_ in homozygotes heterozygotes and wt we found no difference between heterozygotes and wt indicating the mutation is completely recessive with respect to editing efficiency at these two c editing targets as well as other mitochondrial sites . we examined the level of a selection of mitochondrial transcripts in the mutant to investigate the possibility of a link between the steady state level of mitochondrial transcripts and the editing extent of their targeted c sites . among the mitochondrial transcripts assayed by quantitative rt pcr transcripts showed a significant increase in their abundance compared with the wt transcripts showed a moderate increase in the mutant and transcripts were in similar amounts in both the mutant and the wt . although ccmb the transcript harboring the highest number of sites with editing extents that are severely affected by _PROTEIN_ mutation shows the highest increase of transcript abundance in the mutant there is no obvious correlation between the steady state level of transcript and the incidence of _PROTEIN_ mutation on the editing extent . for example _PROTEIN_ which exhibits a similar increase of its transcript abundance in the mutant as ccmb does not harbor any site with editing extent that is greatly impaired in the mutant . conversely ccmfn with of targeted sites showing an apparent total loss of editing in _PROTEIN_ experiences only a slight increase of its transcript abundance in the mutant relative to the wt . eight of the sites on _PROTEIN_ transcript show a reduced editing extent in _PROTEIN_ whereas _PROTEIN_ abundance is similar to the wt . a model can be proposed in which a dosage effect is transcript specific and therefore a slight increase of ccmb transcript abundance is sufficient to have an effect on the editing extent of some of its sites . in this model some of the recognition transfactors directing the specific editing site of targeted c sites are in limiting amounts and therefore even a slight increase of the transcript abundance might deplete these recognition _PROTEIN_ resulting in an apparent reduction in editing efficiency . however this possibility is refuted by a close examination of the _PROTEIN_ ccmfn and _PROTEIN_ transcript abundances which show a very similar and slight increase in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . these three transcripts each possess a site _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ recognized by the same recognition _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in the _PROTEIN_ the editing extent of ccmfn is severely reduced whereas the editing extent of _PROTEIN_ is only slightly reduced _PROTEIN_ does not show any detectable difference in editing extent between _PROTEIN_ and the wt . in conclusion our mutant analysis data clearly indicate independence of the editing extent of the sites carried by a mitochondrial transcript and its abundance . unlike the mitochondrial transcripts the three _LOCATION_ transcripts assayed by quantitative rt pcr all show a reduction of steady state level in _PROTEIN_ compared with wt . similar to editing of mitochondrial transcripts there is no clear connection between the editing extent of _LOCATION_ sites and the amount of transcript that carries these sites . the _PROTEIN_ and petl sites show a _PROTEIN_ of editing extent in _PROTEIN_ whereas _PROTEIN_ editing extent is significantly increased in the mutant . we investigated organelle editing in two mutants that mimic the growth phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutant and are compromised in some aspects of organelle rna metabolism or organelle biogenesis . tissue was available from a mutant in the chloroplast polynucleotide phosphorylase which has a major role in maturing mrna and rrna ends but also participates in rna degradation through exonucleolytic digestion and polyadenylation . we obtained a second mutant that was affected in the gene encoding a chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ protein containing a putative _PROTEIN_ domain which has been reported recently to play an important role in a. thaliana chloroplast development . examination of the editing extent in two null mutants of the genes encoding these _LOCATION_ proteins shows no difference from the wt in the editing extent of _PROTEIN_ and cob two mitochondrial sites that show a drastic reduction of editing extent in _PROTEIN_ . among the five _LOCATION_ sites with editing extent that showed the largest variation in the _PROTEIN_ mutant we observed only an increase of editing extent in the null pnp and _PROTEIN_ mutants for certain sites . _PROTEIN_ with an editing extent in the _PROTEIN_ mutant that is about one half the amount observed in wt shows an increase of editing extent in both mutants _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and petl exhibit an increase of editing extent only in the pnp mutant whereas _PROTEIN_ editing extent is markedly increased only in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . _PROTEIN_ editing extent is invariant in both the pnp and _PROTEIN_ plants . because additional mutant lines with a second independent t dna insertion in _PROTEIN_ were not available we silenced _PROTEIN_ by virus induced gene silencing to confirm that the effect on rna editing was specifically attributable to a defective _PROTEIN_ gene . two types of control plants were used in this experiment uninoculated plants and plants inoculated with a silencing vector containing only _METHOD_ . quantitative rt pcr showed that the level of _PROTEIN_ transcript in _PROTEIN_ silenced plants was reduced to of the level detected in uninoculated plants . unexpectedly the level of _PROTEIN_ transcript in _METHOD_ silenced plants was increased to about two times the level in uninoculated plants . both _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ silenced plants show a significant reduction of _METHOD_ transcript compared with the uninoculated plants . _PROTEIN_ assays on transcripts from uninoculated and silenced plants showed that silencing of _PROTEIN_ results in an average _PROTEIN_ in petl editing extent and a increase in _PROTEIN_ editing extent compared with the uninoculated plants . a _PROTEIN_ in petl editing and an increase in _PROTEIN_ editing was likewise observed in the t dna mutant although as expected the effect of _PROTEIN_ knockdown in silenced plants is less than in the mutant . no significant difference in editing extent was detected between the _METHOD_ silenced and uninoculated plants . the editing extent for _PROTEIN_ in the uninoculated wt siblings was whereas the uninoculated _METHOD_ plants exhibited a editing efficiency . this discrepancy results from the _PROTEIN_ that the wt siblings of the mutant are in wassilewskija background whereas our arabidopsis _METHOD_ line used for vigs is in columbia background . _PROTEIN_ assay on mitochondrial transcripts from uninoculated and silenced plants also _METHOD_ the variation in mitochondrial editing extent observed in the t dna mutant . cob and _PROTEIN_ exhibit a very significant reduction of editing extent in _PROTEIN_ silenced plants compared with uninoculated control plants . as expected cob and _PROTEIN_ two c targets with editing efficiencies that are not affected in the _PROTEIN_ mutant do not show any _PROTEIN_ of editing extent in _PROTEIN_ silenced plants . not all c targets with editing that was greatly impaired in the _PROTEIN_ mutant exhibited detectable reduction in the silenced plants . for example no effect on _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ editing extent was detected in knockdown plants although they were strongly affected in the mutant . there may be sufficient _PROTEIN_ present in the silenced plants to allow editing of some sites to proceed normally . we used a transient transformation system in which an agrobacterium strain is vacuum infiltrated directly into young arabidopsis seedlings . _PROTEIN_ homozygous mutant seedlings were infiltrated with an agrobacterium strain carrying a binary vector containing a _PROTEIN_ construct . three days postinfiltration _PROTEIN_ analysis showed that editing extent in the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ and cob and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ sites was significantly increased in transfected vs. not transfected seedlings . this experiment provides additional evidence for the necessity of functional _PROTEIN_ for efficient mitochondrial and _LOCATION_ rna editing .
all genotyping was done by pcr with biomix red . for amplification of _PROTEIN_ in transgenic plants primer _PROTEIN_ and the strepiir primer were used . for genotyping of the _PROTEIN_ line the wt allele and t dna alleles were amplified with primer pairs _GENE_ with _GENE_ or _GENE_ with _PROTEIN_ respectively . likewise for the _PROTEIN_ line the primer pairs were _GENE_ with _GENE_ and _PROTEIN_ with _GENE_ . both lines were obtained from the inra _PROTEIN_ t dna collection . vigs of _GENE_ using a _METHOD_ cosilencing marker as in refs . citation and citation was performed with complete arabidopsis transcriptome microarray primers _GENE_ and _GENE_ . tissue was collected d postinoculation . all known arabidopsis chloroplast rna editing c targets were assayed as in ref . citation . mitochondrial rna editing sites were assayed by rt pcr bulk sequencing using primers described in refs . citation and citation . _PROTEIN_ analysis on mitochondrial sites cob cob _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was conducted as in ref . citation with primers cob _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ orf was transferred from the gateway entry clone _PROTEIN_ into the binary vector by recombination using lr clonase ii after sequence verification the plasmid was transformed into agrobacterium tumefaciens . sterile seeds from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ t dna heterozygous plant were germinated on _METHOD_ plates . after wk the homozygous mutant plants which were distinguishable from the other progeny because of their dwarf phenotype were collected onto new _METHOD_ plates and subjected to agrobacterium infiltration according to the protocol in ref . citation . dna and rna were collected d postinfiltration . dna genotyping confirmed the visual assignment of the mutant seedlings based on the dwarf phenotype . the _PROTEIN_ orf minus the stop codon was amplified from the clone with primers _GENE_ and _GENE_ and cloned into . after sequence verification the insert was transferred into the pearleygate vector by recombination using lr clonase ii creating an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion driven by the promoter . protoplasts from arabidopsis col accession or n. benthamiana were transfected with the plasmid using the protocol in ref . citation . protoplasts were checked for _METHOD_ under the confocal microscope h after incubation with the plasmid . protoplasts were incubated with mitotracker orange cm at a final concentration of nm for min centrifuged and resuspended in dye free medium . images were acquired using a leica confocal microscope . for chloroplast nucleoid staining n. benthamiana protoplasts were incubated with dapi for min before visualization using a zeiss confocal microscope . quantitative rt pcr was performed as described in ref . citation . all of the primers used for quantitative rt pcr are given in si appendix table . the results of the quantitative rt pcr analysis were normalized using the gene _GENE_ which has been shown to be a superior reference gene for transcript normalization in arabidopsis .
