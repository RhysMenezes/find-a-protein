plant organelle function must constantly adjust to environmental conditions which requires dynamic coordination . signaling may play a central role in this process . free dynamics are tightly regulated and differ markedly between the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ stroma and mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ . the mechanistic basis of compartment specific dynamics is poorly understood . here we studied the function of at micu an ef hand protein of arabidopsis thaliana with homology to constituents of the mitochondrial uniporter machinery in mammals . micu binds and localizes to the mitochondria in arabidopsis . in vivo imaging of roots _PROTEIN_ a genetically encoded sensor in the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ revealed that lack of micu increased resting concentrations of free in the _PROTEIN_ . furthermore elevations triggered by auxin and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ occurred more rapidly and reached higher maximal concentrations in the mitochondria of micu mutants whereas _LOCATION_ signatures remained unchanged . these findings support the idea that a conserved uniporter system with composition and regulation distinct from the mammalian machinery mediates mitochondrial uptake in plants under in vivo conditions . they further suggest that micu acts as a throttle that controls uptake by moderating influx thereby shaping signatures in the _PROTEIN_ and preserving mitochondrial homeostasis . our results open the door to genetic dissection of mitochondrial signaling in plants .
the discovery of in mammals was achieved by a phylogenetic approach making use of the conservation of mitochondrial uniport in most eukaryotes . we performed a refined phylogenetic analysis for plants confirming that micu is conserved throughout the plant kingdom which suggests an important functional role in plants . most plant species included in the analysis contained at least two micu homologs . only one homolog was found in a small number of specific clades across the phylogeny including the chlorophytes and the brassicacea . this indicates that although diversification can occur one micu locus is sufficient and arabidopsis represents this minimal configuration . furthermore homologs of the _METHOD_ and that are present in vertebrates could not be found in arabidopsis . the amino acid sequence of arabidopsis micu _PROTEIN_ showed similarity and identity to its homolog in human . the two binding ef hand motifs present in mammalian are conserved while there is an additional third ef hand predicted in arabidopsis . all three ef hand motifs feature all characteristics required for functionality including the critical charged residues for binding . a second predicted splicing variant at lacks the c terminal ef hand . we sought to exploit this genetic situation as a tangible model to dissect the physiological role of micu in plants . to assess if at micu is indeed able to bind as predicted by the presence of the ef hand motifs we performed overlay assays and measured the effect of free concentrations on protein folding stability by ligand induced thermal stabilization assays . for that we used a recombinantly _PROTEIN_ and purified truncated version of at . lacks the first amino acids thereby eliminating the signal peptide and putative transmembrane/disordered sequences and carries an n terminal his tag . all predicted ef hand motifs remain intact . using overlay after gel based protein separation strong signals were present at the predicted molecular weights of and aequorin but not bsa . based on the hypothesis that binding alters the structural stability of we further investigated the affinity range of binding by differential scanning fluorimetry in the presence of increasing free concentrations and physiological buffer ph and observed thermal stabilization with increasing free concentrations . two sigmoid transitions indicating stabilization by binding could be clearly distinguished . the first occurred between nm and and the second between and free . since it is plausible that more than one binding site contributes to one transition this points to the presence of at least two binding sites with apparent binding affinities around and respectively . the control showed poor stabilization only starting above around suggesting that binding is selective . the first induced transition coincides with the physiological concentration range of intracellular free and is lower than the binding constants estimated for mammalian . while the binding affinities measured must be considered qualitative estimates they clearly indicate that can bind in vitro at physiological concentrations with impact on the structural properties of the protein . public transcriptomic data indicate that micu is ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ across arabidopsis tissues . _PROTEIN_ in root shoot floral bud and pollen is also supported by two shotgun proteomic screens of whole tissue extracts _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . experimental evidence on the subcellular localization of micu has been lacking however . bioinformatics _METHOD_ provide ambiguous targeting predictions with an overall priority for mitochondria or _LOCATION_ . rt pcr analysis of the full length transcript in whole plant extracts of the accessions col and col suggested transcript levels similar to the control . a predicted splicing variant could be detected at much lower levels . this was refined by quantitative rt pcr for roots and rosettes separately showing _PROTEIN_ of comparable magnitude in both green and non green tissue . the second splicing variant was present at > times lower abundance compared with the _PROTEIN_ transcript . we detected micu in the proteome of our mitochondrial preparations from arabidopsis as one out of identified arabidopsis proteins at a protein and peptide false discovery rate of . of the protein preparation was annotated as mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ suggesting reasonable mitochondrial purity . identified proteins covered five orders of magnitude in abundance as estimated by the ibaq value which is based on peptide ion intensity . micu was detected with only one unique peptide with an andromeda score of a posterior probability of and abundance ranked at with a relative protein abundance of among all identified proteins . the low abundance of micu identified in the proteomic experiment may explain the absence of micu from previous plant mitochondrial proteome studies and strengthened the hypothesis of micu as a mitochondrial protein . additional support comes from the presence of a homolog of mcu _PROTEIN_ in our data set the pore forming component of the mitochondrial uniporter in mammals . this is consistent with the recent detection of an mcu homolog in an extension of the study of the potato tuber mitochondrial proteome . for independent validation we raised a polyclonal antibody against protein which we applied to probe for micu directly . however the purified antibody did not label a clear band at the expected size for in whole cell extracts or isolated mitochondria from col wild type plants although a overexpressed _METHOD_ fusion protein appeared as a band of the predicted size at kd in protein extracts from isolated mitochondria . this suggests specific micu recognition by the antibody but with insufficient affinity for detection of endogenous micu even in enriched preparations under the conditions used . as an orthogonal approach we analyzed n and c terminal _METHOD_ fusions of the full length coding sequence of under the control of a promoter by confocal microscopy . transient _PROTEIN_ of the c terminal fusion construct _METHOD_ in wild tobacco leaf epidermis showed _METHOD_ _METHOD_ that colocalized with the mitochondrial marker mitotracker orange indicating mitochondrial localization . by contrast the n terminal fusion construct _METHOD_ displayed _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ localization suggesting that the n terminus which is blocked by the n terminal _METHOD_ fusion is critical for mitochondrial targeting . to rule out potential localization artifacts we generated stable arabidopsis transformants using the c terminal _METHOD_ fusion construct . three independent lines were assessed in leaf epidermis hypocotyl and rhizodermis . _METHOD_ signal was consistently observed in small round to elongated highly dynamic subcellular structures and colocalized with mitotracker orange and/or tetramethyl rhodamine methyl ester confirming the transient _PROTEIN_ data in wild tobacco . minor signal in the _METHOD_ channel that was occasionally observed in chloroplast regions of leaf samples was equally observed in controls suggesting minor spectroscopic bleed through of chlorophyll _METHOD_ . when imaging larger mitochondria of the stable _METHOD_ lines it was possible to resolve _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ like structures . the _METHOD_ signal did not strictly colocalize with the mitotracker signal but instead appeared consistently broader . since resolution of subcompartments in individual mitochondria is close to the resolution limit of classical light microscopy we determined and merged the pixel intensity distributions of multiple mitochondria to improve signal to noise statistics . the highest _METHOD_ intensity pixels surrounded the mitotracker signal maximum suggesting that micu was localized in a different mitochondrial subcompartment to mitotracker . using _METHOD_ targeted to the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ as a control showed an intensity distribution that resembled that of mitotracker ruling out chromatic aberration effects while the outer mitochondrial _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ showed two pronounced intensity maxima with the mitotracker maximum in between . both intensity distributions differed from that of _METHOD_ indicating that the protein localizes to a mitochondrial subcompartment other than the _PROTEIN_ and the outer mitochondrial _LOCATION_ . this points to presence of at micu at/in the inner mitochondrial _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and/or in the intermembrane space _METHOD_ which is in agreement with a majority of micu localization studies in mammalian _METHOD_ . based on the ef hand motifs the ability to bind the homology to mammalian micu proteins and the mitochondrial localization we hypothesized that at micu is involved in mitochondrial dynamics in planta and chose a reverse genetic approach to test this hypothesis . two independent arabidopsis lines with t dna insertions in either the sixth or the first exon of the micu locus were chosen and the precise positions of the respective insertion sites were determined by sequencing . the t dna cassette was integrated or bp downstream of the micu start codon in micu or micu respectively . homozygous lines were selected and validated using pcr based genotyping . transcript analysis by quantitative as well as standard rt pcr showed a complete loss of micu transcript in both insertion lines compared with their corresponding wild type controls . this provided the basis for a genetic dissection of micu function in vivo . to obtain a specific measure of free concentration in the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ in planta we used the genetically encoded sensor yellow cameleon which was recently _PROTEIN_ for dynamic measurement of dynamics in the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ of arabidopsis . reversible binding by the sensor induces a conformational change that can be detected by a change in the resonance energy transfer efficiency between the two fluorophores that are part of the probe _METHOD_ such that the fret ratio _METHOD_ increases with increasing free concentration thereby providing a quantitative readout . the sensor construct for mitochondrial targeting was transformed into homozygous micu and micu and at least five positive independent individuals were selected by sensor _METHOD_ for each . suitable _METHOD_ intensity _PROTEIN_ as well as correct mitochondrial localization of the sensor by colocalization with mitotracker orange were confirmed by confocal laser scanning microscopy . for all measurements homozygous or seedlings of at least two independent lines were used for both micu and micu . this provided a robust system to assess the impact that lack of micu has on mitochondrial dynamics in vivo . for in vivo imaging of free we focused on roots where we have experimentally demonstrated micu _PROTEIN_ . root tissue offers favorable properties for in vivo imaging including strong sensor signal the opportunity to record data in a submerged state that is not dissimilar from the physiological state on culture plates no risk of interference from chlorophyll _METHOD_ and established treatment procedures to induce mitochondrial transients . we analyzed the confocal data sets in a ratiometric manner generating pseudo color images to represent the fret ratios across the root tip . this indicated that ratio values for the micu lines were increased compared with the control suggesting an elevated free concentration in the _PROTEIN_ . the increase was similar in both micu lines and very consistent between experiments . nevertheless the ratio images suggested substantial steady state heterogeneity in _PROTEIN_ calcium between the different tissue types in the root tip . values in the root cap were consistently lower than those around the meristematic zone with a _PROTEIN_ toward the elongation zone . to account for this baseline heterogeneity and to assess quantitatively where the apparent fret ratio changes were most pronounced in the micu lines we systematically subdivided the ratio images into equal sections starting from the tip . while the sections in the cap area and the start of the elongation zone only showed minor differences between the lines they were most pronounced and highly significant in the upper meristematic zone . to minimize the impact of tissue heterogeneity we focused on a region of interest in this area for the subsequent assessment of dynamics . semiquantitative assessment of intact root tips with the cationic lipophilic red _METHOD_ probe tmrm did not show any significant differences between the lines in the roi . tmrm reversibly accumulates in the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ in response to the electrical potential across the inner _LOCATION_ . due to the nernstian response characteristics of tmrm even small changes in lead to pronounced changes in probe _METHOD_ suggesting that changes in were unlikely to account for the observed elevation in free _PROTEIN_ . increased fret ratios of the cameleon sensor suggest that _PROTEIN_ activity is constitutively elevated in root tissues of the micu lines and that micu plays a role in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels at low concentrations in vivo . to investigate if micu is also involved in active dynamics we next analyzed _PROTEIN_ transients in roots . since the stimulation of well defined and strictly reproducible transients in complex plant tissue is technically _PROTEIN_ we employed a custom perfusion setup for in vivo _METHOD_ microscopy of arabidopsis roots . we applied auxin in the form of naphthaleneacetic acid for which we have observed reliable induction of mitochondrial transients . remarkable reproducibility of the observed response allowed quantitative analysis of bona fide in vivo dynamics . the analysis is based on fret ratios for maximal rigor and avoidance of additional assumptions related to the transformation to absolute free concentrations . nevertheless meaningful estimation of free concentrations is possible . the baseline ratio was stable in all lines but significantly elevated in the micu lines confirming the steady state measurements by confocal imaging . naa application caused an instantaneous increase in fret ratios in all lines reaching a relatively stable plateau for s followed by recovery to baseline . the pronounced steady state shift between col and both micu lines remained significant throughout the entire transient . this suggests that the maximal free concentrations reached in the _PROTEIN_ during the transient are much higher in the micu background and that the baseline concentrations in the micu lines are comparable to those reached in the wild type upon excitation by the auxin stimulus . although the transients of the micu lines appeared slightly different from one another with micu reaching a higher plateau than micu this was not significant at any time point . the shape of the transients was also consistently altered in both micu lines relative to the wild type . the initial linear rate of fret ratio increase was nearly doubled suggesting more rapid accumulation in the _PROTEIN_ . the plateau was reached earlier demonstrated by shortened times to pass the half maximal ratio and a higher peak fret ratio was reached representing higher maximal concentrations . in contrast the time to pass the half maximal ratio on the recovery was not significantly altered indicating unchanged kinetics of _PROTEIN_ clearance after the naa stimulus . to test if the observed changes in organellar kinetics were specific to naa or can be generalized we selected _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ as an independent and well established stimulus . importantly our measurements in the control demonstrated that eatp triggers mitochondrial transients with a different signature to that of naa . the resting ratios were very similar to those measured prior to the naa time courses confirming elevated ratios in the micu lines . eatp gave rise to a transient increase in free in all lines with a clear _PROTEIN_ maximum higher than that of naa before declining again . similar to naa the shift between col and both micu lines remained significant throughout the entire transient and the shape of the transients was distinct . the initial linear rate which was times faster for eatp than for naa in col was increased even further in the micu lines . consistently the maximum was also reached sooner and higher peak fret ratios were reached . in addition the recovery was quicker in the micu lines suggesting increased clearance rates after the eatp induced transient in contrast with observations for naa . the consistent behavior of the micu lines upon treatment with either auxin or eatp suggests that the _METHOD_ responsible for the different mitochondrial transients measured between micu lines and col are independent of stimulus identity . the only exception is the recovery rate that was unchanged in response to naa but increased in the mutants in response to eatp . it is possible that the high absolute _PROTEIN_ concentration in the micu lines in response to eatp may have additional and potentially independent regulatory impact . given the pronounced changes in _PROTEIN_ dynamics we aimed to explore how those alterations are connected to subcellular dynamics in other compartments . to investigate _LOCATION_ transients in the mutant micu lines we _PROTEIN_ the cameleon sensor in the _LOCATION_ in an analogous manner to the generation of the mitochondrial sensor lines thereby enabling assessment of _LOCATION_ dynamics under identical conditions to those used for mitochondrial measurements . under steady state conditions fret ratios were consistently lower in the _LOCATION_ compared with the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ indicating lower free concentrations . interestingly the micu mutants did not differ significantly from the control . similar behavior for control and micu lines was also found for _LOCATION_ dynamics in response to both naa and eatp and there was no significant difference in fret ratios found at any time point . naa induced a much milder transient in the _LOCATION_ than in the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ that was also distinct in shape containing at least two components . eatp triggered a _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ that was shorter lived and lower in amplitude compared with the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ . the micu lines showed no alteration in any of the kinetic parameters that were changed in the _PROTEIN_ . to make sure that the cameleon sensor was technically functional in the _LOCATION_ and responses were comparable with those in the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ we triggered a more pronounced transient as a positive control . we used a fold higher concentration of eatp as a stimulus which in agreement with previous observations of dose dependence resulted in a pronounced increase in amplitude adding additional weight to the validity of the quantitative sensing setup . those observations suggest that while micu shapes dynamics in the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ the impact appears to be mitochondria specific and does not have any major influence on the shape of _LOCATION_ transients in planta . to investigate if the regulatory impact of micu on mitochondrial dynamics can be connected to structural properties of cellular organization we performed transmission electron microscopy of root tips . a proportion of the mitochondrial populations observed showed _PROTEIN_ electron density and disorganization toward the center of their _PROTEIN_ . yet cristae were still clearly visible toward the periphery and appeared more tubular compared with the control where cristae generally showed typical saccular configuration . mitochondria with such abnormal internal ultrastructure were significantly enriched in the elongation zone of the micu lines compared with their corresponding controls . in the root apex the number of abnormal mitochondria was generally low although micu also contained significantly more translucent mitochondria in this area compared with its corresponding wild type . no change in mitochondrial shape or size was evident . to check if the ultrastructural changes indicated mitochondrial function being more generally altered in the micu lines we assessed respiration of purified intact mitochondria from whole seedlings . this allows a detailed appraisal of the mitochondrial respiratory machinery at the cost of losing tissue specific effects by averaging over large numbers of mitochondria from all tissues . for all preparations outer _LOCATION_ integrity was > as measured by cytochrome c _PROTEIN_ . we could not detect significant changes for the oxygen consumption rates of micu mitochondria in state i v and in response to inhibition of kcn sensitive transport and alternative oxidase nor for respiratory control and p o ratio . this indicated that the respiratory machinery remained functional and efficient in the micu lines . yet we observed a tendency of _PROTEIN_ maximal rates _PROTEIN_ in the micu mitochondria under succinate respiration . by contrast this was not the case under pyruvate/malate respiration where this trend appeared even inverted i.e. increased maximal rates in micu mitochondria . since the different substrates provide electrons to the ubiquinone pool of the electron transport chain via distinct import and dehydrogenase _METHOD_ respiratory capacities may be independently adjusted with limitations becoming apparent in oxygen consumption at maximal rates . to test this hypothesis we assessed the ratio of ocrs under pyruvate/malate driven compared with succinate driven state iii respiration . this ratio was consistently increased in all six micu mitochondrial preparations compared with their corresponding wild type mitochondria but only reached significance for micu versus col . alterations in electron flux stoichiometry suggest changes in the respiratory machinery that are permanent enough to be preserved in isolated organelles under the in vitro conditions employed . since those conditions do not preserve physiological status and can not be straightforwardly compared with the in vivo situation we also assayed respiration in intact roots . oxygen consumption rates were unchanged between the lines under control conditions and after successive treatment with the cytochrome c oxidase inhibitor kcn and the alternative oxidase inhibitor propylgallate . those data suggest no overall changes in root respiratory rate and in the capacities of both terminal oxidases at whole tissue level . they do not provide details on the mechanistic organization of respiration nor on specific tissue areas or cell types however which deserve detailed investigation in the future . to find out if the observed functional and structural phenotypes at mitochondrial and cellular level carry through to the whole plant we compared the micu and micu lines against their specific wild type backgrounds for developmental phenotypes . employing a stringent and highly reproducible quantitative assessment regime we could not observe any consistent differences throughout the life cycle of soil grown plants . precedence for the importance of regulation mitochondrial function and environmental stimuli for root development prompted us to also quantify primary root growth performance of seedlings on media plates under normal growth conditions and a set of abiotic stress conditions . all stress conditions led to _PROTEIN_ root growth yet none triggered any significant change in growth between micu and the corresponding wild type plants within d of stress exposure . although our phenotype analysis can not be comprehensive it suggests that absence of micu has a pronounced impact on mitochondrial and is associated with alterations of the mitochondrial ultrastructure and the respiratory machinery but does not lead to detectable changes in overall root respiration or visible alterations of whole plant development .
