light in a quality and quantity dependent fashion induces _LOCATION_ import of the plant photoreceptors phytochrome promotes interaction of phytochrome a _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with transcription _PROTEIN_ including phytochrome interacting _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and is thought to trigger a transcriptional cascade to regulate the _PROTEIN_ of genes in arabidopsis thaliana . here we show that controlled degradation of the transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is a major regulatory step in light signaling . we demonstrate that accumulation of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ in dark requires constitutive photomorphogenesis _PROTEIN_ a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis and show that red and far red light induce rapid degradation of the _PROTEIN_ protein . this process is controlled by the concerted action of the r/fr absorbing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ photoreceptors and it is not affected by _PROTEIN_ . rapid light induced degradation of _PROTEIN_ indicates that interaction of _PROTEIN_ with these phytochrome species is transient . in addition we provide evidence that the _PROTEIN_ mutant a postulated _PROTEIN_ overexpressor that displays hypersensitivity to r but not to fr lacks detectable amounts of the _PROTEIN_ protein . thus we propose that _PROTEIN_ acts transiently and its major function is to mediate phytochrome induced signaling during the developmental switch from skotomorphogenesis to photomorphogenesis and/or dark to light transitions .
to analyze the intracellular localization of _PROTEIN_ in plants grown under various light conditions we produced transgenic arabidopsis lines _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene under the control of the promoter of the cauliflower mosaic virus . figure illustrates that the selected _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic lines showed a moderate hyposensitivity to r irradiation . this result is in contrast with the previously reported hypersensitive phenotype of transgenic lines overexpressing _PROTEIN_ but it is in good agreement with data reported by citation . _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein in the transgenic lines were then determined by protein gel blot hybridization using an antibody recognizing _PROTEIN_ . figures and show that the antibody raised against _PROTEIN_ cross reacts with other proteins but is sufficiently specific to monitor accumulation levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein . figure also illustrates that transgenic lines chosen for further studies overexpressed the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins as compared with the wild type . we next monitored the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in seedlings grown in constant dark or light after imbibition . figure demonstrates that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein is not detectable in seeds after imbibition . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ reaches detectable levels only when the radicle has already broken through the seed coat mostly around day after induction of germination . at _PROTEIN_ developmental stages the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein is detected as diffuse staining exclusively in the _LOCATION_ . it is _PROTEIN_ in all cell types examined in etiolated seedlings . by contrast we had difficulties detecting any accumulation of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein in any cells of the same homozygous seedlings grown in constant light . similar data were obtained when the spatial and temporal distribution of the _PROTEIN_ protein fused to _METHOD_ was analyzed . although unexpected these observations indicate that light may either regulate the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ at the transcriptional/posttranscriptional level or modulate the stability/turnover rate of the _PROTEIN_ protein itself . to determine whether light rapidly downregulates _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ at the level of transcription we analyzed steady state levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mrna using total rna extracts prepared from seedlings grown under different light conditions . rnase protection experiments showed that neither the _PROTEIN_ of the endogenous _PROTEIN_ nor that of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene is rapidly downregulated by light . we note however that levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mrnas are significantly higher at early stages of development . we next examined the accumulation and subcellular distribution of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein in seedlings irradiated with light of different wavelengths . thus we monitored _PROTEIN_ and nucleocytoplasmic distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in d old etiolated seedlings irradiated with fr . figures and show that before light treatment _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulates in the _LOCATION_ . irradiation with fr strongly affected the level and cellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . fr treatment promoted rapid formation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ containing speckles reminiscent of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ speckles described by citation and dramatically changed the distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ within the _LOCATION_ . more interestingly irradiation with fr induced rapid disappearance of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the cells of the wild type . however the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein reaccumulated in the wild type when the seedlings were kept for h in darkness after a short fr treatment . in seedlings lacking _PROTEIN_ the accumulation level of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was not affected either by pulse treatment or by irradiation with cfr for at least h . furthermore in wild type but not in _PROTEIN_ deficient seedlings a second fr treatment given at any time after reaccumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ reached detectable levels in the dark induced a new cycle of speckle formation followed by the disappearance of the fusion protein from the _LOCATION_ in min . these observations strongly suggest that fr induces rapid degradation of _PROTEIN_ and that this process is controlled by _PROTEIN_ . short r irradiation also efficiently induced rapid formation of _LOCATION_ speckles containing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and subsequent degradation of the fusion protein . we found that within min _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ disappeared from the _LOCATION_ of wild type and _PROTEIN_ deficient seedlings and it was also not detectable in the cytoplasm . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ however reaccumulated in darkness as diffuse staining in the _LOCATION_ of wild type and _PROTEIN_ deficient seedlings during an additional h incubation . the _PROTEIN_ that r treatment efficiently promotes degradation of _PROTEIN_ in mutant seedlings lacking _PROTEIN_ indicates that besides _PROTEIN_ other phytochrome species also control this response . this hypothesis was corroborated by the following experiments . first a series of protein gel blot hybridization experiments was performed to determine the kinetics of the degradation of the _PROTEIN_ protein . to this end total protein extracts were prepared from wild type seedlings grown in the dark and treated by various light qualities . figure clearly demonstrates that _PROTEIN_ accumulates in the dark min of r does not significantly affect the abundance of _PROTEIN_ and min of r already _PROTEIN_ the level of the _PROTEIN_ protein whereas after min min and h of r the amount of _PROTEIN_ is below the level of detection . as expected these light treatments also promoted degradation of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein . figure shows that accumulation of the endogenous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was readily detectable by the antibody used . accumulation level of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein similar to that of the endogenous _PROTEIN_ was the highest in etiolated transgenic seedlings and r treatment induced degradation of both the endogenous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein . this figure also shows that h of r irradiation was sufficient to _PROTEIN_ the amount even of the more highly _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein below detection level . we obtained a similar degradation pattern for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under these conditions . fr irradiation of etiolated seedlings similarly to r treatment also resulted in a gradual _PROTEIN_ of the abundance of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . second another series of protein gel blot hybridizations was performed to identify the photoreceptors controlling r and fr induced turnover of the _PROTEIN_ protein . to this end wild type and mutant seedlings lacking various phytochrome species were grown in the dark and subjected to h of fr or r illumination . total protein extracts prepared from dark grown and illuminated plant material were then used to determine the amount of _PROTEIN_ protein in these samples . figure shows that _PROTEIN_ accumulated to the same level in etiolated wild type and various phytochrome deficient seedlings . this figure also demonstrates that fr treatment induced rapid degradation of _PROTEIN_ in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings . thus we concluded that the fr induced degradation of _PROTEIN_ is controlled by _PROTEIN_ . in contrast with fr r treatment induces rapid degradation of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings indicating that other phy species are also involved in regulating turnover of _PROTEIN_ . analysis of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant showed that _PROTEIN_ plays a role in regulating this process . figure shows that r induced degradation of _PROTEIN_ is slower in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants than it is in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants or the wild type because a residual amount of _PROTEIN_ is still readily detectable after h of r treatment . by contrast neither r nor fr treatment affected accumulation level of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutant background . in this case the amount of _PROTEIN_ detected in the total protein extract isolated from etiolated and r illuminated seedlings did not differ after h or several hours of illumination . these data demonstrate that different signaling pathways initiated by these phytochrome species mediate fr and r induced degradation of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was shown to be a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis . _PROTEIN_ mutants display a constitutive photomorphogenetic phenotype in the dark and show a characteristic hypersensitive phenotype in light . genetic and biochemical evidence indicates that _PROTEIN_ controls light signaling by regulating the degradation of several key transcription _PROTEIN_ . this conclusion is supported by recent reports showing that _PROTEIN_ acting as an ligase directs _PROTEIN_ and in the presence of the _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ to the proteasome . similarly to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was also postulated to act as a positive regulator of photomorphogenesis . however we found that _PROTEIN_ in contrast with _PROTEIN_ accumulated efficiently in the _LOCATION_ of dark grown seedlings and turned over rapidly upon illumination by light . these findings prompted us to examine the possible role of _PROTEIN_ in mediating the light induced proteolysis of _PROTEIN_ . quite unexpectedly we found that the accumulation level of _PROTEIN_ in dark grown _PROTEIN_ seedlings was significantly lower than in the wild type and the residual amount of _PROTEIN_ detected in dark grown _PROTEIN_ seedlings degraded quickly similarly to the wild type upon illumination by r or fr . these data shown in figure indicate that _PROTEIN_ does not play a significant role in mediating the light induced turnover of _PROTEIN_ protein but is required for its high level accumulation in the dark . to corroborate these findings we monitored the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ protein in a new _PROTEIN_ allele designated eid . in contrast with _PROTEIN_ which displays constitutive photomorphogenic phenotype eid has no dark phenotype yet it shows a _PROTEIN_ dependent hypersensitive light phenotype . figure demonstrates that the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ in dark grown eid seedlings was significantly inhibited as compared with dark grown wild type seedlings whereas the light induced degradation of _PROTEIN_ was as rapid and complete as in wild type seedlings . these data provide evidence that _PROTEIN_ promotes the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ protein in dark grown seedlings independently of the manifestation of the characteristic _PROTEIN_ constitutive photomorphogenic phenotype and _PROTEIN_ does not affect the light induced turnover of the _PROTEIN_ protein . furthermore we conclude that a low level of _PROTEIN_ is not sufficient for the manifestation of the constitutive photomorphogenic phenotype . these findings prompted us to characterize the accumulation and light induced degradation of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . according to citation the _PROTEIN_ mutant contains a t dna insertion at the untranslated region of the _PROTEIN_ gene . the authors showed that _PROTEIN_ seedlings display a hypersensitive hypocotyl elongation inhibition response in cr but not in cfr . furthermore the authors reported that _PROTEIN_ seedlings grown in cr have elevated levels of _PROTEIN_ mrna as compared with the wild type thus they classified the _PROTEIN_ mutant as a _PROTEIN_ overexpressor . however citation and we found that transgenic seedlings overexpressing the _PROTEIN_ mrna exhibited hyposensitivity to r. moreover citation reported that _PROTEIN_ mutants lacking a detectable amount of _PROTEIN_ mrna displayed hypersensitivity to cr concerning inhibition of hypocotyl elongation a phenotype conspicuously similar to that of the _PROTEIN_ . to solve the discrepancy between these reports we determined the accumulation level of _PROTEIN_ protein in dark and cr grown _PROTEIN_ and wild type seedlings . we found that total protein extracts prepared from _PROTEIN_ seedlings grown in dark or cr did not contain detectable amounts of the _PROTEIN_ protein . these data provide evidence that the _PROTEIN_ mutant is a _PROTEIN_ null mutant and that _PROTEIN_ acts negatively in signaling cascades regulating hypocotyl elongation of arabidopsis seedlings in cr . citation and we found that the _PROTEIN_ mutation does not affect the rate of hypocotyl growth in cfr . thus we conclude that _PROTEIN_ although fr can also induce its degradation is not involved in signaling that mediates _PROTEIN_ controlled hypocotyl growth . _PROTEIN_ is a bhlh transcription _PROTEIN_ which has been shown to interact with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in vitro and postulated to play a key role in mediating phytochrome controlled light signaling . this working model ascertains a sustained interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ and other signaling molecules . here however we show that the dynamics of _PROTEIN_ degradation are astonishingly fast the half life for degradation is min in r . this finding is in conflict with the proposed model and to overcome this apparent discrepancy we analyzed the level and subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ and its postulated interacting partners _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as well as that of _PROTEIN_ which has been shown to be involved in r induced degradation of _PROTEIN_ in planta . to this end we produced transgenic arabidopsis lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ together with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins . the _PROTEIN_ of each chimeric gene was under the control of the viral promoter . _PROTEIN_ levels of the fusion proteins were determined by protein gel blot hybridization . figure shows that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localizes exclusively to the cytoplasm whereas _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulates in the _LOCATION_ of etiolated seedlings . a short fr treatment induces translocation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and formation of speckles containing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . overlay of the microscopic images indicates that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins are colocalized in the _LOCATION_ . an extended fr treatment leads to the disappearance of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ staining whereas the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ staining first becomes diffuse before newly formed _PROTEIN_ speckles appear . a short r treatment also induces translocation of _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ speckle formation and colocalization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ therein . extended r treatment however results in the complete loss of both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . analysis of transgenic plants coexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein confirmed fr induced degradation of _PROTEIN_ . a short fr pulse induced formation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ but not _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ containing speckles whereas extended fr treatment led to the disappearance of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ without affecting the abundance of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins . a short r illumination of these seedlings however efficiently promoted the formation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ as well as _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ speckles . overlay pictures of the speckles indicate that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ colocalizes transiently with both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . an extended r treatment again triggered rapid loss of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ whereas _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ staining first became diffuse and then newly formed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ containing speckles appeared . figure illustrates studies performed on seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . we note that the number and size of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ speckles formed immediately after a short r treatment is characteristically different from those appearing after extended r illumination _PROTEIN_ . in earlier studies citation monitored only the formation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ containing speckles in seedlings exposed to light . we therefore tested whether the appearance of early _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ speckles in the double transgenic lines was because of the elevated levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins as compared with previous experiments . to this end we generated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background . the kinetics of the appearance of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ speckles after various r treatments was then analyzed in the _PROTEIN_ and the wild type backgrounds . plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in wild type and _PROTEIN_ backgrounds at the same levels were chosen for further studies . figure demonstrates that a short r treatment similar to the early appearance of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ speckles in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ lines promotes formation of early and transient _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ speckles in the wild type background . this observation indicates that different _PROTEIN_ levels of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene can not be accounted for in the appearance of early _PROTEIN_ containing speckles in the wild type background . by contrast however we failed to detect early _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ speckles in the _PROTEIN_ mutant lacking detectable amounts of _PROTEIN_ protein . furthermore we found that after extended r treatment _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ speckles appeared in a similar fashion in all these transgenic plants independently of their genetic backgrounds . these data strongly suggest that the presence of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ is critical for the formation of early _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ but not of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ speckles and these two types of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ speckles consist of different proteins .

saci fragments into the binary vector containing the promoter and the nopalin synthase terminator . the binary vector containing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was
