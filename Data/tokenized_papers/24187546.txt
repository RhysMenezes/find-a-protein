myosin xi motor proteins transport plant organelles on the actin _LOCATION_ . the arabidopsis gene family that encodes myosin xi has members of which have sub domains within the tail region that are homologous to well characterized cargo binding domains in the yeast myosin v . little is presently known about the cargo binding domains of plant myosin xis . prior experiments in which most or all of the tail regions of myosin xis have been fused to yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and transiently _PROTEIN_ have often not resulted in _METHOD_ labeling of plant organelles . we identified amino acid regions within arabidopsis myosin xis that are homologous to the yeast tail region known to be essential for _LOCATION_ and mitochondrial inheritance . a _METHOD_ fusion of the yeast region _PROTEIN_ in plants did not label tonoplasts or mitochondria . we investigated whether the homologous arabidopsis regions termed by us the _PROTEIN_ sub domain could associate with subcellular structures following transient _PROTEIN_ of fusions with _METHOD_ in nicotiana benthamiana . seven _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ sub domain fusions decorated _LOCATION_ and six were localized to mitochondria . in general the myosin xi _PROTEIN_ sub domains labeled organelles whose motility had previously been observed to be affected by mutagenesis or dominant negative assays with the respective myosins . simultaneous transient _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ sub domains of myosin xi h xi i and xi k resulted in inhibition of movement of mitochondria and _LOCATION_ .
in the yeast myosin there is a amino acid section that has been shown by mutagenesis to be critical for _LOCATION_ inheritance . mutations in this region also affect mitochondrial inheritance _PROTEIN_ . a amino acid region encompassing the amino acids is highly conserved between yeast and plants and among the different plant myosin xis . based on the structure template homology models of globular tails of all a. thaliana class xi myosins were built . the three dimensional structures that were obtained indicate that the predicted general architecture of the _PROTEIN_ sub domain in class xi myosins is very similar to that of . the models indicate that the amino acid sections homologous to the corresponding yeast sections are predicted to be exposed on the surface of the polypeptides when the amino acid regions we _PROTEIN_ are modeled . previously we have fused the _PROTEIN_ sub domain from arabidopsis myosin xi f to _METHOD_ and have shown that the fusion protein labels _LOCATION_ and stromules . we have now made constructs with the remaining _PROTEIN_ sub domains from the arabidopsis class xi myosins fused to _METHOD_ at the n terminus . we report _METHOD_ fusion information for xi c and xi e together because the _PROTEIN_ domains of these two myosin xis are identical . the localization of the _METHOD_ fusion proteins was examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy _PROTEIN_ in leaf epidermal cells of n. benthamiana following agroinfiltration . except for the _METHOD_ at xi _PROTEIN_ fusion all tested fusions labeled vesicles in the same size range as the _LOCATION_ endosomes and mitochondria . the _METHOD_ fusions with myosin xi failed to localize to any vesicular structures and strongly labeled the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the _METHOD_ fusion with the at xi a _PROTEIN_ sub domain was usually seen also in the cytoplasm however some unidentified vesicular structures were sometimes observed in a few cells . _METHOD_ fusion with the homologous region in yeast _LOCATION_ resulted in diffuse cytoplasmic labeling in plant cells but some punctate loci could be discerned at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_

of myosins xi xi d xi g xi h xi i and xi k co localized with the _LOCATION_ marker . some but not all _LOCATION_ were labeled by the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion of myosin xi b . vesicles labeled by

exhibited _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ vesicles and _LOCATION_ envelopes . the positive and negative co localizations are summarized in table . transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ fusions of a. thaliana class xi

and transiently _PROTEIN_ in leaves epidermal cells of n. benthamiana . organelles that were observed not to co localize with a particular myosin are shown in italics . high levels of _PROTEIN_ are often achieved following agroinfiltration . when a myosin tail domain lacking the motor function is _PROTEIN_ a dominant negative effect on motility can sometimes be detected . however when we examined the vesicles labeled by the _METHOD_ at _PROTEIN_ sub domains we found that rapid motility was retained in contrast to our prior observation of stationary vesicles following agroinfiltration of _METHOD_ at dil domain fusions . motility is documented in figures and movies in supplementary material . in order to determine whether a dominant negative effect on movement might occur if multiple _PROTEIN_ sub domains were _PROTEIN_ we agroinfiltrated simultaneously four strains containing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ sub domain fusions from myosins xi h xi i and xi k along with a strain carrying either a mcherry marker for _LOCATION_ or for mitochondria . about a third of the cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ exhibited _METHOD_ labeled vesicles that were stationery or poorly motile . agroinfiltration does not result in all cells in a leaf _PROTEIN_ the transgenes so some cells may be _PROTEIN_ only one or two of the _PROTEIN_ sub domain fusions . we show an example of two adjacent cells one of which is _PROTEIN_ one or more _METHOD_ labeled _PROTEIN_ sub domains localized to nearly immobile vesicles while an adjacent cell is _PROTEIN_ only the mcherry mitochondrial marker and therefore exhibits motile mitochondria . we provide an example of a cell _PROTEIN_ mcherry _LOCATION_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ sub domains located on immobile vesicles in movie . when the mcherry _LOCATION_ marker is infiltrated by itself the _LOCATION_ exhibit high motility . we also observed minimal motility of _METHOD_ labeled vesicles in many cells when we co infiltrated three strains containing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ sub domain fusions from myosins xi h xi i and xi k without simultaneous co infiltration of a strain carrying an organelle marker . in figure we provide three panels from a movie that illustrate movement of vesicles labeled with _METHOD_ xi k _PROTEIN_ when it is _PROTEIN_ alone however in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ n. benthamiana leaves were infiltrated with an agrobacterium strain carrying a _METHOD_ at xi k _PROTEIN_ sub domain . leaves were infiltrated simultaneously with three agrobacterium strains _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ each of which contained a transgene with one _PROTEIN_ sub domain fused to _METHOD_ . time lapse series were obtained by confocal microscope . only three frames are shown . time is indicated in seconds . bar um . an arrow marks an organelle that is in different positions in a c .
generation of the _METHOD_ myosin constructs was performed as described using standard topo and gateway cloning system . the primers used are listed in table in supplementary material . plant growth and agroinfiltration was done as described . when multiple strains were infiltrated the same total concentration of bacteria was used as for single infiltration . for labeling of mitochondria _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ stacks and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ with mcherry _METHOD_ protein binary vectors and _PROTEIN_ were used respectively . according to nelson et al . _PROTEIN_ the mitochondrial marker was made by fusing the first amino acids from the n terminus of yeast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to mcherry the peroxisomal targeting signal ser lys leu _PROTEIN_ to mcherry and the _LOCATION_ marker resulted from fusion of the first amino acids of soybean mannosidase i to mcherry . the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ marker was made by sattarzadeh et al . by fusing the first n terminal amino acids of a rat sialyl transferase . for dna staining by diamidino phenylindole leaves were immersed in a solution of nm dapi . cslm was performed on a leica microscope equipped with a tcs confocal scanning head _METHOD_ as described . movies were captured by using an andor xd revolution spinning disc confocal microscope . infiltrations of each _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion were performed at separate times and approximately cells in total were observed for each _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion . the images shown represent the appearance of the majority of the labeling patterns for each fusion . we note in the text if an image is provided of labeling pattern that was only rarely observed . genedoc was used for generation of alignments _PROTEIN_ . percent identity and divergence between arabidopsis and n. benthamiana myosin xi _PROTEIN_ domains was generated with the _PROTEIN_ megalign program . structure homology models for the tail domain of class xi mysoins were built by swissmodel _PROTEIN_ based on the structure template . pymol was used for drawing the structural homology models . the authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest .
