_LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ stress is defined as the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and is caused by conditions such as heat or agents that cause _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ stress including tunicamycin and dithiothreitol . autophagy a major pathway for degradation of macromolecules in the _LOCATION_ is activated by these stress agents in a manner dependent on inositol requiring enzyme _PROTEIN_ and delivers _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fragments to the _LOCATION_ for degradation . in this study we examined the mechanism for activation of autophagy during _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ stress in arabidopsis thaliana . the chemical chaperones sodium phenylbutyrate and tauroursodeoxycholic acid were found to reduce tunicamycin or dithiothreitol induced autophagy but not autophagy caused by unrelated stresses . similarly over _PROTEIN_ of binding _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ encoding a heat shock protein _PROTEIN_ molecular chaperone reduced autophagy . autophagy activated by heat stress was also found to be partially dependent on _PROTEIN_ and to be inhibited by sodium phenylbutyrate suggesting that heat induced autophagy is due to accumulation of unfolded proteins in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis of the misfolded protein mimics zeolin or a mutated form of _PROTEIN_ y _PROTEIN_ also induced autophagy in an _PROTEIN_ dependent manner . moreover zeolin and _PROTEIN_ partially co localized with the autophagic body marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ indicating delivery to the _LOCATION_ by autophagy . we conclude that accumulation of unfolded proteins in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ is a trigger for autophagy under conditions that cause _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ stress .
previously we showed that the _LOCATION_ stress agents tm and dtt trigger autophagy in arabidopsis . _PROTEIN_ and tudca are chemical chaperones that reduce _LOCATION_ stress induced programmed cell death in arabidopsis . _PROTEIN_ and tudca stabilize unfolded proteins and prevent their aggregation thus helping to relieve _LOCATION_ stress . here these chemical chaperones were used to study the effect of accumulation of unfolded proteins in the _LOCATION_ lumen on autophagy activation . we hypothesized that as _PROTEIN_ and tudca reduce the accumulation of unfolded proteins they may prevent the induction of autophagy upon treatment with tm or dtt . seven day old wild type and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic seedlings grown on solid medium were transferred to liquid medium containing tm or dtt or tm or dtt plus _PROTEIN_ or tudca for h. _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is an autophagosome localized _METHOD_ protein fusion that is well characterized as an autophagy marker . wt seedlings were stained with the autophagosome selective dye monodansylcadaverine and visualized by _METHOD_ microscopy . the number of mdc or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labeled autophagosomes was quantified per section . as expected seedlings treated with tm or dtt had significantly more autophagosomes than the solvent control . however when seedlings were co treated with _PROTEIN_ or tudca and tm or dtt the number of autophagosomes was significantly reduced compared to tm or dtt treatment alone . the reduction in autophagosome number upon tudca treatment of dtt treated samples was only marginally significant due to the high variation in autophagosome number . our previous study showed that the number of autophagosomes correlates with induction of autophagy under these conditions . therefore these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ and tudca inhibit induction of autophagy during _LOCATION_ stress by reducing the load of unfolded proteins . to examine whether the effect of chemical chaperones is specific for autophagy caused by _LOCATION_ stress agents the effect of _PROTEIN_ on _PROTEIN_ starvation induced autophagy was examined . _PROTEIN_ starvation induced autophagy is regulated by an nadph oxidase dependent signaling pathway which is distinct from that caused by _LOCATION_ stress . seven day old wt seedlings were transferred to medium without sucrose and incubated in the dark for days to produce a fixed _PROTEIN_ deficiency . on the day seedlings were transferred to liquid medium supplemented with _PROTEIN_ but without sucrose . after h incubation seedlings were stained with mdc and the number of autophagosomes per section was counted . the control seedlings for sucrose starvation had a higher basal level of autophagy than controls for _LOCATION_ stress treatments as the seedlings were older in the starvation assays . _PROTEIN_ treatment was found to have no effect on the number of autophagosomes during starvation . we conclude that _PROTEIN_ specifically prevents autophagy during _LOCATION_ stress and not during _PROTEIN_ starvation . this is most likely due to the chaperone function of _PROTEIN_ reducing unfolded protein accumulation in the _LOCATION_ lumen . this suggests that accumulation of unfolded proteins in the _LOCATION_ is an upstream signal that induces autophagy specifically in response to _LOCATION_ stress agents . munch et al . recently showed in a study of benzothiadiazole induced cell death that autophagy defective mutants are more sensitive to benzothiadiazole a salicylic acid agonist and that tm treatment enhanced this sensitivity . however their results showed that a low concentration of tm alone does not influence growth of autophagy defective mutants . based on our previous results showing that tm induces autophagy and the observation that _PROTEIN_ reduces tm induced autophagy we hypothesized that autophagy defective arabidopsis mutants may be hypersensitive to higher concentrations of tm and that this sensitivity may be rescued by _PROTEIN_ co treatment . to determine the effect of tm and _PROTEIN_ on their growth and survival wt _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seeds were plated on half strength _METHOD_ medium or medium containing tm or containing tm and _PROTEIN_ . the percentage of surviving seedlings was determined after weeks . seedlings were classified into two groups survival was defined as seedlings that had two green cotyledons and two green true leaves seedlings with yellow leaves or cotyledons were defined as dead . on control medium _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings grew similarly to wt . however on tm containing medium _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants had a significantly lower survival than wt . with _PROTEIN_ co treatment the survival percentages for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were significantly higher compared to tm treatment alone . this result indicates that autophagy contributes to _LOCATION_ stress tolerance and that reducing unfolded protein levels using _PROTEIN_ increases the _LOCATION_ stress tolerance of autophagy mutants . bip is an abundant molecular chaperone in the _LOCATION_ lumen that prevents protein aggregation and assists in protein folding . in plants bip _PROTEIN_ increases upon _LOCATION_ stress via the upr . we hypothesized that if autophagy is activated due to accumulation of unfolded proteins in the _LOCATION_ lumen bip should antagonize this activation similarly to _PROTEIN_ and tudca . to address this hypothesis the induction of autophagy by dtt in bip over _PROTEIN_ transgenic arabidopsis plants was assessed . seven day old seedlings of two independent _PROTEIN_ oe lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ oe lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were incubated in liquid medium supplemented with mm dtt for h followed by staining with mdc to detect autophagosomes . all oe lines showed significantly _PROTEIN_ autophagy compared with wt seedlings upon dtt treatment . this suggests that bip reduces dtt induced autophagy presumably by reducing the load of unfolded proteins in the _LOCATION_ . however it should be noted that over _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ did not reduce the basal level of autophagy . to confirm this result leaf protoplasts isolated from week old _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ plants as representative lines transiently _PROTEIN_ a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein were treated with dtt and concanamycin a for h. cona is a _LOCATION_ h _PROTEIN_ inhibitor that inhibits the degradation of autophagic bodies leading to their accumulation in the _LOCATION_ . autophagy was defined as activated in cells with more than three autophagic bodies as determined by _METHOD_ microscopy as wt cells typically have a basal autophagy level of fewer than three autophagic bodies per cell . upon dtt treatment a significantly lower percentage of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ protoplasts showed active autophagy compared to wt . based on these results we conclude that the molecular chaperone bip prevented dtt induced autophagy by reducing the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the _LOCATION_ lumen . heat produces _LOCATION_ stress in arabidopsis as demonstrated by the splicing of _PROTEIN_ mrna by _PROTEIN_ and by bip up regulation . in addition the autophagy defective mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are more sensitive to heat stress than wt arabidopsis . we hypothesized that elevated temperature increases accumulation of unfolded proteins in the _LOCATION_ leading to _LOCATION_ stress that in turn activates autophagy . previously heat stress was shown to adversely affect the growth of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ adult plants . to confirm this result under conditions in which autophagy may easily be monitored we examined the effect of heat stress on young arabidopsis seedlings . seven day old wt _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings were incubated at for h followed by days of recovery at room temperature . seedlings subjected to heat treatment were classified in two groups survivors defined as seedlings with two green cotyledons and two green true leaves or non surviving seedlings with yellow leaves or cotyledons . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants had a significantly lower percentage of surviving seedlings than wt . this confirmed that autophagy defective mutants have less tolerance to heat stress at the seedling stage . to examine whether heat stress induces autophagy in young seedlings day old wt _PROTEIN_ mutant and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic seedlings grown on solid medium were transferred to liquid medium and incubated at for h in the dark or at room temperature as a control . samples were incubated at room temperature for h after heat stress a time point at which the upr is initiated . wt and _PROTEIN_ seedlings were then stained with mdc to assess autophagy autophagosomes were visualized directly in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants . significantly more autophagosomes were observed upon exposure to heat stress than in the room temperature control . very few punctate structures were seen in the _PROTEIN_ mutant confirming that the punctate structures are autophagosomes . these results confirmed that heat stress induces autophagy in young arabidopsis seedlings . we showed above that _PROTEIN_ reduces tm or dtt induced autophagy suggesting that accumulation of unfolded proteins is an activator of autophagy . therefore we tested whether heat stress induced autophagy is also caused by accumulation of unfolded proteins . seven day old wt and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic seedlings grown on solid medium were incubated in liquid medium at for h followed by incubation at room temperature for h in the presence of _PROTEIN_ . the number of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or mdc labeled autophagosomes per section was quantified . significantly fewer autophagosomes were seen in heat stressed seedlings with _PROTEIN_ treatment compared to a control without addition of _PROTEIN_ . these results indicate that heat stress induced autophagy is also caused by accumulation of unfolded proteins in the _LOCATION_ . if heat stress induces autophagy via the upr disruption of _PROTEIN_ function would be expected to block induction of autophagy upon heat stress . seven day old and wt seedlings were incubated at for h followed by a h room temperature incubation and stained with mdc to assess autophagy activation . as expected wt seedlings have a basal level of autophagy under normal conditions and autophagy was induced by heat stress . the mutant showed a slight induction of autophagy with heat stress but this was significantly lower than that in the wt with heat stress . in summary our results indicate that heat stress induces autophagy primarily through the _PROTEIN_ arm of the upr via accumulation of unfolded proteins in the _LOCATION_ lumen . zeolin is a recombinant protein fusion between phaseolin from bean and zein from maize that is retained in the _LOCATION_ due to the replacement of the n terminal _LOCATION_ sorting signal of phaseolin by zein and inter chain disulfide bond formation which causes protein aggregation _PROTEIN_ . based on these characteristics we hypothesized that zeolin mimics a constitutively misfolded protein and will therefore induce _LOCATION_ stress and autophagy . to enable easy visualization of zeolin it was fused with the _METHOD_ protein cerulean and transiently _PROTEIN_ from a promoter . arabidopsis leaf protoplasts isolated from week old plants were transformed using an _LOCATION_ marker _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ zeolin cerulean or both constructs together and incubated in the dark for h. the fusion proteins were visualized by confocal microscopy . control experiments with _PROTEIN_ of either fusion protein alone confirmed that there was no _METHOD_ bleed through between the two channels . upon co _PROTEIN_ of _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ and free cerulean _METHOD_ labeled the _LOCATION_ network and cerulean was _PROTEIN_ diffuse in the _LOCATION_ . upon zeolin cerulean and _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ co transformation cerulean labeled punctate and aggregated structures co localized with the _METHOD_ labeled _LOCATION_ network . _METHOD_ profiling showed extensive overlap of these two _METHOD_ signals . previous research showed that zeolin tends to aggregate _PROTEIN_ and we found the zeolin accumulated in the _LOCATION_ therefore we hypothesize that zeolin _METHOD_ aggregates in the _LOCATION_ lumen . as shown in figure and figure the _PROTEIN_ of zeolin led to changes in the morphology of the _LOCATION_ network with many aggregate like structures present . this suggests that the _LOCATION_ network may be undergoing degradation or reorganization to counteract zeolin aggregation and _LOCATION_ stress . therefore we further hypothesized that aggregation of zeolin in the _LOCATION_ may induce autophagy by causing _LOCATION_ stress . to test this hypothesis we first examined the effect of zeolin on induction of the upr . arabidopsis protoplasts were transformed with zeolin cerulean or free cerulean constructs and incubated in the dark for h. protoplasts were harvested followed by total rna extraction and cdna synthesis . to assess the activation of the upr the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ level and the amount of spliced _PROTEIN_ were examined by quantitative rt pcr using gene specific primers . the like gene was used as an internal control and for normalization . the amount of the spliced form of _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts _PROTEIN_ zeolin cerulean was fold higher than that in the control whereas _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was fold higher than that in the control . this indicates that zeolin _PROTEIN_ causes _LOCATION_ stress and activation of the upr in arabidopsis . second we examined the effect of zeolin _PROTEIN_ on induction of autophagy . zeolin cerulean and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were co _PROTEIN_ in wt and mutant arabidopsis leaf protoplasts . transformed protoplasts were incubated in the dark for h followed by treatment with cona for h to block _LOCATION_ degradation . the percentage of protoplasts with activated autophagy was quantified . wt protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ alone had a low basal level of autophagy under normal conditions . as a positive control wt protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were treated with mm nacl for h and autophagy was significantly induced compared to control conditions . only a basal level of autophagy was seen in wt and mutant protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with free cerulean . however significantly induced autophagy was seen in wt but not in protoplasts when zeolin cerulean was _PROTEIN_ . these results indicated that autophagy is induced by zeolin _PROTEIN_ most likely due to accumulation of unfolded proteins in the _LOCATION_ lumen . moreover this induction is partially dependent on _PROTEIN_ . a mutated form of _PROTEIN_ y _PROTEIN_ which is located in the _LOCATION_ lumen in an unfolded state was used to confirm these results . _PROTEIN_ has been used as a model unfolded protein to study the _LOCATION_ associated degradation pathway in yeast mammalian cells and plants . similar to zeolin cerulean _PROTEIN_ cells significant induction of autophagy was seen in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transformed protoplasts . when zeolin cerulean or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transformed protoplasts were treated with mm _PROTEIN_ for h the number of autophagosomes was significantly reduced . these results indicate that autophagy is induced by zeolin or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ most likely due to their accumulation as unfolded or misfolded proteins in the _LOCATION_ lumen . autophagy plays an important role in degradation of the _LOCATION_ during _LOCATION_ stress . as accumulation of zeolin in the _LOCATION_ activated autophagy we hypothesized that autophagy is involved in the degradation of zeolin aggregates . to address this hypothesis leaf protoplasts were transformed with the zeolin cerulean and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ constructs followed by incubation in the dark for h. transformed protoplasts were treated with cona for h and visualized by confocal microscopy . control experiments with _PROTEIN_ of either fusion protein alone confirmed that there was no _METHOD_ bleed through between the two channels . in protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and free cerulean _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cerulean and _METHOD_ were _PROTEIN_ diffuse in the cytoplasm . when _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and zeolin cerulean were co _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ zeolin cerulean was mostly localized in the _LOCATION_ as in figure and many autophagic bodies labeled by _METHOD_ were seen in the _LOCATION_ . diffuse cerulean signal was present in the _LOCATION_ which may be due to the delivery of zeolin cerulean through autophagy or via other pathways prior to addition of cona . moreover several punctate structures labeled by cerulean were also seen in the _LOCATION_ and they co localized with _METHOD_ labeled autophagic bodies . these results indicate that accumulation of zeolin in the _LOCATION_ lumen induces _LOCATION_ stress and autophagy and support the hypothesis that zeolin aggregates may be transported to the _LOCATION_ by autophagy . similar results were observed for _PROTEIN_ which co localized with cerulean _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ after cona treatment . whether these proteins are selected for transport by autophagy or are simply transported in bulk along with other _LOCATION_ constituents is unknown . in summary we demonstrated that zeolin _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is sufficient to induce the upr and autophagy confirming that accumulation of unfolded proteins is a trigger for autophagy during _LOCATION_ stress .
