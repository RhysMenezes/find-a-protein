the organization and dynamics of the genome have been shown to influence gene _PROTEIN_ in many _METHOD_ . data from mammalian tissue culture cells have provided conflicting conclusions with _PROTEIN_ to the extent to which chromatin organization is inherited from mother to daughter _LOCATION_ . to gain insight into chromatin organization and dynamics we developed transgenic arabidopsis lines in which centromeres were tagged with a green _METHOD_ protein fusion of the centromere specific histone . using four dimensional live cell imaging we show that arabidopsis centromeres are constrained at the _LOCATION_ periphery during interphase and that the organization of endoreduplicated sister centromeres is cell type dependent with predominant clustering in root epidermal cells and dispersion in leaf epidermal cells . d tracking of the entire set of centromeres through mitosis in growing root meristematic cells demonstrated that global centromere position is not precisely transmitted from the mother cell to daughter cells . these results provide important insight into our understanding of chromatin organization among different cells of a living organism .
to visualize centromeres in living arabidopsis plants amplified _PROTEIN_ genomic dna including the promoter region and untranslated region was fused in frame with venus a brighter variant of yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . in addition an endogenous terminator was used to control the stability of the fusion mrna . for double labeling of bulk chromatin a histone _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ was fused in frame with _METHOD_ which was also under control of its endogenous promoter and terminator . transgenic plants and progeny coexpressing _PROTEIN_ venus and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ grow normally without any obvious phenotypic changes indicating the cells _PROTEIN_ these fusions have functional centromeres and normal cell cycles . arabidopsis centromeres were observed as small bright _PROTEIN_ venus foci in _LOCATION_ labeled with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . ten spots were usually detected in diploid cell types corresponding to the centromeres in these cells . signal intensity variation was also observed especially in leaves where the strongest signals were detected in guard cells . it is not clear whether the observed differences in signal intensity in different cell types are correlated to cell type specific _PROTEIN_ or to differences in _PROTEIN_ deposition at centromeres . to investigate the localization of centromeres in d optical sections were collected from different cell types in living arabidopsis plants by d optical sectioning microscopy followed by image restoration using iterative deconvolution on a deltavision microscope . centromere positions in the _LOCATION_ were examined by analyzing individual image sections maximum signal intensity projections from different angles and volume view rotation videos . figure shows projection images of guard cell _LOCATION_ at different angles . because _PROTEIN_ venus labels all centromeres we could not define centromeres of specific chromosomes therefore in figure the centromeres are arbitrarily numbered . this figure represents a projection image of a image stack through the z axis of the cells shown at different rotation angles . the results reveal that all of the centromeres in a given guard cell _LOCATION_ localize at the _LOCATION_ periphery and are distributed all around the _LOCATION_ . although centromere _METHOD_ to be in the center of the _LOCATION_ in the rotation the rotation shows that it is at the periphery of the _LOCATION_ . importantly no obvious symmetric pattern can be observed in the two guard cells which are descendents of the same mother cell . spatial positioning of arabidopsis centromeres was quantified in several diploid cell types including guard cells _LOCATION_ small leaf epidermal pavement cells root meristematic cells and sepal and _PROTEIN_ epidermal pavement cells . the results demonstrated that centromeres in all of these cell types localize predominantly at the _LOCATION_ periphery . because endoreduplicated cells contain a significantly larger number of chromosomes it is of interest to investigate how sister centromeres are organized in such cells . we studied the organization of centromeres in larger leaf epidermal pavement cells and root epidermal cells in the differentiated region . these cells have larger and elongated _LOCATION_ with ploidy levels more than . in the _LOCATION_ of endoreduplicated root epidermal cells typically _METHOD_ foci could be detected . compared with the size of the _METHOD_ spots in cell types the tagged centromere foci in root epidermal cells are normally bigger and some foci with irregular shapes are composed of two to three clustered _METHOD_ spots indicating that the sister centromeres originating from endomitosis are clustered in root epidermal cells . interestingly in larger leaf epidermal pavement cells smaller foci could be detected indicating that endoreduplicated sister centromeres in these cells are more disassociated than those in the root epidermal cells . time lapse d image stacks were collected from root tips of transgenic seedlings growing in slide chambers to study the dynamics of centromeres during interphase . in initial experiments we found that long term excitation in the _METHOD_ channel caused bleaching of centromeric signals in the venus channel . therefore we labeled the centromeres with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which is more stable for imaging . for _METHOD_ single channel imaging the low degree of nucleoplasmic signal of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ served as a reference for _LOCATION_ shape . because roots were growing during the imaging time cell tracking was applied to center the cells of interest . the small _LOCATION_ size and peripheral positioning of centromeres in arabidopsis resulted in larger relative movements in projection images due to _LOCATION_ rotation . to characterize centromere dynamics in living plants with severe _LOCATION_ rotations we measured the distance between two centromeres in a single image section in which the centromeres were sustained in the focal plane . centromere motion was represented by plotting the overall mean square change in distance < > between two centromeres against elapsed time interval . if the two centromeres move freely a plot of < > against should increase continuously . if the movement is constrained to a certain area the plot will plateau in a limited time . we measured pairs of centromeres in a total of _LOCATION_ . the < > values reach an average plateau of in min s reflecting that the centromeres undergo diffusive movement in constrained areas within the _LOCATION_ with a mean change in distance between centromeres of and a diffusion coefficient of . a plot of < > for fixed seedlings indicates that the experimental noise in our microscope system is minimal . we then observed centromere movements in other cell types including leaf guard cells and sepal and _PROTEIN_ pavement cells . unlike cells in root tips growing on chambered coverglass these cell types are not compatible with long term imaging when mounted in water or _METHOD_ medium . however during an imaging period of up to min we found that centromeres in these cell types are also essentially stationary consistent with the results from root meristematic cells . the three dimensional positions of centromeres in the mother cell and the two daughter cells were investigated to ascertain whether global centromeric position is transmitted to daughter cells . to track centromere positions through mitosis we collected time lapse d image stacks of arabidopsis root meristematic cells . to minimize photo toxicity due to the excitation light we collect data using a short exposure time for each section . the cells were followed as they progressed through mitosis and the root growth rate at the beginning of imaging was similar to that at the end of imaging indicating that our imaging conditions were appropriate . during mitosis possibly due to anchoring of microtubules we observed much less rotation of centromeres than that in interphase _LOCATION_ making centromere tracking less complicated . we could unambiguously follow the movements of all the visible centromeres through mitosis in about half of the mitotic events observed . we analyzed nine complete in vivo mitotic events . figure shows a typical distribution of centromeres through mitosis in arabidopsis root meristemic cells . from prophase to metaphase upon breaking down of _LOCATION_ envelope each pair of sister centromeres rotated at a different angle gradually to become oriented perpendicular to the metaphase plate . centromere order perpendicular to the spindle axis was partially preserved along the metaphase plate . for example in the _PROTEIN_ mother cell the sequence of centromeres from top to bottom is whereas in metaphase the sequence is indicating some repositioning of chromosomes upon formation of the metaphase plate . in contrast the spatial information of centromeres along the spindle axis was totally lost upon superimposition of these sister centromeres to the metaphase plate . the movements of the same set of centromeres were followed until early _PROTEIN_ to locate where the paired sister centromeres resided after they were pulled apart . in early anaphase sister centromeres start to move toward opposite poles however movement is not synchronous because some move early _LOCATION_ and others move _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ . importantly the behavior of sister centromeres is not the same as shown in figure centromere moves first toward the left daughter _LOCATION_ whereas it moves _PROTEIN_ toward the right daughter _LOCATION_ centromere moves first toward the right daughter _LOCATION_ whereas it moves _PROTEIN_ toward the left daughter _LOCATION_ . although the lagging centromeres in early anaphase normally move to the proximal areas of the daughter _LOCATION_ and advancing centromeres move to distal parts of daughter _LOCATION_ lagging centromeres can move to the distal part of the daughter _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the advancing centromeres can move to proximal parts of the daughter _LOCATION_ . in _PROTEIN_ telophase and early _PROTEIN_ centromeres expand isometrically upon the enlargement of the _LOCATION_ envelope of daughter _LOCATION_ without changing their neighborhood . figure shows a cartoon of centromere localization in a mother cell _LOCATION_ and its two daughter _LOCATION_ in d _LOCATION_ . centromeres do not exhibit similar positioning between mother and daughter cells . for example in the mother _LOCATION_ centromeres and are on one side of the _LOCATION_ and centromeres and are at the opposite side along the spindle axis whereas in the _LOCATION_ of daughter cell these four centromeres are on the same side of the _LOCATION_ and in the _LOCATION_ of daughter cell centromeres and are on one side and centromeres and are on the opposite side . significant differences in d centromere distribution between mother and daughter cell _LOCATION_ and clear asymmetry between the two daughter cell _LOCATION_ are observed . we conclude that the organization of centromeres in arabidopsis _LOCATION_ is not passed down precisely from one cell to its descendents but instead it is more plastic .

sites . a kb genomic dna fragment of _PROTEIN_ downstream sequence was amplified using primers nnngcggccgcgtttagccgtttaggtttcga and _PROTEIN_ the fragment contains noti and ecori restriction sites .

agei and a noti restriction site . these pcr fragments were cloned into _PROTEIN_ vector confirmed by sequencing and then released by treatment with the respective restriction enzymes . _PROTEIN_ was directionally subcloned into the hindiii/ecori digested vector with the direction hindiii _PROTEIN_ upstream regulatory sequence _PROTEIN_ coding dna with introns agei ala linker venus _METHOD_ noti _PROTEIN_ terminator ecori to obtain binary vectors _PROTEIN_ venus and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ was directionally subcloned into the bamhi/ecori digested vector with the direction bamhi _PROTEIN_ upstream regulatory sequence _PROTEIN_ coding dna agei ala linker _METHOD_ noti _PROTEIN_ terminator ecori to obtain binary vector _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the vectors _PROTEIN_ venus _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were introduced into agrobacterium tumefaciens strain by electroporation . a. thaliana plants were transformed by the floral dip method . cotransformation was performed by mixing equal amounts of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ suspension before dipping . transgenic plant selection and growth conditions were described in fang et al . . selective agents used were mg/l glufosinate ammonium for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and mg/l kanamycin and mg/l glufosinate ammonium for cotransformants of _PROTEIN_ venus and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . transgenic lines carrying one copy of each transgene were used for imaging . _METHOD_ deconvolution microscopy and settings were performed as described in fang et al . . filters used for venus were excitation and emission nm for _METHOD_ and nm and for _METHOD_ and nm respectively and _METHOD_ . transgenic plants of _PROTEIN_ venus and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ cotransformants were used for imaging . rosette leaves sepal and _PROTEIN_ were cut and mounted in _METHOD_ medium between two mm no . coverslips and immediately used for imaging . the image stacks of _LOCATION_ were collected with a z step size of . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic seeds were used for d imaging . for imaging the root meristematic cells the transgenic seeds were sown onto chambered coverglass system the growing roots in _METHOD_ medium was used for imaging . time lapse d images up to h with a time point interval of s were collected in seven sections with a image size of pixels an exposure time of s for each section and a z step size of . deconvolution measurement of distances and volume rendering of the image stacks were performed using softworx software . the deltavision files were saved as tif images and processed using adobe photoshop _METHOD_ . deconvolved d stacks were rotated to an angle where the centromere of interest is closest to the _LOCATION_ periphery as observed in projection _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . centromere positions were then quantified similar to analyses of telomere position described in hediger et al . . to determine the position of the centromere of interest the centromere spot to periphery distance was divided by the _LOCATION_ radius . each centromere fell into one of three concentric spherical zones of equal surface . to exclude _LOCATION_ in measurement caused by z axis resolution and _LOCATION_ rotation we selected _LOCATION_ in which the two centromeres remained in the same z section an approach used previously in studies on budding yeast drosophila and human cells . the signal intensities of each pixel in deconvolved _LOCATION_ images were obtained in the data inspector module and the distances between centromeres were measured by standard two point method in softworx software . the position of a centromere was defined as the brightest pixel in the local _METHOD_ spot . the changes in distance between centromeres relative to t were calculated at each time point . the squared values were plotted against the elapsed time . standard normal deviates were calculated to assess the significance of the apparent differences between < > values . the diffusion coefficient was calculated from the linear slopes of < > plots with the formula d . as a control roots of transgenic seedlings were fixed in phosphate buffered saline containing formaldehyde prepared fresh from paraformaldehyde followed by washing and d microscopic visualization . cell and centromere tracking were performed using softworx software . selected cells were tracked by centering the cell in the image stacks to eliminate the effect of root growth on data analysis . image stacks containing the cell of interest were then cut time point by time point from the raw data and assembled into d images . after deconvolution centromeres were segmented and tracked in individual sections partial projection images and total maximum projection images . the same centromere in a section and the total maximum projection image at a given time point were defined by comparing the signal intensity and its x and y positions in pixel numbers . at least three identical results were obtained from independent centromere tracking processes for each mitotic event .
