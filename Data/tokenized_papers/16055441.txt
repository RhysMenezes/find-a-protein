the distribution of folates in plant cells suggests a complex traffic of the vitamin between the organelles and the _LOCATION_ . the arabidopsis thaliana protein _PROTEIN_ encoded by the _GENE_ gene is the closest homolog of the mitochondrial folate transporters _PROTEIN_ characterized in mammalian cells . _PROTEIN_ belongs to the mitochondrial carrier family but _METHOD_ tagging experiments and western blot analyses indicated that it is targeted to the envelope of chloroplasts . by using the glycine auxotroph chinese _METHOD_ ovary glyb cell line which lacks a functional _PROTEIN_ and is deficient in folates transport into mitochondria we showed by complementation that _PROTEIN_ functions as a folate transporter in a _METHOD_ background . indeed stable transfectants bearing the _PROTEIN_ cdna have enhanced levels of folates in mitochondria and can support growth in glycine free medium . also the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli allows bacterial cells to uptake exogenous folate . disruption of the _PROTEIN_ gene in arabidopsis does not lead to phenotypic alterations in folate sufficient or folate deficient plants . also the _PROTEIN_ null mutant contains wild type levels of folates in chloroplasts and preserves the enzymatic capacity to catalyze folate dependent reactions in this subcellular compartment . these findings suggest strongly that despite many common features shared by chloroplasts and mitochondria from mammals _PROTEIN_ folate metabolism the folate import _METHOD_ in these organelles are not equivalent folate uptake by mammalian mitochondria is mediated by a unique transporter whereas there are alternative routes for folate import into chloroplasts .
cloning of mammalian _PROTEIN_ homologs in searched the arabidopsis genome for genes encoding putative homologs of the human mitochondrial folate transporter and found that all the candidates were hypothetical members of the mitochondrial carrier family . in silico analysis of the complete arabidopsis genome has revealed members in this family of which only onefourth have been functionally characterized . among the best hits of our blastp search the product of the _GENE_ gene shared the highest sequence identity with the human and zebrafish _PROTEIN_ . the corresponding cdna _PROTEIN_ was cloned by pcr using reverse transcribed mrnas from the wassilewskija ecotype . sequence analysis revealed nine nucleotide changes between the _PROTEIN_ and _GENE_ cdna . among these changes only one leads to an altered amino acid at position _PROTEIN_ . it is unlikely that this point mutation affects the _PROTEIN_ function because the full length arabidopsis cdna sequenced by the ceres company also encodes for a pro at position a pro residue is present at the same position on the human and zebrafish _PROTEIN_ and this pro residue is included in one of the energy signature motifs characteristic of the mitochondrial carrier family in which it is involved in the three dimensional organization of the odd numbered transmembrane helices . the cdnas coding the _GENE_ and _GENE_ proteins which share identity with hsmft were also cloned by pcr . these cdnas showed two and one polymorphic sites respectively compared with the corresponding sequences deposited in the arabidopsis information resource data base . of these snp two resulted in silent substitutions for the _GENE_ cdna and one in a change from a leu to ser in the _GENE_ protein . _PROTEIN_ is a kda protein that exhibits a hydrophobic profile with six putative transmembrane domains a tripartite structure made up of related tandem domains of about residues in length and sequence motifs that are characteristic of the mitochondrial carrier family . sequence homology between _PROTEIN_ and hsmft extends throughout the entire proteins and several highly conserved blocks are preserved . they particularly correspond to the six putative transmembrane helices and the three domains located within pairs of odd and even numbered helices which are predicted to extrude into the _PROTEIN_ side of the _LOCATION_ . subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ all of the members of the plant mitochondrial carrier family are actually targeted to mitochondria because the _LOCATION_ envelope _LOCATION_ harbors several transporters of this family . analyses of the _PROTEIN_ sequence using different _METHOD_ failed to predict a subcellular location for this protein with a high probability . however the prediction results from the chlorop version program and the identification of _GENE_ during the in silico analysis of the arabidopsis genome using features typical for the chloroplast envelope integral _LOCATION_ proteins suggested that _PROTEIN_ is a chloroplastic protein . to analyze the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ we transfected arabidopsis protoplasts with a plasmid encoding a fusion between the full length _PROTEIN_ protein and _METHOD_ . protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ alone typically showed green _METHOD_ throughout the _LOCATION_ and nucleoplasm . in contrast _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ resulted in a punctuate pattern of green _METHOD_ that colocalized with the red _METHOD_ of chlorophyll and that was similar to the one observed for the cp _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ control . a thorough survey of protoplasts _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion never revealed a _METHOD_ pattern similar to the one detected for the mt _METHOD_ mitochondrial control thus excluding in vivo targeting of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to mitochondria . these data demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is efficiently targeted to chloroplasts even though it does not exhibit a canonical transit peptide sequence . in addition the green _METHOD_ of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion _METHOD_ to be brighter at the chloroplast periphery thus suggesting a localization in the chloroplast envelope . to confirm the subcellular location of _PROTEIN_ by an alternative approach we raised a polyclonal serum against a synthetic peptide and prepared subfractions from percoll purified arabidopsis leaf chloroplasts . previous proteomic studies indicated that percoll purified arabidopsis chloroplasts isolated using similar procedures contained minute amounts of protein contaminants from other subcellular compartments . the envelope _LOCATION_ and stromal protein subfractions were analyzed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and western blot to check for cross contaminations . as shown in fig . antibodies against the oxoglutarate/malate translocator gave a strong signal in the envelope fraction and only a very faint labeling in _LOCATION_ . probing the _LOCATION_ subfractions with antibodies against the major _LOCATION_ light harvesting complex proteins indicated that the envelope preparation contained no more than _LOCATION_ proteins . these data indicated that the chloroplast subfractions were poorly cross contaminated and thus suitable to analyze the localization of _PROTEIN_ by western blot . as shown in fig . a kda polypeptide was immunodetected in the envelope but not in the stroma or _LOCATION_ subfractions using the purified anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies . also when _LOCATION_ proteins from percoll purified arabidopsis mitochondria were analyzed using the _PROTEIN_ antibodies no polypeptide having the predicted molecular weight of _PROTEIN_ could be detected . together with the _METHOD_ tagging experiments shown in fig . these results clearly indicate that _PROTEIN_ is located in the envelope of chloroplasts . _PROTEIN_ can complement the auxotrophy demonstrated by _PROTEIN_ glyb a _PROTEIN_ derived cell line was previously characterized to be deficient in accumulation of folates in the mitochondria an effect that rendered these cells auxotrophic for glycine as a result of a strong restriction in serine hydroxymethyltransferase activity in mitochondria . recently it was shown that glyb cells contain a point mutation _PROTEIN_ within the open reading frame of a gene encoding a mitochondrial inner _LOCATION_ protein responsible for the transport of folates into the _PROTEIN_ of mitochondria . cdnas for the human mouse and zebrafish _PROTEIN_ were found to efficiently complement glyb cells indicating their function as folate mitochondrial transporters in a _METHOD_ background . to address whether _PROTEIN_ was able to confer mitochondrial folates transport we stably transfected pcdna _PROTEIN_ into glyb cells using a calcium phosphate mediated procedure . after days the cultures were placed under either single selection conditions containing medium supplemented with _PROTEIN_ for determining transfection efficiency or under double selection conditions containing glycine free medium supplemented with _PROTEIN_ . after days of selection colonies were fixed and stained . in several experiments transfection of the _PROTEIN_ cdna consistently allowed the formation of colonies in glycine free medium with a frequency of . this value is lower than the frequency seen with a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cdna for which transfection plates had nearly identical numbers of colonies under single or double selection . control transfections using did not result in colony formation under double selection . when cdnas encoding two other arabidopsis candidate folate transporters were used in transfection assays no colonies were formed under double selection lending credence to the specificity of the effect seen with _PROTEIN_ . to confirm the authenticity of this complementation colonies were picked from single selection plates and each colony was expanded in medium containing glycine . cells from each _METHOD_ culture were plated in replicate wells in media allowing single and double selection . of the cultures thus isolated under non selective conditions showed progressive growth in medium formulated without glycine growth was followed for two passages . interestingly some cultures consistently formed large colonies in glycine deficient medium when plated at low density others formed small colonies . this behavior recapitulated the large and small colonies observed under double selection conditions . we concluded that the arabidopsis chloroplastic protein _PROTEIN_ can complement the auxotrophy demonstrated by glyb cells albeit less efficiently than mitochondrial folate transporters of mammalian origin . _PROTEIN_ enhances levels of folates in the mitochondria of glyb of the clonally expanded pcdna _PROTEIN_ transfectants were selected to determine whether the _PROTEIN_ protein could circumvent the folates depletion in mitochondria . these two expanded colonies differed in growth rate with one forming exclusively large colonies from single cells and the other forming smaller colonies . cultures of both transfectant cell lines were incubated with folic acid for h and the cells were harvested and fractionated into various compartments . in each of three experiments the mitochondrial folate pool in cells was expanded fold relative to the folate content of glyb cells which corresponded to of the mitochondrial pool found in _PROTEIN_ cells . the mitochondrial folate content in which grew much slower than was consistently higher than that found in glyb cells but it was much lower than that found in . this difference suggested that the substantial variation in colony size seen in the _PROTEIN_ transfection plates may reflect changes in levels of _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ protein with concomitant differences in folates uptake into mitochondria . overall we concluded that the arabidopsis chloroplastic protein _PROTEIN_ can partially restore the mitochondrial folates pool in glyb cells if _PROTEIN_ at high enough levels . the level of folates found in the _LOCATION_ of cells was also noticeably higher than those found in either glyb or _PROTEIN_ cells . we concluded that _PROTEIN_ of the arabidopsis protein in _METHOD_ cells probably also affected _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ transport of folate thus suggesting some degree of incorrect targeting that is not unusual in heterologous _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ allows e. coli cells to mediate folic acid establish whether _PROTEIN_ can mediate folate transport in another physiological context we used e. coli as an alternative heterologous _PROTEIN_ system . many bacteria including e. coli are folate autotrophs and normally do not have the ability to import and utilize exogenous folates . thus when de novo thf synthesis is blocked by specific inhibitors such as the p aminobenzoate analogs sulfonamides bacterial growth can not be restored by the addition of folates in the culture medium . the cdna coding a truncated _PROTEIN_ protein without the short n terminal extension located before the first predicted transmembrane helix was cloned in and introduced in e. coli cells . transformants harboring ptrc _PROTEIN_ or the empty vector were tested for growth in liquid minimal medium containing asulam and with or without folic acid . as shown in fig . the inhibition of the dihydropteroate synthase activity by asulam fully impaired growth of the transformants in the presence of exogenous folic acid . in contrast the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ restored growth of the strain only when folic acid is present in the medium . when iptg was omitted from the selective medium the growth of cells harboring ptrc at _PROTEIN_ was delayed thus suggesting that growth kinetics depend on the _PROTEIN_ level of the recombinant protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to verify this hypothesis we analyzed by western blot the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in cells . as shown in fig . only e. coli cells bearing the ptrc _PROTEIN_ plasmid and cultured for several hours in the presence of iptg _PROTEIN_ a kda polypeptide detected with the purified anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies thus indicating that the recombinant protein accumulated upon trc promoter induction . these data indicate that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ allows e. coli cells to mediate folic acid uptake from the external medium . characterization of an arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ null investigate the function of _PROTEIN_ in planta we required a mutant that lacked a functional _PROTEIN_ allele and searched the indexed insertion mutant data base from the signal website . we found a knock out mutant _PROTEIN_ and obtained the corresponding segregating seeds from the arabidopsis biological resource center . homozygous plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were selected by pcr and sequence analysis of the junction fragments obtained with t dna and gene specific primers identified the t dna insertion in exon . the _PROTEIN_ t dna locus was verified by dna gel blot analysis using _PROTEIN_ and t dna probes . the observed patterns are consistent with pcr analysis and indicate that the homozygous plants do not contain any additional t dna insertions elsewhere in the genome . rt pcr analysis indicated that the _PROTEIN_ transcript was not _PROTEIN_ in homozygous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants . a survey of the _PROTEIN_ pattern of the _GENE_ gene using the arabidopsis microarray data base genevestigator indicated that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in all the examined organs and tissues at almost similar levels . also the use of the genevestigator gene chronologer toolbox and quantitative rt pcr analysis done with col plants grown in our greenhouse indicated that the _PROTEIN_ gene is _PROTEIN_ constitutively at all growth stages from germination to plant senescence . from these data we hypothesized that a phenotype could be detected for the _PROTEIN_ null mutant at any stage of plant development . thus the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ null mutants and the wild type col were cultured side by side under standard conditions and their growth characteristics were compared . throughout the examined growing period there were no significant differences between the mutant and wild type plants in _METHOD_ of germination efficiency growth rates morphology seed production and fertility . also measurements of photosynthesis and respiration rates in rosette leaves at different stages of development did not show significant changes in the mutant as compared with the wild type . to characterize further the phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutant we grew plants under conditions leading to a depletion of the cellular pool of folates . for this purpose plants were allowed to germinate and grow under defined nutrient conditions on agar medium supplemented with sulfanilamide or mtx two folate antagonists that were found to be useful in manipulating the availability of thf in plants . sulfanilamide is an inhibitor of dihydropteroate synthase whereas mtx blocks the reduction of dihydrofolate to thf catalyzed by dihydrofolate reductase . seeds were exposed to a range of concentrations of the drugs added separately and analyzed during a week period . the presence of one of these inhibitors in the medium resulted in a dose dependent growth retardation with more severe effects of mtx versus sulfanilamide as previously observed . under these conditions we could not observe any clear phenotypic difference between the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ mutant thus suggesting that the absence of _PROTEIN_ did not modify seedling sensitivity to the antifolate drugs . in another set of experiments seedlings were grown for days in a standard medium and then transferred to sulfanilamide or mtx containing medium . again the developmental consequences of folate depletion we observed were not significantly different for the wild type and mutant lines . to determine whether the absence of _PROTEIN_ affects the folate status of the null mutants we measured the pools of folates in leaves . as shown in fig . the folates levels in day old leaves was about nmol per gram of fresh weight and progressively _PROTEIN_ down to nmol g fresh weight in day old leaves . a similar behavior was found for the _PROTEIN_ null mutants and the values obtained at any stage of growth were not significantly different for the wild type and the mutants . chloroplastic folates have been shown to contribute to only of the cellular pool of the vitamin thus modest changes in folates levels in leaves could have been masked by experimental variations . to deal with this hypothesis we purified chloroplasts from day old leaves and measured their folates content . the wild type the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants contained and pmol folates per milligram of chloroplastic soluble proteins respectively . these results indicate that the absence of _PROTEIN_ reduced neither the chloroplastic nor the cellular pools of folates in arabidopsis leaves . to assess the effect of the _PROTEIN_ mutation on one _PROTEIN_ metabolism in chloroplasts we analyzed the _PROTEIN_ of two folate dependent enzymes present in this compartment . western blot analysis indicated that the chloroplastic folylpolyglutamate synthetase was detected at similar levels in the wild type and mutant plants . also both the _LOCATION_ and chloroplastic methionine synthase _METHOD_ are present in nearly similar amounts in both arabidopsis lines . taken together these data suggest that the _PROTEIN_ null mutant and the wild type have the same enzymatic capacity to catalyze both the glutamylation of thf and the methyl thf dependent synthesis of methionine in the chloroplasts . we have selected a second independent arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ null mutant in which the t dna insertion is located at the junction between intron and exon of the _PROTEIN_ gene . plants homozygous for the mutation failed to accumulate the _PROTEIN_ mrna had no discernable phenotype when grown under folate sufficient conditions and contained wild type levels of folates in leaves . these results are consistent with the data presented for the _PROTEIN_ knock out line .
