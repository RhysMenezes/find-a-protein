light is one of the most important environmental _PROTEIN_ that determine the timing of a plant 's transition from the vegetative to reproductive or flowering phase . not only daylength but also the spectrum of light greatly affect flowering . the shade of nearby vegetation reduces the ratio of red to far red light and can trigger shade avoidance responses including stem elongation and the acceleration of flowering . phytochrome b _PROTEIN_ acts as a photoreceptor for this response . physiological studies have suggested that leaves can perceive and respond to shade . however little is known about the _METHOD_ involved in the processing of light signals within leaves . in this study we used an enhancer trap system to establish arabidopsis thaliana transgenic lines that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion protein in tissue specific manners . the analysis of these lines demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in mesophyll cells affected flowering whereas _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in vascular bundles did not . furthermore mesophyll _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ suppressed the _PROTEIN_ of a key flowering regulator flowering locus t in the vascular bundles of cotyledons . hence a novel intertissue signaling from mesophyll to vascular bundles is revealed as a critical step for the regulation of flowering by _PROTEIN_ .
to examine tissue specific functions of _PROTEIN_ we _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein using a camv minimal promoter based enhancer trap system . we constructed a vector containing the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion gene and the camv minimal promoter which is thought to be _PROTEIN_ only when it is inserted near cis acting chromosomal enhancers . the vector was transformed into the _PROTEIN_ mutant of arabidopsis by the agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated method and independent _PROTEIN_ lines were established . we first examined _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in light grown seedlings under a conventional _METHOD_ microscope . _METHOD_ was observed in of the _PROTEIN_ lines . characteristic _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ speckles were observed in the _LOCATION_ of these lines . the spatial patterns of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ are summarized in table . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ patterns in _PROTEIN_ lines as controls lines that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the control of the authentic _PROTEIN_ promoter referred to as bpro lines were established . the _PROTEIN_ mutant was transformed with a vector carrying the authentic _PROTEIN_ promoter and the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ gene . we obtained more than bpro lines that exhibited normal flowering under white light . observations of the light grown bpro seedlings under a conventional _METHOD_ microscope revealed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in all organs and tissues including vascular bundles stomata and trichomes . the overall patterns were consistent with those reported for the _PROTEIN_ promoter gus fusion gene _PROTEIN_ . on the basis of the immunoblotting analysis we chose as a representative of bpro lines . we examined the flowering phenotype of the _METHOD_ positive _PROTEIN_ lines under continuous white light . under these conditions the _PROTEIN_ mutant which was used as the host plant for the transformation clearly exhibited the early flowering phenotype . among these _PROTEIN_ lines lines exhibited normal flowering time . these included the lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in almost all organs in cotyledons and other organs and in cotyledons . the patterns in the other lines that flowered as early as the _PROTEIN_ mutant were as follows five root specific lines two vascular bundle specific lines two leaf primordia specific lines six trichrome specific lines and three stomata specific lines . to confirm that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was properly monitored _PROTEIN_ lines that were negative for the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were chosen at random and subjected to the flowering time analysis . as expected all the _PROTEIN_ lines flowered early . thus evidence suggests that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in cotyledons is crucial in the regulation of flowering . interestingly all of the lines that exhibited normal flowering time appeared normal with respect to seedling and rosette leaf morphology . by contrast all of the noncomplemented lines were indistinguishable from the _PROTEIN_ mutant . hence _PROTEIN_ in cotyledons appears to be important not only for flowering time regulation but also for seedling and rosette leaf morphogenesis . initial analysis of _PROTEIN_ lines suggests that cotyledons are the photoreceptive sites for the regulation of flowering by _PROTEIN_ . to further confirm this and to examine the signal transduction processes within cotyledons we chose representative lines and analyzed them in more detail . these lines were as follows _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as cotyledon specific lines _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as vascular bundle lines and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as root specific lines . in agreement with previous reports flowering was accelerated in _PROTEIN_ mutants under continuous long day and short day light treatments . as expected lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in cotyledons _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ flowered as _PROTEIN_ as the wild type whereas the others _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ flowered early . in parallel complementation of long hypocotyl and small cotyledon phenotypes was observed in the normal flowering lines . we observed the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in more detail under a laser scanning confocal microscope . in the mesophyll cells of cotyledons the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ speckles were detected in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but not in other lines . by contrast _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the vascular bundles of the cotyledon was observed only in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . we then examined these lines to determine whether _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ in other parts of the seedlings . in the shoot apex only _PROTEIN_ a significant level of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in the hypocotyl the _PROTEIN_ was observed in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . it should be noted that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was restricted to the vascular bundles in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was observed in roots in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . again the _PROTEIN_ was restricted to the vascular bundles in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . these observations indicate that flowering is delayed in the presence of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in mesophyll cells to a greater extent than it is when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is present in vascular bundles . in addition to mesophyll _PROTEIN_ a low but detectable level of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was observed in the epidermis in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . thus it is possible that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the epidermis regulates flowering . to examine this possibility an additional line _PROTEIN_ in which _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ under the control of the camv promoter was employed . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ in specific parts of the seedlings in the _PROTEIN_ which is probably a result of the positional effect . confocal microscopic observations revealed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ epidermal _PROTEIN_ was significantly higher in _PROTEIN_ than in _PROTEIN_ although a higher level of _PROTEIN_ was observed for _PROTEIN_ . nevertheless flowering time was normal in _PROTEIN_ yet early in _PROTEIN_ . hence we concluded that the effect of _PROTEIN_ on flowering is much more significant when it is _PROTEIN_ in the mesophyll than it is when present in the epidermis . to confirm the observed _PROTEIN_ patterns and to estimate the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ lines seedlings were separated into four parts cotyledons shoot apex hypocotyls and roots and subjected to immunoblotting analysis . a band of predicted size was detected with anti _PROTEIN_ antibody in all lines . as expected the levels of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulated in the seedlings were comparable to those in the wild type seedlings demonstrating that seedlings accumulated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at normal levels . consistent with our microscopic observations _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein was detected in cotyledons but not in other plant parts in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines . by contrast _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was detected only in the roots in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in the vascular bundle lines _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ low levels of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were detected in cotyledons hypocotyls and roots . it has been proposed that _PROTEIN_ has an effect on flowering by regulating gene _PROTEIN_ of a key regulator _PROTEIN_ in response to shade . accordingly _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is increased in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . to further verify that _PROTEIN_ is involved in the regulation of flowering by _PROTEIN_ we established a _PROTEIN_ ft double mutant and examined its flowering time under continuous white light . in agreement with the above research findings the early flowering phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutant was greatly suppressed by the ft mutation . in continuous white light the gene a marker for floral determination is _PROTEIN_ in shoot apical _METHOD_ by day . hence we examined _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by rt pcr during the first week of seedling development in the wild type the _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ under continuous light . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was increased continuously until day . throughout the experimental period _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was lower in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the wild type than it was in _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ mutant . hence _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ effectively delayed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ when it was _PROTEIN_ in the mesophyll _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but not when it was _PROTEIN_ in vascular bundles _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ gene is _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in leaves but not in the shoot apex or the stem . to examine organ specific regulation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis seedlings were grown for d under continuous white light and then separated into cotyledons shoot apex and the remainder of the plant and analyzed by rt pcr . as expected _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was much higher in cotyledons than in other plant parts . furthermore _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was suppressed in cotyledons by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . a similar pattern of suppression was observed in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but not in _PROTEIN_ . hence we concluded that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in mesophyll cells regulated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in cotyledons in a manner similar to that of endogenous _PROTEIN_ . to examine _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ at the tissue level we isolated mesophyll protoplasts and vascular bundles from cotyledons . mesophyll protoplasts were prepared according to citation . the purity of mesophyll protoplasts was estimated to be > by microscopic observation . to isolate vascular bundles cotyledons were dipped into cell wall digesting enzyme solution and sonicated gently several times . most of the mesophyll and epidermal cells were broken whereas vascular bundles remained intact for the large part because of their hardness . little mesophyll cell contamination was observed in the preparations . the _PROTEIN_ of marker genes rbcs for mesophyll cells and sultr for vascular bundles was examined to further confirm that the separation of the tissues was efficient . the _PROTEIN_ of rbcs in mesophyll protoplasts was approximately four times higher than that in the vascular bundle samples . conversely the sultr _PROTEIN_ in the vascular bundle sample was much higher than in the mesophyll protoplasts . we examined the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mrna in the same samples to confirm the tissue specific _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . consistent with the confocal microscopic observations mesophyllic _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and vascular bundle _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ were comparable to those in whereas vascular bundle _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and mesophyllic _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ were low . the _PROTEIN_ gene is _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in vascular bundles but much less in the mesophyll in wild type seedlings . nevertheless _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in mesophyll was much more effective in suppressing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in cotyledons than that in vascular bundles . hence we examined whether the mesophyllic _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ indeed suppressed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in vascular bundles . mesophyll protoplasts and vascular bundles were prepared from the cotyledons of the seedlings grown under continuous white light for d followed by rt pcr analyses . consistent with a previous promoter analysis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was higher in vascular bundles than it was in mesophyll cells in wild type seedlings . the _PROTEIN_ was higher compared with the wild type in vascular bundles but not in the mesophyll in the _PROTEIN_ mutant indicating that the endogenous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ suppresses _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in vascular bundles . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the vascular bundles was suppressed in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in which _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ in the mesophyll but not in the vascular bundles compared with the _PROTEIN_ mutant . by contrast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in vascular bundles was as high in the parental _PROTEIN_ mutant as it was in the vascular bundles of _PROTEIN_ . hence _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in mesophyll cells suppressed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in vascular bundles whereas _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the vascular bundles did not .
