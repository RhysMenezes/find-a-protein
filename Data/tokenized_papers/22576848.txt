previously a dysfunction of the small acidic _PROTEIN_ gene was identified as the cause of the anti auxin mutant of arabidopsis . _PROTEIN_ is involved in the response pathway of synthetic auxin dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and functions upstream of the auxin/indole acetic acid protein degradation step in auxin signaling . however the exact mechanism by which _PROTEIN_ functions in auxin signaling remains unknown . here we demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is required for normal plant growth and development and the root response to indole acetic acid or methyl jasmonate in the auxin _PROTEIN_ mutation background . deletion analysis and green _METHOD_ protein/glutathione s transferase pull down assays showed that _PROTEIN_ physically interacts with the _PROTEIN_ signalosome via the _PROTEIN_ f/d region . the extremely dwarf phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ double mutant _METHOD_ the functional role of _PROTEIN_ in plant growth and development under limiting csn functionality . our findings suggest that _PROTEIN_ is involved in the auxin response and possibly in other cullin _PROTEIN_ ubiquitin ligase regulated signaling processes via its interaction with components associated with related to ubiquitin modification .
to investigate the relationship between and other known auxin mutants we crossed the mutant with various mutants in the auxin signaling pathway _PROTEIN_ a mutant of an auxin receptor _PROTEIN_ a mutant of a subunit of the rub activating enzyme _PROTEIN_ a mutant of another subunit of the rub activating enzyme and _PROTEIN_ a mutant of a like gene . then we attempted to establish double mutants . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ double mutants were successfully obtained . however the _PROTEIN_ mutant showed severe morphological defects nearly one quarter of the offspring from the _PROTEIN_ parents did not germinate or died at the early seedling stage without developing roots . genotyping with pcr markers confirmed that the rootless siblings were _PROTEIN_ double mutants . in normal embryos the hypophysis divides asymmetrically and _METHOD_ a quiescent center in the root meristem . formation of an auxin gradient is required for this process which can be readily visualized by the authentic auxin reporter _METHOD_ . however in the abnormal embryos neither the formation of a quiescent center nor _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was observed at the position where descendants of hypophyseal cells should be located suggesting that _PROTEIN_ lacks normal auxin response . the _PROTEIN_ double mutant also showed severe morphological defects in the aerial parts . for example venation was poorly developed compared with that in _PROTEIN_ suggesting that the effect of the mutation is substantial in the _PROTEIN_ background . similar abnormal seedlings or ungerminated seeds were observed in the descendants of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ parental lines suggesting that the abnormal phenotype in double mutants is not allele dependent . the mutation has an approximately kb deletion in chromosome this deleted region contains at least open reading frames including _PROTEIN_ . therefore the abnormal phenotype could be caused by the lack of other genes rather than _PROTEIN_ . to eliminate this possibility we crossed _PROTEIN_ with two independent transgenic lines harboring a kp bamhi/saci genomic dna fragment containing the _PROTEIN_ open reading frame . as shown in figures and g to i the seedling population _PROTEIN_ lines showed no rootless offspring in contrast to the line harboring the control genomic fragment . in reverse the homozygous offspring of the _PROTEIN_ heterozygous parental lines harboring the _PROTEIN_ rna interference construct were rootless . taken together these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is necessary for root meristem formation and normal embryo development in the _PROTEIN_ background . we successfully obtained the double mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . most of these double mutants did not show any severe morphological defects compared with their parental lines . however approximately of seedlings from the _PROTEIN_ parent showed a rootless phenotype similar to that of the _PROTEIN_ double mutants . the root elongation assay against d revealed that the double mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are more resistant compared with their corresponding single mutants suggesting an additive relationship between the mutation and the auxin related mutations _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for regulating the root auxin response . _PROTEIN_ was fused to _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in plants . the _PROTEIN_ of fusion proteins in the transgenic lines restored wild type sensitivity to pcib and d in the roots suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins are functionally active . the mature _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic arabidopsis plants were morphologically indistinguishable from nontransgenic plants in either the wild type or background . when _METHOD_ was introduced into the _PROTEIN_ background _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ morphological phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ such as dwarfism reduced apical dominance protruding pistils and low fertility were partially alleviated . in a root growth assay the _PROTEIN_ mutant is strongly resistant to auxin and other plant hormones such as jasmonic acid . the introduction of _METHOD_ also partially restored the d sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ roots . furthermore although the mutant is reported to be a d specific response mutant the sensitivity of _METHOD_ to iaa and methyl jasmonate was intermediate between that of the wild type and _PROTEIN_ suggesting that in the absence of functional _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ function is required for normal iaa and ja responses . unexpectedly unlike the _PROTEIN_ genomic fragment _METHOD_ fusion constructs _PROTEIN_ under the control of the camv promoter did not effectively recover the rootless phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ double mutant . although we established homozygous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ lines by crossing many seeds from these lines did not germinate and most of those that did germinate were rootless . this may be due to the low _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at the early stage of embryo development which could not complement the loss of the _PROTEIN_ gene from hypophyseal initial cells . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was hardly detected in the globular embryos of the two _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines . the transgene of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ that was strongly _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the lower part of the globular embryo effectively rescued the morphological defects in the _PROTEIN_ double mutants . another independent line of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ that showed low level _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the globular embryo did not recover the root development in _PROTEIN_ double mutant background . this suggests that strong _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the globular stage embryo is required to establish root initial organization in the _PROTEIN_ background . to investigate the functional aspects of the _PROTEIN_ protein we constructed several versions of _PROTEIN_ derivatives including those with deleted versions of the conserved f/d region fused to _METHOD_ under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter . these constructs were transformed into the mutant and their ability to complement the mutation was investigated . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of the fusion proteins was detected in both _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ . the mutant is resistant to the anti auxin pcib and the synthetic auxin d and exhibits long hypocotyl when grown in the light . as shown in figure b to d independent transgenic lines harboring _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the background recovered sensitivities to pcib and d and showed similar hypocotyl length to that of the wild type suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein is functional . the construct _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which contained a deleted version of the f/d rich region did not complement the mutation although the fusion protein was _PROTEIN_ in the transgenic lines as confirmed by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . this finding implies that the f/d region is necessary for _PROTEIN_ function . the n terminal deletion construct in which one third of the n terminal amino acids were deleted was still able to complement the phenotype . however the and _PROTEIN_ constructs which consisted of and c terminal amino acids respectively did not complement the phenotype suggesting that the f/d rich region alone is not sufficient for _PROTEIN_ function . using the transgenic plants described above we next attempted to identify _PROTEIN_ interacting proteins in arabidopsis extracts . total proteins were extracted from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ lines using a nondenaturing extraction buffer and subjected to pull down assays using anti _METHOD_ microbeads . the purified _METHOD_ and/or _PROTEIN_ binding proteins were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and subjected to silver staining and western blotting with an anti _METHOD_ antibody . silver staining revealed that seven distinct bands are present in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ extract but absent in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ extract suggesting that the proteins present in these bands are possibly _PROTEIN_ interacting proteins . these proteins were digested by trypsin eluted from the gel and analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . a mascot database search of the resulting _METHOD_ spectra identified the proteins as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ glyceraldehyde phosphate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . of all the identified proteins six out of seven were subunits of the large csn complex that typically consists of eight subunits . taken together these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ physically interacts with csn in arabidopsis extracts and that this interaction requires the presence of the f/d region . to further elucidate the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and csn we established an in vitro binding assay with glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ tagged fusion proteins _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli . the _PROTEIN_ tagged _PROTEIN_ protein and its derivatives _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ extracted from e. coli were immobilized to glutathione columns . total proteins extracted from the arabidopsis mutant were added to these columns . candidate interacting proteins as well as the _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins _METHOD_ were eluted from the columns by _PROTEIN_ sample buffer separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and subjected to _METHOD_ blue staining and western blot analysis with an anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . the results showed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ f/d but not _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ pulled down _PROTEIN_ protein from the extracts suggesting that the f/d region of _PROTEIN_ is necessary and sufficient for the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and csn . csn was originally identified through the biochemical characterization of the _PROTEIN_ protein complex which plays a significant role in regulating photomorphogenesis and postembryo development in arabidopsis . furthermore auxin responses are partially impaired in csn mutants . to investigate the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and csn at the genetic level we crossed the mutant with the weak csn mutant _PROTEIN_ and established a line harboring homozygous and heterozygous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in the seedling population from the _PROTEIN_ parental line both in light and dark grown conditions we observed distinct segregation of dwarf seedlings readily distinguishable from either or _PROTEIN_ seedlings . genotyping analyses confirmed that these dwarf plants are the _PROTEIN_ double mutant . the longer hypocotyl phenotype of was suppressed by the _PROTEIN_ mutation . in _PROTEIN_ the double mutant showed an extreme short hypocotyl phenotype . similarly a slower root growth phenotype was found in the double mutant although the growth of the roots of and _PROTEIN_ is comparable to the wild type . in addition the double mutant showed d resistance for root growth like its parental lines . the _PROTEIN_ plants at the rosette stage also showed an extremely small seedling phenotype and most of the plants died before producing seeds . when the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ gene was introduced into the _PROTEIN_ background _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ by crossing normal hypocotyl length was restored suggesting that the lack of the _PROTEIN_ gene is associated with the extreme dwarf hypocotyl phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ double mutant . when the seedlings were transferred from agar plates and further grown on soil the morphology of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plant was intermediate between that of the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ mutant suggesting that the ectopic _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene not only complemented the phenotype but also partially compensated the morphological abnormalities of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . taken together these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is required for the normal development of seedlings under limiting csn activity . the results from two independent experimental approaches implied that _PROTEIN_ interacts with the rub modification related _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and csn . thus we next examined the rub modification status of the _PROTEIN_ protein which is a core subunit of scf ligase and one of the most characterized rub modified proteins in the double mutants and transgenic lines by western blotting using anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . as previously published the ratio of rub modified and unmodified _PROTEIN_ is lower in _PROTEIN_ and higher in _PROTEIN_ compared with that in the wild type . no significant difference was observed in rub modification depending on the presence or absence of the _PROTEIN_ gene except that a slight increase in rub modified _PROTEIN_ ratio was detected in the flower extracts of transgenics harboring _METHOD_ in the _PROTEIN_ background .
