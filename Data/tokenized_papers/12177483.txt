acyl coenzyme a synthetases _PROTEIN_ catalyze the formation of fatty acyl coas from free fatty acid _PROTEIN_ and coa . essentially all de novo fatty acid synthesis occurs in the _LOCATION_ . fatty acids destined for _LOCATION_ glycerolipid and triacylglycerol synthesis in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ must be first activated to acyl coas via an _PROTEIN_ . within a family of nine _PROTEIN_ genes from arabidopsis we identified a chloroplast isoform _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is highly _PROTEIN_ in developing seeds and young rosette leaves . both in vitro chloroplast import assays and transient _PROTEIN_ of a green _METHOD_ protein fusion indicated that the _PROTEIN_ protein is localized in the _LOCATION_ envelope . a t dna knockout mutant _PROTEIN_ was identified by reverse genetics and these mutant plants were indistinguishable from wild type in growth and appearance . analysis of leaf lipids provided no evidence for compromised export of acyl groups from chloroplasts . however direct assays demonstrated plants contained only of the chloroplast long chain _PROTEIN_ activity found for wild type . the residual long chain _PROTEIN_ activity in mutant chloroplasts was comparable with calculated rates of fatty acid synthesis . although another isozyme contributes to the activation of fatty acids during their export from the chloroplast _PROTEIN_ is a major chloroplast _PROTEIN_ .
the isolation and cloning of nine arabidopsis lacsgenes are described in a companion paper .citation used complementation in a yeast mutant as well as assays of recombinant enzymes to establish the cloned lacss as functional _PROTEIN_ enzymes . among these nine we were interested in identifying a _LOCATION_ lacs isoform because it is required for acyl lipid synthesis in all tissues of the plant . previous biochemical studies localized _LOCATION_ lacs activity in the chloroplast outer envelope . among other chloroplastic outer envelope proteins studied most are not synthesized as higher m r precursors and therefore do not contain a typical n terminal transit peptide . for this reason we did not expect to identify a _LOCATION_ lacs isoform based on sequence analysis alone . computer software _METHOD_ including psort and chlorop were unsuccessful at identifying _LOCATION_ lacs _METHOD_ . as an alternative approach to identifying a potential _LOCATION_ localized lacs we analyzed rna _PROTEIN_ patterns to identify candidates with transcripts abundant in tissues active in de novo fatty acid synthesis . we reasoned that a _LOCATION_ lacs involved in the export of newly synthesized fatty acids for _LOCATION_ and tag synthesis would be _PROTEIN_ predominantly in young leaves and developing seeds . initial rna gel blot analysis with gene specific probes for the ninelacs _METHOD_ indicated that _PROTEIN_ patterns varied greatly among the tissues tested . the transcript of one isoform _PROTEIN_ was highly _PROTEIN_ in both siliques and young leaves . the results of the _PROTEIN_ northern are shown in figure . the tissues represented include flowers and buds developing siliques young leaves older leaves and roots . the _PROTEIN_ probe hybridized to rna from flowers and buds and was more abundant in developing siliques . siliques corresponding to through and through _PROTEIN_ contained the highest levels of _PROTEIN_ transcript of all tissues examined . _PROTEIN_ transcript was not detectable in mature seed and was present at low levels in older siliques _PROTEIN_ leaves from older plants and roots . although present to a lesser extent than in young developing siliques _PROTEIN_ accumulated to modest levels in young leaves from and d old plants . these results are consistent with an _PROTEIN_ pattern we expect of a _LOCATION_ lacs involved in de novo fatty acid synthesis . to further investigate the possibility that _PROTEIN_ was a _LOCATION_ isoform we performed in vitro chloroplast import assays that provided a rapid and simple way to assess the association of _PROTEIN_ with chloroplast _LOCATION_ . our assay included the small subunit _PROTEIN_ of rubisco a hydroperoxide lyase and _PROTEIN_ . radiolabeled protein precursors were synthesized in vitro and incubated with intact pea chloroplasts . _LOCATION_ from the chloroplasts were then repurified to remove excess precursor proteins and lysed in hypotonic buffer . the lysed chloroplasts were collected by centrifugation . samples of the _LOCATION_ fraction were washed in chaotropic buffers to determine the strength of the association with _LOCATION_ . supernatant fractions were also recovered . figure summarizes the results of the import assays . the rubisco _PROTEIN_ is targeted to the stroma of the chloroplast by a transit peptide that is cleaved after import . figure shows that labeled _PROTEIN_ was targeted to the chloroplasts and processed to its mature form and was present in the soluble fraction after all treatments . lehpl a hydroperoxide lyase from tomato has been shown to associate with the chloroplast outer envelope despite the lack of a typical transit peptide . in figure lehpl associated with chloroplast _LOCATION_ . treatment of the _LOCATION_ with lysis buffer or nacl did not extract lehpl . only extraction with began to dissociate lehpl from the _LOCATION_ suggesting it is strongly associated with the _LOCATION_ as reported . _PROTEIN_ was also targeted to intact chloroplasts and was present only in the _LOCATION_ fractions . like lehpl the lysis buffer and nacl treatments did not dissociate _PROTEIN_ from the _LOCATION_ fraction of lysed chloroplasts whereas sodium _PROTEIN_ extracted a portion of _PROTEIN_ from chloroplast _LOCATION_ . from these results we conclude that _PROTEIN_ is strongly associated with chloroplast _LOCATION_ . in addition _PROTEIN_ does not appear to be proteolytically processed during _LOCATION_ targeting because the gel mobility of chloroplast associated _PROTEIN_ was identical to that of the in vitro translated product . the absence of processing is consistent with localization at the chloroplast envelope as opposed to localization in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to provide further evidence that _PROTEIN_ is localized in the _LOCATION_ envelope we analyzed the transient _PROTEIN_ of a _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion in onion epidermal cells . _METHOD_ construct was simultaneously bombarded with a _LOCATION_ marker control vector containing an _PROTEIN_ dsredfusion . _PROTEIN_ is a soluble protein found in the _LOCATION_ stroma . as shown in figure _METHOD_ from the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion was strongly associated with the outer surface of organelles that the _PROTEIN_ dsred _METHOD_ confirmed as _LOCATION_ . outgrowths from these _LOCATION_ are probably stromules and these also contained _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the patterns of _METHOD_ shown in figure indicate that _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ envelope protein . to ascertain the contribution of _PROTEIN_ to normal plant growth and development we initiated a search for an arabidopsis t dna knockout mutant . a search of the t dna tagged populations available through the arabidopsis biological resource center _PROTEIN_ was performed using a pcr based screen with primers designed to either the or portions of _PROTEIN_ in combination with t dna border primers . we generated a pcr band consistent with the presence of a t dna interrupting the _PROTEIN_ coding region . sequence analysis of the pcr product generated by using the t dna left border primer and gene specific primer combination revealed the presence of a plant line containing a t dna insertional event in the third exon of _PROTEIN_ . the sequence also showed that bp of the t dna left border was truncated upon insertion . other details on the nature of the insertional event were not investigated . seed pool _PROTEIN_ contained the plant with the t dna insertion and this pool represented seed from individual transformants . to identify mutant _PROTEIN_ individuals seed from pool was surface sterilized and plated on germination medium containing kanamycin . after d kanamycin resistant individuals were transferred to soil . genomic dna was isolated from pools containing eight plants each . the primer combination identified two pools with a _PROTEIN_ mutant . genomic dna was then isolated from the individual plants . to differentiate heterozygous from homozygous mutants two pcr reactions were performed for each plant . first primers were used to screen for the wild type _PROTEIN_ allele . next the primers were used to identify the presence of the mutant allele . from the plants we isolated one plant homozygous for a t dna insertion and one plant heterozygous at this locus . seeds from the heterozygous plant were germinated on kanamycin plates to investigate the number of t dna insertional events . of seeds were kanamycin sensitive which is a good fit to the hypothesis for a single insertion . to determine if the _PROTEIN_ mutant had altered levels of _PROTEIN_ transcript in response to a t dna insertion in the open reading frame total rna was isolated from tissues of wild type heterozygous and homozygous mutants and used for northern analysis . wild type plants _PROTEIN_ full length _PROTEIN_ transcript . the heterozygous mutants also _PROTEIN_ this full length _PROTEIN_ . both the heterozygous and homozygous plants contained a low level of a smaller m r rna that hybridized to the _PROTEIN_ probe . this transcript is equal in size to a truncated _PROTEIN_ transcript predicted to be produced by premature termination of _PROTEIN_ transcription at or near the site of the t dna insertion . it can be inferred that any protein translated from this mutant transcript would not be functional because both the putative amp /atp binding domain and the proposed fatty acid substrate binding pocket are located downstream of the insertion . based on this analysis it is very likely that line is a null for _PROTEIN_ activity . the _PROTEIN_ mutant was indistinguishable from wild type controls in size and appearance when grown under normal culture conditions . to test for quantitative differences in plant growth we grew wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants at under a photoperiod . changes in rosette fresh weight were measured by harvesting and weighing plants between and d after sowing . figure shows the resultant growth curve of wild type versus _PROTEIN_ plants . the relative growth rate of _PROTEIN_ was not significantly different from that of the wild type . the lack of variation in quantitative measurements of growth rate correlates with the observation that there were no outward phenotypic differences between wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants . similar results were obtained when the plants were grown under photoperiod . in addition no visible alterations in cellular ultrastructure or leaf anatomy were observed using transmission and scanning electron microscopy on leaves from to d old plants . the prokaryotic and eukaryotic pathways of lipid synthesis contribute almost equally to chloroplast _LOCATION_ lipid production in arabidopsis . the balance of fluxes through these pathways may be altered to alleviate a block in one of the pathways . for example the _PROTEIN_ mutant defective in the _LOCATION_ oleoyl phosphatidylcholine desaturase exhibits a _PROTEIN_ flux through the eukaryotic pathway and a compensating increase in chloroplast lipid synthesis by the prokaryotic pathway . in principle a _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ fatty acid export resulting from the _PROTEIN_ mutation might be ameliorated by reduced flux of lipid from the _LOCATION_ back to the chloroplast on the eukaryotic pathway and a corresponding increase in chloroplast lipid synthesis via the prokaryotic pathway . such a shift in fluxes through the two pathways is predicted to increase the levels of in monogalactosyl diacylglycerol and in the overall leaf fatty acid profile . both of these predicted changes were observed in _PROTEIN_ plants . we extracted leaf lipids from wild type plants and analyzed the fatty acid compositions of individual lipids separated by thin layer chromatography . there was no significant difference between wild type and mutant in the proportion of in total leaf extracts or in purified monogalactosyl diacylglycerol nor did we discern any other changes that could be interpreted in _METHOD_ of reduced transfer of acyl groups between the chloroplast and _LOCATION_ . because northern analysis showed that the _PROTEIN_ transcript was more abundant in developing siliques than young leaves we monitored the accumulation of fatty acids in developing siliques . significant changes in the amount of fatty acid methyl esters were not observed in developing siliques from wild type . in addition to very similar patterns of lipid accumulation mutant and wild type seeds were indistinguishable in size and appearance . furthermore the fresh weight and total fames present in mature seed was not significantly different between wild type . the absence of any detectable phenotype in the _PROTEIN_ and the expectation that a defect in a major chloroplast lacs would result in a pronounced phenotype raised the possibility that _PROTEIN_ is a minor lacs isozyme with minimal contribution to overall chloroplast lacs activity . however the relative abundance transcript and our demonstration that _PROTEIN_ is an active lacs argue against such a conclusion . to directly measure the contribution of the _PROTEIN_ isoform to chloroplast lacs activity we performed in vitro lacs assays on chloroplasts isolated from leaves of d old wild type and _PROTEIN_ . isolated chloroplasts were first assayed for lacs activity in hypotonic media using or as a substrate . control assays lacking coa or in which boiled chloroplasts were used demonstrated negligible activity . shows that the lacs activity of wild type chloroplasts averaged nmol fatty acyl coa chlorophyll . in contrast lacs activity of _PROTEIN_ chloroplasts averaged nmol chl or of the wild type activity . similar results were obtained when the assay was performed in osmotic buffer to prevent chloroplast lysis . this result is consistent with the chloroplast lacs being localized in the envelope with access to fatty acid substrates available in the external medium . taken together these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is a major contributor to chloroplastic lacs activity .
