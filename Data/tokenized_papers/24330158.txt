proteins detrimental to _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ morphology need to be efficiently exported . here we identify two _METHOD_ that control trafficking of arabidopsis a kda gdsl like lipase implicated in _PROTEIN_ metabolism through its association with the _PROTEIN_ myrosinase . using _METHOD_ we identified two mutants that showed aberrant accumulation of large perinuclear _LOCATION_ aggregates in the _LOCATION_ cage mutant and small compartments contiguous with the peripheral _LOCATION_ in the cytoplasmic bodies mutant . live imaging of _METHOD_ tagged confirmed its presence in the nuc and cyb compartments but lack of _METHOD_ signals in the wild type plants suggested that is normally post translationally modified for _LOCATION_ export . _PROTEIN_ encodes the _PROTEIN_ myrosinase associated protein previously shown to have _LOCATION_ distribution . cyb is an _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ localized type i _LOCATION_ protein component of coat protein complex _PROTEIN_ vesicles animal and yeast homologues of which are known to be involved in selective cargo sorting for _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ export . without _PROTEIN_ accumulates in the _LOCATION_ this situation suggests that _PROTEIN_ is in _PROTEIN_ active in the _LOCATION_ . without cyb both and _PROTEIN_ were found to accumulate in cyb compartments consistent with a role for _PROTEIN_ in processing and indicated that is the likely sorting target of the cyb protein .
the _LOCATION_ cage and cytoplasmic bodies mutants were identified in an _METHOD_ based screen that identified mutants with altered microtubule organization in an _METHOD_ mutagenized population of a. thaliana . the nuc mutants had large perinuclear structures whereas cyb mutants contained small spindle shaped cytoplasmic structures . both structures were highly antigenic to the tyrosinated tubulin specific tub antibody utilized in the mutant screen . microtubules were of normal appearance in the mutant cells . the nuc and cyb structures were detected only during early plant development in the epidermal cells of cotyledons and hypocotyls with a smaller number in the epidermal cells of the first leaf and in roots . these observations indicated that the nuc and cyb mutations affect a common process . mutant plants had a healthy appearance and developed normally under non stressful growth conditions which suggested that the pathway is either non essential or is required only under particular growth conditions . we determined that despite recognition by tub the antigen associated with the nuc and cyb structures was not tubulin . the nuc and cyb structures remained unlabelled when the mutants were probed with other tubulin specific antibodies and suggested that tub cross reacts with a component common to the nuc and cyb structures . in wild type cells tub labelled only microtubules and thus failed to localize to the normal cellular distribution of the protein that accumulated in nuc and cyb structures . electron microscopy analysis revealed that the nuc structures are perinuclear clusters of membranous tubules each about nm in diameter and filled with fibrillar material . immunogold labelling showed that tub recognized contents of the nuc structures . the cyb structures resembled _LOCATION_ dilations that included the presence of ribosomes at their surface but were smaller and were filled with a crystalline material . _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ reporters for _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the mutants confirmed that the _LOCATION_ cages are part of the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . the cyb structures were not marked by either _METHOD_ reporter and the numerous _LOCATION_ fusiform bodies labelled with _METHOD_ hdel were larger than the cytoplasmic bodies . double immunogold labelling with tub and anti _METHOD_ _METHOD_ distributed to distinct but contiguous organelles . these observations indicated that the nuc mutation via accumulation of the tub cross reactive protein causes aggregation of _LOCATION_ around the _LOCATION_ while the cyb mutation causes aggregates of the same protein to accumulate in small compartments within some small unspecified endomembrane compartments . we identified the tub cross reactive protein by organelle fractionation . based on the extensive perinuclear _LOCATION_ we predicted that the _LOCATION_ fraction isolated from nuc plants would be enriched in the tub cross reactive protein . immunoblotting showed that tub recognized in addition to the kda tubulin band a approximately kda band which was detected in the _LOCATION_ pellet and to a lesser extent in the supernatant from nuc plants but was not detected in the wild type extracts . sequencing of the kda protein band identified a kda myrosinase associated protein encoded by _GENE_ . to confirm that was indeed the target of tub we _PROTEIN_ this protein in escherichia coli cells . by immunoblot analysis of the bacterial pellet lysate with tub we detected a strong approximately kda band in the lane that corresponded to isopropyl d thiogalactopyranoside induced cells that _PROTEIN_ . we determined that tub recognized a c terminal motif of by comparing the sequences of the antibody epitope and using the clustalw multiple sequence alignment tool . the tub antibody was raised against a synthetic peptide that consisted of an amino terminal lysine followed by _PROTEIN_ terminal amino acids including a terminal tyrosine of _PROTEIN_ tubulin . this antibody reacts specifically with epitopes present in tyrosinated tubulin but not in the _PROTEIN_ terminal peptide of the detyrosinated form . the clustalw alignment predicted that tub would bind to the c terminus of which has two c terminal tyrosine residues . site directed mutagenesis to remove the two c terminal tyrosine residues almost completely abolished the tub labelling thus confirming that these residues are a part of the tub epitope . given that protein is not detected in the wild type plant by tub we investigated the possibility that gene _PROTEIN_ does not normally occur in young wild type seedlings . transcript analysis by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction determined that is indeed _PROTEIN_ in day old wild type seedlings . interestingly transcript levels were equivalent in wild type plants and cyb but greatly reduced in nuc . has been detected in _LOCATION_ tonoplast and cell wall proteomes . based on this knowledge and our finding that can not be detected by tub in wild type plants we hypothesized that is normally rapidly exported from the _LOCATION_ and that its processing involves modification of the c terminus . to test this hypothesis we made a c terminal _METHOD_ construct and drove _PROTEIN_ with the _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ . we chose _METHOD_ because it is better suited for acidic compartments than _METHOD_ which displays weak _METHOD_ under acidic conditions . in cells of stably transformed lines _METHOD_ accumulated in the aberrant structures of nuc and cyb . counter staining with tub antibody confirmed that these structures are identical with those shown in figure . we detected no _METHOD_ signal in wild type cells a finding that supported the hypothesis that the c terminal region of is normally modified or degraded soon after synthesis . we next constructed an n terminal citrine yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion of . the _METHOD_ coding sequence was inserted after the sequence that encodes the signal peptide and six n terminal amino acids and _PROTEIN_ was driven by _PROTEIN_ . in stably transformed mutant seedlings _METHOD_ localized to the nuc and cyb structures . in stably transformed wild type seedlings most cells were devoid of _METHOD_ signal but small spherical structures were observed in some guard cells . using a transient overexpression system to co _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the _LOCATION_ marker mcherry hdel under _PROTEIN_ we determined that _METHOD_ accumulated in the abundant perinuclear _LOCATION_ in nuc and to compartments that were coincident with the peripheral _LOCATION_ network in cyb and wild type cells . in contrast with the chain of beads appearance of the cyb structures the _METHOD_ compartments in wild type cells were spherical bodies approximately in diameter . there was no evidence of _METHOD_ in _LOCATION_ or apoplastic compartments which suggested that n terminal modification and loss of the _METHOD_ tag also occur . to further investigate the accumulation of full length _METHOD_ in cyb and nuc compartments and its processing in wild type plants protein extracts from wild type cyb and nuc seedlings stably _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and immunoblotted with anti _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and tub anti tubulin . three polypeptides were recognized by anti _METHOD_ in cyb and nuc extracts including a approximately kda band that corresponded to the full length _METHOD_ a approximately kda band likely to be the _METHOD_ plus part of the n terminus of as well as a smaller less focused band around kda which most likely corresponded to free _METHOD_ . the tub antibody in addition to labelling kda tubulin recognized both approximately kda and approximately kda bands in nuc and cyb extracts that corresponded to full length _METHOD_ and endogenous respectively . in the wild type extracts only a very faint approximately kda band was detected with anti _METHOD_ consistent with the small amount of _METHOD_ observed in guard cells . interestingly both the approximately and kda bands were labelled with similar intensity to the mutant extracts in the _METHOD_ transformed wild type extract despite lack of _METHOD_ . this loss of _METHOD_ suggests that the protein in the and kda bands was modified or partially degraded . taken together the immunolabelling and live imaging results indicated that in wild type plants is only transiently resident in a specific _LOCATION_ subcompartment and that it is either post translationally modified prior to export or targeted for degradation . both cyb and nuc mutations impeded its transport from the _LOCATION_ with nuc having a more severe effect . using a map based cloning approach we identified nuc as a single base pair mutation from g to a in the fifth exon of _GENE_ resulting in a _PROTEIN_ substitution . _GENE_ encodes a amino acid protein that belongs to the gdsl like lipase family . three research groups have identified independent _METHOD_ mutants in _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ that display the same formation of large perinuclear aggregates as nuc . we confirmed that nuc is allelic to _PROTEIN_ by carrying out a complementation test using a _METHOD_ hdel _PROTEIN_ nuc line as pollen donor . perinuclear _LOCATION_ aggregates were evident in the transheterozygous progeny . immunoblotting with tub confirmed that as with nuc mutants accumulated in _PROTEIN_ . of note the nuc mutation is located within the c terminal part of the gdsl lipase domain whereas the previously described _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations are restricted to the n terminal part of the protein . the nuc phenotype suggested that the c terminal part of this protein is also essential for function . the mutation affects a region adjacent to sequence block v that is highly conserved among gdsl lipases and contains aspartate and histidine residues as part of a catalytic triad . the nuc substitution of glycine in position by a larger positively charged arginine may affect the _PROTEIN_ structure of the protein and render it non functional . as previous reports demonstrated that disruption of _PROTEIN_ resulted in a general _LOCATION_ export defect we investigated the distribution of selected secretory markers the _LOCATION_ markers _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ mcherry and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and apoplast marker gpi anchored _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in nuc mutants . we also tested the distribution of these markers in wild type and cyb plants . as with previous studies we found that disruption of _GENE_ causes partial retention of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and apoplast markers to the perinuclear structures of nuc seedlings . the cyb mutation did not affect the distribution of any of the secretory markers tested . these results suggested that in contrast with general defect in trafficking of secretory proteins in nuc mutants the cyb mutation leads to a more specific defect in trafficking of . using an _METHOD_ based positional cloning strategy we determined that the cyb mutation is a single nucleotide substitution from g to a in the second exon of the _GENE_ gene . _GENE_ encodes a small kda type i _LOCATION_ protein that belongs to the _LOCATION_ family known in animal and yeast _METHOD_ to be involved in selective protein transport between _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . the missense cyb mutation substitutes the conserved glycine residue with glutamate within the gold domain implicated in protein protein interactions . the secondary structure predictions showed that the gold domain is a compact all fold structure and that the hydrophobic cores that support the predicted strands exhibit the highest sequence conservation . thus the substitution of the conserved small neutral glycine residue with a larger negatively charged glutamate is likely to disrupt the gold domain 's structure and consequently the protein 's function . to confirm that the mutation in _GENE_ causes the cyb phenotype the line with a t dna insertion in the first intron of _GENE_ was obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center _PROTEIN_ . semi quantitative rt pcr analysis of the homozygote confirmed that it is a transcript null allele . immunoblotting and _METHOD_ with tub determined that the homozygous _GENE_ transcript null and cyb mutants have identical phenotypes this finding indicated that the substitution within the gold domain renders cyb non functional . we hereafter designated the substitution mutant cyb and the t dna insertion line as cyb . importantly the cyb heterozygote also formed fewer cyb structures than the homozygote and indicated that like cyb cyb is semi dominant . the semi dominant nature of both the cyb missense and cyb knock out mutations suggested that the cyb phenotype is not dominant negative but instead results from haplo insufficiency in which a single functional copy produces insufficient protein for full function . to prove that the substitution is not dominant negative we first overexpressed the mutant version of using the _PROTEIN_ in wild type plants _PROTEIN_ . this _PROTEIN_ did not generate a cyb phenotype which would be expected if the mutation were dominant negative . we next determined that constitutive overexpression of wild type _GENE_ in cyb homozygotes prevented cytoplasmic body formation . immunoblotting analysis confirmed that the isotype recognized by tub did not accumulate in wild type seedlings that overexpressed the mutant gene or from cyb mutants that overexpressed wild type cyb . taken together these results indicated that loss of function mutations in _GENE_ were indeed responsible for the cyb phenotype and that haplo insufficiency rather than dominant negativity explains the semi dominance . we determined that cyb is localized both to the _LOCATION_ and to the _LOCATION_ . using a transient _PROTEIN_ system to drive _PROTEIN_ of n terminal _METHOD_ protein fusions we found that both wild type _METHOD_ and mutant _METHOD_ proteins have a characteristic cortical _LOCATION_ distribution pattern and co localize with the _LOCATION_ marker mcherry hdel . however in contrast with mutant only wild type cyb also localized to punctate structures that co localized with the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ mcherry . thus the mutation while rendering cyb non functional also affected its distribution possibly through interference with its export from the _LOCATION_ . we predicted that _PROTEIN_ protein should co localize with . when co _PROTEIN_ in the cyb mutant _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were co localized in the cyb compartments . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was also more broadly distributed throughout the _LOCATION_ and within the _LOCATION_ which is its normal distribution pattern in wild type cells . based on _PROTEIN_ 's co localization with and the severe distortion of the perinuclear _LOCATION_ in nuc compared with the association of the smaller cyb compartments with the peripheral _LOCATION_ network we postulated that _PROTEIN_ acts upstream of cyb in the trafficking of and hypothesized that nuc cyb double mutants would be phenotypically nuc . _METHOD_ analysis of segregants from a cross between homozygous nuc and cyb plants identified wild type putative cyb heterozygotes six putative cyb homozygotes and nuc homozygotes . no segregants contained both cyb and nuc structures . according to a chi squared test analysis the segregation fits a ratio predicted if the recessive nuc is epistatic to the semi dominant cyb . two of the phenotypically nuc were genotyped as double homozygotes using the following strategy . when crossed to wild type plants all the progeny from these phenotypically nuc plants showed the heterozygous cyb phenotype and confirmed that the parents were homozygous for cyb . all segregants of these two lines had the nuc phenotype and their double mutant status was confirmed by crossing each line with cyb and nuc homozygotes all progeny from crosses with cyb and nuc homozygotes were phenotypically cyb and nuc respectively . the _PROTEIN_ that double mutants only form nuc structures demonstrated the epistatic relationship between nuc and cyb and supported the hypothesis that both genes are involved in the same pathway with the cyb mutation affecting a process that is downstream of nuc .
