auxin affects the shape of root _METHOD_ by influencing elongation and branching . because multidrug resistance like abc transporters participate in auxin transport they may be expected to contribute to root system development . this reverse genetic study of arabidopsis thaliana roots shows that _PROTEIN_ mediated basipetal auxin transport did not affect root elongation or branching . however impaired acropetal auxin transport due to mutation of the _PROTEIN_ gene caused of nascent _PROTEIN_ roots to arrest their growth and the remainder to elongate more slowly than the wild type . reporter gene analyses indicated a severe auxin deficit in the apex of _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ roots . the _PROTEIN_ deficit was explained by less acropetal auxin transport within the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ roots . the slow elongation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ roots was rescued by auxin and phenocopied in the wild type by an inhibitor of _PROTEIN_ auxin transport . confocal microscopy analysis of a functional green _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ translational fusion showed the protein to be auxin inducible and present in the tissues responsible for acropetal transport in the primary root . the protein also accumulated in _PROTEIN_ root primordia and _PROTEIN_ in the tissues responsible for acropetal transport within the _PROTEIN_ root fully supporting the conclusion that auxin levels established by _PROTEIN_ dependent acropetal transport control _PROTEIN_ root growth rate to influence root system architecture .
the large contribution of _PROTEIN_ to acropetal auxin transport implies that this abc transporter functions in the central tissues of the root and not the epidermis . however an _PROTEIN_ profiling study that separately analyzed several root tissues at different stages of development indicated that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ at reasonably high levels throughout the root apex . broad _PROTEIN_ across the root apex was confirmed in an analysis of plant lines transformed with the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ reporter gene under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter _METHOD_ . the finding that the _PROTEIN_ promoter is active in all tissues of the root apex may seem at odds with a major role for _PROTEIN_ specifically in acropetal auxin transport . the apparent inconsistency was resolved by confocal microscopy analysis of _PROTEIN_ mutant plants engineered to _PROTEIN_ a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ translational fusion driven by the native _PROTEIN_ promoter _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the _METHOD_ signal in the root apex of these transgenic lines clearly emanated from the periphery of cells in the stele and cortex but not from epidermal or _PROTEIN_ root cap cells . thus the _PROTEIN_ protein is in the tissues expected of a _PROTEIN_ required for normal acropetal auxin transport in roots and it is absent from tissues that transport auxin basipetally . the absence of _PROTEIN_ in the epidermis and _PROTEIN_ root cap sites of basipetal transport appears to be achieved by a posttranscriptional mechanism . this localization pattern was typical of the most apical cm of the primary root . more basal regions of the root displayed less _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signal in the cortex . in the most mature regions of the root _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was restricted to the stele . at the subcellular level the _METHOD_ signal was localized to the periphery of the _PROTEIN_ cells consistent with multiple lines of evidence indicating that _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein . unlike the _PROTEIN_ localized _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ appears to be evenly distributed along all sides of the cells in the stele . in cortical cells the protein appears to be equally present at the apical and basal ends of cells . in the cortical cells close to root meristem the protein distribution is along all sides of the cells however the protein is often less concentrated along the cortical/epidermal cell boundary but not always . one of the earliest links between mdr proteins and auxin was the finding that _PROTEIN_ mrna was upregulated by iaa . figures and show that this effect of iaa translates into an increase in _PROTEIN_ protein . the upregulation by iaa occurs in the cells that normally _PROTEIN_ the gene and not in cells in which its _PROTEIN_ is posttranscriptionally suppressed . the subcellular localization pattern was not changed by iaa treatment but the generally higher levels accentuated the deficit in the periclinal walls of the cortical epidermal cell boundary . early work with _PROTEIN_ also showed that it could bind the _PROTEIN_ auxin transport inhibitor npa . one possible mode of action for npa would be for it to affect the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ . treatment of roots for h with npa did not affect the level or localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ indicating there is no short term effect of the blocker on _PROTEIN_ levels or localization . however treatment for d with or especially npa resulted in a loss of _PROTEIN_ from the most apical portion of the root . thus effects of long term npa treatment on auxin transport could be due in part to reduced levels of _PROTEIN_ . changes in auxin levels do not explain the effect of npa on _PROTEIN_ protein levels because in the same area where _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ npa causes auxin to accumulate and auxin induces higher levels of _PROTEIN_ . the effect of npa on _PROTEIN_ levels is probably not a general effect on _LOCATION_ proteins because the anonymous _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker _METHOD_ was not affected by npa . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants were used to test the connection between each of the two antiparallel auxin transport _METHOD_ and root branching . figure shows that branching of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ root _METHOD_ was defective and the defect was completely suppressed by _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ molecule used for the localization studies in figures and confirming that the phenotype is due to the loss of _PROTEIN_ function . loss of _PROTEIN_ had no detectable effect on _PROTEIN_ root branching at this level of analysis . tests on media containing or sucrose did not reveal a difference in _PROTEIN_ root production between the wild type and either allele of _PROTEIN_ . one explanation of the whole plant level observations in figures and is that impaired acropetal but not basipetal auxin transport in the primary root somehow negatively affects root branching . the reduced root branching in _PROTEIN_ may have been due to a reduced rate of primordium formation . to investigate this possibility the observable primordia in d old seedlings were counted and classified using the methods and nomenclature of citation . the results in table show that _PROTEIN_ roots contained as many _PROTEIN_ root primordia as the wild type and that these primordia were distributed across the different developmental stages similarly to the wild type . this result implies that the earliest events in _PROTEIN_ root production such as cell cycle activation within the pericycle are not affected by a _PROTEIN_ in acropetal auxin transport and the visible _PROTEIN_ phenotype is probably due to reduced postemergence growth of the _PROTEIN_ roots . this interpretation was supported by the finding that of _PROTEIN_ roots in _PROTEIN_ did not enter an elongation phase after emergence compared with only that arrested in the wild type . furthermore the elongation rate of those _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ roots that grew after emerging was slower than the wild type . again the slower growth was completely corrected by the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgene . the _PROTEIN_ mutation had no significant effect on the rate of primary root elongation . loss of _PROTEIN_ which reduced basipetal auxin transport by did not affect the growth of _PROTEIN_ roots at any stage of development or elongation of the primary root . mutations in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ do not affect _PROTEIN_ root initiation histochemical analysis of the _PROTEIN_ auxin reporter in wild type and _PROTEIN_ root _METHOD_ was performed to determine if reduced acropetal auxin transport altered auxin distribution in a way that could explain the impaired _PROTEIN_ root growth . the representative results in figure show a severe auxin deficit in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ root primordia from early stages through postemergence development . in the primary root apex the _PROTEIN_ mutation resulted only in a small reduction in gus signal in a region of the stele just basal to the apical maximum . blocking _PROTEIN_ auxin transport in wild type plants by transferring them to media containing npa produced an auxin deficit in _PROTEIN_ root primordia essentially like that of _PROTEIN_ . with longer staining times of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ root primordia showed some gus signal indicating that a very weak auxin gradient persists in _PROTEIN_ primordia but npa treatment completely eliminated the gus signal . in the primary root apex npa caused an increase in the gus signal as has been observed before . if this npa induced increase is due to blocked efflux of auxin synthesized at the root apex then the opposite response of _PROTEIN_ root apices may be evidence that they produce less auxin than the primary root apex . an _PROTEIN_ line transformed with _METHOD_ was constructed for use in the citation studies on gravitropism . it was used here to examine the influence of _PROTEIN_ on auxin distribution in developing _PROTEIN_ roots . consistent with the lack of effect of the _PROTEIN_ mutations on _PROTEIN_ root growth and development auxin distribution appeared normal in these mutants . confocal analysis of the functional _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ molecule showed it distinctly accumulated in pericycle derivatives beginning at an early stage of primordium development and _PROTEIN_ as in the primary root it was restricted to the central cylinder and cortical cells in which acropetal auxin transport occurs . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localization and gus patterns indicate that _PROTEIN_ is required for acropetal auxin transport within the _PROTEIN_ root . the results of a iaa based transport assay supported this hypothesis . as shown in figure acropetal transport within the _PROTEIN_ root was reduced by in _PROTEIN_ mutants and like the effect of the mutations on growth rate the transport defect was rescued by the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ molecule . the following experiments addressed the relationships between _PROTEIN_ controlled auxin levels in the _PROTEIN_ root and the control of _PROTEIN_ root elongation . exogenous iaa approximately doubled _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ root growth rate almost completely restoring it to wild type levels . npa which phenocopied the gus pattern in _PROTEIN_ reduced the growth rate of wild type _PROTEIN_ roots to the same level as _PROTEIN_ . npa did not further reduce _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ root growth rate . these data indicate that an auxin deficit arising from impaired acropetal transport within the _PROTEIN_ root limited the elongation rate of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ roots .
