plant parasitic nematodes meloidogyne spp induce an elaborate permanent feeding site characterized by the redifferentiation of root cells into multinucleate and hypertrophied giant cells . we have isolated by a promoter trap strategy an arabidopsis thaliana formin gene _PROTEIN_ which is upregulated during giant cell formation . formins are actin nucleating proteins that stimulate de novo polymerization of actin filaments . we show here that three type i formins were upregulated in giant cells and that the _PROTEIN_ protein was anchored to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and uniformly distributed . suppression of the budding defect of the saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant showed that _PROTEIN_ regulates _PROTEIN_ growth by controlling the assembly of actin cables . our results suggest that _PROTEIN_ might be involved in the isotropic growth of hypertrophied feeding cells via the reorganization of the actin _LOCATION_ . the actin cables would serve as tracks for vesicle trafficking needed for extensive _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and cell wall biogenesis . therefore determining how plant parasitic nematodes modify root cells into giant cells represents an attractive system to identify genes that regulate cell growth and morphogenesis .
to isolate genes involved in the development of giant cells induced by meloidogyne incognita a promoter trap strategy was developed with a promoterless _PROTEIN_ construct being introduced randomly into the arabidopsis genome via agrobacterium tumefaciens t dna transformation . we screened t dna tagged arabidopsis lines by gus assay after root knot nematode infection and identified lines showing gus induction in root galls . one of the lines displayed early gus activity in galls which was detected < h after giant cell initiation . gus activity was detected over a week period but was not detected thereafter in fully differentiated giant cells . cross sections of d old galls clearly showed gus staining in the giant cells and in the neighboring cells . no gus activity was detected in the cortical cells of the gall . during plant development gus _PROTEIN_ was observed in differentiating cells of the vascular cylinder just above the root meristem . gus activity was also detected in the vascular tissue of the _PROTEIN_ root primordium and in the emerged _PROTEIN_ root . gus staining was observed neither in the root apical meristem nor in the differentiated root . in young seedlings low levels of promoter activity were also detected in the vascular bundles of leaves and in the _PROTEIN_ . in the shoots of older plants gus activity was restricted to the _PROTEIN_ . in addition in etiolated seedlings gus activity was detected only in the apical hook and not in the remaining elongated hypocotyl . the line carried a single t dna insert . a kb genomic dna fragment adjacent to the right border of the t dna was isolated by kanamycin plasmid rescue . sequence analysis using the arabidopsis information resource showed that the t dna had integrated into the predicted gene _GENE_ on chromosome . the corresponding cdna was cloned by rapid amplification of cdna ends _PROTEIN_ pcr . the cdna is nucleotides long and contains an open reading frame of amino acids . comparison of the genomic and cdna sequences revealed that the gene contained four exons . integration of the t dna resulted in a bp deletion and the insertion of a bp filler sequence . the t dna had inserted into the first exon bp downstream from the _PROTEIN_ placing the _PROTEIN_ of the gus gene in frame with the gene resulting in a functional gene fusion . analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by showed it to be a member of the _PROTEIN_ protein family from arabidopsis identified by in silico analysis . it was therefore named a. thaliana formin homology protein _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ protein bears the two structural features common to _PROTEIN_ proteins a pro rich formin homology _PROTEIN_ domain in front of a conserved c terminal _PROTEIN_ domain hallmark of members of the formin family . the _PROTEIN_ domain of _PROTEIN_ contains pro with stretches of three to nine consecutive pro residues and two ww binding sequences _PROTEIN_ separated by a amino acid spacer and several binding sequences . the _PROTEIN_ domain of _PROTEIN_ was found to display to sequence similarity to the equivalent domains of the other _PROTEIN_ proteins . similarity was greatest with _PROTEIN_ and the rice predicted protein _PROTEIN_ . we investigated the possible relationships between plant _PROTEIN_ sequences and between these sequences and those of known _PROTEIN_ from animals and fungi by protein sequence comparison _METHOD_ such as the neighbor joining tree method . the plant _PROTEIN_ sequences clustered and formed a lineage distinct from that of fungi insect and vertebrate _PROTEIN_ members . plant _PROTEIN_ can be divided into two i and type previously described for _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and rice _PROTEIN_ proteins clearly belong to the type i subclass . unlike the _PROTEIN_ proteins of animals and fungi such as the budding yeast proteins and drosophila _PROTEIN_ and mouse and human _PROTEIN_ no n terminal _PROTEIN_ homology domain required for correct targeting or coiled coil domain were identified in plant formins . moreover the plant _PROTEIN_ characterized to date lack both the _PROTEIN_ binding domain and the diaphanous autoregulatory domain . these two domains interact to inactivate the formin . however _PROTEIN_ and the other type i plant formins have an n terminal domain with a putative signal peptide or _LOCATION_ anchor and a transmembrane domain adjacent to a second pro rich region suggesting that this protein is targeted for secretion and integration into a _LOCATION_ . the region between the signal peptide and the transmembrane domain contains pro but is not rich in ser and does not contain the _PROTEIN_ motif characteristic of plant cell wall extensin glycoproteins as described for _PROTEIN_ . interestingly this pro rich sequence contains a _PROTEIN_ sequence homologous to the ww binding sequence _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and overlapping binding sequences which mediate protein protein interactions . thus _PROTEIN_ may exert or regulate its biological functions by interacting with proteins containing and ww domains via this pro rich sequence and/or the _PROTEIN_ domain . we have characterized the role of _PROTEIN_ in plant development and giant cell formation by isolating plants homozygous for the mutation . the plants were macroscopically not distinguishable from the wild type and developed normally . in addition after nematode infection homozygous mutant plants had a similar number of galls compared with wild type plants . giant cell structure and nematode development were also similar to what was observed in wild type control plants . this lack of a visible phenotype may be because of incomplete loss of protein function as the n terminal part of the protein in homozygous plants includes the _PROTEIN_ domain fused to gus or more probably because of the presence of other _PROTEIN_ genes with overlapping in their _PROTEIN_ patterns resulting in genetic redundancy . therefore we have used gene specific pcr primers to amplify each predicted transcript of the _PROTEIN_ genes . rt pcr analysis showed that only two additional type i _PROTEIN_ genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ in galls . quantitative rt pcr showed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were significantly upregulated in galls and dpi compared with uninfected nonmeristematic root fragments . no upregulation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was detected dpi in fully differentiated giant cells . these results confirm the _PROTEIN_ pattern of deduced from experiments with the gus reporter gene and show that three _PROTEIN_ genes are activated during gall formation induced by root knot nematodes . the prediction of peptide domains and hydropathy profile determination suggested that _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ protein anchored to a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or endomembrane . we have localized the _PROTEIN_ protein using a polyclonal antibody directed against part of the c terminal sequence of the _PROTEIN_ domain . in protein gel blots with an insoluble microsomal fraction prepared from young seedlings we detected a single band at kd consistent with the predicted molecular _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ . no signal was detected in cytoplasmic fractions or in microsomal fractions obtained from the homozygous plants in which gus replaced the c terminal amino acids of _PROTEIN_ . these results indicate that is specific for _PROTEIN_ protein and does not cross react with the other arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ . in addition protein gel blots performed with proteins from highly purified _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of arabidopsis cells showed that _PROTEIN_ protein is more abundant in this fraction compared with the endomembranes or the microsomal fraction . no signal was detected in the _LOCATION_ fraction . immunolocalization of the protein in galls using confirmed the _PROTEIN_ pattern observed with gus staining . the _PROTEIN_ protein was detected only in giant cells and in neighboring cells . _PROTEIN_ was detected only in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of giant cells and no _METHOD_ was seen in the typically dense cytoplasm . no signal was detected in galls of homozygous seedlings . immunostaining on sections of actin in giant cells revealed a higher density of actin label in the cell cortex than within the dense cytoplasm . in root apex _PROTEIN_ staining was confined to differentiating cells within the vascular cylinder confirming the _PROTEIN_ pattern observed with gus staining . cross sections showed that the _PROTEIN_ protein was located along the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as observed for gall cells . to confirm the _PROTEIN_ subcellular localization transient _PROTEIN_ of fusion proteins with green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ was performed in protoplasts prepared from arabidopsis cell suspensions . the green _METHOD_ signal clearly delineated the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ associated with the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion or the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker _METHOD_ fusion . _METHOD_ fusion with _PROTEIN_ a metal transporter targeted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ led to a _METHOD_ confined to the tonoplast differently than observed for _PROTEIN_ . we investigated the role of _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ organization by determining whether _PROTEIN_ functionally suppressed and deficiency in yeast . the _PROTEIN_ proteins and of the budding yeast s. cerevisiae were recently shown to regulate _PROTEIN_ growth by controlling the assembly of actin cables . we introduced the full length _PROTEIN_ cdna under the control of a galactose inducible promoter into a yeast mutant . at the permissive temperature grew slower than the wild type strain but nevertheless cells displayed the budding and wild type phenotype . at the restrictive temperature all double mutant cells became enlarged and were unable to divide as described by citation . dna stained by dapi also _METHOD_ that cells are often multinucleate indicating that synthesis and division of _LOCATION_ dnas are not primarily affected . the cells containing which carried _PROTEIN_ grew at only in the presence of galactose indicating suppression of the phenotype . analysis of actin organization showed that in wild type cells actin patches were _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ restricted to the bud whereas actin cables were oriented along the length of the cell . by contrast actin patches were randomly distributed in enlarged cells with no actin cables apparent . in hiy and hiy cells the budding defect and cell enlargement of the mutant were rescued by suppression at the restrictive temperature . in these budding cells some actin cables were visible in the mother cell and actin patches were _PROTEIN_ to the bud . in some suppressed hiy cells actin patches were still seen in the mother cells . no growth defect or extra actin cables were detected in wild type cells producing _PROTEIN_ as previously reported after the overproduction of formin protein fragments . these experiments showed that _PROTEIN_ is functionally similar to yeast _PROTEIN_ proteins and that it plays a role in actin _LOCATION_ reorganization .
