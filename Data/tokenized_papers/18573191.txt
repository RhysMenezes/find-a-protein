the water uptake capacity of plant roots is determined in large part by aquaporins of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ intrinsic protein _PROTEIN_ subfamily . in the present work we investigated two stimuli salicylic acid and salt because of their ability to induce an accumulation of reactive oxygen species and an inhibition of lpr concomitantly in the roots of arabidopsis plants . the inhibition of lpr by sa was partially counteracted by preventing the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide with exogenous catalase . in addition exogenous was able to reduce lpr by up to in < min . based on the lack of effects of on the activity of individual aquaporins in xenopus oocytes and on a pharmacological dissection of the action of on lpr we propose that ros do not gate arabidopsis root aquaporins through a direct oxidative mechanism but rather act through cell signalling _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ in transgenic roots of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions and immunogold labelling indicated that external enhanced in < min the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ in intracellular structures tentatively identified as vesicles and small _LOCATION_ . exposure of roots to sa or salt also induced an intracellular accumulation of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins and these effects were fully counteracted by co treatment with exogenous catalase . in conclusion the present work identifies sa as a novel regulator of aquaporins and delineates an ros dependent signalling pathway in the roots of arabidopsis . several abiotic and biotic stress related stimuli potentially share this path which involves an induced internalization of _PROTEIN_ to downregulate root water transport .
the accumulation of ros in roots was investigated by imaging the oxidatively sensitive _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ dichlorofluorescin _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ released intracellularly from its acetylesterified form _PROTEIN_ . in a general survey of environmental and/or hormonal stimuli we observed that the exposure of roots to sa for min increased the relative _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by and therefore triggered an accumulation of ros in root cells . we also checked in agreement with previous reports that the treatment of arabidopsis roots with salt induced an intracellular ros accumulation . whereas the time and dose dependent inhibition of root water transport by salt has already been described in arabidopsis and other species the effects of sa on tissue water transport have remained unexplored . to investigate these effects the pressure induced sap flow was measured in excised arabidopsis roots . figure shows that the application of mm sa at a constant kpa pressure induced a time dependent _PROTEIN_ in jv of in min . lower sa concentrations had no significant effect on jv . the effects of mm sa were fully reversed after < min after washout . in parallel experiments we determined pressure sap flow relationships and checked that the inhibition of jv by sa reflected an inhibition of lpr by a similar _PROTEIN_ . because of the relatively rapid kinetics of inhibition and reversion the effects of sa on lpr were interpreted to result from the regulation of root aquaporins . overall an inhibition of lpr by was observed after exposure for min to mm sa whereas the chemical analogue hydroxybenzoic acid induced a much lower inhibition with a concentration of mm . therefore the effects of sa on lpr can not be explained by a direct acid loading resulting from sa intracellular diffusion . to determine the role of ros in the sa dependent inhibition of lpr accumulation was prevented by treating roots with u catalase for min prior to exposure to mm sa for min . in these experiments the procedure significantly reduced the inhibition of lpr by sa from to . in contrast treatment of roots by catalase alone had no effect on lpr . these data show that the downregulation of root water transport by sa is mediated in part by an enhanced accumulation of . the effects of exogenous on whole root water transport were investigated using the same approach as has been exemplified for sa . figure shows that application of to excised root _METHOD_ induced a time and dose dependent _PROTEIN_ in jv . for instance exposure for min to mm concentrations led to a _PROTEIN_ in jv of . in the same experiments the half time of inhibition showed a tendency to reduce from min to min . the pressure sap flow relationships determined in parallel indicated that millimolar concentrations of exogenous reduced jv and lpr by the same _PROTEIN_ . we note that because of the presence of transition metals in the apoplasm the molecules acting on root water transport can be either or related ros in particular which is produced by a fenton reaction . because aquaporins contribute to more than of the lpr in arabidopsis the marked effects of on root water transport must be mediated in large part by an inhibition of aquaporin activity . to establish this idea further we investigated the effects of on the water relation parameters of single root cells in situ . cortical cells are the only cells of the arabidopsis root that are amenable to cell pressure probe measurements . figure shows that the treatment of roots for min by up to mm neither changed the stationary turgor nor changed the volumetric elastic modulus of these cells . by contrast the half time of water exchange was increased from to sec after treatment with concentrations of of up to mm . this resulted in a dose dependent inhibition of cell hydraulic conductivity by and in response to and mm respectively . because in the arabidopsis root cortex lpcell is in large part determined by aquaporins these data indicate that markedly reduced aquaporin activity in cortical cells without significantly altering solute accumulation or cell wall elasticity . to test the hypothesis of an oxidative gating of root aquaporins by ros the sensitivity of individual aquaporin _METHOD_ to ros inhibition was investigated after functional _PROTEIN_ in xenopus oocytes . we characterized among the most abundantly _PROTEIN_ aquaporins from arabidopsis roots three different _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and as representative members of three distinct subclasses . osmotic swelling assays showed that the osmotic water permeability of oocytes injected with the corresponding crnas was significantly higher than that of native oocytes showing that each of these aquaporins was functionally _PROTEIN_ in these cells . incubation for min in the presence of mm or mm plus mm feedta did not alter the water transport properties of native oocytes or oocytes _PROTEIN_ plant aquaporins . a longer treatment by mm did not significantly affect the pf of oocytes either . thus the water transport activity of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and was insensitive to or derived . exposure of plant cells to ros can initiate a influx and downstream signalling cascades which could ultimately lead to aquaporin downregulation . to test this hypothesis plants were cultivated in a free bathing solution for h prior to root excision . excised roots were then treated with an inhibitor of calcium channels and mm egta a divalent cation chelator . by comparison with control untreated roots jv was not altered after deprivation and h of the treatment . by contrast when added after min of this treatment mm induced a significant time dependent _PROTEIN_ in jv . however the percentage of inhibition by was _PROTEIN_ twofold with respect to that of control roots that were bathed in a standard solution containing . the inhibition resulting from treatment with mm similar between control roots and roots submitted to the pre treatment . the overall results are interpreted to mean that _LOCATION_ and probably a primary influx of in root cells contributed at least one half of the induced inhibition of root water transport . in supplementary experiments we probed for the involvement of phosphorylation events in the downstream response of roots to . treatment of excised roots with staurosporine a general blocker of protein kinases for min prior to the addition of mm did not affect the final percentage of the induced inhibition of jv . by contrast inhibition was significantly increased from min to min . altogether our data point to induced signalling _METHOD_ which would be mediated through both primary influx and phosphorylation events . the rapidity of lpr inhibition by suggested that aquaporin regulation might primarily occur at the post translational level . although a gating of aquaporins in response to _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ namely altered phosphorylation h or free may be involved here we evaluated the possible contribution of a stimulus induced relocalization of aquaporins . for this we used transgenic plants that _PROTEIN_ fusions of _METHOD_ with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ taken here as representative _PROTEIN_ aquaporins . laser scanning confocal microscopy of root epidermal cells revealed in plants grown in standard conditions a peripheral labelling pattern indicating predominant _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ fusions at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in cells distal from the root apex a slight reticulate perinuclear labelling was occasionally observed suggesting a partial retention of the fusion proteins in the secretory pathway . labelling of small intracellular spherical bodies was occasionally observed in and of epidermal cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ respectively . although these bodies might be related to the _PROTEIN_ endosome/pre _LOCATION_ compartment their precise nature remains undetermined . treatment of roots _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ fusions with mm for min resulted in a marked alteration of this labelling pattern with a strong enhancement of intracellular staining either diffuse or localized on discrete structures . in particular the percentage of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ cells showing a labelling of spherical bodies was raised to and respectively . to further quantify the effects of longitudinal optical sections of epidermal cells were taken at or mm from the apex and average gray values were integrated from delimited image surfaces corresponding to the cell periphery and the cell interior respectively . images were acquired in conditions where the labelling intensity of the cell surface was close to saturation and appeared constant between control and treated cells . in contrast treatment induced an increase by and > in the overall intracellular labelling in epidermal cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ respectively . transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ a _METHOD_ low temperature inducible protein _METHOD_ fusion used here as an independent marker of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ also showed although less pronounced than with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ an increase in intracellular labelling in response to by up to . we also observed a qualitatively similar response to mm in root cortical cells with enhanced intracellular labelling by _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ fusions . we note that in resting conditions the apparent intracellular labelling of cortical cells was higher than in epidermal cells probably because of a lower resolution of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ confocal imaging in the former cells . therefore the relative effects of on intracellular labelling might have been more difficult to resolve . to get an enhanced resolution of the cell _LOCATION_ responses to an ultrastructural analysis of epidermal cells was performed by transmission electron microscopy . immunocytochemistry on control untreated roots using an anti _PROTEIN_ antibody revealed a dense immunogold labelling along the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and occasionally in local invaginations of the _LOCATION_ within the _LOCATION_ space . treatment of roots with mm for min did not result in any significant morphological change of cell _LOCATION_ . however immunogold labelling was more diffuse along the cell surface and a marked _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the intracellular compartments was observed . altogether the microscopic data support the idea that exogenous enhances the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ aquaporins in intracellular _LOCATION_ possibly through relocalization from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . these findings prompted us to evaluate in closer detail the effects of sa and nacl on aquaporin subcellular localization and a possible role of ros in mediating these effects . treatment of roots of the aquaporin _METHOD_ reporter lines by sa resulted in marked changes in the intracellular labelling pattern of epidermal cells similar to those observed in response to . a diffuse localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ along the cell periphery and in spherical bodies was observed . in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants and at mm from the root apex the proportion of epidermal cells with labelled spherical bodies used here as a reliable indicator of intracellular accumulation of the _METHOD_ fusion was increased from to . treatment of roots by u catalase alone did not significantly alter the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labelling pattern of root epidermal cells . however when it was provided for min prior to the sa treatment catalase was able to counteract the sa effects by with the percentage of cells with labelled spherical bodies being similar to that of control untreated roots . these results suggest that the effects of sa on _PROTEIN_ subcellular localization are mediated via a pathway involving . exposure of arabidopsis roots _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to mm nacl for min also enhanced the intracellular staining of epidermal cells . these effects were similar in nature but were more rapid and pronounced than those previously observed in response to mm nacl . at mm from the root apex the proportion of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ cells showing a labelling of spherical bodies was increased by about threefold from to by treatment with salt . however the pre treatment of roots with catalase for min was able to reduce the salt enhancement of the labelling of spherical bodies by suggesting that these effects were mediated in large part through _LOCATION_ . altogether these observations show that exposure of roots to sa and salt leads to an accumulation of _PROTEIN_ aquaporins in intracellular structures that is qualitatively similar to that induced by exogenous . the effects of salt and sa on aquaporin localization are mediated in part through ros the accumulation of which is enhanced by these two treatments . these chains of events may contribute to the inhibitory effects of the two stimuli on root water transport .
