it is currently held that thiamin is made in chloroplasts and converted in the _LOCATION_ to the active cofactor thiamin diphosphate and that mitochondria and _LOCATION_ import thdp . the organellar transporters that mediate thdp import in plants have not been identified . comparative genomic analysis indicated that two members of the mitochondrial carrier family in arabidopsis and two in maize _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are related to the thdp carriers of animals and saccharomyces cerevisiae . _PROTEIN_ of each of these plant proteins in a s. cerevisiae thdp carrier _PROTEIN_ null mutant complemented the growth defect on fermentable _PROTEIN_ sources and restored the level of mitochondrial thdp and the activity of the mitochondrial thdp dependent enzyme acetolactate synthase . the plant proteins were targeted to mitochondria as judged by dual import assays with purified pea mitochondria and chloroplasts and by microscopic analysis of the subcellular localization of green _METHOD_ protein fusions in transiently transformed tobacco suspension cells . both maize genes were shown to be _PROTEIN_ throughout the plant which is consistent with the known ubiquity of mitochondrial thdp dependent enzymes . collectively these data establish that plants have mitochondrially located mcf carriers for thdp and indicate that these carriers are highly evolutionarily conserved . our data provide a firm basis to propagate the functional annotation of mitochondrial thdp carriers to other angiosperm genomes .
a previous general phylogenetic analysis of human yeast and arabidopsis mcf proteins identified _GENE_ and _GENE_ as candidate thdp carriers both fell in the same clade as the human thdp carrier and close to yeast _PROTEIN_ . _GENE_ and _GENE_ share amino acid identity . blast searches of the maize genome using either arabidopsis sequence as query detected only two close matches _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . these maize candidates share amino acid identity with the arabidopsis proteins and with each other . targeted phylogenetic analyses of the four plant candidates the human yeast and drosophila thdp carriers and all arabidopsis yeast or human mcf proteins consistently grouped all four candidates and the known carriers in the same clade . thus among all arabidopsis mcf proteins those closest to the known thdp carriers are the candidates and among all yeast or human mcf proteins the candidates are closest to the known thdp carriers . the phylogenetic trees all locate the arabidopsis and maize candidates in separate clades indicating that the two genes in each species arose via independent relatively recent duplication events . deletion of the yeast _PROTEIN_ gene encoding the thdp carrier results in thiamin auxotrophy on synthetic minimal medium containing a fermentable _PROTEIN_ source such as galactose . this auxotrophy enables a functional complementation assay for thdp transport activity . the four candidate plant thdp carriers were therefore cloned into yeast _PROTEIN_ vector and tested for the capacity to restore thiamin prototrophy on sm medium plus galactose to the _PROTEIN_ strain . all four candidates restored growth on thiamin free medium almost to wild type levels whereas cells transformed with the vector alone or vector harboring a negative control mcf protein _PROTEIN_ showed very little or no growth . when _PROTEIN_ cells are cultured on thiamin less sm medium plus galactose their mitochondrial thdp content falls far below that of wild type cells . as with the growth phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ strain this biochemical phenotype was complemented by each of the arabidopsis or maize proteins . thus _PROTEIN_ of the plant proteins raised the mitochondrial thdp level to at least that of the wild type . mitochondrial thmp levels were not significantly impacted either by the _PROTEIN_ mutation or by _PROTEIN_ of the plant proteins . the data for mitochondrial thdp are strong evidence that the plant proteins mediate thdp entry into mitochondria . further support for this inference was obtained by measuring the activities of thdp dependent enzymes . when thdp is not added to assays the activity of the mitochondrial thdp dependent enzyme acetolactate synthase extracted from _PROTEIN_ cells is depressed whereas that of the _LOCATION_ thdp enzyme pyruvate decarboxylase is not . supplementing assays with thdp raises acetolactate synthase activity of the _PROTEIN_ mutant to normal levels showing that the activity reduction is due solely to cofactor deficiency . _PROTEIN_ of each of the candidate proteins restored the activity of acetolactate synthase assayed without thdp to wild type levels but did not affect pyruvate decarboxylase activity . collectively these data show that _PROTEIN_ of the plant thdp carrier candidates is able to reverse the intramitochondrial thdp deficiency characteristic of _PROTEIN_ cells . subcellular localization of the four candidate plant thdp carriers was investigated first by dual import assays in which mixtures of isolated pea chloroplasts and mitochondria were incubated with a radiolabeled candidate carrier . soybean alternative oxidase and the arabidopsis ygfz protein _GENE_ served as positive controls for mitochondrial and chloroplast import respectively . after incubation with each of the candidates mitochondria contained a labeled product that was resistant to subsequent thermolysin digestion and was of the same size as the supplied precursor . this behavior is expected for members of the mcf family which typically lack cleavable targeting peptides and localize to the mitochondrial inner _LOCATION_ where they are protected from proteolytic degradation . by contrast no candidate protein was detected in thermolysin treated chloroplasts at more than the trace level seen in the alternative oxidase control . such trace levels can be ascribed to slight contamination of chloroplast fractions with mitochondria . subcellular localization of the candidate thdp carriers was also investigated using tobacco by suspension cultured cells serving as a well characterized system for studying protein targeting in vivo . specifically cells were transformed transiently with each of the four candidates fused to _METHOD_ at their n or c termini followed by _METHOD_ microscopic examination . the _PROTEIN_ c terminal fusions of both maize proteins and both arabidopsis proteins displayed a _METHOD_ pattern that co localized with that attributable to the endogenous mitochondrial protein cytochrome oxidase subunit ii . by contrast the n terminal _METHOD_ fusions for all four proteins localized solely to the _LOCATION_ . it therefore appears that fusion to _METHOD_ via the n terminus disrupts the mitochondrial localization of these mcf carriers . in no case did any of the fusion proteins examined in this study localize to _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to assess the physiological significance of each maize gene the relative levels of their mrnas were determined in ten diverse tissues representing the entire life cycle . _PROTEIN_ of both genes was readily detected in all tissues with that of _PROTEIN_ always the higher the average difference was fold rising to fold in pollen . microarray databases report that the two arabidopsis genes are also _PROTEIN_ throughout the plant their _PROTEIN_ levels generally differ no more than fold except in pollen where _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ is fold higher than that of _GENE_ . with a view to the potential use of our findings in the functional annotation of other plant genomes we searched the ncbi protein database for plant homologs of _GENE_ _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the best blastp hits among eudicot monocot and gymnosperm proteins shared identity with the arabidopsis and maize sequences this value fell to in lower land plants and to in green algae . in all taxa the best hits were clearly distinct from the next best blastp hits which shared only identity with the arabidopsis and maize sequences . phylogenetic analysis of the best blastp hits placed them in the same clade as _GENE_ _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the animal and yeast thdp transporters . within this clade the plant sequences were arranged as expected from organismal phylogeny . phylogenetic analyses of the next best blastp hits invariably placed them outside the thdp transporter clade .
