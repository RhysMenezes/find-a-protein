the intracellular distribution of organelles is a crucial aspect of effective cell function . chloroplasts change their intracellular positions to optimize photosynthetic activity in response to ambient light conditions . through screening of mutants of arabidopsis defective in chloroplast photorelocation movement we isolated six mutant clones in which chloroplasts gathered at the bottom of the cells and did not distribute throughout cells . these mutants termed chloroplast unusual positioning were shown to belong to a single genetic locus by complementation tests . observation of the positioning of other organelles such as mitochondria _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ revealed that chloroplast positioning and movement are impaired specifically in this mutant although _LOCATION_ are distributed along with chloroplasts . the _PROTEIN_ gene encodes a novel protein containing multiple domains including a coiled coil domain an actin binding domain a pro rich region and two leu zipper domains . the n terminal hydrophobic segment of _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ transiently in leaf cells of arabidopsis as a fusion protein with the green _METHOD_ protein . the fusion protein was targeted to envelope _LOCATION_ of chloroplasts in mesophyll cells suggesting that _PROTEIN_ may localize in chloroplasts . a glutathione s transferase fusion protein containing the actin binding domain of _PROTEIN_ was found to bind f actin in vitro . _PROTEIN_ is a unique gene identified that encodes a protein required for organellar positioning and movement in plant cells .
we screened t dna lines and ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenized arabidopsis seeds for plants defective in chloroplast movement . detached leaves were covered with a black plate with an open slit through which high intensity white light was supplied for h. the irradiated area of the wild type leaf changed from green to pale green and was clearly distinguishable from the nonirradiated area . the irradiated area of _PROTEIN_ leaves looked almost the same as the nonirradiated area . one mutant from t dna insertional mutant pools and five mutants from ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenized mutant pools were allelic . they were all determined to contain single _LOCATION_ recessive mutations by complementation tests . the effect of low and high light intensity on chloroplast positioning was observed in palisade cells . in wild type cells the chloroplasts accumulated along the periclinal cell walls under low light and along the anticlinal walls under high light . in the mutant cells chloroplast positioning was quite different from that in wild type plants under both low light and high light conditions but although many chloroplasts gathered in parts of the mutant cells it was difficult to determine the precise locations . to clarify the distribution patterns leaves of mutant and wild type plants were fixed and embedded and cross sections were observed in more detail . from these sections it was clear that the chloroplasts in mutant plants accumulated at the bottom of palisade and spongy cells . even when the mutant leaves were detached at their petioles and placed on the surface of an agar plate abaxial side up for days the positioning of the chloroplasts remained unchanged suggesting that chloroplast accumulation at the bottom of the cells was not simply the result of gravity dependent sedimentation . although chloroplasts in wild type cells changed their position depending on light intensity chloroplast movement in the mutant cells was slight if any movement occurred at all . next the distribution of mitochondria and _LOCATION_ in wild type and _PROTEIN_ cells was observed using transient transformation with green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusions to mitochondrial or peroxisomal targeting sequences . mitochondria were distributed throughout the cytoplasm _PROTEIN_ of whether movement occurred . the types of mitochondrial activity observed can be divided into three classes no movement slow movement in random directions and rapid linear directional movement . the latter type of movement may reflect cytoplasmic streaming . overall there were no differences in mitochondrial distribution number or movement patterns between wild type and _PROTEIN_ cells . most of the _LOCATION_ in palisade mesophyll cells were located adjacent to chloroplasts in both the wild type and the mutants and did not appear to move independently of chloroplast movement in contrast to those in the mitochondria . however the distribution of _LOCATION_ in palisade mesophyll cells of _PROTEIN_ differed from that of the wild type because they remained at the bottom of the cells along with the chloroplasts . because _LOCATION_ usually localize close to chloroplasts their abnormal distribution in _PROTEIN_ leaves likely is a secondary effect of chloroplast mislocalization . in epidermal cells lacking chloroplasts the _LOCATION_ moved actively around cells in both wild type and _PROTEIN_ leaves . to observe _LOCATION_ transverse sections of the leaves were made and stained with diamidino phenylindole . the localization of _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ cells was similar to that in wild type cells . overall we conclude that the effects of _PROTEIN_ are specific to chloroplast distribution and movement . a segment of the dna flanking the t dna insertion into _PROTEIN_ was isolated by plasmid rescue and used to screen an arabidopsis cdna library . because the cdna clone isolated in this screen which was a part of _GENE_ did not contain a full length insert rapid amplification of cdna ends was used to obtain the full length cdna . the cdna contained a single open reading frame of bp encoding a deduced protein of amino acid residues with a predicted molecular _METHOD_ of kd . the corresponding _PROTEIN_ gene contains nine exons and eight introns . the t dna insertion in the chup allele was located in exon . the molecular defects in the other alleles were characterized by sequencing genomic dna fragments . all of the alleles tested carried mutations in the same gene . the _PROTEIN_ and mutants all have single base substitutions resulting in stop codons . the _PROTEIN_ mutant has a single base substitution at the junction of exon and intron . the presence of a lesion in each of the six independent mutants tested is consistent with the role of this gene in chloroplast positioning . furthermore it was confirmed that _PROTEIN_ of a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ gene _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ driven by the promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus in _PROTEIN_ complemented the mutant phenotype . however _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was not detected in the resulting transformant . comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence against sequences available in public databases indicated that _PROTEIN_ contains some previously described domains including an actin binding domain a coiled coil region pro rich motifs and leu zipper motifs . the paircoil program predicted the presence of a coiled coil region . comparison with prosite a database of biologically significant sites patterns and profiles revealed the presence of an actinin type actin binding domain signature in _PROTEIN_ . comparison with the prosite database sequences revealed the presence of two leu zipper motifs . these regions may mediate protein protein interactions with other proteins or with itself . the region from pro to pro is abundant in pro residues . a pro rich motif can be classified by comparison with consensus sequences derived from several different prm binding domains . the prm of _PROTEIN_ is most similar to which has been identified as a profilin binding motif . a hydrophilicity plot revealed the presence of a short hydrophobic region at the n terminal end of the protein . comparison of the _PROTEIN_ sequence with sequences in the signalp database which enables prediction of the presence and location of signal peptides led to the prediction that the hydrophobic region may function as a signal peptide . the hydrophobic region could play a role in _LOCATION_ anchoring . we further investigated the possible roles of this region and these efforts are described in more detail below . no sequences similar to the full length _PROTEIN_ sequence were found in the arabidopsis database . however in arabidopsis there are three genes that encode proteins strikingly similar to the c terminal region of _PROTEIN_ . the functions of these genes are not known . we were unable to find any additional sequence homology with other known proteins or functional domains . although the function of this c terminal region is not known it is likely to play a key role in the molecular function of _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ was fused to the c terminal end of the n terminal hydrophobic region of _PROTEIN_ to allow the study of the possible roles of this n terminal region in intact cells . the construct was introduced into leaf cells by particle bombardment to allow the transient _PROTEIN_ of the fusion protein _METHOD_ . in the transformants the outlines of chloroplasts were stained strongly with green _METHOD_ in the cells _PROTEIN_ n chup _METHOD_ whereas _METHOD_ was distributed uniformly in the _LOCATION_ . the localization of n chup _METHOD_ was significantly similar to that of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which is targeted to chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ rather than to that of pt _METHOD_ a fusion of the transit peptide of the ribulose bisphosphate _PROTEIN_ small subunit and _METHOD_ that is targeted to chloroplast stroma . thus n chup _METHOD_ probably was targeted to chloroplast and _LOCATION_ envelopes in mesophyll and epidermal cells respectively . these results suggest that the n terminal region may target and anchor _PROTEIN_ in the chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ . a kb transcript was detected in wild type plants using the full length _PROTEIN_ cdna sequence and the _PROTEIN_ levels were reduced greatly in all of the mutants tested . the gene was _PROTEIN_ in cauline leaves rosette leaves _METHOD_ and inflorescences but not in roots . if the _PROTEIN_ protein plays specific roles in determining the intracellular distribution of chloroplasts it is reasonable to expect that the gene would be _PROTEIN_ in organs that contain chloroplasts . because the domain organization of _PROTEIN_ included an actin binding site we studied the binding activity of this gene product to actin . attempts to _PROTEIN_ full length _PROTEIN_ as a glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ tagged protein in escherichia coli were unsuccessful because the level of _PROTEIN_ was too low to be useful and all of the _PROTEIN_ protein became insoluble . hence we instead _PROTEIN_ a truncated form of _PROTEIN_ consisting of the putative actin binding domain as a _PROTEIN_ fusion protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ abd . the fusion protein coprecipitated with f actin _PROTEIN_ whereas the control _PROTEIN_ lacking the _PROTEIN_ domain did not _PROTEIN_ . these results demonstrate that the putative actin binding motif in _PROTEIN_ can function as an actin binding site . to visualize actin filaments wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants were transformed with a construct to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mouse talin _METHOD_ a marker for the actin _LOCATION_ in live plant cells . the actin filaments were distributed over the cell cortex even around the chloroplasts in _PROTEIN_ cells and wild type cells . there was no apparent difference between _PROTEIN_ and wild type cells in _METHOD_ of the pattern of actin filaments .
