degradation of the plant hormone cytokinin is catalyzed by cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase _PROTEIN_ enzymes . the arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes seven _PROTEIN_ proteins which differ in subcellular localization and substrate specificity . here we analyze the _PROTEIN_ gene which to the best of our knowledge has not yet been studied . gus _PROTEIN_ was detected in the vasculature the transmitting tissue and the mature embryo sac . a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein localized to the _LOCATION_ which is unique among all _PROTEIN_ family members . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants developed short early terminating primary roots with smaller apical _METHOD_ contrasting with plants overexpressing other _PROTEIN_ genes . the vascular bundles of _PROTEIN_ primary roots contained only protoxylem elements thus resembling the wol mutant of the _PROTEIN_ receptor gene . we show that _PROTEIN_ activity is required to establish the _PROTEIN_ overexpression phenotype . several cytokinin metabolites in particular cis zeatin and n _PROTEIN_ cytokinins were depleted stronger in _PROTEIN_ plants compared with plants overexpressing other _PROTEIN_ genes . interestingly enhanced protoxylem formation together with reduced primary root growth was also found in the cz deficient trna isopentenyltransferase mutant _PROTEIN_ . however different cytokinins were similarly efficient in suppressing _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ vascular phenotypes . therefore we hypothesize that the pool of _LOCATION_ cytokinins is particularly relevant in the root procambium where it mediates the differentiation of vascular tissues through _PROTEIN_ . taken together the distinct consequences of _PROTEIN_ overexpression indicate that the cellular compartmentalization of cytokinin degradation and substrate preference of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are relevant parameters that define the activities of the hormone .
the previously characterized _PROTEIN_ genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of arabidopsis were shown to be differentially _PROTEIN_ at different times in the life of the plant in specific and largely non overlapping domains . to study the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ a kb promoter region of _PROTEIN_ was used to drive the _PROTEIN_ of the gus reporter gene . in arabidopsis plants stably transformed with the _PROTEIN_ gus construct gus activity was detected at two developmental time points . first the _PROTEIN_ promoter became active about days after germination in the vasculature of roots hypocotyls and cotyledons . the activity was also detected in the vasculature of young true leaves and it became weaker as the individual leaves expanded . the _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ associated with vascular cells . no gus activity was detectable during _PROTEIN_ vegetative stages . in flowers _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ was detected in the transmitting tissue of the gynoecium prior to pollination . furthermore gus activity was observed in the mature embryo sac and its maximum activity was associated with the egg cell and the synergids . weaker activity was occasionally also detected in the central cell . _PROTEIN_ gus activity ceased after pollination and was not detectable in the developing embryo . in some lines the activity occasionally extended beyond the pollination stage and weak gus staining was detected in the developing endosperm . sequence analysis of the predicted _PROTEIN_ protein revealed no obvious n terminal targeting sequence or _LOCATION_ localization signal suggesting that it could be localized in the _LOCATION_ . to experimentally determine the subcellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein we fused green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ to the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the fusion protein under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter in stably transformed arabidopsis plants . using confocal microscopy _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected in the _LOCATION_ surrounding the central _LOCATION_ and the signal was clearly separated from the cell _LOCATION_ . the same _METHOD_ pattern was observed in control plants _PROTEIN_ the untargeted _METHOD_ . all individual transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion phenocopied the corresponding _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines demonstrating that the fusion protein was functional . to study the biological activity of _PROTEIN_ we generated and analyzed in detail transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion gene under the control of the constitutive promoter . both constructs are called _PROTEIN_ in the following unless specified otherwise . selected _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants showed enhanced _PROTEIN_ of the transgene compared with wild type plants in which _PROTEIN_ transcripts were not detectable by rna gel blot analysis . the transcript levels were significantly higher in plants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion gene compared with _PROTEIN_ suggesting stabilization of the chimeric transcript . the _PROTEIN_ activity was increased in all _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines in comparison with the wild type and correlated with the level of transgene _PROTEIN_ . in the weaker _PROTEIN_ lines _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ activity was increased about four times whereas in the strongly _PROTEIN_ line _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the increase was about fold compared with the wild type . these results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis possesses canonical cytokinin degrading enzyme activity . next we analyzed the effects of the enhanced _PROTEIN_ activity on the content of endogenous cytokinin in seedlings and compared this with the cytokinin content in wild type seedlings as well as with transgenic seedlings _PROTEIN_ other _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with different subcellular localizations and biochemical characteristics _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . this comparison may indicate the substrate preferences of the analyzed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and/or the accessibility of different cytokinin substrates for the different _PROTEIN_ enzymes . collectively _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ resulted in a reduction in the total cytokinin content compared with the wild type . the levels of most of the _PROTEIN_ cytokinin metabolites were reduced below compared with the respective metabolites in the wild type . a similar reduction in the total cytokinin content was detected in seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and a stronger reduction was detected in _PROTEIN_ plants . interestingly significant differences in the relative content of several individual cytokinin metabolites were detected among the lines _PROTEIN_ individual _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . for example the content of tzr ipr and cytokinin nucleotides in _PROTEIN_ was less reduced than in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings . in contrast cz type cytokinins and were significantly more strongly reduced in _PROTEIN_ plants suggesting a high affinity of _PROTEIN_ to these substrates or a better access to them due to the _LOCATION_ localization . the concentration of cytokinin metabolites was measured in day old seedlings of lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ as a percentage of wild type values . absolute values and statistical analysis are shown in table . tz trans zeatin cz cis zeatin ip adenine tzr tz riboside czr cz riboside ipr ip riboside tz n _PROTEIN_ cz n _PROTEIN_ ip n _PROTEIN_ tzog tz o _PROTEIN_ czog cz o _PROTEIN_ tzrp tzr phosphate czrp czr phosphate iprp ipr phosphate n.d. concentration below the detection limit . comparison of cytokinin contents between line _PROTEIN_ and the wild type is shown in table . the reduction of cytokinin content in _PROTEIN_ overexpressing seedlings resulted in specific changes in seedling morphology and development . _PROTEIN_ seedlings germinated normally and looked similar to the wild type early after germination . however the primary root did not develop any _PROTEIN_ roots and stopped growing approximately three dag at a length of about mm . this determinate root phenotype was observed in all of about independent plants harboring either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the phenotype was independent of the degree of increase in _PROTEIN_ activity indicating that a small increase in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is sufficient to cause these changes . in accordance with this it was found that the cytokinin content was reduced to a similar degree in strongly _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and weakly _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines . this root phenotype was strongly contrasting with the enhanced root elongation of plants overproducing other _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the first true leaves in _PROTEIN_ seedlings stayed small grew epinastic and displayed visible stress _METHOD_ such as yellowing and accumulation of anthocyanin suggesting poor nutrient uptake from the medium . the growth arrest of the _PROTEIN_ shoot lasted for about week until the formation of adventitious roots at the hypocotyl root junction was initiated leading to the formation of a root system and the recovery of shoot growth . during _PROTEIN_ development only _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic lines with a strongly increased _PROTEIN_ activity showed differences in shoot morphology . the size of the leaves and the plant height were slightly reduced and a few more _PROTEIN_ branches and fewer flowers were produced compared with the wild type . the primary root was studied in more detail in order to understand its determinate phenotype . microscopic analysis showed that the diameter of the _PROTEIN_ primary root as well as the size of the root meristem was strongly reduced compared with the wild type . the reduced size of the root meristem was clearly demonstrated by the reduced number of cortex cells counted in a single cell file between the quiescent center and the cell elongation zone . the size of the root meristem in the wild type increased continuously from germination until dag when about cells were established . in _PROTEIN_ roots the number of meristematic cells was comparable to the wild type directly after germination but there was no increase during the _PROTEIN_ stages . the relative cell number was clearly reduced already at three dag in the _PROTEIN_ meristem . the meristem size in _PROTEIN_ plants was reduced at six dag compared with size at three dag indicating that the differentiating meristematic cells were not replenished due to the low cell division activity in the meristem . these changes correlated temporally with the arrested root elongation . to substantiate the consequences of _PROTEIN_ overexpression for cell division we monitored the activity of a mitotic marker _PROTEIN_ gus in wild type and _PROTEIN_ root _METHOD_ . owing to a mitotic degradation signal in the protein the reporter gene visualizes only actively dividing cells at the _PROTEIN_ m phase of the cell cycle . the gus staining showed that cell division activity was already strongly reduced in the root meristem of _PROTEIN_ plants shortly after germination and it declined further at _PROTEIN_ time points . the gus activity was almost undetectable in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at dag corresponding to the reduced meristem size and cessation of root growth . further inspection of the primary root structure showed no difference with respect to overall organization of the meristem or identity of the ground tissues and quiescent center . however we observed that markedly fewer vascular cell files were present in the central cylinder of the _PROTEIN_ primary root . fuchsin staining of lignified tissues of the xylem showed clear differences in the differentiation of the xylem . the xylem axis of the wild type primary root consists of two cell types protoxylem with spiral or annular secondary cell wall _PROTEIN_ and more centrally positioned metaxylem with pitted walls . in contrast the reduced vascular cylinder in the _PROTEIN_ primary root contained only protoxylem . such an abnormal differentiation of all vascular cell files into protoxylem was previously described for the wol mutants of the _PROTEIN_ cytokinin receptor gene as well as for mutants with strong cytokinin signaling defects . this suggests that ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ strongly diminished cytokinin activity in the differentiating procambial cells . the procambial cell divisions required to generate the vascular cell files in the root are regulated by the redundant activity of the three cytokinin receptors _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . therefore only simultaneous mutation of all three genes leads to the aberrant vascular development and determinate growth . however _PROTEIN_ displays a binary mode of activity cytokinin binding promotes its kinase activity whereas in the absence of cytokinin _PROTEIN_ is a phosphatase that dephosphorylates ahp proteins and thus abbreviates cytokinin signaling . hence the wol mutation in _PROTEIN_ that abolishes cytokinin binding causes the same developmental defects as displayed by triple receptor mutants . to test whether the phosphatase activity of _PROTEIN_ might be causally involved in the establishment of the _PROTEIN_ phenotype we introgressed a loss of function allele of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ background and analyzed root development . figure shows that _PROTEIN_ almost completely suppressed the _PROTEIN_ short root phenotype . likewise loss of _PROTEIN_ function rescued the development of the vascular system _PROTEIN_ root formation and normal seedling growth . enzyme measurements showed that _PROTEIN_ activity was not significantly changed in the _PROTEIN_ background . in contrast introgression of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutant alleles in the _PROTEIN_ plants did not rescue the primary root phenotype indicating that the _PROTEIN_ activity mediated most if not all of the _PROTEIN_ phenotypic changes . this further suggests that the vascular phenotype was specifically caused by the phosphatase activity of _PROTEIN_ . to test how cytokinin activity was altered by cytokinin deficiency in _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants we compared the _PROTEIN_ of the cytokinin marker gene _PROTEIN_ gus in wild type and in _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants . in the wild type root _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ was highest in the columella root cap and procambial region of the meristem and it became progressively stronger during the time course of development . in comparison _PROTEIN_ gus activity was weaker directly after germination and at all tested time points in _PROTEIN_ roots indicating reduced cytokinin activity . furthermore _PROTEIN_ gus staining was only detectable in columella cells but it was completely missing in the procambium and vascular cylinder of _PROTEIN_ roots even after prolonged staining . provided that the reduction of the total cytokinin content in _PROTEIN_ plants was weaker than in other _PROTEIN_ overexpressers the absence of _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ in the procambium indicated a particularly strong reduction in the cytokinin content or a depletion of specific cytokinin metabolites in this tissue . the remarkably strong reduction in the concentration of several cz type cytokinins in the _PROTEIN_ background led us to test the eventual involvement of these cytokinin metabolites during root development and their possible relevance for establishing the wol like phenotype . whereas ip and tz type cytokinins are synthesized by adp/atp ipts cz cytokinins are degradation products of cis hydroxy trnas which are formed by two trna ipt enzymes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the consequences of loss of cz production in the _PROTEIN_ double mutant for plant development have not been addressed in detail . in agreement with a previous report our quantification of endogenous cytokinins showed that all cz type cytokinins except for czog were completely absent in _PROTEIN_ plants . figure shows that the elongation of the primary root was strongly reduced by about in these mutants compared with the wild type control . microscopic analysis revealed that the short root phenotype of _PROTEIN_ plants correlated with a smaller size of the root meristem which contained fewer meristematic cells than the wild type . the transition zone was positioned more distally indicating an earlier onset of cell differentiation . in comparison with the wild type _PROTEIN_ roots were markedly thinner . the formation of _PROTEIN_ roots was _PROTEIN_ by about in _PROTEIN_ plants but the _PROTEIN_ root density was not reduced . in contrast both root elongation and _PROTEIN_ root formation in _PROTEIN_ a multiple adp/atp ipt mutant with reduced ip and tz type cytokinin content were slightly increased in agreement with a previous report . next we analyzed whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are also required for the correct differentiation of root vascular tissue . histological studies revealed that the pattern of differentiation was altered in _PROTEIN_ roots with extra protoxylem cell files being frequently established . two continuous protoxylem cell files were typically observed in wild type roots and only sporadically short stretches of extra protoxylem were observed . this pattern of differentiation was altered in _PROTEIN_ roots which established one to four ectopic protoxylem cell files in of cases . these cell files were often extended over a longer distance . similarly ectopic development of one or two protoxylem files was observed in the double cytokinin receptor mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with frequency . notwithstanding the apparent similarity there were subtle differences between the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants . first although the frequency of ectopic protoxylem formation per plant was higher in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ than in _PROTEIN_ the number of ectopic protoxylem files was often lower _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . secondly whereas the ectopic protoxylem file often continued over a long distance or even the entire root length in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the ectopic protoxylem formation was more _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ . the highest number of extra protoxylem files was often observed close to the root tip in the differentiation zone . these files continued over a certain distance but were eventually terminated and the protoxylem/metaxylem pattern was partially normalized . importantly there was no difference in protoxylem development in _PROTEIN_ roots supporting the hypothesis that protoxylem differentiation in the root procambium could be predominantly controlled by trna ipts . to test if the reduction of specific cytokinin metabolites is causally linked to developmental changes in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants different cytokinins were tested for their capability to complement these changes . the elongation of primary roots in _PROTEIN_ plants could be weakly and to a similar extend complemented by the highest concentrations of cz tz and benzyladenine . however the primary root length was still very short in comparison with the wild type . in contrast figure shows that the root vascular phenotype in _PROTEIN_ was fully rescued by exogenous cytokinin as the number of protoxylem cell files was suppressed and the formation of metaxylem restored in a dose dependent manner . both zeatin isomers could suppress the wol like vascular pattern however tz was more effective already at lower concentrations compared with cz . in _PROTEIN_ plants all tested cytokinins had only a small effect on primary root elongation at lower concentrations the highest tested concentration had an inhibitory effect . however ectopic protoxylem formation in _PROTEIN_ plants was suppressed by low cytokinin concentrations . interestingly in the cz deficient _PROTEIN_ mutant tz was also effective in suppressing ectopic protoxylem formation at even lower concentrations than cz . these results suggest that at least in the case of regulation of vascular development in the arabidopsis root cz and tz have similar activities .
the _PROTEIN_ gene was amplified from genomic dna of arabidopsis thaliana columbia with the dna polymerase bio x act long using the oligonucleotides fw and rev . the resulting gene fragment was cloned into _PROTEIN_ topo generating _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the gene sequence was verified by sequencing and subcloned in the kpni and sali sites of pbinhygtx downstream of the promoter . to generate the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion gene the _PROTEIN_ gene was amplified from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ using the oligonucleotides fw and _PROTEIN_ stop/xhoi rev which mutated the stop codon into a serin codon . the kpni/xhoi fragment was subcloned in the vector _METHOD_ creating the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion gene under control of the promoter . a kb promoter fragment of _PROTEIN_ was amplified by pcr using the oligonucleotides fw and rev . the resulting fragment was cloned into the smai site of pbluescript ii sk sequenced and subsequently subcloned into the smai site of the binary vector pgptv bar upstream of the uida reporter gene . the binary vectors were transformed via agrobacterium tumefaciens into a. thaliana col according to the standard protocol . primary transformants were selected on half strength _METHOD_ medium containing sucrose and supplemented either with mg hygromycin b for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants or with mg phosphinotricin for _PROTEIN_ gus transformants . _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ gus and _METHOD_ transgenic plants were described previously as well as lines _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion mutant line _PROTEIN_ was kindly provided by t. kakimoto . plants were grown in the greenhouse on soil and in vitro at under long day conditions . for in vitro assays seeds were surface sterilized and cold treated at for days in the dark and then exposed to white light . seedlings were grown on plates containing half strength _METHOD_ medium with sucrose . total rna was extracted from day old seedlings grown in vitro and rna gel blot analysis was performed as described . radioactive labelled dna probe corresponding to _PROTEIN_ cdna was prepared using the prime it ii random primer labeling kit . a phosphor imager was used for signal detection . the gus _PROTEIN_ analysis was carried out as described previously . for microscopic inspection tissues were cleared as described . staining was observed with a stereomicroscope or a microscope . similar gus activity patterns were detected in several independent transgenic lines harboring the _PROTEIN_ gus construct . for microscopic inspection of root _METHOD_ seedlings were fixed in a mixture of acetic acid and ethanol for h at room temperature and cleared with chloralhydrate glycerol for h at room temperature . the length of the cortical cells was measured from microscopy pictures using scion image software . lignified xylem tissue was stained as described previously . seedlings were incubated in basic fuchsin for min at room temperature and if necessary destained at room temperature in ethanol . fuchsin and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was analyzed by confocal microscopy using the nm line of the argon laser for excitation . emission was recorded between and nm and and nm respectively . the enzymatic activity of _PROTEIN_ in plant material was measured using a modified end point method . the reactions were set up as described in galuszka et al . using ml of plant extract and mm ip as a substrate . reactions were incubated at for h. the concentration of the produced schiff base was determined using the molar absorption coefficient and _PROTEIN_ as the amount of cleaved ip per total protein and reaction time . each sample contained about g of day old seedlings grown in vitro . three independent biological replicates were analysed for each genotype . extraction purification and quantification of endogenous cytokinins was performed according to the method described by et al . including the modification described in riefler et al . .
