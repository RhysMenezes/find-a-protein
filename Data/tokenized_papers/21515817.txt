proteins localized to various cellular and subcellular _LOCATION_ play pivotal roles in numerous cellular activities . accordingly in eukaryotic cells the biogenesis of organellar proteins is an essential process requiring their correct localization among various cellular and subcellular _LOCATION_ . localization of these proteins is determined by either cotranslational or posttranslational _METHOD_ depending on the final destination . however it is not fully understood how the targeting specificity of _LOCATION_ proteins is determined in plant cells . here we investigate the mechanism by which signal anchored proteins are differentially targeted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or endosymbiotic organelles using in vivo targeting subcellular fractionation and bioinformatics approaches . for targeting sa proteins to endosymbiotic organelles the c terminal positively charged region flanking the transmembrane domain is necessary but not sufficient . the hydrophobicity of the tmd in cpr containing proteins also plays a critical role in determining targeting specificity tmds with a hydrophobicity value > on the wimley and white scale are targeted primarily to the _LOCATION_ whereas tmds with lower values are targeted to endosymbiotic organelles . based on these data we propose that the cpr and the hydrophobicity of the tmd play a critical role in determining the targeting specificity between the _LOCATION_ and endosymbiotic organelles .
to gain insight into the mechanism by which sa proteins are specifically delivered to chloroplasts and mitochondria we compared sequences of oem proteins from arabidopsis thaliana chloroplasts or mitochondria . a common feature of these sequences is positively charged amino acid residues lys and arg in the c terminal flanking region of the tmd . in previous studies the cpr of the tmd has been shown to play a critical role in the targeting of sa proteins to the chloroplast oem . in addition a mitochondrial protein _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis also contained the cpr similar to chloroplast oem proteins in plant cells and mitochondrial oem proteins found in animal cells . therefore we hypothesized that the cpr plays a critical role in the targeting of sa proteins to both chloroplast and mitochondrial _METHOD_ . however the amino acid sequences of the cprs vary greatly depending on the individual proteins . based on chloroplast and mitochondrial oem proteins we defined the cpr as a region that contains at least three positively charged amino acid residues consisting of lys and/or arg residues within eight amino acid residues of the c terminal end of a tmd . next we examined whether the cpr is sufficient for targeting a sa protein to the endosymbiotic organelles . recently a large number of _LOCATION_ proteins have been identified from various organelles by proteomics . close examination of these proteins revealed that a large number of _LOCATION_ targeted _LOCATION_ proteins also contain the cpr flanking their tmds . this observation raised the question of how the targeting specificity of cpr containing sa proteins between the _LOCATION_ and endosymbiotic organelles is determined . sa proteins without the cpr are likely targeted to the _LOCATION_ . consistent with this idea two putative sa proteins without the cpr were targeted to the _LOCATION_ when _PROTEIN_ as green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion proteins . in _LOCATION_ proteins positive charges around the tmd play a role in determining the topology of _LOCATION_ proteins as summarized by the positive inside rule . thus these results raise the possibility that the cpr is necessary but insufficient alone for specific targeting of sa proteins to endosymbiotic organelles in plant cells . additional sequence information appears to be needed . we sought to confirm this by in vivo targeting experiments with _LOCATION_ proteins _GENE_ _GENE_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ which each have a cpr next to the tmd and generated _METHOD_ fusion constructs _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ using n terminal segments containing the tmd and cpr of these proteins . the _METHOD_ fusion constructs were introduced into arabidopsis protoplasts and their localizations were examined via a _METHOD_ microscopy . indeed these _METHOD_ fusion proteins each produced an _LOCATION_ localization pattern . this indicated that the presence of the cpr is not sufficient to determine targeting specificity to endosymbiotic organelles and that additional _PROTEIN_ are required . however despite the apparent similarity between the cprs of _LOCATION_ and endosymbiotic organellar proteins the cpr of _LOCATION_ proteins does not play a role in _PROTEIN_ evasion as observed for the cpr of mitochondrial proteins . thus another possibility is that cprs differ functionally from each other . to distinguish between the two possibilities we examined the targeting of mutant _LOCATION_ and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase _PROTEIN_ and endosymbiotic proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with swapped cpr domains . the chloroplast protein mutants _PROTEIN_ cpr and _PROTEIN_ cpr _PROTEIN_ with the cprs of _LOCATION_ proteins _GENE_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively were targeted to chloroplasts with a minor portion being targeted to mitochondria . similarly the mitochondrial protein mutants _PROTEIN_ cpr and _PROTEIN_ cpr _PROTEIN_ with the cprs of the _LOCATION_ proteins _GENE_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively were targeted to mitochondria . furthermore four _LOCATION_ protein mutants _GENE_ cpr _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ cpr _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cpr _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cpr _PROTEIN_ that had the cpr of either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ were properly targeted to the _LOCATION_ . these results support the idea that the cpr is necessary but not sufficient to determine the targeting specificity between the _LOCATION_ and endosymbiotic organelles and that additional _PROTEIN_ are required . the results shown in figure and supplemental figure online strongly suggest that an additional _PROTEIN_ is necessary for targeting specificity of cpr containing sa proteins . one possibility is that the hydrophobicity of the tmd influences the targeting specificity of c sa proteins between the _LOCATION_ and endosymbiotic organelles . in animal cells mitochondrial proteins tend to have a tmd with moderate hydrophobicity . accordingly we examined the hydrophobicity of tmds of _LOCATION_ chloroplast and mitochondrial proteins . we focused only on proteins that had a tmd within the n terminal amino acid residues and excluded ones with a signal anchor positioned after larger n terminal domains . the _PROTEIN_ database which provides proteomics data for protein localizations was searched for candidate proteins and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins and endosymbiotic organellar _LOCATION_ proteins were found . then the hydrophobicity of the n terminal tmds between these two groups was compared using the kyte and doolittle hydrophobicity scale . the hydrophobicity values of the tmd of the _LOCATION_ and endosymbiotic proteins range from to and to with average hydrophobicity values of and respectively . the majority of _LOCATION_ sa proteins had a hydrophobicity value > on the kd hydrophobicity scale whereas of endosymbiotic organellar sa proteins had a hydrophobicity value < on the kd hydrophobicity scale . however the hydrophobicity values of _LOCATION_ targeted sa proteins significantly overlapped with those of endosymbiotic sa proteins . many different methods for determining hydrophobicity have been proposed . therefore we explored whether other methods provide better differentiation of hydrophobicity of the tmd between _LOCATION_ and endosymbiotic organellar sa proteins . we reexamined the hydrophobicity of the _LOCATION_ and endosymbiotic organellar sa proteins listed in supplemental table online using wimley and white and engelman _PROTEIN_ hydrophobicity scales . with the ww hydrophobicity scale the majority of the _LOCATION_ targeted sa proteins had a hydrophobicity value > whereas the majority of the endosymbiotic organellar sa proteins had a hydrophobicity value < indicating that although there was still a certain degree of overlap between _LOCATION_ and endosymbiotic organellar targeted sa proteins the ww hydrophobicity scale provided better differentiation between _LOCATION_ and endosymbiotic sa proteins . by contrast the _PROTEIN_ hydrophobicity scale produced poor differentiation in this _PROTEIN_ . this result suggested that tmds with a hydrophobicity value > on the ww hydrophobicity scale are targeted to the _LOCATION_ whereas tmds with lower values are targeted to endosymbiotic organelles . given the results shown in figure and supplemental figure online we next sought to confirm the localization of c sa proteins listed in supplemental table online by in vivo targeting experiments . we selected several proteins containing highly hydrophobic tmds from the list in supplemental table online . the n terminal region containing their tmd and cpr was fused to _METHOD_ and the resulting _GENE_ _METHOD_ _GENE_ _METHOD_ and _GENE_ _METHOD_ constructs were transformed into protoplasts from arabidopsis leaf tissues . localization of these fusion proteins was examined by _METHOD_ microscopy . _GENE_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ which were listed as chloroplast proteins produced a _LOCATION_ pattern or an _LOCATION_ pattern when their n terminal regions were fused to _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts . to test if this difference in localization was caused by the n terminal fragment containing the tmd and cpr the full length proteins were fused to _METHOD_ and their localizations were examined in protoplasts . the full length fusion proteins _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were also localized in the _LOCATION_ or targeted to the _LOCATION_ strongly suggesting that _GENE_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ are _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ proteins . to define the determinants of c sa protein targeting to the _LOCATION_ or endosymbiotic organelles we decided to include only proteins whose localizations had been confirmed by in vivo targeting experiments . however there were only a limited number of plant c sa proteins whose localizations had been confirmed . thus reliable sequence information for differential targeting of c sa proteins between _LOCATION_ and endosymbiotic organelles could not be easily obtained . accordingly we performed a genome wide analysis of arabidopsis c sa proteins combining computational and experimental approaches . through a computational pipeline including tmd predictions using conpred ii the exclusion of signal sequence containing _LOCATION_ luminal proteins using spoctopus and the detection of cprs based on a custom script we obtained putative _LOCATION_ proteins that have an n terminal tmd sequence with a cpr . from the putative _LOCATION_ proteins identified we selected proteins whose localizations were not confirmed by in vivo targeting experiments we then determined their localizations by in vivo targeting experiments in protoplasts using _METHOD_ fusion constructs generated with the n terminal region containing the tmd and cpr . the _METHOD_ fusion constructs were cotransformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ which is a fusion protein consisting of _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ that is targeted to the chloroplast oem . the localizations of these fusion proteins were examined under a _METHOD_ microscope . the localization of reporter proteins to mitochondria was confirmed by colocalization with mitotracker . initially we examined the targeting specificity of the n terminal tmd and cpr of proteins _GENE_ _GENE_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ whose tmds have ww hydrophobicity values of and respectively . the _METHOD_ fusion proteins _GENE_ _METHOD_ _GENE_ _METHOD_ _GENE_ _METHOD_ and _GENE_ _METHOD_ were targeted to the _LOCATION_ . in addition we examined the targeting specificity of the n terminal tmd and cpr of proteins _GENE_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ that had tmds with ww hydrophobicity values ranging from to . these _METHOD_ fusion proteins each produced a _PROTEIN_ pattern surrounding the chloroplasts and overlapped closely with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . fusion proteins generated from _GENE_ and _GENE_ in which the tmd also displayed ww hydrophobicity values below produced punctate staining patterns that also stained with mitotracker . to confirm the _PROTEIN_ of these fusion proteins protein extracts from the protoplasts were subjected to immunoblot analysis using an anti _METHOD_ antibody . except for _GENE_ _METHOD_ figure showed that all _METHOD_ proteins with a hydrophobicity value > on the ww hydrophobicity scale were targeted to the _LOCATION_ otherwise targeting was to endosymbiotic organelles . to expand our findings we examined the localizations of additional _METHOD_ fusion constructs with the n terminal tmds and cprs of other c sa proteins in in vivo targeting experiments . in addition for some representative proteins we examined the localizations of full length _METHOD_ fusion proteins to determine whether the n terminal tmd and cpr are sufficient to determine targeting specificity . tables and summarize the in vivo targeting results for all proteins examined in this study together with seven sa proteins that had been confirmed previously in other studies . hydrophobicity analysis of _LOCATION_ targeted sa proteins confirmed by in vivo targeting hydrophobicity analysis of chloroplast and mitochondrial sa proteins confirmed by in vivo targeting using this new data set we analyzed again the hydrophobicity of tmds using the kd ww and _PROTEIN_ hydrophobicity scales to see if there was any distinction in the hydrophobicity of tmds between _LOCATION_ and endosymbiotic organellar c sa proteins . again the ww hydrophobicity scale produced much better differentiation in tmd hydrophobicity values between _LOCATION_ and endosymbiotic organellar c sa proteins . among the c sa proteins we analyzed of _LOCATION_ c sa proteins had a ww hydrophobicity value above whereas of endosymbiotic organellar c sa proteins had a ww hydrophobicity value below raising the possibility that the hydrophobicity value of could be an important criterion for distinguishing the localizations of _LOCATION_ and endosymbiotic c sa proteins . in mammals and yeast mitochondria targeted sa proteins have lower hydrophobicity values than do _LOCATION_ targeted proteins . to test this idea further we analyzed c sa proteins screened from the database using the ww hydrophobicity scale . figure shows the distribution pattern of c sa proteins according to hydrophobicity value . proteins that have hydrophobicity values between and were underrepresented thus separating total c sa proteins into two groups delimited by the hydrophobicity value of . the group of proteins that have hydrophobicity values above may be targeted to the _LOCATION_ and the group of proteins that have hydrophobicity values below may be targeted to endosymbiotic organelles . this result supports the idea that the hydrophobicity value of may be an important criterion for distinguishing the localization of c sa proteins . however the hydrophobicity of the tmd did not differ between chloroplast and mitochondrial sa proteins . the average hydrophobicity values of _LOCATION_ and endosymbiotic organellar c sa proteins were and respectively . in this new data set of _LOCATION_ targeted c sa proteins had tmd hydrophobicity values > on the ww hydrophobicity scale and of endosymbiotic organellar c sa proteins had values < . the lack of complete differentiation between groups suggests that _PROTEIN_ in addition to hydrophobicity are involved in determining targeting specificity to the _LOCATION_ or endosymbiotic organelles . to confirm experimentally that the hydrophobicity of the tmd is critical in determining target specificity we selected _GENE_ an _LOCATION_ targeted c sa protein and gradually lowered the hydrophobicity of the tmd by substituting one two or three ala residues for trp alone trp and leu or trp leu and ile in the tmd respectively . the tmds of _GENE_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ had ww hydrophobicity values of and respectively which were lower than the for the wild type tmd . n terminal fragments containing the tmd and cpr of wild type _GENE_ and the three substitution mutants were fused to _METHOD_ to generate _GENE_ _METHOD_ _GENE_ _METHOD_ _GENE_ _METHOD_ and _GENE_ _METHOD_ respectively . these constructs were introduced into protoplasts together with bip _METHOD_ a chimeric _LOCATION_ marker protein in which bip and _METHOD_ are fused or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ by polyethylene glycol mediated transformation or into intact leaf tissues by agroinfiltration . subsequently these transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins were examined via _METHOD_ microscopy . _GENE_ _METHOD_ produced an _LOCATION_ pattern in both protoplasts and intact cells in infiltrated leaf tissues . in addition _GENE_ _METHOD_ that had a trp to ala substitution still produced the _LOCATION_ pattern . however the other two mutants _GENE_ _METHOD_ and _GENE_ _METHOD_ produced new _METHOD_ patterns _GENE_ _METHOD_ produced the _LOCATION_ pattern together with a mitochondrial pattern and _METHOD_ produced the mitochondrial pattern together with a chloroplast pattern . the mitochondrial localization of the _METHOD_ fusion proteins generated from _GENE_ and _GENE_ was confirmed by colocalization with mitotracker staining . to test whether the cprs of these mutants played a role in their targeting to mitochondria we examined the localization of a new mutant _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ generated by substituting the cpr from _GENE_ _METHOD_ with gly residues . it was targeted to the _LOCATION_ instead of mitochondria/chloroplasts . these results indicate that a _PROTEIN_ in the hydrophobicity of the tmd in _LOCATION_ targeted c sa proteins is sufficient for the targeting of these proteins to endosymbiotic organelles instead of the _LOCATION_ . the results are consistent with the hypothesis that the hydrophobicity of the tmd plays a critical role in determining the targeting specificity of c sa proteins to the _LOCATION_ or endosymbiotic organelles . next we confirmed the image analysis results at the biochemical level using immnuoblot analysis . to demonstrate more clearly the change in targeting specificity between the _LOCATION_ and endosymbiotic organelles we used the n glycosylation that occurs at the _LOCATION_ and thus can be used as evidence for the _LOCATION_ localization . we generated _GENE_ _METHOD_ _GENE_ _METHOD_ _GENE_ _METHOD_ _GENE_ _METHOD_ and _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ by adding two glycosylation sites to their corresponding constructs one at the n terminus of _GENE_ and the other at the c terminus of the _METHOD_ respectively . the modifications did not change the localization patterns . protein extracts from the transformed protoplasts that had been incubated with or without tunicamycin an inhibitor of n glycosylation were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti _METHOD_ antibody . _GENE_ _METHOD_ from tunicamycin treated protoplasts migrated faster than that from untreated protoplasts indicating that _GENE_ _METHOD_ is n glycosylated and thus targeted to the _LOCATION_ . comparison of the n glycosylation of wild type and mutant _METHOD_ of _GENE_ _METHOD_ showed that the wild type _GENE_ _METHOD_ and _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were fully n glycosylated . by contrast and of _GENE_ _METHOD_ and _GENE_ _METHOD_ proteins were detected as the unglycosylated form respectively confirming the data obtained with image analysis . to obtain independent evidence for the localization of these _METHOD_ reporter proteins we analyzed subcellular fractions containing the _LOCATION_ chloroplasts or mitochondria by immunoblot analysis using antibodies directed against _METHOD_ and organelle markers . anti anti calreticulin and anti porin antibodies were used for chloroplasts _LOCATION_ and mitochondria respectively . consistent with the results of the image and glycosylation pattern analyses the unglycosylated form of _GENE_ _METHOD_ was detected primarily in the chloroplast fraction although a small portion was also detected in the mitochondrial fraction . on the other hand glycosylated _METHOD_ of _GENE_ _METHOD_ and _GENE_ _METHOD_ were detected primarily in the _LOCATION_ fraction with barely any detection of these proteins in the chloroplast and mitochondrial fractions . to get a clue whether this is a general phenomenon in targeting specificity determination we selected another _LOCATION_ targeted c sa protein _GENE_ and examined whether its localization switches from the _LOCATION_ to endosymbiotic organelles depending on the hydrophobicity of tmd . the hydrophobicity was lowered by substituting two ala for two phe residues or two ala for two leu residues subsequently the n terminal tmd and cpr of the wild type and mutants was fused to _METHOD_ to give _GENE_ _METHOD_ _GENE_ _METHOD_ and _GENE_ _METHOD_ . the wild type _GENE_ _METHOD_ produced an _LOCATION_ pattern . however the mutants _GENE_ _METHOD_ and _GENE_ _METHOD_ produced a pattern indicating that the major portion of these proteins is targeted to chloroplasts with a minor portion to the _LOCATION_ . as a control we generated two additional tmd mutants _GENE_ had a substitution of two leu residues for phe residues and _GENE_ had a shuffling of two phe residues in the tmd and cpr . the substitution of phe to leu caused a minor _PROTEIN_ in hydrophobicity from to on the ww hydrophobicity scale . the substitution mutants were fused to _METHOD_ and introduced into protoplasts . as expected both _GENE_ _METHOD_ and _GENE_ _METHOD_ produced an _LOCATION_ pattern as observed with the wild type sequence confirming that the hydrophobicity of tmd rather than the position or presence of phe residues is a critical determinant of targeting specificity . similar results were obtained with _GENE_ . when ala was substituted for leu or ile hydrophobicity was reduced to or from on the ww hydrophobicity scale respectively and targeting was changed from the _LOCATION_ to chloroplasts . next we tested whether a mitochondrial _LOCATION_ protein can be rerouted to the _LOCATION_ by increasing the hydrophobicity of tmd . we selected _GENE_ a mitochondrial c sa protein . the n terminal region of _GENE_ that contained the tmd and the cpr was fused to _METHOD_ and the resulting construct _GENE_ _METHOD_ was introduced into protoplasts by peg mediated transformation or into leaf tissues by agroinfiltration . _GENE_ _METHOD_ produced a punctate staining pattern that closely overlapped with that of mitotracker indicating that _GENE_ _METHOD_ is targeted to mitochondria . next we generated three mutants _GENE_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ which had in the tmd substitutions of and that resulted in hydrophobicity values of and respectively on the ww hydrophobicity scale . the resulting mutants were introduced into protoplasts as _METHOD_ fusion constructs and localization was examined under a _METHOD_ microscope . transformed protoplasts were also stained with mitotracker to locate mitochondria . _GENE_ _METHOD_ still produced the punctate staining pattern that closely overlapped with mitotracker . however _GENE_ _METHOD_ and _GENE_ _METHOD_ produced an _LOCATION_ pattern that did not overlap with mitotracker . in addition _GENE_ _METHOD_ produced a punctate staining pattern that was not stained with mitotracker raising the possibility that _GENE_ _METHOD_ is targeted to the _LOCATION_ apparatus or other endomembrane compartments by vesicle trafficking . to confirm that the _LOCATION_ pattern represented the _LOCATION_ the three mutants of _GENE_ _METHOD_ were introduced into protoplasts together with bip _METHOD_ and their localization was examined . figure shows that both _GENE_ _METHOD_ and _GENE_ _METHOD_ closely overlapped with bip _METHOD_ confirming that _GENE_ _METHOD_ and _GENE_ _METHOD_ localize to the _LOCATION_ . in addition _GENE_ _METHOD_ also showed an _LOCATION_ pattern in intact cells of infiltrated leaf tissues confirming the _LOCATION_ localization of _GENE_ _METHOD_ . to test the importance of the cpr in the mitochondrial targeting of these proteins we generated a new mutant _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ that had a gly substitution in its cpr . instead of being targeted to mitochondria it was targeted to the _LOCATION_ confirming that the cpr is necessary for mitochondrial targeting . to confirm this further at the biochemical level we performed immunoblot analysis using proteins from transformed protoplasts . again two n glycosylation sites were introduced into the _METHOD_ fusion constructs one at the n terminus of _GENE_ and the other at the c terminus of _METHOD_ . the modifications did not change the localization patterns . protoplasts were transformed with these modified constructs and incubated in the presence or absence of tunicamycin . protein extracts from the transformed protoplasts were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti _METHOD_ antibody . the upper and lower bands indicated n glycosylated and unglycosylated reporter proteins that were targeted to the _LOCATION_ and endosymbiotic organelles respectively . consistent with image analysis the amount of the upper band gradually increased with increasing hydrophobicity . to obtain supporting data for the localization of reporter proteins we performed immunoblot analysis of subcellular fractions using antibodies directed against _METHOD_ and organelle markers . consistent with the localization data of image and glycosylation pattern analyses _GENE_ _METHOD_ and _GENE_ _METHOD_ proteins were detected primarily in the mitochondria and the _LOCATION_ fraction respectively . next we tested whether a chloroplast c sa protein can also be targeted to the _LOCATION_ by increasing the hydrophobicity of the tmd . _GENE_ having a tmd with a hydrophobicity value of on the ww hydrophobicity scale was targeted to chloroplasts when _PROTEIN_ as a _METHOD_ fusion protein . the tmd hydrophobicity of _GENE_ was increased by substituting one or two leu residues for one or two ala residues respectively . in addition to test the importance of the cpr in chloroplast targeting _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ was generated by substituting its cpr with three gly residues . _METHOD_ fusion protein constructs generated using the n terminal tmd and cpr of the wild type and mutants of _GENE_ were introduced into protoplasts together with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or bip _METHOD_ and localization of these proteins was examined . _GENE_ _METHOD_ with only one leu substitution for ala and with a tmd hydrophobicity value of on the ww hydrophobicity scale produced both chloroplast and _LOCATION_ patterns . in addition _GENE_ _METHOD_ with a substitution of two leu for ala residues and with a tmd hydrophobicity value of on the ww hydrophobicity scale primarily produced the _LOCATION_ pattern again confirming that the hydrophobicity is critical for targeting specificity of sa proteins . by contrast _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ produced the _LOCATION_ pattern confirming that the cpr is also necessary for chloroplast targeting of the wild type protein . consistent with the results obtained with protoplasts _GENE_ _METHOD_ and _GENE_ _METHOD_ showed chloroplast and _LOCATION_ localization patterns respectively in the intact cells of agroinfiltrated leaf tissues . to confirm the results obtained from image analysis at the biochemical level we fused the n terminal regions of the wild type and mutants of _GENE_ to _METHOD_ that had an n glycosylation site at the c terminus of _METHOD_ and the resulting constructs were introduced into protoplasts . the transformed protoplasts were incubated in the presence or absence of tunicamycin and protein extracts from the transformed protoplasts were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti _METHOD_ antibody . as expected the chloroplast targeted wild type protein did not produce the glycosylated form . however the amount of the glycosylated form increased gradually with increasing hydrophobicity confirming that increased hydrophobicity causes _LOCATION_ targeting . in addition _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with a substitution of gly residues for its cpr resulted in n glycosylation confirming that the cpr is important for evading _LOCATION_ targeting . next to obtain supporting data for the localization of reporter proteins we analyzed subcellular fractions containing chloroplasts by immunoblot analysis using antibodies directed against _METHOD_ and organelle markers . unglycosylated _GENE_ _METHOD_ and _GENE_ _METHOD_ were detected in the chloroplast fraction . by contrast the n glycosylated form of _GENE_ _METHOD_ was not detected in the chloroplast fraction confirming the localization data from the image and glycosylation pattern analyses . next we examined whether the _PROTEIN_ is involved in the _LOCATION_ targeting of chloroplast and mitochondrial c sa protein mutants that had increased hydrophobicity values in their tmds . the _PROTEIN_ is known to recognize the hydrophobic tmd for the targeting of _LOCATION_ proteins . to test _PROTEIN_ binding to tmds of c sa proteins we used an in vitro transcription translation coupled system . _METHOD_ fusion constructs _GENE_ _METHOD_ _GENE_ _METHOD_ _GENE_ _METHOD_ _GENE_ _METHOD_ _GENE_ _METHOD_ and _GENE_ _METHOD_ were truncated so that they would produce polypeptides of n terminal to amino acid residues that contain only the tmd cpr and the first amino acid residues of _METHOD_ . the truncated constructs were translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysates . since the truncated constructs had no termination codon ribosomes could not be released from the nascent polypeptide but instead remained stalled at the end of polypeptide . ribosome/mrna/nascent polypeptide complexes were precipitated by ultracentrifugation . the presence of the _PROTEIN_ in the precipitates was determined by rt pcr using rna specific primers . since rna is one of the major _PROTEIN_ components it can be conveniently used to examine for the presence of the _PROTEIN_ . samples without any dna or with bip _METHOD_ encoding an _LOCATION_ luminal protein were included as negative and positive controls respectively . rna was only detected weakly in the sample without dna which likely resulted from the weak binding affinity of the _PROTEIN_ for ribosomes . by contrast bip _METHOD_ produced a much stronger signal confirming the enhanced interaction between the _PROTEIN_ and bip _METHOD_ . a hydrophobic leader sequence in the nascent polypeptide increases the _PROTEIN_ binding affinity for the ribosome and the _PROTEIN_ also binds to the hydrophobic leader sequence resulting in enhanced binding of the _PROTEIN_ to the rnc . next we compared the rna intensity in the precipitates of samples containing _LOCATION_ and endosymbiotic targeted versions of _METHOD_ fusion proteins . _LOCATION_ targeted _METHOD_ fusion proteins _GENE_ _METHOD_ _GENE_ _METHOD_ and _GENE_ _METHOD_ showed stronger rna signals than did their chloroplast/mitochondria targeted counterparts _GENE_ _METHOD_ _GENE_ _METHOD_ and _GENE_ _METHOD_ respectively . these results indicate that increasing the tmd hydrophobicity value > in mitochondrial and chloroplast c sas causes _PROTEIN_ binding and the _LOCATION_ targeting of _METHOD_ fusion proteins .
arabidopsis thaliana was cultivated on gamborg plates under conditions of relative humidity and a h h dark cycle in a growth chamber . leaf tissues of to week old plants were used to isolate protoplasts . dna fragments encoding a putative signal anchor region of _LOCATION_ proteins were amplified from arabidopsis genomic dna or cdna by pcr using specific primers . all sequences of the primers are described in supplemental table online . the pcr products were digested with restriction enzymes and ligated into a puc _METHOD_ vector containing the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter _METHOD_ and nos terminator in such a way that the n terminal signal anchor region was fused in frame to the n terminus of _METHOD_ . for in vitro transcription/translation coupled reactions _METHOD_ fusion protein constructs _GENE_ _METHOD_ _GENE_ _METHOD_ _GENE_ _METHOD_ _GENE_ _METHOD_ _GENE_ _METHOD_ _GENE_ _METHOD_ and bip _METHOD_ were digested with xhoi/ecori restriction enzymes and ligated into pbluescript ii sk . for generating site specific amino acid substitution mutants each pair of complementary upper and lower primers of which the central regions were mutated according to the replaced amino acid residues were designed . in the first round of pcr upper and lower pcr products were obtained with each primer set of the upper/nos and the pro respectively _METHOD_ . in the second round of pcr the upper/lower pcr products were used as templates and mutated pcr products were amplified using the se/nos primer set _METHOD_ . to induce n glycosylation of sa proteins in the _LOCATION_ lumen a consensus n glycosylation sequence was introduced at the n terminal region of each sa protein or at the c terminal region of the _METHOD_ . the asn of each n glycosylation sequence was flanked by a single lys or arg residue to be more accessible to oligosaccharidyl transferase . to generate the puc _METHOD_ glyc vector that had an n glycosylation site at the c terminus the _METHOD_ dna fragment was amplified using the primer set of _METHOD_ n gly r. the pcr product was digested with xbai/noti restriction enzymes and ligated into the puc vector . the n terminal n glycosylation site was introduced by pcr using primers _GENE_ n gly f/nos for _GENE_ and its mutant constructs and _GENE_ n gly f/nos for _GENE_ and its mutants . the pcr products were digested with xhoi/bamhi and ligated into the puc _METHOD_ glyc vector . the nucleotide sequence of all the pcr products was confirmed by sequencing . to select c sa _LOCATION_ proteins rather than luminal proteins a two step approach was devised using conpred ii and spoctopus _METHOD_ . in the first step through conpred ii transmembrane domain profiles of protein sequences were obtained and among them _LOCATION_ proteins that have a transmembrane domain within the n terminal amino acid residues were selected . in the second step putative _LOCATION_ proteins were reanalyzed with spoctopus to remove _LOCATION_ signal sequence containing proteins which are often confused with sa proteins by transmembrane domain predictors . the tmd was determined by algorithm spoctopus . to obtain sa proteins listed in figure and supplemental table online we selected them from among proteins whose localizations were inferred by _METHOD_ or tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ assays from the _PROTEIN_ database using a two step approach with and without the cpr criterion respectively . in the case of supplemental table online we used protein sequences downloaded from the swiss prot/trembl database for the c sa protein screening . to measure the hydrophobicity of the tmd of each protein the mean hydrophobicity of amino acid residues was calculated in order from the n terminus and the highest value was taken to represent the hydrophobicity of each tmd . three different hydrophobicity scales _PROTEIN_ were used to calculate hydrophobicity . all dna plasmids were purified with qiagen plasmid purification kits . arabidopsis protoplasts were prepared from leaf tissues and purified dna plasmids were introduced into protoplasts by peg mediated transformation following previous studies . after a to h incubation at in a growth chamber transformed protoplasts were observed with a microscope or sampled for immunoblot analysis . for the mitotracker staining transformed protoplasts were incubated in medium _PROTEIN_ containing nm mitotracker for min at room temperature in the dark . stained protoplasts were washed two times with fresh medium and observed with a microscope after a h incubation at in the dark . to examine the glycosylation pattern of _METHOD_ fusion proteins transformed protoplasts were incubated with or without tunicamycin for h in the dark . the preparation of protein extracts from transformed protoplasts followed previous methods . protoplasts were collected in an e tube and incubation solution was removed by quick centrifugation . after discarding the incubation solution protoplasts were lysed by vortexing in denaturation buffer _PROTEIN_ and sampling buffer _PROTEIN_ . the lysed sample was boiled for min and centrifuged at and to remove cell debris . proteins were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride _LOCATION_ using protein electrophoresis and blotting apparatuses . protein blots were developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit and visualized using the _PROTEIN_ image capture system _PROTEIN_ . anti _METHOD_ anti crt anti porin and anti antibodies were used as described previously . subcellular fractions containing chloroplasts mitochondria or the _LOCATION_ were obtained from protoplasts by modified fractionation protocols . transformed protoplasts were resuspended in ml _METHOD_ buffer and filtered gently three times through two layers of nylon net filters for homogenization . to obtain subcellular fractions containing chloroplasts the homogenate was incubated on ice for min after the addition of mm edta . after the incubation the homogenate was loaded onto ml of percoll in _METHOD_ buffer and centrifuged at at for min . intact chloroplasts formed a loose pellet at the base of the tube . the upper fraction was removed carefully with a pipette and the remaining solution with a volume < ml containing the loose pellet was collected and diluted with ml _METHOD_ buffer in an eppendorf tube and centrifuged at at for min . after centrifugation the loose pellet at the base of the tube was collected with a ml pipette and resuspended gently in ml _METHOD_ buffer . the chloroplasts were then pelleted at the bottom of the tube by centrifugation at at for min . to obtain fractions containing mitochondria or the _LOCATION_ the homogenate was incubated on ice for min in
