_PROTEIN_ is a lipid second messenger involved in an array of processes occurring during a plant 's life cycle . these include development metabolism and both biotic and abiotic stress responses . _PROTEIN_ levels increase in response to salt but little is known about its function in the earliest responses to salt stress . in the present study we have combined an approach to isolate peripheral _LOCATION_ proteins of arabidopsis thaliana roots with lipid affinity purification to identify putative proteins that interact with _PROTEIN_ and are recruited to the _LOCATION_ in response to salt stress . of the putative _PROTEIN_ binding proteins identified by _METHOD_ a set of eight new candidate _PROTEIN_ binding proteins accumulated at the _LOCATION_ fraction after min of salt stress . among these were chc _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domain clathrin assembly proteins a putative regulator of potassium transport two ribosomal proteins gapdh and a _PROTEIN_ kinase . _PROTEIN_ binding and salt induced _LOCATION_ recruitment of gapdh and chc were confirmed by western blot analysis of the cellular fractions . in conclusion the approach of the present study is an effective way to isolate biologically relevant lipid binding proteins and provides new leads in the study of _PROTEIN_ mediated salt stress responses in roots .
to isolate the _PROTEIN_ targets that are involved in salt stress signalling proteins that are not only recruited to the _LOCATION_ upon salt treatment but also show binding affinity for _PROTEIN_ beads were isolated . salt induced increases in _PROTEIN_ formation are fast and transient typically occurring within min . by applying salt stress for only min we focused on those proteins that are relocalized to the _LOCATION_ rather than proteins that were induced at the level of _PROTEIN_ . isolated proteins were digested with trypsin while still bound to the _PROTEIN_ beads and subsequently peptides were identified and quantified using two different proteomic approaches itraq labelling of peptides and label free _METHOD_ analysis . hydroponically grown day old arabidopsis col plants were transferred to salt or to control media for min after which the root material was harvested homogenized and the proteins extracted . to isolate the _PROTEIN_ from the root tissue a differential centrifugation approach was applied . the flowscheme of the centrifugation steps used to isolate the _PROTEIN_ is shown in supplementary figure . the quality of the fractionation was determined by western blot analysis of the different fractions using antibodies raised against different cellular compartment markers pm _PROTEIN_ mitm _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and a _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ . first the total crude protein extracts of control and salt treated roots were centrifuged at g for min to remove the cell debris and intact organelles and the resulting pellets were enriched with the mitm and to a lesser extent with the _PROTEIN_ and pm marker . the g crude pellet fractions contained the pm and _PROTEIN_ and to a lesser extent the mitm marker whereas little of the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ was detectable . the g crude pellet fractions were subsequently washed with a buffer supplemented with brij which inverts liposome like structures to release trapped hydrophilic contaminants . in this brij wash the remaining _LOCATION_ proteins were released yielding a fraction containing only peripheral and transmembrane proteins . peripherally associated proteins were subsequently eluted from the _LOCATION_ using protein isolation buffer supplemented with mm resulting in _PROTEIN_ fractions that exclusively contained the _PROTEIN_ marker . _PROTEIN_ binding proteins or proteins that interact with the _LOCATION_ in a _PROTEIN_ dependent manner were purified from the _PROTEIN_ fraction of both the control and salt treated samples using _PROTEIN_ beads . the _PROTEIN_ beads have already been shown to be effective in isolation of _PROTEIN_ targets and validated in the present study to purify proteins in a _PROTEIN_ dependent manner . protein profiles of the total extract the g pellet the _PROTEIN_ fraction and the _PROTEIN_ fractions of the control and salt treated roots were visualized using silver staining . clear differences in the protein compositions between the different fractions were observed . the proportion of the total amount of proteins remaining in the sequential fractions was determined through protein quantification . the g crude pellet consisted of of the total protein extract and the _PROTEIN_ fraction consisted of of the g crude pellet . the _PROTEIN_ binding protein pool made up of the _PROTEIN_ fraction equivalent to of the total proteins . when comparing the control and salt treated samples of each fraction no clear differences in individual protein abundances were detectable in either the total the g pellet or the _PROTEIN_ fraction . only in the _PROTEIN_ binding protein fraction were differences in abundance observed between the control and the salt treated sample . to identify and quantify the _PROTEIN_ binding proteins they were tryptically digested directly on the _PROTEIN_ beads and identified by two different quantitative gel free _METHOD_ methods . in total three independent biological replicates were performed on the roots of plants per sample per experiment . for two experiments the resulting _PROTEIN_ binding peptides obtained by tryptic digestion were labelled with itraq whereas one replicate was analysed using label free _METHOD_ quantitation . the total number of peptides proteins and proteins enriched in the salt treated samples for either the itraq labelled or label free approach are summarized in figure . more peptides and proteins were identified in the label free approach but this did not result in the identification of more proteins that were differentially abundant in the salt stimulated sample . the combined data represent proteins identified in at least two of the independent replicate studies . the ratios between the average protein abundances in the salt and the control treated sample of the proteins identified are shown in figure . the proteins are arranged according to their s/c ratio starting with the largest enrichment in the salt stressed sample . most proteins were present in similar quantities in both the control and the salt treated samples . a total of eight of the identified proteins were enriched in the salt treated sample whereas no proteins were enriched in the control treated sample using a threshold . the s/c ratio of the eight proteins enriched in the salt stimulated samples is shown in figure and table . the eight proteins identified have been described as involved in various cellular processes . the identification of _PROTEIN_ implicates a role for _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ of potassium homoeostasis in saline conditions . in addition chc _METHOD_ and two clathrin assembly proteins were increased in the salt stressed sample . furthermore two _METHOD_ of gapdh and two ribosomal proteins were targeted to the _LOCATION_ in response to salt as was a _PROTEIN_ . the abundance of two prominent _LOCATION_ targeted candidate _PROTEIN_ binding proteins chc and gapdh was determined in the different fractions including the _PROTEIN_ binding fraction using specific antibodies . as shown above the pm marker was enriched in the g pellet fraction whereas the _PROTEIN_ marker was strongly enriched in the g pellet and present in the _PROTEIN_ pool . the _PROTEIN_ marker could not be detected in the _PROTEIN_ binding protein pool . the latter fraction did contain both chc and gapdh confirming their identification by _METHOD_ as _PROTEIN_ binding proteins . importantly salt stress increased chc and gapdh abundance in the _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ binding fractions of root extracts . this confirmed salt induced recruitment of both proteins to the _LOCATION_ and illustrated the reliability of the purification and identification procedure for _PROTEIN_ binding proteins .
arabidopsis plants were grown hydroponically for weeks under short day conditions with a weekly change of growth medium using the flora series . at h prior to stimulation the plants were transferred to fresh medium . for each _METHOD_ sample plants were used . hydroponically grown arabidopsis plants were treated by transfer to salt containing or control medium . the roots were subsequently excised and thereafter drained of excess water harvested and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen . a simplified version of the fractionation has originally been described previously . the root tissue was ground in liquid nitrogen and proteins were isolated by incubating the tissue in volume of protein extraction buffer for min on ice . samples were filtered through miracloth and centrifuged twice at g

. additionally the beads were washed twice with hepes after the described washing steps to remove the majority of the tween . for the specificity control experiments arabidopsis total protein extract was tested for binding to either the control or _PROTEIN_ coupled affigel beads that were treated identically except for the addition of _PROTEIN_ to the coupling reaction . synthesis of the _PROTEIN_ beads has been described previously . the _PROTEIN_ beads with the bound proteins from the control and stress related conditions were reduced with mm dtt for min at before _PROTEIN_ by mm iodoacetamide for min at room temperature in the dark both reactions were carried out in mm hepes . with a typical volume of the beads could easily be resuspended in the buffer and the reaction chemicals . an overnight digestion with of trypsin was performed at with continuous mixing . the supernatant containing tryptic peptides was collected after centrifugation at g for min in a table top centrifuge . the procedure was repeated once by washing the beads with of hepes buffer and both supernatants were mixed together . for label free quantification the samples were prepared for lc _METHOD_ by the hilic cleaning method . the collected supernatants of the samples were dried for h in a centrifugal vacuum concentrator at . the dried samples were reconstituted with dissolution buffer from the itraq kit according to the manufacturer 's instructions _METHOD_ . the control samples were labelled with itraq and the salt treated samples with itraq according to the manufacturer 's protocol . the samples were incubated at room temperature for h and subsequently the control and salt treated samples were mixed in a ratio and prepared for lc _METHOD_ by the hilic cleaning method . the samples were diluted with acn to a final concentration of acn . for the peptide enrichment _PROTEIN_ toptips were used in combination with the centrifuge _PROTEIN_ a microcentrifuge and a ml eppendorf vial . the samples were spun down for min at g. before using the toptips they were washed three times with tfa followed by three times with acn . the samples were loaded with consecutive portions on the hilic toptip followed by a three washes with acn . the peptides were collected in of tfa and stored at . nanoscale lc separation of the tryptic peptides was performed with a nanoacquity system . samples were loaded on to a symmetry trap column at a flow rate of prior to separation on a bridged ethyl hybrid analytical reversed phase column by application of a min gradient from acn and formic acid to acn and formic acid at a column flow rate of . analysis of the eluted tryptic peptides was performed using a synapt _PROTEIN_ q tof _METHOD_ spectrometer equipped with a nanolockspray source fitted with a pico tip emitter operated at a capillary voltage of approximately kv . the collision gas used was argon _PROTEIN_ at a constant pressure of mbar in the collision cell . the lock _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fibrinopeptide b was delivered from the auxiliary pump of the nanoacquity system with a concentration of at to the reference sprayer of the nanolockspray source . the data were post acquisition lock _METHOD_ corrected using the monoisotopic _METHOD_ of the doubly charged precursor of _PROTEIN_ fibrinopeptide b delivered through the reference sprayer which was sampled every s. for the label free experiments accurate _METHOD_ precursor and fragment ion lc _METHOD_ data were collected in the data independent lc _METHOD_ mode of acquisition . for the itraq labelled samples lc _METHOD_ data was collected in the tandem _METHOD_ data dependent mode of acquisition . in addition itraq labelled samples were separated on a reversed phase capillary column . sample introduction and mobile phase delivery at nl/min were performed using an ultimate nano lc system . for separation of peptides a gradient from acn and formic acid to acn and formic acid over min was used . the eluted peptides were electrosprayed into a q tof _METHOD_ spectrometer . the most abundant ions from the survey spectrum ranging from m/z to were automatically selected for collision induced fragmentation in a data dependent mode of acquisition using _METHOD_ . fragmentation was conducted with argon as the collision gas at a pressure of bars measured on the quadrupole pressure gauge . three biological replicates were performed in total . two biological replicates were analysed using itraq labelling . these samples were twice injected on the q tof and once on the synapt _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ spectrometer and the average values were used for quantification . the third biological replicate was analysed label free . each sample was injected three times on the synapt _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ spectrometer and the average values were used for quantification . the raw data files of the data dependent acquisitions of the itraq labelled samples were processed with mascot distiller using different parameters for the q tof and synapt _PROTEIN_ generated data because of differences in resolution and peak width between the two _METHOD_ spectrometers . the distiller output results were used to search the arabidopsis database to which common protein contaminants were appended using in house licensed mascot software . the mascot search parameters were as follows peptide and fragment _LOCATION_ tolerances da ions score cut off digest reagent was trypsin allow missed cleavage and the fixed modifications were cysteine _PROTEIN_ and itraq itraq . the individual peptide score for this database was . after evaluation of the output list the search was repeated with the same parameters but now with quantification itraq activated for a ratio include of . continuum lc _METHOD_ data were processed and searched using proteinlynx globalserver version . the parameter settings were the digest reagent was trypsin allow missed cleavage search tolerances automatic typically p.p.m . for precursor and p.p.m . for product ions the fixed modification was cysteine _PROTEIN_ and the variable modification was methionine oxidation . protein identifications were obtained by searching an a. thaliana database to which common protein contaminants were appended . the estimation of the false positive identification rates was performed by searching a randomized version of the abovementioned a. thaliana protein database generated within plgs . peptide identification data were exported as.csv files and imported into excel with the asap utilities add on installed . for the label free identification peptide identification data were filtered so only the peptides identified in at least two out of three replicate injections of a sample were deemed as reliable identifications . using this strict criterion no peptides from the _PROTEIN_ database were identified . subsequently the signal intensities reported by pgls per injection were normalized by the sum of the signal intensities of all of the identified peptides in that injection . following normalization the average of the replicate injections were calculated and the ratio was calculated for salt/control for each individual peptide identified . using a pivot table the average ratio s.d. number of peptides and number of proteotypic peptides per protein were extracted . proteins which did not have proteotypic peptides for which the peptides identified more than three different homologues were filtered out to create the final protein quantification table from the lc _METHOD_ data . the protein quantification data obtained from the itraq labelled samples were combined with the label free lc _METHOD_ data and only proteins quantified in at least two out of three samples are reported in figure table and supplementary table .
