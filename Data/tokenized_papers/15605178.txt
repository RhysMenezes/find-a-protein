a family of _LOCATION_ localised molecules was recently described in animals and fungi possessing extensive coiled regions and a short conserved c terminal domain called the _PROTEIN_ domain which is responsible for their location to this organelle . using the model plant arabidopsis thaliana we identified a gene _PROTEIN_ encoding a putative _PROTEIN_ protein . we demonstrated that the c terminal domain from _PROTEIN_ functions as a _LOCATION_ targeting sequence in plant cells . localisation studies in living cells _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ fused to a _METHOD_ probe showed extensive co location with the _LOCATION_ marker mannosidase i in transformed tobacco protoplasts . _PROTEIN_ like sequences were also found in genomic databases of rice maize wheat and alfalfa suggesting that this domain may be a useful _LOCATION_ marker for immunolocalisation studies . despite low sequence identity amongst _PROTEIN_ domains the plant _PROTEIN_ sequence was able to target to the _LOCATION_ of mammalian cells . taken together these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ domain proteins might be implicated in a targeting mechanism that is conserved amongst eukaryotes .
blastn searches of arabidopsis genomic and _PROTEIN_ sequence tag sequences in genbank with the c terminal _PROTEIN_ domain of the human protein identified a cdna sequence whose predicted amino acid sequence was identical and similar to that of over the amino acid positions predicted to comprise the _PROTEIN_ domain . whilst these values are not high the putative _PROTEIN_ domain also contained a universally conserved tyrosine residue characteristic of this _LOCATION_ targeting sequence . we called the putative arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ . however the of the cdna was missing from the truncated _PROTEIN_ sequence tag . overlapping the was a putative cdna sequence derived from genomic dna sequence by gene prediction software . due to the incorrect prediction of an exon/intron boundary did not contain a _PROTEIN_ domain but it appeared the putative cdna might contain the entire region of _PROTEIN_ since its corresponding amino acid sequence contained extensive coiled coil domains . this was confirmed by generating a complete bp cdna for _PROTEIN_ by reverse transcriptase pcr . the putative start codon of _PROTEIN_ was identified based on the absence of an open reading frame in the upstream dna sequence . _PROTEIN_ encodes a protein of amino acids with a predicted molecular _METHOD_ of kda and the _PROTEIN_ domain at the c terminus . the n terminal region of _PROTEIN_ was predicted by the program _PROTEIN_ to contain extensive coiled coil regions . these regions comprise about of _PROTEIN_ similar to the _PROTEIN_ proteins of animals and fungi . the function of these coiled coil regions is unknown but due to their ability to facilitate oligomerization it is expected they may form a molecular scaffold by interacting with _METHOD_ and with other proteins . several short regions within the _PROTEIN_ sequence including the n terminal most amino acids are not predicted to form coiled coils . similar short non coiled regions are also present in other _PROTEIN_ proteins but their functional significance is unknown . using the _PROTEIN_ domain of _PROTEIN_ to search genbank we found proteins with _PROTEIN_ like sequences in rice and maize . _PROTEIN_ like sequences were also identified from wheat and alfalfa indicating that proteins bearing this domain are conserved in plants . partial sequences for the n terminal regions of the plant _PROTEIN_ proteins could only be found for maize and as anticipated formed coiled coils . whereas plants fungi and some protists also appear to encode only one _PROTEIN_ protein animals contain several . without understanding the exact function of _PROTEIN_ proteins it is not possible to explain why animals possess more than one _PROTEIN_ gene . we speculate that cell secretion in different tissue types differential _LOCATION_ transport to _PROTEIN_ cell surfaces and regulated secretion may require multiple members of the _PROTEIN_ protein family within animal tissues . to confirm that the _PROTEIN_ like domain of _PROTEIN_ was necessary and sufficient for targeting to the _LOCATION_ apparatus of plant cells we fused the coding sequence of the last amino acids of _PROTEIN_ to the end of _METHOD_ and transformed this construct into suspension cultured cells of n. plumbaginifolia . small _METHOD_ labelled structures were observed throughout the cytoplasm and particularly concentrated in the perinuclear region of the cell . this labelling pattern is similar to previously published staining patterns of the _LOCATION_ apparatus in tobacco cells . therefore it is likely that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is located to the plant _LOCATION_ apparatus . furthermore we performed _METHOD_ on non transformed tobacco cells using an anti lewis antigen antibody previously validated as a plant _LOCATION_ marker . anti lewis antigen antibodies labelled punctate structures in tobacco cells that were strikingly similar to those labelled with the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein . to obtain further evidence for the _LOCATION_ location of _PROTEIN_ we used a tobacco bright yellow protoplast transformation system for the transient _PROTEIN_ of an _PROTEIN_ polypeptide fused to the of _PROTEIN_ . as a marker for the _LOCATION_ apparatus we used mani _METHOD_ . protoplasts transformed with dsred _PROTEIN_ displayed a punctate intracellular staining pattern which was very similar to the pattern observed in protoplasts transformed with mani _METHOD_ . in contrast and as expected tobacco cells transformed with the h _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct resulted in the labelling of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ which strongly indicates that the targeting of _PROTEIN_ to intracellular structures is specific . co transformation experiments were also performed with dsred _PROTEIN_ and mani _METHOD_ . extensive co location of dsred _PROTEIN_ with the _LOCATION_ marker mani _METHOD_ was observed . the punctate labelled structures were similar in appearance to those observed in protoplasts transformed with the individual constructs . this result _METHOD_ the location of _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ apparatus . interestingly although dsred _PROTEIN_ and mani _METHOD_ appear to be located on the same structures they do not show complete co location and regions of non overlapping _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were detected on the periphery of the labelled structures . this observation indicates that the _PROTEIN_ protein may be located to a more distal _LOCATION_ compartment than the cis _LOCATION_ located man i marker . indeed mammalian _PROTEIN_ domains have been shown to specifically target the _LOCATION_ of the tgn . it has previously been shown that _PROTEIN_ domains are functionally conserved from yeast to mammals . therefore we examined whether the putative arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ domain could function as a _LOCATION_ targeting sequence in mammalian cells . a chimeric cdna encoding amino acids to of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ protein fused to the end of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was transiently _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ cells . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was weakly targeted to the _LOCATION_ of transfected _PROTEIN_ cells . as the sequences flanking _PROTEIN_ domains have been shown to increase the efficiency with which _METHOD_ fusions are targeted to the _LOCATION_ apparatus we generated another construct containing the c terminal amino acids fused to _METHOD_ . this kda _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein was located to the perinuclear region of transfected _PROTEIN_ cells consistent with a _LOCATION_ location . the intracellular location of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was very similar to the location of _METHOD_ which has been shown to target to tgn _LOCATION_ . the reason that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is a better _LOCATION_ targeting molecule in animal cells than _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is probably due to the presence of the coiled coil regions . transfection of _PROTEIN_ cells with wild type _METHOD_ resulted as expected in a dispersed _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ .
