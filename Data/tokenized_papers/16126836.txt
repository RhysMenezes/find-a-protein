cell to cell communication in plants involves the trafficking of macromolecules through specialized intercellular organelles termed plasmodesmata . this exchange of proteins and rna is likely regulated and a role for protein phosphorylation has been implicated but specific components remain to be identified . here we describe the molecular characterization of a plasmodesmal associated protein kinase _PROTEIN_ . a kd protein isolated from a plasmodesmal preparation exhibits calcium independent kinase activity and displays substrate specificity in that it recognizes a subset of viral and endogenous non cell autonomous proteins . this _PROTEIN_ specifically phosphorylates the c terminal residues of tobacco mosaic virus movement protein _PROTEIN_ this posttranslational modification has been shown to affect _PROTEIN_ function . molecular analysis of purified protein established that tobacco _PROTEIN_ is a member of the casein kinase i family . subcellular localization studies identified a possible arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ homolog _PROTEIN_ . tmv _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are colocalized within cross walls in a pattern consistent with targeting to plasmodesmata . moreover arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ also phosphorylates tmv _PROTEIN_ in vitro at its c terminus . these results strongly suggest that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ is a close homolog of tobacco _PROTEIN_ . thus _PROTEIN_ represents a novel plant protein kinase that is targeted to plasmodesmata and may play a regulatory role in macromolecular trafficking between plant cells .
a biochemical approach was developed to identify the plasmodesmal associated subcellular fraction that was enriched in kinase activity . for this purpose we used a protocol recently developed for the isolation of a plasmodesmal enriched cell wall protein fraction from tobacco suspension cultured cells . the tmv _PROTEIN_ was used as substrate in phosphorylation assays performed on pecp subfractions . this viral ncap was selected as it was previously shown to be phosphorylated by a kinase present in cell wall extracts and this modification was correlated with its altered movement function . our experiments indicated that the highest kinase activity was present in the mm extracted proteins . it is important to note that was similarly highly enriched in this same pecp subfraction . importantly the tmv _PROTEIN_ was not phosphorylated by either the supernatant or the subcellular fraction containing detergent extracted proteins from the cell wall pellet . to identify the molecular nature of this putative _PROTEIN_ the enzyme was further purified by employing a combination of chromatographic protocols including cation exchange lectin and heparin columns . the pecp extracts from several preparations were pooled and proteins first fractionated by cation exchange chromatography and their profile then resolved by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . fractions containing high levels of enzyme activity were again identified based on our tmv _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation assay . these peak fractions were again pooled and a relatively high level of _PROTEIN_ purification was achieved following lectin and heparin chromatography . _METHOD_ blue stained _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gels revealed the presence of several discrete bands within this purified and enriched pecp fraction . to determine the protein band corresponding to the putative _PROTEIN_ in gel phosphorylation assays were next performed . these experiments established that the apparent molecular _METHOD_ of the purified _PROTEIN_ was kd . _PROTEIN_ activity was also detected in pecp fractions prepared from tobacco leaf tissues and in gel phosphorylation assays similarly revealed kinase activity associated with an kd protein . biochemical assays were next performed to establish the functional characteristics of this kd putative _PROTEIN_ . experiments were first conducted to ascertain whether _PROTEIN_ exhibited calcium dependent protein kinase activity . pumpkin _PROTEIN_ is a calcium dependent protein kinase identified from pumpkin phloem sap and it was used as a control for calcium dependent phosphorylation of the tmv _PROTEIN_ in vitro . in contrast with pumpkin _PROTEIN_ the phosphorylation of tmv _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ was calcium independent . in general _PROTEIN_ is preferred as a phosphate donor by most protein kinases . consistent with this notion pumpkin _PROTEIN_ did not appear to use _PROTEIN_ as a phosphate donor . interestingly both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ could be used as good phosphate donors for the tobacco _PROTEIN_ . recently it was shown that a plant cell wall extract contained kinase activity that could phosphorylate tmv _PROTEIN_ in a calcium independent manner . the phosphorylation sites were mapped to the three residues and within the c terminal end of the tmv _PROTEIN_ . as _PROTEIN_ is enriched in our pecp fraction and phosphorylates tmv _PROTEIN_ we next investigated whether this enzyme might be the corresponding endogenous kinase . for these studies a deletion mutant that lacked the c terminal amino acid residues _PROTEIN_ and a recombinant glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ fusion protein containing the c terminal residues of tmv _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were constructed . in contrast with the full length tmv _PROTEIN_ the engineered tmv _PROTEIN_ served as a poor substrate for phosphorylation by the purified _PROTEIN_ . densitometric analysis indicated that the level of phosphorylation of tmv _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ was of that observed for the tmv _PROTEIN_ . this result indicated that the major phosphorylation site for _PROTEIN_ is located within the deleted region of the tmv _PROTEIN_ . as the _PROTEIN_ of this mutant was as stable as that of full length tmv _PROTEIN_ protein instability is unlikely to be responsible for this reduction in phosphorylation by the _PROTEIN_ . consistent with this notion the tmv _PROTEIN_ served as a comparable substrate to the full length tmv _PROTEIN_ for phosphorylation by pumpkin _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ also served as a substrate for phosphorylation by _PROTEIN_ controls using _PROTEIN_ alone demonstrated the specificity of this reaction . however in comparison with the full length tmv _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ appeared to serve as a less favorable substrate . the level of phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ was of that observed for the tmv _PROTEIN_ based on densitometric analysis . specificity of the phosphorylation reaction mediated by _PROTEIN_ toward the c terminus of tmv _PROTEIN_ was supported by the finding that pumpkin _PROTEIN_ failed to phosphorylate the _PROTEIN_ . taken together our results indicate that the major _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation site resides within the c terminal amino acid residues of tmv _PROTEIN_ . these findings support the hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ is a plant protein kinase that recognizes ncaps such as the tmv _PROTEIN_ . it is possible that _PROTEIN_ might be an endogenous kinase that modulates specifically tmv _PROTEIN_ upon viral infection . if this were the case _PROTEIN_ would likely be _PROTEIN_ in tmv host plants and its _PROTEIN_ might well be affected by viral infection . moreover the substrate specificity of _PROTEIN_ could be quite narrow if not exclusive to tmv _PROTEIN_ . alternatively _PROTEIN_ could play a role in controlling ncap trafficking during normal plant growth and development . under this scenario _PROTEIN_ would likely show broad substrate specificity toward both viral and endogenous ncaps . to test between these two possibilities we next examined the substrate specificity of _PROTEIN_ . for this purpose we selected four additional viral _PROTEIN_ and two well characterized endogenous ncaps . and represent _PROTEIN_ encoded by a dna virus bean dwarf mosaic virus while the _PROTEIN_ of cucumber mosaic virus and red clover mosaic virus were selected as examples of rna viruses . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are plant transcription _PROTEIN_ that are well characterized for their non cell autonomous activities . under the in vitro conditions used for our experiments _PROTEIN_ displayed substrate specificity in that it phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ and tmv _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ or . the _PROTEIN_ of cmv and rcnmv were also examined and found to serve as poor substrates for _PROTEIN_ . these studies established that _PROTEIN_ likely functions in the recognition and phosphorylation of a specific subset of ncaps of both plant and viral origin . to identify the tobacco gene encoding _PROTEIN_ the kd protein band was excised and subjected to conventional internal peptide microsequencing . a national center for biotechnology information blast database search was conducted using the resultant peptide sequences and this identified _PROTEIN_ as a member of the _PROTEIN_ gene family . _PROTEIN_ is a ser/thr protein kinase family found in eukaryotes . the kinase domains of plant _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ that were identified in the arabidopsis and rice genome databases shared similarity at the amino acid sequence level . interestingly all _PROTEIN_ derived peptide microsequences were found to match this highly conserved kinase domain . this result prevented us from determining the actual tobacco _PROTEIN_ isoform corresponding to the biochemically purified _PROTEIN_ . as both n and c terminal regions of purified _PROTEIN_ were found to be blocked we designed degenerate primers based on the identified peptide sequences to amplify pcr products that were then used to probe a tobacco cdna library . a number of cdna clones that contained regions closely matching the peptide microsequences were isolated . this indicated that the catalytic domain of _PROTEIN_ is highly conserved . however we were unable to obtain any cdna clones that completely matched all seven peptide microsequences and also encoded a kd protein the apparent molecular _METHOD_ of purified _PROTEIN_ . to resolve this situation we adopted an alternative approach to identify the _PROTEIN_ gene based on the expectation that _PROTEIN_ would be localized to or near plasmodesmata . the arabidopsis genome was found to contain some casein kinase i like _PROTEIN_ genes and within the conserved kinase domains they shared sequence similarity at the amino acid level . of these genes one appeared to be a pseudogene based on the _PROTEIN_ that it contained an in frame stop codon and/or short deletions within the conserved kinase subdomains no reliable ests have been reported and rt pcr amplification of the putative transcript failed to yield any product . by contrast all other members were successfully amplified by rt pcr . as two _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are apparently derived from alternative splicing we concluded that genes give rise to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . molecular information and intracellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in yeast and humans _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ contain variable domains either at the n or c terminus in arabidopsis all _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ appeared to contain c terminal extensions with variable lengths from to amino acid residues . three out of four yeast _METHOD_ and contain isoprenylation sites at their c termini and are associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . however no significant sequence conservation predictable motifs or domains for specific intracellular targeting/localization were detected within any of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ extensions . in view of this finding the intracellular localization/targeting of each _PROTEIN_ isoform was determined by _PROTEIN_ n or c terminal green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion proteins in plant cells . for transient _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins appropriate plasmid constructs were biolistically bombarded into tobacco suspension cultured cells . we divided these _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ into three groups on the basis of localization patterns determined by _METHOD_ microscopy . group _METHOD_ exhibited a predominantly punctate _METHOD_ pattern at the cell periphery group _METHOD_ had strong _METHOD_ signals within the _LOCATION_ but signal was also present in the cytoplasm and for group _METHOD_ signal was located predominantly in the cytoplasm with only a low level detected in the _LOCATION_ . parallel _PROTEIN_ studies were also performed using tobacco leaf tissues . here similar results were obtained with these same _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs when we analyzed epidermal cells of mature tobacco leaves . fusion of _METHOD_ either at the _PROTEIN_ n or c terminus did not appear to make a difference in _METHOD_ of the observed localization patterns . these results indicate that the specific localization of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is not dependent on either terminus being exposed . among the _PROTEIN_ genes group _METHOD_ were considered most likely to contain the _PROTEIN_ homolog as they formed punctate _METHOD_ signals along the periphery of both suspension cultured and epidermal cells . indeed in epidermal cells the _METHOD_ pattern associated with group _METHOD_ including _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was very similar to those earlier observed for viral _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ associated _METHOD_ pattern appeared rather distinct in that although the signal appeared punctate in nature the protein was also detected in both the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ . among the group _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ gave rise to the most stable _PROTEIN_ and therefore was selected for further characterization as a putative arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ . we first tested whether the localization pattern of _PROTEIN_ was consistent between arabidopsis and tobacco . the experiments demonstrated that transient _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis and tobacco leaves yielded similar punctate patterns . to address more directly the association of _PROTEIN_ with plasmodesmata we next conducted colocalization studies using _PROTEIN_ and tmv _PROTEIN_ . to this end _PROTEIN_ was transiently _PROTEIN_ as a translational fusion to red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ in transgenic tobacco plants _PROTEIN_ tmv _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ driven by the constitutive promoter . to ascertain whether _PROTEIN_ and tmv _PROTEIN_ use the same intracellular delivery pathway we first examined the _METHOD_ patterns present within specialized epidermal cells the guard cells . these cells were chosen because at maturity they are symplasmically isolated as they do not have functional plasmodesmata . as such these guard cells provide a single cell based assay within the context of an intact leaf . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in individual guard cells gave rise to strong punctate red _METHOD_ signals . a similar green punctate pattern was detected for tmv _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ within the same cell . however the strong accumulation of tmv _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal within the target guard cell is apparently induced by the ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ as equivalent tmv _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal is not detected within the member of the guard cell pair nor in other guard cells . note the punctate green _METHOD_ signals within the epidermal cell walls previously shown to reflect the localization of tmv _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ within plasmodesmal pit fields . importantly _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and tmv _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals were found to be colocalized consistent with the hypothesis that both proteins engage a similar intracellular delivery pathway . epidermal pavement cells exhibited a similar pattern of overlapping signals between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and tmv _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in these experiments the tmv _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was detected within the cross walls as a green punctate signal . again it is important to note that within individually bombarded target cells punctate signals produced by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ almost always overlapped with those of tmv _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . these results provide strong support for the hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ is targeted to plasmodesmata or it is associated with novel plasmodesmal targeting machinery . moreover these studies imply that the in vivo interaction between _PROTEIN_ and tmv _PROTEIN_ likely occurs either during targeting to and/or within plasmodesmata . colocalization data strongly suggested that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ represents a homolog of the _PROTEIN_ purified from tobacco . however stronger evidence would be provided if these two _METHOD_ shared similar enzymatic properties . to this end full length arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ as a _PROTEIN_ fusion protein in escherichia coli affinity purified and tested for phosphorylation activity . as shown in figure recombinant arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ phosphorylated tmv _PROTEIN_ and its derivatives bdmv and _PROTEIN_ in a similar manner to that observed with the tobacco _PROTEIN_ . interestingly recombinant arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ appeared to have relatively stronger substrate preference toward than _PROTEIN_ . densitometric analysis indicated that the levels of phosphorylation of tmv _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ by arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ were and of that observed for the tmv _PROTEIN_ respectively which is comparable to the tobacco _PROTEIN_ result . in replicate experiments _PROTEIN_ and bdmv were not phosphorylated by recombinant arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ but all other proteins showed consistent patterns of phosphorylation . taken together the results for substrate specificity as demonstrated by these experiments provided strong support for the hypothesis that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ is a close homolog of tobacco _PROTEIN_ .
_PROTEIN_ of by tobacco suspension culture cells and preparation of pecp proteins were performed essentially as previously described . briefly cells were harvested d after transfer by filtering liters of culture through miracloth . cells were then given a nondisrupting wash in mm calcium solution to remove noncovalently bound proteins . pecp preparations were also obtained using young leaves of

used . for kinase assays involving recombinant arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ of purified _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was added to the kinase assay mixture . in some assays _PROTEIN_ was used as the phosphate donor . kinase assay components were assembled in each tube on ice and following transfer to the _PROTEIN_ mixture was added and incubated for min . reactions were stopped by adding of _PROTEIN_ sample loading buffer . aliquots of each reaction mixture were resolved in to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gel and autoradiographed to identify kinase activity . densitometry analysis of autoradiograph was performed using _PROTEIN_ imagej software . in gel autophosphorylation assays were performed as previously described . briefly following electrophoresis the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gels were washed in buffer d . gels were then incubated for h in buffer d containing mm mercaptoethanol before protein denaturation in the same buffer containing m guanidine hcl . proteins were renatured by incubation in buffer d containing and m guanidine hcl . gels were then incubated in buffer d containing tween followed by equilibration in phosphorylation assay buffer containing mm hepes ph mm and mm egta . in gel phosphorylation was performed by incubating the conditioned gel in a complete assay buffer including mm dtt and _PROTEIN_ mixture _PROTEIN_ for h. phosphorylation reactions were stopped by rinsing the gels with water and then incubating in trichloroacetic acid and sodium pyrophosphate . in gel substrate phosphorylation in which tmv _PROTEIN_ was polymerized to a final concentration of gel was performed as for in gel autophosphorylation assays . _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in and purified from escherichia coli . containing _PROTEIN_ cdna in frame to _PROTEIN_ was digested with hindiii and ecori blunt ended and self ligated to produce a c terminal deletion mutant whose _PROTEIN_ in e. coli yields functional _PROTEIN_ . soluble _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was purified using glutathione agarose following a standard protocol . other proteins used in phosphorylation assays were prepared by renaturing inclusion bodies . briefly protein _PROTEIN_ in actively growing cells was induced by treatment with mm isopropyl d thiogalactopyranoside for h at . cells were then lysed in b per bacterial lysis buffer by sonication and inclusion bodies were pelleted by centrifugation . pellets were then washed several times and resuspended in denaturation buffer _PROTEIN_ boiled for min and cooled on ice for min . renaturation of proteins was performed by a stepwise dialysis in which the ratio between renaturation and denaturation buffers was gradually increased from to . _PROTEIN_ was recalcitrant to _PROTEIN_ in e. coli possibly due to its toxic effect to the bacteria . however the following protocol allowed the production of active full length enzyme . briefly the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ open reading frame was fused to _PROTEIN_ in frame using pgex kg plasmid by pcr cloning . following dna sequence confirmation pgst _PROTEIN_ was transformed into an e. coli host rosetta plys . transformed cells were streaked onto luria bertani plates containing chloramphenicol and _PROTEIN_ and grown overnight at . cells were then transferred to ml luria bertani media containing antibiotics and grown at by shaking at rpm until an od of was attained . protein _PROTEIN_ was induced by adding mm isopropyl d thiogalactopyranoside to the culture and incubating for h at with gentle shaking . cells were harvested and lysed with b per e. coli extraction buffer according to the manufacturer 's protocol . cell extracts were briefly sonicated and centrifuged for min at . the supernatant was then added to ml of glutathione agarose beads pre equilibrated with mm tris and mm nacl and incubated for min at while rotating the beads end over end . following four times of wash in equilibration buffer _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was eluted from beads with mm glutathione buffer ph quantified and used in phosphorylation assays . plasmid vectors pdgn pdgc and _PROTEIN_ were constructed for the _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ fusion proteins in plants . the multicloning site of pdgn was constructed by transferring the enhanced _METHOD_ _METHOD_ from _METHOD_ pl to the _PROTEIN_ cassette of a plant _PROTEIN_ vector . first was modified to remove the saci site by blunt ending the site and self ligation . the vector was then digested with bamhi followed by blunt ending and xhoi digestion to remove an intron sequence between the promoter and ocs terminator . the mcs _METHOD_ fragment released from the _METHOD_ pl by restriction enzyme digestions with noti followed by blunt ending and xhoi was inserted into the _PROTEIN_ cassette by ligation . pdgc was constructed in a similar manner such that it contained the same mcs as that of pdgn but allowed for the formation of _METHOD_ fusion protein in the reverse orientation _METHOD_ . in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was replaced with to allow the _PROTEIN_ of n terminal _METHOD_ fusion proteins . _PROTEIN_ open reading frames or cdnas were cloned by rt pcr . for this purpose total rna and mrna were prepared from arabidopsis root tissue using trizol and the rneasy mrna purification kit following the protocols provided by the suppliers . following the rt reactions employing powerscript reverse transcriptase pcr amplification was performed with gene specific primers and a high fidelity taq polymerase . pcr products were then cloned into pdgn pdgc or _PROTEIN_ via topo cloning kits . the sequence of all _PROTEIN_ inserts in these topo clones was confirmed before subcloning into the respective _PROTEIN_ vectors . for localization of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusion constructs transient assays were performed by employing both
