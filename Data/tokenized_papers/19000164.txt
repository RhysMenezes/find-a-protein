plant growth and development is dependent on the specification and _PROTEIN_ of pools of stem cells found in the _METHOD_ . mutations in the arabidopsis meristem _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gene lead to a loss of stem cell and meristematic activity in the root and vegetative shoot . _PROTEIN_ encodes a putative rs domain protein with a predicted role in transcription or rna processing control . mdf mutants exhibit _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrnas which is associated with a reduction in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ levels and with a defective auxin maximum in the basal region of the developing mdf embryo and seedling root meristem . seedling roots also exhibit reduced _PROTEIN_ scarecrow and shortroot gene _PROTEIN_ a loss of stem cell activity terminal differentiation of the root meristem and defective cell patterning . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is not defective in the bodenlos _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ auxin mutants and is not modulated by exogenous auxin . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants have unaffected levels of _PROTEIN_ rna indicating that _PROTEIN_ acts upstream of _PROTEIN_ and plt gene _PROTEIN_ . differentiation of the shoot stem cell pool also occurs in mdf mutants associated with a reduced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domain and expanded _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domain . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ leads to the activation of markers of embryonic identity and ectopic meristem activity in vegetative tissues . these results demonstrate a requirement for the _PROTEIN_ dependent pathway in regulating _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mediated meristem activity .
we have previously used laser capture microdissection and transcriptomics to analyse patterns of temporal and spatial gene _PROTEIN_ during embryogenesis in arabidopsis with the aim of identifying genes required for meristem organization and identity . the _PROTEIN_ gene was found to be preferentially _PROTEIN_ in the basal region of globular and heart stage embryos . _PROTEIN_ encodes a predicted polypeptide of amino acids and in arabidopsis only encodes a predicted protein sharing homology with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . putative orthologues of _PROTEIN_ exist in rice brassica medicago vine and physcomitrella . blast searches revealed homology with the animal sart family of proteins with identity between _PROTEIN_ and human sart in the amino acid c terminal domains but with only limited homology elsewhere . hsart has been shown to be an _PROTEIN_ related protein of the tri small _LOCATION_ ribonucleoprotein complex of the spliceosome and is required for correct spliceosome assembly . as with hsart the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ contains a putative rs domain characterized by a number of arginine residues alternating with serine glutamate or aspartate dipeptides indicating that _PROTEIN_ is a putative _PROTEIN_ related protein . the _PROTEIN_ polypeptide is predicted to contain a c terminal _LOCATION_ localization motif and an n terminal rna binding domain but no other conserved domains were identified . to determine the spatial _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ in roots we examined promdf gus _PROTEIN_ in seedlings . gus activity was observed in the _PROTEIN_ root cap columella and meristem and was strongly active in the _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was also found in young _PROTEIN_ root primordia with weaker _PROTEIN_ through the rest of the meristem and vasculature . to determine the subellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein promdf _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein fusion _PROTEIN_ was determined in transgenic plants . analysis of these plants by confocal laser scanning microsopy confirmed that the _PROTEIN_ polypeptide is preferentially localized to the _LOCATION_ in cells of the root meristem a control _METHOD_ is localized to the cytoplasm . a _LOCATION_ localization for _PROTEIN_ is also predicted by the plant ploc protein localization software . to characterize the developmental role of the _PROTEIN_ gene two t dna insertion alleles were identified . the mdf allele contains an insertion within the ninth predicted intron whereas the mdf allele has an insertion within the ninth exon exon to the _PROTEIN_ start codon is non coding . a wild type _PROTEIN_ transcript could not be detected in plants homozygous for either mdf or mdf indicating that these are putative null alleles . homozygous mdf and mdf seedlings displayed similar phenotypes being severely dwarfed with typically three cotyledons and a reduced root system . the mutation was seedling lethal with lethality by ca . days post germination . this phenotype segregated with the t dna insertions in the _PROTEIN_ gene and was complemented by the introduction of an _PROTEIN_ cdna _PROTEIN_ confirming this function . to further characterize the function of the _PROTEIN_ gene we first investigated its role in root development . the primary root of the mdf mutant is significantly shorter than that of wild type seedlings . we examined roots at and d.p.g . to determine if this resulted from a reduction in either meristematic activity or cell length . at both time points both the size of the proximal meristem and the length of mature cortical cells were significantly shorter in mdf mutants indicating that both reduced meristematic activity and cell expansion contribute to the shorter roots of mdf mutants . the reduction in size of the proximal meristem is also demonstrated by an analysis of the _PROTEIN_ of the cdb gus marker . the number of dividing cells as detected by the cdb gus marker was highly variable in mdf mutants compared with the wild type . moreover the dividing cells occupied a smaller area in mdf indicating a reduction in the population of dividing cells in the mdf root meristem . it was also found that between the two time points the proximal meristem in mdf mutants was reduced in size . no reduction in size of the proximal meristem was observed in wild type roots or in the size of mature cortical cells in both the wild type and mdf mutant between and d.p.g . . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ is also required for correct root meristem patterning we examined the _PROTEIN_ of different tissue specific markers in the mdf mutant . enhancer trap _PROTEIN_ marks the endodermis and was typically observed in isolated cells and in non contiguous files of cells in mdf roots . similar observations were made for enhancer traps _PROTEIN_ and which mark the ground tissue and vascular initials _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ root cap and _PROTEIN_ where again mdf roots showed _PROTEIN_ in isolated cells or a reduced _PROTEIN_ domain . these results indicate an inability either to specify or _PROTEIN_ the root radial pattern and cell identity in mdf . to determine whether these defects were the result of an inability to correctly specify _PROTEIN_ cells which act as a central organizer in the root meristem we examined the _PROTEIN_ of the marker _PROTEIN_ in mdf . at d.p.g . _PROTEIN_ activity was observed in both wild type and mdf root _METHOD_ . however in mdf often only a single cell showed _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ marker . by d.p.g . cells marked by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were more distally positioned in the mdf mutant compared with the wild type which appeared to result from a loss of root cap cells . to determine if this was the case we examined the columella cells over a developmental time course in the mdf mutant . as early as d.p.g. the columella of mdf lacks organization and is not arranged in the distinctive tiers displayed by the wild type . at d.p.g . fewer cells have columella cell identity as determined by the presence of starch granules and no columella cells are evident by d.p.g. indicating a failure to specify columella cells associated with a terminal differentiation of the root meristem . the establishment of an auxin gradient and maximum in the root is critical for correct meristem organization and this is determined by correct _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ and localization . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in particular have significant roles in directional auxin flow through the root cap and epidermis and in _PROTEIN_ the auxin reflux loop . to determine if the defects in cell specification and _PROTEIN_ size in mdf mutants are associated with defective _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ transcription analysis and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization was carried out . quantitative real time rt pcr showed that transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were significantly reduced in mdf mutants although other members of the _PROTEIN_ family showed only minor changes in _PROTEIN_ levels . transcriptional changes for these _PROTEIN_ genes were also reflected in defective protein fusion levels . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was found as expected in the basal cells of the wild type heart stage embryo but it was absent in heart stage mdf embryos . wild type seedlings containing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs showed the expected localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the cortical and epidermal layers of the root and of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the meristem and columella . in mdf mutants however although the cellular _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ appeared essentially correct _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ levels were much reduced in the epidermal layer and the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ domain was much reduced in the columella . to determine whether auxin distribution was also disrupted in the mutant we examined _PROTEIN_ of the auxin responsive _METHOD_ reporter . in the mdf heart stage embryo the typical _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ in the incipient root meristem is absent . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in mdf seedling root tips was significantly reduced and was restricted to the _PROTEIN_ and central columella with none detected in the _PROTEIN_ root cap as observed in the wild type . together these data show that _PROTEIN_ function is required for the correct _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ and auxin distribution in the embryo and in the seedling . given the role of phytohormones in root meristem organization and _PROTEIN_ and the defects observed in mdf mutants we examined whether hormones regulate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . exogenous treatment of seedlings with auxin cytokinin and gibberellic acid did not significantly affect transcript levels or the spatial _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is not transcriptionally regulated by these hormones . furthermore _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is not affected in the auxin transport mutants _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ nor is the mdf root phenotype rescued by growth in the presence of auxins . the auxin insensitive bodenlos mutant fails to establish a _PROTEIN_ during embryogenesis . although the root of bdl mutants is highly disorganized _PROTEIN_ is still _PROTEIN_ . together these data show that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is regulated independently of these auxin transport and signalling pathways . the establishment of an auxin peak around the _PROTEIN_ and root cap as well as correct auxin signalling is required for the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . interestingly roots of mdf mutants resemble those of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants . it is therefore possible that _PROTEIN_ acts upstream of the auxin distribution pathway and of the plt genes . to investigate this we examined the _PROTEIN_ of the plt genes and of other transcriptional regulators required for meristem specification and positioning in mdf mutants . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the related _PROTEIN_ like transcription _PROTEIN_ baby boom _PROTEIN_ all showed significant reductions in transcript levels in the mdf mutant . similarly the transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which are independent of the plt genes and auxin are reduced in mdf consistent with the defective radial patterning and _PROTEIN_ specification . we also determined whether the failure to _PROTEIN_ the root meristem in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants is caused by a reduction in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . however _PROTEIN_ transcript levels are not detectably affected in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings . furthermore _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was not dependent on _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ activity indicating that _PROTEIN_ acts independently of these meristem regulators . given the root meristem defects in mdf mutants we asked whether _PROTEIN_ is also required to _PROTEIN_ the stem cell population of the shoot . consistent with such a role promdf gus _PROTEIN_ was found in the shoot apex and the mdf seedling shoot typically exhibits three cotyledons . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ occurs below the stem cell population in the shoot apical meristem and positively controls the size of the stem cell population in a non cell autonomous manner . in mdf mutants the domain of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ determined using prowus nlsgus was consistently reduced compared with that found in wild type seedlings which is consistent with a role for _PROTEIN_ in the sam and with the gradual loss of meristem activity observed in mdf mutants . _PROTEIN_ acts in a feedback loop with the _PROTEIN_ genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . they negatively regulate the shoot stem cell population and a loss of _PROTEIN_ activity leads to an expansion of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domain which marks the stem cell niche in the shoot . consistent with reduced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was upregulated in mdf . _PROTEIN_ mdf double mutants show a shoot phenotype intermediate between the two parental mutants suggesting that _PROTEIN_ does not function directly in the same genetic pathway as _PROTEIN_ to regulate meristem activity . as mdf mutants are unable to _PROTEIN_ meristem activity we investigated whether _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is sufficient to promote stem cell identity or meristem activity . the approach was to overexpress ectopically the _PROTEIN_ cdna under the control of the rna gene promoter . seven independent _PROTEIN_ lines were generated and and lines of each were found to contain morphologically abnormal seedlings . predominantly these included seedlings that resemble those previously described following ectopic _PROTEIN_ of the embryogenic identity gene _PROTEIN_ resulting in a turnip like mutant phenotype exhibiting ectopic accumulation of storage products . similarly we found ectopic accumulation of oils at the root hypocotyl junction one characteristic of embryonic tissues . other lines displayed ectopic shoot formation resembled mutants defective in the cup _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ genes or completely lacked a root meristem . the phenotypes of these _PROTEIN_ seedlings did not correlate with changes in the mrna levels of the root meristem regulators _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or the embryo specific _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ nor was the _PROTEIN_ of these genes influenced following inducible overexpression of _PROTEIN_ . furthermore the penetrance of the phenotypes of the _PROTEIN_ lines was not influenced by growth in the presence of phytohormones as has been demonstrated for pickle and tnp mutants . taken together this suggests that _PROTEIN_ is able to confer embryonic or meristematic identity on vegetative tissue .
