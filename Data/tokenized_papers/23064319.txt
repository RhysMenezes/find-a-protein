the proper balance of parental genomic contributions to the fertilized embryo and endosperm is essential for their normal growth and development . the characterization of many gametophytic maternal effect _PROTEIN_ mutants affecting seed development indicates that there are certain classes of genes with a predominant maternal contribution . we present a detailed analysis of the _PROTEIN_ mutant zak ixik which displays delayed and arrested growth at the earliest stages of embryo and endosperm development . zix encodes an armadillo repeat protein highly conserved across eukaryotes . _PROTEIN_ studies revealed that zix manifests a _PROTEIN_ through preferential maternal _PROTEIN_ in the early embryo and endosperm . this parent of origin dependent _PROTEIN_ is regulated by neither the histone and dna methylation nor the dna demethylation pathways known to regulate some other _PROTEIN_ mutants . the zix protein is localized in the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ of cells in reproductive tissues and actively dividing root zones . the maternal zix allele is required for the maternal _PROTEIN_ of . collectively our results reveal a reproductive function of plant arm proteins in promoting early seed growth which is achieved through a distinct _PROTEIN_ of zix that involves _METHOD_ for maternal allele specific _PROTEIN_ that are independent of the well established pathways .
the original zix allele was isolated through the distorted segregation ratio of a ds carrying mutant allele in the landsberg _LOCATION_ background in which the ds element had inserted in the first exon of _GENE_ . from the same mutant screen we subsequently identified two additional alleles with ds insertions at two other locations in the first exon of the same gene . seed abortion frequencies in mature siliques of heterozygous zix/zix plants reached between and compared with in wild type plants . transmission of all mutant alleles which carried the kanamycin resistance gene assessed by the ratio of kan resistant to kan sensitive seedlings deviated from the expected mendelian ratios of and for self fertilized and outcrossed heterozygotes respectively . this segregation ratio distortion with the transmission of the female alleles being more severely reduced than that of the male alleles indicates that these are gametophytic mutants . moreover we could not obtain kan resistant progeny populations from any mutant heterozygote despite reasonable transmission of both male and female mutant alleles which implies that additional zygotic embryo lethality underlies the genetics of these mutant alleles . a detailed phenotypic characterization of the female gametophytes in ovules of unpollinated zix/zix pistils revealed a slight delay in embryo sac maturation d after emasculation stage flowers of zix/zix plants had more ovules with unfused _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ than those of wild type plants . the most prominent mutant phenotype however was observed during early seed development after fertilization when we followed the developmental progression of seeds derived from zix mutant embryo sacs . at d after pollination zix zygotes and early endosperm grew more slowly than those in wild type embryo sacs in of wild type seeds the zygote had elongated and the endosperm had undergone three to four rounds of _LOCATION_ division on the other hand only to of zix seeds had reached a comparable stage of zygote and endosperm development . in of wild type seeds the zygotes were short and symmetric and the endosperm had undergone only one or two division cycles while up to of zix seeds still remained at this stage . this slow growth phenotype resulted _PROTEIN_ of whether the pollen were derived from wild type or heterozygous zix/zix flowers with the zix allele displaying the most severe delay probably due to the ds insertion being closest to the start codon . at dap in wild type self fertilized siliques of the seeds were past the four cell embryo stage with most being at the early globular stage while lagged behind and were between the one and four cell embryo stages with well developed endosperm typical of wild type seeds at these stages . by contrast in zix/zix siliques crossed with either self or wild type pollen up to of the seeds were arrested at the zygotic or one cell embryo stage with less than eight endosperm _LOCATION_ and the suspensors of these one cell embryos did not divide any further in most cases . in addition to of the seeds were arrested at the two to eight cell stage but the endosperm underwent only two or three rounds of division a twofold reduction compared with the more than five divisions of wild type seeds at this stage . in to of the seeds the embryo sac resembled a mature wild type prefertilization embryo sac with no sign of either embryo or endosperm development and thus appeared unfertilized . beyond dap most mutant seeds collapsed . the slight reduction in the male transmission efficiency of zix alleles prompted us to question whether the zix male allele contributes to the delayed growth and early embryo and endosperm postfertilization arrest . however neither aberrant seed phenotypes were observed when heterozygous zix/zix flowers were used as pollen donors on wild type flowers nor was any obvious abnormality observed in zix/zix pollen . introgressing a dna fragment encompassing the genomic _GENE_ locus into plants having any of the three zix alleles rescued the mutant phenotypes in transgenic zix/zix plants carrying additional _GENE_ copy/copies the seed abortion rates were significantly reduced and the transmission of mutant alleles significantly increased in comparison to those of nontransformed zix/zix plants . based on these results we conclude that the disruption of _GENE_ causes the loss of function _PROTEIN_ phenotype in zix/zix plants and that maternal zix promotes early embryo and endosperm development in wild type seeds . _GENE_ is a single copy gene in the arabidopsis genome . searching the nonredundant public databases by blastp with the zix virtual translation sequence uncovered similar proteins across eukaryotic _METHOD_ all sharing a sequence of amino acids at the c terminus of unknown function annotated as ataxin related . the rat homolog of the human protein ataxin which is associated with a cerebellar dysfunction disorder is predicted to belong to the arm repeat protein family the secondary structure of which is arranged into three helical turns interspersed by coils . using the hhpred algorithm we found that the zix secondary structure contains multiple helices connected by coil domains . although only two putative arm repeat motifs similar to the archetypal arm repeat were identified by this algorithm at the n and c termini of zix upon scrutiny of the sequence and the helix alignments we recognized a third arm repeat motif at the zix n terminus . the two best fitting three dimensional models for zix predicted by i tasser and phyre using the presumed zix secondary structure and the protein data bank were importin and catenin . these are the two arm repeat proteins with a known crystal structure the latter being the vertebrate equivalent of the drosophila melanogaster armadillo protein . the finding that the predicted three dimensional structure of zix is similar to these two arm proteins indicates that there could be additional arm domains in the zix protein that were not recognized by the _METHOD_ used because of lower primary sequence homology . based on arabidopsis genevestigator _PROTEIN_ data zix transcripts are present in many different tissues throughout the plant life cycle with the highest _PROTEIN_ levels in seeds especially the endosperm . atproteom detected zix peptides in young roots and young siliques . these results potentially point to diverse roles of zix in various arabidopsis developmental processes in addition to early embryo and endosperm development . we investigated zix _PROTEIN_ specifically in arabidopsis gametophytes and seeds to dap by rna in situ hybridization . zix transcripts were present in pollen and all four cell types of the mature embryo sac as well as in the early embryo and endosperm with the strongest _PROTEIN_ in the prefertilization central cell . thus the _PROTEIN_ of zix is consistent with its functional relevance for early seed development as revealed by the mutant phenotypes . to better understand zix s _PROTEIN_ on early embryo and endosperm development we focused our study on zix _PROTEIN_ in the female gametophyte and early seeds from to dap when the zix phenotypes are manifest . in the zix gus _PROTEIN_ reporter lines gus _PROTEIN_ was prominent in pollen and throughout the development of the female gametophyte from the functional megaspore to the mature embryo sac . in fertilized seeds of reciprocal crosses between the reporter lines and the wild type up to dap activities of the maternal zix promoter were primarily detected in the early embryo and endosperm from the elongated zygote until at least the globular stage . notably there was a pause in maternal zix promoter activity at the early zygote stage before elongation which was preceded by a low level of _PROTEIN_ in the unfertilized egg cell . the paternal zix promoter on the other hand only became active in both the embryo and endosperm from the one cell embryo stage onwards . in some seeds residual gus activity of the ruptured pollen tube in the degenerating synergid space could be observed at the micropyle . furthermore for both parental alleles gus _PROTEIN_ in the suspensor was detected at a _PROTEIN_ stage than in the embryo proper . these results suggest postfertilization de novo _PROTEIN_ of both parental zix alleles in the embryo and of the paternal allele in the endosperm . whether postfertilization maternal zix _PROTEIN_ in the endosperm was due to carryover of prefertilization transcripts from the central cell and/or involved de novo _PROTEIN_ could not be determined due to the continuous presence of gus activity . this parent of origin dependent _PROTEIN_ pattern was observed in both the ler and columbia accessions harboring the zix reporter construct . using a single nucleotide polymorphism of a drai restriction site present in the second exon of zix in the col accession but not in the ler accession we further investigated the parental origin of the endogenous zix transcripts in developing wild type seeds of reciprocal crosses between these two accessions at to dap . the results of rt pcr followed by drai restriction digestion of zix pcr products not only confirmed the preferential maternal postfertilization _PROTEIN_ of zix but also showed an apparent increase of paternal zix transcript levels during early seed development independent of the two genetic backgrounds studied . although we were not yet able to define the experimental parameters for allele specific quantitative pcr to distinguish these two alleles which differ by only a single nucleotide qpcr for total zix _PROTEIN_ levels in fertilized seeds to dap showed that zix _PROTEIN_ normalized to the _PROTEIN_ of the reference gene _PROTEIN_ did not change significantly during this developmental window . this result further underscores that the de novo paternal zix _PROTEIN_ despite increasing gradually was still substantially lower than maternal zix _PROTEIN_ as total zix transcript levels did not increase significantly . to investigate allele specific zix _PROTEIN_ in the developing young embryo we examined the transcriptome rna sequencing data of isolated embryos from previous reports . although the two arabidopsis accessions used in citation are ler and col as in this study maternal and paternal zix transcripts could not be distinguished in this data set . in the report by citation the normalized zix maternal to paternal _PROTEIN_ ratios for one cell/two cell eight cell and cell embryos of the col cape verde islands crosses are and respectively and of the cape verde islands col crosses are and respectively . since these ratios are inconsistent in reciprocal crosses and since different arabidopsis accessions were studied we can not draw any clear conclusion _PROTEIN_ allele specific _PROTEIN_ of zix in the embryo from these data . in conclusion the parent of origin dependent _PROTEIN_ patterns of zix revealed by both promoter reporter and allele specific rt pcr analyses provide the basis of the _PROTEIN_ of the zix mutant during early embryo and endosperm development . the differential _PROTEIN_ of maternal and paternal zix alleles during early seed development raises the question of how parent of origin dependent zix _PROTEIN_ is regulated . we tested several trans acting _PROTEIN_ that were previously shown to repress silenced paternal alleles or to activate _PROTEIN_ maternal alleles of known genes with a _PROTEIN_ on embryo and/or endosperm development . as repression is commonly associated with dna and histone methylation we tested whether the following genes are regulators of parent of origin dependent zix _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes which _PROTEIN_ cg and non cg dna methylation kryptonite _PROTEIN_ which establishes and dna methylation at chg sites and the fis genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which partially repress the paternal _PROTEIN_ allele by . to test whether a paternal hypomethylation background could alleviate paternal zix allele silencing we evaluated the endogenous paternal zix transcript levels by rt pcr in reciprocal crosses using wild type plants and the dna/histone hypomethylated mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and kyp as pollen donors in either the ler or col background . we could not detect any change of paternal zix _PROTEIN_ levels in fertilized seeds up to dap _PROTEIN_ of the mutant and accession used . moreover hypomethylated pollen of these mutants rescued neither the early seed developmental arrest nor the seed abortion phenotype of zix . to examine whether the maternal mea or fie allele could derepress paternal zix we monitored paternal zix promoter activities in mea and fie seeds fertilized by zix gus pollen . as in wild type seeds no paternal zix reactivation was observed . collectively these results indicate that early paternal zix repression in the zygote young embryo and early endosperm is not regulated by the dna and histone methylation pathways mediated by these genes . _PROTEIN_ the regulation of _PROTEIN_ of the maternal zix allele we tested whether the dna glycosylase _PROTEIN_ which demethylates dna is required for activation depending on the context as is the case for both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . we crossed a zix gus line in the col background with the dme mutant and examined maternal zix promoter activity in unfertilized ovules or fertilized seeds of dme zix gus/ plants . fifty percent of the ovules or seeds in pistils of these plants carried the zix gus allele and half of these also contained the dme allele while the other half harbored the wild type _PROTEIN_ allele . we observed that of the unfertilized ovules and of the fertilized seeds at dap showed maternal gus _PROTEIN_ similar to that in the wild type indicating that maternal _PROTEIN_ is not necessary for maternal zix _PROTEIN_ . collectively our results on the zix reproductive phenotype the spatial and temporal _PROTEIN_ of zix and the regulation of its parent of origin dependent _PROTEIN_ pattern establish that zix represents a _PROTEIN_ gene in plants that is not regulated by the pathways known to be involved in the regulation of other _PROTEIN_ loci . we further searched for potential regulators of zix _PROTEIN_ by surveying public arabidopsis epigenome databases for the presence of epigenetic marks at the zix locus . these database compilations integrate genome wide data on dna cytosine methylation histone methylation histone acetylation and ubiquitylation and the presence of small rnas of young seedlings or immature floral tissues . this analysis revealed a low level of dna cytosine methylation at the end of zix only in the cg context while most histone modification marks commonly associated with highly and broadly _PROTEIN_ genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and were present in the zix gene body and in some cases the promoter consistent with the broad _PROTEIN_ pattern of zix . histone modifications associated with genes having a low or tissue specific _PROTEIN_ or with transposons as well as small rnas were absent from the zix locus . whether these epigenetic marks display a similar distribution at the zix locus in the gametophytes embryo and endosperm is not known . in the future determining the epigenetic landscape in these reproductive tissues will bring us a step closer to understanding the regulation of parent of origin dependent _PROTEIN_ of zix and other genes with a _PROTEIN_ . to study the subcellular localization of the zix protein we introduced a zix green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ translational fusion construct driven by the native zix promoter _METHOD_ into wild type ler plants . this fusion protein was functional as the construct significantly increased zix allele transmission in zix/zix plants indicating successful complementation of the mutant phenotype . corroborating the _PROTEIN_ analysis of the zix gus reporter lines in addition to _PROTEIN_ throughout female gametophyte development zix _METHOD_ was also detected in the vegetative cell but not the sperm cells of pollen . on the other hand zix _METHOD_ was observed in accessory as well as gametic cells of the mature embryo sac . in seeds zix _METHOD_ was detected from the one cell embryo stage and two _LOCATION_ endosperm stage to at least the early heart stage . the absence of zix _METHOD_ in the zygote was in agreement with the absence of zix promoter activity at this stage . furthermore as reported by the atproteom database zix transcripts and zix _METHOD_ proteins were also observed in roots in particular at the zones with active cellular proliferation _PROTEIN_ . in all cases zix _METHOD_ was localized in both the cytoplasm and the _LOCATION_ implicating zix in various cellular processes in which arm proteins are known to play a role . the presence of zix in actively dividing root tissues and the slow growth and early arrest of zix seeds suggest a link between zix function and cell cycle regulation . thus we examined whether the maternal zix mutant allele affects the _PROTEIN_ of two arabidopsis cell cycle genes origin of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and cyclin _PROTEIN_ kinase _PROTEIN_ . as both genes are biparentally active soon after fertilization they could be studied in zix mutants prior to the early zix developmental arrest . _PROTEIN_ is a subunit of the arabidopsis origin of replication complex and disruption of the gene leads to zygotic lethality due to embryo and endosperm arrest after a couple of cell cycles . mutated _PROTEIN_ a cyclin dependent kinase results in a delay of the second mitotic division of the generative cell such that the sperm cells are only produced during pollen tube growth consequently only the sperm fertilizing the egg cell contributes its genome to the developing fertilization products while the second sperm fertilizing the central cell does not . to examine the paternal allele _PROTEIN_ of these genes in zix seeds we monitored their promoter activities of the promoter gene _METHOD_ or gus lines used as pollen donors in crosses with zix/zix flowers . to study the maternal allele _PROTEIN_ of these genes in zix seeds we examined reporter gene _PROTEIN_ in a zix embryo sac fertilized by wild type sperm cells . no aberrant _PROTEIN_ of either parental allele of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ reporters was detected in the zygote one cell embryo and early endosperm of zix ovules at dap indicating that these genes are not regulated by zix . overexpression of zix driven by the promoter in wild type plants did not confer any overgrowth phenotype of any tissues and organs . therefore an association of zix with cell cycle regulation can not be established from these results . whether other cell cycle genes functioning in early embryo and endosperm are affected by a lack of maternal zix _PROTEIN_ remains an open question . alternatively zix might not be associated with cell cycle regulation but rather with the competency to divide . a well characterized function of arm proteins is their role as coactivators in conjunction with other transcription _PROTEIN_ that initiate gene _PROTEIN_ of cellular proliferation and differentiation pathways . therefore we evaluated whether the early biallelic _PROTEIN_ of two transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ early in the endosperm and/or embryo _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was affected in zix seeds . mutants disrupting either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ show precocious endosperm cellularization . we examined the parental promoter activities of reporter lines for these genes in zix mutants as described above for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . at dap _PROTEIN_ did not show any difference in parental _PROTEIN_ in zix compared with wild type seeds of a similar developmental stage . on the other hand although the paternal _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in zix seeds was indistinguishable from that of wild type seeds of a similar stage maternal _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was lost or strongly reduced in zix seeds suggesting that _PROTEIN_ acts downstream of zix at least during early embryo and endosperm development . however this loss of maternal _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ alone is unlikely to be responsible for the _PROTEIN_ of zix as _PROTEIN_ does not display a maternal effect on its own . yet when combined with the misregulation of other genes _PROTEIN_ could be a contributing _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ effects of zix on _PROTEIN_ dependent endosperm differentiation are likely but can not be evaluated due to the early _PROTEIN_ seed abortion phenotype of zix .
