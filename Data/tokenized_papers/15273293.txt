in higher plants photorespiratory gly oxidation in leaf mitochondria yields ammonium in large amounts . mitochondrial ammonium must somehow be recovered as glutamate in chloroplasts . as the first step in that recovery we report glutamine synthetase activity in highly purified arabidopsis thaliana mitochondria isolated from light _PROTEIN_ leaf tissue . leaf mitochondrial gs activity is further induced in response to either physiological _PROTEIN_ limitation or transient darkness . historically whether mitochondria are fully competent for oxidative phosphorylation in actively photorespiring leaves has remained uncertain . here we report that light _PROTEIN_ intact leaf mitochondria supplied with gly as sole energy source are fully competent for oxidative phosphorylation . purified intact mitochondria efficiently use gly oxidation _PROTEIN_ to drive conversion of l orn to l citrulline an _PROTEIN_ dependent process . an a. thaliana genome wide search for _LOCATION_ gene encoding mitochondrial gs activity yielded a single candidate _PROTEIN_ . stably transgenic a. thaliana ecotype columbia plants _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ chimeric reporter were constructed . when observed by laser scanning confocal microscopy leaf mesophyll and epidermal tissue of transgenic plants showed punctate _METHOD_ _METHOD_ that colocalized with mitochondria . in immunoblot experiments a kd chimeric _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein was present in both leaf mitochondria and chloroplasts of these stably transgenic plants . therefore the _PROTEIN_ gene product heretofore labeled _LOCATION_ gs functions in both leaf mitochondria and chloroplasts to faciliate ammonium recovery during photorespiration .
in previous experiments functioning a. thaliana ecotype col leaf chloroplasts were purified using gs activity assay as chloroplast marker . elution profiles of percoll gradients used for chloroplast purification reproducibly yielded gs activity peaks in multiple gradient fractions . to follow up these observations leaf mitochondria from both light and dark _PROTEIN_ a. thaliana col plants were highly purified by repeated velocity sedimentation in percoll solutions . under both bright field and _METHOD_ microscopy highly purified leaf mitochondria were essentially homogenous and entirely lacked intact chloroplasts . in biochemical tests these purified leaf mitochondria showed high succinate dehydrogenase specific activities . light _PROTEIN_ purified leaf mitochondria and chloroplasts were lysed by a combination of ultrasonication and osmotic dilution . both soluble _PROTEIN_ and envelope fractions were recovered after centrifugation . total gs activity measured was some fold higher in osmotically lysed mitochondria relative to osmotically protected mitochondria suggesting substantial gs activity within . upon further testing gs activity in _PROTEIN_ fractions was present at high levels gs activity in envelope fractions was absent . conversely when root mitochondria were similarly purified little or no gs activity in any mitochondrial subfraction was observed . gs specific activities in light _PROTEIN_ leaf mitochondria were reproducibly some fourfold higher when compared with leaf chloroplasts . gln synthetase activity in purified a. thaliana organelles to assess whether significant gs activity in leaf or root mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ fractions was masked gs was partially purified by deae sepharose chromatography . for leaf mitochondria between and of total gs activity was recovered in column eluates . for light _PROTEIN_ mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ preparations gs activity was eluted in two discrete peaks corresponding to different kcl concentrations . for dark _PROTEIN_ mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ fractions no increase in total gs activity was obtained after deae sepharose chromatography . therefore dark _PROTEIN_ mitochondrial gs activity was neither inhibited nor masked in mitochondrial lysates . _PROTEIN_ fractions obtained from isolated root mitochondria were also subjected to deae sepharose chromatography no significant gs activity in column eluates was observed . to test diurnal regulation a. thaliana plants shifted to darkness for varying times were harvested and leaf mitochondria and chloroplasts were isolated and purified . in dark shifted mitochondria gs activity was stable and further increased over the h dark period . a. thaliana gs possesses two cys residues cys and cys absent in _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ but highly conserved in _LOCATION_ gs of all tested _METHOD_ . as evidenced by site specific mutageneses both cys and cys are critical for light stability presumably internal oxidative disulfide bond formation between cys and cys results in loss of _LOCATION_ gs activity . conceivably stable gs activity in dark shifted a. thaliana mitochondria might be owed to thioredoxin activity which would both _PROTEIN_ cys sulfhydryl groups chemically reduced and prevent formation of any internal disulfide bonds . in turn mitochondrial thioredoxin activity presupposes dark respiration . to test photorespiratory regulation a. thaliana plants growing in a h photoperiod at high light intensity were _PROTEIN_ at the end of the normal h light period under continuous light and shifted to either ambient _PROTEIN_ or diminished _PROTEIN_ atmosphere . at h intervals plants were collected and both leaf mitochondria and chloroplasts were purified . gs activities from leaf organelles of plants _PROTEIN_ at ambient _PROTEIN_ were similar over this time course . gs activities from leaf organelles of plants shifted to limiting _PROTEIN_ showed marked increases . chloroplast gs activities jumped almost fourfold in h whereas leaf mitochondrial activities showed a slower but steady time dependent increase . therefore organellar gs activity in both chloroplasts and mitochondria was further induced by photorespiratory stress . in terrestrial plants whole tissue photosynthetic evolution rates measured as a function of light intensity typically show a discontinuity initially thought to result from high light inhibition of mitochondrial respiration . thereafter corroborative experiments seemed to imply that leaf mitochondria were not fully competent for oxidative phosphorylation in the light . subsequently however light _PROTEIN_ mitochondria from photosynthetic tissues were shown capable of rapid gly dependent oxidative phosphorylation in pea and in barley . as part of the photorespiratory _PROTEIN_ cycle mitochondrial gly decarboxylase activity generates ammonium at very high rates . in principle mitochondrial gs activity might help reassimilate this ammonium . to resolve this uncertainty freshly purified light _PROTEIN_ intact a. thaliana leaf mitochondria were tested for ability to drive the conversion of l orn to l citrulline in a coupled assay system using either gly or l malate as an energy source . in initial experiments little activity was observed . however when coupled assays were supplemented with l glutamate adp and nad significant activity was observed . in principle these three cosubstrates should be regenerated and thus need be supplied at only catalytic levels . to the contrary efficient coupling required addition of all three metabolites albeit at submillimolar levels . the mitochondrial requirement for l glutamate adp and nad supplementation may imply leakage of these intermediates during purification and/or assay . conversion of l orn to l citrulline by purified intact leaf mitochondria in coupled assays with intact osmotically protected mitochondria gly when added as sole energy _PROTEIN_ and n substrate sustained l orn dependent l citrulline production at high rates whereas added l malate or a mixture of both gly and l malate supported this coupled process poorly . also dark _PROTEIN_ leaf mitochondria also converted l orn to l citrulline as a gly dependent process at similar rates . in all cases measured l citrulline was quantitatively exported . when assay mixtures were pelleted by centrifugation and pellets lysed by osmotic dilution > of total l citrulline was present in the supernatant fraction and < was present in the mitochondrial pellet . coupled activity required freshly isolated osmotically stabilized leaf mitochondria . even when stored on wet ice mitochondria lost of coupled activity within several hours coupled activity was completely lost upon overnight storage whether mitochondria were stored on wet ice or at . gly dependent conversion of l orn to l citrulline was approximately linear over a min time course at implying a steady state coupled process . indeed because conversion of l orn to l citrulline slowed in the presence of both gly and l malate efficient coupling was important for high level activity . because mitochondria require additional catalytic activities to convert l orn to l citrulline a functional genomic analysis was undertaken . in the first step candidate gene products were identified after systematic searches of the a. thaliana genome . the candidate genes were exclusively of _LOCATION_ origin no putative participating organellar genes were identified . next these _LOCATION_ gene products were analyzed for organelle targeting n terminal peptides using the psort algorithm . a collection of a. thaliana _LOCATION_ gene products with appropriate mitochondrial presequences was identified . this tabulation included the following mitochondria targeted activities gly decarboxylase gly ser hydroxymethyltransferase gs _PROTEIN_ anhydrase gln dependent _PROTEIN_ synthetase and orn _PROTEIN_ activities . a. thaliana _LOCATION_ gene products with mitochondrial presequences or chloroplast transit peptides able to participate in the gly dependent interconversion of l orn and l citrulline a comprehensive search of the a. thaliana genome also yielded a family of five paralogous _LOCATION_ genes x encoding _LOCATION_ gs _METHOD_ . from multiple alignments these kd proteins all show > homology . in addition a sixth _LOCATION_ gene _PROTEIN_ encoding _LOCATION_ gs was identified . in contrast with the gs family gs comprises a kd protein with uniquely among this family a residue n terminal trafficking peptide . correspondingly five distinct a. thaliana gs genes were previously identified from cdna analysis of polyadenylated mrna preparations . from rna gel blot analysis of this gene family _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ proved both leaf specific and light inducible . indeed in various terrestrial higher plants _LOCATION_ gs activity is both light inducible and dark unstable . the psort algorithm identified the residue n terminal peptide of the _PROTEIN_ precursor as a mitochondrial presequence . to further this analysis the n terminal trafficking peptides of orthologous _LOCATION_ gs precursor _METHOD_ representing various terrestrial plants were likewise analyzed . psort certified all as trafficking peptides . obligated by program instructions to make unambiguous calls on each psort called of the mitochondrial presequences and chloroplast stromal transit peptides . in several cases psort made alternate calls in response to single residue changes of the n terminal trafficking peptides . organellar gs gene products might the _PROTEIN_ gene encode the measured leaf mitochondrial gs activity ? to test this hypothesis stably transgenic a. thaliana plants _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ reporter were constructed as follows . in vitro an np fragment of a. thaliana col genomic dna encoding the first residues of the gs precursor was amplified by pcr . this pcr fragment was then spliced into yielding an in frame _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ translational fusion whose _PROTEIN_ was driven by the promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus . this ligation mixture was used to transform escherichia coli competent cells to kanamycin resistance and the desired recombinant plasmid was identified by pcr analysis . both plasmid and its parent were used to electroporate agrobacterium tumefaciens _PROTEIN_ again selecting kanamycin resistance the a. tumefaciens _PROTEIN_ derivative was verified by pcr analysis . in vivo inflorescence _METHOD_ of a. thaliana col plants were inoculated with induced a. tumefaciens _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ cultures by vacuum infiltration . generation seed was collected from self fertilized inoculated plants and germinated aseptically on defined medium containing hygromycin b . resistant seedlings were identified transplanted to soil and propagated normally . ten independent stably transgenic a. thaliana lines carrying the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct derived from were identified analyzed and propagated . ten independent stable transgenic a. thaliana lines carrying _METHOD_ derived from the vector were similarly identified and propagated . stably transgenic lines and carrying the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct and line carrying the unadulterated _METHOD_ reporter _PROTEIN_ were propagated and harvested in the light and leaf tissue was examined by laser scanning confocal microscopy . in ventral epidermal cells and mesophyll cells of line strong punctate green _METHOD_ was evident . green _METHOD_ originated from subcellular ellipsoids some in length . leaf mesophyll cells also showed punctate green _METHOD_ whose size and shape and subcellular distribution was consistent with mitochondria . by contrast mesophyll chloroplasts showed red _METHOD_ but no green _METHOD_ possibly owed to quenching by accessory photopigments . in plants carrying the unadulterated _METHOD_ reporter green _METHOD_ was diffuse not punctate . when microscopic sections of line leaves carrying the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct were then infused min with a nm aqueous solution of mitotracker red dye colocalization of green and red punctate _METHOD_ was observed . therefore mitochondria were inferred as source of punctate green _METHOD_ in leaves of line plants . consequently a. thaliana gs precursor is targeted to mitochondria . both mitochondria and chloroplasts were highly purified from leaf tissue of light _PROTEIN_ a. thaliana generation plants corresponding to transgenic lines and . soluble protein enriched fractions for both organelles were obtained after deae sepharose chromatography and step elution with high ionic strength buffer . protein enriched _PROTEIN_ and stromal samples were analyzed for _METHOD_ cross reacting material by immunoblotting using conventional protein gel blot analysis . in stably transgenic lines and _PROTEIN_ the chimeric _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ reporter both stromal and _PROTEIN_ fractions showed an _METHOD_ cross reacting protein . the measured molecular _METHOD_ kd of the _METHOD_ cross reacting protein was that expected for chimeric _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein . in the two independent lines absolute levels of chimeric _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ varied markedly . by contrast in transgenic line carrying the _METHOD_ reporter absent any n terminal fusion _METHOD_ cross reacting material was absent in both protein enriched _PROTEIN_ and stromal fractions . to assess for cross contamination of purified chloroplasts and mitochondria chloroplast stromal fractions and mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ fractions were also _PROTEIN_ with either stromal specific or _PROTEIN_ specific antisera . chloroplast stromal fractions of all strains cross reacted with a polyclonal antiserum prepared against purified h. vulgare ribulose bisphosphate _PROTEIN_ . strong signals corresponding to rubisco large subunit and weak signals from small subunit were both observed . mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ preparations did not detectably cross react with rubisco serum . conversely mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ fractions of all strains specifically cross reacted with _PROTEIN_ specific polyclonal antiserum prepared against a. thaliana gly decarboxylase complex p protein chloroplast stromal fractions did not . therefore chimeric _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was present in both leaf mitochondria and chloroplasts of stably transgenic plants .
