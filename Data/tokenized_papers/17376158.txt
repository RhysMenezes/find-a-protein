anion transporting proteins of the clc type are involved in anion homeostasis in a variety of _METHOD_ . clcs from arabidopsis have been shown to participate in nitrate accumulation and storage . in this study the physiological role of the functional chloride transporter atclc d from arabidopsis was investigated . atclc d is weakly _PROTEIN_ in various tissues including the root . when transiently _PROTEIN_ as a _METHOD_ fusion in protoplasts it co localized with the vha subunit of the proton transporting v type _PROTEIN_ in the trans _LOCATION_ network . stable _PROTEIN_ in plants showed that it co localized with the endocytic tracer dye in a brefeldin a sensitive compartment . immunogold electron microscopy confirmed the localization of atclc d to the tgn . disruption of the atclc d gene by a t dna insertion did not affect the nitrate and chloride contents . the overall morphology of these clcd plants was similar to that of the wild type but root growth on synthetic medium was impaired . moreover the sensitivity of hypocotyl elongation to treatment with concanamycin a a blocker of the v _PROTEIN_ was stronger in the clcd mutant . these phenotypes could be complemented by overexpression of atclc d in the mutant background . the results suggest that the luminal ph in the trans _LOCATION_ network is adjusted by atclc d mediated transport of a counter anion such as or .
to analyze the _PROTEIN_ pattern of atclc d a kb fragment of the _PROTEIN_ was cloned in front of the _PROTEIN_ gene . the construct was transformed into arabidopsis and the promoter activity was assayed in two independent homozygous lines from the generation . promoter activity was most prominent in the root of germinating seedlings and in cotyledons of day old seedlings . although differential _PROTEIN_ was observed a weak staining indicating weak promoter activity was observed in most plant organs . in older plants stronger staining was observed in the hydathodes and in flowers especially in anthers and pollen . _PROTEIN_ pattern of atclc d in arabidopsis . staining pattern of homozygous plants _PROTEIN_ a kb promoter fragment fused to gus in day old day old and day old seedlings plus hydathodes and flowers . overall _PROTEIN_ pattern in day old plants . the numbers indicate days after germination . a homozygous t dna insertion line in the col ecotype was isolated from the salk collection . the t dna insertion was within the fourth intron of the atclc d gene and initial hybridization with an antisense probe covering the terminal fragment of atclc d showed that this fragment was overexpressed in clcd . such overexpression of transcripts in lines from the salk collection is not unprecedented as the t dna harbors a promoter which drives _PROTEIN_ of genes located close to the left border . however the partial transcript lacks the coding information for the first three transmembrane helices of atclc d. proteins that might be formed from this transcript are unlikely to be functional . subsequent northern blot hybridization with a probe confirmed that the full transcript was only detected in wild type plants but not in the homozygous clcd mutant . the part of the transcript and the fragment covering the t dna insertion were not detectable using rt pcr which confirmed that the atclc d transcript was at least strongly reduced if not abolished in clcd . rt pcr with primers covering the fragment of the gene confirmed the strong _PROTEIN_ of the fragment of the partial atclc d transcript in the clcd line . the resistance to kanamycin of progeny obtained from selfed heterozygous plants with a clcd allele segregated roughly indicating a single t dna insertion in clcd mutants . isolation of a t dna insertion line for atclc d. schematic position of the insertion in the intron and location of primers . exons are indicated as black boxes . the indicated primers were used for genotypic screening . rt pcr showing absence of the full transcript but _PROTEIN_ of the fragment of the transcript in the clcd line . northern blot hybridization with total rna from wt and homozygous clcd plants confirming loss of the part of the transcript in the mutant line . growth and development of homozygous clcd plants was undistinguishable from that of wild type plants on soil . plants did not show developmental defects under long or short day conditions and germinated and grew normally on agar supplemented with various concentrations of nitrate or chloride . plants grown on soil or on agar media supplemented with mm _PROTEIN_ or mm nacl did not have altered chloride and nitrate concentrations compared with the wild type . these results suggest that atclc d is not involved in overall anion homeostasis or that atclc d function is redundant in arabidopsis . anion profile of day old col and homozygous clcd plants grown on various synthetic agar media . nitrate and chloride concentrations per fresh weight for plants grown in the absence of nacl on mm or mm as the sole nitrogen source or on mm supplemented with mm nacl . the results are means and _PROTEIN_ for triplicate determinations . similar data were obtained in an independent experiment . transient _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts resulted in localization of an atclc d _METHOD_ fusion in small dots that were distributed throughout the cytoplasm . atclc d did not co localize with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which localizes to an endosomal compartment . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ belongs to the family of rab type _PROTEIN_ and has been implicated in _LOCATION_ trafficking . in contrast atclc d _METHOD_ partially co localized with the rat sialyl transferase _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ that is localized to trans _LOCATION_ cisternae and the tgn . the qa snare _PROTEIN_ has been identified in the tgn . in many protoplasts a strict co localization was observed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . however the pattern of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ marker in transiently _PROTEIN_ protoplasts was not entirely consistent and varied somewhat between different protoplasts . an intense overall red _METHOD_ and less pronounced co localization were also observed with this marker . furthermore co localization was observed with co _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ tagged vha subunit of v _PROTEIN_ . the co localization was not only visible in individual confocal sections but was also identified in reconstructions of cell sections . a maximum projection of part of a cell is shown in . punctate _METHOD_ structures were also observed in root cells of stably transformed atclc d _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants . due to the weak activity of the endogenous promoter of atclc d _METHOD_ the camv promoter was used to drive _PROTEIN_ . the _METHOD_ obtained from such plants was always rather weak both in the and generations . co localization of atclc d with tgn markers in protoplasts . confocal laser scanning microscopy of atclc d _METHOD_ showing punctate _METHOD_ . staining patterns of co transformed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the _METHOD_ labeled vha subunit of v _PROTEIN_ . overlays are shown in and bright field images in . scale bars . maximum projection of serial sections of part of a protoplast co _PROTEIN_ atclc d _METHOD_ and vha _METHOD_ . immunogold labeling of ultra thin cryosections on root tissue was performed using an anti _METHOD_ antibody to confirm the above results . transmission electron microscopy revealed consistent staining of tubulovesicular structures close to the trans site of the _LOCATION_ stacks . gold particles labeled the same structures which represent the tgn in vha _METHOD_ plants but not in controls not _PROTEIN_ atclc d _METHOD_ . in both cases no staining was observed on the _LOCATION_ itself . the results are consistent with a preferential localization of atclc d in the trans _LOCATION_ network . immunogold labeling of ultra thin root cryosections of plants stably _PROTEIN_ atclc d _METHOD_ . anti _METHOD_ antibodies were detected with silver enhanced nanogold . gold particles accumulated in the tgn region close to the trans _LOCATION_ cisternae of cortex and epidermal cells of root tips . the trans _LOCATION_ side is marked with and is always shown on the lower side of the _LOCATION_ stack . no labeling above background was seen in controls not _PROTEIN_ atclc d _METHOD_ . labeling in plants stably _PROTEIN_ vha _METHOD_ . scale bar nm . endosomal vesicles aggregate upon treatment with the fungal toxin brefeldin a which blocks certain adp ribosylation _PROTEIN_ guanidine nucleotide exchange _PROTEIN_ involved in _LOCATION_ trafficking . early endosomes may accumulate in the core while trans _LOCATION_ markers may arrange at the periphery of such bfa compartments . the punctate _METHOD_ from atclc d _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants was lost after incubating with bfa for h but an aggregate of _METHOD_ in the center of each cell was observed . furthermore the lipophilic styryl dye a widely used tracer for endocytic _LOCATION_ trafficking co localized with atclc d _METHOD_ . after the addition of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ rapidly stained red . punctate red _METHOD_ was additionally apparent after a few minutes . these punctate structures partially overlapped with the atclc d _METHOD_ _METHOD_ dots in confocal microscopic sections . this is consistent with atclc d _METHOD_ residing in an early endocytic compartment identical to the tgn . brefeldin a sensitivity and co localization with the endocytic marker in root cells . _METHOD_ and bright field images of stably atclc d _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plant roots . untreated control treatment with bfa . scale bar . green atclc d _METHOD_ _METHOD_ red labeling and overlay taken after min and in a different experiment after about min . scale bars . as atclc d co localized with the vha subunit of v _PROTEIN_ we tested whether clcd mutant plant growth was affected at different ph . wild type root growth was maximal at acidic ph consistent with an important role for the acidic rhizosphere ph in plant growth . in contrast plant development was entirely impaired on agar plates that were buffered with mm mes at neutral ph . compared with the wild type the mutant clcd plants had a slightly reduced root length which was fully restored in ectopic atclc d _METHOD_ overexpressors in the null background . taking into account the rapid exchange of lipid dye and _LOCATION_ between the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the atclc d _METHOD_ positive early endocytic compartment the external ph may have affected the ph homeostasis . importantly complementation of the clcd plants with _METHOD_ tagged atclc d suggests that the tag did not affect its physiological function and localization . root growth at acidic ph in the clcd line and complementation by ectopic overexpression of atclc d _METHOD_ . representative root length of seedlings after days . lower panel statistical analysis of primary root length . the root length was calculated from three independent experiments _PROTEIN_ . more than seedlings were analyzed in each experiment . v _PROTEIN_ is required for cell elongation a phenomenon that is apparent from the dwarf phenotype in the _PROTEIN_ mutant that shows a partial v _PROTEIN_ loss . inhibition of v _PROTEIN_ by concanamycin a a specific inhibitor similarly impaired the hypocotyl elongation of etiolated seedlings in a dose dependent manner . to confirm a more direct link between a functional v _PROTEIN_ and atclc d the effect of concanamycin a on hypocotyl elongation was assayed in clcd and wild type plants . in day old dark germinated seedlings the hypocotyls of clcd plants were of similar length when germinated on pure agar in the dark and when the ph of the medium was adjusted to ph or . in contrast clcd hypocotyls were shorter than wild type when the v _PROTEIN_ was partially blocked by concanamycin a proving a close cooperativity of the proton pump and atclc d. this phenotype was complemented by _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ tagged atclc d construct under the control of the promoter . impaired hypocotyl elongation by loss of atclc d and by treatment with concanamycin a. normalized hypocotyl length of wild type day old seedlings clcd mutant and two ectopic atclc d _METHOD_ overexpressers in the clcd background without concanamycin a and with or concanamycin a . the number of hypocotyls analyzed in this particular experiment is shown in parentheses on the top of each bar . means and _PROTEIN_ are given and were statistically different between clcd and the other lines upon treatment with concanamycin a . similar differences between wild type and clcd were observed in four independent experiments the results for one of these are shown . although absolute values of hypocotyl length were almost identical for wild type and clcd in the absence on concanamycin a normalized values are given here for better display . absolute hypocotyl lengths were wild type clcd complemented clcd and .
