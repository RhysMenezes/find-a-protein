eukaryotic sugar transporters of the mfs and sweet superfamilies consist of and helical transmembrane domains _METHOD_ respectively . structural analyses indicate that mfs transporters evolved from a series of tandem duplications of an ancestral tm unit . sweets are heptahelical proteins carrying a tandem repeat of tm separated by a single tm . here we show that prokaryotes have ancestral sweet homologs with only tm and that the bradyrhizobium japonicum like arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ mediates sucrose transport . eukaryotic sweets most likely evolved by internal duplication of the tm suggesting that semisweets form oligomers to create a functional pore . however it remains elusive whether the tm sweets are the functional unit or require oligomerization to form a pore sufficiently large to allow for sucrose passage . split ubiquitin yeast two hybrid and split _METHOD_ assays indicate that arabidopsis sweets homo and heterooligomerize . we examined mutant sweet variants for negative dominance to test if oligomerization is necessary for function . mutation of the conserved or in _PROTEIN_ led to loss of activity . coexpression of the defective mutants with functional a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ inhibited _PROTEIN_ transport indicating that homooligomerization is necessary for function . collectively these data imply that the basic unit of sweets similar to mfs sugar transporters is a tm unit and that a functional transporter contains at least four such domains . we hypothesize that the functional unit of the sweet family of transporters possesses a structure resembling the tm mfs structure however with a parallel orientation of the tm unit .
to investigate whether prokaryotic genomes carry sweet homologs extensive blast and pfam searches were conducted . over homologs from different prokaryotic genera were identified . a phylogenetic tree was constructed with one representative homolog from each genus . most of the homologs belong to the pq loop family and contain a single pq loop motif which is embedded in a tm structure . by contrast pq loop members in eukaryotes such as the sweets have tm an internal repeat of the tm unit and each one contains one pq loop motif . because of their structure the prokaryotic homologs were named semisweets . the proteins are found widely dispersed across the prokaryotic kingdom including archaea and eubacteria . we did not observe a consistent pattern of semisweet association with other genes across all _METHOD_ but we did find some of the bacterial pq loop genes located in sugar metabolism related operons _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to test whether semisweets transport sugars orfs for eight semisweet homologs geobacter metallireducens cyanothece sp . rhodothermus marinus thermodesulfovibrio yellowstonii treponema denticola lactobacillus casei and nostoc sp were amplified and cloned into a gateway entry vector . inserts were mobilized into destination vectors for _PROTEIN_ in oocytes cells and yeast cells . we did not observe _PROTEIN_ uptake activity in any of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . however when coexpressed with an fret sucrose sensor in human cells a system previously used to identify plant and animal sweets sucrose uptake activity was detected for from b. japonicum usda . we also did not observe _PROTEIN_ uptake activity when _PROTEIN_ in a yeast hexose transport mutant . sweets do not seem to use a proton coupled transport mechanism and thus are considered to function as uniporters . as uniporters sweets could function in sucrose efflux down a concentration gradient . a variety of cyanobacterial species accumulate high levels of _LOCATION_ sucrose as an osmolyte under conditions of osmotic stress and this property has been exploited for the production of _PROTEIN_ feed stocks from cyanobacteria . we tested the sucrose efflux capacity of sweets by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and semisweets in synechococcus elongatus pcc and measuring the accumulation of _LOCATION_ sucrose in cyanobacterial cultures exposed to osmotic stress . sweet _PROTEIN_ cyanobacteria were grown for h under continuous light and nacl was added to induce the accumulation of _LOCATION_ sucrose available for efflux . the results show that and _PROTEIN_ function as sucrose effluxers . _PROTEIN_ seemed slightly more effective at exporting sucrose particularly at low osmotic pressures . together the data from two different _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ show that bradyrhizobium similar to its plant _PROTEIN_ counterpart can mediate cellular sucrose uptake and efflux . because the tm containing was sufficient for sucrose transport activity in both cyanobacterial and human cells and because _METHOD_ are insufficient to form a functional pore that can conduct sucrose it is likely that semisweets dimerize to create a functional pore similar to the tm sweets . to address this question the first and second _METHOD_ of the tm _PROTEIN_ transporter _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ separately in yeast each half contains one tm _PROTEIN_ motif . the first half contained tm helices whereas helices were used as the second half . when the tm halves were _PROTEIN_ separately in the yeast hexose transport mutant neither of them alone could transport _PROTEIN_ . however transport activity was reconstituted when the two halves were coexpressed indicating a functional interaction between the two separately _PROTEIN_ domains . could not substitute the function of either of the halves of _PROTEIN_ although its tm unit is closely related to both _PROTEIN_ halves . interestingly although the fourth tm is the least conserved among the tm of the sweet family and thus is considered to serve as a linker that helps orient the repeat units in a parallel configuration attachment of to the first tm half of _PROTEIN_ seemed essential additional analysis showed that _METHOD_ does not seem to be targeted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but rather accumulates in intracellular compartments of yeast . together these results support the hypothesis that semisweets form at least dimers to assume a configuration similar as in structure of eukaryotic sweets to assemble a functional sugar translocating pore . given that other known sugar transporters of the mfs family are built from tm one may hypothesize that tm may be insufficient to form a pore large enough to allow for sucrose transport . it is therefore conceivable that sweets function as higher order oligomers whereas semisweets function as tetramers . to directly test the ability of tm semisweets and tm sweets to form homo or heterooligomers interactions were tested systematically using the mating based split ubiquitin assay . all arabidopsis sweets and bjsemisweet were fused c terminally to nubg or cub _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . nubwt and nubg were used as positive and negative controls respectively to test the affinity to cub sweets or cub bjsemisweet in parallel because some constructs are able to autoactivate . the interactions were tested on synthetic dextrose media by monitoring yeast cell growth . bjsemisweet is capable of forming a homooligomer in yeast . homooligomerization of bjsemisweet was also observed in the split _METHOD_ system in total sweet interaction pairs were observed . eight sweets _PROTEIN_ showed autoactivation when _PROTEIN_ as cub fusions and therefore initially could not be scored . because cub fusions are _PROTEIN_ from the methionine repressible _PROTEIN_ promoter increasing the amount of methionine in the media _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ level of cub fusions thereby increasing the interaction stringency . application of methionine did not completely inhibit autoactivation of six sweet cubs _PROTEIN_ whereas two sweet cubs _PROTEIN_ showed significantly reduced autoactivation . a total of more sweet interaction pairs was identified under the more stringent media conditions . the analysis indicates that at least eight of the sweets can form homooligomers also we observed heterooligomers . because both insufficient _PROTEIN_ levels and autoactivation restrict the testable combinations we likely underestimate the number of possible interactions . to independently test interactions using an orthologous assay and determine whether the interactions can also occur in planta oligomerization was tested for pairs using the split _METHOD_ assay . the proximal half of the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and c proximal half of the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were fused to the c terminus of five different atsweets _PROTEIN_ and fusion proteins were transiently coexpressed in nicotiana benthamiana leaves . the split _METHOD_ data confirm that sweets can form homooligomers specifically for _PROTEIN_ and . by contrast homooligomerization of _PROTEIN_ was not observed in the split _METHOD_ assay . interestingly _PROTEIN_ was found to form homooligomers in planta whereas no oligomerization was detected in the yeast two hybrid system . importantly all interactions seemed to occur at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ except for _PROTEIN_ for which interactions were observed in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and vesicular compartments . the localization in endogenous _LOCATION_ compartments is consistent with other transient _PROTEIN_ analyses performed with an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion in arabidopsis protoplasts but it contrasts with data obtained in stably transformed arabidopsis transformants . it is likely that overexpression of sweet _METHOD_ fusions in protoplasts or tobacco can lead to mistargeting . together our results support the hypothesis that sweet proteins form homo or heterooligomeric complexes . one way of analyzing the necessity of dimerization for function is to test whether nonfunctional _METHOD_ of the protein can inactivate functional transporters . as a first step to testing negative dominance it was necessary to identify transport deficient mutants . we rationalized that highly conserved residues may be important for activity . analysis of alignments of sweets selected from different plant species identified highly conserved amino acid residues . six positions _PROTEIN_ in three different tm were selected for site directed mutagenesis . _PROTEIN_ transport activity was tested by _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ uptake deficient yeast strain and subsequent monitoring of growth of yeast colonies on media containing _PROTEIN_ as the sole _PROTEIN_ source . four mutations _PROTEIN_ abolished _PROTEIN_ transport activity whereas the other two mutants seemed unaffected . to exclude that the lack of complementation is caused by a trafficking defect that leads to reduced accumulation of the sweet protein at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ we localized c terminal _METHOD_ fusions using confocal microscopy in yeast . we were able to confirm previous reports showing that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions localize to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of yeast and retain _PROTEIN_ transport activity . _METHOD_ fusions of wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and were all detectable at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . by contrast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed significantly reduced _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization whereas _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulated predominantly in intracellular compartments . _PROTEIN_ and were characterized by loss transport activity although _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization seemed unaffected indicating that these mutations led to nonfunctional transporters . loss of _PROTEIN_ transport activity of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may be caused either solely by mistargeting of proteins or by both loss of transport/dimerization capacity and targeting defects . to test whether the nonfunctional _PROTEIN_ mutants interact and inhibit the activity of coexpressed functional transporters _PROTEIN_ was coexpressed with each of four nonfunctional mutants _PROTEIN_ . wild type _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ from the strong _PROTEIN_ promoter whereas the mutants were _PROTEIN_ from the strong _PROTEIN_ promoter . analysis of yeast colony growth on the media with _PROTEIN_ as the sole _PROTEIN_ source showed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ led to slightly reduced _PROTEIN_ transport activity whereas _PROTEIN_ and dramatically inhibited wild type _PROTEIN_ activity . based on the localization of the mutants we can differentiate two types of negative dominance coexpression of _PROTEIN_ with a functional sweet results in the complete loss of _PROTEIN_ activity perhaps caused by oligomerization within the trafficking pathway leading to retention of the transporter and supporting notion that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ functional homooligomers . importantly _PROTEIN_ which seemed unaffected with respect to _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ targeting also inhibited _PROTEIN_ activity when coexpressed with wild type transporter . taken together these results strongly suggest that sweet monomers are not capable of forming sugar translocating pores on their own but require oligomerization for transport activity .
