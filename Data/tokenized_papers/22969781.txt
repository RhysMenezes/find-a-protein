plant myosins xi were implicated in cell growth f actin organization and organelle transport with myosin xi k being a critical contributor to each of these processes . however subcellular localization of myosins and the identity of their principal cargoes remain poorly understood . here we generated a functionally competent _METHOD_ protein tagged myosin xi k and investigated its spatial distribution within arabidopsis cells . this myosin was found to associate primarily not with larger organelles _LOCATION_ as was broadly assumed but with endomembrane vesicles trafficking along f actin . subcellular localization and fractionation experiments indicated that the nature of myosin associated vesicles is organ and cell type specific . in leaves a large proportion of these vesicles aligned and co fractionated with a motile _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ subdomain . in roots non _LOCATION_ vesicles were a dominant myosin cargo . myosin xi k showed a striking _PROTEIN_ localization at the tips of growing but not mature root hairs . these results strongly suggest that a major mechanism whereby myosins contribute to plant cell physiology is vesicle transport and that this activity can be regulated depending on the growth phase of a cell .
arabidopsis myosin xi k is encoded by a large gene transcript that undergoes alternative splicing _PROTEIN_ . to ensure proper gene _PROTEIN_ and regulation we placed a _METHOD_ tag at the end of the coding sequence in a genomic xi k clone to produce xi k _METHOD_ . although xi k is the most significant contributor to myosin dependent cell growth and organelle transport two paralogous myosins xi and xi have partially redundant functions in these processes _PROTEIN_ . therefore to determine if xi k _METHOD_ is functionally competent we transformed the modified genomic clone into xi k xi xi triple knockout plants . the plants exhibit reduced size and possess much shorter root hairs compared to the wild type _PROTEIN_ . immunoblot analyses confirmed _PROTEIN_ of the kda xi k _METHOD_ product in the transformed xi k xi xi xi k _METHOD_ plants . the _PROTEIN_ level of xi k _METHOD_ was not significantly different from that of the wild type xi k in the columbia control . phenotypic characterization of these plants showed that their mean rosette diameter and height were significantly higher than those of plants . furthermore the rosette diameter of these plants was not significantly distinct from that of the columbia control plants . although marginally significant the height of transgenic plants was only lower than that of columbia compared to reduction seen in plants . these results are in agreement with accessory roles for myosins xi and xi in plant growth which cause no defects when inactivated on their own _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . characterization of root hairs also confirmed the functional competence of xi k _METHOD_ . myosins xi k and xi provide similar additive contributions to root hair elongation inactivation of either gene results in approximately threefold root hair length reduction _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . accordingly _PROTEIN_ of xi k _METHOD_ resulted in a approximately threefold increase in the root hair length compared to that of plants similar to the length of the xi root hairs . we concluded that the ability of xi k _METHOD_ to rescue the plant and root hair growth defects in the mutant validated the functional activity of this myosin . for brevity the xi k xi xi xi k _METHOD_ plant line was dubbed r for rescued . the elongated epidermal cells of arabidopsis leaf midrib are a favored model for myosin research due to their imaging accessibility and extensive myosin dependent trafficking of organelles . observation of these cells in the plants using confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed a striking pattern of xi k _METHOD_ distribution most of the _METHOD_ was associated with motile vesicle like bodies moving along linear tracks . the remaining _METHOD_ material appeared in scattered patches . this distribution pattern suggested that most of the myosin xi k _METHOD_ pool is associated with endomembrane vesicles whereas a relatively small fraction of myosin was present elsewhere in _LOCATION_ . confocal images of the leaf midvein epidermal cells in plants _PROTEIN_ xi k _METHOD_ and different compartment specific markers . in contrast to _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ gus xi k _METHOD_ is associated with vesicle like bodies shown in the boxed close up inset . co localization of xi k _METHOD_ and f actin marker lifeact mturquoise . co localization of xi k _METHOD_ and _LOCATION_ marker nag mturquoise . co localization of xi k _METHOD_ and the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ marker in the leaf and root epidermis . co localization of xi k _METHOD_ and secretory vesicle marker _PROTEIN_ mturquoise . to determine if xi k _METHOD_ co localizes with f actin the plants were transformed to _PROTEIN_ microfilament marker lifeact mturquoise _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . xi k _METHOD_ and lifeact mturquoise were largely co localized with a relatively high mean pearson co localization coefficient of as well as a high degree of mutual overlap between the pools of xi k _METHOD_ and lifeact mturquoise . an analogous co localization analysis of xi k _METHOD_ and the _LOCATION_ marker nag mturquoise showed that only a small fraction of the myosin pool was associated with _LOCATION_ stacks . furthermore the fraction of xi k _METHOD_ overlapping _LOCATION_ was only as defined by manders coefficient . these data indicate that _LOCATION_ stacks are not the primary cargo of myosin xi k. it should also be emphasized that as seen in the merged image the vesicle like bodies tagged with xi k _METHOD_ are smaller and much more numerous compared to nag mturquoise tagged _LOCATION_ stacks . analysis of xi k _METHOD_ co localization with the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ marker _PROTEIN_ revealed a dramatically different picture of an extensive overlap . interestingly although most of the myosin xi k _METHOD_ co localized with _LOCATION_ a smaller fraction of _LOCATION_ overlapped with myosin . this distribution pattern suggested that only a motile subdomain of _LOCATION_ was associated with myosin whereas most of _LOCATION_ is myosin free . it should be pointed out however that the organization of the myosin xi k _METHOD_ decorated material was distinct from that of _LOCATION_ even in areas of maximal overlap . whereas the myosin associated particles had a beads on a string appearance _LOCATION_ exhibited a characteristic network of more flat cisternae . this difference was even more pronounced in root epidermal cells . in these cells a large fraction of _LOCATION_ was contained in spindle shaped _LOCATION_ bodies interconnected by thin strands . as clearly seen in figure e the bright _LOCATION_ bodies scarcely if at all overlapped with myosin associated material that again appeared as beads . these data suggest that only a fraction of the _LOCATION_ is interacting with myosin . one possibility is that this fraction is composed of motile _LOCATION_ derived vesicles . to further explore the nature of the myosin associated material we investigated xi k _METHOD_ co localization with vesicles labeled by the secretory carrier _LOCATION_ protein _PROTEIN_ a marker of post _LOCATION_ vesicle clusters observable by confocal microscopy . to this end we generated a _PROTEIN_ marker fused with mturquoise _PROTEIN_ . our analysis showed a substantial level of co localization but relatively little overlap of xi k _METHOD_ with _PROTEIN_ mturquoise indicating that _PROTEIN_ labeled vesicles represent only a fraction of the myosin xi k cargoes in this cell type . it should be accentuated that the _PROTEIN_ specific secretory vesicle clusters were comparable in size and appearance to myosin xi k _METHOD_ tagged vesicular bodies . previous research demonstrated the myosin xi dependent nature of the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ transport _PROTEIN_ . in contrast the first experimental indication of the direct myosin xi involvement in the transport of secretory vesicles was provided only recently _PROTEIN_ . to determine if the limited co localization of xi k _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ containing vesicles is functionally relevant we compared _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ motility in columbia and plants . as seen in movies and in supplementary material myosin inactivation resulted in dramatic reduction of the long distance movement of marker tagged vesicles indicating that their transport is myosin dependent . taken together these co localization and genetic analyses strongly suggested that endomembrane vesicles rather than larger organelles such as _LOCATION_ are the principal myosin cargoes . because the average diameter of the typical individual vesicles is below the resolution of a light microscope we assume that the myosin or _PROTEIN_ labeled structures seen in figure are vesicle clusters in accord with a common agreement in this filed . furthermore the average size and pattern of the myosin xi k _METHOD_ associated vesicular clusters are dramatically distinct from those of the larger organelles such as _LOCATION_ mitochondria or _LOCATION_ . these organelles do not exhibit a beads on a string appearance characteristic of motile myosin containing vesicular clusters . at these roughly isometric clusters are much smaller than e.g. typical elongated mitochondria present in arabidopsis leaf cells . it looks likely that the myosin transport competent vesicles include _LOCATION_ derived secretory and possibly other vesicle types . a striking pattern of myosin xi k _METHOD_ localization was revealed in root hairs which grow via a _PROTEIN_ elongation mechanism . a much higher level of this myosin was present in the growing root hairs compared to the cell base from which the root hairs extend . within the elongating hairs xi k _METHOD_ was dramatically enriched in the tip area whereas outside the tips xi k _METHOD_ was associated with vesicles moving along f actin bundles . it should be emphasized that the xi k _METHOD_ labeled structures in the tip showed highly dynamic behavior suggestive of extensive vesicular trafficking . this behavior is illustrated by the rapid frap of myosin xi k _METHOD_ in root hair tips which indicates that the myosin pool in the tip is constantly renewing rather than forming a resident population . in contrast there was no preferential myosin accumulation at the tips of the mature root hairs . the myosin labeled structures in these cells exhibited a relatively steady flow throughout the cell . confocal imaging analysis of xi k _METHOD_ and vesicle specific _METHOD_ tagged markers in growing and mature root hairs . localization patterns of _METHOD_ gus control xi k _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ are shown . arrows in mark similar root hairs showing myosin xi k _METHOD_ accumulation in the cell tip not observed in . _METHOD_ recovery after photobleaching analysis of the growing root hair tips _PROTEIN_ xi k _METHOD_ . frap analysis of growing root hairs in columbia and plants stably transformed to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . identical photobleaching settings were used for all trials . dashed circles in indicate the photobleached areas in frap experiments shown in . the observed growth stage dependent myosin localization in root hairs was very similar to that of the secretory vesicle markers _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which accumulated at the tips of growing but not mature root hairs . the role of the myosins in vesicular trafficking was further addressed using plants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ reporter . inactivation of the three myosins results in a substantial reduction in the dynamics of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labeled vesicles . instead of the rapid processive transport seen in the control these vesicles showed slow zigzag like movement in the root hairs . this effect was validated by frap analysis which demonstrated slower _METHOD_ recovery in the mutant compared to control plants . collectively these data suggest that myosin xi k is involved in long distance transport of vesicles along f actin bundles and possibly in short distance delivery to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of vesicles _METHOD_ at the tip of a growing root hair . in addition the pattern and dynamics of myosin xi k localization in root hairs shows striking similarity to those reveled in moss protonemal cells that also grow via _PROTEIN_ elongation . to address the physical association of myosin xi k with endomembranes supported by imaging we used leaf extract fractionation and an xi k specific antibody _PROTEIN_ . clarified leaf extracts from columbia plants were centrifuged to separate the soluble _LOCATION_ fraction and the microsomal fraction . as seen in figure a virtually all of the myosin was present in the microsomal pellet . in contrast when the extract was treated with the triton x to solubilize the _LOCATION_ of the myosin was found in the supernatant . this result is fully compatible with endomembranes being the major myosin xi k cargo . cell fractionation analysis of the distribution of myosin xi k and subcellular compartment markers using immunoblotting . analysis of the arabidopsis leaf extracts shows presence of the myosin xi k in the microsomal pellet treatment by triton x results in xi k release to detergent soluble supernatant . arrows show protein marker positions and their mol . _METHOD_ in kda . fractionation of the leaf extracts in the sucrose gradients . immunoblot analyses of the gradient fractions using xi k or cell compartment specific antibodies as indicated at the left . g _LOCATION_ tg trans _LOCATION_ pvc pre _LOCATION_ compartment pm _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . quantification of the protein band intensity for the immunoblot analyses shown in . fractionation of the root extracts in the sucrose gradients similar to the analysis shown in . exo exocyst components other designations are as in . to address the nature of the endomembranes bound by myosin xi k the extracts were fractionated in an isopycnic sucrose gradient and individual fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting using antibody markers specific for distinct endomembrane compartments . in these fractions the xi k peak was well separated from those of the _PROTEIN_ and h _PROTEIN_ markers for pvc and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ respectively . on the other hand the myosin peak corresponded well to the peaks of the _LOCATION_ marker bip and _LOCATION_ markers and nag . the distribution of the trans _LOCATION_ vesicle marker _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ also corresponded broadly to that of the myosin . these results suggested that most of the myosin xi k in leaf cells is associated with the _LOCATION_ organelle and secretory vesicles derived _LOCATION_ . we also investigated the myosin fractionation pattern in extracts from columbia roots . interestingly with root as the source myosin xi k clearly separated not only from the pvc and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but also from the _LOCATION_ . the best correspondence was observed between the myosin peak and that of exocyst protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ likely to be associated with secretory vesicles . the myosin peak was also coincident with one of the peaks for the vesicular marker _PROTEIN_ . we concluded that in the root cells most of the myosin xi k is bound not to the _LOCATION_ but rather to the secretory vesicles . thus fractionation results have validated myosin association with endomembranes and were consistent with imaging results suggesting vesicular cargo . the fractionation patterns of myosin and endomembrane compartment specific markers indicated that major myosin cargoes could vary between two different tissues .
a genomic copy of the myosin xi k gene _PROTEIN_ tagged by insertion of the _METHOD_ orf _METHOD_ was generated as described for the _PROTEIN_ tagged xi k _PROTEIN_ . the _METHOD_ orf was pcr amplified and inserted in a binary vector carrying a genomic copy of the xi k using overlapping pcr . the resulting plasmid was mobilized into agrobacterium tumefaciens and used to transform the xi k xi xi plants _PROTEIN_ by floral dipping . the identifiers for the t dna insertion lines used to generate plants were and respectively . transgenic plants designated were selected using hygromycin containing medium and _METHOD_ imaging . immunoblotting using a rabbit polyclonal xi k antibody rabbit polyclonal antibody to _LOCATION_ binding protein or mouse monoclonal _METHOD_ antibody was done as described _PROTEIN_ . all four originally selected independent lines of transformed plants showed very similar levels of xi k _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and virtually indistinguishable phenotypes . one of these lines was selected for all following analyses . to compare the _PROTEIN_ levels of myosin xi k in columbia to that of xi k _METHOD_ in line plants the immunoblots were quantified by measuring mean band intensity normalized to that of a loading control . the phenotypes of plant lines presented in figures d f were characterized as described _PROTEIN_ statistical analyses of the data including standard deviations shown as _LOCATION_ bars and t tests were done using microsoft excel package . the p values corresponding to pairwise comparisons of data sets are presented in the text under results . to generate transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ compartment specific markers a binary vector was modified to accommodate an _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ and a polyadenylation signal and used to generate n terminal fusions of the mturquoise _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ with the actin binding domain lifeact _PROTEIN_ the transmembrane domain of n acetylglucosaminyl transferase i _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . an _LOCATION_ targeted _METHOD_ was described before _PROTEIN_ . the marker _PROTEIN_ plants were selected using glufosinate . the transgenic plant lines generated in columbia or genetic background had normal developmental phenotypes under optimal growth conditions . this was also the case for the lifeact mturquoise plants in accord with recent independent work . the microscopy was done using a zeiss lsm microscope and a na objective . plants _PROTEIN_ myosin xi k _METHOD_ and mturquoise or _METHOD_ tagged markers were grown on vertical plates and used for imaging the lower midrib epidermal cells or root hairs . for _METHOD_ the argon laser was used with a nm dichroic beam splitter and a nm bandpass filter . to reliably avoid bleed through of the yellow and blue fluorophore signals dual imaging of _METHOD_ and mturquoise _METHOD_ was done using the single track and a nm diode laser at transmission power and argon laser at transmission power respectively . we also used a hft nm beam splitter and a nm bandpass filter for mturquoise and a nm bandpass filter for _METHOD_ . to reconfirm that no bleed through has occurred a series of control scans for each sample was carried out . in these scans either of two lasers was turned off during the scan . the disappearance of the signal in the corresponding channel while the image in the alternative channel remained visible proved that the bleed through between channels was below the detectable level . co localization studies were done using the jacop plugin for imagej software . prior to performing calculations background correction was done using a set of built in tools available in the imagej . first merged color dual channel images were separated into individual channels using the color split feature and median filter was applied to each channel independently . then the background subtraction was done to remove residual background by using the rolling ball tool . threshold within the jacop plugin was set by using automatically calculated values suggested by the program to avoid user bias . both pearson s coefficient and manders coefficients and were calculated and compared . each coefficient shown in table in supplementary material represents a mean and standard deviation for images derived from five plants . the pearson s coefficient is commonly used to determine extent of overlap between image pairs via analyzing similarity between shapes while ignoring the signal intensities . a value of represents perfect correlation and a value represents no correlation _PROTEIN_ . the manders and coefficients are the percentage of pixels in one channel that overlaps with the signal in other channel . for the _METHOD_ recovery after photobleaching analysis of plants _PROTEIN_ myosin xi k _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ all argon laser lines and diode nm laser line were used simultaneously at transmittance for iterations at maximum scanning speed . the bleaching routine started with two pre bleach scans followed by the bleaching scan . after bleaching images were taken at the argon laser transmission for s. _METHOD_ recovery was measured using the lsm software . _METHOD_ intensities in the unbleached regions were measured to ensure that no substantial _METHOD_ reduction occurred during the observation period . the frap measurements for each experimental variant were done using distinct root hairs mean and standard deviation values were calculated for each time point as shown in figures h i . _LOCATION_ association assays were done using young columbia leaves . the g supernatant was prepared and equal fractions were supplemented with either homogenization buffer or triton x . aliquots were centrifuged at g and the resulting pellets were adjusted to the same volume as supernatants and analyzed by immunoblotting . _LOCATION_ fractionation of leaf tissue was done essentially as described by zhang et al . root fractionation as described by preuss et al . _PROTEIN_ . fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting using the following antisera to known organelle markers rabbit polyclonal to _LOCATION_ bip rabbit polyclonal to _LOCATION_ marker mouse monoclonal anti _METHOD_ antibody to detect nag _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ rabbit polyclonal to _PROTEIN_ rabbit polyclonal to pre _LOCATION_ compartment marker _PROTEIN_ rabbit polyclonal to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker h _PROTEIN_ and mouse polyclonal antibodies to the exocyst subunit _PROTEIN_ . the fractionation experiments were repeated at least three times for leaf and root extracts each producing consistent fractionation profiles represented in figure .
