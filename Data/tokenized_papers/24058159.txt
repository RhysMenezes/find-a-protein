histone deacetylation regulates gene _PROTEIN_ during plant stress responses and is therefore an interesting target for epigenetic manipulation of stress sensitivity in plants . unfortunately overexpression of the core enzymes has either been ineffective or has caused pleiotropic morphological abnormalities . in yeast and mammals hdacs operate within multiprotein complexes . searching for putative components of plant hdac complexes we identified a gene with partial homology to a functionally uncharacterized member of the yeast complex which we called histone deacetylation _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is encoded by a single copy gene in the genomes of model plants and crops and therefore presents an attractive target for biotechnology . here we present a functional characterization of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis thaliana . we show that _PROTEIN_ is a ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ protein that interacts with at least two deacetylases _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ promotes histone deacetylation and attenuates derepression of genes under water stress . the fast growing _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants outperformed wild type plants not only on well watered soil but also when water supply was reduced . our findings identify _PROTEIN_ as a rate limiting component of the histone deacetylation machinery and as an attractive tool for increasing germination rate and _METHOD_ production of plants .
_PROTEIN_ is a single copy gene in arabidopsis . predicted splice variants only differ in the upstream untranslated region . unique _PROTEIN_ homologs are also present in all other plant species for which genome information is currently available including important crops such as maize and rice . the amino acid long sequence of the predicted plant _PROTEIN_ proteins contains an amino acid long sequence in the c terminal half that is highly similar to proteins which are ubiquitously present in fungi algae and protozoa but remain functionally uncharacterized . particularly high sequence similarity occurs in a protein domain family signature labeled as histone deacetylation . the term derives from biochemical evidence that yeast coelutes with the large complex but the region has no homology to catalytic domains of hdacs . based on sequence similarity no obvious function can be assigned to this or any other part of the _PROTEIN_ sequence . the more variable extended n terminal part of _PROTEIN_ has no counterpart in non plant genomes . sequence extension from to _PROTEIN_ occurred between algae and land plants with mosses showing intermediate length . the notion of a conserved nonredundant function of _PROTEIN_ is supported by ubiquitous _PROTEIN_ within the plant . histochemical analysis of stable arabidopsis lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter revealed _PROTEIN_ promoter activity in all vegetative tissues including seed root cotyledon rosette leaf and flower bud . however gus was not detected inside anthers and stigmas indicating that _PROTEIN_ is silenced during reproduction . this is in accordance with a general resetting of chromatin status during reproduction . visualization of a green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein in transiently _PROTEIN_ tobacco plants and in stable transgenic arabidopsis plants showed exclusive presence of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ but not in the nucleolus . to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ is a member of hdac protein complexes in plants we tested colocalization and direct interaction of _PROTEIN_ with known hdacs of arabidopsis . coexpression of full length _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in epidermal tobacco cells indicated tight colocalization of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in different locations within the _LOCATION_ . direct interaction was investigated by bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation . to avoid misinterpretation of background _METHOD_ we used a new ratiometric bifc assay in which n and c terminal halves of yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fused to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively and a full length _METHOD_ are _PROTEIN_ from a single vector . in _METHOD_ producing cells a strong _METHOD_ signal was recorded for _PROTEIN_ and for _PROTEIN_ indicating successful bifc and hence interaction of _PROTEIN_ with both hdacs . bifc was also successful when _PROTEIN_ was coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ previously shown to interact with _PROTEIN_ in yeast two hybrid assays . by contrast no _METHOD_ signal was recorded for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ does not interact with all hdac complex proteins . normalization of the obtained _METHOD_ signal to the _METHOD_ signal from the same cell provided statistically significant quantitative evidence for a strong and specific interaction of _PROTEIN_ with the two deacetylases in the heterologous system . in vitro pull down experiments using glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ and his tagged recombinant proteins further confirmed the ability of _PROTEIN_ to physically interact with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . using _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as bait _PROTEIN_ was pulled down in _LOCATION_ enriched protein samples obtained from leaves of mature arabidopsis plants . a single band for _PROTEIN_ was detected in these assays indicating that additional modified or truncated _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ in the in vitro system were not produced in planta . _PROTEIN_ was not recovered in pull down assays with _PROTEIN_ alone . no _PROTEIN_ was detected when the same assays were performed with protein extract from a t dna insertion knockout line _PROTEIN_ . to test whether _PROTEIN_ had an influence on histone deacetylation activity in the plant we probed leaf protein extracts from wild type and mutant lines with a commercial antibody that recognizes acetylated lys residues and in histone a predominant target of _PROTEIN_ . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ knockout plants produced a significantly higher signal ratio than wild type plants indicating higher levels of the acetylated form of over the deacetylated form . _PROTEIN_ of the genomic sequence of _PROTEIN_ under its own promoter in the _PROTEIN_ background _PROTEIN_ reverted this phenotype in the complementation line was similar to the wild type . we conclude that _PROTEIN_ interacts with hdacs and is required for hdac activity in planta . to investigate physiological functions of _PROTEIN_ we generated several homozygous lines from currently available arabidopsis lines with t dna insertions in _PROTEIN_ coding sequence or untranslated regions . only one of these _PROTEIN_ derived from gabi kat with a t dna insertion in the first intron proved to be a true knockout of _PROTEIN_ at the transcript and protein level . _PROTEIN_ transcript levels in the other t dna insertion lines were similar to those in the wild type or even higher . some partial mrna but no _PROTEIN_ protein was detected in _PROTEIN_ plants . _PROTEIN_ complementation lines were obtained by _PROTEIN_ genomic _PROTEIN_ under its own promoter in _PROTEIN_ background . we also produced stable homozygous _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines in col background using either or ubiquitin promoter _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . both lines produced fold higher _PROTEIN_ mrna levels than the col wild type . it was previously reported that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant lines are hypersensitive to aba during germination . germinating seeds arrest growth and development if they encounter low water potentials in the environment . the postimbibition response is mediated by aba and can be mimicked by external application of aba . gibberellin antagonizes aba in this response and hence seedling growth arrest also occurs if the ga biosynthesis inhibitor paclobutrazol _PROTEIN_ is applied . to test a function of _PROTEIN_ in this process seeds of arabidopsis wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ ox lines were imbibed to break dormancy and subsequently plated out on agar plates containing different concentrations of sodium chloride mannitol aba or _PROTEIN_ . a cumulative germination rate was scored as the number of seedlings that had developed cotyledons after d. in control conditions all lines germinated similarly well and germinated seedlings were similar in size and shape . all lines showed a _PROTEIN_ in germination rates with increasing concentrations of nacl mannitol aba or _PROTEIN_ however compared with the wild type _PROTEIN_ was significantly more sensitive whereas the ox lines were significantly less sensitive to the treatments . hyposensitivity was observed in both ox lines independent of promoter or insertion site . homozygous lines derived from and displayed similar or slightly _PROTEIN_ aba sensitivity during germination in accordance with a moderate increase of _PROTEIN_ mrna in these lines . we conclude that the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ quantitatively determines the set point of aba sensitivity in germinating seeds . the _PROTEIN_ that _PROTEIN_ overexpression had a desensitizing effect on aba dependent germination was interesting because _PROTEIN_ overexpression had not been proven to produce physiological phenotypes . we therefore assessed aba sensitivity in seedlings of an _PROTEIN_ overexpressing line previously generated for biochemical studies . _PROTEIN_ seedlings showed similar aba sensitivity as wild type plants and they were considerably more sensitive to aba than _PROTEIN_ ox seedlings despite a similar increase in transcript level . to test whether histone deacetylation was required for aba dependence of seed germination and for the effect of _PROTEIN_ on this process we subjected germinating seeds to the hdac inhibitor trichostatin a _PROTEIN_ . unlike higher _PROTEIN_ concentrations tested before the low micromolar concentrations of _PROTEIN_ applied in our experiments had no effect on seed germination in the absence of aba . nevertheless _PROTEIN_ increased the aba sensitivity of wild type plants in a dose dependent manner with producing a significant effect at aba and _PROTEIN_ producing a significant effect at aba . furthermore addition of _PROTEIN_ increased aba sensitivity of the _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines . thus aba sensitivity of germinating seeds and desensitization of seedlings toward aba by _PROTEIN_ overexpression depend on the catalytic activity of hdacs . several developmental phenotypes have been reported for hdac mutants . for example _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants display embryonic structures on mature leaves and do not repress embryo specific transcription _PROTEIN_ such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and aba _PROTEIN_ after germination . by contrast leaves of _PROTEIN_ plants were normal and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were effectively repressed already d after germination . _PROTEIN_ transcript was still present at dag with _PROTEIN_ plants _PROTEIN_ higher levels and _PROTEIN_ ox plants _PROTEIN_ lower levels than wild type plants but was reduced to very low levels in all lines by dag . we conclude that in control conditions _PROTEIN_ is not required for successful progression of seedlings into the vegetative growth phase . during vegetative growth leaf development was normal in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ ox plants . new leaves appeared at a similar rate in all lines . when grown in long day conditions wild type and _PROTEIN_ ox plants started to bolt within weeks whereas _PROTEIN_ plants continued to produce rosette leaves and flowered weeks _PROTEIN_ at considerably higher rosette leaf number . the flowering phenotype was reflected in a high transcript level of the flowering inhibitor _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ knockout plants on day compared with low levels in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ ox plants . it can be concluded that _PROTEIN_ does not affect vegetative development but is required for the transition to the reproductive stage . despite normal vegetative development _PROTEIN_ mutant lines showed a clear growth phenotype . differences in root length and leaf size started to appear within weeks after germination and led to significant differences of shoot and root weights in older plants particularly when the vegetative growth phase was extended by applying short day conditions . with a similar number of leaves week old _PROTEIN_ ox plants had produced more and _PROTEIN_ plants had produced less fresh weight than wild type plants and the differences increased to after weeks . all lines had a similar relative water content of hence differences in fresh weight were primarily caused by differences in dry matter . both _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines showed enhanced growth with _PROTEIN_ being consistently slightly bigger than plants . a positive correlation between _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ level and growth was further confirmed in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complementation lines . plant sizes and weights reflected the _PROTEIN_ protein levels in the lines . arabidopsis hdac mutants have not been shown to have obvious growth phenotypes . we therefore reassessed growth of _PROTEIN_ knockdown _PROTEIN_ plants in our growth conditions . indeed _PROTEIN_ plants produced less fresh and dry weight than the corresponding wild type plants despite slightly higher leaf number . by contrast _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants had similar weights as wild type plants and therefore did not phenocopy _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines . to examine a function of _PROTEIN_ in transcriptional regulation we treated week old hydroponically grown wild type and mutant plants with mm nacl for h and determined transcript levels of several known salt stress responsive genes including aba biosynthesis genes aba _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and aba _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ resistant to _PROTEIN_ dehydrin responsive to _PROTEIN_ and abi five binding _METHOD_ . we found that after the salt treatment transcript levels showed a consistent profile across the lines with higher levels in _PROTEIN_ and/or lower levels in _PROTEIN_ ox plants than in wild type plants . in control conditions transcript levels of the genes were similarly low in all lines apart from _PROTEIN_ transcript which was increased in _PROTEIN_ . analysis of shoot aba levels confirmed that aba biosynthesis was efficiently induced by salt in all lines but attained levels were slightly higher/lower in _PROTEIN_ lines . aba receptor _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and drought repressed protein protease like drought _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are examples of genes that are downregulated by osmotic stress . we found that both genes were efficiently repressed by salt stress in all lines but in control conditions _PROTEIN_ and hdc ox plants produced higher and lower transcript levels than the wild type respectively . to assess whether and which of the observed transcriptional changes were a consequence of altered histone acetylation status we performed anti chromatin immunoprecipitation _PROTEIN_ quantitative pcr on regions encompassing the start codons of the above genes . for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we recovered less _PROTEIN_ dna from _PROTEIN_ ox plants and more from _PROTEIN_ dna _PROTEIN_ plants than from wild type plants . by contrast no change was found for _PROTEIN_ suggesting that the transcriptional changes in this gene are the result of positive feedback regulation through aba . the acetylation status of other genes remains to be tested . the results obtained here identify _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as potentially direct targets of _PROTEIN_ facilitated histone deacetylation and they provide a mechanistic explanation for the altered transcriptional responses of these genes in the mutants . the combination of enhanced growth with lower _PROTEIN_ of stress inducible genes in _PROTEIN_ ox lines raised our curiosity about the net outcome of these potentially counterproductive features on plant performance under water or salt stress . we therefore subjected _PROTEIN_ mutant lines and wild type plants to a controlled water limiting regime in short day conditions that started on day and imposed a continuous relative soil water content of of the control condition for the remainder of the experiment . differences in growth between the lines were apparent in larger _PROTEIN_ and smaller _PROTEIN_ rosette diameters of younger plants recorded on days and . in older plants rosette diameters differed less due to maximal extension of the outer leaves but significant differences of total shoot fresh and dry weights were found when the plants were harvested on day . in well watered conditions shoot fresh weights were higher in _PROTEIN_ ox plants and lower in _PROTEIN_ plants than in wild type plants . limited water supply slowed the growth of all lines yet _PROTEIN_ ox plants still produced significantly higher _METHOD_ than wild type plants and _PROTEIN_ knockout plants were still significantly smaller than wild type plants . in a second experiment hydroponically grown plants were subjected for d to salt stress . addition of mm nacl is a physiologically relevant sublethal salt stress dose for moderately salt tolerant plants such as arabidopsis and did not cause severe chlorosis or desiccation over the course of this experiment . however the treatment reduced shoot water content and slowed growth in all lines . importantly salt stressed _PROTEIN_ ox continued to produce significantly more root and shoot _METHOD_ than the wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants remained smaller . thus under moderate salt stress the growth advantage of _PROTEIN_ overexpression is _PROTEIN_ despite lower responsiveness of salt inducible genes .
