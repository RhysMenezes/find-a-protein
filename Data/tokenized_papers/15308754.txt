functional genomic technologies are generating vast amounts of data describing the presence of transcripts or proteins in plant cells . together with classical genetics these approaches broaden our understanding of the gene products required for specific responses . looking to the future the focus of research must shift to the dynamic aspects of biology molecular _METHOD_ of function and regulation . phosphorylation is a key regulatory _PROTEIN_ in all aspects of plant biology but it is difficult if not impossible for most researchers to identify in vivo phosphorylation sites within their proteins of interest . we have developed a large scale strategy for the isolation of phosphopeptides and identification by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . here we describe the identification of more than phosphorylation sites from arabidopsis thaliana _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins . these data will be a valuable resource for many fields of plant biology and overcome a major impediment to the elucidation of signal transduction pathways . we present an analysis of the characteristics of phosphorylation sites their conservation among orthologs and paralogs and the existence of putative motifs surrounding the sites . these analyses yield general principles for predicting other phosphorylation sites in plants and provide indications of specificity determinants for responsible kinases . in addition more than sites were mapped on receptor like kinases and revealed an unexpected complexity of regulation . finally the data also provide empirical evidence on the topology of transmembrane proteins . this information indicates that prediction _METHOD_ incorrectly identified the _LOCATION_ portion of the protein in of the transmembrane proteins found in this study . all data are deposited in a new searchable database for plant phosphorylation sites _PROTEIN_ by plantsp that will be updated as the project expands to encompass additional tissues and organelles .
two benchmark parameters were used to test whether the methodology delivers comprehensive proteome coverage the representation of proteins with multiple transmembrane spanning domains and the sequence coverage of cytoplasmic domains that can be phosphorylated . analyzing the data from this large scale phosphoproteomic study we found that approximately two thirds of the identified phosphoproteins had at least one transmembrane domain . one of them a calpain like protein contained a predicted tm domains . it has been suggested that precleavage of _LOCATION_ proteins with cyanogen bromide is necessary for complete tryptic digestion . in an analysis of a total _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ digest however we found very good coverage of even short cytoplasmic loops for the proton _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we postulate that _LOCATION_ shaving of tryptic peptides is facilitated by the _PROTEIN_ that tm domains are often anchored in the _LOCATION_ by polybasic residues on the _LOCATION_ face . thus the accessibility of pm proteins to trypsin does not appear to be a limiting _PROTEIN_ . moreover all fragments were from regions predicted to reside on the cytoplasmic face of the pm indicating that this type of analysis provides information on the topography of proteins within the _LOCATION_ . the functional categories of the identified phosphoproteins show a high representation of proteins with a role in signal transduction . receptor like kinases represent a quarter of all phosphoproteins and all signaling related proteins as far as could be annotated by similarity more than a third . proteins with a role in transport and ion homeostasis _PROTEIN_ constitute another large family . although the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were of high purity a small number of proteins were identified as clear contaminants among them several _LOCATION_ proteins such as dna polymerases and putative transcription _PROTEIN_ . unsurprisingly all but a few phosphorylation sites described here are novel . among the few well characterized plant _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ phosphoproteins are the h _PROTEIN_ and the aquaporins . we reported the identification of previously known and novel phosphorylation sites on several _METHOD_ of the h _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in an earlier publication . _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ aquaporins are known to be regulated by posttranslational modification to _PROTEIN_ to rapid changes in the apoplastic water potential . the phosphorylation sites we identified on two _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ have also been detected in another proteomic study . they are equivalent to of soybean and of spinach both of which are phosphorylated in response to increasing water potential probably by a calcium dependent kinase . in several cases phosphorylation of a particular protein was known or predicted but no data on the precise site of modification were published . the na /h antiporter _PROTEIN_ is phosphorylated by the _PROTEIN_ kinase in complex with the calcium sensor protein _PROTEIN_ on unknown site . the site we identified is consistent with both the anticipated motif and the localization on the hydrophilic c terminus and thus may be the authentic site targeted by _PROTEIN_ . for the remainder of the phosphorylation sites however this report represents the first insights into potential posttranslational regulation of these proteins . in addition to the importance in studying individual proteins the data provide the basis of drawing some general predictions and conclusions about protein phosphorylation in plants . proteins are generally composed of catalytic/functional domains surrounded or interspersed by less defined variable regions . we analyzed our data to investigate if there is a trend in the location of phosphorylation sites in relation to the architecture of the protein using protein domain predictions from the smart web site . figure shows the position of phosphorylation sites relative to functional domains for three multidomain protein families represented in our study . in the majority of cases the sites were outside catalytic and known regulatory domains and sequences surrounding the sites were poorly conserved within a gene family . nevertheless such isoform specific regulatory sites can still be clustered in equivalent regions of the protein . in the case of the multiple drug resistance family of abc transporters the poorly conserved linker region between the duplicated _PROTEIN_ domains is a well known target for phosphorylation in yeast and human transporters . three sites in plant abc transporters share an x ps motif suggesting that these sites are phosphorylated by the same or a related kinase . in the case of the cellulose synthase family all but one of the sites are in the unconserved region upstream of the first tm domain whereas one phosphorylation motif in the catalytic domain of _PROTEIN_ is loosely conserved among several other cesa proteins . among the calcium dependent protein kinases we found two sites within the c terminal calmodulin like domains two in the kinase domain and only two in the highly diverse n termini . taking into account the data from receptor like kinases and other families the majority of phosphorylation sites are located outside of defined catalytic/functional domains . an additional outcome of this analysis was that phosphorylation sites in most of the multispanning tm proteins were close to either the n or c terminus . assuming that phosphorylation is exclusively intracellular the identification of a phosphopeptide establishes the corresponding terminus as cytoplasmic . this knowledge is useful for the determination of the inside/outside topology of unknown _LOCATION_ proteins . we found a web based prediction tool in conflict with our empirical data for more than one quarter of proteins with more than one tm domain . thus these data have significance on a structural as well as functional level . related to the question addressed above we also investigate if the amino acid sequence surrounding a phosphorylation site is conserved between members of functional families of proteins . it could be envisaged that sites involved in the direct regulation of enzyme activity might be more likely to occur within conserved regions of a protein family . on the other hand phosphorylation of unique sites would allow isoform specific regulation . in the latter case these sites may still be conserved among true orthologs in related plant species . figure shows an alignment of the n terminal phosphorylation sites of the cellulose synthase _PROTEIN_ with the corresponding sequences of paralogous cesa proteins and putative orthologs the latter found by blast search of est databases . it is striking that whereas the _PROTEIN_ sites are unique among the paralogous cesa proteins highly similar sequences were found in putative orthologs from the est database indicating that isoform specific regulation of this cellulose synthase protein is conserved even in monocots . to get a more representative overview of sequence conservation around phosphorylation sites we did a similar comparison for all putative transporter proteins . putative paralogs were taken from the aramemnon database . putative orthologs were found by blast search of to amino acids surrounding the phosphorylation site against an est database including a few amino acids of sequence that are conserved in the protein family when possible to reduce random low scoring hits . as shown in table the majority of phosphorylation sites are conserved among putative orthologs and to a lesser extent among some members of the same protein family . because of potential _LOCATION_ in est sequence data a negative result can not be taken as evidence for absence of related phosphorylation sites . conversely however the conservation of a putative phosphorylation motif may be taken as additional supporting evidence for the exact phosphorylation site if the _METHOD_ spectrometric data are ambiguous . the _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation site could not be unambiguously assigned to or in the peptide svsfggiynnk but is more highly conserved in other species . thus it is the more likely candidate . in addition careful analysis of aligned sequences may also help to define specificity determinants of the kinase that targets the sequence . in _PROTEIN_ the phe residue in the position is also conserved and may be important in addition to the known basic x x ser motif for the related kinase _PROTEIN_ . conservation of phosphorylation sites in _LOCATION_ transporters in the _PROTEIN_ transporter _PROTEIN_ and most strikingly the calcium dependent protein kinase _PROTEIN_ we found the interesting case of a conserved acidic residue being replaced by a phosphoamino acid in one or two sequences . in _PROTEIN_ the phosphoserine takes the place of an absolutely conserved asp that coordinates the calcium ion in the ef hand . it is tempting to speculate that phosphorylation of this ser residue represents the switching on of a charge dependent function in one isoform where the others are constitutively on . receptor like ser/thr kinases _PROTEIN_ form an extremely diverse protein family in arabidopsis . because the genome sequence has revealed their number to be in the hundreds the question has arisen of how signaling specificity is ensured . even if only a fraction of all _PROTEIN_ genes is _PROTEIN_ at any given time in one cell it is puzzling how unique output signals are generated from receptors with highly similar kinase domains . our experimental data on _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation sites are perhaps the most striking of this study . with identified phosphoproteins this protein family is by far the best represented and accounts for a quarter of all proteins . figure shows a graphic representation of the position of the phosphorylation sites relative to the conserved kinase subdomains . unexpectedly three quarters of the phosphopeptides came from either the juxtamembrane region or the domain c terminal of the kinase core . the jm and c terminal sequences are highly divergent in length and sequence and the identified phosphorylation sites are generally unique for a single _PROTEIN_ . the implications for signaling _METHOD_ are discussed below . only eight phosphopeptides were found in the activation segment or a loop the best characterized domain for kinase activation . several of them cover the same conserved residues and one of them corresponds to one of the very few previously known _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation sites in _PROTEIN_ . most but not all _PROTEIN_ with phosphorylated a loops belong to the group of rd kinases that require this modification for charge neutralization in the active site . outside of the activation segment some more unusual phosphorylation sites were found . several peptides cover an a s a e motif just upstream of domain i which is highly conserved among the lrrk iii and vii families and probably represents a common regulatory site . modification of residues in the unconserved linker regions between the conserved subdomains i/ii ii/iii and ix/x respectively or within domains x/xi have to our knowledge not been reported for any protein kinase . this certainly reflects a bias in hypothesis driven research toward previously known sites but these unusual sites may indeed prove to be unique for plant _PROTEIN_ or even the particular protein itself . although kinases may have additional protein protein docking or interaction domains the enzymatic active site shows specificity toward its substrates based on the linear sequence surrounding the residue to be phosphorylated . we sorted all unambiguously assigned phosphorylation sites according to single residues in the to positions to detect the frequency of residues within specific positions and to look for common motifs . although most residues were evenly distributed across all positions pro was seldom in the position and overrepresented in the . aromatic residues were also found with disproportionate frequency in the position but were virtually excluded from position . taking these analyses further we found restraint on the residues in the position when an aromatic residue was in the position . overall of total gly residues are present in the position . however when an aromatic residue is present in the position gly is the residue of the time . conversely pro or aromatic residues are never present at the position with an aromatic residue in the position . these indications of bias probably reflect spatial restraints of the substrate binding site of the relevant kinases . information from these types of analyses will be useful both for designing peptide libraries to test kinase specificity determinants and for refining _METHOD_ for predicting phosphorylation sites . finally we investigated the possibility of using patterns of residues surrounding the phosphorylation site to predict kinase specificity determinants or to cluster proteins that may be coordinately regulated . we found an unusually large number of motifs with acidic residues in the to positions many even with a ps motif . the second largest group were protein kinase a like motifs ps . the high frequency of these motifs reflects the _PROTEIN_ that acidic or basic directed specificity is common among the well characterized kinases . the g ps aromatic motif discussed above is conserved among most _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and all proteins . interestingly phosphorylation of the homologous site of the aquaporin has been shown to be calcium dependent and uncharacterized calcium dependent activities also phosphorylated a h _PROTEIN_ and the syntaxin _PROTEIN_ . it is conceivable that this unusual phosphorylation motif is subject to regulation by the same or closely related kinases . if these kinases are indeed cdpks the substrate motifs are more variable than anticipated . several motifs have been described as preferred substrates for the related like and calcium dependent protein kinases . many of the experimentally determined sites correspond to the simple pattern basic pser but only very few match the ideal motif determined in peptide based assays . it is possible that the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ samples contain only very few substrates of like kinases such as metabolic enzymes but a more likely explanation is that full length proteins in vivo reveal a more complex recognition motif than a short stretch of primary structure . thus the amino acid positions described here for sorting may not actually be the sole specificity determinant for the respective kinase . it is likely however that the inclusion of structural and other parameters as well as empirical data on kinase specificity will allow us to use these data sets for predictions as was successfully done for mammalian proteins .
