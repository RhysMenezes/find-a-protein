in addition to proton pumping complex i plant mitochondria contain several type ii nad h dehydrogenases in the electron transport chain . the extra enzymes allow the nonenergy conserving electron transfer from cytoplasmic and _PROTEIN_ nad h to ubiquinone . we have investigated the type ii nad h dehydrogenase gene families in arabidopsis . this model plant contains two and four genes closely related to potato genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . a novel homolog termed _PROTEIN_ with a lower but significant similarity to potato _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is also present . all genes are _PROTEIN_ in several organs of the plant . among the nda genes _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ is dependent on light and circadian regulation suggesting separate roles in photosynthesis associated and other respiratory nadh oxidation . genes from all three gene families encode proteins exclusively targeted to mitochondria as revealed by _PROTEIN_ of green _METHOD_ fusion proteins and by western blotting of fractionated cells . phylogenetic analysis indicates that _PROTEIN_ affiliates with cyanobacterial type ii nadh dehydrogenase genes suggesting that this gene entered the eukaryotic cell via the chloroplast progenitor . the _PROTEIN_ should then have been transferred to the _LOCATION_ and acquired a signal for mitochondrial targeting of the protein product . although they are of different origin the nda ndb and ndc genes carry an identical intron position .
database screening of the arabidopsis genome reveals seven _LOCATION_ encoded reading frames with highest similarity to type ii nad h dehydrogenases of e.g . s. cerevisiae and e. coli and potato _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the deduced protein sequences are conserved throughout the complete reading frames including the two conserved nucleotide binding motifs . the arabidopsis homologs group into three families nda ndb and ndc . at _PROTEIN_ and at _PROTEIN_ are both identical at the amino acid level to potato _PROTEIN_ . the at _PROTEIN_ and at _PROTEIN_ show highest sequence identity and to respectively to potato _PROTEIN_ . the unique ef hand motif domain of potato _PROTEIN_ is conserved in all four at ndb homologs . a much lower sequence similarity is seen to the ef hand domain in the n. crassa homolog and a corresponding domain found in plasmodium falciparum and plasmodium yoelli homologs although these domains are located in similar places in the reading frame . the seventh arabidopsis type ii nad h dehydrogenase homolog at _PROTEIN_ shows only approximately amino acid sequence identity to potato _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ demonstrating its separation from the nda and ndb families . in rice two nda type genes and one ndc gene were found . in addition _PROTEIN_ sequence tag clones were found more than identical to st _PROTEIN_ in overlaps of deduced amino acid sequence longer than residues . this indicates that all three gene families are present in dicotyledons and monocotyledons . in general positions of conserved motifs in arabidopsis nda ndb and ndc protein sequences are consistent with those in bacterial yeast and potato nadh dehydrogenase homologs reported previously . apart from this group of seven homologs two putative genes in arabidopsis display some similarity to type ii nad h dehydrogenases . however the reading frames of _GENE_ and _GENE_ are significantly shorter and residues respectively and unlike the other plant homologs do not contain any putative domains for organellar targeting . type ii nad h dehydrogenase genes of arabidopsis the seven identified arabidopsis protein sequences were compared with homologous sequences from bacteria fungi and plants by phylogenetic analysis . distance and maximum parsimony phylogenetic approaches were tested substantially giving identical results . the plant entries group into three distinct subgroups suggesting that there are three families of type ii nad h dehydrogenase genes present in plants . while the nda and ndb sequences of plants are more closely related to the fungal and protist sequences a clustering of at _PROTEIN_ and the rice ndc homolog with cyanobacterial proteins is supported by bootstrap values . this indicates that the ndc genes of plants originate from cyanobacteria and most likely entered the plant cell with the chloroplast progenitor . the two at nda proteins cluster together and like the st _PROTEIN_ they are most closely related to one of the rice homologs . the plant nda family is most similar to a homolog in t. brucei . the n. crassa and the p. falciparum and p. yoelli homologs contain a protein segment corresponding to the plant ndb ef hand domain . however a closer relationship between these homologs is not supported by the phylogenetic tree independent of whether the common domain is included in the analysis or not . the gene structures were compared for the arabidopsis type ii nad h dehydrogenase genes . for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ complete cdna sequences were available in the database . for _PROTEIN_ a partial cdna and two ests were found that determined the location of all splicing sites . however the cdna clone and one est contain residual introns that in each case are spliced in at least one other clone . amplification of the complete reading frame by rt pcr from isolated rna and restriction of the product with hincii and draii generated only cdna fragments consistent with the complete splicing of all introns . all intron positions and most intron lengths are conserved between the two nda genes . within the ndb family most intron positions are conserved . the _PROTEIN_ gene however appears to have lost several introns present in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and shown or predicted present in _PROTEIN_ . one intron position is identical in all three families . this position corresponds to the center of a highly conserved residues protein segment immediately downstream of the ef hand domain of the ndb proteins . all intron positions in the at nda genes and at _PROTEIN_ are conserved in the rice and respectively with one additional intron being present in . the rice only contains two introns corresponding to introns and in the at nda genes . the conservation of gene structures within each gene family provides additional support to the phylogenetic analysis . potato _PROTEIN_ was shown previously to be tightly bound to the internal surface of the inner mitochondrial _LOCATION_ whereas _PROTEIN_ is loosely attached to the external side . similar to potato _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ all arabidopsis homologs contain n terminal domains potentially specifying intracellular targeting . to investigate the cellular localization of the type ii nad h dehydrogenases in arabidopsis mitochondria were purified from leaves by suc gradient centrifugation . the suc gradient efficiently separated mitochondria as evaluated by cytochrome c oxidase activity with a peak in fraction from the heavier chloroplasts where chlorophyll peaked in fraction . catalase a marker for _LOCATION_ had a wide distribution in the gradient with to min ml in fractions to and less than in fractions to . aliquots of the suc gradient were subjected to western blot analyses using antibodies against _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from potato the _PROTEIN_ subunit of wheat complex i and malate dehydrogenase . the distribution of malate dehydrogenase deviated from cytochrome c oxidase and _PROTEIN_ with malate dehydrogenase being virtually absent in fractions and . this indicates that the uppermost part of the cytochrome c oxidase peak contains mitochondria with disrupted inner and outer _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ antibodies specifically detected polypeptides of and kd respectively consistent with the apparent molecular _METHOD_ of st _PROTEIN_ and st _PROTEIN_ . proteins detected with both antibodies have a different distribution as compared with chlorophyll and catalase on the suc gradient . the distribution of the immunodetected nda protein coincided with cytochrome c oxidase activity and the _PROTEIN_ protein . the ndb signal peaked in fraction coinciding with the lower part of the mitochondrial peak . this indicates that the protein is present in intact mitochondria but had been released from less dense mitochondria with disrupted outer _LOCATION_ but retaining malate dehydrogenase i.e . mitoplasts . protein recognized by the ndb antibodies was to a higher extent than malate dehydrogenase found at the top of the gradient where small _LOCATION_ vesicles and soluble proteins are expected suggesting that more ndb protein had been released from the mitochondria . these results indicate that arabidopsis homologs recognized by the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ antibodies are localized in mitochondria and imply an external localization of the immunodetected at ndb proteins similar to potato _PROTEIN_ . to analyze the subcellular localization of individual proteins fusions of potential protein targeting domains with green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ were made for representative genes . segments of cdna encoding the n terminal sequences up to the start of the first conserved nucleotide binding motif were cloned into _METHOD_ in frame with the _METHOD_ . tobacco protoplasts were transiently transformed with the different constructs and _PROTEIN_ of the fusion proteins was analyzed by _METHOD_ microscopy . transformed protoplasts were simultaneously incubated with mitotracker red a mitochondria specific dye . all fusion proteins for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ localized to subcellular structures coinciding with mitotracker red staining and no signal could be detected in chloroplasts . this colocalization suggests that all five analyzed genes encode mitochondrial proteins consistent with the immunological analyses . to get a general overview of whether _PROTEIN_ is constitutive or confined to certain parts of the plants nda ndb and ndc mrna of arabidopsis were analyzed by rt pcr . transcripts for the and kd complex i subunits were used as controls . figure shows agarose gel analyses of rt pcr products . the correct identities of all pcr products were controlled by restriction cleavage . while _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in all organs investigated _PROTEIN_ was preferentially _PROTEIN_ in aboveground tissues with almost no _PROTEIN_ in roots . transcript of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes was present in all parts of the plant whereas _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrnas were almost completely absent in leaves and _PROTEIN_ transcript was also absent in _METHOD_ . the _PROTEIN_ gene was _PROTEIN_ at significant levels in all organs . _PROTEIN_ of complex i subunit genes showed little difference between organs consistent with previous northern blot analyses . the observations for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the complex i controls were also supported by real time rt pcr . the results suggest that all type ii nad h dehydrogenase genes are _PROTEIN_ in several tissues with potential spatial regulation at the transcript level for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . it was found previously that the potato _PROTEIN_ rna level is light dependent and has a daily rhythm with a peak in the morning . the presence of two closely related nda genes in arabidopsis now raises the question whether any of these are light dependent . we put arabidopsis plants that had been grown at h light h dark cycles into constant darkness starting at the end of a light cycle . leaf samples for rna isolation were collected after and h as well as and h after reapplying light and transcript levels determined by real time rt pcr . the _PROTEIN_ transcript increased almost fold after h of darkness an induction that disappeared after and h. upon reexposure to light the transcript was again strongly induced . the _PROTEIN_ transcript was transiently and less than fold elevated in darkness with no increase upon reapplication of light . the transcripts for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ showed a profile similar to the and kd complex i subunits displaying an approximately _PROTEIN_ in response to darkness and a return to original level in response to reapplied light . the _PROTEIN_ pattern shows that the at _PROTEIN_ is specifically controlled by light and may be under circadian regulation similar to the potato _PROTEIN_ . in addition arabidopsis contains a light independent _PROTEIN_ gene .
arabidopsis were grown on soil in climate chambers at using m s light for h d . mitochondria were isolated from g leaves of d old arabidopsis plants using suc gradient separation of mitochondria and chloroplasts . two milliliter fractions were collected from the suc gradient . aliquots of identical volume were analyzed by one dimensional _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose _LOCATION_ . immunostaining was performed with antibodies raised against conserved peptides of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from potato the _PROTEIN_ subunit of wheat complex i and malate dehydrogenase using ecl detection _METHOD_ . cytochrome c oxidase activity and catalase activity was determined by published methods . chlorophyll was determined by acetone extraction . total flower rna isolation and cdna synthesis were carried out similarly as described previously . primers _PROTEIN_ for bamhi restriction were designed to amplify sequences coding for the n terminal domains of each investigated type ii nad h dehydrogenase genes at _PROTEIN_ cgg _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tgg _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tgc ttc tct cg and cgg _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cgg ctt ctc tcc ctc ttt cg at _PROTEIN_ cgg _PROTEIN_ ccg aag aag aag cga tgt tca and cgg _PROTEIN_ ccc cga ccc gag aac cac tac tc at _PROTEIN_ cgg _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ctg aag act ttt cac caa a and cgg _PROTEIN_ cca acc _PROTEIN_ ccc aag cac aac t at _PROTEIN_ cgg _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cga acc aag _PROTEIN_ gaa _PROTEIN_ g and cgg _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ctt ctt ggt tcc _PROTEIN_ ttc aac a and at _PROTEIN_ cgg _PROTEIN_ cca gca _PROTEIN_ gcc _PROTEIN_ ctc tc and cgg _PROTEIN_ cca cac _PROTEIN_ tgg _PROTEIN_ ctt _PROTEIN_ a . amplification was made with the advantage proof reading pcr kit _PROTEIN_ using an initial cycle of s at s at . and s at and then cycles of s at s at and s at . products were cleaved with bamhi and ligated into _METHOD_ upstream of the _METHOD_ reading frame . clones were sequenced for confirmation of the insert using the thermo sequenase primer cycle sequencing kit . approximately protoplasts isolated from tobacco were transiently transformed with of construct dna using a polyethylene glycol method . protoplasts were subsequently incubated with mitotracker red according to the manufacturer 's protocol . _METHOD_ microscopy was performed using an axioplan microscope . axiovision software was used for taking images . _METHOD_ filter sets from ahf analystechnik were for _METHOD_ and chlorophyll _METHOD_ and for mitotracker red . isolation of total rna cdna synthesis and real time pcr were carried out as in svensson et al . except for variations in annealing temperatures . primers were designed so that one primer in each pair spanned an exon border . control amplifications without rt reaction did not detect genomic signals . the primer sequences used were at _PROTEIN_ ctc cgt gag _PROTEIN_ aag gaa gg and ggc gaa _PROTEIN_ gag ggg _PROTEIN_ tg at _PROTEIN_ cga gag caa gga cgc aaa _PROTEIN_ and cag tag gcc gag _PROTEIN_ gag ac at _PROTEIN_ tgc ctg caa ctg ctc _PROTEIN_ tc and _PROTEIN_ gcc cgc cag ttc tga _PROTEIN_ at _PROTEIN_ tac gcc _PROTEIN_ aag caa _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and tgt _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gag _PROTEIN_ tgg _PROTEIN_ at _PROTEIN_ ggt gag tag cca aag acg tg and gaa _PROTEIN_ cgg taa tgc cat gc at _PROTEIN_ cca acg cag _PROTEIN_ cat gga _PROTEIN_ and cac cat _PROTEIN_ cac tct tga gc at _PROTEIN_ caa tgg ccg ttc tct _PROTEIN_ c and aca ccc _PROTEIN_ gcc tct tgt ta aac cga gac aca yga gga ac and tag _PROTEIN_ ctc tcc gac ctc _PROTEIN_ and kd aca _PROTEIN_ tgt _PROTEIN_ cga ttt gc and ttt gag _PROTEIN_ aag _PROTEIN_ cca ac . general molecular biology methods were performed according to sambrook et al . . database searches were _PROTEIN_ performed at the national center of biotechnology information using blastp and tblastn _METHOD_ for the nr and est arabidopsis database sets . pair wise alignments were performed using lalign software .
