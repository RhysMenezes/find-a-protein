the arabidopsis thaliana gene codes for a putative _LOCATION_ phosphoenolpyruvate _PROTEIN_ enolase _PROTEIN_ . the recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein exhibited enolase activity and its kinetic properties were determined . _PROTEIN_ is localized to _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ in most heterotrophic tissues including trichomes and non root hair cells but not in the mesophyll of leaves . two t dna insertion _PROTEIN_ mutants exhibited distorted trichomes and reduced numbers of root hairs as the only visible phenotype . the essential role of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ provision for anabolic processes within _LOCATION_ such as the shikimate pathway is discussed with respect to _LOCATION_ transporters such as the _PROTEIN_ translocator .
the a. thaliana genome contains three genes annotated as putative enos . according to the aramemnon database encodes a protein containing an n terminal transit peptide for _LOCATION_ targeting with a consensus prediction of compared to and for and respectively . for one of the two putative _LOCATION_ eno proteins a dual targeting has been shown recently . a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was located both in the _LOCATION_ and in the _LOCATION_ . the subcellular localization of the putative _LOCATION_ eno _PROTEIN_ and the second _LOCATION_ eno _PROTEIN_ was investigated after fusion of protein fragments to _METHOD_ and transient _PROTEIN_ in a heterotrophic a. thaliana cell culture . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was localized within the _LOCATION_ . as a positive control for _LOCATION_ targeting _METHOD_ was fused to a fragment of the triose phosphate/phosphate translocator _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the same a. thaliana cell culture . in contrast the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was found both in the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and its subcellular localization hence resembles that of . in order to functionally characterize _PROTEIN_ the cdna was fused to a c terminal his tag the construct _PROTEIN_ in e. coli and the _PROTEIN_ protein enriched by ni _PROTEIN_ chromatography . separation of the final preparation by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ revealed three major protein bands with apparent molecular _METHOD_ of kda kda and kda . on western blots only one band corresponding to a m r of kda emerged using an anti his antibody . this band was identical to the protein band after _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with an apparent m r of kda . based on the amino acid sequence of the _PROTEIN_ protein a m r of kda can be calculated which is lower compared to the apparent m r . as estimated densitometerically after _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ approximately of the total protein consisted of _PROTEIN_ . the enriched recombinant _PROTEIN_ preparation after ni _PROTEIN_ chromatography was analyzed for eno activity using a standard assay _PROTEIN_ with either pga or pga as substrates . the specific activity of eno was between and u mg protein . considering that about half of the protein on the gel was in the _PROTEIN_ protein band identified after _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and on western blots the maximum specific activity was calculated to be in the range between to u mg protein . as a control lysates of wild type or transformed e. coli cells before induction of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by iptg were subjected to ni _PROTEIN_ chromatography . no eno activity could be detected in either case . moreover eno activity in crude cell lysates was increased fold and fold upon induction with iptg compared to lysates prepared from un induced and wild type e. coli cells respectively . the specific eno activity was further increased by a _PROTEIN_ of after ni _PROTEIN_ chromatography . for a further kinetic characterization the relative reaction velocity observed for saturating pga concentrations at ph was referred to the highest _PROTEIN_ activity . the ph response curves shown in revealed distinct ph optima for the forward _PROTEIN_ and reverse reaction . for the forward direction there was a sharp ph optimum between ph and ph compared to the reverse reaction which exhibited a broader ph optimum between ph and ph . substrate dependencies of _PROTEIN_ activity in the forward and reverse reaction obeyed michaelis menten kinetics _PROTEIN_ with apparent k m values for the respective substrates in the submillimolar range _PROTEIN_ . at ph the v max of the forward direction was more than doubled compared to the v max of the reverse reaction _PROTEIN_ . in particular the affinity for pga was high at ph with a k m in the upper micromolar range _PROTEIN_ . in general the k m values for both substrates were higher at ph as compared to ph _PROTEIN_ . the kinetic constants determined at ph and ph were used to calculate the equilibrium constants for the eno reaction at both ph values by applying the haldane equation e.g . k eq v max k m _PROTEIN_ v max _PROTEIN_ k m the thermodynamic equilibrium favors the formation of _PROTEIN_ from pga with k eq values of and at ph and ph respectively _PROTEIN_ and is hence close to the reported value of . moreover from the ratios of the apparent k m values for pga and pga the thermodynamic equilibrium for the pgym reaction could be estimated at both ph values _PROTEIN_ . the temporal and spatial _PROTEIN_ profile of _PROTEIN_ was investigated both by semi quantitative rt pcr and promoter reporter gene fusions . the mrna abundance of _PROTEIN_ was high in young roots and young siliques as well as in the shoot apex but low in young leaves _METHOD_ and cotyledons . it was virtually absent from mature leaves and flowers . in order to study the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ at the cellular level transgenic a. thaliana plants were generated carrying three different _PROTEIN_ promoter gus gene fusion constructs _PROTEIN_ . for the promoter construct a there was no gus staining detectable indicating that relevant regulatory cis acting elements were missing in this fragment . as shown in the tissue specific _PROTEIN_ profile with the promotor fusion construct ab matched very well with rt pcr data and in silico _PROTEIN_ profiles based on microarray data _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . in particular mature leaves were free of gus activity and in roots _PROTEIN_ was found only in an early developmental state . moreover the shoot apex and the hypocotyls exhibited substantial gus activity . similar to the rt pcr data cotyledons were devoid of gus activity . apart from the spatial and temporal _PROTEIN_ profiles of different organs interesting insights in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ emerged at the cellular level . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in roots is restricted to the cortex and the central cylinder of the elongation zone . there was no _PROTEIN_ at the root tip or basal parts of the roots . high gus activity was found in trichomes of emerging leaves whereas trichomes of mature leaves were devoid of gus activity . moreover gus activity was also high in the meristematic regions of emerging leaves and the petioles . with the promotor construct c a similar but not identical spatial and temporal _PROTEIN_ profile was obtained as with the construct ab _PROTEIN_ . again mature leaves were free of gus activity _PROTEIN_ and trichomes of young developing leaves exhibited an intense gus staining _PROTEIN_ . in contrast to promoter construct ab promoter construct c also reveals high gus _PROTEIN_ in young and older roots _PROTEIN_ in particular at the root tips and in root hairs _PROTEIN_ . moreover gus _PROTEIN_ was also found in the vasculature of cotyledons _PROTEIN_ which contrasts the lack of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in cotyledons observed in rt pcr experiments . furthermore with promoter construct c there was also some gus staining in the style _PROTEIN_ and in the embryo sac _PROTEIN_ . as predicted from rt pcr data flowers lack _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ completely whereas developing siliques showed a transient increase in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ profile of _PROTEIN_ is consistent with the idea that photosynthetic active chloroplasts lack a complete glycolysis to _PROTEIN_ whereas certain _LOCATION_ of non green tissues in particular those of developing seeds or in roots are capable of generating _PROTEIN_ via glycolysis . in order to test the consequence of a deficiency in _PROTEIN_ two _PROTEIN_ mutant alleles were isolated from the salk t dna insertion mutant collection and established as homozygous lines _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . both mutant alleles lacked _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ completely and total eno activity was reduced by in roots but not in leaves of _PROTEIN_ compared to the wild type . on a macroscopic scale there were no differences in the phenotypes between the wild type and _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . both shoot and root growth was unaffected when plants were grown on _METHOD_ agar . however a closer inspection of trichomes of young leaves revealed differences between mutant and wild type plants . trichomes of the mutants appeared less turgescent and had a distorted phenotype as compared to the wild type . in particular the occurence of a trichome phenotype in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ underlines the _PROTEIN_ pattern observed in _PROTEIN_ promoter gus plants . furthermore there was no significant difference in the root hair lengths between the mutant and the wild type _PROTEIN_ but the number of root hairs was reduced by in week old plants compared to the wild type which might form a link to the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in non root hair cells as has been observed with the _PROTEIN_ promotor gus construct ab .
