the arabidopsis sucrose transporter _PROTEIN_ is highly _PROTEIN_ in pollen however its function has remained unknown . here we show that _PROTEIN_ mutant pollen is defective in vivo as evidenced by segregation distortion and also has low rates of germination in vitro . _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein was localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in pollen tubes . _PROTEIN_ is also _PROTEIN_ in roots and external application of sucrose increased _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in roots . _PROTEIN_ is important for sucrose dependent signaling leading to anthocyanin accumulation in seedlings . _PROTEIN_ mutants accumulated less anthocyanins in response to exogenous sucrose or maltose and microarray analysis revealed reduced _PROTEIN_ of many genes important for anthocyanin biosynthesis . the results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is important for sugar signaling in vegetative tissue and for normal male gametophyte function .
two insertional mutant alleles _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were used in this study . homozygous lines were identified using pcr on genomic dna . figure shows a diagram of the _PROTEIN_ gene containing three exons with the _PROTEIN_ insertion in the first exon and the _PROTEIN_ insertion in the second exon . growth of homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant plants was not different from wild type . _PROTEIN_ seedlings did not differ from wild type in primary root length _PROTEIN_ seedlings had a root length of mm _PROTEIN_ had an average root length of mm and the root length for columbia was mm after d of growth on murashige and skoog _METHOD_ medium . no differences in fertility were observed for _PROTEIN_ mutants compared to wild type this is of interest considering that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in pollen . both the number of seeds per silique and silique length were not statistically different in col and _PROTEIN_ col had seeds/silique and siliques were mm long whereas _PROTEIN_ had seeds/silique and siliques were mm long . _PROTEIN_ is also _PROTEIN_ in young trichomes suggesting a role in trichome development . however the _PROTEIN_ mutants displayed no obvious defects in trichome development perhaps due to redundant _PROTEIN_ of other suc transporters in trichomes . reverse transcription pcr indicated that wild type seedlings grown in liquid _METHOD_ supplemented with suc produced more _PROTEIN_ mrna than those grown on _METHOD_ alone . quantitative rt pcr confirmed this finding _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels were fold higher in suc grown plants than in those grown without suc . suc induced _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was also found in transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ fusions _PROTEIN_ . figure shows an increase in gus enzyme activity in plants grown either for d or h in medium containing suc compared to plants grown in medium lacking suc . plants transformed with an _PROTEIN_ promoter gus construct do not have detectable gus activity in roots and suc application did not induce gus _PROTEIN_ in roots in _PROTEIN_ promoter gus lines . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in root tissue was analyzed at the cellular level using vibratome sections of gus stained transgenic arabidopsis lines _PROTEIN_ . citation previously showed that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in the root vasculature in the elongation zone of the root and sites of _PROTEIN_ root formation . root cross sections show that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is not limited to cells within the vascular cylinder _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in the pericycle and endodermis as well . treatment with suc such as in figure resulted in extension of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to the cortex and epidermis . _PROTEIN_ is highly _PROTEIN_ in pollen . figure shows confocal images of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes where _PROTEIN_ was localized in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _METHOD_ was also observed in unidentified internal structures associated with callous plugs and cytoplasmic _METHOD_ was more pronounced at the tip probably associated with _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ biosynthesis and _LOCATION_ trafficking . when _PROTEIN_ plants were backcrossed to wild type the population did not show normal mendelian segregation . only of the plants were homozygous for _PROTEIN_ instead of the expected . to determine whether this was caused by embryo lethality or a gametophyte defect reciprocal crosses of _PROTEIN_ heterozygous plants to col wild type were made . when the pollen for the cross was from the _PROTEIN_ het only of the progeny were het for the _PROTEIN_ allele instead of the expected of the progeny indicating that transmission of the mutation through the male gametophyte was reduced . whereas when the female parent was the _PROTEIN_ het of the plants in the generation were het for the mutation . the pollen defect could be rescued by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under its own promoter in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background . _PROTEIN_ homozygous mutants carrying one copy of the _PROTEIN_ transgene do not show normal mendelian segregation of the transgene . mutants carrying one copy of _PROTEIN_ transgenically should have a higher rate of transgene transmission through the male gametophyte because the pollen carrying the transgene should show greater rates of transmission than the mutant pollen without the complementing transgene . as expected significantly more than of the progeny of three independent lines of _PROTEIN_ mutants het for a transgenic _PROTEIN_ construct carried the transgene . one line did not show complementation probably due to an incomplete transgene insertion or positional effects and was not investigated further . reciprocal crosses demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ mutants segregate aberrantly numbers in parentheses indicate the number of plants with an insertion/total progeny counted . p value is calculated from a two tailed t test . complementation of _PROTEIN_ mutants with the wild type _PROTEIN_ gene or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion numbers in parentheses indicate the number of plants resistant to hygromycin/total progeny counted . p value is calculated from a two tailed t test . four independent transgenic lines were selfed and the percent of the progeny that were hygromycin resistant were counted . because _PROTEIN_ is highly _PROTEIN_ during pollen maturation the effect of the _PROTEIN_ mutation on pollen germination was analyzed . in vitro only of _PROTEIN_ pollen and of _PROTEIN_ pollen germinated whereas of wild type pollen germinated . this was not due to low viability of the mutant pollen there was no difference in the viability of _PROTEIN_ pollen compared to wild type based on alexander 's viability stain . to test for complementation _PROTEIN_ mutant lines homozygous for either or _METHOD_ were generated . both constructs were able to complement the mutant phenotype as indicated by pollen germination rates that were similar to wild type . replacing suc in the germination medium with equimolar glc did not improve the germination rate of _PROTEIN_ pollen however there was a reduction in wild type pollen germination rates . the lack of rescue of the pollen germination phenotype with glc indicated that potentially pollen development was affected because suc transporters do not transport glc . to attempt to characterize an effect of _PROTEIN_ mutation on pollen development we looked for ultrastructural defects in mutant pollen by transmission electron microscopy . the pollen coat is important for proper pollen grain adhesion and hydration but appeared identical in both the _PROTEIN_ mutant and the wild type . no differences between mutant and wild type pollen were observed . fatty acid accumulation occurs during pollen development and oil bodies supply energy required for germination and pollen tube growth . to assess the stored energy status of the pollen the fatty acid content of pollen grains was examined . fatty acids were extracted from both wild type and the _PROTEIN_ mutant pollen grains and analyzed by gas chromatography . there was no difference in the types of fatty acids present . total fatty acids in mutant pollen were not significantly different compared to wild type _PROTEIN_ . fatty acid content of col and _PROTEIN_ pollen citation reported that arabidopsis accumulates anthocyanins in response to suc . the authors noted that the effect was suc specific and not observed in response to glc fru or sorbitol . figure a to c shows plants grown with suc . wild type and het plants accumulated visible anthocyanins in cotyledons and at the apex of the hypocotyl whereas _PROTEIN_ mutants did not indicating that the phenotype is recessive . all plants looked similar when grown on medium lacking suc . _PROTEIN_ plants accumulated anthocyanins in response to high light indicating that _PROTEIN_ plants are not impaired in anthocyanin biosynthesis in response to an alternative stimulus . figure shows quantification of accumulated anthocyanins . when _PROTEIN_ seedlings were grown continuously on suc or maltose they did not accumulate as many anthocyanins as wild type seedlings . however when suc concentration was raised to there was no difference in anthocyanin accumulation between wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutants . nevertheless mutants and wild type showed differences in anthocyanin accumulation at suc if the plants were assayed after being grown first on _METHOD_ medium without suc and then incubated with suc for h . _PROTEIN_ also showed reduced anthocyanin accumulation when grown continuously on suc . and as expected two independent lines of _PROTEIN_ plants _PROTEIN_ an _PROTEIN_ transgene showed wild type like suc induced anthocyanin accumulation . assaying radioactive suc uptake into whole seedlings grown for d in liquid _METHOD_ showed that _PROTEIN_ mutants did not accumulate less suc than wild type . after min incubation in mm labeled suc wild type accumulated pmol/seedling whereas _PROTEIN_ accumulated pmol/seedling . _PROTEIN_ of many genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis is increased by exogenous suc . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ is necessary for this process we performed microarray analysis on _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants that were grown in liquid _METHOD_ medium for d and then h in liquid _METHOD_ medium supplemented with suc . labeled rna was hybridized to affymetrix genechip _PROTEIN_ microarrays for each of the two genotypes to find up and down regulated genes . table iv shows normalized signal from individual hybridizations for the _PROTEIN_ mutant and col treated with suc for h and data from citation for arabidopsis wild type seedlings treated similarly . genes in table iv were identified by citation as regulated by suc and involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis . the data are sorted by fold signal difference between _PROTEIN_ and col . dihydroflavonol reductase is a downstream enzyme in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway that is regulated by the _PROTEIN_ complex . _PROTEIN_ is a suc induced dihydroflavonol reductase and is _PROTEIN_ at a fold higher level in col versus _PROTEIN_ . many other genes show a similar pattern _PROTEIN_ flavonol o _PROTEIN_ cinnamate hydroxylase flavonol synthase _PROTEIN_ isomerase and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ synthase are all strongly induced by suc and show lower _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ as compared to col . _GENE_ encoding a putative _PROTEIN_ isomerase was the only anthocyanin biosynthetic gene found to be _PROTEIN_ at a higher level in the mutant than wild type . on a whole genome level a contingency table and fisher exact test showed that genes up regulated by suc have higher _PROTEIN_ in col compared to _PROTEIN_ . likewise genes down regulated by suc showed lower _PROTEIN_ in col compared to _PROTEIN_ . in summary microarray analysis revealed that _PROTEIN_ mutants have reduced response to exogenous suc . effect of _PROTEIN_ mutation on _PROTEIN_ of suc responsive genesa in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway seedlings were grown in liquid culture without suc and then moved to medium without suc _METHOD_ for h or to medium containing suc for h or h _PROTEIN_ . normalized signal values are normalized with the mas algorithm and scaled to . each column of signal values represents an independent biological replicate .
plants were grown under long day conditions at unless otherwise noted . for analysis of root growth plants were grown vertically on _METHOD_ plates supplemented with suc . results for root length silique length and seeds per silique are presented as mean se . in vitro pollen germination was determined using liquid medium modified after citation . for some assays suc was replaced with an equimolar amount of glc . anthers were removed from one or two stage flowers . the anthers were briefly agitated in a drop of germination medium on a glass slide . the slide was placed in a humidor for h and then a coverslip was applied and the number of germinated pollen grains was counted . for each replicate at least pollen grains were scored . insertional mutants were ordered from the arabidopsis biological resource center . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were screened for homozygous mutants using pcr . the following primers were used _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ untranslated region and . anthocyanins were extracted as described by citation with minor modifications . in brief plants were grown in liquid culture _METHOD_ for d and then extracted in of hcl in ethanol . then of water was added . a sample was taken for spectrophotometer readings at and nm . the remaining extract was cleaned with of chloroform and another sample was taken for spectrophotometer readings at nm . anthocyanin content is presented on a fresh weight basis . transgenic arabidopsis plants with _PROTEIN_ whole gene clones are described by citation . pcr was used to generate a whole gene _PROTEIN_ fragment . the primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were used with the vector _PROTEIN_ containing the _PROTEIN_ whole gene as the template . the pcr product was ta cloned into . this plasmid was then recombined with either or using lr recombinase . plant transformations were done as by citation . transformed plants were selected on mg hygromycin . rna was extracted from d old seedlings of col and _PROTEIN_ mutants using the rneasy plant mini kit . rt pcr was performed on of rna using the qiagen one step rt pcr kit . rt pcr was performed with cycles each with min s extension time and an annealing temperature of . the following primers were used _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . rna was extracted using the rneasy kit from d old liquid grown seedlings . first strand cdna was synthesized from of total rna with superscript iii reverse transcriptase and quantification on a lightcycler instrument with platinum sybr green . quantitative pcr supermix udg was performed according to the manufacturer 's instructions . the quantitative rt pcr program was as follows min at min at followed by cycles of denaturation for s at and annealing/extension for s at . _PROTEIN_ levels were normalized to actin _PROTEIN_ levels . quantitative rt pcr experiments were performed on two independent biological samples and on three technical replicates . the following primers were used actin and r and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . transgenic arabidopsis plants were vacuum infiltrated with gus staining solution _PROTEIN_ . plants were incubated overnight at and cleared in ethanol . ten seedlings grown for d in liquid _METHOD_ were incubated for min in mm suc and then washed and incubated for min in _PROTEIN_ . utlima gold scintillation cocktail was added and samples were counted . pollen was collected by vacuuming open flowers daily and stored at until extraction . vacuum collection involved filtering through a nylon mesh and collection on a nylon filter . the filter and pollen were placed directly into of n methanolic hcl containing of heptadecanoic acid as an internal standard . samples were heated to for h and then nylon filters were removed . equal volumes of nacl and hexane were added . the hexane layer was collected and fatty acid methyl esters were analyzed and quantified by gas chromatography . total protein analysis was done on the aqueous fraction after hexane extraction . for microarray analysis seeds stratified for d at were grown in liquid _METHOD_ for d then in liquid _METHOD_ medium supplemented with suc for h. rna was extracted using the rneasy plant mini kit . biotin labeling of the rna hybridization to the affymetrix genechip arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ genome array and scanning of the _PROTEIN_ were all performed at the university of minnesota biomedical genomics center microarray facility . data were normalized using the mas algorithm and scaled to . present or absent calls were also made with mas . significant genes q values and fold change were generated using s adenosyl met .
