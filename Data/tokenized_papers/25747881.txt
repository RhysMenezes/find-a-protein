obligate biotrophs such as the powdery mildew pathogens deliver effectors to the host cell and obtain nutrients from the infection site . the interface between the plant host and the biotrophic pathogen thus represents a major battleground for plant pathogen interactions . increasing evidence shows that cellular trafficking plays an important role in plant immunity . here we report that arabidopsis thaliana enhanced disease plays a negative role in resistance to powdery mildew and that the enhanced disease resistance in mutants requires salicylic acid signaling . _PROTEIN_ localizes to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and endosomal compartments . genetic analyses show that and _PROTEIN_ function in the same genetic pathway . _PROTEIN_ and accumulate at the penetration site of powdery mildew infection and physically interacts with _PROTEIN_ recruiting _PROTEIN_ to the fungal penetration site . in addition interacts with _PROTEIN_ heavy _PROTEIN_ and mutants show reduced endocytosis rates . taken together our data indicate that associates with _PROTEIN_ and modulates plant immunity by regulating the relocation of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis .
to study the molecular interactions between arabidopsis and powdery mildew we previously screened ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenized arabidopsis columbia plants for enhanced disease resistance to g. cichoracearum . among three mutants identified in this screen _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have been described here we describe our characterization of the mutant . the mutants did not show any growth defects under short day conditions however they displayed mild hypersensitive response like lesions under long day conditions at _PROTEIN_ growth stages . to characterize powdery mildew resistance in we infected week old plants with g. cichoracearum under short day conditions . the wild type plants were susceptible and supported abundant conidiophores on their leaves at d after inoculation . however the mutants showed fewer conidiophores and _METHOD_ necrotic lesions on the leaves at dai . to further monitor fungal reproduction we counted the conidiophores per colony in wild type and plants . as shown in figure significantly fewer conidiophores were produced on leaves than on wild type leaves at dai indicating that the growth of powdery mildew fungus was inhibited in the mutant . activation of plant defenses often involves the production of and the deposition of callose . to examine whether mutants accumulate more than the wild type after infection we used diaminobenzidine hydrochloride to stain infected leaves at dai with g. cichoracearum . the mutants showed more pronounced accumulation in the infection site than did wild type plants . to monitor callose deposition in wild type and mutant plants we performed aniline blue staining on the infected leaves at dai and found that the mutants showed more callose deposition at the infection site than the wild type . to investigate whether the mutation affects the _PROTEIN_ of defense related genes we examined the transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in wild type and mutant plants at different time points after g. cichoracearum infection using real time pcr . both the wild type and showed relatively low accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts before infection . the transcript levels of pr genes increased after inoculation in both the wild type and but significantly more transcripts of pr genes accumulated in plants than in wild type plants at and dai . these observations indicate that the mutants induced the defense response more rapidly than the wild type plants did . sa jasmonic acid and ethylene signaling pathways play important roles in plant defense responses . to examine whether those pathways affect mediated resistance we constructed double mutants and assessed whether mutations in those pathways alter powdery mildew resistance in . the _PROTEIN_ mutation which disrupts sa perception and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations which reduce levels of pathogen induced sa suppressed mediated enhanced resistance to powdery mildew and mildew induced cell death . by contrast mutations in _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ blocked the ethylene response or the ja response respectively and did not affect resistance and mildew induced cell death . these data indicate that mediated resistance and mildew induced cell death phenotypes are sa dependent but ethylene and ja independent . to further assess the role of sa in mediated resistance we measured sa levels in the wild type and before and after infection with g. cichoracearum . in the absence of pathogen the mutants and wild type plants had similar levels of free and total sa by contrast at dai sa accumulated at much higher levels in than in the wild type . these data indicate that higher sa levels in mutants cause the enhanced disease resistance and mildew induced cell death . the mutation was identified by standard map based cloning . a c to t transition at nucleotide in _GENE_ was found in and this transition causes an early stop in the predicted protein sequence . to confirm that _GENE_ is a genomic clone of _GENE_ was transformed into plants . among transgenic plants obtained displayed the wild type susceptible phenotype at dai when infected with g. cichoracearum indicating that the _GENE_ genomic clone complemented the phenotype . as an additional confirmation we also examined the phenotypes of two t dna insertion lines of _GENE_ and . no full length transcript of _GENE_ could be detected in or in these two lines indicating that the _PROTEIN_ of is disrupted in these three mutant lines . these two mutants showed enhanced disease resistance and mildew induced cell death upon powdery mildew infection at dai which was very similar to the phenotype of . taken together these data indicate that _GENE_ is the gene responsible for the phenotypes therefore we designate _GENE_ as . encodes a protein of amino acids with no assigned function and no clear homolog could be identified in the arabidopsis genome . a search for motifs in the primary sequence of using the eukaryotic linear motif server identified three types of structural elements in a coiled coil domain four low complexity regions _PROTEIN_ and a _PROTEIN_ domain of unknown function . the cc domain and _PROTEIN_ often function as protein interaction domains for a wide variety of proteins . to investigate the subcellular localization of we made a fusion of to green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ it from the _METHOD_ construct _METHOD_ and transformed it into mutant plants . _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ as a full length protein and complemented the phenotypes indicating that _METHOD_ was functional . a representative homozygous _METHOD_ transgenic line was chosen to examine localization . in root tip cells of d old seedlings time lapse analysis revealed that _METHOD_ displayed dynamic intracellular movement which partially overlapped with . _METHOD_ appears to localize on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and on dot like intracellular structures in the _LOCATION_ . to determine the subcellular localization of we assessed the colocalization of _METHOD_ with several organelle markers including mcherry _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mcherry _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mcherry _LOCATION_ and hdel mcherry _LOCATION_ and examined _METHOD_ in root tips of transgenic plants . microscopy and quantification analysis showed that a large portion of _METHOD_ protein overlapped with the tgn/ee marker _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ endosome marker _PROTEIN_ and the cis _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ but a smaller portion of _METHOD_ overlapped with the _LOCATION_ marker hdel . taken together these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ localizes at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and in endosomal compartments and displays dynamic movement in cells . we further examined the subcellular localization of in epidermal cells after g. cichoracearum infection using the _METHOD_ transgenic line . the _METHOD_ signal was observed in epidermal cells in uninfected leaves and also showed intracellular movement . at h after inoculation with g. cichoracearum _METHOD_ accumulated under the penetration peg at the infection site in epidermal cells but overall the _METHOD_ protein levels _PROTEIN_ at hai with g. cichoracearum . to further confirm the accumulation of _METHOD_ at the site of infection we also examined _METHOD_ localization at hai with the cis _LOCATION_ localized protein n acetylglucosaminyltransferase i fused to _METHOD_ as a control . fungal structures were labeled with propidium iodide . we found that _METHOD_ accumulated at penetration sites at hai while there was no obvious difference in the subcellular localization of nag _METHOD_ before and after inoculation . to determine whether accumulates at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or papillae at the penetration site after infection we used plasmolysis of infected leaves at hai . as shown in supplemental figure _METHOD_ accumulated in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but not in papillae . to further characterize the mutant we crossed with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ two well characterized powdery mildew resistance mutants and examined the phenotypes of the double mutants . the _PROTEIN_ mutant showed more cell death and fewer fungal spores than the _PROTEIN_ and single mutants indicating that the _PROTEIN_ mutation enhanced the phenotype . however the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants showed no significant differences in growth of fungal spores . a missense mutation in _PROTEIN_ suppressed the _PROTEIN_ phenotype . to further examine the relationship between _PROTEIN_ and we crossed _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with keg and generated double and triple mutants . the keg mutation suppressed the enhanced disease resistance of and _PROTEIN_ mutants indicating that mediated resistance also requires _PROTEIN_ . previous work showed that keg suppresses _PROTEIN_ mediated resistance but not _PROTEIN_ mediated resistance indicating that keg specifically suppresses _PROTEIN_ . the observations that keg suppressed and _PROTEIN_ and that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ displayed similar levels of resistance suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ act in the same genetic pathway . consistent with this notion _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ kinase activation increased in mutants upon infection by g. cichoracearum and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations also suppressed powdery mildew resistance in similar to the _PROTEIN_ mutant . since _PROTEIN_ and displayed similar powdery mildew resistance and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may act in the same genetic pathway we hypothesized that may associate with _PROTEIN_ to modulate plant immunity . to test this hypothesis we performed yeast two hybrid assays to examine whether interacts with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . could interact with the n terminal domain of _PROTEIN_ and full length _PROTEIN_ but not with the c terminal domain of _PROTEIN_ or with _PROTEIN_ . to determine which domain of is responsible for the interaction with _PROTEIN_ we conducted a deletion analysis of and examined the interactions of the deleted variants by yeast two hybrid assays . as shown in figure a variant of with only the cc domain could interact with _PROTEIN_ while the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domain or cc domain deletion form of could not interact with _PROTEIN_ . these data indicate that the cc domain of is necessary and sufficient for interaction with _PROTEIN_ . to further confirm the interactions of _PROTEIN_ and we performed bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation by fusing _PROTEIN_ and deletion _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ to the n or c terminal fragment of yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and transiently _PROTEIN_ those constructs in n. benthamiana leaves . we observed reconstituted _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in leaves cotransformed with driven yn _PROTEIN_ and yc _PROTEIN_ as well as yn _PROTEIN_ and yc or the yc cc domain but not in leaves cotransformed with yn _PROTEIN_ and yc or other yc deletions indicating that the cc domain interacts with _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana consistent with the results of the yeast two hybrid assays . to validate the interaction of and _PROTEIN_ we also performed coimmunoprecipitation assays in stable transgenic arabidopsis plants . we crossed _METHOD_ plants with plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ driven by the native _PROTEIN_ promoter and used the plants that _PROTEIN_ both _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in co ip assays with plants that _PROTEIN_ both _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ as a negative control . we extracted total protein and immunoprecipitated _PROTEIN_ using anti _PROTEIN_ antibody and then detected the presence or absence of with anti _METHOD_ antibody . was detected only in the precipitates of leaves that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ but not in the negative control plants indicating that interacts with _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . taken together these observations indicate that interacts with _PROTEIN_ . since _PROTEIN_ interacts with we then examined whether colocalizes with _PROTEIN_ . we first transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ mcherry in n. benthamiana leaves . _PROTEIN_ appears to colocalize with in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and endosomal compartments . we then examined transgenic plants that coexpressed _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ mcherry . similarly _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ mcherry colocalized in endosomal compartments in root cells . since _PROTEIN_ interacts with we next examined whether _PROTEIN_ and have similar localization patterns . _PROTEIN_ also shows dynamic intracellular movement . as accumulated at powdery mildew infection sites we then examined whether _PROTEIN_ also accumulates at infection sites and whether the mutation affects this localization . we thus crossed the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plant with the mutant to generate _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants . we did not observe an obvious difference in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization in wild type and backgrounds in the absence of powdery mildew pathogen . upon infection _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ also accumulated at the infection site at hai in wild type leaves however _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulated at much lower levels at infection sites in leaves . to quantify the level of accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ we calculated the frequency of focal accumulations of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at infection sites in wild type and plants according to the previously described method . as shown in figure the frequency of focal accumulations of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in mutants was much lower than in the wild type indicating that the mutation compromised the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at the fungal infection site . similar to _METHOD_ plasmolysis analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ also accumulated at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ not in papillae after infection with g. cichoracearum . taken together our data suggested that _PROTEIN_ moves to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ around powdery mildew infection sites and that plays an important role in _PROTEIN_ relocation . as the cc domain of is necessary for interaction with _PROTEIN_ we examined whether _PROTEIN_ localization was affected in the cc domain deletion background . we made an cc domain deletion _PROTEIN_ construct and transformed it alone or with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct into . the cc domain deletion _PROTEIN_ construct did not complement the phenotype indicating that function requires the cc domain . we also compared _PROTEIN_ localization in wild type and cc domain deletion plants after powdery mildew infection . the localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the and cc domain deletion background was similar as both show defects in focal accumulation to the site of mildew infection indicating that the cc domain deletion construct could not function as the full length protein . to examine whether _PROTEIN_ affected localization we examined _METHOD_ localization in wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants after powdery mildew infection at hai . _METHOD_ accumulated at the infection site in wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants and no significant difference was observed between the wild type and _PROTEIN_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ did not affect the localization of . to examine whether powdery mildew triggers continuous accumulation of _PROTEIN_ and we performed _METHOD_ recovery after photobleaching of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ leaves at g. cichoracearum penetration sites and distal _LOCATION_ sites . at the penetration site the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal recovered to less than in min compared with before bleaching and _METHOD_ displayed a similar pattern recovering to less than in min . by contrast at a distal _LOCATION_ site the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ signals showed rapid recovery after bleaching . these data suggested that _PROTEIN_ and proteins were not continuously delivered to penetration sites but were delivered one time and retained at these sites . these results are comparable to previous findings that focal accumulations of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ after b. graminis f sp hordei infection result from single delivery events rather than continuous delivery . the citation reported that could interact with _PROTEIN_ a major component of clathrin coated vesicles in cme and clathrin mediated pathways in yeast two hybrid assays . to confirm the interactions between _PROTEIN_ and in planta we performed bifc assays using n. benthamiana . as shown in figure we observed _METHOD_ signal in leaves coexpressing _PROTEIN_ and full length the cc domain or the _PROTEIN_ domain but not the _PROTEIN_ domain confirming that interacts with _PROTEIN_ and that the cc and _PROTEIN_ domains may be responsible for this interaction . the interaction between and _PROTEIN_ suggested that could function in clathrin mediated pathways . to further confirm the interaction between and _PROTEIN_ we performed co ip assays in stable transgenic arabidopsis plants . we crossed _METHOD_ plants with plants _PROTEIN_ myc n _PROTEIN_ driven by the promoter and used the plants that _PROTEIN_ both _METHOD_ and myc n _PROTEIN_ in co ip assays with plants that _PROTEIN_ only myc n _PROTEIN_ as a negative control . _PROTEIN_ was only detected in the precipitates of leaves that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and myc n _PROTEIN_ but not in the negative control plants indicating that interacts with _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . the _PROTEIN_ mutants display reduced endocytosis rates as measured by uptake of the endocytic tracer dye . to assess whether also functions in endocytosis we performed uptake tests on wild type and plants using _PROTEIN_ as an endocytosis deficient control . the intracellular accumulation of showed clear labeling of endosomes in the wild type within min however and _PROTEIN_ mutants showed much less labeling at the same time indicating that mutants show reduced endocytosis rates . by contrast we did not observe any difference in uptake between the wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutants . to examine whether _PROTEIN_ affects powdery mildew resistance we infected the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants with g. cichoracearum . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants supported significantly less fungal growth than the wild type although the resistance in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants was not as strong as in the mutant . in addition the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants showed higher and callose accumulation and stronger activation of _PROTEIN_ than the wild type . the callose accumulation and activation of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were similar to those in but the accumulation of was significantly lower than that observed in mutants . taken together our data indicated that _PROTEIN_ contributes to powdery mildew resistance . as the _PROTEIN_ mutants displayed an like phenotype and _PROTEIN_ interacts with we then asked whether _PROTEIN_ contributes to the relocation of _PROTEIN_ and upon powdery mildew infection . to address this question we transformed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ constructs into _PROTEIN_ to generate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants . we then examined the localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ was similar in wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants before powdery mildew infection . however both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ accumulated at much lower levels at infection sites in _PROTEIN_ than wild type leaves at hai . quantification analysis also confirmed those results .
