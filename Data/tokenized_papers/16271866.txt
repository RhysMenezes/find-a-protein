background plants produce leaf and flower primordia from a specialized tissue called the shoot apical meristem . genetic studies have identified a large number of genes that affect various aspects of primordium development including positioning growth and differentiation . so far however a detailed understanding of the spatio temporal sequence of events leading to primordium development has not been established . results we use confocal imaging of green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ reporter genes in living plants to monitor the _PROTEIN_ patterns of multiple proteins and genes involved in flower primordial developmental processes . by monitoring the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the auxin efflux facilitator and the _PROTEIN_ of the auxin responsive reporter we reveal stereotypical _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ changes which together with auxin induction experiments suggest that cycles of auxin build up and depletion accompany and may direct different stages of primordium development . imaging of multiple _METHOD_ protein fusions shows that these dynamics also correlate with the specification of primordial boundary domains organ _PROTEIN_ axes and the sites of floral meristem initiation . conclusions these results provide new insight into auxin transport dynamics during primordial positioning and suggest a role for auxin transport in influencing primordial cell type .
previous work has indicated that primordium positioning is mediated by localized auxin concentrations that are in turn patterned by the activity of the auxin efflux mediator _PROTEIN_ . in the meristem the _PROTEIN_ protein is _PROTEIN_ predominantly in the epidermis and provasculature . in cells located in the vicinity of incipient primordia _PROTEIN_ protein is localized _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ closest to sites of subsequent primordial emergence . to investigate _PROTEIN_ dynamics we used confocal based live imaging of a functional _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein . we assessed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by identifying arcs of signal in low resolution images that we found by analysis at high resolution to correspond to signal within cell corners and therefore to indicate the direction of auxin efflux . overall our observed pattern of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ resembles previous immunological results except that we find striking patterns of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ throughout the meristem epidermis that change according to the stage of primordial development occurring at different positions . for convenience we use p to designate primordia that have clearly grown out from the meristem while i designates incipient primordia before the onset of rapid growth . both primordia and incipient primordia are numbered in order of appearance with p designating the youngest primordium and i designating the oldest incipient primordium . from examining _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in primordia of different ages in multiple plants a stereotypical pattern of activity can be discerned . before an incipient primordium is first marked by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ at this location is directed from one adjacent site toward the other adjacent site . a site is first marked by relatively high levels of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is directed toward this site from both adjacent sites . at this stage _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is limited to the epidermis _PROTEIN_ . at slightly _PROTEIN_ stages _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ levels increase and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ becomes directed toward these sites from three adjacent primordia . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in subepidermal layers also becomes detectable at these stages . as primordial growth starts to accelerate _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in epidermal cells located adaxial to the primordium reverses _PROTEIN_ from being directed toward the primordium to being directed away from the primordium and back toward the meristem center and adjacent regions . subsequently _PROTEIN_ becomes reduced within the primordial epidermis but starts to reappear again by stage two of flower development . in subepidermal cells below the primordium _PROTEIN_ becomes restricted to the presumed provascular tissues . to better understand changes in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we conducted time lapse confocal imaging of growing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . time lapse images confirm the stereotypical pattern of _PROTEIN_ build up followed by _PROTEIN_ at primordial positions as well as the temporal correlation between reversals at older primordia and newly localized _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ at incipient primordia . however we also find that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ shifts relative to the underlying cells in directions that are correlated with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . after _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ reversal _METHOD_ signal moves from the site of reversal toward adjacent regions as well as toward the primordium tip leaving a zone of low _PROTEIN_ where the reversal originally took place . the adjacent regions that subsequently show increased _PROTEIN_ correspond to sites of incipient primordia . these observations show that _PROTEIN_ behavior associated with flower primordium development can be divided into two phases . initially the establishment of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ toward cells destined to form an incipient primordium is correlated with a reversal in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in cells surrounding an older adjacent primordium . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels then increase in cells located at the _PROTEIN_ focus and this is correlated with further _PROTEIN_ reversals in adjacent primordia . the second phase is characterized by a subsequent rapid reversal in _PROTEIN_ that occurs predominantly in adaxial cells surrounding the primordium . as this occurs _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ also shifts abaxially to form a new focus of _PROTEIN_ at the primordium tip and adaxially to adjacent positions destined to form new primordia . microarray data indicating that _PROTEIN_ may be auxin regulated in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ as well as the consistent correlation between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ level prompted us to investigate _PROTEIN_ transcription in response to auxin using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction . we found that treatment of dissected wild type inflorescences with indole acetic acid resulted in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels increasing by a _PROTEIN_ of after min . a stronger response occurred after treatment of _PROTEIN_ apices with mm iaa when after min we detected an upregulation of _PROTEIN_ by a _PROTEIN_ of . although these exogenous iaa concentrations are much higher than those thought to occur physiologically similar exogenous concentrations of iaa are required to induce a consistent growth response in both wild type and mutant apical _METHOD_ suggesting that high exogenous iaa concentrations applied to shoot tissues are diluted to physiologically relevant concentrations in vivo . to examine the effects of exogenous auxin on the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pattern in more detail we conducted time lapse confocal imaging of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ treated with mm naphthaleneacetic acid a form of auxin that can diffuse into cells . we were able to detect an increase in _PROTEIN_ beginning after hr and increasing up to hr post treatment in primordial cells away from which _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was directed presumably after reversal . _PROTEIN_ also increased in subepidermal cells located at primordial boundaries . we also tested whether the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ pattern was sensitive to the auxin transport inhibitor n naphthylphthalamic acid . after treating _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ for hr with npa we observed increasing delocalization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ that by hr had clearly spread to subepidermal cells surrounding the presumed vascular tissue that initially lacked _PROTEIN_ . these experiments indicate that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pattern is dependent on the distribution of auxin in the meristem which in turn depends on auxin transport . since _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ levels are also correlated with the observed changes in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ our data suggests that changes in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ associated with different stages of primordial development drive dynamic changes in auxin concentration which then influence _PROTEIN_ transcription . to gain further evidence of a correlation between auxin concentration dynamics and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we visualized the activity of the auxin responsive promoter driving three tandem copies of venus a rapidly folding _METHOD_ variant fused to a _LOCATION_ localization sequence here termed _PROTEIN_ in combination with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . as predicted we found that local upregulation of both markers occurred simultaneously at young sites predicted to form primordia . in contrast to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ which _PROTEIN_ in primordia after _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ reverses toward the meristem in adaxial cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ persists after reversal . however by time lapse imaging we found that these _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells either corresponded to or were daughters of cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ before reversal suggesting the possibility that persistent _PROTEIN_ might be due to venus perdurance . to test this hypothesis we selectively radiated cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ at primordial positions with nm laser light until venus _METHOD_ became undetectable . we then assessed the recovery of _METHOD_ in these cells over time . of five _METHOD_ tested three showed _METHOD_ recovery specifically in cells within incipient primordia but not in cells located in adjacent older primordia while two plants showed no recovery at either type of position . overall these results support the proposal that transcription from the promoter is active during the early stages of primordial specification and that like _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ around the time that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ reverses . de novo _PROTEIN_ in cells unrelated to those _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ before _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ reversal was detected at a _PROTEIN_ stage again correlated with the reappearance of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . to summarize both the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ data support the proposal that reversals in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ correlate with and are likely to cause changes in auxin levels within developing primordia . the _PROTEIN_ gene is required both for meristem formation and _PROTEIN_ . in situ hybridization analysis shows that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ throughout most of the inflorescence meristem but is specifically downregulated at positions where specification of the cryptic floral bract is thought to occur . to determine when and where _PROTEIN_ is downregulated relative to _PROTEIN_ we visualized an _PROTEIN_ venus fusion protein under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter designated pstm _PROTEIN_ venus in combination with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the overall _PROTEIN_ pattern of the _PROTEIN_ marker is similar to that found by in situ hybridization analysis with _PROTEIN_ encompassing most of the meristem . examination of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ both pstm _PROTEIN_ venus and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ reveals that pstm _PROTEIN_ venus _PROTEIN_ is downregulated at locations where _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is upregulated . this complementary pattern starts to become apparent at the earliest position marked by localized _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ showing that _PROTEIN_ marks primordial positions with similar timing to _PROTEIN_ . the reduction in pstm _PROTEIN_ venus _PROTEIN_ in the vicinity of high _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is also evident several cell layers below the meristem epidermis in regions corresponding to the presumptive provascular cells . we also note that pstm _PROTEIN_ venus _PROTEIN_ strengthens in a boundary like domain abaxial to those cells in which _PROTEIN_ is directed toward the meristem and away from the primordium . this is most noticeable in transgenic lines in which pstm _PROTEIN_ venus _PROTEIN_ levels are low . lastly we also note a reduction in pstm _PROTEIN_ venus levels toward the meristem center relative to the periphery in cells below the . previous work has shown that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes are required for proper organ separation and that in mutants in which auxin patterning is disrupted the _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are also disrupted suggesting a link between auxin patterning and cuc gene function . to start to investigate the temporal and spatial relationship between the cuc genes and _PROTEIN_ mediated auxin transport patterns we fused the _PROTEIN_ coding region to venus and _PROTEIN_ it under the _PROTEIN_ promoter designated _PROTEIN_ venus together with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ venus is _PROTEIN_ in boundary like domains surrounding primordia in a pattern similar to that previously reported from in situ hybridization experiments . however weak _PROTEIN_ is also detected in the epidermal cells of the central zone . like pstm _PROTEIN_ venus we found _PROTEIN_ venus to be downregulated at _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ foci . this downregulation _METHOD_ to occur at an earlier stage than pstm _PROTEIN_ venus and is more extensive . like pstm _PROTEIN_ venus _PROTEIN_ venus is specifically upregulated in those cells near primordia from which _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was directed after its reversal . these data suggest that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are regulated in a similar manner although with different timing or sensitivity . furthermore they show strikingly complementary _PROTEIN_ patterns compared to _PROTEIN_ both at _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ foci and in boundary regions from which _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is directed . the _PROTEIN_ gene is involved in regulating axillary meristem formation organ _PROTEIN_ and meristem size and is _PROTEIN_ in a similar pattern to other related members of the hd _PROTEIN_ family of transcription _PROTEIN_ such as phabulosa and phavoluta . it is also thought to mark primordia at a particularly young stage . to monitor _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ dynamics we constructed a functional _PROTEIN_ venus fusion and _PROTEIN_ it under the _PROTEIN_ promoter . we found the prev _PROTEIN_ venus transgene to be _PROTEIN_ in an identical manner to the reported endogenous transcription pattern . prev _PROTEIN_ venus _PROTEIN_ is present in the upper layers of the cz of the meristem as well as in finger like domains extending out to developing primordia . prev _PROTEIN_ venus signal is first evidently associated with primordial positions between zero and one plastochron after _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ first localizes and the _PROTEIN_ domain is contiguous with _PROTEIN_ in the cz . however before this newly localized _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ always appears adjacent to prev _PROTEIN_ venus _PROTEIN_ cells in the cz . as _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal increases at primordial initiation sites the prev _PROTEIN_ venus _PROTEIN_ domain extends outward to overlap with the adaxial half of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ domain . this pattern of overlap also extends below the epidermis along the presumptive provascular cells marked by newly localized _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . at approximately the same time that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ reverses and _PROTEIN_ levels _PROTEIN_ in subepidermal cells prev _PROTEIN_ venus _PROTEIN_ is lost from the cells located between the primordium and the cz thus isolating _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ from the cz . to summarize prev _PROTEIN_ venus _PROTEIN_ extends halfway into the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ domain from nearby adjacent cz cells that already _PROTEIN_ prev _PROTEIN_ venus . adaxial localized prev _PROTEIN_ venus _PROTEIN_ associated with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is then _PROTEIN_ during primordial outgrowth and separation from the cz . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ also marks the adaxial boundary of abaxially _PROTEIN_ genes we examined _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in combination with _LOCATION_ localized dsred under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter . _PROTEIN_ is a member of the yabby gene family of transcription _PROTEIN_ and functions to specify abaxial cell types and to promote flower development and _PROTEIN_ organ expansion . pfil dsred first marks primordia between one and two plastochrons _PROTEIN_ than upregulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . at inception pfil dsred _PROTEIN_ is detected abaxial to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the two layers of cells located between the epidermis and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ marked provasculature . slightly _PROTEIN_ pfil dsred extends to the epidermis and into the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ domain . at _PROTEIN_ stages pfil dsred _PROTEIN_ almost entirely overlaps _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the primordium . to investigate this more thoroughly we covisualized pfil dsred prev _PROTEIN_ venus and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ together . we found that after pfil dsred _PROTEIN_ first expands both prev _PROTEIN_ venus and pfil dsred are coexpressed in a number of cells centered within the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ domain . these data confirm that both prev _PROTEIN_ venus and pfil dsred are initially _PROTEIN_ asymmetrically relative to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showing that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ marks a domain between abaxial and adaxial cell identities at primordial initiation . soon after as the _PROTEIN_ domains of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ expand into the anlagen their domains partially overlap during subsequent development . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gene encodes a transcription _PROTEIN_ involved in conferring floral meristem identity on primordia that develop from the inflorescence meristem . in lfy mutants secondary inflorescence _METHOD_ subtended by floral bracts frequently develop in the place of flowers . to understand where and when floral meristem identity is specified as marked by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ we examined the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ promoter driving _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized _METHOD_ in combination with pfil dsred . we detect the onset of plfy _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ approximately two plastochrons _PROTEIN_ than pfil dsred in a few adaxial cells abutting the pfil dsred _PROTEIN_ domain . by one plastochron _PROTEIN_ plfy _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ is much stronger and broader and this trend continues during _PROTEIN_ stages . plfy _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ is also sharply bounded on the adaxial side of the primordium by cells predicted to _PROTEIN_ the boundary marker _PROTEIN_ . if this were so we would expect a gap to form between the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domains at the time _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ initiates . visualization of and pfil dsred revealed that although the _PROTEIN_ of these markers initially abuts _PROTEIN_ during development a discernable gap in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ between their domains . this gap continues to expand during floral meristem development in a manner similar to the expansion of the plfy _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ pattern suggesting that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ initiates specifically in the region between the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domains and that the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domains move apart possibly through the proliferation of cells within the developing floral meristem . since prev _PROTEIN_ venus _PROTEIN_ also abuts pfil dsred _PROTEIN_ we examined prev _PROTEIN_ venus _PROTEIN_ during stage two of flower development and found that its _PROTEIN_ also spreads adaxially in a similar manner to plfy _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ . this is further correlated with an expansion of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . although pstm _PROTEIN_ venus _PROTEIN_ is still restricted to an adaxial boundary domain during early stage two of flower development before stage three pstm _PROTEIN_ venus _PROTEIN_ also expands rapidly . to summarize the _PROTEIN_ venus and pfil dsred _PROTEIN_ domains are located adjacent to each other with the boundary between these domains corresponding to the region where plfy _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ initiates . plfy _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ then expands as cells proliferate to form the flower meristem and this is correlated with an expansion of prev _PROTEIN_ venus and pstm _PROTEIN_ venus _PROTEIN_ into the primordium as well as an increase in primordial _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ .
the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion construct was made by inserting _METHOD_ into a unique xhoi site located in a bp genomic dna fragment obtained by pcr containing the _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ . this fragment was then transformed into plants heterozygous for the _PROTEIN_ mutation using the binary transformation vector . functionality was confirmed by identifying several families in which the wild type phenotype strictly cosegregated with the transgene . was constructed by first pcr amplifying both venus and a dna fragment encoding _LOCATION_ localization protein sequence with restriction sites and cloning them in frame to yield bamhi venus xbai _PROTEIN_ . the bamhi xbai fragment from _PROTEIN_ was then subcloned to to yield . separately venus was also pcr amplified and cloned to _PROTEIN_ topo flanked by bamhi and bglii sites . the bamhi bglii fragment from was then ligated to bamhi linearized and screened for clones with multiple insertions to yield . _PROTEIN_ was constructed by cloning the promoter upstream of the coding region and a noti fragment containing the reporter construct was then transferred to pmlbart and transformed into _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants . for constructing both the pstm _PROTEIN_ venus and prev _PROTEIN_ venus translational fusions a version of containing a alanine linker followed by venus was made . for _PROTEIN_ a full length _PROTEIN_ cdna was cloned and inserted in frame next to the alanine linker . a kb region of upstream regulatory sequence was then inserted upstream of the cdna . a noti fragment containing this reporter was cloned into pmlbart and transformed into _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ as described above . the ability of this construct to rescue the stm mutant phenotype has not been tested . prev _PROTEIN_ venus was constructed by amplifying a bp genomic dna fragment containing bp of sequence upstream of the _PROTEIN_ as well as the whole genomic coding region into containing alanine venus and transformed into landsberg _LOCATION_ plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and rev homozygous mutants . although the phenotype of transformed rev plants was variable many selected plants exhibited a wild type phenotype . we used a _PROTEIN_ promoter reporter consisting of kb of regulatory region fused to the reporter as described above . _PROTEIN_ venus was constructed by switching both the camv promoter for the kb _PROTEIN_ upstream regulatory sequence and venus for _METHOD_ in a previously reported _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct . subsequently a alanine linker was introduced as a translational fusion into the psti site between _PROTEIN_ and venus and transformed as described above . functionality of this fusion protein has not been tested . the pfil dsred marker was constructed by fusing dsred _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ localizing sequence as described for venus above . dna upstream of the _PROTEIN_ start was then cloned upstream of dsred in and transformed into _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants as described above . plfy _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ was made by amplifying a bp fragment upstream of the _PROTEIN_ coding region and inserting it upstream of the _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ coding region in the vector . for quantitative real time pcr analysis inflorescences were dissected and older flowers removed . the inflorescences were then submerged in either dimethylsulfoxide _METHOD_ or iaa dissolved in _METHOD_ . for treatment of _PROTEIN_ apices an auxin paste was applied made from mm iaa _METHOD_ in lanolin or a mock treatment of _METHOD_ in lanolin . for live imaging we found that _METHOD_ alone altered _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and so both iaa and naa were dissolved in m koh to make m iaa or naa stock which was then diluted to mm in h o . a m stock of npa dissolved in _METHOD_ was diluted in h o to give a treatment solution . approximately of solution was added to the meristem after each imaging session every hr . each treatment experiment was repeated at least three times with mock treatment controls . total rna was extracted using rnaeasy columns and subjected to on column dnase treatment according to the manufacturer s instructions . rna was then reverse transcribed using oligo dt and superscript ii rnase h reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer s instructions . the reaction mixture was diluted to and was used per real time pcr reaction . each primer pair was designed to cross introns in order to eliminate the possibility of genomic dna amplification . the primers for _PROTEIN_ were acaaaacgacgcaggctaag and _PROTEIN_ . we used both the and genes as internal controls by using the following primers that amplify both genes ggtaacattgtgctcagtggtgg and aacgaccttaatcttcatgctgc . each pcr reaction contained of sybr green pcr master kit containing hot start taq polymerase _METHOD_ of primers of cdna and of h for a reaction volume of . reactions were performed in triplicate on a geneamp thermocycler _METHOD_ . data was analyzed using the c t method . the amplification efficiencies for the and _PROTEIN_ primers were found to be approximately equal . the data were collected from three independent treatments and are _PROTEIN_ as a mean fold change and range in brackets corresponding to the mean c t _PROTEIN_ converted to a fold change value . inflorescence _METHOD_ were prepared for live imaging as described . l _LOCATION_ plants _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ markers were generated by transforming a chosen _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic line with all other markers . triple marker combinations were generated by crossing the double marker plants and screening the families . for high resolution images fixed stained tissue was prepared by applying ml to intact inflorescences . after min inflorescences were detached and fixed in paraformaldehyde containing tween and triton x at for hr . for whole mounts mature buds were dissected away and the meristem immersed in glycerol under a coverslip ready for imaging using a zeiss plan apochromat na objective . all imaging was done using a zeiss meta using a water dipping objective with the plant temporarily under water . for time lapse imaging of _METHOD_ alone we used a nm laser line together with a hft kp _PROTEIN_ dichroic and a nm long pass filter . the laser was attenuated to and we used s scans of a pixel frame . stacks of sections spaced approximately apart were collected every hr . in between imaging the water was decanted and the boxes containing the plants placed in a growth cabinet . non time lapse images of _METHOD_ alone were collected as above except we used a nm band pass filter and a higher laser setting and smaller pinhole . to image _METHOD_ and dsred together we used multitracking in line scan mode and a _PROTEIN_ dichroic . we used a secondary dichroic to split the emission in conjunction with a nm laser line and nm band pass filter for dsred and the nm laser line and a nm band pass filter for _METHOD_ . the conditions for imaging _METHOD_ combinations depended on the relative strengths of the markers . for strong venus with _METHOD_ both _METHOD_ proteins were excited using the nm laser line and the emission was separated using the meta spectral analyser . for weaker venus signal we used multitracking in frame mode . venus was excited using the nm laser line in conjunction with a band pass filter . _METHOD_ was excited with the nm laser line and collected using a secondary dichroic in conjunction with a band pass filter . for triple combinations of _METHOD_ venus and dsred we used frame multitracking . the settings were as for _METHOD_ multitracking except with an additional track for dsred using the nm laser line in conjunction with a secondary dichroic to separate the excitation light and band pass filter . images of five _METHOD_ were recorded prior to bleaching . then using the zeiss lsm software two regions of interest corresponding to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells located in incipient and older primordia were selected in each of the _METHOD_ . these regions were then continuously scanned using the nm laser line at power until signal could not be detected using the settings initially used for imaging the prebleached meristem . after allowing hr for recovery we reimaged the _METHOD_ to assess _METHOD_ recovery . visualization of volume renderings was performed using zeiss lsm software and amira _METHOD_ . at high resolution the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ could be assessed either by direct visualization or by analysis with image processing software specifically developed for this purpose . analysis of _METHOD_ imaged in this manner _METHOD_ that in general arcs of signal visible in approximately two thirds of meristem epidermal cells at lower resolution in projections corresponded to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein localization within cell corners as shown in citation . projections give a clearer indication of _PROTEIN_ subcellular _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the meristem compared to optical transverse sections because the viewing angle can be manipulated to be normal to the curved epidermal surface . the pattern of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ associated with different stages of primordium development shown in citation was representative of data gathered from greater than plants as assessed visually .
