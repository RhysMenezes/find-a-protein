several members of the yellow like family of transporter proteins are able to transport metal nicotianamine complexes . substantial progress has been made in understanding the roles of the arabidopsis ysls that are most closely related to the founding member of the family _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but there is little information concerning members of the other two well conserved ysl clades . here we provide evidence that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which are the only genes in arabidopsis belong to ysl group ii are localized to _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and to internal _LOCATION_ resembling _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . both single and double mutants for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were rigorously analyzed and have surprisingly mild phenotypes in spite of the strong and wide ranging _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . however in the presence of toxic levels of mn and ni plants with mutations in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and plants overexpressing _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ showed growth defects indicating a role for these transporters in heavy metal stress responses .
to understand the level of _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ relative to other members of the ysl family we performed quantitative rt pcr . _PROTEIN_ is strongly _PROTEIN_ in both shoots and roots and its mrna is present at levels similar to _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ mrna is _PROTEIN_ at lower levels and it is _PROTEIN_ at similar levels in both shoots and roots . because mrna levels for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in plants that have been grown under iron deficiency we examined the level of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrna in iron deficient plants . the mrna levels for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are not strongly affected by iron deficiency . semi quantitative rt pcr indicates that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrna levels are also not strongly affected by deficiency for other transition metals . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ by quantitative rt pcr . plants were grown on _METHOD_ medium for days and then transferred to _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ lacking iron for days . mrna levels were quantified in both shoots and roots . in order to determine the cell type specific _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we constructed _PROTEIN_ reporter constructs containing the promoter sequences of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ fused in frame to gus _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in germinating seedlings _PROTEIN_ gus was _PROTEIN_ strongly in roots and root hairs at h post germination by h _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ had spread to cotyledons where it remained strong at d post germination . only minimal _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ was detected in true leaves . _PROTEIN_ was also strong in flowers especially older flowers sepals and pollen . a cross section through a rosette leaf revealed that _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ was associated with xylem tissues . in rosette leaves _PROTEIN_ was low and diffuse in interveinal regions and in cauline leaves _PROTEIN_ was restricted to older areas of the leaf . in fruits _PROTEIN_ gus was _PROTEIN_ most strongly in the veins of the siliques with only weak _PROTEIN_ in the developing seeds . _PROTEIN_ was absent from roots at d . histochemical staining of _PROTEIN_ promoter gus reporter plants . seedling at h

compared to _PROTEIN_ gus plants and by and d _PROTEIN_ was evident in both cotyledons and true leaves . most of the cells in mature rosette leaves showed strong _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ including very strong staining in the vasculature . a rosette leaf cross section revealed that _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ was associated with xylem tissues . similar to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in the older regions of cauline leaves albeit more strongly than what was observed for _PROTEIN_ . however _PROTEIN_ was not as strongly _PROTEIN_ in sepals and anther filaments and _PROTEIN_ was not completely restricted to older flowers . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in young roots was more diffuse than _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ was more closely associated with the root vasculature . roots at d _PROTEIN_

to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a proteomics study of arabidopsis _LOCATION_ identified _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the tonoplast proteome _PROTEIN_ . to investigate this we used arabidopsis protoplasts to transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . when protoplasts were transformed with either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ tagged with _METHOD_ at the c terminus very few cells became labeled . indeed we were unable to observe _METHOD_ signals in the case of _PROTEIN_ . in the small number of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transformants identified we observed _METHOD_ label accumulating within the _LOCATION_ . based on these findings we tentatively concluded that end labeled _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were being abnormally processed and we constructed versions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ that contain _METHOD_ labels in non conserved regions within each protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . we then co transformed protoplasts with either _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in addition to _PROTEIN_ mcherry which served as a _LOCATION_ marker . in a separate experiment we stained protoplasts transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with fm to provide a marker for internal _LOCATION_ . it was evident that _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ localized to the tonoplast _LOCATION_ based on colocalization with _PROTEIN_ mcherry . additionally _PROTEIN_ also localized to the tonoplast _LOCATION_ based on colocalization with _PROTEIN_ mcherry and fm . subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts . each horizontal row of four images shows red _METHOD_ green _METHOD_ merged red and green images and differential interference contrast . top row protoplast co transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ mcherry . middle row protoplast co transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ mcherry . bottom row protoplast transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and stained with the _LOCATION_ selective dye fm . scale bar um . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct was also used to stably transform arabidopsis plants . the resulting transgenic plants were morphologically normal indicating that overexpression of this _LOCATION_ protein did not cause serious _METHOD_ with the endomembrane system . in the stable transformants the _METHOD_ signal was most readily observed in the guard cells notably not every cell contained _METHOD_ material in spite of the _PROTEIN_ that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct was driven by a constitutive promoter . most often the signal appeared as a bright spot in each guard cell that did not coincide with the chlorplasts . to identify the bright spots which are positioned similarly to guard cell _LOCATION_ we used dapi stain . from this analysis we observed that the green _METHOD_ was positioned around the _LOCATION_ in the guard cells . the signal is not coming from the _LOCATION_ envelope since often it does not completely surround the _LOCATION_ . probably the signal emanates from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ surrounding _LOCATION_ . another commonly observed pattern of _METHOD_ was more diffuse staining of internal membranous networks that may be _LOCATION_ . finally we often observed _METHOD_ in bright bodies similar to the small _LOCATION_ that we had observed in protoplasts . these bright bodies were observed in pavement cells in root cells and in root hairs consistent with our observations in transiently transformed protoplasts we never observed _METHOD_ associated with the large central _LOCATION_ in any cell . subcellular localization of

order to understand the in planta functions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we obtained mutant alleles from the salk collection of sequence indexed t dna insertions _PROTEIN_ . a single insertion line _PROTEIN_ was confirmed for _PROTEIN_ in which the t dna is inserted in the fifth exon . the line is annotated as an insertion into _PROTEIN_ but we were not able to amplify flanking sequences from this line and thus concluded that the line is likely mis annotated . two alleles were identified with t dna insertions in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . these insertions were in the first intron and last exon respectively . to determine whether these t dna insertions caused loss of function mutations rt pcr was performed on plants homozygous for each allele . no _PROTEIN_ mrna was detected in the leaves of _PROTEIN_ plants and no _PROTEIN_ mrna was detected in the leaves of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants although small amounts of contaminating gdna were detected in these samples . thus each of these t dna insertions appears to have caused a null mutation . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ null mutants . schematic representation of the structure of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . gray bars

_PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . results are given as ppm . _LOCATION_ bars represent standard _LOCATION_ . each sample contains replicates . asterisks indicate p < by t test . metal concentrations of leaves . metal concentrations of seeds . we determined the metal levels of each single mutant and the _PROTEIN_ double mutants using icp _METHOD_ . in leaves of plants grown in soil some statistically significant differences in metal levels were observed but these did not form a clear pattern . for example _PROTEIN_ mutants had elevated levels of mn and zn yet _PROTEIN_ mutants had no significant differences from wt col plants . homozygous _PROTEIN_ plants also had high mn and zn in leaves . interestingly however the _PROTEIN_ double mutant plants had normal levels of all four metals in leaves . in the seeds of the mutant plants more consistent changes in metal levels were observed . the _PROTEIN_ mutant seeds had elevated levels of zn and cu and a _PROTEIN_ level of fe . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant seeds had low fe and elevated cu . in the _PROTEIN_ double mutant seeds zn and cu were higher than normal similar to the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutants . however fe levels in the seeds of the _PROTEIN_ double mutants were not significantly different from wt col despite the single mutants low seed fe . the double mutants had elevated mn levels which were also not observed in any of the single mutants . the altered metal accumulation phenotypes observed in these mutants suggest that as expected _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ play roles in metal ion homeostasis in arabidopsis . no obvious growth defects were noted in the single mutants when grown in soil or on _METHOD_ agar plates so we identified double mutants that were homozygous for both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . like the single mutants the _PROTEIN_ double mutants had no obvious growth defects when grown in soil or on _METHOD_ agar plates . we then tested for differential tolerance or sensitivity to metal deficiency in plants either germinated directly on plates lacking fe cu mn or zn or in seedlings germinated on plates with normal nutrients and then transferred to plates lacking one metal . no differences in growth or appearance were identified . germination response to metal deficiency . seeds of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or the _PROTEIN_ double mutant were germinated on complete _METHOD_ medium or _METHOD_ medium lacking fe zn cu or mn . germination was scored every h. three replicates of seeds each were scored . _LOCATION_ bars indicate standard _LOCATION_ of the mean . metal starvation response in seedlings of col _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . seedlings were grown on _METHOD_ medium lacking fe for days and then chlorophyll levels were measured . chlorophyll levels of col and _PROTEIN_ . chlorophyll levels of col and _PROTEIN_ . chlorophyll levels of col and _PROTEIN_ . chlorophyll levels of col and _PROTEIN_ . plants were grown on _METHOD_ plates for days and then transferred to _METHOD_ without fe zn cu or mn for days . the total chlorophyll content of the shoot system was measured . chlorophyll levels of plants grown on _METHOD_ medium lacking fe . chlorophyll levels of plants grown on _METHOD_ medium lacking zn . chlorophyll levels of plants grown on _METHOD_ medium lacking cu . chlorophyll levels of plants grown on _METHOD_ medium lacking mn . we next examined whether _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants were differentially affected by high levels of iron in the growth medium . seeds were plated directly onto medium containing either no additional fe fe citrate or na citrate . our initial experiment indicated that although single mutants were not affected _PROTEIN_ double mutants were more sensitive to fe citrate based on chlorosis and smaller seedling size . this is finding is consistent with the results presented recently by divol et al . _PROTEIN_ . however we discovered that the addition of fe citrate caused the ph of the medium to _PROTEIN_ from . we thus set up an additional experiment in which we buffered the growth medium such that plates containing fe citrate remained at ph . after weeks of growth we did not observe any differences in seedling appearance on these plates and there were no measurable differences in chlorophyll content . thus without the lowered ph brought about by the inclusion of high concentrations of fe citrate in the medium the double mutant plants were not unusually sensitive to excess fe . response of col _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to fe citrate excess . plants were grown vertically for two weeks on medium containing either mm na citrate or mm fecitrate prior to photographing . plants were grown for weeks on regular _METHOD_ medium before measuring chlorophyll content . plants were grown for weeks on _METHOD_ medium containing mm nacitrate before measuring chlorophyll content . plants were grown for weeks on _METHOD_ medium that was adjusted to ph after addition of mm fe citrate . chlorophyll content was measured as in . for chlorophyll content of three batches of seedlings was measured and averaged . _LOCATION_ bars indicate . because altered seed metal levels were observed using icp _METHOD_ we examined whether metals were also mis localized in the seeds of the mutants . we used synchrotron x ray _METHOD_ microtomography to visualize metals directly in the seeds of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the double mutant _PROTEIN_ . fe localizes to the provascular strands of the hypocotyl radicle and cotyledons mn to the abaxial epidermis of the cotyledons and zn and cu localize throughout the embryo in a diffuse pattern _PROTEIN_ . the patterns of metal localization in the single and double mutants were unaltered indicating that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are not required for proper localization of metals in arabidopsis seeds even though the levels of these metals are altered in the mutants . synchrotron x ray _METHOD_ computed microtomography showing the distribution of fe mn zn and cu in col and ysl mutant lines . _METHOD_ were collected via sxrf computed microtomography from intact dry arabidopsis seed . all seeds are oriented with the radicle at left and cotyledons at right . it has been established that loss of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ causes altered metal accumulation in the seeds . because the weak phenotypes of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants were difficult to interpret we constructed double mutants of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . previously we have shown that _PROTEIN_ double mutants have severe developmental defects that include chlorosis male infertility impaired or aborted seed development and altered levels of metals in both vegetative structures and seeds . single _PROTEIN_ mutants have mild phenotypes that include low iron in seeds and elevated na levels while single _PROTEIN_ mutants are not distinguishable from wt plants . neither _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ nor _PROTEIN_ plants displayed strong phenotypes either on soil or _METHOD_ agar plates . plants had normal chlorophyll levels and normal fertility . additionally metal localization was not disrupted in either the _PROTEIN_ or the _PROTEIN_ double mutant lines based on sxfm experiments . recently sasaki et al . uncovered a mn sensitivity phenotype in rice knockout lines . this finding prompted us to examine _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants for manganese sensitivity phenotypes . after days of growth we measured the fresh weights of mutant and wild type plants grown on _METHOD_ agar plates containing and mm additional mn . we found that at mm additional mn _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ double mutants had significant _PROTEIN_ in fresh weight compared to col . at mm additional mn all plants were severely affected with only _PROTEIN_ showing a significantly lower fresh weight compared to col . when the plants grown for an additional weeks on _METHOD_ plates supplemented with mm mn the double mutant plants became green and grew larger than either single mutants or wt . double mutant plants transformed with the _METHOD_ construct did not show growth recovery but remained small and yellow on mm mn . since the _METHOD_ construct restores a wt phenotype it appears to be functional in vivo . manganese sensitivity of ysl mutants . seeds of col _PROTEIN_ double mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutants were sown onto _METHOD_ medium containing either or mm excess and grown for days . fresh weights were measured by weighing batches of seedlings each . weights are _PROTEIN_ as a percentage of the weights of seedlings grown under the control condition _METHOD_ . n batches of seedlings . p and > p . prolonged growth of mutants and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ oe complemented mutants on excess mn . seeds of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutants _PROTEIN_ double mutants and two independent lines of _PROTEIN_ double mutants transformed with a construct over _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were sown onto _METHOD_ medium containing mm excess and grown for days . we also measured the rate of root growth in early seedlings exposed to mm as well as um and um to see whether mutation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ or over _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ would affect the plants ability to grow in the presence of toxic levels of these metals . to force the plants to take up excess mn zn or ni we included plates that were prepared with no iron . under these iron deficient conditions plants are expected to up regulate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which leads to increase uptake of iron and of other _PROTEIN_ substrates like mn ni and zn . growth of mutants and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ oe plants on excess metals . root growth rate during the h period between h and h post germination is presented . photographs of the plates were taken every h and used to determine the growth rate for each h period . plants were germinated and grown vertically on plates containing . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ mm _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ without added iron _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ without added iron and with mm _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ without added iron and with um _METHOD_ . p . one of the two lines of plants overexpressing _METHOD_ had an increased root growth rate on _METHOD_ medium . on _METHOD_ containing added mn there was a trend of _PROTEIN_ root growth rate for the _METHOD_ plants but no trends or significant differences were noted on _METHOD_ containing added ni . when iron was withdrawn from the medium however both mutants and over _PROTEIN_ plants showed marked changes in root growth rates . in the presence of either mn or ni the _PROTEIN_ mutants and the _PROTEIN_ double mutants had increased root growth rates while _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overexpressing plants had _PROTEIN_ root growth rates . we did not observe any significant differences in the growth rates of mutant or over _PROTEIN_ plants exposed to um zn . we tested transporter activity of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ using yeast functional complementation assays but neither protein could alleviate the iron limited growth defect of yeast . because successful complementation will only occur if heterologous proteins are _PROTEIN_ on the yeast _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ it is reasonable that _LOCATION_ proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ would not correct the growth defect . indeed which belongs to the same group as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and was shown to localize to vesicles in barley cells was unable to complement yeast in the presence of mm fe na . the use of other transport assay _METHOD_ will be required in order to characterize the transport activity of these proteins . neither _PROTEIN_ nor _PROTEIN_ is able to complement . these experiments were performed as described . yeast transformed with pgev and empty vector or constructs containing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were plated onto sd trp medium containing mm fe citrate mm iron nm beta estradiol mm nm be mm fe na complex nm be or mm fe na complex without be . pairs of spots correspond to and fold dilutions of the original cultures . plates were photographed after days of growth .
seeds were sterilized in eppendorf tubes or a ml falcon tube depending on the quantity and suspected level of contamination of the seeds . seeds were soaked in ethanol and triton x for min with occasional vortexing then three times with ethanol . seeds were gently placed onto sterile whatman paper and allowed to dry . they were then either imbibed in sterile agarose at for days or were plated wrapped in foil and stored at for days prior to transfer to the growth chamber plants were grown on sterile _METHOD_ agar medium with or without antibiotics . plates were placed in an upright position so that the roots grew along the surface rather than inside the agar which allowed for easy transfer . plates were placed in an incubator at with h of light and h of darkness . seeds imbibed in distilled water at in the dark for days and then were sown directly onto metro mix treated with gnatrol to control fungus gnats . growth chamber conditions were the same as for plate grown plants . plant parts were ground in ml tubes using rnase free disposable pestles . total rna was isolated using the rneasy plant mini kit followed by dnase treatment using the dna free kit . the total rna concentration was quantified using a spectrophotometer and confirmation of rna quality was performed by visualization on a tbe gel stained with ethidium bromide . rna isolation and rt reactions were performed as described . quantitative real time pcr was also performed as described . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ specific primer sequences were as follows for _PROTEIN_ fw and rev for _PROTEIN_ fw and rev _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ promoter region containing bp upstream of the _PROTEIN_ initiating _PROTEIN_ was cloned to create a c terminal translational fusion to the gus reporter gene . the _PROTEIN_ promoter region containing bp upstream of the _PROTEIN_ initiating _PROTEIN_ was cloned to create a c terminal translational fusion to the gus reporter gene . the _PROTEIN_ gus and _PROTEIN_ gus constructs were then stably introduced into arabidopsis using the floral dip method . seeds were germinated on _METHOD_ medium with kanamycin to select for transformants and seedlings were transferred to soil days after germination . for soil grown plants leaf samples were collected days after sowing and dried in an oven at . icp _METHOD_ was performed as described previously . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cdnas were amplified by rt pcr using platinum taq dna polymerase high fidelity . _PROTEIN_ cdna was amplified using the primers tctgagagtgagaggaatcactgaaaa and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ cdna was amplified using the primers _PROTEIN_ and ctctctcttgctgaggacggtccaaa . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cdna were then cloned into the gateway vector . using the megaprimer method _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was incorporated into _PROTEIN_ between position and in the cdna and _PROTEIN_ between position and in the cdna . based on protein structure predictions these positions correspond to _LOCATION_ loops that are weakly conserved among ysls . the primers gcaacaaaagctccagacaagggatccaaggagatataacaatga and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and caatctacccattgttaccgacgggatccaaggagatataacaatga and gaagcttcactgtcatctacacctttgtatagttcatccatgccat _PROTEIN_ were used to amplify the plasmid _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to create megaprimers containing the _METHOD_ sequence flanked by specific ysl sequences . these megaprimers were gel purified and used in a modified site directed mutagenesis protocol to introduce the _METHOD_ sequence into the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ clones described above . this was accomplished using ng of purified megaprimers ng of target vector _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mm dntp mix phusion hf buffer of phusion enzyme and the following pcr conditions an initial denaturation at for min followed by cycles of for s for s and for min followed by a final elongation of for min . after dpni digestion to remove the methylated parent plasmid ml of each reaction was used to transform _PROTEIN_ chemically competent e. coli . positive clones were verified by restriction digestion and sequencing to ensure incorporation of the full _METHOD_ sequence . an lr recombination reaction was then performed to transfer _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ into the vector _PROTEIN_ for subsequent transient _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts in addition to stable _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis plants . protoplasts were isolated using the tape arabidopsis sandwich method . transformations were carried out using protoplasts in of mmg solution mixed with of plasmid dna at room temperature . an equal volume of freshly prepared transformation solution was added and allowed to incubate for min . protoplasts were then carefully washed three times with modified solution _PROTEIN_ resuspended in modified and incubated at room temperature in dishes for to h. _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in was co transformed with which is available from tair and contains _PROTEIN_ fused to mcherry . the lipophilic dye fm was applied to transformed protoplasts at a final concentration of for min on ice . the dye was then washed off and protoplasts were incubated at rt for h to allow the dye to penetrate the cells prior to confocal imaging . all constructs to be used in plant transformation experiments were transferred to agrobacterium tumefaciens via electroporation . arabidopsis thaliana plants were transformed by agrobacterium mediated transformation using the floral dip method . primary transformants were selected by spraying with the herbicide finale . individual progeny of selfed primary transformants were examined by confocal microscopy . protoplasts were imaged using a zeiss lsm meta confocal system equipped with a oil immersion objective . an argon nm laser was used for excitation of _METHOD_ and a hene laser was used for excitation of fm and mcherry . emission of _METHOD_ was collected between and nm and emission of fm and mcherry was collected between and nm . seeds were plated directly onto medium containing phytoagar and imbibed for h at in the dark . plates were then transferred into the growth chamber and allowed to grow vertically . photographs of the plates were taken every h and successive images were aligned using imagej . the difference in root length over successive h periods was recorded and used to calculate the root growth rate in mm/h .
