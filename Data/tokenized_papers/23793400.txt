the secretory pathway is responsible for the transport of newly synthesized transmembrane proteins from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to their destinations via the _LOCATION_ trans _LOCATION_ network . cargo proteins at each station are actively sorted by specific sorting signals on the cargo and the corresponding coat complexes . here we used the arabidopsis regulator of g protein signaling _PROTEIN_ which contains an n terminal potentially sensing _PROTEIN_ seven transmembrane domain and a c terminal rgs domain as a model to uncover sorting motifs required for its cell surface _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ of wild type and truncated or mutated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins identified two cysteine residues in the _LOCATION_ n terminus that are essential for _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ exit and/or correct folding of _PROTEIN_ . the linker between the seven transmembrane and rgs domains contains an _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ export signal whereas the c terminus is dispensable for the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . interestingly deletion of the rgs domain results in _LOCATION_ localization of the truncated _PROTEIN_ . further analysis using site directed mutagenesis showed that a tyrosine based motif embedded in the rgs domain is essential for _LOCATION_ export of _PROTEIN_ . these results reveal a new role for the rgs domain in regulating _PROTEIN_ trafficking from the _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and explain the interaction between the seven transmembrane and rgs domains .
to systematically examine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ in plant cells we constructed transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which is able to complement the null mutant _PROTEIN_ . because overexpression may cause mislocalization of a fusion protein we used transgenic plants to ensure that _PROTEIN_ of fusion proteins and their subcellular localization are stable in our experiments . we did not observe mislocalization of the fusion proteins due to overexpression using _METHOD_ microscopy . subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was carefully examined in various types of cells together with transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ an _LOCATION_ marker _METHOD_ and a _LOCATION_ marker _METHOD_ . in pavement and hypocotyl epidermal cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was evenly distributed in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ while _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ markers were localized to punctate structures that are closely attached to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ due to the central _LOCATION_ which physically forces the structures near the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in these cells . however the structural difference in _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ markers was observed in root cells and guard cells . in these cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was clearly distributed in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as well as in endosomes . the _LOCATION_ marker displayed a perinuclear and a reticulate cortical _PROTEIN_ pattern while the _LOCATION_ marker formed a pattern of minute clusters . the different morphologies of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in root and guard cells provided a format in which we could clearly determine the subcellular localization of _METHOD_ fused truncations and point mutations of _PROTEIN_ in the following studies . to better describe the characteristics of the _PROTEIN_ sequence we divided full length _PROTEIN_ which is composed of amino acids into five segments a short _LOCATION_ n terminus a tm domain a linker between the tm and rgs domains an rgs domain and a cytoplasmic c terminus . to identify essential motifs for _PROTEIN_ trafficking from the _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ we made a fusion construct consisting of the tm domain of _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ designated atrgs _METHOD_ and transformed it into arabidopsis plants . confocal microscopy analysis of root cells of the resulting transgenic plants showed that atrgs _METHOD_ was primarily localized in the _LOCATION_ . this _METHOD_ pattern is quite similar to that of sp _METHOD_ hdel a widely used _LOCATION_ marker . confocal microscopy analysis of the root cells stained with the dna probe diamidino phenylindole demonstrated that green _METHOD_ surrounded the blue circle that was formed via dapi binding to dna . to exclude the possibility that atrgs _METHOD_ might be partially localized to the _LOCATION_ and/or _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ the transgenic plants were treated with brefeldin a a fungus derived macrocyclic lactone that can block the recycling pathway of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins and thus lead to the formation of bfa compartments . it is well established that the _LOCATION_ and early endosomes are sensitive to bfa . as shown in a h treatment of bfa resulted in accumulation of the _LOCATION_ maker _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the bfa compartments . however little effect of bfa on the _METHOD_ pattern of atrgs _METHOD_ and sp _METHOD_ hdel was observed . these results suggest that the tm domain of _PROTEIN_ lacks an _LOCATION_ export motif . the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ contains two cysteine residues _PROTEIN_ which are predicted to form a disulphide bond in _PROTEIN_ . to investigate the role of the n terminus and the two cysteine residues in trafficking of _PROTEIN_ we generated several mutant _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs that either lack the n terminal amino acids _PROTEIN_ or contain one or two cys gly mutations _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and transformed each construct into arabidopsis plants . confocal microscopy analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized to the _LOCATION_ in root and guard cells indicating that the n terminus is required for _LOCATION_ export . likewise both the single _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and double _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ cysteine mutations led to the retention of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ suggesting that the two cysteine residues play a crucial role in _LOCATION_ export of _PROTEIN_ . in contrast mutations of another pair of cysteines and _PROTEIN_ which are also predicted to form a potential disulfide bond had no effect on _PROTEIN_ subcellular localization . thus we conclude that the disulfide bond formed at the n terminus is vital for _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ at the cell surface . to identify the sorting signals required for the cell surface _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ we transformed three constructs encoding truncated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ into the wild type arabidopsis plants . confocal microscopy analysis showed that while _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were localized in the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized to _LOCATION_ punctates that resemble the _LOCATION_ . to confirm the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ we crossed the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic line with a well characterized tgn marker line _PROTEIN_ vha _METHOD_ . as expected _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ largely co localized with vha _METHOD_ . in addition _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was transiently co _PROTEIN_ with the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in tobacco epidermal cells . _METHOD_ imaging results showed some of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labeled particles partially overlapped _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is slightly localized to the _LOCATION_ . furthermore the transgenic seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were treated with a general _METHOD_ marker of endocytosis . as shown in many of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labeled vesicles were co localized with the stained _LOCATION_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is _PROTEIN_ localized in the tgn on the secretory pathway . taken together these results suggest that the linker of _PROTEIN_ contains the _LOCATION_ export signal . the dileucine motifs in the _LOCATION_ proximal c terminus of _PROTEIN_ have been demonstrated to function as sorting signals for _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ exports . we found that there are two ll motifs in the linker sequence of _PROTEIN_ . to examine their roles in _LOCATION_ export we mutated either or both of the ll motifs into alanines . the resulting transgenes _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were transformed into arabidopsis plants while _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco epidermal cells . unexpectedly _METHOD_ imaging of the transgenic cells showed that all of the fusion proteins were localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . these data indicate that the two ll motifs located in the linker are not critical for the _LOCATION_ export of _PROTEIN_ . to identify a likely _LOCATION_ export motif we made four constructs _PROTEIN_ truncated _PROTEIN_ proteins with partial deletion of the linker designated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and transformed them into arabidopsis plants . confocal microscopy analysis of the transgenic plants showed that while _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized to the _LOCATION_ all of the other truncated fusion proteins were only observed in the _LOCATION_ . these results suggest that the _LOCATION_ export signal is likely located in the latter portion of the linker . our results showed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is _PROTEIN_ localized in the tgn . to identify the tgn export signal we _PROTEIN_ two truncated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins lacking the c terminus _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or the rgs domain _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in arabidopsis plants . _METHOD_ imaging demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and endosomes while _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was in the tgn . these results suggest that the sorting signal required for tgn export of _PROTEIN_ is located in the rgs domain . to map the tgn export motif we _PROTEIN_ a series of _METHOD_ fusions of _PROTEIN_ carrying a truncated rgs domain designated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in arabidopsis plants . our results showed that all four truncated proteins were localized to the _LOCATION_ rather than in the tgn suggesting that these truncated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins are likely misfolded and retained in the _LOCATION_ by the _LOCATION_ protein quality control system . when these transgenic plant cells were treated with bfa we found that root cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ formed bfa bodies but no bfa bodies were detected in the transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the other three fusion constructs . we observed that the punctates labeled with atrgs _METHOD_ were also sensitive to bfa . morphological comparison revealed that the bfa bodies formed in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic cells were filled with _METHOD_ while the bfa bodies in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic cells displayed a doughnut like _PROTEIN_ structure with punctate _METHOD_ staining inside . taken together these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ may contain tgn export signals . because cargo proteins at the tgn are sorted by _PROTEIN_ proteins which often recognize the tyrosine based motif of the cargo proteins we assumed that a similar motif was present in the rgs domain . there are three tyrosine residues at positions and within the fragment of the rgs domain . to determine tgn sorting signals in the rgs domain we individually mutated and to alanines . subcellular localization analysis showed that both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ displayed the same _PROTEIN_ pattern as _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ whereas the mutation resulted in significant retention of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the tgn . this result was confirmed by the partial co localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . thus we conclude that the based motif functions as a tgn export signal for _PROTEIN_ . the tgn is _PROTEIN_ as an early endosome merging the secretory and endocytic pathways in plant cells . the different subcellular localizations of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ provided an opportunity to study whether or not the early endosome and tgn are merged in the _PROTEIN_ protein trafficking system . to investigate this we crossed the transgenic line _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . as previously observed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was distributed in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as well as endosomes whereas _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized to the tgn . in the merged _METHOD_ image the _METHOD_ labeled endosome did not overlap with the _METHOD_ labeled tgn . to further demonstrate this the transgenic plants co _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were treated with bfa to which both _METHOD_ labeled proteins are sensitive . the resulting _METHOD_ signals revealed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at the center of bfa bodies whereas _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was detected surrounding the bfa bodies . taken together these data indicate that the _PROTEIN_ labeled endosome is distinct from the _PROTEIN_ labeled tgn .
