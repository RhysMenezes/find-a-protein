forward genetics approaches have helped elucidate the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway in plants . here we used the arabidopsis banyuls mutant which accumulates anthocyanins instead of colorless proanthocyanidin precursors in immature seeds . in contrast to standard screens for mutants lacking anthocyanins in _METHOD_ we mutagenized ban plants and screened for mutants showing differences in pigmentation of immature seeds . the pale _PROTEIN_ mutation caused reduced anthocyanin pigmentation in immature seeds compared with ban . immature _PROTEIN_ ban seeds contained less anthocyanins and flavonols than ban but showed normal _PROTEIN_ of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes . in contrast to _PROTEIN_ introduction of a flavonol less mutation into ban did not produce paler immature seeds . map based cloning showed that two independent _PROTEIN_ alleles disrupted the mate type transporter gene _PROTEIN_ . complementation of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ confirmed that mutation in _PROTEIN_ causes the _PROTEIN_ phenotype . during development _PROTEIN_ promoter activity was detected in the seed coat layers that accumulate flavonoids . anthocyanins accumulate in the _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localized in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . heterologous _PROTEIN_ of grapevine mate type anthocyanin transporter gene partially complemented the _PROTEIN_ phenotype . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ acts at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in anthocyanin accumulation in the arabidopsis seed coat and that our screening strategy can reveal anthocyanin related genes that have not been found by standard screening .
dry seeds of ban were mutagenized using _PROTEIN_ ion _METHOD_ as described shikazono et al . . screening for immature seeds that showed altered anthocyanin levels compared to parental ban identified candidate mutant lines with a paler immature seed color phenotype . one of these _PROTEIN_ was characterized in this study . because the _PROTEIN_ phenotype was only detected in the ban background hereafter we referred to this mutant as _PROTEIN_ ban . as shown in fig . the _PROTEIN_ ban mutants showed obvious pale anthocyanin pigmentation at _PROTEIN_ . backcrossing of _PROTEIN_ ban with the parental ban suggested that the _PROTEIN_ mutation is recessive . we used hplc to determine the flavonoid composition of immature seeds of _PROTEIN_ ban plants . in extracts of immature seeds from the parental ban plants we observed one major peak in the absorbance at nm . comparison with the hplc pattern of commercial standard cyanidin _PROTEIN_ showed the same retention time as the peak in ban demonstrating that ban immature seeds contain as a major anthocyanin . by contrast we found remarkable reduction of the peak of in extracts from the _PROTEIN_ ban mutants suggesting that levels were reduced in _PROTEIN_ ban immature seeds . for flavonols we detected two strong peaks in extracts of immature ban seeds . the same peak pattern was confirmed with col immature seed extracts . the flavonoid profile of col immature seeds was recently reported . according to that report the two major peaks in ban were likely to be quercetin rhamnoside hexosides and quercetin o rhamnosides . the latter peak overlapped with a peak of the standard compound quercetin o rhamnoside . in _PROTEIN_ ban compared with ban both of these major peaks were lower and one minor peak with a retention time of min was newly detected . to address the reason for the _PROTEIN_ amounts of flavonoids in _PROTEIN_ ban immature seeds we used rt pcr to examine the _PROTEIN_ of flavonoid biosynthetic genes in immature seeds of _PROTEIN_ ban and parental ban plants . we focused on eight genes . these included four that function in both anthocyanin and flavonol biosynthesis _PROTEIN_ synthase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ isomerase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ hydroxylase _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ hydroxylase . we also examined a flavonol specific gene _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and three anthocyanin specific genes dihydroflavonol reductase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ dioxygenase _PROTEIN_ and glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ . as shown in fig . the _PROTEIN_ ban and ban plants showed no significant difference in _PROTEIN_ levels of the eight genes . these results suggested that the reduction in anthocyanin and flavonol contents was not due to a reduction of _PROTEIN_ of their biosynthetic genes . flavonols can act as co pigments in planta by stabilizing anthocyanin containing macromolecules . to test whether the reduction of flavonol contents triggers the paler pigmentation phenotype in _PROTEIN_ ban immature seeds we introduced a mutation in the flavonol biosynthetic pathway into the ban background by crossing flavonol _PROTEIN_ with ban and compared the immature seeds of _PROTEIN_ ban and ban siblings . the _PROTEIN_ ban double mutant did not show a paler phenotype than ban . this result suggested that the pale coloration of _PROTEIN_ ban immature seeds was caused directly by _PROTEIN_ accumulation of anthocyanins but not flavonols . we next used map based cloning to identify the gene responsible for the _PROTEIN_ ban phenotype using a mapping population from crosses of _PROTEIN_ ban with ban . chromosome walking and sequencing analysis demonstrated that an approximately kb deletion occurred in the middle of chromosome of the _PROTEIN_ allele . this deleted region was found to contain annotated genes _GENE_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ . the orfs of _GENE_ and _GENE_ were interrupted by deletion boundaries whereas the orfs of and _GENE_ were completely deleted . one of the genes _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ encodes a multidrug and toxin extrusion type transporter protein previously implicated in flavonol accumulation although its involvement in anthocyanin accumulation was unclear . focusing our attention on this gene _PROTEIN_ we attempted to determine whether _PROTEIN_ is responsible for the _PROTEIN_ ban phenotype . first we tested whether an fft mutant could affect the ban phenotype by crossing the t dna insertion line fft with ban to construct a double mutant line . immature seeds of the double mutant were obviously paler than ban . second further screening in our mutant population identified another _PROTEIN_ mutant allele _PROTEIN_ which possessed a nonsense mutation in _PROTEIN_ resulting in a truncated _PROTEIN_ protein . third introduction of an approximately kb genomic region encompassing the _PROTEIN_ promoter and orf into the _PROTEIN_ ban mutant complemented the paler anthocyanin phenotype in immature seeds . these results demonstrated that mutation in _PROTEIN_ is responsible for the reduced level of anthocyanins in _PROTEIN_ ban immature seeds . base on the results two mutated genes isolated in this study _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were named as alleles of fft such as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the arabidopsis seed coat consists of three inner and two outer integument layers . in ban anthocyanins accumulate in the innermost layer of the inner integument layers . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in the endothelium we _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter . to this end an approximately kb genomic region immediately upstream of the _PROTEIN_ start codon was recovered as a promoter fragment and cloned into a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ vector . the resultant construct profft _METHOD_ was introduced into col and transformants were isolated on plates containing the appropriate antibiotics . focusing on immature seed development we found _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in seed coats . at the immature seed stage _PROTEIN_ promoter activity was detected in the endothelium of several independent transformants . additionally _PROTEIN_ promoter activity was detected in two outer integument layers . of the two outer integument layers the inner layer accumulates flavonols while the outer layer accumulates seed mucilage . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the layer could be related to the _PROTEIN_ seed mucilage found in fft mature seeds . the arabidopsis information resource database documents two types of _PROTEIN_ mrna which differ in length due to different splicing patterns . to determine which type of _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in immature seeds full length _PROTEIN_ cdnas were isolated from immature seeds of col and ban at _PROTEIN_ . only the shorter _PROTEIN_ cdna was detected in immature seeds of col and ban and we used this cdna for further analysis . to determine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ proteins _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ as fusions with the n or c terminus of _METHOD_ under the control of the promoter _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the _PROTEIN_ ban mutants were transformed with these constructs . most of the transformants showed higher levels of anthocyanins in immature seeds compared with _PROTEIN_ ban indicating that both fusion proteins are functional in planta . initial attempts to identify the precise subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ in immature seed coats of the transformants were problematic due to weak _METHOD_ and the depth of the target cells . therefore we observed root and hypocotyl cells of the transformants at the seedling stage . as shown in fig . c _PROTEIN_ localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in the meristematic root cells and sub epidermal cells of the hypocotyls . furthermore we confirmed similar localization patterns of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis cultured cell lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . these _METHOD_ patterns were the same _PROTEIN_ of the position of _METHOD_ in the fusion protein . previously mate type transporter genes from grapevine _GENE_ and were reported to be localized to _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ for functioning as anthocyanin transporters . in order to address the function of _PROTEIN_ we carried out the complementation test as to whether could rescue _PROTEIN_ phenotype . seven independent transformants were obtained in a _PROTEIN_ ban background under the growth in antibiotics containing media . based on the immature seed phenotypes at _PROTEIN_ the transformants were divided into two groups three lines were partially rescued whereas the remaining four lines were not rescued from _PROTEIN_ ban phenotype . rt pcr using young siliques rna for four independent transformants suggested that as shown in fig . was _PROTEIN_ in young siliques of group s members but less or not in those of group s members . then to know the relationship between _PROTEIN_ and anthocyanin accumulation quantitative analysis of anthocyanins was performed using immature seeds of five representative lines of transformants . the results indicated that the contents in extracts from members of group were indistinguishable from _PROTEIN_ ban . on the other hand the contents in extracts from members of group were significantly higher than those of group . these results suggested that could exhibit the complementary role to _PROTEIN_ in planta . considering the contents in extracts of ban the effect of on anthocyanin accumulation was somewhat limited . the limited effect might be explained by substrate preference of acylated anthocyanins are the best substrates whereas _PROTEIN_ anthcyanins such as are poorly transported . in ban seeds disruption of the first enzyme in the _PROTEIN_ specific route anthocyanidin reductase _PROTEIN_ changes the metabolic flow from a _PROTEIN_ producing to an anthocyanin producing route thus causing anthocyanin accumulation . we hypothesized that the _PROTEIN_ ban phenotype derives from a lack of functional _PROTEIN_ in the endothelium and thus we next investigated the contribution of _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ accumulation . _PROTEIN_ accumulation levels generally correspond to the levels of brown color in mature arabidopsis seeds . at the mature stage the seed color of fft was indistinguishable from col . we also examined _PROTEIN_ accumulation at the immature seed stage with vanillin which reacts with monomers of _PROTEIN_ precursors and terminal units of _PROTEIN_ to produce red colored products . vanillin staining indicated that fft mutants and col had similar _PROTEIN_ accumulation in immature seeds . these results suggested that mutation in _PROTEIN_ has little effect on _PROTEIN_ accumulation . previous work showed that _PROTEIN_ operates in the endothelium of arabidopsis immature seeds and plays a role in _PROTEIN_ accumulation . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ is involved in the anthocyanin accumulation in ban endothelium we crossed the _PROTEIN_ mutation with ban and examined the immature seeds . in the _PROTEIN_ ban double mutant immature seeds _PROTEIN_ showed a similar phenotype to ban . double mutants with different alleles of ban _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed similar phenotypes . based on these results _PROTEIN_ could have a different role from _PROTEIN_ in flavonoid accumulation in the seed coat .
