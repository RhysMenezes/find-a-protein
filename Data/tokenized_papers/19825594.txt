four members of the tandem pore potassium channel family of arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ reside in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ whereas _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ k channel . by constructing chimeras between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we attempted to identify channel domains involved in the trafficking process and found that the _PROTEIN_ cytoplasmic c terminal domain is critical for the _LOCATION_ as well as _LOCATION_ sorting steps . following site directed mutagenesis we identified a diacidic motif required for _LOCATION_ export of _PROTEIN_ . however this diacidic motif in the c terminus is not conserved among other members of the tpk family and _PROTEIN_ sorting is independent of its ct . moreover the binding site of _PROTEIN_ essential for channel activation is not involved in channel sorting .
the arabidopsis potassium channel _PROTEIN_ localizes to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _LOCATION_ targeting of _PROTEIN_ might rely on _LOCATION_ dependent sorting steps or as reported for the psv trafficking of _PROTEIN_ could occur along a _LOCATION_ independent route . to distinguish between these routes we applied the fungal toxin brefeldin a which inhibits secretion and causes redistribution of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . under control conditions in cells co _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the absence of brefeldin a _PROTEIN_ channels were observed at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ while _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ exhibited _LOCATION_ staining . upon incubation with brefeldin a the _LOCATION_ marker redistributed into an _LOCATION_ like compartment throughout the cell . similarly _LOCATION_ apparatus disruption prevented _LOCATION_ trafficking of _PROTEIN_ resulting in co localization with the _LOCATION_ marker . this indicates that _LOCATION_ targeting of _PROTEIN_ occurs via _LOCATION_ dependent sorting machinery . the animal tpk channel possesses a binding and a basic motif which are involved in _LOCATION_ release and surface _PROTEIN_ of this _LOCATION_ protein . similar motifs are found in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ both of which are located in close proximity within the cytoplasmic n terminus . to test whether mediated _LOCATION_ release might represent a mechanism allowing forward trafficking of _PROTEIN_ in planta we silenced the respective phosphorylation site within the _PROTEIN_ binding motif . mutating ser to alanine _PROTEIN_ prevented binding in vitro but not _LOCATION_ targeting of _PROTEIN_ . likewise mimicking phosphorylation by exchanging ser for glutamate _PROTEIN_ did not affect _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ . thus binding which regulates channel gating _METHOD_ not to be involved in targeting of _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ . the generation of chimeras between structurally and functionally related proteins exhibiting different sub cellular localization has been used to study molecular determinants important for trafficking . based on individual channel fusions with _METHOD_ we confirmed the localization of _PROTEIN_ and at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as well as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the number of _PROTEIN_ channels targeted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ seemed to be strictly controlled however since a large fraction of _PROTEIN_ was found to be localized in the _LOCATION_ . longer incubation after transformation did not result in enhanced export to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ share amino acid identity in the region of tmd . their cytoplasmic domains in contrast show little sequence conservation . we exchanged the amino and the _PROTEIN_ termini between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and determined the sub cellular localization of the resulting chimeric proteins . supporting our observation that the motif of _PROTEIN_ is not required for _LOCATION_ targeting _PROTEIN_ possessing the nt of _PROTEIN_ still trafficked to the tonoplast . we thus concluded that the nt of _PROTEIN_ is not necessary for _LOCATION_ targeting of _PROTEIN_ nor is the _PROTEIN_ nt sufficient to redirect _PROTEIN_ targeting . consequently no dominant targeting motifs seem to be present in the nt of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . we then exchanged the ct of _PROTEIN_ with the ct of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was found in the _LOCATION_ but was no longer present in the tonoplast . conversely the _PROTEIN_ ct did not cause redirection of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ . these observations indicate that the _PROTEIN_ ct might be required but is not sufficient for _LOCATION_ targeting . in addition to switching cytoplasmic domains we also generated _PROTEIN_ chimeras which comprised the n terminus the first pore and the internal cytoplasmic loop of one channel fused to the second pore and cytoplasmic c terminus of the other channel . following transient _PROTEIN_ both chimeras accumulated in the _LOCATION_ network confirming that the _PROTEIN_ ct is not sufficient for _LOCATION_ localization . at this point we can not exclude the possibility that the _PROTEIN_ chimeric channels are retained in the _LOCATION_ by other means than the missing targeting information of the _PROTEIN_ ct. to test whether the _PROTEIN_ ct actually contains targeting signals and to identify them we dissected the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ by a series of truncations . according to the consensus transmembrane prediction for tpk channels the cytoplasmic ct of _PROTEIN_ initiates at amino acid position c terminal to and extents to amino acid position . _PROTEIN_ also contains two ef hands in this region that exhibit structural homology to the neuronal ca binding protein calcineurin . taking advantage of the crystal structures of calcineurin in complex with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we generated a homology model highlighting the helix loop helix structure of this domain . based on this model we generated deletion mutants which were named according to the position of their end point relative to the helices and bridging loops . the first construct investigated was the _PROTEIN_ mutant lacking the entire cytoplasmic ct _PROTEIN_ . this mutant as well as _PROTEIN_ exhibited persistent _LOCATION_ retention . in a search for _LOCATION_ escape motifs we gradually increased the length of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ terminus relative to . when we extended the _PROTEIN_ ct to include helix _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ escaped from the _LOCATION_ h following transformation and partially entered _LOCATION_ stacks . compared to full length _PROTEIN_ however trafficking of _PROTEIN_ was considerably slower _PROTEIN_ . after extending the ct to include _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ export appeared accelerated and h following transformation mutant channels appeared in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . this suggests that either contains _LOCATION_ sorting information or that _LOCATION_ localization is simply a consequence of accelerated _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ transport . interestingly the _PROTEIN_ mutants and possessing the entire ef hand i seemed to have lost _LOCATION_ targeting information again and appeared almost exclusively in the _LOCATION_ when recorded h following transformation _PROTEIN_ . about h _PROTEIN_ however those channels also reached the _LOCATION_ indicating delayed _LOCATION_ sorting _PROTEIN_ . finally when appending helix _PROTEIN_ or extending the _PROTEIN_ ct beyond this region _PROTEIN_ all truncated mutants showed wild type like targeting to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . based on our findings on _PROTEIN_ targeting the minimal requirement for _LOCATION_ export of the channel is and for further export into the _LOCATION_ is necessary . notably both domains are missing in _PROTEIN_ which is largely retained in the _LOCATION_ . we therefore looked for known sorting motifs within the region and identified three diacidic motifs . while the first diacidic motif is located within daii and daiii comprise part of the loop in the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ . to test whether one of these diacidic motifs plays a role in _LOCATION_ export of _PROTEIN_ we replaced the respective acidic amino acids by glycines . mutations in daii and iii did not affect _LOCATION_ trafficking of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in contrast the dai mutation of _PROTEIN_ resulted in full _LOCATION_ retention _PROTEIN_ supporting the idea that a diacidic motif is required for the _LOCATION_ export of _PROTEIN_ . interestingly plant _PROTEIN_ orthologs from potato or rice for example carry a similar dle motif within an ef hand suggesting a common principle in the _LOCATION_ export of these channels . on the contrary the arabidopsis paralogues of _PROTEIN_ lack such a diacidic motif in their respective c terminal domain suggesting that these channels either use different signals for selective _LOCATION_ export or leave the _LOCATION_ by bulk flow . in the course of these experiments we tested the importance of the _PROTEIN_ ct in _LOCATION_ trafficking of this ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ member of the tpk family . in these studies we observed that _PROTEIN_ in contrast to _PROTEIN_ could be effectively transported to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . due to the lack of unambiguous ct sorting motifs in _PROTEIN_ we focused on the role of tmds since tmds have already been shown to bear _LOCATION_ retention motifs or physical sorting information . in order to test whether tmd located signals are involved in _LOCATION_ sorting the last transmembrane domain of either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ was fused to _METHOD_ . the _PROTEIN_ construct comprising aa exhibited _PROTEIN_ localization in the _LOCATION_ up to h post transformation . this is in contrast to the _LOCATION_ marker _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ which intensely stains the _LOCATION_ . similar to _LOCATION_ the _PROTEIN_ construct composed of aa accumulated in the _LOCATION_ . to investigate whether the _PROTEIN_ ct possessing the diacidic motif would promote the _LOCATION_ export of _PROTEIN_ we extended this construct to cover aa . _LOCATION_ export of the corresponding _METHOD_ fusion protein however was still hampered resulting in _LOCATION_ retention of _PROTEIN_ ct .
