the myristoylated calcium sensor _PROTEIN_ and its interacting protein kinase _PROTEIN_ play critical regulatory roles in salt tolerance . mutations in either of these proteins render arabidopsis thaliana plants hypersensitive to salt stress . we report here the isolation and characterization of a mutant called _PROTEIN_ that enhances the salt sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ and also causes increased salt sensitivity by itself . _PROTEIN_ encodes a chloroplast localized protein with a pdz domain at the n terminal region and a rubredoxin domain in the c terminal part . rubredoxins are known to be involved in the reduction of superoxide in some anaerobic bacteria . the _PROTEIN_ mutation causes enhanced accumulation of reactive oxygen species particularly under salt stress . ros also accumulate to higher levels in _PROTEIN_ but not in _PROTEIN_ mutants . the _PROTEIN_ mutation does not enhance _PROTEIN_ phenotypes . also _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants but not _PROTEIN_ mutants show increased sensitivity to oxidative stress . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ functions in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species resulting from salt stress by participating in a new salt tolerance pathway that may involve _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ .
identification of _PROTEIN_ seedlings from individual t dna insertion lines in the _PROTEIN_ genetic background were screened for suppressors and enhancers of _PROTEIN_ hypersensitivity to nacl . the _PROTEIN_ mutant was identified as conferring increased sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ to as little as mm nacl . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant grows slightly slower than _PROTEIN_ in medium without added nacl . the severely sensitive phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant to nacl indicates that it even may be sensitive to salts or other aspects of the normal growth environment that affect ros production . however lowering the concentrations of _METHOD_ salts or sucrose in the medium did not affect the growth of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ relative to the other genotypes . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant plants were backcrossed with _PROTEIN_ plants . all resulting plants exhibited a _PROTEIN_ like phenotype in the presence of mm nacl . progeny from the self crossed segregated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which indicates that _PROTEIN_ is a monogenic recessive mutation in a _LOCATION_ gene . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant plants also displayed significantly increased sensitivity to nacl treatment in soil compared to _PROTEIN_ . the double mutant gained much less fresh weight during days of nacl treatment compared to _PROTEIN_ plants . the salt hypersensitive phenotype of _PROTEIN_ was not evident until more severe stress was applied . the _PROTEIN_ mutation enhances the k deficient phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutant.seedlings of the _PROTEIN_ mutant have impaired growth on medium containing low levels of k and require mm k for optimal root growth . root elongation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings was substantially less than that of _PROTEIN_ in medium with low k . the enhancement of the k deficiency phenotype of _PROTEIN_ by the _PROTEIN_ mutation indicates that _PROTEIN_ is involved in controlling k nutrition separately from _PROTEIN_ and appears to function in a separate signal pathway that mediates stress tolerance . external fails to improve the salt tolerance of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant.high levels of external can ameliorate _PROTEIN_ sensitivity to nacl stress at least in part through improved k /na selectivity . without added the root growth of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants is arrested at mm nacl . increasing the concentration to mm or higher greatly improves the salt tolerance of _PROTEIN_ plants but not the tolerance of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants . these results further substantiate that _PROTEIN_ mediates salt tolerance by a new pathway independent of _PROTEIN_ . the increased salt sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ involves imbalanced ion homeostasis.without stress both _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants accumulated slightly higher levels of na and k compared to wild type plants . when treated with mm nacl _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants accumulated the highest amount of na but the lowest k among the genotypes tested . consequently the ratio of k to na in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant plants is the lowest with or without nacl stress . we isolated the _PROTEIN_ single mutant from the plants from a cross between the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . the levels of na in _PROTEIN_ single mutants under nacl stress were elevated compared to wild type plants whereas _PROTEIN_ mutants accumulated less k than the wild type . under normal conditions the levels of k and na accumulation as well as the ratios of k to na in the _PROTEIN_ mutants are essentially the same as wild type . however when treated with nacl the ratios of k to na in the _PROTEIN_ mutants are significantly lower than wild type . the _PROTEIN_ mutation does not enhance the salt sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ mutant plants.in the absence of nacl the growth of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is similar to that of _PROTEIN_ . the growth response of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to nacl is similar to that of _PROTEIN_ over various concentrations of nacl . the inability of the _PROTEIN_ mutation to affect the salt sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ plants indicates that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may function in a common pathway controlling salt tolerance . _PROTEIN_ encodes a pdz domain containing rubredoxin like protein.we isolated the genomic dna fragment flanking the left border of a t dna insertion in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by tail pcr . sequence analysis indicated that the t dna was located bp upstream of the start codon of an open reading frame for _GENE_ . constitutive _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence under control of the camv promoter in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant plants reversed the effect of the _PROTEIN_ mutation . the _PROTEIN_ gene encodes a polypeptide containing two interesting domains a putative pdz domain in the n terminal region that is potentially involved in protein protein interactions and a domain at the c terminal part resembling rubredoxin . _PROTEIN_ shows highest sequence similarity in the rubredoxin domain with rubredoxin proteins from pyrococcus furiosus and chlorobaculum tepidum . _PROTEIN_ also shares high sequence similarity in the pdz domain with the human pdz domain containing guanine nucleotide exchange _PROTEIN_ i . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is constitutively _PROTEIN_ in wild type plants and its _PROTEIN_ is abolished in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . the transcript of _PROTEIN_ is more abundant in the shoot than root . interestingly we observed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was also reduced in the _PROTEIN_ mutant under salt stress indicating that _PROTEIN_ is a positive regulator of _PROTEIN_ transcript accumulation . we also produced arabidopsis transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ an _PROTEIN_ promoter gus fusion gene . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ gus was observed in all tissues of seedlings with weaker _PROTEIN_ in the root tips . strong gus _PROTEIN_ was also detected in the anther . the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ was determined by a transient _PROTEIN_ assay of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein which revealed that _PROTEIN_ accumulates in the chloroplast . _PROTEIN_ single mutations also confer reduced tolerance to salt.the _PROTEIN_ single mutant seedlings are more sensitive to nacl than the wild type . this result indicates that _PROTEIN_ is required for normal salt tolerance . a t dna insertion line _PROTEIN_ which has a t dna insertion in the _GENE_ gene is more sensitive to nacl than its wild type background . consistent with their allelic nature plants from a cross between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ showed a level of sensitivity to mm nacl that was similar to the parental plants . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings grew nearly normally compared to their wild types in control medium without stress . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are involved in the control of ros detoxification.rubredoxins are known to act as electron carriers for various enzymes . reports have described the involvement of rubredoxins in oxidative stress protection in desulfovibrio gigas desulfovibrio vulgaris and treponema pallidum . _PROTEIN_ encodes a chloroplast protein with a putative rubredoxin domain that may also function as an electron carrier . we assayed _PROTEIN_ recombinant protein for possible rubredoxin activity and found that it does not appear to act as an electron donor or acceptor in a superoxide reductase reaction system from pyrococcus furiosus . nevertheless an analysis of the ros levels in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants revealed that the mutants accumulate higher amounts of ros as detected by cm staining followed by confocal imaging . stress treatment with mm nacl for h stimulated the accumulation of ros in wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants . however _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants accumulated ros to much higher levels . staining with nitroblue tetrazolium specifically detects superoxide radicals . as shown in fig . under normal growth conditions _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants have slightly more superoxide accumulation than _PROTEIN_ or wild type plants . however after treatment with mm nacl for day _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants accumulated much more superoxide than _PROTEIN_ plants or wild type plants indicating that hyperaccumulation of superoxide resulting from the _PROTEIN_ mutation is independent of _PROTEIN_ . without stress _PROTEIN_ plants displayed a low level of similar to that in the wild type . when treated with mm nacl for h _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants all accumulated substantially higher levels of than _PROTEIN_ or wild type plants . interestingly _PROTEIN_ mutant plants also accumulated more ros than wild type or _PROTEIN_ plants with or without nacl stress . however the _PROTEIN_ mutation has no additive effect with the _PROTEIN_ mutation which indicates that genetically _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may function in a common pathway controlling ros detoxification in response to nacl stress . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mediate tolerance to general oxidative stress.we examined the tolerance of _PROTEIN_ mutants to oxidative stress caused by conditions other than nacl stress . wild type col and _PROTEIN_ plants can tolerate and methyl viologen treatment as indicated by their abilities to _PROTEIN_ chlorophyll in leaves . the _PROTEIN_ mutation enhances the sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ to both and methyl viologen . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants all showed a hypersensitive response to these stress conditions . in addition the germination and postgermination growth and development of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants are more inhibited by compared to _PROTEIN_ or wild type control plants .
