myosins are molecular motors that carry cargo on actin filaments in eukaryotic cells . seventeen myosin genes have been identified in the _LOCATION_ genome of arabidopsis . the myosin genes can be divided into two plant specific subfamilies class viii with four members and class xi with members . class xi myosins are related to animal and fungal myosin class v that are responsible for movement of particular vesicles and organelles . organelle localization of only one of the arabidopsis myosin xi _PROTEIN_ which is found on _LOCATION_ has so far been reported . little information is available concerning the remaining class xi myosins . we investigated of the class xi arabidopsis myosins . cdnas corresponding to the tail region of myosin genes were generated and incorporated into a vector to encode _METHOD_ myosin tail fusion proteins lacking the motor domain . chimeric genes incorporating tail regions of myosin xi _PROTEIN_ myosin xi _PROTEIN_ myosin xi myosin xi myosin xi and myosin xi were _PROTEIN_ transiently . all _METHOD_ myosin tail fusion proteins were targeted to small organelles ranging in size from to . despite the absence of a motor domain the _METHOD_ labeled organelles were motile in most cells . tail cropping experiments demonstrated that the coiled coil region was required for specific localization and shorter tail regions were inadequate for targeting . myosin xi _PROTEIN_ previously reported to localize to _LOCATION_ by _METHOD_ labeled both _LOCATION_ and vesicles when _PROTEIN_ as a _METHOD_ tail fusion . none of the _METHOD_ myosin tail fusions interacted with chloroplasts and only one _METHOD_ tail fusion appeared to sometimes co localize with _METHOD_ proteins targeted to _LOCATION_ and mitochondria . myosin xi tails extending from the coiled coil region to the c terminus label specific vesicles and/or organelles when transiently _PROTEIN_ as _METHOD_ fusions in plant cells . although comparable constructs lacking the motor domain result in a dominant negative effect on organelle motility in animal _METHOD_ the plant organelles remained motile . _METHOD_ myosin tail fusions provide specific labeling for vesicles of unknown composition whose identity can be investigated in future studies .
in order to examine possible localization of the _METHOD_ tail fusions to mitochondria _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ bodies we needed constructs _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins known to localize to these compartments . previously we had shown that a yeast coxiv transit sequence fused to _METHOD_ resulted in specific labeling of mitochondria _PROTEIN_ . for specific labeling of _LOCATION_ bodies we obtained the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ construct that boevink et al _PROTEIN_ used to describe the remarkable motility of plant _LOCATION_ stacks . in order to label perixosomes we decided to make fusions of a peroxisomal resident enzyme catalase which has the uncleavable tripeptide of the _PROTEIN_ at the c terminus _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we produced n terminal _METHOD_ or fusion genes with at catalase . after transient _PROTEIN_ both _METHOD_ and constructs did label _LOCATION_ in onion cells as well as in tobacco leaves as expected . the labeled _LOCATION_ exhibited motility and similar to that previously observed in arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ the signal fused to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ catalase and catalase label _LOCATION_ . a transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ catalase in onion cells

colored in red . c transient _PROTEIN_ of catalase in tobacco leaves h after agrobacterium infiltration . _METHOD_ of chloroplasts is pseudo colored in blue . to obtain myosin tail sequences cdna for myosin xi _PROTEIN_ myosin xi _PROTEIN_ myosin xi myosin xi myosin xi and myosin xi was obtained from arabidopsis thaliana columbia leaves by rt pcr . sequencing of two cdnas for each gene confirmed that the gene model in genbank was correct . a few cdnas exhibited minor nucleotide alterations likely pcr _LOCATION_ that did not affect the amino acid sequence . we did not detect any alternative splicing however more thorough studies using transcripts from a variety of tissues will be needed to determine whether these genes transcripts exist in multiple _METHOD_ . amino acid alignment of the predicted tail sequence from the six cloned myosin tails shows a number of regions with high sequence identity . five of the myosins exhibit significant sequence identity in the so called `` dilute '' domain . the tail of myosin xi is the shortest and lacks the dilute domain entirely . on a phylogenetic tree based on full length arabidopsis myosin alignments reddy and day showed myosin xi _PROTEIN_ and myosin xi are closely related and myosin xi _PROTEIN_ and myosin xi also group together while myosin xi and myosin xi are more diverged _PROTEIN_ . when we compare the amino acid sequences of the tail regions of the myosins we have investigated we note that the same two myosins within each of two pairs exhibit the highest similarity to one another . myosin xi is more similar to the myosinxi pair than to the other myosins . protein sequence similarity of myosin tails . a protein sequence alignment of the six myosin tail constructs used in this study . myosin xi has the shortest tail . identical and similar amino acids are highlighted in grayscale . coiled coil regions are marked in pink and the dilute domains in yellow . myosin gene numbers were derived from table in reddy and day . b cladogram based on similarity . note the pairs myosinxi and myosinxi . myosin xi is more similar to the myosinxi pair than to the other myosins . myosinxi is the most diverged . `` '' refers to the confidence level of the analysis . we designed ypf fusion constructs in agrobacterium vector pearlygate for each of the six myosin tails . the myosin tail constructs were designed in such a way that the n terminal actin binding motor domain and the neck domain containing the iq motif would be missing and replaced by the _METHOD_ protein . in melanocytes comparable _METHOD_ tail fusions result in specific labeling of melanosomes _PROTEIN_ . the tail region in our constructs starts after the iq motif and contains a coiled coil region as well as a `` dilute '' domain near the c terminus . the constructs were either transiently _PROTEIN_ in onion cells or in a. thaliana leaves by bombardment or in tobacco leaves by agroinfiltration . h after bombardment or h after agrobacterium infiltration a yellow _METHOD_ signal was observed in the cells of the transformed tissues . the _METHOD_ signal was present in small vesicular structures . while only a few such vesicles are evident in some of the images of a single plane of the cell they are quite numerous in most cells as can be seen in a full projection view of several confocal z stack sections from myosin xi tail _PROTEIN_ tobacco leaf cells . the _METHOD_ vesicles vary in size with measurements revealing that they are between in diameter . thus their size is in the same range as the size of _LOCATION_ mitochondria and _LOCATION_ but smaller than chloroplasts and the non green _LOCATION_ in onion epidermal cells . transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ class xi tail myosins in tobacco leaves . _METHOD_ class xi tail myosins were agroinfiltrated into tobacco leaves and the _PROTEIN_ was observed h _PROTEIN_ . a maximum projection of a z stack series . b f single confocal pictures . the pinhole was more opened in figures d and e. yellow represents the _METHOD_ signal chloroplasts are pseudo colored in red . bar . the labeled vesicles were observed to be motile in most cells examined . in other _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ of defective myosins lacking a functional motor domain results in cessation of movement of the normal cargo carried by the particular myosin a dominant negative phenotype _PROTEIN_ . evidently the abnormal _METHOD_ tail myosin is not able to affect the function of a motor that can operate on the _METHOD_ organelle . if the fusion protein is unable to dimerize with an endogenous myosin and thereby destroy its function then motility would be expected . perhaps unexpectedly the fusion protein can not dimerize with its homologous wild type myosin through the coiled coil domain but is still able to bind a cargo . the number of molecules of _METHOD_ myosin present through transient _PROTEIN_ may not be high enough to dimerize with most wild type myosins to create a dominant negative effect . alternatively the _METHOD_ truncated myosin may be interacting with subcellular structures to which the wild type myosin does not normally adhere . another explanation is that that more than one class xi myosin is responsible for moving the same cargo . a further possible reason for the continued movement of the unidentified vesicles is that other motors move the same vesicle on microtubules use of both the microfilaments and microtubules for motility has been reported for both _LOCATION_ stacks _PROTEIN_ and chloroplasts . in animals melanosomes are moved by both microtubule and actin motors _PROTEIN_ . however the mobility of plant _LOCATION_ is prevented by actin and myosin inhibitors so the continued movement of these organelles can not be explained by use of microtubule motors . the average speed of the mobile vesicular structures and the length of the average track on which the organelles move differs depending on cell type and particular _METHOD_ myosin _PROTEIN_ . the onion epidermal cells are larger and more elongate in shape that most mesophyll cells and it is evident that _LOCATION_ exhibit a greater speed and track length in the non green epidermal vs. green leaf cells . the difference in average organelle track speed in mesophyll cells exhibited by structures labeled by _METHOD_ myosin xi vs. xi and xi suggests that the populations of organelles labeled by these three myosins are not identical . it is clear that all these populations exhibit higher mobility and track length than vesicular structures exhibiting brownian movement . organelle motility . a track length track displacement and average speed of labeled organelles were analyzed on time series . the data represents the mean values from at least different experiments and a range of organelles were analyzed by construct . the plant material used for the labeled organelle motility determination is marked in brackets . in order to determine which myosin tail length would be sufficient for labeling of discrete structures we designed four different constructs varying by their length . the constructs start either at the half coiled coil region or just after the coiled coil region or at the half length of the tail or just before the `` dilute '' domain . the c terminus was kept intact in the deletion constructs because studies have shown that mouse myova lacking the c terminus was unable to co localize with melanosomes in melanocytes _PROTEIN_ . the amino acid position of each domain was obtained by searching the pfam database . deletion constructs were made for myosin xi _PROTEIN_ myosin xi _PROTEIN_ myosin xi and myosin xi . schematic representation of myosin constructs varying by tail length . schematic representation of the fusion constructs with different tail lengths for myosin xi myosin xi myosin xi and myosin xi . the position of the amino acid based on the full length protein sequence is shown for each construct . after agroinfiltration no major organelle targeting was obtained with any _METHOD_ dilute construct as compared to full length tail constructs . the _METHOD_ signal with the globular dilute domain constructs was primarily in the cytoplasm . proteins _PROTEIN_ from c half tail fusion constructs also were usually not specifically targeted to organelles . sometimes a few punctate structures were labeled but the labeled entities did not move as freely as those observed after labeling with the complete tail constructs . myosin xi and xi _METHOD_ fusions without the coiled coil domain were usually able to label vesicles but myosin xi without the coiled coil region resulted in unspecific cytoplasmic labeling . while myosin xi and myosin xi _METHOD_ fusions lacking half the coiled coil region still labeled vesicles myosin xi _METHOD_ tail fusions resulted in only labeling of vesicles in very few cells . for myosin xi evidently the complete coiled coil domain is necessary for targeting to a cargo . as observed with the full length _METHOD_ tail fusions movement of the organelles occurred when they were labeled with half coil and no coil constructs . short myosin xi tail length fusion constructs are insufficient to be targeted to organelles . tobacco leaf cells after agrobacterium infiltration with different myosin tail length fusion constructs . a d complete tail constructs . e g coil constructs . h j nocoil constructs . k n tail constructs . o r dilute constructs . the yellow signal is from the _METHOD_ fusion constructs red is chlorophyll _METHOD_ . the shorter the tail the more unspecific cytoplasmic labeling is observed . rather few punctuate structures were observed in cells with tail or dilute constructs . n/d not determined . bar . while the shape and size of the labeled structures following transient _METHOD_ tail _PROTEIN_ eliminated chloroplasts and non green _LOCATION_ from further consideration the labeled structures were in the size range of _LOCATION_ bodies mitochondria or _LOCATION_ . we transiently co _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins known to label these compartments in order to determine whether any myosin xi labeled compartments corresponded to these organelle types . we _PROTEIN_ either the catalase construct for _LOCATION_ coxiv _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ for mitochondria and _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ for _LOCATION_ labeling . figures show the result of the co localization experiments for the six studied myosins . co localization experiment with _METHOD_ myosin xi tail and _METHOD_ myosin xi nocoil against _LOCATION_ mitochondrial and _LOCATION_ markers . transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ myosin xi tail or _METHOD_ myosin xi nocoil in tobacco leaves h after agrobacterium co infiltration with either _LOCATION_ marker

with _METHOD_ myosin xi tail and _METHOD_ myosin xi tail against _LOCATION_ mitochondrial and _LOCATION_ markers . transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ myosin xi tail or _METHOD_ myosin xi tail in tobacco leaves h after agrobacterium co infiltration with either _LOCATION_ marker catalase or mitochondrial marker coxiv _METHOD_ or _LOCATION_ marker _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . all signals are pseudo colored . bar . for myosin xi the `` nocoil '' construct was _PROTEIN_ rather than the full tail region because for unknown reasons the shorter construct produced more consistent labeling . _METHOD_ myosin xi nocoil co localized with the peroxisomal catalase marker but not with the mitochondrial or _LOCATION_ body marker . the _METHOD_ myosin xi tail _METHOD_ myosin xi tail and _METHOD_ myosin xi tail do not co localize with any of the markers . _METHOD_ myosin xi tail did not co localize with the _LOCATION_ marker but slight overlaps were observed with the mitochondrial and _LOCATION_ markers . we did not detect any conclusive co localization with any marker for _METHOD_ myosin xi tail though occasionally there were a few slight overlaps with _LOCATION_ stacks . the co localization of ypf myosin xi nocoil _METHOD_ the finding that this myosin interacts with _LOCATION_ as previously reported in studies using anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies in transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ a _METHOD_ tagged peroxisomal targeting signal peptide . none of the other five myosin constructs tested co localized with this _LOCATION_ marker . the overlap of the signal of _METHOD_ myosin xi tail with the _LOCATION_ and mitochondrial markers is suggestive but not entirely conclusive because _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ are difficult to separate due to overlapping excitation peaks . further studies with additional control _METHOD_ protein fusions need to be undertaken in order to verify whether _METHOD_ myosin xi interacts with _LOCATION_ bodies and mitochondria . nevertheless our experiments do show that motile vesicles are reproducibly labeled with myosin _METHOD_ tail fusions . the identity of these vesicles can be further probed in the future through co localization with proteins and dyes known to label various compartments involved in vesicular transport processes . instead of the reproducible organelle labeling seen in most experiments on rare occasions we observed long filamentous structures with the characteristic appearance of actin filaments . the linear structures were similar to actin microfilaments found in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis seedlings or _METHOD_ talin cells . such labeling was unexpected because the actin binding motor domain is missing in the fusion proteins . however if heterodimerization between the _METHOD_ myosin tail fusions and endogenous myosins sometimes occurs then perhaps the myosin heterodimer could interact with actin filaments resulting in labeling . perhaps the rare cells giving filamentous structures were _PROTEIN_ unusually high amounts of the _METHOD_ tail fusion proteins . because the proteins are being _PROTEIN_ transiently from t dna following agroinfilitration different cells are likely to accumulate different amounts of the _METHOD_ myosin proteins . appearance of filamentous structures labeled by myosin constructs . a maximum projection of serial confocal sections of an onion epidermal cell transiently _PROTEIN_

of an onion epidermal cell transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ myosin xi tail . bar in a c . d close up of the microtubule like structures in an onion epidermal cell transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ myosin xi tail . not all linear structures appeared similar to microfilaments . sometimes we observed short linear structures that appeared more similar to microtubules than microfilaments . usually a myosin would not be expected to react with microtubules . however there is evidence that motors sometimes link the actin and tubulin _LOCATION_ . the drosophila myosin vi interacts with a microtubule plus end binding protein . even though _LOCATION_ move on microfilaments the plant peroxisomal multifunctional protein was shown to bind cortical microtubules in vitro and _LOCATION_ and microtubules were observed to interact . in _PROTEIN_ cells _LOCATION_ association with microtubules was also described . thus for unknown reasons perhaps the myosin xi _METHOD_ tail constructs can sometimes interact with microtubules .
