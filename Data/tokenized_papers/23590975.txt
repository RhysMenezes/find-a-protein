plants make coenzyme a in the cytoplasm but use it for reactions in mitochondria chloroplasts and _LOCATION_ implying that these organelles have coa transporters . a plant peroxisomal coa transporter is already known but plant mitochondrial or chloroplastic coa transporters are not . mitochondrial coa transporters belonging to the mitochondrial carrier family however have been identified in yeast and mammals . comparative genomic analysis indicated that _METHOD_ have two distinct homologs of these mitochondrial coa transporters whereas nonflowering plants have only one . the homologs from maize _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and arabidopsis all complemented the growth defect of the yeast mitochondrial coa carrier mutant and substantially restored its mitochondrial coa level confirming that these proteins have coa transport activity . dual import assays with purified pea mitochondria and chloroplasts and subcellular localization of green _METHOD_ protein fusions in transiently transformed tobacco bright yellow cells showed that the maize and arabidopsis proteins are targeted to mitochondria . consistent with the ubiquitous importance of coa the maize and arabidopsis mitochondrial coa transporter genes are _PROTEIN_ at similar levels throughout the plant . these data show that representatives of both monocotyledons and eudicotyledons have twin mitochondrially located mitochondrial carrier family carriers for coa . the highly conserved nature of these carriers makes possible their reliable annotation in other angiosperm genomes .
an earlier analysis of arabidopsis human and yeast mcf proteins identified _GENE_ and _GENE_ as potential coa carriers based on the presence of sequence motifs similar to those in known mitochondrially localized coa carriers . _GENE_ and _GENE_ share only amino acid identity and so are substantially diverged . blast searches of the maize genome using each arabidopsis sequence as query detected _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as the closest homologs of _GENE_ and _GENE_ respectively . all four proteins have the tripartite structure that characterizes the mcf and are predicted to contain the usual six transmembrane domains . phylogenetic analyses of these proteins the human and yeast mitochondrial coa carriers and all arabidopsis yeast and human mcf proteins consistently placed all four candidates and the yeast and human coa carriers in the same clade . thus among all arabidopsis mcf proteins those closest to the known mitochondrially localized coa carriers are the candidates and among all yeast or human mcf proteins the candidates are closest to the known mitochondrial coa carriers . the recently identified peroxisomal coa carriers from human and arabidopsis occupy a very different clade . the phylogenetic trees all separate the four candidate genes into two types type composed of _GENE_ and and type composed of _GENE_ and . one or two genes of each type were found in all other eudicotyledon and monocotyledon genomes and transcriptomes examined as well as in that of the basal angiosperm amborella trichopoda . in contrast _METHOD_ had type but not type sequences whereas lower plants each had a single sequence that could not be confidently assigned to either type . deletion of the yeast _PROTEIN_ gene encoding a mitochondrial coa transporter results in strongly retarded growth on rich medium containing a nonfermentable _PROTEIN_ source and _PROTEIN_ of a functional coa carrier protein in the deletant strain restores normal growth . the human leu homolog used as a positive control restored normal growth on yeast extract bacto peptone medium plates containing glycerol as expected . similarly all four candidate plant coa transporters _GENE_ _GENE_ and restored normal growth as opposed to little or no growth for cells transformed with vector alone or a negative control _PROTEIN_ . similar results were obtained in liquid medium . these data indicate that the plant type and type proteins have coa transport activity and that they are targeted to mitochondria in yeast . furthermore because the yeast leu protein is known to be in the mitochondrial inner _LOCATION_ the observed complementation by the plant proteins indicates that they are likewise at least in part localized in the inner _LOCATION_ when _PROTEIN_ in yeast . the coa content in mitochondria of the strain is severely reduced compared with the wild type reflecting the role of leu in mitochondrial coa import . the candidate proteins from maize and arabidopsis complemented this biochemical phenotype of the strain _PROTEIN_ of the type candidates _GENE_ and fully restored mitochondrial coa levels to that of the wild type _PROTEIN_ of the type candidates _GENE_ and restored levels to over one half that of the wild type . these data reinforce the conclusion that the plant proteins mediate coa transport into yeast mitochondria . organellar targeting of the four coa carrier candidates was investigated using dual import assays in which labeled proteins are incubated with a mixture of purified pea mitochondria and chloroplasts and then reisolated . soybean alternative oxidase and arabidopsis ygfz protein were used as positive controls for mitochondrial and chloroplast import respectively . all four candidates behaved similarly to the mitochondria targeted control protein which indicates an intramitochondrial location and is consistent with the complementation evidence above for an inner _LOCATION_ location . the observed lack of difference between the molecular _METHOD_ of the precursors and the imported proteins is expected because mcf proteins typically lack cleavable targeting peptides . none of the candidates mirrored the behavior of the chloroplast targeted control protein . as a second approach for investigating subcellular localization tobacco bright yellow cells serving as a model plant cell system for studying protein localization were transiently transformed with each of the four candidates linked at their n or c termini to _METHOD_ and examined by _METHOD_ microscopy . the _PROTEIN_ c terminal fusions of both maize proteins and both arabidopsis proteins showed a _METHOD_ pattern that colocalized with that attributable to the endogenous mitochondrial inner _LOCATION_ marker the _PROTEIN_ subunit . notably the fusion proteins often yielded a torus like _METHOD_ pattern that circled the more punctate _METHOD_ attributable to the _PROTEIN_ suggesting that they may localize to two distinct subdomains of the inner mitochondrial _LOCATION_ the inner boundary _LOCATION_ and the cristae _LOCATION_ . thus the toroid _METHOD_ pattern exhibited by the candidate fusion proteins in by cells resembles that of several yeast _METHOD_ tagged proteins that preferentially localize to the inner boundary _LOCATION_ which lies parallel to the mitochondrial outer _LOCATION_ . the punctate _METHOD_ pattern exhibited by endogenous _PROTEIN_ in by cells on the other hand is consistent with the localization of its yeast counterpart in the cristae _LOCATION_ which extends into the _PROTEIN_ . there are however other possible explanations for the concentration of _METHOD_ tagged inner _LOCATION_ proteins at the mitochondrial rim so this question needs to be studied in more detail . unlike the c terminal fusions the n terminal _METHOD_ fusions for all four proteins localized only partially to mitochondria and mostly to the _LOCATION_ suggesting that the n terminally appended _METHOD_ moiety interfered with the mitochondrial targeting information in the coa carriers . similar interference with mitochondrial targeting was observed for n terminal fusions of _METHOD_ to thiamin diphosphate carriers . finally there was no apparent targeting of either the c or n terminal _METHOD_ fusion protein to _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ . together the results of dual import assays and of cell imaging demonstrate the targeting of all four candidate proteins to plant mitochondria and not other organelles . the relative levels of the and mrnas were determined by quantitative reverse transcription pcr in tissues representing the whole adult maize plant . both genes are _PROTEIN_ in all tissues tested with fairly little variation . their _PROTEIN_ patterns are similar except that the type gene predominates in silks and the type gene predominates in tassels . analysis of _PROTEIN_ data for both maize genes from genome wide rna seq data sets gave a similar picture . publicly available microarray data for the arabidopsis genes likewise show _PROTEIN_ throughout the plant with relatively little variation except in stamens and pollen and with the type gene _GENE_ always predominant . the ubiquitous _PROTEIN_ of both types of coa carrier gene in both species is consistent with the universal requirement of mitochondria for coa which is essential among other things for the oxidation of pyruvate via the tricarboxylic acid cycle .
