the _LOCATION_ proteome of chloroplasts contains multiple proteins involved in antioxidative defense protein folding and repair . to understand this functional protein network we analyzed the quantitative response of the _LOCATION_ associated proteome of arabidopsis wild type and the ascorbate deficient mutant _PROTEIN_ after transition to high light _PROTEIN_ . the soluble _LOCATION_ proteomes of wild type and _PROTEIN_ were compared after and d of _PROTEIN_ using two dimensional gels with three independent experiments followed by a multivariant statistical analysis and tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . after d of _PROTEIN_ both wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants accumulated anthocyanins increased their total ascorbate content and lost of photosystem ii efficiency but showed no bleaching . anthocyanin and total ascorbate concentrations in _PROTEIN_ were respectively and of wild type potentially leading to enhanced oxidative stress in _PROTEIN_ . forty five protein spots significantly changed as a consequence of genotype light treatment or both . independent confirmation was obtained from western blots . the most significant response was the up regulation of _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ likely involved in photosystem i assembly and specific fibrillins a flavin reductase like protein and an aldolase each located in _LOCATION_ associated _LOCATION_ . fe superoxide dismutase was down regulated in _PROTEIN_ while cu zn superoxide dismutase was up regulated . _PROTEIN_ also showed a systematic up regulation of a steroid dehydrogenase like protein . a number of other stress related proteins several _LOCATION_ proteases and lumenal isomerases did not change while _PROTEIN_ increased in wild type upon light stress . these findings are discussed in _METHOD_ of _LOCATION_ metabolism and oxidative stress defense and emphasize that understanding of the chloroplast stress response network must include the enzymatic role of _LOCATION_ .
wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants were grown on soil under a short day length at optimal light intensity for about d to reach a fully developed rosette . throughout the remainder of this article we refer to the _PROTEIN_ line as _PROTEIN_ . as expected _PROTEIN_ plants were reduced in size and _METHOD_ as compared to wild type . light intensity was then increased to photons under otherwise identical conditions . surprisingly after and d of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ visibly accumulated less anthocyanins than wild type in particular when viewing the adaxial side of the leaves . after d of _PROTEIN_ wild type rosettes accumulated about total monomeric anthocyanin per gram fresh weight whereas _PROTEIN_ accumulated only per gram fresh weight corresponding to of wild type levels . total oxidized and reduced ascorbate concentrations in _PROTEIN_ leaves were about of wild type levels under the optimal light conditions . total ascorbate concentrations nearly doubled after d of _PROTEIN_ in both genotypes . about to of the total ascorbate was oxidized in wild type under both light conditions while to of total ascorbate was oxidized in _PROTEIN_ under both light conditions . thus the already smaller pool of ascorbate in _PROTEIN_ appeared more oxidized we note that it is possible that this oxidation is somewhat overestimated due to some interference by oxidation of dithiothreitol used in the assay . to monitor the efficiency of psii one of the prime targets for light induced damage we measured the chlorophyll _METHOD_ maximum photochemical efficiency of psii in the dark _PROTEIN_ state ratio of dark _PROTEIN_ leaves about h into the light period . fv/fm ratios were for both wild type and _PROTEIN_ prior to the _PROTEIN_ treatment and _PROTEIN_ to about and after d of _PROTEIN_ in wild type and _PROTEIN_ respectively . these measurements showed that the _PROTEIN_ induced loss of psii efficiency ranged from to with no significant differences between wild type and _PROTEIN_ . the phenotypic analysis above clearly showed a moderate light induced oxidative stress in both wild type and _PROTEIN_ . to analyze the _PROTEIN_ response of the peripheral lumenal and pg _LOCATION_ proteomes in _PROTEIN_ and wild type _LOCATION_ were purified prior to the _PROTEIN_ treatment and after and d of _PROTEIN_ . after _LOCATION_ purification the peripheral and lumenal _LOCATION_ and pg proteomes were extracted by sonication and analyzed by using immobilized ph gradient strips in the first dimension and gradient _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the second dimension . to allow statistical analysis of the differential _PROTEIN_ of this extracted _LOCATION_ proteome in response to light and ascorbate deficiency the complete experiment was repeated three times including plant growth proteome purification and . throughout this manuscript these three independent experiments are named biological replicates . to reduce gel to gel variation each protein preparation was analyzed on at least three parallel gels . in total we generated and analyzed gels . the gel images looked overall quite similar to each other both when comparing wild type and _PROTEIN_ and when comparing different time points . this indicated that the _LOCATION_ purifications protein extractions and gel staining were reproducible . spots were first automatically detected in all gel images using the same parameters for all gels . subsequently a manual spot editing was carried out for each of the gel images to remove minor features resulting from for example sypro ruby precipitates and to split major trains of spots into single spots . all spots were then quantified and normalized to their respective total gel spot volume . after this first pass manual curation gel images were matched to a reference gel . spots not present on the reference gel were added if they were present on at least five gels in total spots were assigned on this reference gel . intensities of corresponding spots on the three technical gel replicates within a genotype treatment combination were averaged . a total of out of spots had an averaged intensity for all combinations and are hereafter assigned as the complete data set . this set was used for statistical analysis . we tested the effect of the _PROTEIN_ treatment and the genotype as well as their interaction on the complete data set using a multivariance analysis . at p < we observed a significant genotype effect and significant treatment effect for spots each and a significant genotype treatment interaction for two spots totaling spots . when the p value was increased to p < significant spots were detected . all significant spots were analyzed by nano liquid chromatography electrospray tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and proteins could be identified in most spots . a number of spots contained more than one protein and for some of them it was not possible to determine which one was the _PROTEIN_ component . we will not discuss spots in which no proteins were identified nor spots that contained a mixture of proteins of quite equal abundance . in total spots and their protein identities will be discussed and are listed in table i together with a graphic display of the averaged relative spot intensities with sd for each genotype treatment combination . a reference gel with these significant protein spots is shown in supplemental figure . selected differentially accumulating protein spots and details of spot quantification protein content and _METHOD_ based identification the bar _METHOD_ show the average of the spot intensities across the three independent experiments for wild type and _PROTEIN_ at and d of _PROTEIN_ with sds . statistical significance as determined by the multivariant analysis is indicated as g genotype effect t treatment effect and i genotype treatment interaction with indicated maximum p value . experimental pi and molecular _METHOD_ are listed . protein identified in the spots are listed with the mascot mowse score _METHOD_ as a measure of confidence for _METHOD_ based identification . the curated location for each protein is indicated . asterisks indicate modification from original mapman bin . most of the spots that significantly responded to the light treatment were increasingly up regulated with progressive days of light stress . spot contained _PROTEIN_ and spots and all contained _PROTEIN_ . spots and also contained low levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . these proteins are all members of the _PROTEIN_ family . a close up of the spots and is shown in figure . spot contained fru biphosphate aldolase that was recently shown to accumulate in pgs in addition to its abundant accumulation in the chloroplast stroma . spot contained a homolog to _PROTEIN_ in synechocystis and increased fold over d of light treatment . spot contained a flavin reductase related protein with background signals of ser type protease subunit _PROTEIN_ and an rna binding protein _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was a minor contamination of an abundant neighboring spot . in contrast to the up regulation in the spots above spot containing a putative glyoxylase was down regulated fold in wild type but not significantly effected in _PROTEIN_ . spot contained the chaperones and showed an increase in _PROTEIN_ after and d of _PROTEIN_ but no change in accumulation in the wild type . spot contained an like protein and showed a small but consistent increase in _PROTEIN_ . spot was weak containing a breakdown product of cys prx a and increased slightly after and d _PROTEIN_ . however for spot containing the mature cys prx a no significant change was observed this was confirmed by western blotting . spot also contained an like protein and was down regulated upon light treatment . spot contained cu zn sod that was consistently more abundant in _PROTEIN_ . seven identified spots showed a significant differential response to the genotype _PROTEIN_ . spot contained a mix of hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase and the _PROTEIN_ like protein with consistent up regulation in _PROTEIN_ . as mentioned above spot contained cu zn sod and was consistently more abundant in _PROTEIN_ . spot contained a breakdown product of one of the two plastocyanin homologs pc and was also higher in _PROTEIN_ . the response to the genotype of spots and was also significantly different for the _PROTEIN_ treatment . as mentioned in the previous paragraph spot containing a glyoxylase i was down regulated in wild type but not significantly affected in _PROTEIN_ . spot contained the chaperones and showed an increase in _PROTEIN_ in response to and d of _PROTEIN_ but no change in accumulation in the wild type . neighboring spot contained rib p isomerase and was consistently higher in _PROTEIN_ than in wild type . two spots showed only a significant genotype treatment interaction and no effect of genotype or treatment alone . spot contained _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the spot showed a higher accumulation at time point in _PROTEIN_ but a higher accumulation at time point d of _PROTEIN_ in wild type . spot contained and its closely related homolog with lower mowse score . this spot is located close to spot also containing these two _PROTEIN_ homologs as discussed in the previous section . spot showed a small increase in levels in _PROTEIN_ as compared to wild type at the _PROTEIN_ time points consistent with the observations for spot . we confirmed the up regulation of _PROTEIN_ observed by using _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and western blots on total _LOCATION_ protein extracts . prior to light stress the _PROTEIN_ could hardly be observed but their intensity increased several fold after and d of light stress in both wild type and _PROTEIN_ with a slightly stronger response in _PROTEIN_ than in wild type in agreement with the analysis . as also observed by _PROTEIN_ accumulation did not increase from to d in _PROTEIN_ but did increase in this interval in wild type . to ensure that the observed increase was not related to binding and release of _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ we also blotted the total soluble fraction . as expected only a weak signal from _PROTEIN_ was observed . this is in agreement with our proteome analyses of chloroplast subfractions showing that _PROTEIN_ typically associate with _LOCATION_ . we confirmed the up regulation of cu zn sod in _PROTEIN_ as compared to wild type using one dimensional gels and western blots on total soluble extracts . at each time point we observed an up regulation of cu zn sod in _PROTEIN_ as compared to wild type . since _PROTEIN_ of cu zn sod is antagonistic to _PROTEIN_ of the three chloroplast localized fe sods in the chloroplast under copper deficiency we also determined total fe sod accumulation levels in total soluble extracts . indeed the fe sods were down regulated in _PROTEIN_ as compared to wild type . in addition to the statistical analysis and identification of differentially _PROTEIN_ proteins we also specifically looked at the accumulation patterns of known lumenal and peripheral _LOCATION_ proteins that are associated with oxidative stress defense redox regulation proteolysis and folding . to facilitate this analysis we identified the proteins in most of the spots on the gels by _METHOD_ . in total proteins were identified of which were chloroplast predicted by targetp . this set included eight proteases eight chaperones and isomerases stress related proteins eight rna binding and ribosomal proteins proteins of the photosynthetic apparatus and many proteins without known function or with diverse functions in metabolism . we extracted the spot quantifications and statistical analysis for the most relevant spots in which only one protein was identified . details for those spots are listed in table ii and they are also marked on the reference gel . examples were proteases _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and thioredoxin type . also the stromal cys prx a in spot did not change . spot contained peroxiredoxin ii e probably as a major component of the spot and was not significantly changing either . we do point out however that even though not significant at p < some of these spots show a drop after d of _PROTEIN_ followed by an increase in the following days . quantification of proteins involved in stress response and/or protein biogenesis and degradation in quantified and reproducible spots that do not show a significant response to the _PROTEIN_ treatment the genotype or the interaction details of spot quantification protein content and _METHOD_ based identification are listed . the bar _METHOD_ show the average of the spot intensities across the three independent experiments for wild type and _PROTEIN_ at and d of _PROTEIN_ with sds . protein identified in the spots are listed with the mascot mowse score as a measure of confidence for _METHOD_ based identification . the curated location for each protein is indicated . asterisks indicate modification from original mapman bin . several integral _LOCATION_ proteins have been associated with oxidative stress . we tested the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ proteases and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ using western blot analysis of total _LOCATION_ proteins of leaves . _PROTEIN_ levels doubled during the _PROTEIN_ treatment in wild type without a significant increase in _PROTEIN_ . in contrast _PROTEIN_ level did not change significantly upon light stress and no differences were found between _PROTEIN_ and wild type .
arabidopsis wild type and _PROTEIN_ were grown on soil in growth chambers under controlled conditions . the _PROTEIN_ line was originally identified as described in citation and subsequent map based cloning showed that the line has a missense mutation in _GENE_ leading to a gly to asp change in predicted exon . the _PROTEIN_ seeds were kindly provided by dr. p. conklin . approximately d after sowing when plants had fully developed leaf rosettes but were prior to bolting the light intensity was increased to photons _PROTEIN_ while _PROTEIN_ the light dark cycle . complete rosettes were harvested after and d of the _PROTEIN_ treatment . all plant material was collected after h into the light period . fv/fm values of attached leaves were determined during the first half of the light period after a min dark _PROTEIN_ period using a pulse modulated fluorimeter _METHOD_ . for determination of ascorbate mg leaf tissue was ground in liquid nitrogen and suspended in meta phosphoric acid and mm edta . _LOCATION_ were removed by centrifugation at for min at . the soluble extract was neutralized with sodium phosphate buffer to a final concentration of m. ascorbate and dehydro ascorbate were measured according to citation . anthocyanins were extracted from g of leaf tissue ground in liquid nitrogen by addition of ml water and centrifugation at for min . the supernatant was diluted with m sodium acetate at ph and mm potassium chloride at ph and then spun again . total monomeric anthocyanins were measured by recording the as outlined in citation . intact _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were purified on percoll gradients essentially as in citation . the soluble _LOCATION_ proteome were released by mild sonication with a fisher scientific _LOCATION_ dismembrator from a ml _LOCATION_ suspension at mg chlorophyll . soluble proteins were separated from the _LOCATION_ fraction by centrifugation at for min at and then precipitated in acetone . the protein pellet was suspended in m urea chaps triton x and glycerol . protein concentrations were determined with the bradford method . for isoelectric focusing ipg buffer ph to and mm tri butylphosphine were added to the protein samples . one hundred _METHOD_ of proteins were loaded on ipg strips pi to . focusing followed by reduction and alkylation were carried out as described earlier . precast tris hcl gels were used in the second dimension . gels were stained for h with sypro ruby . gel images were taken with a fluor s imager using several exposure times ranging from to s. these images were evaluated for signal to noise ratio sensitivity and number of saturated spots . images with relatively low exposure times were chosen for analysis since they had the best signal to noise ratio while allowing detection of low abundant spots . the chosen gel images had maximally from five to nine saturated spots in particular containing plastocyanin _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . spot _PROTEIN_ and spot were the most frequently saturated . image analysis was carried out using ht analyzer . gels with extensive streaking or poor spot resolution were discarded and new gels were run with the same sample . in total gel images were used for the final data set _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . spot detection was performed using the same settings for all the gel images . to clean the images from false spots each gel was visually inspected and fictitious spots manually removed in ht analyzer . after background subtraction the spot intensity was normalized as percentage of the total spot intensity of the gel . one gel was chosen as a reference and corresponding spots on the gels were matched to the reference gel . to minimize the contribution of gel to gel variation three gels were run for each sample . the logarithm of intensity of correspondent spots on the three gels were averaged and considered as data points . the intensities of nondetected spots were treated as missing values rather than zeros and did not contribute to the average intensity . a multivariance model was used to evaluate plant effect _PROTEIN_ treatment effect and genotype treatment interaction . the statistical model was applied to spots with complete data . we then tested the effect of the _PROTEIN_ treatment and the genotype as well as their interaction using the following equation variation _LOCATION_ . the significance was measured by both the p value and the false positive discovery rate calculated as identified significant spots divided by expected number of false positive spots . a randomization argument was used to adjust the obtained p values according to the formula p_adj . we will discuss two groups of spots that show differences with a probability p of _LOCATION_ less than and less than . protein spots were excised from the gels and automatically or manually digested with trypsin or chymotrypsin . after digestion peptides were analyzed using a caplc esi _METHOD_ . peptides were loaded on a column followed by separation on a pepmap reverse phase nano column using min gradients with water acetonitrile formic acid and acetonitrile water formic acid and a flow rate of . _METHOD_ spectra were processed using mascot distiller and the proteins were identified by searching against the arabidopsis database _PROTEIN_ using in house mascot _PROTEIN_ . mascot search criteria were as follows maximal precursor ion and fragment ion _LOCATION_ and d variable met oxidation maximally missed cleavage minimal significance for protein mowse score p < and minimal ion score . these search results were further filtered to remove all protein identifications that needed peptides matched at rank or higher to realize a significant mowse score . to ensure correct assignment of protein identity to weaker selected spots differentially _PROTEIN_ spots were identified from two or more gels and additional verification of spot matching . in a few cases we identified more than one protein in a particular spot . where possible the protein with a significantly larger number of matching peptides and higher mowse score was assigned as the major contributor to the spot intensity . identified proteins with mowse scores and matched peptide sequences can be found in the _LOCATION_ proteome database at http //ppdb.tc.cornell.edu . for analysis of cellular proteins by western blots wild type and _PROTEIN_ leaves were extracted by mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen and mm tris hcl buffer ph and mm edta . the extracts were spun at for min at the supernatant was transferred to a new tube and spun at k rpm in . the resulting clear supernatant contained the total soluble proteins which were precipitated in tca for min on ice . the pellets were washed with tris and resuspended in laemmli buffer _PROTEIN_ . the pellet from the k spin was washed with tris edta spun again and then resuspended in laemmli buffer . following solubilization insoluble material was removed by a min centrifugation at and the supernatant was reduced and used for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ analysis on acrylamide gels . proteins were blotted on polyvinylidene difluoride _LOCATION_ incubated overnight with primary antisera directly against arabidopsis proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and a potato anti and then detected with a horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence . anti fe sod anti cu zn sod anti _PROTEIN_ anti _PROTEIN_ and anti were provided by p. conklin w. sakamoto k.k . niyogi and p. rey respectively .
