jasmonic acid is a lipid derived signal that regulates a wide variety of developmental and defense related processes in higher plants . ja is synthesized from linolenic acid via an enzymatic pathway that initiates in the _LOCATION_ and terminates in _LOCATION_ . the ja precursor oxo phytodienoic acid is converted in the _LOCATION_ to oxo cyclopentane octanoic acid which subsequently undergoes three rounds of oxidation to yield ja . although most ja biosynthetic enzymes have been identified several key steps in the pathway remain to be elucidated . to address this knowledge gap we employed co _PROTEIN_ analysis to identify genes that are coordinately regulated with known ja biosynthetic components in arabidopsis . among the candidate genes uncovered by this approach was a coumarate coa ligase like member of the acyl activating enzyme gene family which we have named opc coa _PROTEIN_ . in response to wounding _PROTEIN_ null mutants exhibited reduced levels of ja and hyperaccumulation of opc . recombinant _PROTEIN_ was active against both opda and opc as well as medium to long straight chain fatty acids . subcellular localization studies with green _METHOD_ protein tagged _PROTEIN_ showed that the protein is targeted to _LOCATION_ . these findings establish a physiological role for _PROTEIN_ in the activation of ja biosynthetic precursors in leaf _LOCATION_ and further indicate that opc is a physiological substrate for the activation step . the results also demonstrate the utility of co _PROTEIN_ analysis for identification of _PROTEIN_ that contribute to jasmonate homeostasis .
identification of an aae gene that is co regulated with other ja biosynthetic facilitate the discovery of new genes involved in jasmonate biosynthesis we took advantage of the _PROTEIN_ that many components of the pathway are coordinately regulated in arabidopsis . the data mining tool _PROTEIN_ angler uses publicly available affymetrix arabidopsis genechip data to compare the _PROTEIN_ pattern of a given query gene to all other elements in the data set . query of data sets from the nottingham arabidopsis stock center 's microarray data base with _PROTEIN_ a well characterized gene involved in the peroxisomal stage of ja synthesis identified co _PROTEIN_ genes > . the complete list of these genes is given in supplemental table . among these are genes encoding known or putative ja biosynthetic enzymes including lipoxygenases _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . one of the highest ranking genes on the list is a member of the coumarate coa ligase like family of aaes . a potential role for like aaes in ja biosynthesis is supported by two lines of evidence . first all eight members of this clade contain a peroxisomal targeting signal type motif . second two members of this group were previously shown to encode peroxisomal enzymes that activate ja precursors in vitro . results obtained with _PROTEIN_ angler showed that _GENE_ but not _GENE_ nor _GENE_ are co _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ in tissue specific data sets stress and pathogen related data sets and hormone application experiments . based on the results presented below we propose the trivial name opc coa _PROTEIN_ to describe the biochemical function of _GENE_ . co _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ in wound and ja treated arabidopsis leaves was verified by rna blot analysis . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcript levels peaked h after wounding or ja treatment and declined steadily thereafter . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were not induced in wounded or ja treated leaves of the _PROTEIN_ mutant that is defective in ja signaling . rather a low basal level of _PROTEIN_ of both genes was detected in _PROTEIN_ leaves . these results demonstrate that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is tightly coordinated with that of _PROTEIN_ via the jasmonate signaling pathway . physiological role of _PROTEIN_ in jasmonate determine whether _PROTEIN_ has a physiological role in ja synthesis a mutant line _PROTEIN_ for this gene was obtained from the collection of sequence indexed t dna insertions . we also characterized insertion mutants for the two above mentioned like genes that were previously implicated in ja biosynthesis . pcr analysis confirmed the homozygousity of the t dna insert in all three mutant lines . none of these lines exhibited obvious defects in growth development or reproduction . using rna blot analysis with gene specific probes for _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ we found no transcripts in the corresponding mutant line indicating that we were assessing the null phenotype for each mutant . these experiments also showed that _GENE_ and _GENE_ are _PROTEIN_ at a basal level in unwounded leaves of wt plants . in contrast to _PROTEIN_ however these two genes were not induced by mechanical wounding . to assess the effect of the insertion mutations on ja production we used gc _METHOD_ to measure the endogenous levels of ja in mutant and wt plants grown under identical conditions . ja levels in control and wounded leaves of insertion lines corresponding to _GENE_ and _GENE_ were not significantly different from wt levels . we also found that a double mutant defective in both _GENE_ and _GENE_ produced normal levels of ja in response to wounding . in contrast to these mutant lines _PROTEIN_ plants showed a significant reduction in wound induced ja accumulation . the level of ja in wounded _PROTEIN_ leaves at each time point tested was of that observed in wt leaves . this pattern of ja deficiency was observed in three independent experiments . to test the hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ functions as a coa ligase for precursors of ja we measured the relative levels of opda opc and ja in wt and _PROTEIN_ plants in response to wounding . opda and opc levels in wt plants increased within min of wounding and remained steady during the remainder of the time course . opc levels in wounded _PROTEIN_ leaves were significantly greater than that in the wt at both the and min time points . this wound induced hyperaccumulation of opc was associated with _PROTEIN_ amounts of ja in the same extracts . the opda content in wounded and control _PROTEIN_ leaves was not significantly different from that in wt plants . to exclude the possibility that the altered ja and opc content of leaves resulted from a secondary mutation unrelated to the t dna insertion we compared the oxylipin profile in wt and _PROTEIN_ plants to that in an allelic mutant _PROTEIN_ that is homozygous for an independent t dna insertion . the results showed that the wound induced pattern of opda opc and ja accumulation in _PROTEIN_ plants exactly matched that of _PROTEIN_ plants . these findings indicate that _PROTEIN_ has a physiological role in wound induced ja synthesis and further support the idea that opc is an endogenous substrate for the activation step . _PROTEIN_ metabolizes precursors of confirm that the altered levels of ja and opc in wounded _PROTEIN_ leaves result directly from a defect in the coa activation step it was necessary to demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ protein has catalytic activity toward ja precursors . to address this question we _PROTEIN_ recombinant _PROTEIN_ with an n terminal histidine tag in e. coli and purified the enzyme by nickel affinity chromatography . the apparent molecular weight of the purified protein as determined by _PROTEIN_ polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was in good agreement with the calculated molecular weight of . a spectrophotometric assay in which aae catalyzed amp formation is enzymatically coupled to nadh oxidation was used to study the in vitro substrate specificity of purified _PROTEIN_ . the results showed that _PROTEIN_ readily accepts and fatty acid substrates but has little or no activity with shorter chain substrates such as hexanoic and octanoic acids . these findings are consistent with a recent study showing that the same protein _PROTEIN_ does not activate hydroxycinnamic acids involved in phenylpropanoid metabolism . significantly _PROTEIN_ was also highly active with opda and opc . the apparent km of opda and opc was and respectively which is similar to km values reported for other like enzymes that utilize ja precursors in vitro . these results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ has the capacity to activate opda and opc precursors of ja in vitro . _PROTEIN_ is targeted to _LOCATION_ activating enzymes that supply ja precursors for oxidation are expected to reside in the _LOCATION_ . the predicted sequence of _PROTEIN_ contains a consensus peroxisomal targeting signal type motif at the c terminus . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ is targeted to _LOCATION_ in planta we constructed a chimeric gene that encodes a protein in which the _METHOD_ is fused to the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ . this gene was cloned into a binary vector under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter and subsequently introduced into arabidopsis by agrobacterium mediated transformation . as a control for these experiments we also analyzed a transgenic line _PROTEIN_ a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion construct that is known to be targeted to _LOCATION_ . confocal imaging of leaf tissue from _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants showed a punctate pattern of _PROTEIN_ that is typical for _LOCATION_ targeted proteins . the size and shape of the _METHOD_ signal in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ leaves was identical to that observed in the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ line . staining of root tissue with mito tracker orange showed that the _METHOD_ fluorescing structures are distinct from mitochondria . these results indicate that the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein is targeted to _LOCATION_ . identification of _PROTEIN_ related genes that are induced by wounding and capacity of _PROTEIN_ mutants to accumulate of wt levels of ja in wounded leaves indicates that additional enzymes are involved in the activation of ja precursors . other like genes that have an _PROTEIN_ pattern similar to _PROTEIN_ can be considered good candidates for this function . results presented in fig . show that two like genes are not induced by mechanical wounding . we used rna blot analysis and gene specific probes to assess the _PROTEIN_ pattern of four additional members of this group namely _GENE_ and _GENE_ . and transcripts were not detected in either undamaged or wounded leaves of wt plants . in contrast and _GENE_ mrna accumulation was induced both by wounding and ja treatment . the time course of _PROTEIN_ of these two inducible genes was similar to that of _PROTEIN_ . in summary these results indicate that three members _PROTEIN_ of the like gene family are _PROTEIN_ in leaves in response to wounding and ja treatment .
