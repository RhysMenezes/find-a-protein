cytokinins are hormones that regulate cell division and development . as a result of a lack of specific mutants and biochemical tools it has not been possible to study the consequences of cytokinin deficiency . cytokinin deficient plants are expected to yield information about processes in which cytokinins are limiting and that therefore they might regulate . we have engineered transgenic arabidopsis plants that overexpress individually six different members of the cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase gene family and have undertaken a detailed phenotypic analysis . transgenic plants had increased cytokinin breakdown and reduced _PROTEIN_ of the cytokinin reporter gene _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ . cytokinin deficiency resulted in diminished activity of the vegetative and floral shoot apical _METHOD_ and leaf primordia indicating an absolute requirement for the hormone . by contrast cytokinins are negative regulators of root growth and _PROTEIN_ root formation . we show that the increased growth of the primary root is linked to an enhanced meristematic cell number suggesting that cytokinins control the exit of cells from the root meristem . different atckx green _METHOD_ protein fusion proteins were localized to the _LOCATION_ or the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and possibly to the _LOCATION_ space indicating that subcellular compartmentation plays an important role in cytokinin biology . analyses of promoter gus fusion genes showed differential _PROTEIN_ of atckx genes during plant development the activity being confined predominantly to zones of active growth . our results are consistent with the hypothesis that cytokinins have central but opposite regulatory functions in root and shoot _METHOD_ and indicate that a fine tuned control of catabolism plays an important role in ensuring the proper regulation of cytokinin functions .
to explore the consequences of _PROTEIN_ cytokinin content we transformed arabidopsis with individual atckx genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of the constitutive promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus . at least independent transgenic lines that showed phenotypes similar to those described below were obtained for each construct . the phenotypic changes were qualitatively similar for all genes but overexpression of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ resulted in stronger changes than overexpression of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . most quantitative phenotypic analyses were performed with homozygotic progeny of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . all lines showed strong alterations typical of the two phenotypic classes . detailed analyses were performed with plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ and/or _PROTEIN_ as representatives of their respective classes . fewer quantitative data are available for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants . however they all showed _METHOD_ typical of cytokinin deficiency indicating that all six analyzed genes encode functional products . rna gel blot analyses showed that driven gene _PROTEIN_ enhanced the endogenous steady state mrna level of each atckx gene _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . callus derived from transgenic and wild type root tissue was analyzed for the levels of _PROTEIN_ activity using ip as a substrate . all transgenic lines showed a to fold increase in _PROTEIN_ activity compared with the wild type . the greatest increases were found in calli overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes whereas _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ overexpressers had only up to threefold the wild type activity . similarly a threefold to fivefold enhancement of _PROTEIN_ activity was found in leaves of _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants compared with wild type plants . the apparent km values for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ enzymes extracted from transgenic callus tissue were between and whereas the apparent km of _PROTEIN_ was significantly greater . interestingly _PROTEIN_ showed a considerably lower maximum velocity than the other atckx proteins indicating that the enzyme has a lower turnover capacity at least with ip as a substrate . the endogenous cytokinin content was determined for two independent _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transgenic clones . in shoots harvested days after germination most of the eight different cytokinin metabolites analyzed were reduced significantly compared with wild type tissue . z derived metabolites are the predominant cytokinins of arabidopsis their concentration being approximately twofold greater than that of ip derivatives . the more abundant z cytokinins were more strongly reduced than were ip cytokinins . the total content of the measured ip and z metabolites in individual transgenic clones ranged between and of wild type concentrations . interestingly the overall changes in cytokinin content as well as the metabolic spectra were similar for both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ overexpressers although there are apparent differences in the _PROTEIN_ of phenotypic traits between these transgenic lines . the concentration of dihydrozeatin type cytokinins was either very low or below the detection limit in both wild type and transgenic seedlings . the activity of hormone reporter genes reflects both hormone content and hormone sensitivity . _PROTEIN_ is a response regulator gene of the two component system that is transcriptionally upregulated by cytokinin . to investigate whether the reduction in the endogenous cytokinin content was reflected by changes in the _PROTEIN_ of a cytokinin response gene we analyzed _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the transgenic background . _PROTEIN_ gus activity was reduced strongly during various developmental stages of _PROTEIN_ plants . the reduction was more severe in the shoot than in the root . at dag _PROTEIN_ gus activity was completely absent in the shoot apical meristem of _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants whereas in the root meristem the signal was weaker but still detectable . a similar but somewhat weaker reduction was observed at _PROTEIN_ stages of development . the reporter gene assay _METHOD_ the results of the hormonal measurements and indicates that the reduction in cytokinin content was not or not fully compensated for by an increase in sensitivity but that the plant reacted with a sustained reduction of the cytokinin response system . moreover the reduction in _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ suggests that altered or reduced signaling through the two component system may be involved causally in the phenotypic changes in the transgenic plants . cytokinins frequently act in conjunction with other hormonal signals . interactions between cytokinin and auxin have been described as occurring at multiple levels including mutual regulation at the level of active hormone . cytokinin overproducing tobacco plants have been shown to contain lower levels of free indole acetic acid and reduced rates of iaa synthesis and turnover . it was suggested that cytokinins act as downregulators of iaa and vice versa . in contrast to this hypothesis the levels of iaa were reduced significantly to to and to of the wild type content in plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . this finding does not necessarily indicate a direct regulation of auxin metabolism by cytokinins . for example it is possible that the different tissue composition in transgenic plants leads to a lower proportion of auxin producing tissue . cytokinin deficiency caused pleiotropic developmental changes during all phases of the growth cycle . in shoots a retardation of development was noticeable soon after germination . the formation of new rosette leaves was delayed throughout vegetative growth in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants but not in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants . in of the seedlings of homozygotic strong _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ shoot growth stopped completely at the two to four leaf stage . leaf formation and flowering in atckx transgenic plants in tandem with these phenotypical alterations were distinct histological differences of atckx transgenic shoot tissues . the morphology of the vegetative sam was examined in longitudinal sections of wild type and _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants at dag . _PROTEIN_ overexpression resulted in a strong reduction of the diameter and height of the meristem which was attributable _PROTEIN_ to fewer meristematic cells _PROTEIN_ but also to the significantly _PROTEIN_ size of the meristematic cells . unlike the quantitative parameters the typical regular structure and organization of the sam were not altered in _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants . in addition to the slower formation of primordia leaf expansion was reduced strongly in transgenic plants . rosette leaves expanded more slowly than wild type leaves until they reached their final size and unlike wild type leaves the leaves of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants continued to expand significantly after the transition to flowering . figure shows that at the end of the vegetative growth phase the surface area of leaves from the _PROTEIN_ rosette was to of the wild type area for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants and to of the wild type area for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants . to examine whether the differences in leaf size were caused by a reduced cell number or by changes in cell expansion we determined the cell density of wild type and _PROTEIN_ transgenic leaves . the number of epidermal cells per square unit was counted on the abaxial surface of the seventh fully expanded rosette leaf in the center between the midvein and the leaf margin . the cells of _PROTEIN_ leaves were slightly enlarged showing that the reduced leaf size was primarily the result of a _PROTEIN_ cell number . leaves of atckx transgenic plants showed no earlier onset of senescence either in intact plants or in detached leaves that were kept in the dark . transverse sections through the central part of the fully developed seventh leaf showed that fewer cells were formed in the dorsoventral direction and that the extent of intercellular air spaces between blade mesophyll cells was greater than that in wild type leaves . in addition a lower number of xylem and phloem cells resulted in a _PROTEIN_ in the diameter of vascular bundles in _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants . a comparison of the vascular pattern as visualized in whole mount preparations of cleared leaves showed that the leaf vasculature in _PROTEIN_ leaves was reduced greatly compared with that in wild type leaves . the number and spatial density of veins of higher order _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ . the reduced size of the sam together with the retarded leaf formation and reduced cell production in the leaves provides evidence that cytokinins are required as a positive regulator of cell division activity in the arabidopsis shoot . under long day conditions the onset of flowering in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants was delayed by up to weeks compared with that in the wild type but it was unaffected in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ overexpressers . however the developmental timing of the floral transition was affected minimally or not at all because both wild type and transgenic plants initiated flowering after producing approximately the same number of rosette leaves . occasionally _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants did not flower but either remained in the vegetative stage or eventually died . during the prolonged reproductive phase and after the initiation of flowering _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants formed more axillary branches than did wild type plants indicating _PROTEIN_ apical dominance . this is the opposite effect of what was expected from _PROTEIN_ cytokinin content . this phenotypic trait may be the result of the _PROTEIN_ activity of the shoot apex which leads to _PROTEIN_ auxin production . the axillary rosettes acquired the size of the _PROTEIN_ rosette giving the plant a somewhat bushy appearance . the plants formed thin inflorescence _METHOD_ that bent downward . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants formed very few flowers on each single inflorescence stem indicating that the capability of apical inflorescence _METHOD_ to form new flower primordia was reduced . the structure morphology and size of the flowers were similar to those of the wild type . we examined the cell size and cell number in the distal portion of the _PROTEIN_ epidermis . these cells have been shown to be diploid and uniform in size and shape . we found that fully mature _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ had fewer cells per square unit than wild type _PROTEIN_ and that the cells were larger than normal . this finding suggests that fewer cells were produced per organ . however the transgenic flowers reached the wild type size because the larger _PROTEIN_ cells compensated for the _PROTEIN_ in cell numbers . the fertility of flowers was diminished strongly . the first flowers did not form any pollen . flowers formed _PROTEIN_ produced a small amount of pollen and were able to self fertilize . approximately to viable seeds were in the siliques of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants whereas wild type siliques harbor up to seeds . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ siliques were not filled completely seeds in one silique matured unequally and some aborted during development . interestingly the mature viable seeds of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transgenic clones were enlarged . their weight was approximately two times the wild type weight . a similar enlargement was observed for transgenic embryos which was attributable to increases in both cell number and cell size . it is not clear whether this finding suggests a role for cytokinins during embryogenesis or whether other _PROTEIN_ such as the reduced seed set are involved in producing the increased seed _METHOD_ . to summarize the reproductive development of cytokinin deficient plants indicates that cytokinins regulate meristem activity and also limit cell formation in developing organs during the reproductive phase of development . in contrast to the retarded shoot development the root growth of atckx transgenic arabidopsis plants was enhanced . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings grown for days under in vitro conditions had primary roots whose rates of elongation were to and to greater than that of wild type seedlings respectively . the increase in primary root length for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ overexpressing seedlings was less pronounced . additionally the formation of _PROTEIN_ and adventitious roots was enhanced strongly . the number of initiated _PROTEIN_ and adventitious roots in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants was up to seven times greater than that of the wild type . moreover the _PROTEIN_ root primordia in these transgenic clones often were initiated in much closer proximity than those in wild type plants . a significant increase of adventitious root formation but not of _PROTEIN_ roots was observed in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transgenic seedlings . as a result the length of the total root system increased up to three times in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants and times in plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . these results suggest that cytokinins are involved in controlling both root growth rate and the generation of new root _METHOD_ . wild type _PROTEIN_ root growth showed an acropetal developmental gradient . longer _PROTEIN_ roots were positioned closer to the root hypocotyl junction leading to a cone like structure of the root system . this developmental pattern was altered in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants in which _PROTEIN_ roots of different lengths were distributed randomly . this finding suggests that in the transgenic plants the _PROTEIN_ root primordia were not initiated sequentially in the acropetal direction or that the growth rate of individual _PROTEIN_ roots differed from one to the other . to address the question of whether the altered root growth was associated with changes in morphology and/or tissue pattern we analyzed root sections of _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants and compared them with those of wild type plants . longitudinal sections revealed that the _PROTEIN_ primary root apical meristem was enlarged in both the longitudinal and _PROTEIN_ directions and that the number of cells in the ram was increased . however the overall regular structure of the root meristem was _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants . transverse sections through the mature root revealed an increased number or size of cells in some cell files . whereas the wild type epidermis was composed of to cell files the _PROTEIN_ transgenic root contained between and epidermal cell files . similarly the _PROTEIN_ root contained to endodermal files unlike the wild type endodermis which was composed invariably of cell files . by contrast the number of cortex cells was identical in wild type and transgenic roots . because both cortex and endodermis cell files originate from the same initials this finding suggests that the extra endodermal cell files were formed after the basic radial pattern was established . indeed extra divisions of endodermal cells were visible within the meristematic region of transgenic roots supporting the notion that additional cell files did not originate from an increased number of the corresponding initial cells . moreover an increased radial expansion of all cell types including xylem and phloem cells resulted in an increased root diameter in _PROTEIN_ plants . in contrast to the changes in the radial root organization cell numbers and cell sizes were not altered in most outer tissues of the hypocotyl . it is noteworthy that the lower number of vascular cells in _PROTEIN_ transgenic hypocotyls is reminiscent of the reduced vasculature in the shoot part . to investigate the mechanism by which _PROTEIN_ cytokinin content increases the root elongation rate we examined the roots of _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants in detail . to examine the pattern of mitotic activity in the root _METHOD_ we analyzed the activity of a _PROTEIN_ gus fusion gene in the transgenic background . owing to a mitotic degradation signal in the protein reporter gene activity marks only actively dividing cells . at dag the primary root length of _PROTEIN_ seedlings was greater than that of the wild type . the number of dividing meristematic cells as visualized by _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ was increased from in wild type roots to in _PROTEIN_ transgenic roots . the length of the cell division zone defined here by the most distally stained mitotic cells was increased from in the wild type to in _PROTEIN_ . the volume of the ram and the number of mitotic cells was estimated to be proportionally larger . thus the number of dividing cells per ram volume unit was not changed significantly in _PROTEIN_ plants . the length of mature cortical cells was increased slightly in _PROTEIN_ plants . however this increase was small compared with the increase in root elongation rate . therefore the enhanced root growth in _PROTEIN_ plants was attributed largely to the increased number of dividing cells in the ram . this result suggests that cytokinins regulate the root growth rate by determining the number of dividing cells in the ram by controlling the exit of cells from the ram . the precise sites of cytokinin metabolism are unknown at the cellular and subcellular levels . it has been shown that specific spectra of cytokinin metabolites occur _LOCATION_ as well as in subcellular compartments such as chloroplasts . sequence analyses of atckx proteins predict different subcellular localizations and the analyses described above of atckx overexpressers indicated that the site of enhanced cytokinin degradation might be relevant to the _PROTEIN_ of the cytokinin deficiency syndrome . to contribute to a better understanding of the subcellular compartmentation of cytokinin catabolism we attempted to analyze the subcellular localizations of several atckx proteins . although different atckx proteins share low sequence identity in their n terminal regions hydropathy plots revealed a highly hydrophobic n terminal domain as a common feature of all atckx proteins suggesting the presence of n terminal target sequences . the only exception is _PROTEIN_ which was not analyzed in this work . for most of the atckx proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the cellular localization _METHOD_ targetp and ipsort predicted a short n terminal signal peptide for targeting to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and subsequent transport through the secretory pathway . the results for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were classified as highly reliable whereas the _PROTEIN_ signal peptide prediction belonged to the lowest reliability class . however the _PROTEIN_ protein has been excreted in heterologous yeast _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . targetp predicted that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins contain mitochondria targeting peptides with and respectively . consistently ipsort predicted _PROTEIN_ to be a mitochondrial protein but _PROTEIN_ was classified as an excreted protein . moreover cleavage of the _PROTEIN_ n terminal targeting signal as predicted by targetp would partially delete the conserved flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor binding site of _PROTEIN_ which makes the targetp prediction unlikely . these partially ambiguous predictions and the _PROTEIN_ that computer _METHOD_ occasionally fail to predict subcellular localizations correctly emphasized the need for in vivo targeting experiments . we fused the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ to the c termini of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ these fusion proteins under the control of the promoter in stably transformed arabidopsis plants . transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ individual atckx _METHOD_ fusion genes phenocopied the corresponding atckx overexpressing lines indicating that the fusion proteins were functional . as controls we used plants _PROTEIN_ either _METHOD_ alone or _METHOD_ with an n terminal mitochondrial target sequence _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the _METHOD_ distribution was monitored in abaxial epidermal leaf cells and in root cells using confocal microscopy . in control plants _PROTEIN_ untargeted _METHOD_ the _METHOD_ signal showed the typical distribution in _LOCATION_ in cytoplasm displaced to the cell periphery by the large central _LOCATION_ and in transvacuolar cytoplasmic strands in young leaf epidermal cells . the _METHOD_ protein targeted to mitochondria accumulated in discrete _METHOD_ particles distributed in the cytoplasm . in comparison optical sections through the center of cells revealed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ to be distributed as a thin more or less discontinuous line at the cell periphery and around _LOCATION_ . in an optical section at the level of the cortex cytoplasm the _METHOD_ appeared as a reticulate polygonal network often linked with punctuated structures . based on published data this distinct pattern can be identified as indicating localization to the _LOCATION_ . the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was supported further by the visualization of motile spindle shaped _METHOD_ bodies in the epidermis of petioles . these structures were shown previously to reside within the lumen of the _LOCATION_ and are typically seen in arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ both _LOCATION_ retained and secreted _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ . considering that _PROTEIN_ does not contain a consensus h/kdel _LOCATION_ retrieval motif it is conceivable that the protein was finally secreted . however we have no experimental proof for this assumption besides the accumulation of _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ enzymatic activity in yeast . in contrast to the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ staining pattern epidermal leaf cells of plants _PROTEIN_ high levels of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulated _METHOD_ in the large central _LOCATION_ . the uniformly stained _LOCATION_ was surrounded at the periphery by small highly _METHOD_ particles that may represent intermediate transport compartments . additionally the _LOCATION_ like _METHOD_ network was observed in peripheral confocal sections indicating that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ entered the _LOCATION_ lumen and was directed subsequently from the default secretory pathway to the _LOCATION_ . the _LOCATION_ associated _METHOD_ was detected in most of the leaf epidermal cells but strong _LOCATION_ staining was confined to only a small number of cells . this might be the result of the large volume of _LOCATION_ requiring high levels of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ for visualization or of the fusion protein being rapidly turned over by _LOCATION_ proteases . _LOCATION_ targeting of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was confirmed in root tissue in which _METHOD_ was localized to central _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and small _METHOD_ particles in different cell types . like _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion marked the _LOCATION_ network in leaf epidermal cells but it was not detected in _LOCATION_ . however _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected in _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ smaller root cells such as those of the vascular cylinder . this finding suggests that _LOCATION_ targeting of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ might be specific to certain cell types or more likely that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ level was lower and thus stained only smaller _LOCATION_ . together these data support the conclusion that the final destination of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is the _LOCATION_ . to gain further information about the individual roles of the atckx genes during plant development we studied their _PROTEIN_ patterns using promoter gus fusion genes . the _PROTEIN_ promoter drove gene _PROTEIN_ in the shoot apex _PROTEIN_ shoot _METHOD_ and growing tissues of young flowers . in roots _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ was localized in close proximity to the vascular cylinder at the site of growing _PROTEIN_ roots . gus activity gradually increased with the increasing elongation of _PROTEIN_ roots . weak _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ was detected at the root hypocotyl junction . gus activity disappeared in roots when the _PROTEIN_ promoter fragment was shortened to bp indicating the presence of the regulatory cis element between positions and . _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ promoter was detected in the shoot apex in _PROTEIN_ and occasionally in the most apical part of inflorescence _METHOD_ . no gus activity was observed in roots . of the analyzed _PROTEIN_ gus transformants in which gus _PROTEIN_ was driven by a kb promoter fragment we occasionally detected very weak _PROTEIN_ in the young shoot tissues weeks after germination . high _PROTEIN_ gus activity was localized to trichomes which are polyploid . according to the basipetal developmental pattern of trichomes in the growing leaves the strongest gus activity was associated with developing trichomes in the basal part of expanding leaves and it gradually _PROTEIN_ in maturing trichomes toward the distal end of the leaves . a similar basipetal staining gradient was observed in developing stomata of young growing leaves . the greatest gus activity was present in stomatal meristemoids and their clonally related cells and ceased during the differentiation of guard cells . faint gus staining was present in epidermal pavement cells . very strong _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ was detected in _PROTEIN_ organs shown to consist of endoreduplicating cells . hence the activity of the _PROTEIN_ promoter is linked to the mitotic and endoreduplicating cells of the vegetative arabidopsis shoot . in roots _PROTEIN_ gus was _PROTEIN_ highly and specifically in the root cap . it was first detectable in the very tip of the radicle after its emergence . gus activity extended progressively in the basal direction as the _PROTEIN_ root columella expanded . at this developmental stage gus activity was very high being detectable after a few minutes of staining in the outermost layer of the root cap . even after staining for h the root meristem proper was not stained and the stained area remained restricted to the root cap . a similar staining pattern was observed during _PROTEIN_ root development . the onset of gene _PROTEIN_ occurred after the complete emergence of the root primordia . in the shoot _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ was confined to the edges at the most basal part of the youngest leaves specifically marking the developing leaf petiole . furthermore it was detected in the rib zone of the axillary shoot _METHOD_ . this _PROTEIN_ was associated with the growing axillary shoots rather than with the dormant buds because the gus activity was first detected soon after bolting . the number of stained axillary _METHOD_ increased when apical dominance was reduced by removing the _PROTEIN_ apex . during flower development _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ was detected in young developing stamen primordia and _PROTEIN_ became confined to the central part of growing anthers . before and during pollination _PROTEIN_ was restricted to the maturing pollen grains . in the primary root the _PROTEIN_ promoter was active in the vascular cylinder within the ram . from the center of the meristem including the initial cells proximal to the quiescent center gus activity _PROTEIN_ gradually approaching the elongation zone and it was only faintly detectable in the differentiated root . in _PROTEIN_ roots _PROTEIN_ followed the same pattern . gus activity was detectable in the center of _PROTEIN_ root primordia from developmental stage v onward . _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ was localized primarily to the vascular system of developing cotyledons leaves and roots . gus activity was strongest in the vasculature of young growing leaves . it gradually _PROTEIN_ basipetally in older leaves and was undetectable in fully expanded leaves . likewise _PROTEIN_ was detected only in the vascular bundles in the most apical portion of the growing stem . in addition the _PROTEIN_ promoter was active during the maturation phase of stomatal guard cells but not in fully mature stomata in older leaves suggesting that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plays a role in stomatal development rather than in stomatal function . in the root vasculature gus activity was detectable soon after germination with localized maxima forming around the _PROTEIN_ root primordia . _PROTEIN_ in development the _PROTEIN_ expanded equally throughout the whole root vascular cylinder but did not reach the ram . in flowers _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ was confined to the vascular bundles and transmitting tissue of developing gynoeciae . when the ovules developed gus activity became visible in funiculi .
binary plasmids harboring the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes under the control of a promoter have been described . numbering of atckx genes was according to their appearance in the database as described by citation . the genomic sequences of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes were amplified from dna of arabidopsis thaliana columbia using the following primers ggggtaccttgatgaatcgtgaaatgac and ggggtaccctttcctcttggttttgtcctgt for _PROTEIN_ and cccgggtcaggaaaagaaccatgcttatag and cccgggtcatgagtatgagactgccttttg for _PROTEIN_ . the resulting gene fragments were cloned into pbinhygtx downstream of the promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus . to obtain promoter gus fusion genes the promoter sequences of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes were amplified by pcr from dna of arabidopsis col . primers were as follows _PROTEIN_ promoter gctctagaaaatgctctgttatcaatgtgtc and gctcccgggctactttgttgagagaaattgca _PROTEIN_ promoter gcgtcgaccattcctcaaccaatatctgcaac and gctctagatatgtttctctctctctctgatttg _PROTEIN_ promoter gcgtcgaccaaagtttggcctacgattgtt and gctctagagcttgattcttatcaatgaagagtag _PROTEIN_ promoter cccaagcttcggttattttatgggccagtt and cccaagcttaacaaacgggtaggttaatgg _PROTEIN_ promoter aagcttatcgacaaagagcaaattatgaa and tctagagaaacaagaatcaagattgagga and _PROTEIN_ promoter aagcttcttcaagtggaccgtttatctct and cccgggataaggcctcttgatttctgaga . the lengths of the amplified sequences were bp _PROTEIN_ bp _PROTEIN_ bp _PROTEIN_ bp _PROTEIN_ bp _PROTEIN_ and bp _PROTEIN_ . all promoter sequences were inserted into vector pgptv bar upstream of the gus reading frame . dideoxy sequencing of the amplified dna fragments was performed with an abi prism bigdye terminator cycle sequencing reaction kit _METHOD_ to exclude pcr and cloning _LOCATION_ . soluble modified _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was amplified with primers ggggtacccgggtctagactagtctcgagtatgagtaaaggagaagaacttttcactgga and gcgtcgacttaagagctcgggcccttatttgtatagttcatccatgccatgt from _METHOD_ creating kpni smai xbai spei and xhoi linker sequences at the end and apai saci and sali linker sequences at the end . the amplified fragment was inserted downstream of the promoter in the unique kpni and sali of pbinhygtx yielding the vector _METHOD_ . to generate the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ reporter plasmid the _PROTEIN_ stop codon was mutated in the initial _PROTEIN_ construct by exchanging a nucleotide kpni fragment at the end . the mutated full length _PROTEIN_ genomic fragment was fused via the xhoi site to the n terminal end of the _METHOD_ coding region in the vector _METHOD_ . a c terminally truncated bp genomic fragment of the _PROTEIN_ gene was subcloned from vector _PROTEIN_ and added to vector _METHOD_ as an n terminal fusion to _METHOD_ via the kpni and smai sites generating the plasmid _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . a xhoi site bp upstream of the _PROTEIN_ stop codon was used to excise a kpni xhoi _PROTEIN_ genomic fragment from plasmid pbs _PROTEIN_ and to generate an n terminal fusion with _METHOD_ in the plasmid _METHOD_ yielding the vector _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . seeds of arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ the mitochondrially localized _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein were a kind gift of d.c. logan . the protein sequence analyses were performed using targetp version and ipsort . arabidopsis col plants were transformed according to the flower dip method . transgenic atckx containing progeny were selected after surface sterilization of seeds on _METHOD_ medium containing mg/l hygromycin . arabidopsis plants containing promoter gus fusions were selected on soil days after sowing by spraying once with _PROTEIN_ . plants were cultured in vitro on _METHOD_ medium under h h dark cycles at . growth conditions in a glasshouse were to and h h dark cycles . all phenotypic characterizations were performed with homozygous progeny obtained by self fertilizing . callus material for _PROTEIN_ enzymatic measurements was induced from root explants and _PROTEIN_ on _METHOD_ medium containing mg/l naphthylacetic acid and mg/l kinetin . transgenic plants that were used as a source for callus material looked similar to the transformants shown in figures and . total rna was extracted from leaf tissue according to citation . rna gel blot analysis with of total rna from transgenic plants was performed essentially as described . the lowest stringency wash after hybridization with gene specific probes covering the full gene length was performed in ssc and _PROTEIN_ at . the filters were rehybridized to a rdna specific probe as a loading control . frozen plant samples were ground in liquid nitrogen transferred into bieleski solution and extracted overnight at . for iaa analysis pmol of iaa was added to the sample before centrifugation . for each cytokinin compound determined pmol of dihydrozeatin dihydrozeatin riboside dihydrozeatin _PROTEIN_ dihydrozeatin riboside _PROTEIN_ adenine adenosine adenine _PROTEIN_ and adenosine monophosphate was added . the pellet was resuspended for h at in methanol and centrifuged once more . the supernatants of both fractions were pooled and dried . after dissolving in water cytokinins were purified by a combination of solid phase and immunoaffinity chromatography as described by citation . after the immunoaffinity treatment iaa was concentrated on a cartridge and methylated before analyses . hormones were quantified by micro liquid chromatography positive electrospray tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in multiple reactant monitoring mode . the _METHOD_ obtained were processed by means of _METHOD_ software _METHOD_ . concentrations were calculated according to the principles of isotope dilution and _PROTEIN_ in picomoles per gram fresh weight . the assay of _PROTEIN_ activity was based on the conversion of ip to adenine as described elsewhere . the reaction mixture contained mm { amino } propanesulfonic acid naoh buffer ph ip and enzyme preparations equivalent to to mg of fresh tissue in a total volume of . after incubation at the reaction was stopped by the addition of of mm adenine and ip in cold ethanol and of mm . precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation and adenine and ip were separated by thin layer chromatography on microcrystalline cellulose plates developed with the upper phase of a mixture of ethyl acetate n propanol water . the radioactivity of adenine and ip containing zones was determined by liquid scintillation using the packard _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tr scintillation counter . the apparent km and maximum velocity values of _PROTEIN_ preparations were determined in the same assay mixture described above with ip as the substrate used in the concentration range of to . the apparent km and maximum velocity values were calculated on the basis of a lineweaver burk double reciprocal plot of _PROTEIN_ activity as a function of ip concentration . histochemical analysis of the gus reporter enzyme was performed essentially according to citation as modified by citation . sample tissues were fixed in ice cold acetone for h and incubated for to h in reaction buffer . after staining seedlings were cleared and mounted according to citation . endogenous pigments were destained with ethanol and the gus staining pattern was recorded with a stereomicroscope or a microscope equipped with an olympus c photographic device . for sectioning plant tissue was fixed and embedded in lr white according to citation and thin sections were stained with toluidine blue . tissue for the observation of vasculature was cleared and visualized as described by citation . transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ individual _METHOD_ fusion constructs were selected according to their phenotype and preanalyzed using an _METHOD_ microscope before the confocal imaging . primary leaves or roots were cut and mounted in water for microscopic observation . the subcellular localization of _METHOD_ fusion proteins was analyzed with a zeiss clsm confocal laser scanning microscope using a c apochromat w korr water immersion objective and a nm argon laser in combination with a to nm bandpass filter set . image acquisition and processing were performed using a zeiss laser scanning microscope software and adobe photoshop _METHOD_ . upon request materials integral to the findings presented in this publication will be made available in a timely manner to all investigators on similar _METHOD_ for noncommercial research purposes . to obtain materials please contact thomas tschmue { at } zedat.fu
