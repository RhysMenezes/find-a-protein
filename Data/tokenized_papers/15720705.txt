transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ either green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ dna or _METHOD_ fusions have been used as powerful tools to define the subcellular localization of many proteins . because most plant cells are highly vacuolated the _LOCATION_ is confined to a thin layer at the periphery of the cells making it very difficult to distinguish among cell wall cell _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ proteins . plasmolysis tests inform about localization of _METHOD_ proteins but they do not discriminate between its cell _LOCATION_ and/or cytoplasmic localization . by observing the _METHOD_ signal in transgenic protoplasts placed at a hypotonic solution it was possible to distinguish between cell _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ proteins . the osmotic disruption of the protoplast _LOCATION_ in the hypotonic solution allows the diffusion of the _METHOD_ signal from the cell periphery to the central part of the cell volume when the _METHOD_ is fused to a soluble protein . by contrast such diffusion does not occur when the protein under study is attached to the cell _LOCATION_ . the present method is easier faster and cheaper than subcellular fractionating studies and/or immunoelectron microscopy which have been traditionally used to discern between cell _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ proteins .
in highly vacuolated cells where the _LOCATION_ is confined to a thin layer at the extreme cell periphery the present method distinguishes between cell _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ proteins by following two easy steps the mechanical isolation of the protoplasts and observation of the _METHOD_ signal during its osmotic rupture . the protoplasts isolation starts with the plasmolysis of the plant under study resulting in movement of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ away from the cell walls . this allows division of the plant into two sections by disrupting only some protoplasts . the deplasmolysis step induces the movement of the living protoplasts which facilitates its release to the external medium . this method of isolating protoplasts is a better alternative to those based on enzymatic reactions because the small number of protoplasts released which facilitates its monitoring and absence of enzymatic buffers that may induce some effects on the stability/localization of the _METHOD_ . it is important to note that observation of the _METHOD_ signal must be combined with the simultaneous visualization of the red _METHOD_ which _METHOD_ about the position of the chloroplasts in the cell volume . this allows easy inference of the moment in which the _LOCATION_ disruption takes place such a moment coincides with the beginning of the free movement of the chloroplast from the cell periphery to the central volume of the cell . two _METHOD_ cell surface proteins were used to test the efficacy of the present method caprice _PROTEIN_ and rare _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ belongs to the myb family of transcriptional _PROTEIN_ and it positively regulates root hair formation . previous studies have shown that _PROTEIN_ locates to the _LOCATION_ of root epidermal cells . _PROTEIN_ is a hydrophobic protein whose gene _PROTEIN_ is induced by cold . plants bearing either the _PROTEIN_ promoter _METHOD_ construct or a random _METHOD_ cdna fusion that solves the _PROTEIN_ protein localization showed _METHOD_ _METHOD_ at the cell surface of hypocotyl epidermal cells . the _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants as it might be expected for a putative transcriptional _PROTEIN_ also exhibited _METHOD_ . plasmolysis experiments showed that these proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ do not localize to the cell wall . plasmolysed _PROTEIN_ promoter _METHOD_ protoplasts showed the _METHOD_ signal restricted to the _LOCATION_ and to the cell surface . from to min after placing the protoplasts in a hypotonic solution the chloroplasts started to move freely along the cytoplasm because of osmotic disruption of the tonoplast . in parallel the _METHOD_ signal of the cell surface diminished because of diffusion of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the absence of the _LOCATION_ such a _METHOD_ signal was absent some seconds/minutes after _LOCATION_ disruption . a total of protoplasts were monitored and in all of them the _METHOD_ dynamic was identical . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is not targeted to the cell _LOCATION_ but that it is a soluble protein . it is likely that the localization of _METHOD_ signal in the _LOCATION_ is caused by an excess of _PROTEIN_ protein perhaps saturating its movement to the _LOCATION_ . the dynamic of _METHOD_ movement in protoplasts of the line differed from that of the _PROTEIN_ promoter _METHOD_ protoplasts . a free movement of chloroplasts from to min after placing the protoplast in a hypotonic medium was also observed in this line . by contrast the _METHOD_ signal at the cell surface did not _PROTEIN_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ protein is targeted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the osmotic disruption of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ provided _METHOD_ curves confirming such subcellular localization . proteins interact with the cell _LOCATION_ through specific sequences . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ sequences were analysed for the presence of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ segments using three _METHOD_ . the three _METHOD_ showed that the _PROTEIN_ sequence has no predicted _LOCATION_ domain . although some transcriptional _PROTEIN_ are inserted into the _LOCATION_ by interaction with other proteins thereby preventing or reducing their access to the _LOCATION_ and thus the transcription regulation of their target genes observation of the _PROTEIN_ promoter _METHOD_ protoplasts under a hypotonic medium indicated that _PROTEIN_ is not sequestrated in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the _LOCATION_ localization of the protein was identified using psort . the program which is considered the best performing transmembrane prediction program predicted two transmembrane helices between amino acids and and between amino acids and for _PROTEIN_ protein . a previous method for prediction of _LOCATION_ regions also suggested that _PROTEIN_ contains two potential transmembrane domains . the program also predicted that the region between the amino acid and locates to the cytoplasm and that the n and c terminus of the protein locates to the _LOCATION_ medium . both the hmmtop and the psort _METHOD_ also predicted two transmembrane helices for _PROTEIN_ protein . in summary the predictions through bioinformatic analysis are consistent with the presence of a fraction of soluble _PROTEIN_ and with the attachment of _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the present method provides an easy and inexpensive way to solve the subcellular localization of _METHOD_ proteins by using _METHOD_ microscopy . it then offers an interesting alternative to immunoelectron microscopy and subcellular fractionating studies which are therefore greatly restricted by the available financial and technological resources of the laboratories . the analysis of the genomic sequence of arabidopsis revealed that genes contain at least a transmembrane domain and the localization of most of them is unknown . however this might be experimentally addressed easily by using this method . this will require the availability of transgenic plants with fusions of such genes to the _METHOD_ . cutler et al . in a screen for random _METHOD_ cdna fusions isolated five arabidopsis lines showing the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ at the extreme periphery of the cell . one of them revealed the cell surface localization of _PROTEIN_ which has been studied here showing that it is attached to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the precise localization of the _METHOD_ in the remaining four lines remains unknown although the gene identity responsible for such localization suggests that the proteins encoded by them are targeted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the precise localization of such proteins can therefore be investigated using this method . because subcellular localization will become an increasingly important tool in determining the function of the many unknown proteins predicted by plant genome projects and _METHOD_ fusions are already indispensable the present method might also extend not only to arabidopsis thaliana but also to any plant species .
arabidopis plants _PROTEIN_ cell surface _METHOD_ proteins were used . plants bearing a _PROTEIN_ promoter _METHOD_ construct have been previously described . the line defining the _PROTEIN_ protein localization was identified in a random _METHOD_ cdna fusion screening . seeds were vernalized at for several days after which they were sterilized in sodium hypochlorite and plated on petri dishes containing murashige and skoog salts supplemented with sucrose and solidified with agar . seedlings were grown for d on horizontally oriented dishes at in light . transgenic plants were incubated in m _PROTEIN_ for min leading to plasmolysis . after plasmolysis plants were placed in slides and their hypocotyls were by hand using a surgical blade _PROTEIN_ . a single section was performed per hypocotyl and a total of organs of each transgenic plant _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were sectioned . after sectioning a drop of distilled water was added to the sample . this induced deplasmolysis resulting in the expansion and release of the protoplasts from the cut ends of the cells . fifteen protoplasts of each transgenic line _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were monitored from its release to its osmotic disruption studying in each the dynamic of _METHOD_ localization . the _METHOD_ of the _METHOD_ was observed with a dmirb inverted leica tcs confocal microscope _METHOD_ using a nm laser line of an argon laser with the emission window set at nm . the plant _METHOD_ was also visualized by setting the emission window at nm . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ acquisition were performed simultaneously using either a pl fluotar objective or a pl apo oil immersion objective . either optical sectioning along all cells to capture the entire _METHOD_ signals or single sections were performed depending of the samples . when the _METHOD_ signals were captured along all cells the sections were overlaid in a single image . images were recorded with picture size of pixels arranged and labelled using adobe photoshop . both _PROTEIN_ protein and _PROTEIN_ protein were analysed for the presence of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ segments using psort and servers .
