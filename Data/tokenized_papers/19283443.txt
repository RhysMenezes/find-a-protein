in a functional genomic screen performed by combining an arabidopsis yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fused complementary dna library rat fibroblasts as host and automatic microscopy we found a short protein with a predictable trans _LOCATION_ domain encoded on chromosome . in rat fibroblasts its pattern of distribution was to various organelle like structures . from the databases we learned that it has another family member in arabidopsis and homologs in several other plants chlamydomonas and fungi with a highly conserved n terminal region . we named this protein from arabidopsis short _LOCATION_ protein . no smp homologs were found in mammalian sequence databases . when the full length cdnas of _PROTEIN_ was fused to _METHOD_ under the promoter comparable distribution was observed in nicotiana benthamiana leaves suggesting an unknown evolutionarily conserved localization signal . similar localization was observed when _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana leaves under the control of its own regulatory sequences . colocalization studies with green _METHOD_ protein and red _METHOD_ protein chimeras revealed its colocalization with chloroplasts _LOCATION_ and mitochondria . no localization of _PROTEIN_ was observed in the _LOCATION_ . immunostaining with specific antibodies corroborated the _PROTEIN_ localization to the three organelles .
when screening the arabidopsis cdna library in mammalian cells we isolated a cdna clone that labeled different organelles in rat embryonic fibroblasts . sequencing the isolated cdna revealed it to be _GENE_ an unknown short protein that had been previously found in a pool of mitochondrial _LOCATION_ proteins . _GENE_ has an additional unknown close homolog from arabidopsis _GENE_ isolated from a mitochondrial _LOCATION_ fraction . in addition orthologous genes were found from vitis vinifera _PROTEIN_ populus trichocarpa picea sitchensis and oryza sativa exhibiting to identity from physcomitrella patens with identity and from chlamydomonas reinhardtii with identity . these _METHOD_ represent dicots and monocots annuals and perennials trees and herbaceous plants and higher and lower plants suggesting an important conserved role for these proteins . several types of fungi also had orthologous genes exhibiting to identities . the annotations of the proteins from all plants and fungi were unknown whereas the homolog from chlamydomonas is annotated as a kda subunit of nadh/ubiquinone oxidoreductase . no homologous genes were found in animals . _PROTEIN_ profiles using genevestigator showed both arabidopsis genes to have constant _PROTEIN_ throughout plant development . in a comparison of their _PROTEIN_ in different tissues slightly higher levels were observed in the stamen and various root cells _PROTEIN_ . in addition the _PROTEIN_ of _GENE_ has been found to be dramatically increased in cells cultured in suspension . we checked the two unknown proteins using the arabidopsis subcellular localization database _PROTEIN_ and found that _GENE_ is predicted to localize to the mitochondria and the _LOCATION_ . the _GENE_ protein was predicted to localize to the mitochondria to the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ . the two full length arabidopsis cdnas were isolated and named _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . when _PROTEIN_ in rat fibroblasts as _METHOD_ fusions _PROTEIN_ labeled a network resembling the _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ localized to various bodies of different sizes ranging from to . when these two cdna _METHOD_ fusions were transferred to a plant _PROTEIN_ vector and transiently _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana leaves their localization pattern was very similar to the respective localization in rat fibroblasts _PROTEIN_ localized to an _LOCATION_ like network and _PROTEIN_ to different sized bodies . the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ was not corroborated by staining with specific antibodies which showed distribution pattern similar to _PROTEIN_ thus the construct could no longer be used . the similarity in localization of _PROTEIN_ in animal and plant cells suggested an evolutionarily conserved localization signal recognized in both plant and animal cells even though this protein is not normally _PROTEIN_ in the latter . to ensure that the observed subcellular localization was not an artifact of overexpression the _METHOD_ chimera of _PROTEIN_ was sub cloned downstream of its own flanking genomic sequence . this construct was coexpressed in n. benthamiana leaves together with _METHOD_ chimera of _PROTEIN_ under the regulation of the strong viral promoter . figure c shows almost identical subcellular localization of the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ chimeras with the exception of some minor red signals that were not visible in the green channel . we therefore continued our study with constructs containing _PROTEIN_ under the regulation of the promoter . we determined to which organelles _PROTEIN_ is localized in plant cells . specific markers used were _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ as a _LOCATION_ marker _METHOD_ as a mitochondrial marker and a _METHOD_ peroxisomal marker . we found no colocalization of _PROTEIN_ with the _LOCATION_ apparatus . however it did colocalize with the mitochondrial marker as predicted and shown biochemically and encircled _LOCATION_ and chloroplasts . no classical targeting signals were found using the public software prosite or smart . when _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion was made _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ the opposite of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion it formed similar pattern of localization when transiently _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana leaves . thus no interference of the _METHOD_ protein with subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ was observed . to reveal where the targeting signal is located in the protein we generated deletion mutants and fused them to _METHOD_ . a c terminal fusion was produced and two n terminus _METHOD_ fusions one with the n terminus and one with both the n terminus and the trans _LOCATION_ domain . when transiently _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana leaves all constructs showed diffuse cytoplasmic distribution . the construct containing both the n terminus and transmembrane domain occasionally formed aggregates and an _LOCATION_ like pattern . when coexpressed with the full length _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ it was found that none of the aggregates or _LOCATION_ like pattern formed by this deletion mutant colocalized with any of the organelles stained by _PROTEIN_ . this suggested that the aggregates and the _LOCATION_ like structures that randomly appeared are non relevant to the full length protein and that sequences found in all three domains are important for the correct targeting of _PROTEIN_ . specific antibody was generated against a conserved peptide from the smps . to verify its specificity total protein extracts were prepared from wild type arabidopsis plants arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ either _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and n. benthamiana leaves . in all plants an kda band was labeled corresponding to the predicted size of the smps . higher molecular weight bands were labeled in the transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the smp _METHOD_ chimeras . identical molecular weight bands were also detected by anti _METHOD_ antibodies further supporting the identity of these bands . in addition in arabidopsis an even higher molecular weight protein was labeled by the anti smp antibody . since no other homologous sequences are present in arabidopsis it is unlikely that the antibody cross reacted with non relevant proteins we can therefore not rule out the possibility that smp is part of a larger complex that is not fully unassembled by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in n. benthamiana only the small kda protein was labeled . we therefore used this antibody for in situ immunogold labeling of endogenous n. benthamiana smps . figure shows that all three organelles chloroplasts including inner _LOCATION_ mitochondria and _LOCATION_ were labeled by the anti smp antibody . counting the gold particles in the three organelles and cytoplasm showed that mitochondria stained better than chloroplasts and _LOCATION_ and that staining of all three organelles was higher than the background in the cytoplasm . however differences between the _METHOD_ patterns and the antibody labeling were revealed the chloroplast and _LOCATION_ staining looked different while the _METHOD_ signal was stronger around _LOCATION_ and chloroplasts the antibody labeled specifically chloroplasts inner _LOCATION_ and the inner part of _LOCATION_ .
