normal leaf margin development is important for leaf morphogenesis and contributes to diverse leaf shapes in higher plants . we here show the crucial roles of an atypical type ii phosphatidylinositol kinase _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis leaf margin development . _PROTEIN_ presents a dynamics _PROTEIN_ pattern along with leaf development and a t dna mutant lacking _PROTEIN_ presents serrated leaves which is resulted from the accelerated cell division and increased auxin concentration at serration tips . studies revealed that _PROTEIN_ interacts with and phosphorylates a _LOCATION_ bound nac transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . previous studies demonstrated that _LOCATION_ bound transcription _PROTEIN_ regulate gene transcription by undergoing proteolytic process to translocate into _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ undergoes proteolysis by cleaving off the transmembrane region and _PROTEIN_ terminal . western blot analysis indeed showed that _PROTEIN_ deleting of _PROTEIN_ terminal is significantly reduced in indicating that _PROTEIN_ is important for the cleavage of _PROTEIN_ . this is consistent with the subcellular localization observation showing that _METHOD_ by _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is detected at _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but not _LOCATION_ in mutant and that _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ deleting of _PROTEIN_ terminal driven by _PROTEIN_ promoter could rescue the leaf serration defects of . further analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ suppresses the auxin synthesis by directly binding and regulating the _PROTEIN_ of auxin synthesis related genes . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ to negatively regulate auxin synthesis and hence influences cell proliferation and leaf development providing informative clues for the regulation of in situ auxin synthesis and cell division as well as the cleavage and functional mechanism of _LOCATION_ bound transcription _PROTEIN_ .
structural analysis showed that arabidopsis type ii _PROTEIN_ has one _PROTEIN_ kinase domain and one ubiquitin like domain . quantitative rt pcr analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in various tissues including seedlings roots flowers leaves and _METHOD_ . further analysis by observing the transgenic lines harbouring _PROTEIN_ driven by _PROTEIN_ promoter confirmed the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in seedlings cauline leaves cotyledons sepals and fruits . detailed observation of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in adult rosette leaves revealed a varied _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in different rosette leaves relatively high in whole blade of the or leaves low at the margin of the or leaves and barely detectable in the serration of the or leaves . a. qpcr analysis revealed the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in various tissues . gene was used as an internal reference and transcription level of _PROTEIN_ in stem was set as . the experiments were repeated three times and data are presented as means _PROTEIN_ . b . promoter gus fusion analysis showed the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in young seedling cauline leaf floral tissue fruit and rosette leaves . bars mm . c. dynamic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ along with the rosette leaf development . representative images were shown . bars mm . d. in situ hybridization analysis of _PROTEIN_ mrna in rosette leaf . different regions including distal central and proximal of leaf were sectioned . bars mm . further observation of the spatial and temporal _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ along with development of the or leaves the typical adult leaves showed that different from that of leaves _PROTEIN_ transcript could be detected in the whole blade at early stage gradually reduced from the top to basal and barely detectable at the serration tip when leaves grew from cm which was confirmed by in situ rna hybridization analysis . the dynamic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ along with leaf development suggests a potential role of _PROTEIN_ in leaf morphogenesis . a putative t dna insertion mutant was identified . the t dna was inserted at the utr of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and qpcr analysis confirmed the deficient _PROTEIN_ transcription of the homozygous mutants . a. qpcr analysis of the _PROTEIN_ transcription level in wt and homozygous mutant wt or plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ driven by its own native promoter _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . gene was used as an internal reference and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in wt was set as . the experiments were repeated three times and data are presented as means _PROTEIN_ . statistical analysis was performed using a two tailed student s t test _PROTEIN_ lines compared to or _PROTEIN_ lines compared to wt . b c. phenotypic analysis of day old or day old plants which showed deep serrated leaves and curved tiny _PROTEIN_ . bars mm or cm . d. plants presented deep serrated leaves especially the and rosette leaves . the cotyledons rosette leaves and cauline leaves were shown . bars cm . e. detailed observations showed that and rosette leaves of plants exhibit highly serration along with the development and maturation under long day condition . the leaf was observed at days respectively . bars mm . f. increased serration depth of and leaves of . the depth of leaf serrations were measured using day old plants and statistically analyzed . the experiments were repeated three times and data are presented as means sd . g h complementary _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in recovered the normal leaf shape and _PROTEIN_ . representative leaf and flowers of wt _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants were shown . bars mm or mm . phenotypic observation showed that mutant has more serrated margins in adult leaves under long day or short day condition . the serrated margins were _PROTEIN_ observed in the or leaves which may result from the differential _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ in the or leaves compared to that in earlier leaves . systemic observation further revealed the altered serration along with or leaf development which was confirmed by calculation showing the increased depth of serrations and numbers of serrations in leaves . as leaf serration is a key feature of leaf shape these suggest an important role of _PROTEIN_ in normal leaf morphogenesis . in addition two or more _PROTEIN_ in one flower were observed being curved tiny or even lost under _PROTEIN_ deficiency . data are presented as means sd and statistically analyzed by student s t test . genetic analysis showed that progeny of heterozygous mutant plants display a segregation ratio indicating a single t dna insertion in the genome . by transforming the _PROTEIN_ cdna driven by its own native promoter _PROTEIN_ into mutant the recovered _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ resulted in the rescued leaf and floral development confirming the roles of _PROTEIN_ in leaf morphogenesis and margin development . in addition arabidopsis plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ do not show obvious difference in leaf and flower . studies showed that variation of the margin is mostly resulted from the altered cell proliferation in mediolateral direction or along the leaf lamina contour we therefore investigate whether _PROTEIN_ regulates the cell division at leaf margin . measurement of the leaf area of the or leaves and count of palisade cell numbers in the middle of same blade showed that there were no differences between wt and indicating that _PROTEIN_ deficiency does not lead to the altered cell division in whole adult rosette leaves . however further observation of the epidermal pavement cells at serration revealed obvious difference between wt and . in wt plants epidermal pcs at serration formed a jigsaw puzzle pattern while those at the serration tip of leaves were much smaller and without interdigitated growth . histone gene is highly _PROTEIN_ in actively dividing organ and is used as a criterion to measure the cell division rate and in situ hybridization and qpcr analysis of the gene transcription revealed the enriched mrna at leaf margin of basal and middle sections of leaves which is consistent with the increased number of pcs at serration tip . these results suggested that _PROTEIN_ deficiency resulted in the enhanced cell division rate at serration tip which leads to the abnormal leaf margins . a. plants present similar leaf area and cell numbers compared to those of wt . palisade cell numbers of same leaf area were measured and statistically analyzed . the experiments were repeated three times and data are presented as means sd . b . observation by differential interference contrast microscope and measurement revealed more epidermal cells at premature state in leaves compared to wt . the and leaves of day old plants were measured and statistically analyzed . the experiments were repeated three times and data are presented as means sd . c. in situ rna hybridization analysis and qpcr analysis confirmed the enhanced mrna level and hence the cell division at leaf serrations of . the and leaves were sectioned as distal central and proximal regions for analysis . the experiments were repeated three times . data are presented as means sd and statistically analyzed . auxin is critical for leaf margin development through regulating cell division and whether auxin accumulation was altered in was examined . gus a marker widely used for detection of auxin distribution and accumulation was transferred into through genetic crossing and analysis of the gus activity revealed the significantly increased auxin content in serration tip and upper apex of rosette leaves . measurement by liquid chromatography _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ further confirmed the increased free iaa content in the or leaves . being consistent qpcr analysis of the _PROTEIN_ of iaa synthesis related genes showed that _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ that encode key enzymes in auxin biosynthesis are obviously increased while that of _PROTEIN_ that encodes the auxin metabolism enzyme is _PROTEIN_ in the or leaves . in addition by using arabidopsis lines harbouring a gus reporter higher _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ at the leaf serrations of is confirmed . a . detection of gus activity in gus and gus lines . arrows highlight the auxin accumulation at tip of leaf serration and top of leaf . at least lines were analyzed and representative images were shown . cotyledon rosette leaf and rosette leaf of whole plant are shown . bars mm . b. quantification analysis by _METHOD_ revealed the increased iaa amount in the and rosette leaves of . _LOCATION_ bars represent sd and statistical analysis was performed by using a two tailed student s t test . c. qpcr analysis of the transcription levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the and rosette leaves of wt and . _PROTEIN_ level of the corresponding examined genes in wt was set as . the experiments were repeated three times and data are presented as means _PROTEIN_ . statistical analysis was performed by using a two tailed student s t test . d. analysis of wt or seedlings _PROTEIN_ gus revealed the much higher _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ at leaf serrations . the rosette leaf was observed and representative images were shown . bars mm . e f. treatment by iaa biosynthesis inhibitor l kynurenine or yucasin _PROTEIN_ recovered the leaf serration of . wt and seedlings were grown on _METHOD_ medium supplemented with l kyn or yucasin for days and rosette leaf was observed . representative images were shown . bars mm . consistent with the increased auxin content at tip of rosette leaves treatment with l kynurenine _PROTEIN_ and yucasin _PROTEIN_ resulted in the reduced auxin content and subdued serration at leaf margin further demonstrating that the highly serrated leaf margins in was caused by increased auxin content at tip of rosette leaves . to study the mechanism how _PROTEIN_ regulates the in situ auxin biosynthesis and hence the leaf margin development yeast two hybrid screening was performed using whole _PROTEIN_ protein as bait to identify the interacting proteins/candidate substrates of _PROTEIN_ . of the obtained positive clones two of them encode fragments of _PROTEIN_ a _LOCATION_ bound transcription _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction was confirmed by examining the gal activity and further firefly luciferase complementation assay in planta . in addition transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins in arabidopsis protoplasts showed that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ partially co localize with each other at cell _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . a. _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ in yeast cells . yeast cells co transformed with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were diluted and times and grown on synthetic dropout medium lacking leu trp his and ade supplemented with x gal . growth of cells was observed after transformation for days and yeast cells co transformed with _PROTEIN_ and empty were used as negative control . b. firefly luciferase complementation assay confirmed the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction in planta . c. transient _PROTEIN_ analysis showed that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ co localizes with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts . bar . d. _PROTEIN_ phosphorylates _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in vitro . recombinantly _PROTEIN_ his _PROTEIN_ his _PROTEIN_ his _PROTEIN_ and his _PROTEIN_ were used for kinase assay . anti his and anti pthr antibodies were used to detect the protein input and phosphorylated proteins respectively . e. western blot analysis revealed that _PROTEIN_ amount was significantly reduced in . the and rosette leaves of wt or plants _PROTEIN_ cmyc _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were used for protein extraction and western blot analysis . a mouse cmyc antibody was used to detect the cmyc _PROTEIN_ or cmyc _PROTEIN_ proteins . cbb staining indicated the equal protein loading . f. _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ driven by _PROTEIN_ promoter rescued the leaf serration of while full _PROTEIN_ could not . the rosette leaf was shown . bars cm . g. _METHOD_ observation revealed the _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of wt protoplasts while only in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but not _LOCATION_ of protoplasts . serration of the and rosette leaves of day old wt or plants were used for protoplast preparation . bar . considering that three type ii _PROTEIN_ members _PROTEIN_ are serine/threonine protein kinases it is supposed that _PROTEIN_ might function as a protein kinase to phosphorylate and regulate the target proteins . we then investigated whether _PROTEIN_ could phosphorylate _PROTEIN_ . in vitro phosphorylation assay using anti phospho threonine antibody revealed that _PROTEIN_ exhibits protein kinase activity and directly phosphorylates _PROTEIN_ . previous studies showed that _LOCATION_ bound nac precursors undergo proteolytic cleavage of tm and c terminus to translocate into _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ might form three distinct polypeptides the full _LOCATION_ bound form the _LOCATION_ form deletion of transmembrane region _PROTEIN_ and the _LOCATION_ form deletion of c terminus _PROTEIN_ . further in vitro phosphorylation assay showed that _PROTEIN_ could phosphorylate _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ which confirmed _PROTEIN_ a substrate of _PROTEIN_ and phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ occurs at the c terminus and suggested that _PROTEIN_ may involve in the regulation of _PROTEIN_ cleavage and translocation to _LOCATION_ . indeed by transforming cmyc _PROTEIN_ fusion protein into wt or western blot assay showed that compared to wt much less _PROTEIN_ is detected in suggesting the proteolytic process of cmyc _PROTEIN_ is largely suppressed . interestingly _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ driven by _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ in could rescue the highly serrated leaf while _PROTEIN_ of full _PROTEIN_ driven by _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ not confirming the important role of _PROTEIN_ on normal function of _PROTEIN_ . being consistent additional observation of the localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in wt or mutant showed that the _METHOD_ was detected in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ in wt serration while the _METHOD_ was observed in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ only in serration of mutant indicating the presence of full _LOCATION_ bound form of _PROTEIN_ in and further demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ is required for _PROTEIN_ cleavage and proteolytic activation . previous studies showed that _PROTEIN_ regulates flavonoid biosynthesis under high light and our preliminary analysis revealed that similar to _PROTEIN_ mutant genes related to flavonoid biosynthesis or transcription _PROTEIN_ regulating the _PROTEIN_ of these genes presented suppressed _PROTEIN_ in plants under high light suggesting that _PROTEIN_ may involve in flavonoid biosynthesis through regulating _PROTEIN_ . qpcr analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ is highly _PROTEIN_ in leaves and _METHOD_ . genetic analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ double mutant presented phenotype similar as demonstrating the genetic epistasis of _PROTEIN_ . by the way _PROTEIN_ mutant presents indistinguishable growth from wt and plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ has smaller rosette leaves but no serrated margins in adult leaves . as _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are increased in it is hypothesized that _PROTEIN_ might negatively regulate the auxin synthesis and cell division . indeed measurement by _METHOD_ showed the reduced auxin content in rosette leaves of plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ . further qpcr analysis confirmed the suppressed _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and increased _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the and _PROTEIN_ ox leaves . the opposite auxin content and _PROTEIN_ of auxin synthesis related genes further indicated the negative regulation of _PROTEIN_ function by _PROTEIN_ . a. qpcr analysis confirmed the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in wt _PROTEIN_ which results in the _PROTEIN_ iaa amount . gene was used as an internal reference and _PROTEIN_ transcription level in wt was set as . iaa content was measured by _METHOD_ using the and rosette leaves of day old plants . the experiments were repeated three times and statistically analyzed . data are presented as means sd . b. qpcr analysis revealed the opposite _PROTEIN_ of auxin synthesis related genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ ox and plants indicating the negative effects of _PROTEIN_ in auxin synthesis . gene was used as an internal reference and transcription level of tested gene in wt was set as . the experiments were repeated three times and statistically analyzed . data are presented as means _PROTEIN_ . c. _PROTEIN_ presents transcriptional repression activity . transient transcription dual luciferase assay was performed by using _PROTEIN_ promoter in the absence or presence of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . relative luc activities normalized to the ren activity was calculated . the experiments were repeated three times and data are presented as means sd . d. _METHOD_ assays showed that _PROTEIN_ directly binds to the promoters of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . arrows indicated the shifted bands of dna fragments . e. _PROTEIN_ assay confirmed that _PROTEIN_ directly binds to the promoters of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . qpcr was performed to detect the dna abundance . input was added as positive control and ip samples without antibody were used as negative control . _PROTEIN_ ip samples by using _METHOD_ antibody . the amplified dna abundance using pc as template was set as . the experiments were repeated three times and data are presented as means _PROTEIN_ . f. a hypothetic model how _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ module regulates auxin synthesis and leaf development . _PROTEIN_ is an important negative regulator of auxin synthesis by down regulating auxin synthesis genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ or up regulating auxin metabolism gene _PROTEIN_ . proteolysis of transmembrane region and c terminal of _PROTEIN_ results in the translocation of _PROTEIN_ into _LOCATION_ while interaction with _PROTEIN_ is crucial for _PROTEIN_ proteolysis possibly through phosphorylation to _PROTEIN_ the normal _PROTEIN_ cleavage and proper auxin levels in rosette leaves leading to the fine controlled leaf margin development and morphogenesis . in mutant defective interaction with _PROTEIN_ results in the suppressed _PROTEIN_ cleavage possible due to the reduced phosphorylation and hence enhanced auxin synthesis which leads to the promoted cell proliferation at leaf teeth and highly serrated rosette leaves . this provides a complex regulation of in situ auxin synthesis and leaf development . previous studies showed the transcriptional activation activity of _PROTEIN_ . considering that _PROTEIN_ overexpression results in the increased or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of downstream genes a dual luciferase assay using _PROTEIN_ promoter further confirmed the transcriptional repression activity of _PROTEIN_ . in addition nac transcription _PROTEIN_ might regulate the _PROTEIN_ of target genes by recognizing a core cis element cgtg in the promoter regions and predication analysis revealed the presence of one or two cgtg elements in the promoter regions of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . electrophoretic mobility shift assay _METHOD_ was then performed and results demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ could directly bind the promoter fragments of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . further chromatin immunoprecipitation _PROTEIN_ assay by using the transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein revealed the significant enrichment of the dna fragments of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ promoter regions containing cgtg elements confirming _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as the direct targets of _PROTEIN_ in planta .
