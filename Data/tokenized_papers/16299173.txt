degradation of lipid peroxides leads to the formation of cytotoxic alkenals and oxenes _PROTEIN_ . the novel nadph dependent oxidoreductase alkenal reductase _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis which is encoded by the gene _GENE_ catalyzes the reduction of the unsaturated bond of reactive _PROTEIN_ and hence is presumed to function in antioxidative defense in plants . here we show that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ has a broad substrate spectrum to biologically relevant reactive _PROTEIN_ . besides alkenals the enzyme recognized as substrates the lipid peroxide derived oxenes oxo octadeca dienoic acid and oxo octadeca dienoic acid as well as the potent genotoxin oxo nonenal altogether suggesting _PROTEIN_ has a key role in the detoxification of reactive _PROTEIN_ . to validate this conclusion by in vivo studies transgenic tobacco plants that had to fold higher _PROTEIN_ activity levels than control plants were generated . the engineered plants exhibited significantly less damage from either the exogenously administered hydroxy nonenal treatment with methyl viologen plus light or intense light . we further show that the at _PROTEIN_ protein fused with the aequorea victoria green _METHOD_ protein localizes in _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ in bright yellow cells . these results indicate that reactive _PROTEIN_ mediate photooxidative injury in leaf cells and at _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ protects the cells by reducing the unsaturated bond of the photoproduced reactive _PROTEIN_ .
the degradation of lipid peroxides in plant cells produces a variety of aldehydes and ketones . at _PROTEIN_ recognizes alkenals with _PROTEIN_ chain lengths to hexenal and oxenes which have an unsaturated enone structure . to rationalize the in vivo function of at _PROTEIN_ we further tested its substrate specificity to five derivatives of alkenals or of oxenes that are relevant to oxidative stress . at _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in e. coli was purified and its activity toward a possible electron acceptor was evaluated . kinetic parameters of recombinant at _PROTEIN_ for the lipid peroxide derived reactive _PROTEIN_ nonadienal is produced from lipid peroxides when plant tissues are wounded . this volatile dienal is a potent genotoxin that induces numerical chromosomal aberrations in mammalian cells . at _PROTEIN_ showed a high level of the nadph dependent reducing activity of nonadienal at a similar level to that of hne . we also tested another alkenal derivative oxo nonenal a potent dna modifier produced via oxidation of hne . interestingly at _PROTEIN_ showed a km value as low as and hence a high catalytic efficiency to one . to test biologically relevant oxenes we chose the ketodienes oxo octadecadienoic acid and oxo octadecadienoic acid which are the lipoxygenase products from and hydroperoxy ocatadecatrienoic acids respectively . these ketodienes accumulate in wounded and pathogen infected leaves and cause leaf injury due to their reactivity as michael acceptors . as expected from its reactivity to oxenes at _PROTEIN_ catalyzed the nadph dependent reduction of both and oxoodes at substantial rates . these results show that at _PROTEIN_ is a universal detoxifier of the reactive _PROTEIN_ that are potentially generated in oxidatively stressed cells . we have clarified that at _PROTEIN_ selectively catalyzes the reduction of the unsaturated bond of alkenals to produce n alkanals . to examine whether or not the same reaction is applied to oxenes we determined the structure of the at _PROTEIN_ reduced product of an oxene nonen one to which at _PROTEIN_ exhibited the highest catalytic efficiency . when this oxene was reduced by nadph with at _PROTEIN_ only one product was obtained it was identified as nonanone by a gas _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis . even in a reaction with supraequimolar nadph to the nonen one no reduction of the ketone moiety to alcohol was observed . thus at _PROTEIN_ specifically catalyzes the reduction of the unsaturated bond and retains the _PROTEIN_ moiety in oxenes as in alkenals . to assess the in vivo role of the at _PROTEIN_ we generated transgenic tobacco plants in which the _PROTEIN_ of at _PROTEIN_ was driven by the strong constitutive promoter . we obtained three independent transgenic lines and which showed higher levels of both the mrna and the protein of at _PROTEIN_ than did the control line which had been transformed with an empty vector . no apparent difference in growth was observed among these lines when they were cultured with a day light at as described in materials and methods. we evaluated the levels of at _PROTEIN_ in the leaf extracts from the transgenic and control plants by the hne reducing activity and by immunoblotting . control tobacco showed an hne reducing activity of nmol which was comparable to that in arabidopsis leaves nmol . the transgenic lines and showed to fold higher activity of nadph dependent hne reduction . the addition of the antiserum against recombinant at _PROTEIN_ to the assays suppressed of this activity indicating that the enhanced activities in the transgenic lines were mostly ascribed to the overexpressed at _PROTEIN_ . by immunoblotting the endogenous at _PROTEIN_ protein in arabidopsis leaves was detected as a single band . in contrast no immunoreactive protein was detectable in the leaves of control tobacco although they contained a significant level of nadph dependent hne reducing activity . the activity in the control tobacco might be due to another kind of protein such as _PROTEIN_ . in at _PROTEIN_ overproducing lines and a single band of a similar molecular size was detected with the antiserum as expected . the at _PROTEIN_ protein levels corresponded well with the enzyme activities in leaf extract in these transgenic tobacco lines . thus the functionally active at _PROTEIN_ protein accumulates to high levels in the transgenic plants . activities of _PROTEIN_ sod apx and catalase in leaves of control and at _PROTEIN_ overproducing tobacco plants the enzyme activities in total leaf protein extracts were determined as described in materials and methods. the electron acceptor for _PROTEIN_ assay was hne at . data are represented as means sd . measurements were carried out on four plants per line . asterisks indicate significant differences as compared with control . to assess whether or not at _PROTEIN_ overexpression may have a pleiotropic effect on the activity of the antioxidant system in tobacco we also measured the levels of the major ros scavenging enzymes i.e . sod ascorbate peroxidase and catalase . in the at _PROTEIN_ overproducing plants these enzymatic activities were almost the same as or slightly lower than those in the control line except that the line had a fold higher sod activity than the other lines . endogenous production of hne in plants in response to some biological stress stimuli has been reported . we verified whether or not the at _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in tobacco functions as a detoxifier against hne in the cells . hne was administered to detached leaves of tobacco by applying of hne solution to a puncture site made in the leaf . in darkness a change of leaf color from green to dark green developed concentrically from the puncture point until h postapplication . the darkened area could be _PROTEIN_ as necrotic lesion because the area showed no psii activity as judged by the chlorophyll _METHOD_ parameter maximum photochemical efficiency of psii in the dark _PROTEIN_ state to be zero and was bleached upon exposure to a weak light for h whereas the surrounding nonaffected area showed a full psii activity and was not bleached upon illumination . when leaves were illuminated at from the beginning of incubation bleaching of the leaf tissue i.e . necrosis developed concentrically . the extent of necrosis was not affected by this intensity of light . there was a possibility that the necrosis was an indirect effect of hne specifically it was caused by a metabolite of hne . when the hne at mm in a solution was treated with the recombinant at _PROTEIN_ and mm nadph for min prior to the application on the leaf under which condition more than of the hne was reduced it did not cause necrosis . this excludes the above mentioned possibility and _METHOD_ that the necrosis was caused by hne . necrosis areas resulted from hne at various concentrations in the at _PROTEIN_ overproducing and the control tobaccos are presented in figure . hne at higher concentrations resulted in larger necrosis areas in both the control and the at _PROTEIN_ overproducers but leaves from the overproducers developed significantly smaller necrosis when mm and mm hne was applied . thus the ectopically _PROTEIN_ at _PROTEIN_ conferred tolerance against hne on tobacco leaves . because overproduced at _PROTEIN_ in leaf cells detoxified hne it was expected that the at _PROTEIN_ overproducing tobacco plants would show a tolerance to oxidative stress if reactive _PROTEIN_ are produced during the stress and if the _PROTEIN_ thus produced mediate oxidative damages . to verify this hypothesis we stressed leaves photooxidatively with mv plus light . the mv/light treatment enhances the photoproduction of in chloroplasts and the derived is primarily responsible for cellular injury . participation of reactive _PROTEIN_ if at all in cellular damages would be masked by direct effects of ros under the conditions of a large flux of production . indeed as described below we could confirm that the overexpression of at _PROTEIN_ protected leaf cells under certain combinations of mv concentration and light intensity but when the leaves were treated with mv at or higher or when the light intensity was higher than photons all the tested lines suffered damages to the same extents most probably by the direct action of ros and no tolerance due to the overexpressed at _PROTEIN_ was observed . the tolerance of the at _PROTEIN_ overproducing tobaccos was observed under relatively mild stress conditions as follows in the first set leaf discs were first let absorb mv at or in darkness illuminated at photons for h and then further incubated in darkness for h . in this mild stress treatment the production of is confined to chloroplasts . evaluation of the leaf cell damage was based on the ion leakage from leaf discs as judged by the conductivity of leaf disc floating solution and on the psii activity as judged by the chlorophyll _METHOD_ parameter fv/fm . in the absence of mv the ion leakage of the floating solutions of and lines was slightly higher than that of the control line . when leaf discs were treated with mv the conductivity became higher for all the tested lines reflecting cellular injury due to photooxidative stress caused by mv plus light . obviously and showed smaller increases in conductivity than the control did . in accordance with the conductivity change the fv/fm values became lower by the treatment with mv and here again and lines showed smaller _PROTEIN_ than control did . thus both parameters indicated that and were more tolerant to mv induced photooxidative stress than the control line . the line which exhibited weaker tolerance to hne than and was not more tolerant than the control in this set of stress conditions . it is of note that the loss of psii activity almost corresponded with the increase in ion leakage from cells . thus the psii inactivation is a measure of global cell injury in the mv/light treated leaves . in the second set of conditions we adopted higher mv concentrations and lower light intensities . these conditions induced stronger stress and hence brought about more extensive injury in cells than did the previous conditions as judged from larger _PROTEIN_ in psii activity in the control leaves . leaves from as well as showed tolerance the psii activity _PROTEIN_ in these lines were significantly smaller than those in the control line . when light intensity was increased to photons showed a tolerance but the and lines did not . thus all the at _PROTEIN_ overproducing lines and showed tolerance against the mv mediated photooxidative damage as compared with the control line . the observed tolerance was most likely attributed to the overexpressed at _PROTEIN_ but not to pleiotropic effects of the transgene because the contents of the major ros scavenging enzymes sod apx and catalase were similar in all the tested lines . these results strongly suggest that reactive _PROTEIN_ were produced during the photooxidative stress and participated in the cell injury . we then made a photooxidative stress condition with intense light only without mv . this intense light treatment could induce an oxidatively stressed status that was different from that induced by the mv/light treatment in two aspects . the production of ros is not confined to chloroplasts but the production of in _LOCATION_ could be comparable to that of superoxide in chloroplasts and hence the production sites of reactive _PROTEIN_ could be different . unlike the situation in the presence of mv the electrons from psi can also be distributed to other pathways than the photoreduction of such as the photoreduction of nadp and probably also the reduction of reactive _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ allowing more effective operation of antioxidant functions . by this treatment we also intended to mimic a light excess condition that plants may encounter in natural environments . when tobacco plants grown under a light at photons were illuminated with an intense light psii was inactivated substantially in h . the inactivation was largest in the control line . in all the at _PROTEIN_ overproducing lines it was significantly smaller . the _PROTEIN_ psii activity was partially recovered during the postillumination period indicating that part of the activity loss could be accounted for by the local inactivation of the psii complex in contrast to the irreversible psii inactivation caused by the mv/light treatment . notably after the recovery the psii activity in the at _PROTEIN_ overproducing plants was still significantly higher than that in the control . thus the overproduced at _PROTEIN_ protected leaf cells from intense light induced damages . from the results of this experiment and of the mv/light experiments we can conclude that reactive _PROTEIN_ mediated photooxidative damage of cells partially but significantly . the deduced amino acid sequence of at _PROTEIN_ does not have apparent organelle targeting signal sequences and hence is presumed to reside in _LOCATION_ . we determined the intracellular protein localization by examining the in vivo behavior of the translational fusion protein between at _PROTEIN_ and the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ from aequorea victoria which was _PROTEIN_ in tobacco bright yellow cells . strong green _METHOD_ was distributed in the periphery and the center of the cell . an overlay of _METHOD_ and phase contrast images revealed that the _METHOD_ was distributed in cytoplasm around _LOCATION_ and along _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and in the nucleoplasm of _LOCATION_ . several dark spots in the _LOCATION_ indicated that the fusion protein was excluded from nucleoli . the _METHOD_ signal did not associate with _LOCATION_ proplastids mitochondria or _LOCATION_ . thus at _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is localized in _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ compartments of tobacco cells . specifically the reactive _PROTEIN_ produced under photooxidative stress were scavenged in the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . although unidentified yet the primary production sites of the reactive _PROTEIN_ are presumably very close to the primary sites of ros production . ros are _PROTEIN_ produced in chloroplasts under the mv/light conditions and in both chloroplasts and _LOCATION_ under intense light . then the reactive _PROTEIN_ are able to diffuse from the primary production sites to _LOCATION_ where at _PROTEIN_ would detoxify them . such an indirect action could explain the relatively modest protective effect in spite of the high level _PROTEIN_ of at _PROTEIN_ in the transgenic tobaccos .

cassette was used as a selectable genetic marker . the t dna was introduced into plant cells by cocultivation of tobacco leaf disks with agrobacterium tumefaciens rifr . twenty one independent hygromycin resistant lines of transgenic tobacco obtained were first screened for transgene _PROTEIN_ by rna gel blot hybridization of total rna with at _PROTEIN_ cdna as a probe . the specificity of dna rna hybridization was assessed by comparing the hybridization results with rna from plants transformed with t dna of . the plants were further screened for the _PROTEIN_ of transgene using rna gel blot analysis and progeny of the transgenic lines exhibiting high levels of the transcript were examined for the level of at _PROTEIN_ by western blotting using the antibody against recombinant at
