in arabidopsis thaliana the endogenous danger peptides _PROTEIN_ have been associated with plant defences reminiscent of those induced in pattern triggered immunity . _PROTEIN_ are perceived by two homologous receptor kinases _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and are encoded in the c termini of the propep precursors . here we report that contrary to the seemingly redundant _PROTEIN_ the propeps fall at least into two distinct groups . as revealed by promoter _PROTEIN_ studies _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ and partially overlapped and correlated with those of the _PROTEIN_ and receptors whereas those of _PROTEIN_ and did not share any similarities with the former . moreover bi clustering analysis indicated an association of _PROTEIN_ and with plant defence whereas _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was related to patterns of plant reproduction . in addition at the protein level propeps appeared to be distinct . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was present in the _LOCATION_ but in contrast to previous predictions _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized to the tonoplast . together with the _PROTEIN_ patterns this could point to potentially non redundant roles among the members of the propep family . by contrast their derived _PROTEIN_ including the newly reported _PROTEIN_ when applied exogenously provoked activation of defence related responses in a similar manner suggesting a high level of functional redundancy between the _PROTEIN_ . taken together our findings reveal an apparent antagonism between _PROTEIN_ redundancy and propep variability and indicate new roles for propeps besides plant immunity .
in order to gain insights into the sequence homology of propeps compared with other precursors of plant signalling peptides we searched the arabidopsis genome and identified _PROTEIN_ as a new member of the propep family . it clustered with the other seven propeps despite an overall low sequence homology and its c terminus contained the conserved _PROTEIN_ motif ssg g n . according to sequence similarity _PROTEIN_ was the closest homologue of _PROTEIN_ . moreover addition of a synthetic peptide based on the last aa of _PROTEIN_ triggered similar responses in arabidopsis plants to the other _PROTEIN_ . thus we designated _PROTEIN_ as . further searches for non annotated sequences with similarity to the propeps did not reveal any further propep in arabidopsis . propeps are thought to assist via the release of _PROTEIN_ in biotic stress resistance but their individual roles have not been investigated in detail . whereas _PROTEIN_ are assumed to act rather redundantly little is known about the spatial and temporal _PROTEIN_ of propeps . it has been shown that propeps respond with slight differences to treatments with methyl jasmonate methyl salicylate and _PROTEIN_ . in order to get a better idea about potential redundance as well as specific _PROTEIN_ patterns of the propeps in the context of biotic stress resistance we performed a bi clustering analysis focusing on biotic stress related microarrays that were downloaded from the tair website . thus the probes present on the affymetrix arrays used were grouped based on their _PROTEIN_ patterns over the various biotic stress treatments . genes with similar _PROTEIN_ patterns grouped more closely together as indicated by the dendrogram and became part of a subgroup . enrichment of go _METHOD_ within one subcluster could be used to get indications about the function of the genes in this subcluster . moreover the relative distance of genes within the _PROTEIN_ cluster showed the diversity of regulation of these genes . propep containing clusters were selected by setting an individual cut off within the dendrogram for each propep gene to yield a cluster with < genes . and are not spotted on the arrays used and therefore no bi cluster analysis could be performed for these precursors . of the family members _PROTEIN_ only _PROTEIN_ and clustered together indicating that most of the propeps are _PROTEIN_ in different ways upon treatment with various biotic stimuli . to get an indication of which processes the individual propeps are involved in a go term enrichment analysis was performed on the obtained clusters the top five _METHOD_ of which are shown in fig . . most enriched go _METHOD_ within the top five of each cluster represented a relatively broad description of a process . to also provide data on the more specific processes that are underlying the _PROTEIN_ of these clusters a full overview of all major and minor enriched go _METHOD_ for each propep is provided in supplementary table at jxb online . as most propeps appeared to be involved in very different processes besides biotic stress resistance a co _PROTEIN_ analysis followed by a go term analysis on a set of abiotic or development related microarrays was also performed . these results further supported the idea that propep transcription _METHOD_ to be regulated individually and does not follow a general pattern valid for all propeps . the propep that had the most similar global _PROTEIN_ pattern compared with _PROTEIN_ and was _PROTEIN_ but besides the shared enriched defence associated go _METHOD_ they also had some characteristically different enriched go _METHOD_ . the _PROTEIN_ cluster revealed an additional enrichment of go _METHOD_ related to abiotic stress hypoxia and abscisic acid signalling whereas the _PROTEIN_ and cluster was also associated with salicylic acid signalling cell death and ion transport . distinct from these more defence associated propeps was the cluster of _PROTEIN_ that was enriched for processes related to reproduction and shared the enrichment for gibberellin/terpenoid biosynthesis and lipid signalling with _PROTEIN_ . the most directly noticeable different propep in fig . was _PROTEIN_ whose _PROTEIN_ was induced in conditions where all the other propeps were repressed and vice versa . as the cluster of _PROTEIN_ contained only genes it was too small to result in any enriched go _METHOD_ . to circumvent this the genes that were co _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ given a pearson correlation coefficient cut off of > were used to perform a go term enrichment analysis . this resulted in an enrichment of organismal development developmental processes and chromosome/chromatin organization associated go _METHOD_ . to further diversify the view on propep regulation we also analysed the type of treatments and/or conditions that had the strongest influence on the _PROTEIN_ of each propep a full overview of treatments conditions and their influence on _PROTEIN_ is given in supplementary table at jxb online . here we found in agreement with the bi clustering analysis _PROTEIN_ to be highly induced by abiotic stress treatments like salt drought and osmotic stress whereas for example _PROTEIN_ transcription was highest in certain developmental stages of seeds and flowers . overall our analysis indicated that in contrast to _PROTEIN_ the transcriptional regulation of propeps is most likely non redundant . moreover based on these findings we suggest that individual propeps could play a role in very distinct functions in arabidopsis as they appear to be associated not only with defence but also with processes ranging from abiotic stress resistance to development and reproduction . to investigate further the potential difference in propep _PROTEIN_ at the tissue level we generated transgenic arabidopsis lines containing the putative promoter sequences of the propep genes fused to gus . as shown in fig . the promoters of _PROTEIN_ and exhibited similar _PROTEIN_ patterns . these promoters conferred _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the root excluding the root tip . in adult leaves even after of staining nearly no blue precipitate was visible indicating very low activity of these promoters without stimuli . in contrast wounding of leaves using forceps led to a clear induction of these propep promoters which was restricted to the vasculature . besides the great overlap between the _PROTEIN_ patterns of the promoters of _PROTEIN_ and the latter also produced gus staining in the anthers of flowers . the promoters of _PROTEIN_ and were also active in the root but restricted to the vascular tissue reminiscent of the promoter of _PROTEIN_ . they shared with the promoters of _PROTEIN_ the wound inducibility in the central vasculature of adult leaves . however whereas the promoter of _PROTEIN_ showed strong activity in the leaf veins the promoter of did not produce any gus staining in untreated leaves . in addition they produced distinct staining in adult flowers . the promoter of _PROTEIN_ was highly active in the filaments of flowers whereas that of was active in all flower tissues except for the _PROTEIN_ . thus the promoters of _PROTEIN_ and partially shared their _PROTEIN_ patterns with those of the promoters of _PROTEIN_ but also showed differences from them and among each other . intriguingly the activity of the promoters of _PROTEIN_ and were restricted to the tips of primary and _PROTEIN_ roots whereas neither the other propep promoters nor the promoters of _PROTEIN_ and conferred any obvious gus _PROTEIN_ . moreover _PROTEIN_ of the promoters of _PROTEIN_ and was not detected in flowers and was not induced by wounding . taken together the promoter mediated _PROTEIN_ patterns of the propeps fell clearly into two distinct groups . group which comprised the promoters of _PROTEIN_ and showed _PROTEIN_ in the roots and slightly in the leaf vasculature . they were inducible by wounding . group containing the promoters of _PROTEIN_ and was not inducible by wounding and the basal _PROTEIN_ was restricted to the root tips . next we generated transgenic arabidopsis plants constitutively _PROTEIN_ propep _METHOD_ fusion proteins to assess their subcellular localization . it has been hypothesized that all propeps localize to the cytoplasm based on the predicted function and the lack of an identifiable localization signal . in line with this hypothesis _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized to the cytoplasm . however our findings with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were rather surprising and showed that these precursor proteins were associated with the tonoplast . to clearly distinguish the tonoplast from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ we performed a brief staining which is often used to image the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the overlay confirmed that the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and that emitted from did not overlap . to exclude the possibility that subcellular localization was dependent on the cell type we imaged epidermal cells of cotelydons as well as root epidermal cells and observed that the localization patterns were the same . in contrast a fusion protein of just the c terminal part of _PROTEIN_ which represents _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ produced a _LOCATION_ localization indicating that the association of _PROTEIN_ with the tonoplast seemed to depend on the n terminal part of _PROTEIN_ and was not due to binding of _PROTEIN_ to an as yet unidentified tonoplast localized protein . in order to test further the association of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with the tonoplast we performed plasmolysis triggered by a brief treatment with nacl . as shown in fig . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ remained at the tonoplast of the shrunken _LOCATION_ . these findings demonstrated that members of the propep family are present at two different subcellular compartments the _LOCATION_ and the tonoplast . this might indicate non redundant functions between the propeps at the protein level or an as yet not understood level of complexity of their involvement in cellular immunity . moreover it provides evidence for a potential role of _PROTEIN_ and associated with the _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ are known to be detected by two homologous receptors _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . to investigate the potential overlap of the _PROTEIN_ patterns between the two _PROTEIN_ and the propeps we generated transgenic arabidopsis lines containing the putative promoter sequences of the _PROTEIN_ promoters fused to gus . as shown in fig . both promoters conferred _PROTEIN_ in the vascular tissue of roots and leaves . no _PROTEIN_ promoter mediated gus _PROTEIN_ was observed in root tips . focusing on the _PROTEIN_ in roots the activity of the _PROTEIN_ promoter was more restricted to the central cylinder of the root whereas gus _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ promoter was present in most root tissues . additionally gus _PROTEIN_ mediated by the _PROTEIN_ promoters was detected in _METHOD_ but was almost absent in flowers . when comparing the _PROTEIN_ patterns between the receptors and the precursors the _PROTEIN_ promoter mediated _PROTEIN_ showed partially overlapping patterns with _PROTEIN_ and . by contrast _PROTEIN_ and promoter mediated _PROTEIN_ was exclusive to the root tip a tissue where the _PROTEIN_ were not _PROTEIN_ . these results showed that whereas the promoters of _PROTEIN_ and significantly overlapped in their conferred _PROTEIN_ patterns they shared only a small overlap with the _PROTEIN_ patterns generated by the propep promoters . this indicates potential new unknown roles for at least _PROTEIN_ and independent of _PROTEIN_ . previous studies showing that _PROTEIN_ triggered alkalinization in cell cultures and induced resistance to p. syringae infection in plants provided evidence that some _PROTEIN_ are functionally redundant . to address the extent of functional redundancy among all known _PROTEIN_ we monitored the activation of mapk the release of ethylene and the inhibition of seedling growth stimulated by the eight _PROTEIN_ in the single and double _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ receptor mutants . as shown in fig . all eight _PROTEIN_ activated the stress related mapks _PROTEIN_ and induced the production of ethylene and inhibited seedling growth in a _PROTEIN_ and partially _PROTEIN_ dependent manner . notably _PROTEIN_ were not perceived in the _PROTEIN_ mutant indicating that _PROTEIN_ which is active in this mutant does not perceive these peptides and thus is specific for _PROTEIN_ and whereas the _PROTEIN_ mutant responded to all peptides indicating that _PROTEIN_ recognizes all eight _PROTEIN_ in a similar way . taken together all eight _PROTEIN_ triggered a similar set of defence responses reminiscent of _PROTEIN_ in a _PROTEIN_ and partially _PROTEIN_ dependent manner . thus in contrast to the propeps the _PROTEIN_ as well as _PROTEIN_ appear to be highly redundant .
mature arabidopsis plants were grown in individual pots at and an photoperiod for weeks . for induction of flowering plants were moved to a photoperiod . for preparation of sterile seedlings a. thaliana seeds were surface sterilized with ethanol and plated on half strength murashige and skoog _METHOD_ medium supplemented with sucrose and phytagel for at least d at and then germinated at in continuous light . the t dna insertion lines _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were obtained from the nottingham arabidopsis stock centre and are in the col accession background . the propep and _PROTEIN_ putative promoter sequences were amplified by pcr from genomic col dna with specific primers . the obtained sequences were introduced into the binary destination vector using gateway based cloning . propeps were cloned from col cdna using gene specific primers . introducing propep sequences into the binary destination vector by gateway based recombination led to the in frame fusion of _METHOD_ to their c terminal ends . arabidopsis plants were transformed by agrobacterium tumefaciens using the dip method . peptides of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ obtained from ezbiolabs were dissolved in a solution containing ml of bovine serum albumin and nacl to get peptide stocks of . further dilutions were done with water . bi clustering and co _PROTEIN_ analysis was performed as described by citation with the following minor modifications for bi clustering the euclidean distance measure was used . to obtain separate clusters containing the propeps the first cluster within the dendogram containing less than genes was selected . for gene annotations into biological categories the amigo term enrichment software was employed . for categorization of enriched gene ontology _METHOD_ the categorizer tool using plant go slim _METHOD_ was used applying the consolidated single occurrences count option . supplementary table at jxb online provides a list of the affymetrix microarrays from nascarrays and atgenexpress . plant tissue was fixed in ice cold acetone for washed with water and then placed in gus staining buffer _PROTEIN_ at for or . plant tissue was cleared with ethanol and photographed using an olympus binocular microscope in combination with an olympus camera and the cellsens imaging software . seven d old seedlings _PROTEIN_ the propep _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions were stained for in an aqueous solution containing diluted at ml and washed for in water prior to imaging using an leica confocal microscope . _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ was recorded simultaneously after excitation at using a water immersion objective . plasmolysis was achieved by mounting roots in nacl solution for prior to imaging . for measurement of ethylene accumulation five seedlings were harvested into a glass vial containing of placed back into the growth chamber and left overnight . peptides were added to final concentration and the vials were closed and made air tight with rubber septa . after of incubation on a shaker at room temperature ethylene accumulating in the free air space was measured by gas chromatography . ten seedlings were placed into of sterile water and left floating overnight . peptides were added to a final concentration of . after seedlings were shock frozen and ground to a fine powder before the addition of of extraction buffer _PROTEIN_ . after boiling for of the total cellular protein extract was separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene _LOCATION_ according to the manufacturer s instructions . we used primary monoclonal antibodies against phospho map kinase and actin with alkaline phosphatase conjugated anti rabbit and anti mouse immunoglobulins as secondary antibodies as required . signal detection was performed using cdpstar . at d after germination sterile seedlings were transferred to liquid _METHOD_ medium supplied with the peptides at final concentration . the effect of treatment with different peptides on seedling growth was analysed after d by determining fresh weight .
