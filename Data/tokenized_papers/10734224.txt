the existence of rhodanese in plants has been highly controversial . we have isolated and characterized for the first time in plants two cdnas encoding rhodanese _METHOD_ in arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . both cdnas contained a full length open reading frame the _PROTEIN_ of which increased the rhodanese activity of transgenic yeast . _PROTEIN_ protein was mitochondrial while _PROTEIN_ was _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes originated from the duplication of a large genomic region in chromosome which took place before the appearance of the arabidopsis genus . our results confirm the existence of rhodanese in plants .
the presence of a detectable rhodanese activity in a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ led us to search for rhodanese encoding cdnas by sequence analysis of the a. thaliana subset of the dbest database using animal rhodanese sequences as probes . among the ests of a. thaliana present in dbest eight could be assigned to encode a putative rhodanese and they could be separated into two families . representative ests were sequenced and named _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for a rabidopsis t haliana r ho d anese h omologue and respectively . _PROTEIN_ contained a full length open reading frame encoding a amino acids long protein of kda . _PROTEIN_ contained a full length orf encoding a amino acids long protein of kda . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were identical to each other and respectively and identical to a putative mitochondria targeted rhodanese like protein of datisca glomerata dgtst whose actual function had not been investigated . most of the essential amino acids defined in animal rhodanese were conserved in the plant proteins whose predicted _PROTEIN_ structure could be superimposed on that of bovine rhodanese . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cdnas in transgenic yeast resulted in a two fold increase of their rhodanese activity _PROTEIN_ . thus we conclude that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ encode two functional rhodanese _METHOD_ in a. thaliana . in animals _LOCATION_ mercaptopyruvate cyanide sulfurtransferase _METHOD_ which catalyzes the reaction mercaptopyruvate thiocyanate is closely related to mitochondrial rhodanese . both enzymes catalyze the _METHOD_ and rhodanese reactions and they are actually defined by their preferential use of mercaptopyruvate or thiosulfate respectively . the sequence of the active site of plant rhodanese is closer to that of animal _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ than to that of animal rhodanese _PROTEIN_ . in rat rhodanese the substitution of _PROTEIN_ by c g kg increases the _METHOD_ activity of the mutated protein . therefore plant rhodanese may also have _METHOD_ activity in addition to their rhodanese activity . kinetic characterization of purified recombinant _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins would address this question . the _PROTEIN_ protein had a amino acids long n terminal extension compared to _PROTEIN_ and animal sequences which had the features of a mitochondria targeting peptide . the _PROTEIN_ of a chimeric protein consisting of the n terminal amino acids of _PROTEIN_ fused to the n terminus of the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ in a. thaliana leaves showed a pattern identical to that obtained with spinach mitochondrial cysteine synthase like cs c n terminus _METHOD_ fusion protein . the _PROTEIN_ of a chimeric protein consisting of the n terminal amino acids of _PROTEIN_ fused to the _METHOD_ showed a pattern identical to that of the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ protein . together with the computer prediction for protein targeting these results suggest strongly that _PROTEIN_ would be targeted to the mitochondria while _PROTEIN_ would be located in the _LOCATION_ . in animals rhodanese is mitochondrial while _METHOD_ is _LOCATION_ . the presence of a cyanide sulfurtransferase activity in both subcellular compartments could be a general feature of higher _METHOD_ . the n terminal amino acids in bovine rhodanese are sufficient for mitochondrial import and are not removed during enzyme maturation . in contrast the presence of an n terminal extension in mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ and putative mitochondrial and its absence in _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ suggests strongly that in plants the mitochondrial import of rhodanese could involve the cleavage of a targeting peptide . _PROTEIN_ was identical to gene while _PROTEIN_ was identical to gene both located in chromosome . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes contained respectively and well conserved introns . we investigated whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ could have appeared after a genomic duplication or a single gene duplication event . the complete genetic surroundings of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ spanning respectively kb and part of and kb were compared . the _PROTEIN_ surroundings contain predicted genes of which have a homologue in _PROTEIN_ surroundings . the deduced proteins of these common genes show average sequence identity with their counterparts . thus we conclude that the two rhodanese genes arose from the duplication of a complete genomic region containing numerous genes . three zones can be defined in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ surroundings . the first zone shows seven common genes disposed in the same order with the same orientation and spanning the same space in both genomic regions . their deduced proteins share identity with their counterpart . the second zone is extensively reorganized exhibiting the events of two duplications one quadruplication and a number of gene insertions and deletions . the third zone shows six common orfs disposed in the same order with the same orientation and spanning roughly the same space in both genomic regions . this zone includes the rhodanese gene bordered by an identical trna arg gene . the deduced proteins of these six common genes share identity . therefore the two genomic regions were not subjected to an extensive reorganization after the duplication event except in the second zone . the size of the genomic duplication which could extend upstream and downstream of the regions investigated in this study and the relative positions of the two homologous regions in chromosome are unknown . the completion of the a. thaliana genome sequencing project will address these questions . the deduced proteins of the genes contained in the first and third zones share an average sequence identity . using the calibrated protein clock published by feng et al . we estimate that the duplication in chromosome could have happened million years ago . this duplication would therefore long predate the appearance of the arabidopsis genus estimated to have occurred million years ago . a similar genome structure could exist in other plant genera and families . to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that rhodanese encoding cdnas from plants are characterized . this report _METHOD_ the existence of rhodanese in plants and gives a final answer to an older debate . the availability of plants rhodanese cdnas will make it possible to better characterize the biochemical characteristics and the physiological function of this enzyme which remains poorly understood even in animals .
