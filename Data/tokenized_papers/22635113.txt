hydroxy fatty acids are predominantly present in sphingolipids and have important physicochemical and physiological functions in eukaryotic cells . recent studies from our group demonstrated that sphingolipid fatty acid hydroxylase _PROTEIN_ is required for the function of arabidopsis bax inhibitor which is an _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized cell death suppressor . however little is known about the function of two arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ homologs _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and it remains unclear whether hfas participate in cell death regulation . in this study we found that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ had _PROTEIN_ activity and the interaction with arabidopsis cytochrome was needed for the sufficient activity . hfa analysis of _PROTEIN_ knockdown lines and _PROTEIN_ mutant showed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ hydroxylated very long chain fatty acid whereas _PROTEIN_ selectively hydroxylated palmitic acid in arabidopsis . in addition hfas were related to resistance to oxidative stress and _PROTEIN_ or hydroxy vlcfa showed particularly strong responses to oxidative stress . furthermore _PROTEIN_ interacted with atbi via cytochrome more preferentially than _PROTEIN_ . our results suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are functionally different _PROTEIN_ and that _PROTEIN_ or hydroxy vlcfa is a key _PROTEIN_ in atbi mediated cell death suppression .
we showed previously that _PROTEIN_ is localized in the _LOCATION_ . to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ has the same function as _PROTEIN_ or not we first confirmed the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ . fusion constructs of _PROTEIN_ were generated using genes encoding _METHOD_ driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . when bombarded in onion epidermal cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized in the cell periphery the perinuclear region and the _LOCATION_ network . in addition _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was colocalized always with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ also localizes in the _LOCATION_ . as described above neither _PROTEIN_ nor _PROTEIN_ has any like domains . citation demonstrated that the like domain is essential for human activity implying that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ require an _LOCATION_ localized to increase their activity . in _PROTEIN_ we have already demonstrated that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interacted with all _LOCATION_ localized in yeast cells . in addition the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and b which is one of four _LOCATION_ type was reported in plant cells using a _METHOD_ resonance energy transfer analysis . accordingly we attempted to verify the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and b in plant cells by using a bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation assay . the _METHOD_ vector contains _METHOD_ in the n terminal side of the target proteins driven by promoter whereas the _METHOD_ vector contains _METHOD_ in the c terminal side . when _METHOD_ b and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were transiently coexpressed in onion epidermal cells we observed bifc _METHOD_ that was highly localized in the cell periphery and the perinuclear regions . this signal was similar to that of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in _METHOD_ of localization and intensity . in contrast no _METHOD_ signal was visible using empty vectors _METHOD_ . in these studies dsred driven by promoter was used as an _PROTEIN_ marker of particle bombardment . these results suggest that not only _PROTEIN_ but also _PROTEIN_ interacts with b in plant cells . to clarify whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ we performed a complementation test using yeast deletion variant which can not produce any hfas . in these experiments _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ was transformed into and total lipids were extracted using the folch method described previously . hfa methyl esters were fractionated by thin layer chromatography after derivatization of fatty acids and were detected by gas chromatography _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . in this assay hydroxy hexacosanoic acid was evaluated as a marker of hfas because occupied almost all hfas in yeast . as shown in figure accumulated in _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but not in suggesting that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have _PROTEIN_ activity . however these levels were quite less than those of the wild type and _PROTEIN_ . this finding may be due to the structural difference between and _PROTEIN_ with or without like domain respectively . transformation of b into _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ resulted in a marked increase in the amounts of . b itself exhibited no _PROTEIN_ activity because no was detected in b _PROTEIN_ . these results indicate that is a key _PROTEIN_ for the activity of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . to elucidate the roles of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in hfa synthesis pathway and the physiological functions in arabidopsis we searched for _PROTEIN_ knockout lines . however no suitable t dna insertion line for _PROTEIN_ is available among the existing t dna mutant collections . we therefore generated _PROTEIN_ knockdown transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ by rna interference with bp of untranslated region in _PROTEIN_ cdna as a trigger . reverse transcription pcr analysis confirmed that _PROTEIN_ was markedly reduced in _PROTEIN_ kd and lines . in contrast we obtained t dna tagged arabidopsis line in _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ which has a t dna insertion in third exon . as shown in figure not only the full length _PROTEIN_ mrna but also the upstream region of t dna insertion site in _PROTEIN_ gene was completely deleted . _PROTEIN_ kd and _PROTEIN_ plants showed no apparent phenotype compared with the week old wild type plants under normal growth condition . we first dissected hfa composition in these transgenic plants . total lipids including total sphingolipids were extracted from the aboveground parts in week old plants according to citation and these hfa methyl esters were detected with gc _METHOD_ after derivatization . in this study we analyzed five major hfas of hfas in arabidopsis . in the _PROTEIN_ kd lines the levels of and were considerably lower than in wild type whereas the level of was marginally _PROTEIN_ . in contrast the level of was markedly reduced by in _PROTEIN_ mutant whereas the levels of other hfas were similar to those in wild type . thus these results suggest that vlcfa is hydroxylated by _PROTEIN_ whereas palmitic acid is hydroxylated by _PROTEIN_ and marginally _PROTEIN_ . our previous report suggested that _PROTEIN_ is related to atbi mediated suppression of cell death . because atbi is reported to suppress oxidative stress induced cell death we tested the sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ kd and _PROTEIN_ plants to oxidative stress by using ros inducing chemicals hydrogen peroxide and menadione . treatment of leaf discs obtained from week old plants with mm or md for h significantly increased electrolyte leakage in _PROTEIN_ kd and _PROTEIN_ plants compared with wild type . electrolyte leakage measurement is the assay often used to examine irreversible _LOCATION_ damage by oxidative stress or during cell death . in addition chlorophyll contents in _PROTEIN_ kd and _PROTEIN_ plants were lower than wild type indicating that _PROTEIN_ kd and _PROTEIN_ plants have higher sensitivity to oxidative stress . moreover _PROTEIN_ gene controlled by its native promoter _PROTEIN_ complemented the _PROTEIN_ phenotype for oxidative stress induced ion leakage and chlorophyll contents . these results suggest the involvement of hfas in the resistant response to oxidative stress . next the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrnas in response to were examined . total mrnas were extracted from d old wild type plants treated with mm for and h. rt pcr analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ mrna increased rapidly at h and subsequently remained at higher levels than no treatment although they were _PROTEIN_ slightly with time . _PROTEIN_ mrna diminished gradually from h and was only _PROTEIN_ weakly at h. incidentally atbi mrna continued to increase gradually in response to until h. these results imply that _PROTEIN_ promptly responds to oxidative stress whereas _PROTEIN_ does not . to clarify the roles of hfas in the response to oxidative stress we examined changes in fatty acids in response to oxidative stress . four week old arabidopsis wild type plants were treated with for h and their derivatized hfa methyl esters and nonhydroxy fatty acid methyl esters were analyzed by gc _METHOD_ as shown in figure the total non hfa content was significantly lower at h after treatment with . in contrast total hfa content was higher at h after treatment with . however the amount of was not affected by whereas the levels of total hydroxy vlcfas were especially elevated . these results suggest the importance of hydroxy vlcfas under oxidative stress condition . to further confirm the relationship between _PROTEIN_ and oxidative stress we analyzed the levels of oxidative stress related metabolites in the leaves of week old _PROTEIN_ kd and _PROTEIN_ plants grown under normal growth conditions by using a capillary electrophoresis _METHOD_ as shown in figure reduced glutathione level in _PROTEIN_ kd was significantly lower than wild type plants whereas oxidized glutathione was markedly higher resulting in reduced rate of gsh in total glutathione in spite of the lower total glutathione in _PROTEIN_ kd lines . in addition reduced ascorbate was markedly lower in _PROTEIN_ kd lines . moreover aminobutyric acid was markedly increased compared with wild type plants . in contrast the levels of glutathione reduced ascorbate and gaba in _PROTEIN_ were similar to those in wild type . ascorbate is the most important reducing substrate for detoxification in plant cells and the series of ros scavenging reactions accompanied by glutathione is called the ascorbate glutathione cycle . when plants are exposed to ros mediated stresses glutathione ascorbate cycle participates in detoxification of ros at the expense of electrons from the gsh pool causing a transient increase in gssg . in addition gaba is a four _PROTEIN_ nonprotein amino acid that is rapidly and markedly produced in response to biotic and abiotic stress . therefore these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ kd lines are exposed to some stress even under nonstress conditions . taken together the results indicate that hfas seem important in the plant machinery that serves to resist oxidative stress and that the role of hydroxy vlcfas in oxidative stress response _METHOD_ different from that of . to reinforce the link between _PROTEIN_ and atbi mediated suppression of cell death we examined the three way interaction among atbi and _PROTEIN_ in plant cells using the bifc based fret assay in plant cells . this assay detects ternary complexes in living cells by the combination of bifc and fret assays . when the combination of atbi _METHOD_ _METHOD_ b and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the combination of atbi _METHOD_ _METHOD_ b and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were transiently _PROTEIN_ in onion epidermal cells _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and bifc signal were completely merged in both combinations . we next examined the interactions between atbi and or by fret acceptor photobleaching analysis . the mean fret efficiency was for the pair of atbi _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . in contrast the pair of atbi _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ showed a lower level fret efficiency although the efficiency was significantly higher than control experiments _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . these results suggest preferential ternary interactions among atbi and _PROTEIN_ and strongly support the significance of _PROTEIN_ in atbi mediated cell death regulation .
