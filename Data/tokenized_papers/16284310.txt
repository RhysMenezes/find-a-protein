the synthesis of cellulose microfibrils requires the presence of a _LOCATION_ bound endo d _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . although the exact biochemical role of _PROTEIN_ in cellulose synthesis is unknown we used the protein as a marker to explore the potential involvement of subcellular transport processes in cellulose synthesis . using _METHOD_ and a green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion that complemented the phenotype conferred by the _PROTEIN_ mutant we investigated the distribution of _PROTEIN_ in epidermal cells in the root meristem . _PROTEIN_ was localized in intracellular compartments corresponding to a heterogeneous population of organelles which comprised the _LOCATION_ apparatus labeled compartments referred to as early endosomes and in the case of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ the tonoplast . inhibition of cellulose synthesis by isoxaben promoted a net redistribution of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ toward a homogeneous population of compartments distinct from early endosomes which were concentrated close to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ facing the root surface . a redistribution of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ away from early endosomes was also observed in the same cells at _PROTEIN_ stages of cell elongation . a subpopulation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ containing compartments followed trajectories along the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and this motility required intact microtubules . these observations demonstrate that the deposition of cellulose like chitin synthesis in yeast involves the regulated intracellular cycling of at least one enzyme required for its synthesis .
an affinity purified polyclonal antiserum against the n terminal _LOCATION_ domain of _PROTEIN_ referred to as recognized a unique kd band on immunoblots of crude extracts prepared from wild type arabidopsis seedlings . extracts from seedlings homozygous for the leaky _PROTEIN_ allele and the null _PROTEIN_ allele showed a weak band and no band at all respectively demonstrating the specificity of the antiserum . this antiserum recognized a protein in all growing plant organs such as _METHOD_ leaves roots and hypocotyls . _PROTEIN_ was undetectable in imbibed seeds and appeared during germination in dark grown seedlings peaked during the growth phase of the hypocotyl and disappeared again at the end of the elongation phase . in light grown conditions a similar pattern was observed except that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ remained detectable also after hypocotyl growth arrest . to study the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ we performed immunolocalization with in root cells . surprisingly no _PROTEIN_ labeling was detected in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or in the developing cell plate in dividing cells . by contrast the antibody revealed an intracellular punctate staining pattern in arabidopsis root cells . no _PROTEIN_ labeling was detected in the null allele _PROTEIN_ confirming again the specificity of the antibody . as an additional control root cells of wild type plants _PROTEIN_ a c myc tagged version of _PROTEIN_ from the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter were doubly labeled with and a monoclonal anti c myc antibody . the c myc tagged protein was still functional in that it was able to complement the hypocotyl and root phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . both antibodies colocalized again confirming the specificity of the immunolabeling . to confirm the intracellular localization a translational _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was _PROTEIN_ under the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus promoter in homozygous _PROTEIN_ . to ascertain the biological activity of this construct we compared the hypocotyl length of dark grown seedlings and the root length of light grown seedlings of the wild type _PROTEIN_ and the transformants . although _PROTEIN_ seedlings exhibited their characteristic short hypocotyl phenotype several independent transformants developed hypocotyl length similar to that of the wild type control . the same _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines showed a root length that was intermediate between _PROTEIN_ and wild type roots when grown in the light . it is conceivable that the partial complementation of the root phenotype is the result of a negative effect of the overexpression of the fusion protein on root growth because the same construct also interfered slightly with root growth when _PROTEIN_ in a wild type background . in conclusion depending on the cellular context the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein complemented totally or partially the growth defect of _PROTEIN_ . the fusion protein therefore is at least in part targeted to the same subcellular compartments as the wild type protein . we next investigated the subcellular localization of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein using confocal laser scanning microscopy on root epidermal cells in their early elongation phase . similar to the antibody staining a punctate _METHOD_ signal was observed . the orthogonal projection obtained from successive confocal sections showed that the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ containing compartments were concentrated close to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . moreover the tonoplast was strongly labeled which was not observed with in wild type plants or in plants overexpressing the _PROTEIN_ c myc construct from the same promoter . therefore the tonoplast labeling must be related to the properties of the _METHOD_ fusion protein . again no labeling of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was observed and despite numerous attempts we have never observed cell plate labeling in dividing root cells embryonic cells or arabidopsis cell suspension cultures . to characterize the intracellular compartments we first performed double labeling experiments with and anti c myc on roots _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ localized protein c myc . _PROTEIN_ partially colocalized with the _LOCATION_ marker . the intracellular distribution of _PROTEIN_ varied in different cell types and plant species . for instance no colocalization was observed in maize root cells labeled with and an antibody raised against a glycan epitope present in the _LOCATION_ apparatus and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . together these observations indicate that _PROTEIN_ accumulated in a heterogeneous population of compartments which can comprise the _LOCATION_ apparatus depending on the cellular context . to further characterize the heterogeneous population of _PROTEIN_ containing compartments we used the _METHOD_ styryl dye which is known to follow the endocytic pathway from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ via endosomes to the _LOCATION_ when exogenously added to yeast or plant cells . immediately after adding the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of root epidermal cells was labeled . ten minutes _PROTEIN_ appeared in intracellular compartments which given the short internalization times are thought to correspond to early endosomes . these compartments partially colocalized with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ suggesting that the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in these compartments also was internalized from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in addition we observed characteristic composite structures consisting of two adjacent compartments labeled respectively by _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and . to confirm the localization in the early endosomes we studied the effect of the vesicle trafficking inhibitor brefeldin a on the dynamics of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ compartments . short term treatments with bfa induce in root cells the reversible formation of large aggregates which contain both exocytic and endocytic material . roots were treated for a short time with bfa and the localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was followed in root cells at different growth stages . we first observed that the responses to bfa treatments were variable among individual roots and even within the same root among cells at different growth stages . similar observations have been reported recently and may reflect local differences in auxin concentration . in elongating cells a min bfa treatment led to the disappearance of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labeled punctate structures and a concomitant emergence of a single large aggregate per cell without affecting the labeling of the tonoplast . this treatment was completely reversible upon withdrawal of bfa . bfa induced compartments were also observed in wild type root cells upon _METHOD_ staining with . to confirm the presence of _PROTEIN_ in endosomal compartments double labeling of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was performed in _PROTEIN_ c myc seedlings after bfa treatment . _PROTEIN_ is an arf gef that mediates the endosomal recycling of _PROTEIN_ a transport facilitator of the plant hormone auxin . upon bfa treatment we observed a partial colocalization of _PROTEIN_ c myc and _PROTEIN_ suggesting that these proteins are present in overlapping endosomal compartments . together these observations demonstrate the presence of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ like endogenous _PROTEIN_ in early endosomal compartments . actin is known to play a major role in organelle motility and vesicle trafficking . to determine the role of actin on the localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labeled compartments we treated roots with cytochalasin d which depolymerizes actin filaments . short treatments with cytd alone did not lead to observable changes in the distribution of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ compartments . pretreatment of cytd however inhibited the formation of the large bfa induced compartment . these observations confirm that the formation of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ containing bfa induced compartment depended on an intact actin _LOCATION_ . the observations described above showed that _PROTEIN_ accumulated in a heterogeneous population of intracellular compartments . these compartments may either reflect an intracellular activity for _PROTEIN_ or may be part of a general trafficking pathway that controls the access of _PROTEIN_ to its _LOCATION_ substrate . to investigate the relation between _PROTEIN_ localization and cellulose synthesis we first studied the localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts generated from leaf mesophyll cells . despite the highly active cellulose synthesis machinery in regenerating protoplasts _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was still present in intracellular compartments without detectable staining of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in a second experiment roots were treated with isoxaben which targets the cellulose synthase catalytic subunits _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and specifically inhibits cellulose synthesis in < h . seedlings were treated with isoxaben for h and the subcellular localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was monitored in root epidermal cells and compared with the localization of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker _METHOD_ . in the presence of isoxaben no accumulation in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was observed . interestingly however the average size and intracellular distribution of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ containing compartments had changed in contrast with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker _METHOD_ the localization of which was unaffected by the treatment . to quantify these changes we measured the relative surface area of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labeled compartments and determined their intracellular distribution by counting the compartments present in successive optical sections between the external cell surface and the tonoplast and comparing this number with the total number of compartments in each cell . in control cells a broad size distribution was observed with a median surface area of . in isoxaben treated cells _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labeled compartments were smaller more homogeneous as shown by the narrower size distribution and closer to the external surface of the cells . labeling with for min revealed endosomal compartments in both control and isoxaben treated seedlings indicating that in contrast with auxin isoxaben did not affect endocytosis per se . interestingly only in control cells did _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ partially colocalize with compartments whereas in isoxaben treated cells no such colocalization was observed . in addition in isoxaben treated cells we never observed the composite structures consisting of two adjacent compartments labeled by _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and respectively . these results indicate that the inhibition of cellulose synthesis by isoxaben coincided with a redistribution of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ out of labeled compartments and into a homogeneous population of smaller _PROTEIN_ distributed compartments which were detected primarily adjacent to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ facing the root surface . the observations described above show that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cycles through different intracellular compartments and that the cycling dynamics can be influenced by isoxaben . we next investigated whether the cycling is regulated during different growth stages of the cell . to this end we incubated d old roots for min with and compared the colocalization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with the dye in two distinct populations of epidermal cells small cells of in their early elongation phase and larger but still rapidly expanding cells more proximally in the root elongation zone . fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy showed that the relative cellulose content was higher in the larger cells than in the smaller cells . individual cells in both cell populations showed large variations in colocalization which may reflect local variations in auxin as described by citation or some other critical _PROTEIN_ . interestingly despite these large variations highly significant differences were observed in the colocalization between the two cell populations . indeed in smaller cells on average of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ compartments colocalized with the early endosomal marker compared with only in the larger cells . these results demonstrate that the intracellular cycling of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was developmentally regulated with a preferential mobilization out of labeled compartments in larger cells with higher relative cellulose contents . to study the motility of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ compartments we produced time lapse videos of root cells . the video shows that at least a subpopulation of these compartments was motile and showed linear trajectories parallel to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . cortical microtubules like cellulose microfibrils form transversely oriented arrays in elongating cells . evidence that microtubules can orient the deposition of microfibrils exists but the exact mechanistic link between microtubule orientation and cellulose deposition is not understood . given the key role for _PROTEIN_ in cellulose synthesis it is conceivable that the movement of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ compartments is related to the oriented deposition of the cellulose microfibrils . therefore we investigated whether there was a link between the directional movements of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ compartments and microtubules . seedlings were treated for min with oryzalin to depolymerize microtubules . interestingly this treatment completely abolished the motility of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labeled compartments which indicated that the dynamic behavior of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ compartments in contrast with early endosomes or the _LOCATION_ apparatus depended on the presence of intact microtubules . the oryzalin treatment also caused the formation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ containing aggregates . as a control similar oryzalin treatments did not provoke clusters of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ fusion protein or of a _LOCATION_ marker indicating that oryzalin specifically disturbed the localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ compartments . using manual tracking the average velocity of these compartments was evaluated at whereas acceleration and deceleration phases could be observed with peak velocities of up to . the average velocity is much lower than that reported for the _LOCATION_ apparatus and processive myosin movement on actin and is closer to the velocity of kinesin movement on microtubules .
