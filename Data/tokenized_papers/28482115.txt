arabinogalactan proteins _PROTEIN_ are involved in numerous important functions in plants but the relevance of their complex structure to physiological function and cellular fate is unresolved . using a fully functional _METHOD_ version of arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ we show that this protein is localized at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as well as in endosomes and soluble in the apoplast . _PROTEIN_ is likely to be is highly and carries two epitopes previously associated with arabinogalactan proteins . the activity of _PROTEIN_ was resistant against deletion of the fasciclin domain and was unaffected by removal of the signal a highly conserved or the deletion of predicted sites . nonetheless these structural changes dramatically _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ with acting at the level of _LOCATION_ and influencing fate . we show that _PROTEIN_ acts predominantly by molecular interactions involving its _PROTEIN_ fasciclin domain and that its fasciclin domain is required for stabilization of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization . _PROTEIN_ functions as a soluble glycoprotein via its _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domain and its normal cellular trafficking depends on and .
we generated _PROTEIN_ an fusion between the predicted _PROTEIN_ signal peptide fused to the yellow _METHOD_ protein monomeric citrin followed by the _PROTEIN_ coding region including the predicted driven by various promoters and transformed _PROTEIN_ mutant plants with the constructs . on _METHOD_ standard media both _PROTEIN_ alleles showed _PROTEIN_ root length and significantly increased root _PROTEIN_ compared to their respective background and after transfer to medium containing mm nacl underwent dramatic radial swelling and reduction of elongation as previously described . both mutant alleles _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ had an identical effect on root growth . _PROTEIN_ of under the control of either the _PROTEIN_ or the _PROTEIN_ promoter region in _PROTEIN_ mutants reverted root length and _PROTEIN_ to dimensions . hence fulfils the role of endogenous _PROTEIN_ in root growth and salt tolerance . _PROTEIN_ supports normal root growth and salt tolerance in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant background . phenotype of seedlings growing on standard medium without _METHOD_ or with mm nacl root length and _PROTEIN_ on _METHOD_ for days and root width and elongation growth for days on mm nacl containing medium . the transgene driven by the _PROTEIN_ or the _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ mutant background show a like growth phenotype . the transgenic lines used for this figure were _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _LOCATION_ bars indicate the confidence interval . confocal microscopy of seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed that the transgene was _PROTEIN_ throughout the primary root . the _PROTEIN_ reached a local maximum in the _PROTEIN_ cell division zone in the epidermis shortly before cells underwent rapid elongation . the cortex and underlying cell layers in the meristematic region _PROTEIN_ the transgene only at a low level . as cells entered the zone of rapid elongation and subsequently the cell differentiation zone signal intensity in the epidermal layer gradually _PROTEIN_ with a concomitant increase in the cortical layer . the protein predominantly localized to the cell periphery in a thin line at the cell surface _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . tangential optical sections of epidermal cells revealed resolution punctae _PROTEIN_ . in standard _PROTEIN_ mode at high laser intensity an intracellular signal was seen in addition to the saturated signal . the intracellular signal partially with _PROTEIN_ and with _PROTEIN_ markers for _PROTEIN_ and recycling endosomal compartments respectively . in both cases occurred in relatively diffuse areas but not in punctae . with these two markers suggested a certain degree of endocytosis of . to confirm this possibility we tested the effect of brefeldin a which inhibits recycling of endocytosed cargo from the endosome to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and leads to the accumulation of recycling endosomes to approximately large intracellular structures termed bfa bodies . localization was highly sensitive to bfa treatment . after min of bfa exposure localization in bfa bodies became apparent . after prolonged exposure to the drug the localization of in bfa bodies predominated over _LOCATION_ localization . in brief is mostly localized at the cell surface . of with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as well as sensitivity to bfa both suggest that _PROTEIN_ undergoes endocytosis and is recycled to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in a bfa sensitive manner . _PROTEIN_ and localization of in roots . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the root meristem and early elongation zone . transverse x through the quiescent center cell and elongation zone . the construct is maximally _PROTEIN_ in the epidermis of the division zone . during maturation the epidermal _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ in more central cell layers increases . high resolution conventional confocal and _PROTEIN_ confocal micrograph taken in the cell division zone . partial overlap between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ in diffuse intracellular compartments but not in the brightest _PROTEIN_ punctae . scale bars in and . treatment with brefeldin a for different durations . to distinguish between _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ attachment and free apoplastic localization we induced partial plasmolysis using m mannitol . in plasmolyzing cells in the root elongation zone with the styryl dye at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and in hechtian strands that remained attached to the cell wall and it was localized diffusely in the apoplastic space between the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the cell wall . a similar dual apoplastic and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization was displayed by the _METHOD_ while the integral _LOCATION_ protein _PROTEIN_ was exclusively _LOCATION_ localized . to estimate the overall degree of association of to _LOCATION_ and the cell wall we fractionated extracts of roots _PROTEIN_ into a fast sedimenting fraction a slowly sedimenting fraction and a soluble fraction . the protein blots were sequentially probed with antibodies for _METHOD_ for _PROTEIN_ and the integral _LOCATION_ protein _PROTEIN_ . was mostly detected in microsomes and to a lesser extent in the cell wall with a much lesser contribution from the soluble fraction . by contrast the _PROTEIN_ signal mostly partitioned to the cell wall fraction with the soluble and the microsomal fractions making approximately equal contributions . _PROTEIN_ conversely was present in the cell wall and in the microsomal fraction in equal proportions . this indicated that both putative proteins were partially bound to and partially released from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ albeit in an apparently different proportion and that compared to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the cell wall association of was only moderate . to test whether short hyperosmotic shock as applied during the plasmolysis experiments might alter the partitioning of e.g . by activation of endogenous lipases we also extracted protein from roots that were to m mannitol . however the partitioning of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was not affected by this treatment . in summary functionally complements endogenous _PROTEIN_ in its role in root growth and salt tolerance . the reporter protein is primarily anchored to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ from where it is endocytosed or released to the apoplast . _PROTEIN_ is localized both at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and in the apoplast . _PROTEIN_ and . _METHOD_ and . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . equivalent proportions of the pellet after centrifugation at g and the supernatant and pellet after subsequent g centrifugation were loaded on gels and probed with antibodies against _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the extraction was replicated with material previously exposed to partial plasmolysis by mm mannitol . the asterisk on the blot exposed to antiserum indicates an unspecific band as previously noted . a plausible mechanism of dual localization of at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and in the apoplast is by means of . instability of the _METHOD_ epitope towards digestion and apparent release of the protein from the _LOCATION_ fraction under control conditions precluded unambiguous enzymatic demonstration of . to test whether the that is predicted to act as signal is required for the _LOCATION_ attachment of we transformed plants with the construct that lacked the aminoacid residues at the _PROTEIN_ . in contrast to the fusion protein the truncated construct partitioned to the soluble fraction supporting the requirement of the domain for _LOCATION_ attachment . this was confirmed at the microscopic level where failed to label the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but was in a mostly intracellular localization where it with _LOCATION_ red _METHOD_ protein _LOCATION_ . was apparently complete including an intracellular mesh and fusiform _LOCATION_ bodies . upon plasmolysis most of the derived signal was retained in the cytoplasm while the _LOCATION_ space was filled with a faint diffuse signal but neither _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ nor hechtian strands were labelled by . this suggested that the protein lacking the signal was partially secreted but was not _LOCATION_ associated . interestingly exposure to bfa triggered the recruitment of into bfa bodies albeit at a lower intensity compared to the construct . surprisingly despite its importance for _LOCATION_ attachment and _LOCATION_ the signal of _PROTEIN_ was not required for genetic function as indicated by normal root growth of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants on medium with and without mm nacl . in summary the _PROTEIN_ signal is required for _LOCATION_ anchoring efficient _LOCATION_ secretion and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization of while in the absence of _LOCATION_ anchoring a low level of secretion and endocytosis takes place and most importantly the genetic function in roots remains intact . localization _PROTEIN_ . requirement of the region for _LOCATION_ association . transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or truncated are separated into supernatant and pellet . _LOCATION_ is only detected in the soluble fraction . with _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ . plasmolysis of and _PROTEIN_ indicates residual secretion but no _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization of . after brefeldin a treatment is partially localized to bfa structures . the significance of the tandem _PROTEIN_ organization of _PROTEIN_ is presently elusive . a protein sequence alignment of putative _PROTEIN_ orthologues from different phyla of flowering plants showed that the _PROTEIN_ domain was more conserved than the _PROTEIN_ domain . between the aligned sequences the _PROTEIN_ domain was identical and divergent while the _PROTEIN_ domain was identical and divergent . the evolutionary trend of higher structural divergence in _PROTEIN_ compared to _PROTEIN_ was confirmed by a survey of naturally occurring sequence _METHOD_ among hundreds of arabidopsis thaliana accessions in the genomes database . in the residues of the _PROTEIN_ domain the genomes database yielded dna _METHOD_ giving rise to eight divergent aminoacid substitutions in the _PROTEIN_ protein sequence while in the _PROTEIN_ domain there were only two highly conserved _METHOD_ . to experimentally address the functional role of the _PROTEIN_ domain for _PROTEIN_ function we generated versions of lacking the _PROTEIN_ domain and varying lengths of the central _PROTEIN_ domain . most constructs lacking the _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ domain complemented the _PROTEIN_ mutants . the shortest construct consistently complementing _PROTEIN_ ubq lacked both the _PROTEIN_ and the entire _PROTEIN_ domain . while of the lines transformed with either the ubq construct or less truncated versions displayed complementation of _PROTEIN_ the construct ubq in which four more residues including the predicted site were deleted was functional in only of tested transgenic lines . removal of seven more aminoacid residues in the construct completely abolished genetic function . we next assessed whether the _PROTEIN_ domain was important for either protein localization or abundance in vivo . like the fusion protein displayed cell peripheral localization and localized to intracellular particles however the abundance in intracellular structures was strongly increased in the mutant compared to the version . moreover the product very brightly localized to cell corners i.e . junctions between epidermal and cortical cells . the intracellular particles did not notably overlap with _LOCATION_ but with _PROTEIN_ and to a greater degree than the protein . by contrast solely resided in an intracellular network that with _LOCATION_ but neither with _PROTEIN_ nor with . plasmolysis of root cells _PROTEIN_ the truncated constructs showed a bright signal in the apoplast and less bright labelling of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ while remained strictly intracellular . treatment with bfa led to the accumulation of in bfa bodies while the distribution of product was unaffected by the drug . the microscopic data suggested that _PROTEIN_ efficiently exited the _LOCATION_ travelled all the way down the secretory pathway to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the apoplast and either was rapidly endocytosed accumulating in _PROTEIN_ positive recycling endosomes or was shed into the apoplast . by contrast the localization of suggested that the protein was completely retained in the _LOCATION_ . to more precisely determine the region in _PROTEIN_ that is responsible for _LOCATION_ of the truncated but functional _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ we microscopically analysed transformants _PROTEIN_ transgenes to . in the and the and to products we observed both _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and endosomal localization with the mutant lines additionally showing localization in cell corners and a greater proportion of endosomal vs. _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization compared with the . however the localization mostly resembled the _LOCATION_ pattern of and was hardly visible at the cell surface . in summary the _PROTEIN_ domain was not required for _PROTEIN_ function but was required to stabilize _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization of the protein . on the other hand the integrity of the region of the _PROTEIN_ domain was not only essential for genetic function but also for the exit from the _LOCATION_ . we next investigated the significance of of _PROTEIN_ and specifically of the region of _PROTEIN_ . normal localization of depends on the region of the protein . constructs lacking only the _PROTEIN_ region or the _PROTEIN_ and the entire _PROTEIN_ and the of the _PROTEIN_ region are to different compartments . of and with _LOCATION_ . of and with _PROTEIN_ . of and with _PROTEIN_ . of and with in partially plasmolyzed cells . _PROTEIN_ contains eight predicted sites and might be the most highly arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ . to experimentally confirm the presence of on we used specific glycosidases . endoglycosidase h cleaves the glycosidic linkage between the two core _PROTEIN_ residues in oligomannosidic but not in complex . treatment of extract with induced a molecular weight shift of a minor fraction of resulting in a weak sharp band of approximately kda . because the untreated smeared between and kda we calculated a molecular weight shift between and kda . this endo h sensitive fraction represented carrying oligomannosidic en route to the _LOCATION_ . peptide f cleaves the glycosidic links between the innermost glcnac residue and asparagine of in both oligomannosidic and complex however the enzyme is blocked by fucosylation at the innermost glcnac of complex . treatment of with pngase f resulted in an electrophoretic pattern identical to the one seen after digestion . this suggested that most complex on might be fucosylated . to test this hypothesis we crossed _PROTEIN_ with the biosynthesis defective _PROTEIN_ mutant . in the _PROTEIN_ background was fully sensitive to pngase f as seen by the complete disappearance of product at kda . the resulting signal was found in a minor sharp band at kda exactly as seen in the _PROTEIN_ wt background and in a novel fraction that smeared between and kda with its maximum at around kda . therefore fucosylated complex contributed around kda to the major fraction of . variably sized additional modifications contributing kda were only present on the insensitive fraction . we next tested the of two truncated versions of namely and . like a small fraction of experienced a downward shift in apparent molecular weight after digestion with and pngasef suggesting that and the protein were in the _LOCATION_ and underwent remodelling in the _LOCATION_ at a similar rate . by contrast digestion with both and pngase f of led to the full downward shift of the entire protein indicating that was exclusively decorated with oligomannosidic . consistent with its microscopic localization this suggested that was fully retained in the _LOCATION_ . to assess which sites were most highly conserved in _PROTEIN_ domains of _PROTEIN_ we aligned the individual domains of all arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ . while several _PROTEIN_ domains contained predicted directly adjacent to their domains _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or domains _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the most conserved position for in _PROTEIN_ domains was residues upstream the domain . we detected this predicted glycosylation site in every single _PROTEIN_ domain _PROTEIN_ except _PROTEIN_ and in every tandem _PROTEIN_ domain _PROTEIN_ except _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ . . as the region containing the predicted glycosylation site at was crucial for secretion and also might contribute to the function of _PROTEIN_ we assessed the significance of at residue in the _PROTEIN_ domain by replacing it by glutamine in the fusion protein to generate the transgene ubq . the relative abundance of the resulting protein was comparable to the suggesting that this modification was not crucial for either protein stability or turnover in vivo . however the proportion of pngasef sensitive and protein was shifted towards relatively more pngasef sensitive . this suggested that might either be retained in the _LOCATION_ or not be efficiently modified by _LOCATION_ localized remodelling enzymes . in agreement with the former possibility displayed predominant with the _LOCATION_ marker _LOCATION_ with only a minor proportion of localized at the cell periphery . despite the dramatic influence of this highly conserved glycosylation site on protein trafficking the transgene displayed genetic complementation comparable to controls . taken together we show that is highly and that the conserved abutting the _PROTEIN_ domain of _PROTEIN_ plays a crucial role for _LOCATION_ but is not essential for function . of . treatment of oligomannosidic by endo h and release of complex by _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ and the defective _PROTEIN_ background . in _PROTEIN_ becomes fully sensitive to _PROTEIN_ indicating fucosylation and additional processing . the product is only partially sensitive to and _PROTEIN_ while the _LOCATION_ product is fully sensitive to both enzymes indicating that it exclusively contains oligomannosidic . the conserved site is required for normal _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ transit . the substitution mutant shows strongly increased sensitivity to _PROTEIN_ indicating an increased ratio of oligomannosidic to fucosylated complex . a minor residual fraction of _PROTEIN_ resistant product is only detected when blots are . with reticulate _LOCATION_ structures but does not accumulate in fusiform _LOCATION_ bodies . there is so far no direct evidence that _PROTEIN_ contain _PROTEIN_ and no sequence motif precisely predicts proline hydroxylation and . classical _PROTEIN_ contain repeats in their peptide sequence with x typically a ser thr or ala residue preceding hydroxyproline and in all bona fide _PROTEIN_ there are regions in the protein sequence that contain a high combined frequency of pro ala ser and thr _PROTEIN_ . although some _PROTEIN_ such as _PROTEIN_ do not contain repeats all _PROTEIN_ contain one or two domains that display a high local _PROTEIN_ frequency . to obtain direct evidence for the presence of _PROTEIN_ glycans on a functional _PROTEIN_ we probed purified with _PROTEIN_ specific monoclonal antibodies . after a affinity purification of we detected a protein doublet at around kda on a denaturing reducing gel stained with sypro ruby . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of tryptic peptides of the excised double band revealed _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ as only specific proteins in this fraction . an additional band at kda corresponded to ribulose bisphosphate _PROTEIN_ a frequent contaminant due to its great abundance . on protein blots of purified the _PROTEIN_ monoclonal antibodies and reacted with a band at around kda after short film exposures and after longer exposures with a high molecular weight smear while monoclonal antibodies specific for other _PROTEIN_ and cell wall _PROTEIN_ epitopes did not bind to purified . even at very long exposures the signal did not extend below kda . and were previously shown to bind to glycan epitopes on _PROTEIN_ . to further confirm the glycan nature of the epitopes we digested purified with a combination of glycosidases that specifically hydrolyse glycosidic links in type ii _PROTEIN_ . after glycosidase treatment the apparent molecular weight of subtly shifted downwards and the epitope was no longer detected . to exclude the possibility that the detected _PROTEIN_ epitopes might belong to a contaminating _PROTEIN_ with a molecular weight similar to we manipulated the molecular weight of in two alternative ways . first we removed the . as shown in the previous section the removal of of in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background generated two fractions one sharp kda band and a more heterogeneous fraction smearing between and kda . probing pngase f digested _PROTEIN_ only the heterogeneous fraction but not the discrete kda band reacted with and . alternatively we tested antibody reactivity with that was normally processed in the secretory pathway and with that was retained in the _LOCATION_ . the protein reacted with indicating that this variant is . by contrast purified did not react with . together with the _LOCATION_ of this result was consistent with the notion that the epitope was generated in a post _LOCATION_ compartment . both sets of data supported our claim that the detected epitopes were a part of and not a contaminating _PROTEIN_ of similar molecular weight . in brief we directly demonstrated that contains _PROTEIN_ epitopes that are generated in a post _LOCATION_ compartment . carries _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ epitopes . a _PROTEIN_ gel of shows a protein doublet at kda and a single protein band at around kda . out of a variety of _PROTEIN_ monoclonal antibodies only and react with . treatment of with removes reactivity with . both _PROTEIN_ antibodies react with heterogeneous fraction that is _PROTEIN_ sensitive only in the _PROTEIN_ background but not with the minor fraction that is generally _PROTEIN_ sensitive . reacts with and with truncated but not with the _LOCATION_ . what is the functional role of the pr domains on _PROTEIN_ ? in _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ domain contains two clusters of s/tppp while the _PROTEIN_ region _PROTEIN_ contains two proline doublets _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . comparing putative _PROTEIN_ orthologues we found the _PROTEIN_ domain not well conserved except for which was placed five positions upstream the site in all investigated putative _PROTEIN_ orthologues . in the _PROTEIN_ domain the two proline doublets and were conserved in all putative _PROTEIN_ orthologues . we addressed the requirement of pr regions for _PROTEIN_ glycosylation and function by replacing all clustered pro residues with ala in the construct . on western blots the modified fusion protein migrated as subtly downward shifted band and comparing the intensities of independent homozygous transformed lines between and the mutants generally produced weaker signals . consistently a subtle reduction in signal intensity was also observed when seedlings were treated with the inhibitor bipyridyl . the reduced abundance of compared with appeared more dramatic at the cellular level and the mutant protein localized predominantly to pleomorphic intracellular structures and only to a very minor extent to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . similar to truncation constructs however a bright signal emanated from cell corners . with _LOCATION_ was only moderate . by contrast the intracellular fraction of largely with both endosomal markers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . on _PROTEIN_ gels that were run for a sufficiently long duration we observed a kda downward shift in molecular weight of purified compared with . reacted with the ala to pro substituted version and the fusion protein with similar intensity however the smear typically seen at long exposures extended not only to the higher but also the range compared with the _PROTEIN_ product that coincided with the _METHOD_ epitope tag . by contrast the signal produced by the antibody was strongly reduced in the construct . in our initial efforts to purify we had difficulties to detect the protein and had to load relatively large amount of eluate . we roughly assessed the integrity of the purified protein exploiting the decoration of _PROTEIN_ with fucosylated complex glycans and the recognition of these glycans by horseradish peroxidase antibodies . the purified product was strongly and some lower mw bands were weakly detected by the hrp antibody suggesting relatively good integrity of the purified protein . by contrast the signal at the full molecular weight of the variant was strongly reduced in favour of more intense labelling of fragments . together these data suggested that the mutated protein might be more prone to degradation in vivo . despite its effect on protein abundance and stability to our surprise the construct was genetically functional in our complementation assays indicating that pr regions were not essential for the function of _PROTEIN_ in root growth . to summarize the observations made in the previous section substitutions of the most conserved prolines in the pr domains remain inconsequential with respect to genetic role of despite affecting epitope reactivity as well as protein abundance stability and localization . substitution of pro residues in domain affects abundance and localization of . three independent homozygous transformant lines of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are compared on a western blot . line and are compared with identical imaging settings with normal and increased contrast . an shows derived signal in cell corners . with endosomal markers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ while there is only weak overlap with _LOCATION_ . reacts with but not with . labelling with the reacting hrp antibody shows a strong relative increase of small fragments compared to a size reduced fragment .
