glutathione enzymes constitute a family of eight peroxidases in arabidopsis thaliana . in contrast to the eponymous selenocysteine glutathione peroxidases in mammalian cells that use glutathione as electron donor gpxls rely on cysteine instead of selenocysteine for activity and depend on the thioredoxin system for reduction . although plant gpxls have been implicated in important agronomic traits such as drought tolerance photooxidative tolerance and immune responses there remain major ambiguities _PROTEIN_ their subcellular localization . because their site of action is a prerequisite for an understanding of their function we investigated the localization of all eight gpxls in stable arabidopsis lines _PROTEIN_ and fusions with green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ using confocal microscopy . and were found in _LOCATION_ while and are _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the target peptide of is sufficient to direct _METHOD_ into mitochondria . interestingly and all appear to be _LOCATION_ bound . was found exclusively in the secretory pathway where it is anchored by a single transmembrane domain . and are anchored to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . presence of an myristoylation motif and genetic disruption of _LOCATION_ association through targeted mutagenesis point to myristoylation as essential for _LOCATION_ localization .
the arabidopsis genome encodes eight gpxl _METHOD_ which have been predicted to be localized in different subcellular compartments . different bioinformatics _METHOD_ however lead to different predictions and where available experimental evidence is frequently inconsistent with predictions . the amino acid alignment suggests the presence of targeting signals for and . while the sequences of and have been associated with a strong probability of _LOCATION_ targeting the situation is more ambiguous for . the highest scoring prediction is mitochondria but some _METHOD_ also predict the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ as putative targets . contains a short amino acids long extension compared with and . most bioinformatics _METHOD_ interpret the first amino acids of this extension as a mitochondrial targeting signal to guide the mature protein to the mitochondrial import machinery . this however contrasts with experimental evidence for the _LOCATION_ the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . all other gpxls are predicted to be localized at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or the _LOCATION_ but again experimental evidence from proteome analyses and protein protein interaction studies is not always consistent with the predictions . to investigate the subcellular targeting of gpxls fusion proteins with _METHOD_ were generated and initially _PROTEIN_ transiently in tobacco leaves . _METHOD_ can be imaged as a conventional _METHOD_ but it has the additional feature of reducing and oxidizing subcellular compartments which can allow of _LOCATION_ protein topology . glutathione enzyme has been identified as a _LOCATION_ protein more than a decade ago . ambiguity results from proteome studies that have reported to reside at the chloroplast envelope or on _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to experimentally resolve the subcellular localization was tagged with _METHOD_ . the _METHOD_ was exploited as a simple _METHOD_ and imaged together with chlorophyll _METHOD_ . all images from parenchyma cells revealed of _METHOD_ with chlorophyll _METHOD_ depicted as a yellow merge colour . epidermal pavement cell chloroplasts with low chlorophyll content appear green in the merge image . even distribution of _METHOD_ suggests localization of the fusion protein in the stroma rather than to the _LOCATION_ . this conclusion is further supported by the visualization of _METHOD_ stromules protruding from chloroplasts in tobacco leaf epidermal cells . glutathione enzyme is also predicted to be targeted to _LOCATION_ but this localization has not been explored experimentally . fusions of with _METHOD_ resulted in _LOCATION_ localization again with identification of individual epidermal _LOCATION_ that displayed a strong _METHOD_ signal in the background of low chlorophyll signal . glutathione enzymes and both lack obvious target peptides and were predicted to localize in the _LOCATION_ . for experimental validation both proteins were tagged with _METHOD_ and stably _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . ratiometric analysis of a _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ control results in low nm _METHOD_ excitation ratios indicating a reduced _METHOD_ sensor in blue . a _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ lumen control shows high nm _METHOD_ excitation ratios indicating an oxidized _METHOD_ false coloured in red . given the pronounced ratio difference resulting in a binary readout no further quantitative analysis is necessary although the spatial pattern of _METHOD_ signal may be used for independent validation . for both and the fused _METHOD_ displayed low _METHOD_ ratios confirming localization in the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ . to further exclude the possibility of cryptic targeting signals for _LOCATION_ both proteins were also fused to the of _METHOD_ and transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaves . these fusion constructs were also found in the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ . the protein sequence of indicates an amino acid stretch that is interpreted as a mitochondrial targeting signal by most bioinformatics _METHOD_ . and fusions with _METHOD_ were initially _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaves . while the fusion was found in the _LOCATION_ and the nucleoplasm the fusion preferentially labelled the _LOCATION_ network with the _PROTEIN_ appearance of the _LOCATION_ envelope as a characteristic structure . the _METHOD_ tag however remained reduced indicating that the fusion protein decorated the _LOCATION_ face of the endomembranes . in contrast to the complete absence of mitochondrial targeting in tobacco stable _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ in arabidopsis resulted in partial targeting to the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ as visualized through of _METHOD_ with the mitochondrial marker tmrm . in addition _METHOD_ was found in the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ and occasionally in highly _PROTEIN_ lines again on the _LOCATION_ face of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to further test for the function of the putative targeting signal the first amino acids were fused to the of _METHOD_ . stable _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ in arabidopsis resulted in clear mitochondrial localization as indicated by strict with the tmrm signal . to determine the subcellular localization of and _METHOD_ was fused to the of both proteins . while transient _PROTEIN_ of these proteins in tobacco resulted in _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ localization stable _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis consistently resulted in exclusive localization of the fusion proteins to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the fused _METHOD_ remained reduced in all cases indicating localization on the _LOCATION_ face of the _LOCATION_ . _LOCATION_ localization of both constructs was confirmed through with the _LOCATION_ marker . the of both and resemble the classical myristoylation motif mgxxxsxx . based on gpxl sequences from land plants margis et al . generated a phylogenetic tree and found five distinct clades based on four putative gene duplications during early land plant evolution . and were generated by an additional gene duplication during angiosperm evolution and both belong to the same cluster that was annotated as _LOCATION_ . more detailed sequence analysis of the clade highlighted that all representatives of this clade contained the myristoylation motif . as a result gly may get myristoylated during translation after cleavage of the met enabling anchoring to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to test the hypothesis of the playing a role in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization we first masked the putative myristoylaton site by fusing _METHOD_ to the of and respectively . in tobacco these constructs strictly labelled endomembranes including the _LOCATION_ envelope with a reduced _METHOD_ . when _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were stably transformed into arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ of the fusion proteins was very low but still they appeared predominantly on endomembranes including the _LOCATION_ envelope with _METHOD_ facing the _LOCATION_ indicated by the blue/greenish false colour of the ratio images . to further assess the role for myristoylation _PROTEIN_ mutant variants of and were generated and fused with _METHOD_ . in arabidopsis both of these fusion proteins were not found at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ anymore . instead they remained soluble in the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ of with _METHOD_ fused to its in tobacco leaves resulted in the observation of punctate structures . despite prediction of as a mitochondrial protein no with tmrm could be found . to minimize the risk of possible mistargeting resulting from heterologous _PROTEIN_ both and fusion proteins of with _METHOD_ were stably _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . as in tobacco leaves _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ in arabidopsis resulted in a punctate labelling pattern but surprisingly ratiometric analysis of the _METHOD_ tag indicated oxidizing conditions in the respective compartment . _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ resulted in labelling of endomembranes including the _LOCATION_ envelope . in this case however the _METHOD_ tag appeared to be largely reduced . taken together the ratiometric analysis of and fusions of with _METHOD_ strongly suggests that is targeted to the _LOCATION_ and/or the _LOCATION_ and that the protein contains a transmembrane domain which anchors the protein to the _LOCATION_ . localization of fusion proteins in the _LOCATION_ apparatus was confirmed by with the _LOCATION_ marker mannosidase _METHOD_ protein . indeed the protein sequence of contains an extension of amino acids that includes a highly hydrophobic domain between amino acid and . together with few neighbouring amino acids this domain may constitute a tmd that anchors to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . a tmd would be consistent with the binary response of fused _METHOD_ being reduced and fused _METHOD_ being oxidized . the first amino acids of were found to be sufficient to target _METHOD_ to the secretory pathway where it labelled the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ . deletion of the first amino acids from resulted in a soluble protein localized in the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ .
