metacaspases are distant relatives of the metazoan _PROTEIN_ found in plants fungi and protists . however in contrast with _PROTEIN_ information about the physiological substrates of metacaspases is still scarce . by means of n terminal combined fractional diagonal chromatography the physiological substrates of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were identified in young seedlings of arabidopsis thaliana on the proteome wide level providing additional insight into _PROTEIN_ cleavage specificity and revealing a previously unknown preference for acidic residues at the substrate prime site position . the functionalities of the identified _PROTEIN_ substrates hinted at metacaspase functions other than those related to cell death . these results allowed us to resolve the substrate specificity of _PROTEIN_ in more detail and indicated that the activity of phosphoenolpyruvate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a key enzyme in _PROTEIN_ is enhanced upon _PROTEIN_ dependent proteolysis .
the spatiotemporal _PROTEIN_ of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ was studied in gus reporter lines by means of _PROTEIN_ histochemical analysis . several independent homozygous alleles were analyzed with similar results . interestingly the _PROTEIN_ promoter activity was already obvious in root caps of young d old seedlings remained the same in week old seedlings and was observed also in epidermal cells . in hypocotyls and cotyledons but not in rosette leaves discrete differentiating primary and secondary tracheary elements were also stained . in _PROTEIN_ a strong signal appeared just prior to abscission . anther connectives also displayed strong _PROTEIN_ promoter activity . by quantitative rt pcr we assessed the _PROTEIN_ of all nine arabidopsis metacaspases in d old seedlings of wild type columbia and in the t dna insertion knockout and _PROTEIN_ overexpression _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines . both _PROTEIN_ gain of function or loss of function plants did not display any obvious aberrant phenotypes under normal vegetative or reproductive growth conditions . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was the highest consistent with a previous report that it is the most _PROTEIN_ metacaspase at various growth stages . in young seedlings corresponding to a developmentally active stage with a dynamic proteome the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was the second highest therefore this stage was chosen for analysis of the _PROTEIN_ degradome . to explore the function of _PROTEIN_ through identification of its physiological protein substrates we used the n terminal _PROTEIN_ technique . in contrast with most proteomic approaches n terminal _PROTEIN_ is a positional proteomics technology that uses sequential peptide chromatography to enrich for those peptides that contain the protein n termini out of the whole peptide mixture obtained by for instance full trypsin digestion of proteomes . here this so called n terminome consisted of all peptides that possessed the mature protein n termini and the neo n termini that had been generated upon proteolysis by _PROTEIN_ . neo n termini that emerged at _PROTEIN_ processing sites directly conveyed the _PROTEIN_ proteolytic events and the exact site where the protein cleavage occurred . we analyzed the in vivo n terminome of d old seedlings of wild type and _PROTEIN_ gain of function and loss of function transgenic plants . first the n terminome of the t dna insertion knockout seedlings was compared with that of wild type seedlings and second to that of seedlings overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . additionally a seedling proteome to which arabidopsis recombinant _PROTEIN_ had been added in vitro was studied versus an untreated control . to compare the n terminomes n hydroxysuccinimide esters of light and heavy isotopic variants of butyric acid were used to _METHOD_ tag the n terminal peptides . this differential labeling strategy was possible because _PROTEIN_ introduced novel primary amino groups that were uniquely tagged with either a light or heavy variant of butyric acid . after this _METHOD_ tagging equal amounts of the proteome preparations were mixed and digested with trypsin and n terminal peptides were isolated with n terminal _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ tagging of neo n termini enabled us to determine the proteome origin of each labeled peptide . the respective ion signal intensities were further used to identify the _PROTEIN_ processed sites . the following _METHOD_ readouts were expected some n terminal peptides would be found at equal intensity in both samples . such peptides might carry the mature protein n terminus and would not be indicative of _PROTEIN_ proteolysis . furthermore such n terminal peptides would imply that the particular protein was not up or downregulated in the tested proteomes . some neo n terminal peptides would occur in both samples but with a significantly higher intensity in the sample with either the active _PROTEIN_ or the supplemented . this outcome would mean that the corresponding proteins were also cleaved in the control sample _PROTEIN_ although to a lesser extent by another protease hinting at a redundant protease activity . such events could be explained by a scenario in which the _PROTEIN_ perturbation activated other proteases . some neo n terminal peptides would be uniquely found in the proteome either with the active _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or supplemented with implying that the corresponding proteins were cleaved by _PROTEIN_ . peptides were analyzed with an ltq orbitrap xl _METHOD_ spectrometer . the obtained tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ spectra were searched against the arabidopsis information resource database with the mascot algorithm and subsequently mapped to the database with dbtoolkit . in total _METHOD_ spectra were generated in the analysis in the _PROTEIN_ analysis and in the in vitro analysis identifying and peptides and converging to and proteins respectively . the ratios of light/heavy peptide signals for all identified peptides were calculated with the mascot distiller software and were individually checked for possible neo n terminal peptides pointing to _PROTEIN_ processing . we focused on two classes of peptides the significantly enriched neo n terminal peptides and the unique peptides in the col _PROTEIN_ or treated seedling proteomes in comparison to . as the former might also appear because of differential protein levels in the input proteomes we scanned the data for the corresponding precursor protein n termini or other neo n terminal peptides from these precursor proteins which were not cleaved by _PROTEIN_ . comparison of these peptide levels led us to conclude that no large proteome changes occurred between the different proteomes assayed . for an overview of all cleavage sites their corresponding substrates and their precursor protein n termini identified in the three analyses see supplemental data sets to online . after filtering the data with the known _PROTEIN_ specificity for arg and lys of all processed sites matched the expected _PROTEIN_ specificity without significant enrichment for a particular amino acid in the other processing events . in total cleavage events after arg or lys _PROTEIN_ were identified in proteins _PROTEIN_ from which approximately one third were reported as singleton peptides in either col _PROTEIN_ or treated proteomes _PROTEIN_ and as significantly enriched peptides in the same proteomes _PROTEIN_ using icelogo we inspected the amino acid sequences at the prime and nonprime substrate positions of the arg and lys specific cleavage sites and analyzed the frequencies of specific residues after statistical correction by means of the natural occurrence of amino acids in arabidopsis proteins . the specificity information derived from the three data sets was very similar . the large in vitro _PROTEIN_ data set showed that the acidic residues asp and glu were often found at neighboring positions to the basic cleavage site . for instance in and of the lys cleaved and arg cleaved sequences respectively the position was occupied by asp or glu and likewise the position in and of the lys cleaved and arg cleaved sequences respectively . however only in and of the lys cleaved and arg cleaved sequences respectively both and were acidic . at the prime site asp or glu was also observed in of the cases at . at the small amino acids thr ala and val occurred in of all cases whereas ala was tolerated at every position . analogous to the in vivo _PROTEIN_ derived specificity val and glu were preferred at and lys and arg were frequently found at . ala and thr were the sole preferred residues at in the in vivo cleaved substrates but in vitro cleaved proteins additionally tolerated asp and glu at this position . _PROTEIN_ the prime site substrate specificity of _PROTEIN_ the in vivo and in vitro data were largely similar except for the amino acid tolerance at in the latter small residues were present at this position whereas aromatic residues such as phe and tyr and the aliphatic ile and leu were found also in the former . in conclusion the _PROTEIN_ specificity for basic residues at the site was accompanied by a strong preference for acidic amino acids at the site . this particular trend of acidic basic amino acid combinations was also seen at other positions at the nonprime site whereas ala was generally tolerated at every position . a relative preference occurred for lys over arg at the site and in vivo often a second arg or lys at . for instance when lys was present at of these substrates contained a second lys at . previously in a positional scanning of a synthetic combinatorial library of amino methylcoumarin labeled synthetic tetrapeptides spanning the positions vrpr was found as the most preferred tetrapeptide substrate whereas iisk the best cleaved peptide with lys at was fivefold less efficiently cleaved than vrpr . our current results somewhat contrast with the stronger preference for arg over lys at but they are in agreement with the preferred presence of a dibasic amino acid motif as in vrpr . when the two in vitro approaches _PROTEIN_ were compared val was the most prevalent residue at in both data sets of arg cleaved substrates . however a major difference was observed at the site the _PROTEIN_ data indicated that thr and asp were preferred and the ps scl data showed a preference for hydrophobic residues or pro . based on the in vivo and in vitro amino acid frequencies at the substrate positions derived from the _PROTEIN_ analyses two revised consensus sequences of the _PROTEIN_ substrate specificity are proposed for either cleavage after arg and lys namely and to detect the _PROTEIN_ activity in biochemical assays . by means of genomenet and motif search we screened the arabidopsis proteome for the presence of these sequences . the number of protein hits varied depending on the length of the motif . in _PROTEIN_ the sequences and were found in more than and protein hits respectively . nevertheless these observations are based only on the sequences of the queried proteins and do not take into account whether any of the predicted motifs are solvent accessible or reside in a secondary structure element not readily recognized by the protease . for the experimental validation of the _PROTEIN_ substrates we prioritized all in vivo singleton peptides together with those proteins bearing cleavage sites identified in more than one proteomic analysis . in this manner sites in different proteins were selected for cleavage validation from which sites were identical in the three different setups sites in both in vivo analyses sites between the in vivo and the in vitro analysis and finally sites between the _PROTEIN_ in vivo and the in vitro analysis . the remaining sites were reported as in vivo singleton peptides . two independent validation approaches were chosen . first amino acid peptides harboring the identified cleavage sites were synthesized for six randomly selected candidate protein substrates and used for in vitro cleavage assays . second in vitro transcribed and translated radiolabeled proteins generated from available cdna clones _PROTEIN_ were incubated with and their digestion products were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and autoradiography . after incubation with increasing concentrations of synthetic peptides and their digestion products were separated by reverse phase hplc and analyzed by _PROTEIN_ assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . peptides spanning the _PROTEIN_ cleavage sites identified in trypsin inhibitor _PROTEIN_ general regulatory _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gly rich rna binding protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase b _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were cleaved by at the sites identified by _PROTEIN_ . the degree of peptide processing increased with increasing concentrations . for proteins containing more than one identified cleavage site such as the _PROTEIN_ embryogenesis abundant _PROTEIN_ domain containing protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ two synthetic peptides were tested . all these peptides were cleaved by at the sites identified by _PROTEIN_ . however additional alternative cleavage sites were observed as well probably due to sequence similarities with the _PROTEIN_ deduced sites . for instance the additional cleavage site in the _PROTEIN_ domain containing protein precursor was identical to the _PROTEIN_ deduced site . as for _PROTEIN_ the peptide precursor was originally expected to be cleaved at the _PROTEIN_ site but was additionally processed at a similar site because in both cases k was adjacent to an acidic residue . furthermore the consensus sequence for lys cleaved peptides supported the preference for acidic residues either at the n terminal or c terminal side of the cleaved lys . to validate experimentally the substrate cleavages at the protein level we employed in vitro transcription and translation coupled assays . in total we successfully translated proteins all of which were cleaved by . although the precursor protein levels clearly _PROTEIN_ or even were completely negligible after the treatment for some substrates cleavage fragments were not always observed . it is possible that the substrate fragments were not detectable by autoradiography because they did not contain a radiolabeled met or that proteolytic fragments < kd might have been too small for proper separation and visualization by the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ system used . the substrates that were processed into fragments of correctly predicted molecular weight based on the cleavage site previously identified by _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ were _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide synthetase _PROTEIN_ gdp mannose dehydratase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pentatricopeptide repeat _PROTEIN_ containing protein _PROTEIN_ and citrate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . furthermore these proteins were not cleaved by the inactive mutant indicating that the observed fragments were indeed due to and not to other proteases present in the assay mixture . _PROTEIN_ which catalyzes the reversible _PROTEIN_ dependent decarboxylation of oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate is involved in _PROTEIN_ photosynthetic _PROTEIN_ concentrating _METHOD_ during photosynthesis crassulacean acid metabolism and nitrogenous compound metabolism . as _PROTEIN_ is posttranslationaly regulated by reversible phosphorylation and prone to rapid proteolytic cleavage in planta which gives rise to fragments with sizes that correlate to the cleavage sites observed by n terminal _PROTEIN_ we focused on the _PROTEIN_ dependent _PROTEIN_ cleavage . to this end we assessed whether _PROTEIN_ was responsible for in planta cleavage of _PROTEIN_ which is highly active during germination at the d old seedling stage of the studied proteome . _PROTEIN_ polypeptides were previously immunodetected in arabidopsis cotyledons with a polyclonal antiserum raised against _PROTEIN_ from guinea grass leaves . similarly in pea cotyledons besides the mature kd form a smaller kd _PROTEIN_ polypeptide was detected that was attributed either to a genuine isoform or to a regulatory protein processing event . recently the pineapple _PROTEIN_ had been found to have two active polypeptide variants of and kd in vivo . in cucumber an in vivo phosphorylation site is located in the proteolytically removed n terminal fragment . in guinea grass the activity of the full length phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ was lower than that of the full length or truncated dephosphorylated _PROTEIN_ indicating that removal of the phosphorylation site containing n terminal region might restore the _PROTEIN_ activity . cleavage of _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ in vivo and in vitro at lys and arg led to c terminal fragments of and kd respectively . with rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against the recombinant arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ we monitored the _PROTEIN_ processing in _PROTEIN_ gain of function and loss of function mutants . protein extracts of col and _PROTEIN_ from d old seedlings were prepared under postlytic proteolysis inhibiting conditions directly mixed with the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ loading buffer and heated before protein gel blot analysis with anti _PROTEIN_ . the kd precursor protein was processed in the _PROTEIN_ extracts whereas in col or extracts it remained predominantly intact . smaller cross reactive fragments of to kd were equally abundant in col and _PROTEIN_ extracts implying that they could result from another protease activity or degradation . taken together our data indicate that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ increased the _PROTEIN_ processing in vivo . to assess the effect of the _PROTEIN_ dependent _PROTEIN_ cleavage we measured the _PROTEIN_ activity of _PROTEIN_ in young seedling extracts of col _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ gain of function and loss of function mutants . _PROTEIN_ activity was the highest in _PROTEIN_ plant extracts revealing that _PROTEIN_ cleavage enhanced _PROTEIN_ activity and that proteolysis might remove the putative _PROTEIN_ inhibitory phosphorylation site . as _PROTEIN_ is involved in suc synthesis from lipids during oilseed plant germination the _PROTEIN_ mutants are impaired in hypocotyl elongation when grown in the dark in suc deprived growth media . hence under these conditions we monitored the hypocotyl elongation of _PROTEIN_ col and _PROTEIN_ for a period of d after germination . as expected _PROTEIN_ hypocotyls were the smallest and the hypocotyl growth was significantly compromised in comparison to that of col . reciprocally _PROTEIN_ hypocotyls were the longest _PROTEIN_ . these results are indicative of a positive regulatory effect of _PROTEIN_ on the _PROTEIN_ activity during _PROTEIN_ . because of the apparent discrepancy between the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ and the detection of _PROTEIN_ in the apoplast of _PROTEIN_ lines we reassessed the subcellular localizations of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ by transiently _PROTEIN_ n and c terminal green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaves . _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins were exclusively localized in the _LOCATION_ and n and c terminal _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins in the nucleocytoplasm but not in the apoplast possibly due to the _METHOD_ instability in the acidic apoplast environment . to exclude that the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ signal was due to diffusion of free _METHOD_ after proteolytic processing of the fusion protein we evaluated the integrity of the _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins by protein gel blot analysis . an kd _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein was found that corresponded with the kd _METHOD_ protein fused with the large subunit of _PROTEIN_ . in this case the small subunit was removed after autocatalytic activation of the protease indicating that _PROTEIN_ was active in the observed subcellular compartments . for the c terminal _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion an kd protein correlated with the full length of the fusion protein revealing that the _METHOD_ fusion at the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ might have interfered with the proteolytic separation of the two subunits . however _PROTEIN_ localized in the same cellular compartments irrespective of the _METHOD_ fusion conformations . to confirm the nucleocytoplasmic localization of _PROTEIN_ we additionally analyzed arabidopsis roots of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ reporter lines . interestingly the localization of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm of epidermal cells was confirmed . altogether our localization study demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ besides its apoplastic location is also present in _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm .
gus reporter lines were generated as described in supplemental methods online and plants at different stages were used for the _PROTEIN_ analysis of _PROTEIN_ . in summary whole plants or separate organs were incubated in acetone for min at room temperature washed in _PROTEIN_ ph and then incubated in mg/ml bromo chloro indolyl d _PROTEIN_ mm ferricyanide and mm ferrocyanide in mm phosphate buffer ph at in the dark for h to overnight . the material was cleared with lactate solution and observed under stereomicroscopy and conventional light microscopy . total rna was extracted from d old seedlings as described with modifications . cdna was prepared with the iscript cdna synthesis kit according to the manufacturer s instructions . real time quantitative pcr was performed in a final volume of including of eightfold diluted cdna nm of each primer and green mix with an icycler instrument according to the manufacturer s instructions . the housekeeping gene ubiquitin c _PROTEIN_ was used as internal reference and for normalization of transcript levels . the gene specific primer sequences used for the quantitative rt pcr are listed in supplemental table online . for a detailed description see supplemental methods online . seeds of arabidopsis thaliana accession col the _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion line _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ overexpression line were placed in round plastic plates containing wet whatman paper for stratification at in the dark . after d seeds were transferred to with a h h dark photoperiod with to light intensity and left to germinate for h. young seedlings including seed coats were collected frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground into a fine powder with mortar and pestle . to achieve a total protein content of mg g frozen ground tissue was resuspended in ml buffer containing propanesulfonate deoxycholate _PROTEIN_ mm ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and glycerol in _PROTEIN_ ph further containing the suggested amount of protease inhibitor mixture according to the manufacturer s instructions . the sample was centrifuged at for min at and guanidinium hydrochloride was added to the cleared supernatant to reach a final concentration of m. for the in vitro _PROTEIN_ analysis protein extracts were prepared in the _PROTEIN_ optimal activity buffer consisting of mm mes ph mm nacl suc chaps and mm dithiothreitol . four _METHOD_ of total seedling protein extract was incubated at with recombinant _PROTEIN_ for a total duration of h every min of fresh protease was preactivated in the same optimal activity buffer at room temperature for min and then added to the protein extract to a total amount of protease . enzyme activity was units and one unit corresponded to the enzyme activity that catalyzes the hydrolysis of vrpr amc per min at . the same procedure was used for the control sample but without addition of . by means of the gel analysis option in the imagej software the level of endogenous _PROTEIN_ protein in col extracts was estimated to be fold lower than that in _PROTEIN_ extracts and fold lower than the total amount of recombinant _PROTEIN_ used in the in vitro _PROTEIN_ analysis . protein concentrations were measured with the dc protein assay and protein extracts were further modified for n terminal _PROTEIN_ analysis as described . all free amines either preexisting or generated upon proteolysis and all amines were blocked with n hydroxysuccinimide esters of butyric acid stable isotopic variants . for the analysis of the in vivo generated samples primary amines in the proteome were butyrylated whereas col or _PROTEIN_ primary amines were butyrylated . for the in vitro analysis primary amines in the treated sample were butyrylated and the untreated proteome was butyrylated . after equal amounts of the labeled proteomes had been mixed tryptic digestion generated internal non n terminal peptides that were removed by strong cation exchange at low ph . after reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography peptide separations with trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid modification internal peptides were further depleted and n terminal peptides were isolated . finally liquid chromatography _METHOD_ analysis was used for peptide identification and quantification . given that lys residues were all butyrylated and therefore uncleavable by trypsin we expected to identify only tryptic peptides generated after arg . therefore in the search settings with one missed cleavage allowance endoproteinase semi arg c/p was used that allows the identification of neo n terminal peptides generated after arg c cleavage at one terminus and cleavage events between arg and pro as well . variable modifications were set to pyroglutamate formation of n terminal gln and fixed modifications included met oxidation to its sulfoxide derivative s _PROTEIN_ of cys and butyrylation of the lys side chain and peptide n termini . identified peptides were quantified with the mascot distiller toolbox _PROTEIN_ in the precursor mode . cdna clones received from the _PROTEIN_ were used as templates for in vitro transcription and translation of radiolabeled proteins according to the manufacturer s instructions . translation products were prepared in reactions and one tenth was used for each digestion . the production of the recombinant _PROTEIN_ protease has been described previously and a range of concentrations prepared in the _PROTEIN_ activity buffer were included in the digestions . the reactions were incubated at for min . the inactive _PROTEIN_ mutant was used as a negative control . one tenth of the digestion assay products was separated with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . these gels were dried and exposed to phospho imaging plates and scanned by a phosphor imager . pageruler prestained protein ladder was used as protein marker and apparent molecular weight was calculated with imagej software the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ open reading frame was amplified by pcr from cdna of col seeds extended to complete and gateway cloning sites and cloned into the bacterial protein _PROTEIN_ vector . bacterial protein production was induced in luria broth growing cultures of successfully transformed bacterial clones with mm isopropyl d thiogalactopyranoside at overnight . denatured _PROTEIN_ protein was isolated from protein inclusion bodies and subsequently purified on his select nickel affinity gel resin in a buffer consisting of mm sodium phosphate mm nacl and m urea . for the production of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ antibodies mg of purified recombinant protein was injected four times as antigen into each rabbit . the rabbit antiserum was used at a dilution for _PROTEIN_ immunodetection in plant extracts . proteins were immunodetected in d old arabidopsis seedling extracts prepared in chaps deoxycholate _PROTEIN_ mm ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and glycerol in _PROTEIN_ at ph and containing the suggested amount of protease inhibitor mixture according to the manufacturer s instructions . extracts were centrifuged at for min at and cleared supernatants were immediately mixed with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ loading buffer and heated at for min . of the protein extract was used for the immunodetection of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ . for reprobing purposes immobilon p _LOCATION_ were stripped with m mercapoethanol _PROTEIN_ and mm tris hcl ph . immunoreactive proteins were visualized with a chemiluminescence kit . seeds were set to germinate on wet whatman paper for d at after a d stratification period at in the dark . sampling included the remaining seed coats . the _PROTEIN_ activity of _PROTEIN_ was measured spectrophotometrically at nm as previously described on uv star well plates . one unit of _PROTEIN_ activity corresponded to the production of product per min at . the values represent the mean of five measurements confidence interval . during the hypocotyl elongation experiments seeds were sown on half strength murashige and skoog salts without suc and then stratified for d at in the dark . prior to transfer to a lovibond incubator seeds were exposed for min to light . hypocotyl lengths were measured to the nearest millimeter with the imagej software . n and c terminal _METHOD_ fusions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were generated as described in supplemental methods
