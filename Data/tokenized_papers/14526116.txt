peroxiredoxins are thiol dependent antioxidants containing one or two conserved cys residues that protect lipids enzymes and dna against reactive oxygen species . in plants the cys prxs are highly _PROTEIN_ during _PROTEIN_ seed development and the _PROTEIN_ pattern is dormancy related in mature seeds . we have _PROTEIN_ the arabidopsis cys prx _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli and show that this protein has antioxidant activity in vitro and protects e. coli in vivo against the toxic oxidant cumene hydroperoxide . although some cys prxs are targeted to the _LOCATION_ a green _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was also localized to the cytoplasm in an onion epidermis subcellular localization assay . it has been proposed that seed prxs are involved in _PROTEIN_ of dormancy and/or protect the embryo and aleurone layer surviving desiccation against damage caused by reactive oxygen species . these hypotheses were tested using transgenic arabidopsis lines overexpressing the barley cys _PROTEIN_ protein and lines with reduced levels of _PROTEIN_ due to antisensing or rna interference . we found no correlation between prx levels and the duration of the after ripening period required before germination . thus prxs are unlikely to contribute to _PROTEIN_ of dormancy . rna interference lines almost devoid of _PROTEIN_ protein developed and germinated normally under standard growth room conditions . however seeds from lines overexpressing _PROTEIN_ were less inclined to germinate than wild type seeds in the presence of nacl mannitol and methyl viologen suggesting that prx can sense harsh environmental surroundings and play a part in the inhibition of germination under unfavorable conditions .
antioxidant activity of a purified and concentrated _PROTEIN_ fusion protein produced using the pinpoint system was tested in a dna protection assay i.e . dna was exposed to a mixed function oxidation assay where ros is generated due to the presence of . protection of plasmid dna against cleavage by radicals produced in the system increased with increasing concentrations of _PROTEIN_ fusion protein . in a h reaction a substantial protection against degradation was evident with to ml . in comparison the dna was totally degraded without addition of fusion protein or in the presence of ml bsa . however the fusion protein did not give full protection against nicking and degradation . even with ml protein nicking of plasmid dna was evident after h when exposed to or compared with the unnicked supercoiled plasmid . after h complete dna degradation was seen also in the presence of _PROTEIN_ . antioxidant activity of _PROTEIN_ was also tested in vivo . the _PROTEIN_ pinpoint fusion protein was used to produce polyclonal antibodies against _PROTEIN_ . the inframe _PROTEIN_ cdna construct _PROTEIN_ and the cdna cloned out of frame in the pinpoint vector system were introduced into escherichia coli cells . protein isolated from bacteria harboring the nonsense construct confirmed that this construct did not _PROTEIN_ a full length _PROTEIN_ protein . the polyclonal antiserum does however recognize the pinpoint tag . in bacteria with the _PROTEIN_ construct _PROTEIN_ antiserum detected a protein of the expected size corresponding to the _PROTEIN_ fusion protein purified by means of the n terminal pinpoint tag . the e. coli cells were tested for survival in the presence of the toxic oxidant cumene hydroperoxide in an assay previously used to show in vivo antioxidant activity of the cys prx of barley _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ increased the tolerance of the bacteria to cumene hydroperoxide . less than one half of the bacteria harboring the nonsense construct survived min of exposure to mm cumene hydroperoxide compared with of the bacteria _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . plant cys prxs have been suggested to contain a bipartite nls at the end . analysis of the _PROTEIN_ sequence using psort and predictnls predicted cytoplasmic localization to be most likely for _PROTEIN_ . to investigate this aspect further intracellular localization of _PROTEIN_ in a c terminal fusion with the _METHOD_ was examined in a transient _PROTEIN_ assay in onion epidermal cells . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct as well as _METHOD_ and a positive control for _LOCATION_ localization the cdna of heterochromatin of fruitfly cloned in frame with _METHOD_ were introduced into the inner epidermis of onion using particle bombardment . _METHOD_ showed a strong signal restricted to the _LOCATION_ . in contrast the _METHOD_ on its own is present in the cytoplasm and in the _LOCATION_ . the _LOCATION_ localization is thought to result from diffusion because the _METHOD_ protein is smaller than to kd . the signal distribution of the approximately kd _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was comparable with that of the approximately kd _METHOD_ . to investigate the relationship between cys prx level and _PROTEIN_ of dormancy we generated transgenic arabidopsis plants that overexpressed the barley cys prx _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and plants with down regulation of the _PROTEIN_ level using an _PROTEIN_ antisense construct _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ in independent _PROTEIN_ transformants were tested by immunodetection with _PROTEIN_ antiserum on western blots with protein isolated from mature seeds . the _PROTEIN_ antiserum does not crossreact with the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ protein . two transgenic lines with equally high _PROTEIN_ levels were used in a germination test . the _PROTEIN_ transcript level in seeds of these lines did not differ significantly from wt seeds . siliques were harvested at the same stage of maturity i.e . the first three brown dried and just opened siliques were collected . at the point of harvest these seeds are completely dormant . seeds from such siliques were sown every d after harvest and germination frequencies were scored d after sowing . in the wt _PROTEIN_ ecotype germination frequencies are slowly increasing with the number of days of after ripening . after to d germination frequencies begin to increase more rapidly and germination is reached at d of after ripening . after d more than of the seeds germinate . the _PROTEIN_ line showed a similar germination pattern as wt seeds whereas _PROTEIN_ line needed longer time of after ripening to reach a similar germination frequency . however after d of the line seeds also germinated . the _PROTEIN_ levels are not significantly different in the two lines . thus differences in germination profiles can not be attributed to barley cys prx but can possibly be attributed to different genomic insertion positions of the t dnas in the two _PROTEIN_ lines . the variation in germination frequency between seeds of individual wt plants or transgenic plants of the same line reflected by the sd can be attributed to environmental variance . to test whether a reduction in _PROTEIN_ level reduced dormancy lines transformed with the antisense _PROTEIN_ construct was used . mrna was isolated from mature seeds of different lines and the level of mrna investigated by northern hybridization . the lines to showed from to reduction in mrna level compared with wt seeds . germination tests were performed in the same manner as for the _PROTEIN_ lines . average germination frequencies after d of imbibition of seeds sown d after harvest was lower than that of wt seeds for two lines with transcript levels of and however only significant for one line . for three lines among them line with a transcript reduction of germination frequencies were comparable with wt . after d of after ripening there was a variation in germination frequencies from to . however the frequencies did not correlate to the level of _PROTEIN_ in the seeds . because the antisense construct only to a limited extent lowered _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels an rna interference construct _PROTEIN_ was made . two copies of the _PROTEIN_ cdna were cloned in inverse orientations on each side of a stuffer fragment . transcription from the promoter would make possible the generation of a double stranded _PROTEIN_ cdna intended for down regulation of the endogenous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by rnai . arabidopsis plants transformed with this construct were tested for mrna and protein _PROTEIN_ levels . two independent lines with significantly lowered mrna levels at _PROTEIN_ and in mature seeds were selected for further experiments . as anticipated the protein levels detectable by the antiserum specific for _PROTEIN_ were drastically reduced in these two lines . no obvious phenotype e.g . embryo lethality or morphological changes was detected in the primary rnai transformants or their progeny plants that also had drastically reduced _PROTEIN_ levels . the seeds developed normally and the dormancy level correlated closely to that of seeds from wt plants grown and harvested at the same time as the rnai lines . in after ripened seeds the germination frequencies were similar i.e . between and . the number of abnormal germinating seedlings was not significantly different either between _PROTEIN_ lines and the wt or between the rnai lines and _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines . only one of our tests indicated a role for _PROTEIN_ . mature after ripened thus non dormant _PROTEIN_ seeds were germinated under ionic osmotic stress and nonionic osmotic stress which both are known to inhibit germination . on average a slightly higher germination frequency was observed for the rnai lines compared with wt seeds grown and harvested at the same point of time both on nacl and on mannitol . at a concentration of mm mannitol the rnai lines germinated significantly faster than wt four days after sowing and of the total number of germinating rnai seeds had already germinated compared with only of the total germinating wt seeds . total germination frequencies after d were and for the _PROTEIN_ rnai lines while for the wt seeds . this suggested that _PROTEIN_ normally contributes to inhibition of germination under harsh conditions . to further investigate the influence of seed cys prx levels under conditions shown to inhibit germination we compared germination frequencies between seeds from wt and _PROTEIN_ lines . germination frequencies were scored on to mm nacl to mm mannitol and to mv a compound known to create superoxide anions and . on the lowest concentrations of nacl used germination frequencies of wt and _PROTEIN_ lines were almost similar but on mm nacl the _PROTEIN_ lines germinated to a lower extent than wt seeds i.e . after d of wt seeds but only to of the _PROTEIN_ seeds germinated . germination of the latter was also slower because after d almost all of the wt seeds that germinated had germinated whereas hardly any of the _PROTEIN_ seeds had started to germinate . one hundred and twenty five and mm nacl drastically impaired germination of wt seeds and transgenic seeds did not germinate at all . concentrations of to mm mannitol had only minor effect on germination of wt whereas germination in _PROTEIN_ lines showed lower total germination frequencies after d with increasing concentrations . germination was also slower . at concentrations of and mm mannitol wt germination was also critically reduced . germination on the lowest concentration of mv did not result in any difference between wt and _PROTEIN_ seeds . at to mv germination of wt and transgenic seeds were gradually delayed and also much lower after d. wt seeds could however withstand higher concentrations than _PROTEIN_ seeds . four hundred and mv dramatically impaired germination of wt and _PROTEIN_ seeds . in summary the _PROTEIN_ lines were slower and less inclined to germinate when exposed to osmotic and oxidative stress . to investigate the fate of the _PROTEIN_ protein during imbibition with and without stress we determined protein levels of wt and _PROTEIN_ seeds imbibed on and mm mannitol or on water using western blotting . in wt seeds and _PROTEIN_ seeds _PROTEIN_ levels correlate inversely to germination frequency i.e . the level is highest in seeds imbibed on mm mannitol and lowest in seeds germinated on water for d. on water with a germination frequency of near to only traces of _PROTEIN_ protein was seen in the double the amount of total protein and times longer exposure time that in figure a faint _PROTEIN_ protein band could be detected . it should also be noted that compared with wt the _PROTEIN_ level is higher in both _PROTEIN_ lines which have significantly lower germination frequencies than wt on mannitol . to investigate whether the _PROTEIN_ protein level was reflected in the _PROTEIN_ transcript level mrna from seeds imbibed on water and on mm mannitol was isolated and subjected to northern hybridization with an _PROTEIN_ probe . although the _PROTEIN_ transcript is hardly visible in the mrna from seeds germinated on water the _PROTEIN_ transcript level is high in seeds imbibed on mannitol and considerably higher in _PROTEIN_ seeds than in wt consistent with the lower germination frequencies of the _PROTEIN_ seeds .
