previously characterized arabidopsis mutants have trichomes that are smaller less branched and undergo fewer rounds of endoreplication than wild type trichomes . a new mutant called sst has oddly shaped trichomes that over expand during early development undergo more endoreduplication and that have a striking _LOCATION_ morphology . the mutant _LOCATION_ consist of many interconnected lobes however only a single set of polytene like chromosomes reside in the mutant _LOCATION_ . the predicted sst polypeptide has a leu to phe substitution within a region responsible for protein protein interaction . yeast interaction assays comparing _PROTEIN_ with sst proteins show that the mutant protein interaction with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ by and respectively but there is no difference in its interaction with _PROTEIN_ . furthermore _PROTEIN_ has the ability to prevent the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction and the _PROTEIN_ sst interaction is even more sensitive to _PROTEIN_ . analysis of plants _PROTEIN_ functional _METHOD_ tagged versions of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ show that the proteins are localized in trichome _LOCATION_ . these results have been used to model trichome initiation in _METHOD_ of protein interactions and threshold levels of activator complex .
a new trichome mutant with a highly pleiotropic trichome phenotype was found in an _METHOD_ treated col population . trichomes on wild type leaves typically consist of a stalk and three to four branches . the trichomes on the leaves of the mutant varied from nearly normal to lacking a normal stalk and exhibiting multiple abnormal branches to lacking branches . for this reason the mutant was tentatively named shapeshifter . the sst trichomes also varied in their degree of maturation . during the final phase of development wild type trichomes develop papillae on the outer surface of the cell wall . while the normal appearing sst trichomes developed a few papillae most mutant trichomes lacked papillae . in addition to the morphological defects in trichome development sst leaves exhibited fewer trichomes that were abnormally clustered . analysis of leaf trichome and trichome branch number the plants from crosses between sst and col shared two trichome abnormalities with homozygous sst mutants . first there were fewer trichomes per leaf and second the trichomes consistently had more branches than wild type trichomes . neither of the alterations in the phenotype was as extreme as seen in the homozygous mutant . the segregation analysis of the population indicates that the severe sst phenotype was recessive and probably caused by a mutation at a single locus . these findings were further supported by the analysis of selected populations . it was found that all selected plants with wild type trichomes only produced wild type plants sst plants only produced sst whereas the plants with trichomes containing extra branches gave rise to segregating populations . the sst mutation was mapped to a chromosomal region containing the candidate gene _PROTEIN_ . to determine if sst represented a new allele of _PROTEIN_ sst was crossed with the mutant . the plants had a distinct phenotype as shown in fig . . the trichomes on these plants tended to be less branched than wild type trichomes but the branches were much larger in diameter than mutant trichomes . these results suggested that sst is an allele of _PROTEIN_ . to obtain molecular evidence that sst was a new _PROTEIN_ allele the _PROTEIN_ locus in the sst mutant was isolated by pcr and sequenced . the _PROTEIN_ locus of sst contained a single base change of c to t in codon which converts leu to phe . as a final indicator that sst was a new allele of _PROTEIN_ a green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged version of the wild type _PROTEIN_ coding region was moved into sst plants . this gene fusion was placed under the control of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ gene promoter which has previously been shown to drive gene _PROTEIN_ in trichomes . this construct rescued the phenotype resulting from both sst and mutations . these results demonstrated that sst represented a new _PROTEIN_ allele which hereafter will be called sst . the sst trichomes exhibit a dramatic increase in cell expansion during early stages of trichome development . this resulted in most stage two sst trichomes being much larger than wild type trichomes . the increased surface area of early stage mutant trichomes appeared to support a larger number of branch initiation sites . the degree to which the branches expanded varied greatly . while trichome expansion eventually ceased very few sst trichomes developed papillae . in contrast to the excessive expansion seen for sst trichomes trichomes expanded less during early stages . the elemental composition of col and sst trichome cell walls was compared using _PROTEIN_ edax which can determine the major elemental composition of selected surfaces . the papillae on col trichomes contained _PROTEIN_ oxygen magnesium calcium and phosphorus whereas the smooth wall regions between the papillae were lacking phosphorus . for the walls of sst trichomes that contained papillae it was found that both the papillae and intervening regions lacked phosphorus and magnesium . the sst trichomes that lacked papillae also lacked calcium as well as phosphorus and magnesium . these cell walls were similar in composition to the mature guard and pavement cells surrounding the trichomes on wild type leaves which only showed peaks for _PROTEIN_ and oxygen . the dna content of mature col trichomes ranges from to . the analysis of images of dapi stained sst trichome _LOCATION_ indicated that the sst trichomes contain much more dna than wild type or trichomes . interestingly the dapi stained sst mutant _LOCATION_ appeared to be composed of numerous lobes collapsed upon one another . to observe the _LOCATION_ in living plants col and sst plants _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ localized _METHOD_ fusion were used for confocal analysis . this analysis showed that wild type _LOCATION_ were single spheres whereas the sst _LOCATION_ were composed of a series of interconnected lobes . the sst trichome _LOCATION_ defect was further characterized to determine if each _LOCATION_ lobe in sst trichomes contains a distinct set of chromosomes . this question was addressed using the two component lac operator/repressor _METHOD_ _METHOD_ reporter system that has been used to visualize interphase chromatin . fig . shows representative confocal images of col and sst _LOCATION_ from plants that contained integrated lac operator sequences and that _PROTEIN_ the lac i _METHOD_ fusion protein . to compare cells that undergo different degrees of endoreduplication the trichome _LOCATION_ were compared to the _LOCATION_ of guard cells and epidermal pavement cells . all _LOCATION_ exhibited a low level of green _METHOD_ which allowed the outline of the _LOCATION_ to be visualized . the guard cells have been shown to contain dna and a single faint spot corresponding to the binding of lac i _METHOD_ to the integrated operator was seen in most of the guard cell _LOCATION_ of col and sst leaves . epidermal pavement cells typically have a dna content ranging from to and as shown in fig . d these cells typically contained brighter spots . col trichomes contain an average of and as shown in fig . the integrated lac operator was most often visualized in interphase chromatin as a single intense spot although occasionally closely clustered bright spots were seen . shown in fig . is an image of a sst trichome _LOCATION_ with a relatively large focus of _METHOD_ . two lines had trichome _LOCATION_ with two intense spots and these lines probably have two lac op inserts . lines _PROTEIN_ lac i _METHOD_ but lacking the integrated lac op repeat did not have spots . these lines were first generation transformants for the lac op repeat so the copy number of lac op units has not been assessed . this analysis also showed that the morphology of non trichome epidermal cell _LOCATION_ in sst was not affected by the mutation . it was previously noted that _PROTEIN_ is functionally redundant to _PROTEIN_ and it has been shown that _PROTEIN_ plants lack trichomes . to determine if _PROTEIN_ is needed for the sst trichome development an _PROTEIN_ mutant was crossed to sst . the _PROTEIN_ mutant used for this analysis was the previously uncharacterized salk line which contained a t dna insertion in the third exon of _PROTEIN_ . thus to determine if the t dna insertion mutant line behaved in the same matter as previously described _PROTEIN_ mutants the t dna mutant was also crossed to . as previously described for _PROTEIN_ and interactions it was found that plants homozygous for the insertion and were glabrous . in the population of plants derived from the cross between the insertional mutant and sst plants had a wild type phenotype and another closely resembled sst . progeny from five of the sst like lines were analyzed . one of the five populations consisted solely of plants with a reduced number of sst like trichomes . these plants were found to be homozygous for both sst and the t dna insertion . in addition to the reduced number of leaf trichomes it was found that the double mutants lacked stem trichomes . the mutation responsible for sst allele is in a region that encodes a protein domain which mediates interaction with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins . to determine if the mutation affected protein protein interactions the yeast two hybrid system was used to compare the interactions of sst and _PROTEIN_ proteins with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . to study the interactions the coding regions of the _PROTEIN_ and sst were fused to the activation domain of whereas _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were fused to the binding domain of . yeast containing either empty or pbridge vectors in conjunction with any of the corresponding trichome protein fusions did not exhibit significant gal activity whereas yeast containing either sst ad or _PROTEIN_ ad and _PROTEIN_ bd _PROTEIN_ bd or _PROTEIN_ bd exhibited gal activity . however there was a significant difference in activity level between the strains containing either sst ad or _PROTEIN_ ad . yeast isolates containing _PROTEIN_ bd and _PROTEIN_ ad exhibited approximately fourfold higher levels gal activity than isolates containing _PROTEIN_ bd and sst ad . yeast containing _PROTEIN_ bd and _PROTEIN_ ad exhibited approximately a twofold higher level gal activity than isolates containing _PROTEIN_ bd and sst ad . finally it was found that _PROTEIN_ bd interacted equally well with either _PROTEIN_ ad or sst ad . in a previous model it has been posited that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ compete for the same binding site on the _PROTEIN_ protein to form alternate types of complexes . to test this model and to determine if the mutation in sst alters the proposed competitive interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the pbridge system was used to create a competitive yeast interaction assay . in addition to _PROTEIN_ a binding site fusion protein pbridge can also _PROTEIN_ a second protein which is under the control of a methionine repressible promoter and does not contain either a bd or ad domain . to determine if _PROTEIN_ can compete with _PROTEIN_ for a binding site on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was cloned into the free site of the _PROTEIN_ bd construct to create the plasmid _PROTEIN_ bd/try free . in the absence of methionine where _PROTEIN_ free _PROTEIN_ would be at maximum levels it was found that yeast containing _PROTEIN_ ad or sst ad and _PROTEIN_ bd/try free exhibited very little gal activity . as the concentration of methionine was increased which should depress _PROTEIN_ free _PROTEIN_ the levels of gal activity increased . the differences in the levels of gal activity were not due to the presence or absence of methionine as yeast containing either _PROTEIN_ ad or sst ad and _PROTEIN_ bd were able to _PROTEIN_ gal to the same level in the presence or absence of mm methionine . these results are consistent with the model which predicts that free _PROTEIN_ protein should be able to inhibit the interaction between _PROTEIN_ ad and _PROTEIN_ bd . furthermore with the reduction in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interactions in the sst plants it would take less _PROTEIN_ protein to reduce the level of the activation complex . to corroborate the yeast interaction data the cellular location of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins was ascertained . this analysis made use of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion construct that was used to rescue the and sst mutants . in addition _METHOD_ fusions with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were generated . the layer specific promoter from _PROTEIN_ which is upregulated in developing trichomes was used to drive the _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ promoter was used to _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion . both of these constructs were able to rescue their respective mutants . strong mutants typically lack all adaxial leaf surface trichomes . the _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct in the background restored the development of wild type like trichomes . try mutants typically have trichomes that are extra branched and of try trichomes develop next to one another . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct was able to rescue both of these phenotypes . as shown in fig . i all of the fusion proteins can be clearly detected in the trichome _LOCATION_ . the filter set used to collect the images limits the _METHOD_ emission to the green range . at the higher gain and exposure setting on the ccd camera the primarily red chlorophyll _METHOD_ was still detected in the green range . this background autofluoresecence was detected in the mesophyll cells of all samples at the higher gain and exposure settings . in addition a low background of green _METHOD_ was emitted from control col wild type trichome cell walls at the higher settings . importantly col wild type trichome _LOCATION_ lacked detectable _METHOD_ . these results place _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins in the trichome _LOCATION_ where they could interact as observed in the yeast system . to determine if increased _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ could alter the sst phenotype mutant plants were transformed with a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter which drives _PROTEIN_ in trichomes . this construct has the ability to rescue the phenotype of try mutant plants . the phenotype of sst plants containing the _PROTEIN_ gene was modified . firstly it reduced the number of leaf trichomes on these plants . on the third leaf the col plants had trichomes the sst mutant had trichomes and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ sst line had only trichomes . secondly extra _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ greatly reduced the prevalence of clustered trichomes . the percentage of trichome clustering observed on the third leaf was for the sst mutant as compared with for the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ sst line . no trichome clusters were detected in the col plants .
the mutant used in this study was isolated from the weigel activation tagged t dna lines . the try and _PROTEIN_ mutants were identified using the signal website and were derived from salk lines and respectively . was obtained from dr koornneef in a ler background and was backcrossed three times into a col background before being used in these analyses . plants were grown on soil at and constant illumination of . bulk segregation analysis of an population derived from a cross between col sst and ler was used to determine the general chromosomal location of sst . to more finely map the chromosomal location of sst dna samples from sst plants were tested with _PROTEIN_ and sslp marker primer pairs . data from these reactions placed the sst locus between _PROTEIN_ and on chromosome . additional sslp markers were created utilizing information from the insertion/deletion polymorphism collection generated by cereon genomics . indels and were ultimately used to limit the sst locus to either tac clone or clone . because the clone contained the candidate _PROTEIN_ gene sst was tested for allelism to _PROTEIN_ . the mutation causes a c to t transition at codon which results in the loss of an acii site . using forward tcagtacggagccttttccaacagc and reverse ctttaacattccttgtgatggtgcc primers a bp genomic fragment was amplified using the extract n amp pcr system . digesting the samples with acii generated fragments of bp and bp for col compared with a bp fragment for . the sst mutation causes a c to t transition at codon leading to the elimination of a ddei site . using forward gcgaattcgccatggctaccggacaaaacagaac and reverse gcggaagctcgtctggtgac primers a bp fragment was generated by pcr . digesting the samples with ddei generated fragments of bp and bp for col compared with a bp fragment for sst . salk line contains a t dna insert in the third exon of _GENE_ . to distinguish between the insertional mutant and wild loci two sets of primers were used . one set of primers was used to detect the wild type gene and another set of primers was used to detect the t dna insertion . the plant specimens were frozen in liquid nitrogen and processed with an emitech cryo preparation system where the specimens were sputter coated with nm gold and imaged using a cold stage with a hitachi scanning electron microscope . for x ray elemental analysis the

cloning it into the corresponding sites of pegad _PROTEIN_ pro . petry _METHOD_ ctry and _METHOD_ ctry were generated by excising the coding region of _PROTEIN_ from pcr _PROTEIN_ bd as an ecori/bamhi fragment and cloning it into the appropriate sites of pegad _PROTEIN_ pro and pegad _PROTEIN_ pro respectively the binary constructs were introduced into agrobacterium tumefaciens by electroporation . the arabidopsis columbia strains were transformed with agrobacterium by dipping and selected on soil with basta . _METHOD_ flourescence was detected in mature trichomes using a nikon eclipse microscope with a cool cam color ccd camera and imago pro plus version software . mature leaf tissue from columbia wild type and sst was stained with dapi as previously described . the staining was visualized with a nikon diaphot inverted microscope with dic optics and a kodak photo capture system . _PROTEIN_ ad was constructed by cloning an ecori/bamhi fragment containing the _PROTEIN_ coding region from into the ecori and bglii sites of . psst ad was generated by swapping a bp bamhi/bglii fragment from pcr sst n with the corresponding fragment from _PROTEIN_ ad . the _PROTEIN_ coding region from the sst mutant was generated by pcr amplifying a kp fragment from sst cdna using the primers forward gcgaattcgccatggctaccggacaaaacagaac and reverse cggatcaagaacgttgtcgatgtg . the fragment was cloned into _PROTEIN_ and the presence of only the sst specific c to t change at positon was confirmed by dna sequencing . the coding regions for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ used to make binding domain fusions originated from _PROTEIN_ b and pcr _PROTEIN_ bd . both _PROTEIN_ b and were gifts from dr lloyd whereas pcr _PROTEIN_ bd was a pcr generated _PROTEIN_ coding region from columbia cdna that was cloned into _PROTEIN_ and verified by dna sequencing . the _PROTEIN_ bd bd and ptry bd were generated by cloning a kb ecori/psti fragment kb ecori/sali fragment and kb ecori/bamhi fragment respectively into the corresponding sites of pbridge . the construct used for the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ competition assay _PROTEIN_ bd/try free was generated by cloning a kb
