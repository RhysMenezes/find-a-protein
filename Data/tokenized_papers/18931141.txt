_LOCATION_ play key roles in energy metabolism cell signaling and plant development . a better understanding of these important functions will be achieved with a more complete definition of the _LOCATION_ proteome . the isolation of _LOCATION_ and their separation from mitochondria and other major _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ have been significant _PROTEIN_ in the arabidopsis model system . in this study we present new data on the arabidopsis _LOCATION_ proteome obtained using two new technical advances that have not previously been applied to studies of plant _LOCATION_ . first we followed density gradient centrifugation with free flow electrophoresis to improve the separation of _LOCATION_ from mitochondria . second we used quantitative proteomics to identify proteins enriched in the _LOCATION_ fractions relative to mitochondrial fractions . we provide evidence for peroxisomal localization of proteins of which have not previously been identified in other analyses of arabidopsis _LOCATION_ . chimeric green _METHOD_ protein constructs of proteins have been used to confirm their localization in _LOCATION_ or to identify _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ contaminants . the distribution of many of these peroxisomal proteins between soluble _LOCATION_ associated and integral _LOCATION_ locations has also been determined . this core peroxisomal proteome from nonphotosynthetic cultured cells contains a proportion of proteins that can not be predicted to be peroxisomal due to the lack of recognizable peroxisomal targeting sequence _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ signals . proteins identified are likely to be components in _LOCATION_ biogenesis oxidation for fatty acid degradation and hormone biosynthesis photorespiration and metabolite transport . a considerable number of the proteins found in _LOCATION_ have no known function and potential roles of these proteins in peroxisomal metabolism are discussed . this is aided by a metabolic network analysis that reveals a tight integration of functions and highlights specific metabolite nodes that most probably represent entry and exit metabolites that could require transport across the peroxisomal _LOCATION_ .
an organellar fraction consisting _PROTEIN_ of mitochondria and _LOCATION_ was obtained from disrupted arabidopsis protoplasts using differential centrifugation and density gradient purification . ffe was then employed to separate _LOCATION_ from the bulk of mitochondrial material . we have demonstrated previously that ffe is able to increase the purity of mitochondrial isolates by separating them from _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ according to differences in the surface charge of each organelle yielding mitochondria that have seven times less contamination . under the conditions applied mitochondria _LOCATION_ and other cellular material migrated close together in ffe but with different degrees of overlap . the electrophoretic mobility of _LOCATION_ was lower than that of mitochondria at v . in order to optimize ffe for the isolation of arabidopsis _LOCATION_ a higher voltage was applied to increase the separation between the mitochondrial and peroxisomal fraction peaks . the distribution of mitochondria and _LOCATION_ was monitored using immunodetection of marker proteins . at v the mitochondrial fraction marker protein _PROTEIN_ peaked in fraction while the peroxisomal marker _PROTEIN_ peaked in fraction but the distributions were overlapping . by expanding the distributions at v both mitochondrial and peroxisomal signals moved further toward anodic fractions revealing two mitochondrial subpopulations with different electrophoretic mobilities peaking between fractions to and fractions to . meanwhile the peak fractions enriched in _LOCATION_ were nearly fractions away in fractions to and devoid of visible mitochondrial contamination . while this higher voltage did tend to lead to greater losses of _PROTEIN_ signal into the anodic mitochondrial fractions than was apparent at v the displacement of the bulk of mitochondria from _LOCATION_ was optimal for the preparation of _LOCATION_ . using this approach peroxisomal and mitochondrial samples with only minimal amounts of contamination were obtained by selecting the central three fractions of each distribution at v to ensure the best compromise between yield and purity . in order to produce a highly enriched mitochondrial sample for comparative functional assays against the peroxisomal fraction the mitochondria were then subjected to another round of ffe at v to separate them from contaminating _LOCATION_ which migrated into the left border of the separation chamber and therefore were not resolved well from the mitochondria at v . measurement of catalase activity as a marker for _LOCATION_ gave an oxygen production rate of in pre ffe organelle pellets which was approximately of total cellular extract activity . total catalase activity was approximately in the ffe purified _LOCATION_ fraction which is approximately of the activity in pre ffe organelle pellets and approximately of total cellular extract activity . this degree of recovery is similar to that shown in preparations of leaf _LOCATION_ from arabidopsis when following hydroxypyruvate reductase activity . to quantify the difference between mitochondrial and _LOCATION_ fractions catalase and succinate dehydrogenase activities were measured as marker enzymes . the specific activity of catalase was much higher in the putative peroxisomal fraction than in the pre ffe or mitochondrial sample indicating clear enrichment of _LOCATION_ in this fraction . at the same time the specific activity of succinate dehydrogenase in the putative peroxisomal fraction was only approximately of that measured in the mitochondrial sample . _METHOD_ brilliant blue stained _PROTEIN_ gel lanes of a pre ffe organellar sample compared with post ffe samples of pooled _LOCATION_ and mitochondria fractions are shown in figure . while the banding pattern of the pre ffe sample was very similar to that of the mitochondrial fraction the putative _LOCATION_ displayed a distinct pattern with very little resemblance to the other two samples . therefore we concluded that the pre ffe fraction contained mostly mitochondria and only a limited proportion of other organelles whereas the putative peroxisomal fraction was largely free of mitochondrial proteins . abundant protein bands present in the mitochondrial and peroxisomal samples were excised from one dimensional gels for identification by _METHOD_ . the primary protein identification for each spot is summarized in supplemental table supporting these as purified mitochondrial and peroxisomal fractions derived from ffe . subsequent quantitative proteomic analysis allowed the quantification of a series of classical peroxisomal and mitochondrial markers between the two fractions . this shows an average ratio of for mitochondrial proteins in the peroxisomal compared with the mitochondrial samples and approximately fold enrichment for peroxisomal proteins in the peroxisomal compared with mitochondrial samples . in general agreement the succinate dehydrogenase specific activity in the _LOCATION_ was one twelfth of that in the mitochondrial sample and the catalase specific activity was approximately fold higher in the _LOCATION_ sample . based on these specific activity measurements and protein ratios we estimated the approximate _LOCATION_ purity as to . this is based on mitochondria being the largest contaminant in the _LOCATION_ preparations and this mitochondrial contamination being to . also the catalase specific activity in the mitochondrial fraction is only of that in the _LOCATION_ fraction so the at least approximately fold increase in catalase and other _LOCATION_ markers indicates that approximately of the protein in the _LOCATION_ fraction should be of peroxisomal origin . an in depth analysis of the proteins in each fraction was obtained by two dimensional differential in gel electrophoresis isoelectric focusing _PROTEIN_ using three independent _LOCATION_ and mitochondria preparations . figure shows the false colored spot intensity maps for both organelle fractions as well as a superimposition of the two spot maps for one of the three gel sets . the amount of overlap between the two samples is low and two clearly distinct patterns can be observed . while the mitochondrial pattern is focused around pi values between and and resembles that of a previously published study using the same material the distribution of the peroxisomal pattern is heavily skewed toward the basic side of the pi spectrum . this shift to basic pi can also be observed on gels of leaf _LOCATION_ proteins . many _LOCATION_ protein spots of high abundance have very high pi values and a considerable number did not even reach their pi on the ph to nonlinear immobilized ph gradient strips but migrated right to the cathode . the basic nature of many _LOCATION_ proteins may be related to the typically alkaline nature of the _LOCATION_ lumen . quantification of mitochondrial and peroxisomal spot intensities from all three gel sets was performed using the decyder software package . in total matched spots were found consistently across the three sets . spots with p and an average ratio of or greater _LOCATION_ were designated as mitochondrial and those with an average ratio of or greater _LOCATION_ were designated as peroxisomal . on average the _LOCATION_ mitochondria ratio was approximately for selected putative peroxisomal protein spots while the average mitochondria _LOCATION_ ratio was approximately for selected putative mitochondrial protein spots . spots from a preparative gel were matched with those on the dige gels . prominent peroxisomal and mitochondrial spots matched to the dige gels were excised for tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ identification . in total unique proteins were identified from this gel . as a complement to the gel based approaches reverse phase hplc separation coupled with _METHOD_ was used to gain additional depth in the whole _LOCATION_ proteome . four min intelligent data dependent acquisition runs of the same sample were conducted in series with peptides identified in each run subsequently excluded from _METHOD_ acquisition in the next run . this analysis was performed on the same peroxisomal sample used for the gels containing to mitochondria and also on a second sample containing twice the amount of mitochondrial contamination as deduced from the respiratory assays . in cases in which a protein was identified in both samples the comparison of the empai values and the difference in a protein 's mowse score between the samples was taken as a semiquantitative indicator for localization of a protein . proteins with a higher empai value or a higher mowse score in the high purity sample are putative peroxisomal proteins and those that produced higher values in the low purity sample are putative contaminants . in cases in which a protein was identified in only the high purity sample this has been considered to be an indication of a higher abundance of the protein in that sample . a total of proteins were identified in the high purity sample and in the low purity sample with an overlap of between both fractions . dige and the _METHOD_ derived quantitative data form an important part of our final assessment of the peroxisomal proteome . sequence information for proteins identified by only a single but significant peptide is given in supplemental data set . three suborganellar fractions were prepared from whole _LOCATION_ by repeated freeze/thaw cycles followed by centrifugation in order to separate soluble and _LOCATION_ proteins . isolation of integral _LOCATION_ proteins was achieved by sodium bicarbonate stripping of an aliquot of the _LOCATION_ proteins . a total of of protein from the soluble and complete _LOCATION_ fractions was separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ whereas only could be loaded from the integral _LOCATION_ fraction due to the limited amount of material available . the gel reveals distinct differences in the protein banding patterns between the peroxisomal subfractions . based on the protein quantitation we estimate that the integral proteins account for about of the whole _LOCATION_ fraction protein content . spots from the bands indicated in figure were excised digested and analyzed by liquid chromatography _METHOD_ . from gel bands a total of unique proteins were identified using this approach . double _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ separation of of the _LOCATION_ fraction and of the integral _LOCATION_ fraction was also performed . the dsds gel system has an increased resolution compared with conventional _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ because proteins are separated not only by size but also to a limited extent by their hydrophobicity . therefore it is well suited for the separation of _LOCATION_ proteins . a set of spots from both gels were cut out and the identities of proteins were derived from tandem _METHOD_ analysis . unfortunately a dige approach was not feasible for quantification of the _LOCATION_ proteins in these two approaches . this is due to the limited resolution inherent to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gels compared with ief/sds _PROTEIN_ which often leads to the identification of more than one protein in a band . therefore even if the quantitative analysis of a dige gel could indicate a difference in protein abundance it would be impossible to determine the protein responsible for the change . to complement the and _PROTEIN_ gels a _PROTEIN_ stripped _LOCATION_ sample of the high purity peroxisomal fraction was also analyzed by idda _METHOD_ for the detection of further integral _LOCATION_ proteins . this analysis resulted in the identification of proteins . we also used a phosphopeptide enrichment strategy from organelle peptide preparations to identify phosphopeptides from _LOCATION_ proteins the one significant match was a ser phosphopeptide for one of the _LOCATION_ proteins _PROTEIN_ at ser . several hundred unique proteins were identified in the analyses noted above . while the quantitative proteomics data provided evidence to validate or invalidate peroxisomal location in many cases a selection of proteins for which this analysis was not clear was further verified in vivo on the basis of the transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ fusion proteins . for this purpose proteins carrying a _METHOD_ insertion to amino acids from their c terminus to allow targeting by n and c terminal sequences and the influence of the mature protein sequence on targeting were compared with red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fused to the c terminal amino acids of the _PROTEIN_ containing pumpkin malate synthase . four proteins were used as controls . these were found by our _METHOD_ analysis and had each previously been documented to be in leaf _LOCATION_ by _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . as our _METHOD_ data were completely convergent with these localizations a range of additional proteins were selected for analysis . this list does not include all of the proteins with ambiguous localization data rather it merely focuses on those for which clarification in our view would be most beneficial . nonredundant list of proteins found in _LOCATION_ after removal of contaminants based on quantification the identities of proteins were determined by _METHOD_ the predicted molecular _METHOD_ of the match is shown along with the best mowse score number of peptides and sequence coverage and the number of times this identification was made across the series of experiments performed . localization of proteins within _LOCATION_ can be deduced from subfractionation of organelles _LOCATION_ . quantitative assessments presented in detail in supplemental tables and are presented in the dige column _LOCATION_ and the _METHOD_ high versus low column . similarly the largest empai score based on the number of peptides matched in the high purity versus low purity samples is indicated by high or low in the empai column and independent _METHOD_ localization data were used to designate location in the _METHOD_ column . further columns indicate the presence of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ sequences predicted number of transmembrane domains _METHOD_ previous identifications of each protein in published _LOCATION_ proteomes and the new proteins unique to this analysis . asterisks indicate where a single peptide with a score above but approaching the threshold was used for identification spectra and detailed interpretation are provided in supplemental data set . for four of these proteins the _METHOD_ localization confirmed peroxisomal location and no previous _METHOD_ data have been reported to our knowledge . three of them have recognizable _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ sequences while _GENE_ lacks a recognizable _PROTEIN_ and appears to be a six transmembrane domain carrier family protein . accordingly the _METHOD_ of the _GENE_ _METHOD_ construct appears _PROTEIN_ like surrounding the _PROTEIN_ targeted _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . five targets had been previously reported to localize _METHOD_ to other cell compartments _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . however these earlier reports had used terminal _METHOD_ fusions which frequently localize differentially depending on the terminus to which _METHOD_ is fused . for example _GENE_ is localized solely to the _LOCATION_ when the whole protein is fused to the c terminus of enhanced yellow _METHOD_ protein but is found to be present in _LOCATION_ by internal _METHOD_ fusion of the whole protein . the other reported locations were confirmed except for _GENE_ which did not allow for a confident positive assignment of location based on the internal fusion . a set of other proteins analyzed by internal _METHOD_ fusion to supplement quantitative proteomic data could not be assigned to _LOCATION_ by _METHOD_ and are most likely mitochondrial _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ contaminants . within our list of identified proteins appeared to be major _LOCATION_ proteins . these proteins were considered to be of special interest as connections between the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ in relation to peroxisomal protein import have been reported previously . one of the proteins detected was calreticulin . the distribution of calreticulin across the v separations used for peroxisomal purification reveals enrichment of the antibody signal in the same lanes as the _LOCATION_ indicating either the comigration of _LOCATION_ components with _LOCATION_ during ffe or the presence of calreticulin in these organelles . analysis of the dige ief/sds _PROTEIN_ data revealed that many of the _LOCATION_ proteins reported in table ii including three _METHOD_ of calreticulin were enriched in the _LOCATION_ sample relative to the mitochondrial sample consistent with the enrichment in peroxisomal fractions seen with the calreticulin antibodies . nonredundant list of probable _LOCATION_ proteins found in peroxisomal samples but removed on the basis of our _METHOD_ data and previous proteomics reports on _LOCATION_ samples the identities of proteins were determined by _METHOD_ the predicted molecular _METHOD_ of the match is shown along with the best mowse score the number of peptides and sequence coverage and the number of times this identification was made across the series of experiments performed . localization of proteins within _LOCATION_ can be deduced from subfractionation of organelles _LOCATION_ . quantitative assessments presented in detail in supplemental tables and are presented in the dige column _LOCATION_ and the _METHOD_ high versus low column . new _METHOD_ localization data are shown in our _METHOD_ . literature reports of these proteins in subcellular locations based on _METHOD_ data _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ data or in protein name annotations are shown in the last three columns these data were sourced from the _PROTEIN_ database . eleven of the proteins suspected to be _LOCATION_ proteins were analyzed by internal _METHOD_ fusions . besides their obvious _LOCATION_ location none of them could be positively localized to _LOCATION_ . however it became apparent from the analysis of the _METHOD_ images that some sort of interaction between the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ might exist . frequently _LOCATION_ appear to be heavily embedded in the _LOCATION_ with the _METHOD_ intensity peaking at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ border _PROTEIN_ but so far it is unclear whether this is a result of a higher _LOCATION_ density in this area or a higher concentration of the fusion protein . to ensure maximum depth in protein analysis multiple strategies employing gel and nongel separation of proteins and peptides were used in our analysis . quantitative or semiquantitative measurement of the abundance of proteins was obtained using dige _METHOD_ measurements from highly purified _LOCATION_ versus purified mitochondrial samples and the ratio of mowse scores or empai in the nongel lc _METHOD_ experiments of high purity peroxisomal versus low purity peroxisomal samples . these provided data to discriminate peroxisomal proteins from potential contaminants . altogether unique proteins were identified in the course of this study . all of them were assessed by a series of _PROTEIN_ to define the final proteome set . these include the quantitative data generated in this study our and other _METHOD_ data as well as previous reports of subcellular localization from other proteome studies . additionally all proteins identified from gels and the liquid phase analysis were examined for the presence or absence of known _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ sequences according to the araperox database . in light of these data we have classified of these proteins as of peroxisomal origin and as _LOCATION_ proteins that copurify with _LOCATION_ . subfractionation of the organelles to soluble peripheral _LOCATION_ and integral _LOCATION_ fractions provided suborganelle location information . hydrophobic proteins are notoriously underrepresented in proteome studies using ief _PROTEIN_ approaches . to determine our success rate in the identification of hydrophobic proteins we used the _PROTEIN_ database to predict transmembrane domains in the set of peroxisomal proteins proteins were predicted to have one or two transmembrane domains two proteins most probably had three to four transmembrane domains and four proteins had more than four transmembrane domains . the latter group _PROTEIN_ consisted of the proteins listed as transporters or integral _LOCATION_ proteins in table i . in order to test if our proteins form an integrated set of functions and to predict if many peroxisomal enzymes are missing from our list we created a metabolic network using data from the aracyc database and visualized it with the cytoscape software package . this was based on the enzyme commission number of all identified proteins as annotated in aracyc which links arabidopsis genome initiative _PROTEIN_ numbers with ec reactions . a total of of the proteins in our _LOCATION_ set from table i were assigned ec numbers making a nonredundant set of enzyme nodes and metabolites . focusing on the metabolites that represent the substrates reactants and products of the network enables us to see points of contact between the different functional categories of proteins and also to predict the need for transporters in the peroxisomal _LOCATION_ by analysis of the metabolite end points of the network . in the network colored nodes represent enzymes in different functional categories metabolites are shown as small gray circles while the reaction is shown as connecting lines between the enzymes and metabolite nodes . the result is a structure derived from our proteome discovery strategy that appears as a well connected single metabolic entity showing that the different metabolic pathways within this _LOCATION_ proteome are interlinked and that there are no large gaps created by lack of identification of critical enzymes in a sequence . about one third of the metabolites do not represent starting or end points of a pathway but are considered to be intermediates of _LOCATION_ metabolism by this network . the terminal metabolite nodes of the network are potential substrates to be transported in or out across the peroxisomal _LOCATION_ via transporters or pores . many of these metabolites have been reported to be transported to diffuse freely across peroxisomal _LOCATION_ or to be incapable of crossing the peroxisomal _LOCATION_ and these are highlighted in figure . the network shows key features of established _LOCATION_ biochemistry . it shows citrate synthase and malate dehydrogenase as key points of contact between oxidation and organic acid/amino acid metabolism through coa/acetyl coa and nad/nadh pools . it also shows that antioxidant defense enzymes operate to detoxify hydrogen peroxide produced by a series of oxidases . the metabolites oxygen hydrogen peroxide water and coa are the most heavily connected nodes but removal of these currency metabolites does not break the highly interconnected structure of this metabolic network .
an arabidopsis suspension cell culture has been _PROTEIN_ and subcultured as stated elsewhere . briefly ml of a d old cell culture grown in the light was transferred into ml of fresh medium . starting material for the _LOCATION_ preparation was grown in the dark for d whereas material used for the _PROTEIN_ of the culture was incubated in the light for the same period of time . the preparation of the organelles was based on citation with some modifications . approximately g of cells was used for each preparation . after enzymatic digestion of the cell wall the resulting protoplasts were disrupted by four strokes in a potter elvehjem homogenizer . the homogenization medium contained bovine serum albumin and edta as general protease inhibitors in addition complete protease inhibitor cocktail was used according to the manufacturer 's instructions to inhibit ser cys and metalloproteases . the homogenate was centrifuged at for min to remove cell debris . the supernatant was spun at for min to concentrate the organelles . however in order to avoid pelleting of the organelles the supernatant of the low speed spin was layered on top of ml of a percoll cushion . the organelle containing interphase was taken and diluted with wash buffer and loaded onto discontinuous percoll density gradients consisting of ml of percoll and ml of percoll in wash buffer . after centrifugation the mitochondrial/peroxisomal band was found between the and the percoll phases . this band was extracted and the percoll was removed by three repeated washes in ffe separation buffer . the first two washes were performed using a suc cushion at the bottom of the tubes again to prevent pelleting of the organelles . the third wash was performed without any cushion and the organelles were pelleted . after resuspension in a small volume of ffe separation buffer the organelle suspension was slowly homogenized in a potter elvehjem homogenizer in preparation for ffe . ffe buffer composition and conditions were similar to those described previously with the exception of the use of either v or v in experiments as indicated . using the higher voltage mitochondria and _LOCATION_ were deflected to such an extent that the _LOCATION_ were running into the anode stabilization medium whereas the mitochondria just stayed within the borders of the separation medium . although a certain amount of mixing between those two organelles occurred the distance between the mitochondria and the _LOCATION_ increased which led to a higher level of purity of the peroxisomal fraction . after visual inspection of the well plate mitochondrial fractions _LOCATION_ and peroxisomal fractions were pooled separately . the mitochondria were then subjected to a second round of ffe at v in order to obtain purer material for the subsequent measurements . catalase activity was measured using a clark type oxygen electrode as outlined previously . succinate dehydrogenase measurements were performed using a clark type oxygen electrode in the presence of mm succinate nmol of adp and nmol of _PROTEIN_ . fifty _METHOD_ of protein was used for each assay . these techniques were performed according to citation . for the preparative gels of protein was used . primary antibodies to calreticulin _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were visualized with horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibodies and chemiluminescent detection of the signal . aliquots of _LOCATION_ and integral _LOCATION_ proteins extracted from _LOCATION_ samples were separated according to citation on tricine _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ containing m urea . after the migration gel strips corresponding to each sample were cut and incubated in acidic solution . the strips were then loaded on top of a tricine _PROTEIN_ polyacrylamide gel . the gap between the strip and the gel was filled with a acrylamide mixture . after electrophoresis the gels were stained with colloidal _METHOD_ brilliant blue . the procedure essentially follows the method outlined by citation . a mg organellar protein pellet was solubilized in of m urea mm edta and mm tris hcl ph . the sample was reduced with mm dtt for h at room temperature followed by alkylation of thiols with mm iodoacetamide for h at room temperature . the solution was diluted to approximately m urea with mm tris hcl ph used to hydrate of trypsin and incubated at overnight . peptides were desalted on bio select reverse phase extraction columns and dried in a vacuum concentrator . peptides were reconstituted in of solution containing acetonitrile trifluoroacetic acid and mg dihydroxybenzoic acid . this solution was added to mg of titanosphere tio equilibrated with acetonitrile tfa and mg dihydroxybenzoic acid . the slurry was rotated for min at room temperature in a mobicol spin column then washed twice with the acetonitrile tfa and mg dihydroxybenzoic acid solution twice with acetonitrile and tfa and twice with a tfa solution . phosphopeptides were eluted from the titanosphere chromatographic material using a freshly prepared m solution . eluted phosphopeptides were dried in a vacuum desiccator and resuspended in acetonitrile and formic acid prior to analysis . phosphopeptides were identified in peptide mixture analysis by q tof lc _METHOD_ as outlined below . colloidal _METHOD_ brilliant blue stained protein spots where cut from gels and destained twice in mm with acetonitrile . samples were dried at before being rehydrated with of digestion solution and incubated overnight at . peptides produced from trypsination were twice extracted from gel plugs using of acetonitrile . the supernatant was then collected and plugs were washed twice with of acetonitrile and tfa and combined with the initial supernatant . the pooled extracts were dried by vacuum centrifugation and stored at before being analyzed by _METHOD_ using an agilent _PROTEIN_ ultra iontrap _METHOD_ spectrometer . the _METHOD_ spectrometer was fitted with an electrospray ionization source equipped with a low flow nebulizer in positive mode and controlled by _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ trap control software version . peptides were eluted from a self packed microsorb reverse phase column using an agilent technologies series capillary liquid chromatography system at using a min acetonitrile gradient in formic acid at a regulated temperature of . the method used for initial ion detection utilized a _METHOD_ range of to _METHOD_ to charge ratio with scan mode set to standard ion charge control conditions set at and three averages taken per scan . smart mode parameter settings were employed using a target of m/z a compound stability _PROTEIN_ of a trap drive level of and optimize set to normal . ions were selected for _METHOD_ after reaching an intensity of cps and two precursor ions were selected from the initial _METHOD_ scan . _METHOD_ conditions employed smartfrag for ion fragmentation a scan range of to m/z using an average of three scans the exclusion of singly charged ions option and ion charge control conditions set to in ultra scan mode . resulting _METHOD_ spectra were exported from the dataanalysis for _METHOD_ trap version software package using default parameters and compound maxima for _METHOD_ and compound export . the .mgf files generated were then analyzed as outlined below . protein samples were also analyzed with a nongel approach using peptide mixture lc _METHOD_ analysis . the protein extracts were digested overnight at with trypsin and insoluble components were removed by centrifugation at for min . the supernatant was then dried by vacuum centrifugation and stored at before being analyzed by _METHOD_ . samples were analyzed on an agilent q tof _METHOD_ spectrometer with an hplc _PROTEIN_ cube source . the _PROTEIN_ consisted of a nl enrichment column and a mm separation column driven by the agilent technologies series nano/capillary liquid chromatography system . both _METHOD_ were controlled by _METHOD_ workstation data acquisition for q tof . peptides were resuspended in acetonitrile and formic acid and loaded onto the trapping column at in acetonitrile and formic acid with the _PROTEIN_ switched to enrichment and using the capillary pump . after the sample volume passed through the enrichment column five times the _PROTEIN_ was then switched to separation and peptides were eluted from the enrichment column and run through the separation column during a h gradient directly into the _METHOD_ spectrometer . the _METHOD_ spectrometer was run in positive ion mode and _METHOD_ scans were run over a range of m/z to and at four spectra per second . precursor ions were selected for auto _METHOD_ at an absolute threshold of and a relative threshold of with a maximum of three precursors per cycle and active exclusion set at two spectra and released after min . precursor charge state selection and preference were set to and then and precursors were selected by charge and then abundance . resulting _METHOD_ spectra were opened in _METHOD_ workstation qualitative analysis and _METHOD_ compounds were detected by find auto _METHOD_ using default settings . the resulting compounds were then exported as mzdata.xml files and searched as outlined below . output files were analyzed against an in house arabidopsis database comprising _PROTEIN_ from the arabidopsis information resource and the mitochondrial and _LOCATION_ protein sets . this sequence database contained a total of protein sequences . searches from ion trap data were conducted using the mascot search engine version _PROTEIN_ utilizing _LOCATION_ tolerances of d for _METHOD_ and d for _METHOD_ max missed cleavages set to the oxidation and _PROTEIN_ variable modifications and the instrument set to esi trap and peptide charge set at and . results were filtered using standard scoring maximum number of hits set to significance threshold at p < and ion score cutoff at . searches from q tof data were conducted using the mascot search engine version _PROTEIN_ utilizing _LOCATION_ tolerances of ppm for _METHOD_ and d for _METHOD_ max missed cleavages set to the oxidation and _PROTEIN_ variable modifications and the instrument set to esi q tof and peptide charge set at and . results were filtered using mudpit scoring maximum number of hits set to significance threshold at p < and ion score cutoff at . protein matches were only claimed if at least two distinct peptides were detected per protein resulting in mowse scores typically higher than . following an initial run as outlined above in peptide mixture analysis the resulting mzdata.xml files were searched as outlined in data analysis. the resulting matches were then filtered by an ion score setting of and all peptides with ion scores of or greater were exported from mascot along with their respective peptide charge into a .csv file . this file was then used to construct an exclusion list based on peptide and charge . isolation width was set to medium approximately m/z precursor type was set to exclude retention time was set to and was set to ppm . this table was then loaded into the _METHOD_ workstation data acquisition for q tof software and then the next sample was run . following the second run the new list of excluded peptides was added to the previous list and the new list was loaded for the third run . this process was repeated for the fourth run also . following acquisition of data from all four runs the resulting mzdata.xml files were concatenated into a single mzdata.xml file using mzdatacombinator version _METHOD_ . the resulting files were then used to search an in house arabidopsis database as outlined above . _METHOD_ fusions were constructed according to a modification of the _METHOD_ tagging of full length proteins _PROTEIN_ method . _PROTEIN_ introduces _METHOD_ into genomic clones in a stretch of hydrophilic amino acids in a position corresponding to approximately amino acids from the c terminus . in its original context _PROTEIN_ is claimed to represent a good first pass for spatial and temporal localization of proteins for which no other information is available and is suggested to be a good alternative to constructing both n and c terminal fusions . citation present proof of principle for marker proteins targeted to numerous organelles including _METHOD_ which was directed to _LOCATION_ . a number of studies have specifically used _PROTEIN_ to preserve the n terminal targeting signal and the c terminal retention motifs . we _PROTEIN_ the method for high throughput analysis of full length proteins via a transient _PROTEIN_ assay . for many of the proteins examined here there were either no clear predicted targeting signals or potentially conflicting n and c terminal signals . thus _METHOD_ was still inserted to amino acids from the c terminus but this was done using coding sequence alone and driven by the promoter for transient _PROTEIN_ in onion cell epidermal peel and arabidopsis cell culture . the position of amino acids from the c terminus largely avoids structural and functional protein domains and preserves both n and c terminal targeting sequences in full length proteins . the aim of this approach was to avoid masking potential n or c terminal targeting signals with _METHOD_ and to reduce the chance that blocking the biologically relevant signal might allow cryptic physiologically meaningless signals to take precedence . _METHOD_ was amplified including _PROTEIN_ as described . the portion of the gene corresponding to the n terminus of the protein was amplified using appropriate primers . templates for amplification were cloned cdnas if available or total cdna . oligonucleotides and corresponding to the c terminal to amino acids plus the stop codon of the protein were synthesized to constitute a template for direct inclusion in a second round of pcr . primers and included _PROTEIN_ that partially overlapped with attb gateway cloning sequences while primers and had _PROTEIN_ that overlapped with those bounding the _METHOD_ fragment the _PROTEIN_ were as described by citation . three template pcr thus included three overlapping templates _METHOD_ . three template pcr products were cloned into gateway vector and sequenced to check pcr accuracy . the _METHOD_ constructs were then introduced into a pgreen vector modified for gateway . we used containing cauliflower mosaic virus promoter and cauliflower mosaic virus terminator with the gateway a cassette inserted between them in the smai site of the pgreen multiple cloning site . for colocalization studies _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was used as a peroxisomal marker . plasmids were precipitated onto gold particles and biolistically transformed into arabidopsis cultured cells or onion epidermal peel as described by citation . _METHOD_ images were obtained using an olympus _METHOD_ microscope with hq _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ filters and cellr software . alternatively a leica tcs _PROTEIN_ multiphoton confocal microscope was used with laser excitation of _METHOD_ at nm and _METHOD_ at nm . emission collection was in the ranges of to nm and to nm respectively . confocal images were captured using leica confocal software . aracyc is a database of biochemical pathways for arabidopsis . over of the pathways in the current release of aracyc have been manually curated with experimental data . proteins identified in this study were associated with biochemical reactions in aracyc release by downloading from the plant metabolic network _PROTEIN_ server the tab delimited text files and for each _PROTEIN_ code in table i pathway names ec numbers and enzyme names that have been associated by aracyc with that _PROTEIN_ code were extracted from the aracyc_dump file . biochemical reactions and their compounds were extracted from the lines in the aracyc_compounds file which contained both the pathway name and the ec number associated with each _PROTEIN_ code . a total of of the _PROTEIN_ numbers in our _LOCATION_ set shown in table i were assigned ec numbers in this manner making a nonredundant set of enzyme nodes and metabolites . it should be noted that multiple distinct reactions corresponding to differing substrates can be assigned to a single ec number in aracyc . these often occur when an ec number occurs in the context of separate biochemical pathways . therefore we extracted only those biochemical reactions for which both the ec number and the pathway name matched those associated with an _PROTEIN_ code to avoid incorporating metabolites that may only be involved in pathways outside of the _LOCATION_ . after the recovery of these data the set of unique ec numbers and biochemical reactions was parsed to generate a simple interaction format file to represent a metabolic network . the simple interaction format file and other data such as _PROTEIN_ codes associated with ec numbers enzyme names and node types were inputted into the cytoscape software for network visualization and analysis . network images were exported from cytoscape as .svg files imported into adobe illustrator and modified visually for presentation purposes . the following materials are available in the online version of this article . supplemental figure . ief/sds
