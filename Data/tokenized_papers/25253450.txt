the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ family transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is _LOCATION_ localized and positively regulates aba and stress responses . abscisic acid is a major plant hormone that controls the _PROTEIN_ of hundreds genes involved in various aspects of plant growth and development such as seed development germination seedling growth and abiotic stress response . several cis elements mediating the aba regulated gene _PROTEIN_ have been reported and one of the regulatory elements is coupling element . we previously isolated a group of _PROTEIN_ family proteins that bind but their functions are mostly unknown . in this study we demonstrate that one of the binding _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is involved in aba response . to investigate the _PROTEIN_ function we generated its overexpression lines by _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ coding region under the control of camv promoter and analyzed their phenotypes . we found that the _PROTEIN_ ox lines were hypersensitive to aba at the germination stage . the aba hypersensitivity was also observed in our root elongation assay of seedlings . furthermore the transgenic lines were hypersensitive to high salinity and high osmolarity at the seedling establishment stage and the transgenic seedlings were drought tolerant . we also determined the tissue specific _PROTEIN_ pattern and the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ . our results indicate that it is highly _PROTEIN_ in roots and embryos and _LOCATION_ localized . collectively our data suggest that _PROTEIN_ is a positive regulator of aba response .
our previous study showed that _PROTEIN_ is inducible by high salinity although it is not induced by aba and other abiotic stresses . to further investigate its tissue specific _PROTEIN_ pattern we determined its transcript levels in various tissues by real time rt pcr . figure shows that its _PROTEIN_ was higher in siliques and roots . weaker _PROTEIN_ was observed in leaves but _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was not detected in flowers . to investigate the tissue specific _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in detail we prepared transgenic pants harboring an _PROTEIN_ promoter gus construct and examined the _PROTEIN_ promoter activity by histochemical gus staining . weak gus activity was observed in the embryo especially in the axis and its tip region . during germination the gus activity in the axis gradually increased . in seedlings relatively strong gus activity was detected in the primary root in the growing region and in the _PROTEIN_ root primordia and _PROTEIN_ root tips . occasionally gus activity was observed in leaves but no gus activity was detected in the floral organs . because the _PROTEIN_ transcript level is salt inducible we examined whether the gus activity was induced by high salt . however we did not observe salt dependent changes in gus activity . the result implies that _PROTEIN_ transcript level may be post transcriptionally regulated . to gain further clue to the function of _PROTEIN_ we determined its subcellular localization . a construct containing the _PROTEIN_ coding region fused to _METHOD_ was prepared and it was introduced into tobacco leaves by agroinfiltration . the subcellular localization was then determined by observing _METHOD_ signal under _METHOD_ microscope . as shown in fig . the _METHOD_ signal was detected _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ is _LOCATION_ localized . to assess the in planta function of _PROTEIN_ in aba response we prepared _PROTEIN_ ox lines in which the _PROTEIN_ coding region is _PROTEIN_ under the control of the camv promoter and investigated their aba sensitivity . we generated independent transgenic lines and after preliminary analysis we chose two representative transgenic lines for in depth analysis . as shown in fig . the transgenic lines exhibited some degree of growth retardation during early stage of seedling growth . however mature transgenic plants were similar to wild type plants in stature and size . to see if aba sensitivity was altered in the _PROTEIN_ ox lines we carried out aba dose response experiments at different developmental stages . first we examined aba response during the germination and seedling establishment stage . under normal growth condition seed germination of the transgenic lines was delayed somewhat compared with that of wild type plants but the degree of difference was very small and both wild type and transgenic seeds germinated in h after imbibition . in the presence of aba however transgenic seedling growth was much slower than the wild type growth . to address whether the enhanced growth inhibition is due to slower germination or slower shoot development we determined germination rates in the presence of aba . figure shows that wild type seed germination was inhibited by aba gradually . similarly transgenic seed germination was inhibited by aba but the degree of inhibition was greater than that of the wild type seed germination . for instance of wild type seeds germinated at aba whereas approximately of the transgenic seeds germinated at the same dose of aba . wild type seeds still retained germination efficiency at aba . by contrast the germination rates of the transgenic seeds _PROTEIN_ to less than . the hypersensitive response to aba was also observed in cotyledon greening process which is an indicator of shoot development . as shown in fig . the greening of transgenic cotyledons was more severely inhibited by aba than wild type cotyledons indicating the aba hypersensitivity during seedling establishment stage as well . thus our results indicated that _PROTEIN_ ox lines are aba hypersensitive during both germination and cotyledon greening stages . when seeds were germinated and seedlings were grown in the continuous presence of aba seedling growth was almost completely arrested by low concentration of aba . the germination assay results indicated that part of the reason for the retarded growth is the aba hypersensitivity of germination and shoot development of the transgenic plants . also it is possible that root growth itself may be aba hypersensitive . to address the question we next carried out primary root elongation assay . seedlings were grown in a medium lacking aba and then transferred to fresh media containing various concentrations of aba . their root elongation was then determined days after the transfer . figure shows that transgenic root elongation was more severely inhibited by aba than wild type roots . the hypersensitive response to aba was more prominent in the transgenic line with higher _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ level . the result indicates that primary root elongation of the _PROTEIN_ ox lines is also aba hypersensitive and that the degree of aba hypersensitivity is dependent on the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ level . collectively our data demonstrated that both germination and post germination growths of _PROTEIN_ ox lines are aba hypersensitive . one of the major roles of aba in seedlings is to mediate _PROTEIN_ responses to abiotic stresses such as water deficit high salinity and high osmolarity . during germination stage for instance aba mediates high salt response . as a result aba insensitive mutants are also insensitive to high salt whereas aba hypersensitive mutants are hypersensitive to salt . we therefore investigated whether stress responses were affected in the _PROTEIN_ ox lines . first we assessed the high salt response of the transgenic plants . seeds were plated on media containing or mm nacl and overall seedling growth was observed . figure shows that young seedling growth was more severely inhibited by nacl . we next determined seed germination and cotyledon greening efficiency to examine developmental stage dependence . figure shows that germination rates of transgenic seeds were more highly inhibited by nacl than those of the wild type seeds . similarly cotyledon greening of the transgenic plants was also more highly inhibited by nacl than that of the wild type seedlings . thus the transgenic plants were hypersensitive to high salt during germination and seedling establishment stage . we carried out similar experiments to assess high osmolarity response . seeds were plated on media containing or mannitol and overall growth seed germination and cotyledon greening efficiency were investigated . overall growth of young transgenic seedlings was more sensitive to mannitol than wild type seedlings and mannitol inhibition of seed germination was much higher in transgenic lines . in addition more severe inhibition of cotyledon greening was observed with transgenic seedlings . collectively our results indicated that _PROTEIN_ ox lines are hypersensitive to high salt and high osmolarity during seed germination and seedling establishment stage . because aba plays a key role in response to water deficit condition we examined the drought tolerance of the _PROTEIN_ ox lines . plants were grown for days in soil and then were subjected to water deficit condition by withholding water for weeks . after the treatment plants were re watered and their survival rates were scored . we did not observe clear difference in the survival rate of the transgenic line with low _PROTEIN_ level . however fig . shows that the survival rate of the transgenic line with high _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ level was much higher than the wild type survival rate . one of the roles of aba under water deficit condition is to reduce transpiration rates by controlling stomatal opening . we therefore determined the transpiration rates of the _PROTEIN_ ox lines . the result showed that transpiration rates of the transgenic lines were slightly lower than wild type rates but the degree of the difference was small . _PROTEIN_ was isolated as a binding protein as mentioned earlier . therefore we asked whether aba responsive gene _PROTEIN_ was affected by examining the transcript levels of typical aba or stress regulated genes such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and cbfs . among the genes we investigated _PROTEIN_ level was approximately fivefold higher in the transgenic lines . _PROTEIN_ which is a _PROTEIN_ class transcription _PROTEIN_ playing an important regulatory role in aba response during the germination and seedling establishment stages was also up regulated . additionally the _PROTEIN_ level of the transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which regulates cold responsive gene _PROTEIN_ was higher in the transgenic lines . thus we observed changes in the transcript levels of several aba or cold regulated genes .
plants _LOCATION_ were grown at under long day condition . for aseptic growth seeds were sterilized by treating sequentially with ethanol for min and bleach for min and then washed with sterile water five times . the sterilized seeds were plated on _METHOD_ medium solidified with phytoagar placed at for days for stratification and placed at normal growth condition . the _METHOD_ medium was supplemented with sucrose and if necessary supplemented with aba salt or mannitol as indicated . for soil growth seeds were spread on soil and after days of stratification at were placed at normal growth temperature . unless stated otherwise plants were watered once a week . rna was isolated employing the rneasy plant kit according to the manufacturer s instruction . northern blot analysis was carried out as described previously . real time rt pcr was conducted as described using primers listed in the supplementary table . histochemical gus assay of the transgenic plants harboring the _PROTEIN_ promoter gus construct was conducted as described before . for subcellular localization an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion construct was prepared by ligating the _PROTEIN_ coding region with _METHOD_ treated with xma i . the coding region of the _PROTEIN_ was prepared by pcr amplification using the primers aag cccggg _PROTEIN_ gaa _PROTEIN_ tcc caa tct tcc _PROTEIN_ and aag cccggg aca tga _PROTEIN_ cat aag aag _PROTEIN_ ttc and subsequently digested with xma i . the fusion construct was then agroinfiltrated into tobacco leaves as described before . the infiltrated tobacco leaves were observed h after infiltration with a _METHOD_ microscope equipped with appropriate filters . to prepare _PROTEIN_ ox lines the _PROTEIN_ coding region was amplified using the primers tgc tctaga ctt _PROTEIN_ gaa _PROTEIN_ tcc caa tct tcc a and aag _PROTEIN_ aac _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tca taa gaa g . the amplified fragment was digested with xba i and ligated with treated with xba i and eco icri . to prepare the promoter gus construct kb flanking sequence was amplified from genomic dna and after sal i/bam hi digestion ligated with treated with the same enzymes . to prepare rnai lines a bp fragment of the half of the coding region was amplified using the primers att taa tta agg cgc gcc ccc ggt gga _PROTEIN_ ggt tag and cgc gcc cta gga ttt aaa t tta _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ttt _PROTEIN_ gaa _PROTEIN_ . the amplified fragment was digested with asc i/swa i and ligated with which was cut with the same enzymes . the intermediate construct was then digested with pac i/avr ii and ligated with the amplified fragment cut with the same enzymes . arabidopsis transformation was carried out according to bechtold and pelletier . fifteen transgenic lines were generated and after preliminary analysis two lines were chosen for detailed analysis . for phenotype analyses generation homozygous plants were employed and for histochemical gus assay generation plants were employed . phenotype analyses were carried out as described unless stated otherwise . briefly germination was scored after imbibition in the dark on _METHOD_ medium supplemented with sucrose and when needed various concentrations of aba salt or mannitol . root elongation assay was carried out by measuring the primary root growth after the transfer of young seedlings from aba free medium to aba containing medium as indicated in the figure legends . for drought test day old plants grown in soil were withheld from water for weeks and re watered at the end of the treatment . survival rates were determined days after the re watering . to minimize experimental variations same numbers of plants were grown in the same tray .
