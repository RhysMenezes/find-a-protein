analysis of transcripts of genes encoding putative basic leucine zipper _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ in the arabidopsis genome identified _PROTEIN_ which was induced by tunicamycin . _PROTEIN_ encodes a predicted protein of aa with a putative transmembrane domain near its c terminus after a _PROTEIN_ domain . a truncated form of _PROTEIN_ without a transmembrane domain _PROTEIN_ fused with _METHOD_ localized to the _LOCATION_ suggesting translocation of native protein to the _LOCATION_ by release from the _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ was also induced by dtt and azetidine _PROTEIN_ which induce the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ stress response . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ clearly activated any of three bip and two calnexin promoters in a dual luciferase assay using protoplasts of cultured cells . the induction was considered to be through cis elements plant specific unfolded protein response element and _LOCATION_ stress response element . interestingly _PROTEIN_ also appeared to induce the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ through an _LOCATION_ stress response element like sequence in the promoter of _PROTEIN_ . these characteristics of _PROTEIN_ imply a signal transduction pathway of the _LOCATION_ stress response unique to plants .
_PROTEIN_ induced by tunicamycin was identified by using genomic information . we assumed that _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ play roles in the _LOCATION_ stress response of plants because _PROTEIN_ are involved in the response of yeast _PROTEIN_ and mammals _PROTEIN_ . thus according to the prediction of _PROTEIN_ genes in the arabidopsis genome they were screened one by one by rt pcr using rna prepared from arabidopsis leaves treated with and without tunicamycin an inhibitor of asparagine linked glycosylation that is generally used to induce the _LOCATION_ stress response . among the transcripts detected only transcripts of _PROTEIN_ were highly induced by tunicamycin and the induction was confirmed by rna gel blotting analysis . _PROTEIN_ encoded an orf consisting of aa having a _PROTEIN_ dna binding domain followed by a putative tmd . the putative tmd implies conversion of _PROTEIN_ to a soluble protein by proteolysis in response to _LOCATION_ stress in analogy to _PROTEIN_ in mammals . indeed a truncated _PROTEIN_ containing amino acids _PROTEIN_ which are fused to _METHOD_ localized to the _LOCATION_ when transiently _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was regulated by other _LOCATION_ stresses . to examine whether other agents inducing _LOCATION_ stress affect the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis seedlings treated with tunicamycin dtt or azetidine _PROTEIN_ were subjected to rna blot analysis . as shown in fig ref these agents also induced _PROTEIN_ as well as bip . as shown in fig ref the time course of _PROTEIN_ induction in response to tunicamycin treatment was quite similar to that of bip transcript induction in response to _LOCATION_ stress . promoters of bip and _PROTEIN_ were activated by truncated _PROTEIN_ . the arabidopsis genome contains three bip genes . two of them _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ including promoter and intron sequences are closely related to each other whereas _PROTEIN_ is different to some extent . the promoter of _PROTEIN_ lacks p upre a cis element responsible for the _LOCATION_ stress response that is found in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . instead the _PROTEIN_ promoter has two copies of _LOCATION_ which is also assumed to be a cis element responsible for the _LOCATION_ stress response . because the induction of bip represents the _LOCATION_ stress response the effect of _PROTEIN_ on induction of the three bip genes was examined by a dual luciferase assay in protoplasts of arabidopsis . to investigate the effect on other genes upregulated by _LOCATION_ stress we tested the promoters of the _PROTEIN_ genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which encode lectin like _LOCATION_ resident chaperones and contain _LOCATION_ in the promoters . first each of the three bip promoters and two _PROTEIN_ promoters all of which are fused to the firefly luciferase gene was introduced into protoplasts prepared from arabidopsis suspension cells . in transient assays treatment with tunicamycin clearly enhanced luciferase activity driven by all bip and _PROTEIN_ promoters indicating they were responsible for responding to _LOCATION_ stress . high induction of endogenous bip was also confirmed by rna blots . as a control promoter the promoter of _LOCATION_ heat shock inducible _PROTEIN_ was tested which was unaffected by tunicamycin treatment . using this assay system either intact _PROTEIN_ or the truncated form _PROTEIN_ was coexpressed under the camv promoter . as a control effector we used gus and _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ involved in signal transduction of photomorphogenesis because _PROTEIN_ showed the highest similarity with in a database search of the arabidopsis genome . although gus _PROTEIN_ and the intact _PROTEIN_ did not affect induction of luciferase activity coexpression of _PROTEIN_ clearly enhanced luciferase activity driven by all bip and _PROTEIN_ promoters . the level of induction was higher for the _PROTEIN_ promoter than for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ promoter was again not affected . activation of promoters was through p upre and _LOCATION_ . as described above p upre and _LOCATION_ have been considered responsible for the _LOCATION_ stress response . thus it was likely that activation of bip and _PROTEIN_ promoters by _PROTEIN_ depends on these ciselements . to examine whether this hypothesis were true the effect of _PROTEIN_ on p upre and _LOCATION_ dependent induction was analyzed . a hexamer of either p upre or _LOCATION_ fused to the camv minimal promoter and the luciferase gene was subjected to a luciferase reporter assay using protoplasts in the same way as described above . as shown in fig ref p upre responded to tunicamycin as reported in ref . citation . _LOCATION_ also responded to tunicamycin indicating that _LOCATION_ was sufficient for the _LOCATION_ stress response in plants as predicted . when _PROTEIN_ was coexpressed under the camv promoter luciferase activities driven by p upre and _LOCATION_ were clearly enhanced in contrast to gus 's lack of effect on coexpression . these results suggested that _PROTEIN_ activates the bip and _PROTEIN_ promoter in an _LOCATION_ and p upre dependent manner in response to _LOCATION_ stress . _PROTEIN_ induces its own transcription through an _LOCATION_ like sequence . we fused kb of the promoter region of _PROTEIN_ to a gus reporter gene and introduced the promoter into arabidopsis . gus activity was clearly induced in the transgenic plants by tunicamycin suggesting that the promoter responded to _LOCATION_ stress . because _PROTEIN_ was induced during the _LOCATION_ stress response similarly to bip _PROTEIN_ may induce its own transcription . indeed the promoter of _PROTEIN_ contains a sequence ccaat tcaag similar to the general _LOCATION_ sequence ccaat ccacg . as indicated in fig ref ccaat is conserved exactly and tcaag has two base mismatches with the ccacg . we predicted that this _LOCATION_ like sequence functions in the induction of _PROTEIN_ . to test this prediction a mutation was introduced into the _LOCATION_ like sequence and subjected to transient luciferase assay . as shown in fig ref an authentic _PROTEIN_ promoter responded to tunicamycin however the mutated promoter showed little response to tunicamycin . this result indicates that the induction of _PROTEIN_ depends on the _LOCATION_ like sequence . comparison of the induction rate between fig ref suggests that clear induction is easily observed in stable transformants . subsequently the effect of _PROTEIN_ on the _PROTEIN_ promoter was examined . as shown in fig ref coexpression of _PROTEIN_ clearly activated the authentic _PROTEIN_ promoter . however this activation was almost completely abolished by mutation of the _LOCATION_ like sequence suggesting that _PROTEIN_ activates its own transcription through the _LOCATION_ like sequence .
