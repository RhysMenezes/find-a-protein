trafficking of seed storage proteins to protein storage _LOCATION_ is mediated by _PROTEIN_ terminal and internal sorting determinants . protein modelling was used to identify candidate isds residing near surface exposed regions in arabidopsis thaliana cruciferin a . these were verified by atcrua fusion to yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ in developing embryos of a. thaliana . as the presence of endogenous cruciferin was found to mask the effects of weaker isds experiments were conducted in a line that was devoid of cruciferin . in total nine isds were discovered and a core determinant defined using a series of alanine scanning and deletion mutant variants . coupling of functional data from atcrua isd _METHOD_ fusions with statistical analysis of the physiochemical properties of analogous regions from several globulins revealed that cruciferin isds likely adhere to the following rules isds are adjacent to or within hydrophilic surface exposed regions that serve to present them on the protein s surface isds generally have a hydrophobic character isds tend to have leu or ile residues at their core isds are approximately eight amino acids long with the physiochemical consensus _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . microscopic evidence is also presented for the presence of an interconnected protein storage _LOCATION_ network in embryo cells rather than discreet individual _LOCATION_ .
in silico modeling of the monomeric form of atcrua revealed five surface exposed regions four of which were spatially analogous to the drs found in the soybean proglycinin trimer . previous studies indicated that these regions may either contain isds or help to display them on the surface of the protein . extending these studies we appended the atcrua dr as well as surface exposed amino acids adjacent to them to _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ the fusion proteins in a. thaliana plants . initially a single construct containing a region with a known isd _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in wild type a. thaliana plants as well as in a plant line devoid of cruciferin . the rationale for this was based on the notion that competition with endogenous cruciferin for receptor molecules makes identification of weaker individual sorting determinants difficult in a wild type background . indeed we observed strong psv localization with the known isd linked to _METHOD_ in the cruciferin deficient mutant but only limited or no psv localization in the wild type line . as in earlier studies we appended either four or six glycine residues to the putative isds since this places the determinants in an internal context and blocks a weak cryptic psv sorting determinant present near the _PROTEIN_ terminus of _METHOD_ . resides at the amino terminus of the protein and is situated at the base of the barrel that defines the cupin domain . _METHOD_ fused to along with the amino acids _PROTEIN_ terminal to it was neither secreted nor localized to the psv . rather the majority of the protein remained within the cell in what appears to be the endomembrane system . _METHOD_ fused to along with the amino terminal amino acids was mostly secreted though a small amount was observed in the psv . _METHOD_ fused to with the _PROTEIN_ terminal amino acids was also secreted but a higher proportion was found in the psv suggesting that this region contains a weak isd . similar to _METHOD_ fused to and the amino terminal amino acids was mostly secreted while _METHOD_ fused to and the _PROTEIN_ terminal amino acids was secreted and localized to the psv in approximately similar proportions . the region between and _PROTEIN_ is an helical region that interacts with the helical region upstream of to form the trimer . this was examined separately as an isd was found previously in this area that being the nifgrf motif in the a. hypochondriacus globulin amaranthin . indeed _METHOD_ fused to the _PROTEIN_ region was strongly localized to the psv . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ an extended loop that laps onto the barrel of the adjacent protomer to further stabilize the trimer . _METHOD_ fused to _PROTEIN_ and either the amino or _PROTEIN_ terminal amino acids was strongly localized to the psv . the region _PROTEIN_ terminal to _PROTEIN_ contains the amino acids icsar at the same location as the ictmr isd of the g. max glycinin . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ terminal amino acids from a. thaliana crub which contains lctmr at the analogous location was more effective in directing _METHOD_ to the psv . comprises the _PROTEIN_ terminal amino acids and was shown to contain both a _PROTEIN_ terminal sorting determinant and an isd . we examined the area upstream of this which _METHOD_ an helical region that as noted above interacts with the to _PROTEIN_ helical region of an adjacent protomer in the trimer . is at the end of atcrua and was shown to contain a putative ctsd therefore this region was excluded from the construct . however when fused to the region upstream of _METHOD_ was strongly localized to the psv indicating that a strong isd was also present . the identification of isds and an associated physiochemical property isd consensus was conducted using a combination of empirical and informatics approaches and is described in detail below . in brief regions adjacent to the drs in atcrua were tested for their ability to localize _METHOD_ to the psv . amino acid blocks centered on ile or leu were then compiled from regions that exhibited some ability to localize _METHOD_ to the psv as well as from the analogous regions in the other a. thaliana cruciferins . a consensus for each position was developed based on over representation of amino acid physiochemical properties relative to random surface exposed regions . application of this physiochemical consensus back to atcrua yielded a list of putative isds that were appended to _METHOD_ and tested in planta . a refined physiochemical consensus was then determined by comparing only functional atcrua determinants . mutation analysis was used to better define the length of the isd and amino acids critical to their function . finally hidden markov models were used to identify an isd consensus for each individual determinant by comparison to analogous regions in other globulins . nine of the ten regions tested in the first generation constructs showed some level of psv localization . in earlier studies substitution of the ile or leu residue was shown to inactivate the _LOCATION_ targeting isds in glycinin conglycinin ricin r. communis albumin and ipomoea batatas sporamin . in accordance a second set of constructs was designed to identify individual isds within the regions flanking the drs with either ile or leu at the core of the determinant . in total ile/leu residues were present in the regions that showed some psv targeting in the first generation constructs . a tiered screening process was used to select regions more likely to be isds . initially three regions in which the ile/leu was within three amino acids of the end of the tested regions were excluded since the isd is likely to be incomplete . subsequently the atcrua regions were aligned with the homologous regions of atcrub atcrub and atcruc . it is worth noting that all of the remaining atcrua ile/leu regions were conserved in at least one other atcru member . the list was further refined by removing three putative isds obtained from very weak psv targeting regions leaving putative atcrua isds and putative isd sequences from all four cruciferins . the frequency of individual amino acids at each position was calculated but no consensus was obvious . subsequently the representation of amino acids with or without specific chemical properties was determined for each position . two methods were then used to identify a physiochemical consensus . firstly the most common physiochemical properties at each position were determined yielding the following consensus _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which can also be written as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or . secondly recognizing that some physiochemical properties are more common in surface exposed regions an average and standard deviation for each property in the regions tested was determined by comparison to a reference set comprising eighteen amino acid blocks from surface exposed regions in the four a. thaliana cruciferins . this resulted in a similar but more refined consensus that included fewer amino acids than the first as follows _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which can also be written or _PROTEIN_ . several _PROTEIN_ were considered when determining the length of the putative isds to test in the second generation constructs . firstly the isds in amaranthin and glycinin include four amino acids downstream of the ile residue the last of which coincided with the highly significant amino acid in the consensus at position . position was also highly significant but with a requirement for a tiny amino acid that is provided by the first gly in the hexa glycine appendage . secondly the amaranthin and glycinin isds included either no or a single amino acid upstream of the ile/leu however amino acids with significantly over represented physiochemical properties were found one two three and five residues upstream of the ile/leu at consensus positions and respectively . since the penultimate amino acid in _METHOD_ _METHOD_ to the consensus for position the second generation constructs consisted of eight amino acids . when the two related eight amino acid consensuses were applied to the regions flanking the drs in atcrua of the potential isds were identified by one or both methods as having less than three mismatches . eleven isds were selected for further analysis including the regions analogous to the amaranthin and glycinin isds . in addition the putative isd from atcrub was included since it was more similar to the glycinin isd than that found in atcrua . when these eight amino acid sequences were fused to _METHOD_ of showed some psv localization activity . the original _METHOD_ fusion to indicated that weak isds may reside in the amino and _PROTEIN_ terminal regions . fusion of the amino terminal _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ terminal vehirsgd sequences to _METHOD_ directed only a small amount or none of the fusion protein to the psv respectively . the _PROTEIN_ region contained three putative individual isds including qknifngf which is in an analogous position to the nifgrf determinant from amaranthin . the atcrua qknifngf sequence was a relatively strong sorting determinant and directed most of the _METHOD_ to the psv as did alkidlqt . the aqalkidl sequence which comprises part of the determinant was weaker and directed only some of the _METHOD_ to the psv . in the original construct _PROTEIN_ and the amino terminal region strongly directed _METHOD_ to the psv . the _PROTEIN_ sequence from this region also functioned as an isd though more weakly in this context . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ terminal region was a relatively strong isd . this region contains the sequence icsar in atcrua and lctmr in atcrub which are similar and in analogous locations to the glycinin sorting determinant ictmr . the _METHOD_ fusion containing the crua eeticsar sequence was mostly secreted however the fusion protein containing the crub eetlctmr which is more similar to the glycinin determinant was partially directed to the psv . the region amino terminal to strongly localized _METHOD_ to the psv and three individual sorting determinants were found in this region . _PROTEIN_ was a strong sorting determinant while _PROTEIN_ and fntlettl were weaker but did direct some _METHOD_ to the psv . to further define the minimal requirements for an isd a series of alanine scanning and deletion mutants were generated based on the atcrua qknifngf sequence . the analogous region in amaranthin _PROTEIN_ is also a known isd . the qknifngf sequence was a moderate to strong isd and directed about half of the _METHOD_ to the psv with the remainder secreted to the apoplast . mutational analysis of an isd with intermediate strength allowed identification of changes that either reduced or improved sorting efficiency . replacement of the asn by ala greatly increased the proportion of _METHOD_ that was secreted though a small amount was still directed to the psv . replacement of the ile which was presumed to be at the core of the motif or the phe residue immediately adjacent to it with ala reduced but did not abolish sorting of _METHOD_ to the psv . replacement of the second asn had no effect on sorting of _METHOD_ to the psv . interestingly replacement of the glycine with alanine both of which have similar physiochemical properties slightly increased isd function resulting in exclusive localization of the _METHOD_ to the psv . conversely deletion of gln or gln and the adjacent lys residue from the amino terminus of the isd greatly _PROTEIN_ the proportion of _METHOD_ sorted to the psv . similarly deletion of one or more of the _PROTEIN_ terminal amino acids severely affected isd function suggesting that the minimal functional length of this particular isd is at least eight residues . interestingly deletion of the gln lys and asn residues restored isd sorting capacity . this might be due to amino acids at the _PROTEIN_ terminus of _METHOD_ that are now in these positions the first and third of which conform to the consensus . attempts were made to identify an isd consensus among isds that directed at least some _METHOD_ to the psv . the secondary structure surrounding the core i/l residue in the a. thaliana cruciferin isds was determined by predict protein as well as by homology modeling using either the g. max proglycinin and b. napus cruciferin as templates . no sheet structure was detected in any of the isds and no apparent consensus was found as to the location or length of helical regions . the physiochemical properties of the most functional a. thaliana isds were also compared which yielded the following consensus _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which can also be written as _PROTEIN_ . of note was the preponderance of hydrophobic amino acids adjacent to charged and/or _PROTEIN_ amino acids . hydrophobic amino acids are normally in reduced abundance on the surface of proteins and this may impart the isd with a unique a physiochemical signature . an attempt was also made to define an isd consensus using hidden markov models . initially seven isds from atcrua were aligned and used to generate a hmm . and were excluded since they are weak or non functional . was also a weak determinant but was included since it is analogous to the amaranthin isd . when the tair database was searched with this model no results were returned . to increase the power of the hmm the analogous atcrub and atcruc isd regions were included in the analysis . a search of the tair database with this hmm returned all three cruciferins with of input isds . when the search was extended to the b. rapa and b. oleracea databases cruciferin was identified with the same of input isds . when the search was further extended to all plant sequences in the ncbi refseq database no hits were returned . this was not unexpected since the hmm was based on short peptide sequences which have an increased likelihood of being present by chance within a larger database causing the e value to drop below the significance threshold . when analogous isd regions from a variety of dicots were aligned it was noted that there was more conservation of isds within a group than between isd groups . analogous regions corresponding to seven functional a. thaliana isds were aligned and used as input to create _METHOD_ for each isd . was excluded since it was not conserved outside the brassicaceae . when the individual isd alignments were used as hmm input and the resulting models used to search the tair b. rapa or b. oleracea databases and returned cruciferin or cruciferin like proteins while and did not . in some cases proteins that were unlikely to be targeted to the psv were returned but all of these were predicted to contain multiples of a single isd which inflated the scores . in total three a. thaliana four b. rapa and five b. oleraceae cruciferins were identified . a search of the plant delimited ncbi refseq database with these hmm models failed to return any cupin domain proteins . as before this is likely due to the short length of the input sequences relative to the large size of the database searched . two dimensional images of embryo cells accumulating _METHOD_ protein fusions in this and other studies show what appear to be numerous discreet psvs of varying sizes shapes and _METHOD_ intensities . during the course of the localization studies above it was noted that when _METHOD_ was appended to a strong isd and _PROTEIN_ in the cruciferin deficient plant line the _METHOD_ signal co localized completely with psv _METHOD_ . a similar observation was made previously with red _METHOD_ proteins attached to ricin or phaseolin psv sorting determinants . when we examined z stacks of the psv _METHOD_ connections between the psvs appeared to be present . to explore this further high resolution z stacks of embryo cells in seeds of a cruciferin deficient line _PROTEIN_ sp _METHOD_ were combined to form a three dimensional image of the psvs . the psv _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ signals again co localized however psv _METHOD_ was preferred for imaging since it was observed with a shorter photon excitation wavelength resulting in better resolution and had a better signal to noise ratio that yielded a cleaner image . two photon confocal microscopy was used to minimize bleaching in the large z stack . this analysis revealed that the psvs are not discreet individual spherical entities but rather are part of an interconnected network . irregular shaped nodes that appear as distinct _LOCATION_ when observed on a single plane by conventional microscopy were shown to be fused to other nodes or connected by short passages . for two cells the ratio of cell to psv volume was determined which indicated that the total volume of the cell occupied by the psv network ranged from to .
constructs to identify and characterize isds comprised the atcrua signal peptide fused to the n terminus of enhanced yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ followed by putative sorting determinants from atcrua and in one case atcrub . four or six glycine residues were appended to the c terminus to mask any cryptic _PROTEIN_ terminal protein sorting determinants as per maruyama et al . and petruccelli et al . . the constructs were generated using soeing pcr . the sequences of all primers are provided in supplemental table . the first generation constructs used to identify putative isds used oligonucleotides of bp in length that were cloned into after synthesis _PROTEIN_ . the oligonucleotide encoding the signal peptide also encoded the first seven amino acids of _METHOD_ . the other oligonucleotides encoded the last seven amino acids of _METHOD_ followed by the atcrua region to be tested and four glycine residues . each oligonucleotide was flanked by bfuai restriction sites . pcr primers were generated by digestion with bfuai which cuts precisely four nucleotides and eight nucleotides from the recognition site leaving termini that were complementary to _METHOD_ . the oligonucleotide encoding the atcrua signal peptide also contained a kpni restriction site internal to the bfuai while the oligonucleotides encoding the sorting determinants contained a saci restriction site internal to the bfuai to allow for subsequent subcloning of the constructs into a plant transformation vector . the first soeing pcr reaction fused the signal peptide to _METHOD_ while the second reaction incorporated the isd . the second set of constructs comprised the atcrua signal peptide fused to the amino terminus of _METHOD_ followed by eight amino acids encoding a putative isd fused to six glycine residues . constructs were generated by amplifying the sp _METHOD_ using the forward primer pnap_cra_f kpn and construct specific reverse primers which encoded the isd to be tested and glycine residues followed by a saci restriction site . four to six bp extensions were included adjacent to the termini of the saci and kpni restriction sites to allow efficient digestion of the pcr product . the third set of constructs comprised the atcrua signal peptide fused to the amino terminus of _METHOD_ followed by a modified isd based on qknifngf fused to six glycine residues . two types of modifications were tested a series of alanine scanning mutants and a series of serial deletions of the qknifngf sequence . constructs were generated using the same methods as in the second set above . for all constructs the resultant pcr products were digested with kpni and saci and cloned into n in escherichia coli . n is a derivative of in which the camv promoter was replaced with the seed specific napin promoter . napin and cruciferin are the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in a. thaliana and the genes encoding them have very similar _PROTEIN_ patterns according to the _PROTEIN_ microarray database . the plasmids were then introduced into agrobacterium tumefaciens for plant transformation . arabidopsis thaliana ecotype columbia and a cruciferin deficient line were propagated under controlled conditions . to generate the cruciferin deficient plant line the following t dna insertion lines obtained from either the arabidopsis biological resources centre or gabi kat were used cruacrubcruc cruacrubcruc and cruacrubcruc _PROTEIN_ . a homozygous triple knockout line was obtained by several rounds of conventional crossing and selection with appropriate pcr primers . arabidopsis thaliana plants were transformed using the floral dip method modified to include a s exposure to vacuum immediately after dipping . this was found to reduce the tissue damage observed when the vacuum was applied during the dipping procedure and improved transformation efficiency . plants transformed with the neomycin phosphotransferase selection marker were identified as follows . seeds were sterilized and then placed at for days in sterile agar . sterile seeds were germinated and grown on _METHOD_ agar with timentin and kanamycin for days . epi _METHOD_ microscopy was used to evaluate the localization of the various cruciferin _METHOD_ fusion constructs . mature a. thaliana seeds were soaked in _METHOD_ for h. the embryos were removed from the seed coat by gently pressing them between a slide and a cover slip in _METHOD_ and transferred to a drop of _METHOD_ on a new slide for live cell imaging . embryos were viewed on a zeiss compound microscope outfitted with an apotome . a apochromat water immersion lens was used in conjunction with the _METHOD_ filter and a dic lens . _METHOD_ was negligible as it only became visible with exposure times over s and most images of _METHOD_ were taken with exposure times of s or less . control images of the non transformed line were taken over a range of settings however at the exposure times used to visualize _METHOD_ in psv these were dark fields . exposure times for every sample were noted since the levels of _PROTEIN_ varied between independent events/lines per construct and poorly _PROTEIN_ lines were excluded from the analysis to avoid long exposure times . images were viewed and exported in.tiff format using axiovision . for each construct five cotyledons from each of three independent transformed lines were viewed . if a consensus phenotype was not obvious two additional independent lines were assessed . confocal microscopy was used to visualize psvs in three dimensions . mature a. thaliana seeds containing the sp _METHOD_ construct which is completely localized to the psv were soaked in _METHOD_ for h. the embryos were removed from the seed coat by gently pressing them between a slide and a cover slip in _METHOD_ and transferred to a drop of _METHOD_ on a new slide for live cell imaging . embryos were viewed on a zeiss lsm compound microscope outfitted with a tunable sapphire laser and an argon laser . the _METHOD_ signal was detected using nm excitation and a nm emission filter . psv _METHOD_ was detected using photon imaging with nm excitation a long pass nm filter and a non descanned detector . in the cruciferin deficient line the sp _METHOD_ signal co localizes with psv _METHOD_ . at nm excitation only psv _METHOD_ was detected while the _METHOD_ was not excited allowing exclusive imaging of psvs . a apochromat water immersion lens was used to obtain a z stack of high quality images . images were deconvolved using autoquant . at nm excitation with a lens numerical aperture of and a condenser na of the theoretical resolution was . imaris software was used to create images from the z stack data . the theoretical structure of atcrua was predicted using the swiss model server . the template identification tool was used to identify the best template for modeling atcrua . the settings used for the interpro domain scan were hmmpfam hmmtigr profilescan superfamily blastprodom . the settings for the gapped blast query were e value cut off _PROTEIN_ and alignments . chain a from the crystal structure of procruciferin globulin from brassica napus with a resolution of _METHOD_ had the best alignment and was used as the template for homology modeling . the quaternary structure of atcrua was assumed by the swiss model server to be identical . the constructed model was structurally aligned to the template using swiss pdb viewer . untemplated regions in the model _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were modeled using the modloop server . energy minimization was performed with the implementation in swiss pdb . the energy calculated for the atcrua model was kj/mol . the trimer was assembled using the matchmaker function in chimera with the following default settings alignment algorithm _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . imaging of the protein was done in chimera . the physiochemical property of amino acid r groups was assessed as per the scheme of livingstone and barton . secondary structure was determined using predict protein as well as by homology modeling using either the g. max proglycinin or brassica napus cruciferin as templates . hidden markov models were developed using hmmer and searched against the tair brassica rapa brassica oleraceae and ncbi refseq protein databases . the globulins used were a. hypochondriacus amaranthin a. thaliana crua crub crub and cruc arachis hypogaea ara h b. napus cruciferin cucurbita maxima globulin g. max glycinin and pisum sativum legumin .
