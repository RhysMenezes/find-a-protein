the local distribution of both the _LOCATION_ type proton _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the _LOCATION_ type proton pyrophosphatase _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ proton pumps was investigated in intact _LOCATION_ isolated from arabidopsis suspension cultured cells . _METHOD_ immunostaining showed that v _PROTEIN_ was distributed evenly on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but v _PROTEIN_ localized to specific regions of the vm . we hypothesize that there may be _LOCATION_ microdomains on the vm . to confirm this hypothesis we prepared detergent resistant _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ from the vm in accordance with well established conventional methods . analyses of fatty acid composition suggested that _METHOD_ had more saturated fatty acids compared with the whole vm in phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine . in the proteomic analyses of both _METHOD_ and detergent soluble mebranes _METHOD_ we confirmed the different local distributions of v _PROTEIN_ and v _PROTEIN_ . the observations of _METHOD_ with an electron microscope supported the existence of different areas on the vm . moreover it was observed using total internal reflection _METHOD_ microscopy _PROTEIN_ that proton pumps were frequently immobilized at specific sites on the vm . in the proteomic analyses we also found that many other _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins are distributed differently in _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . based on the results of this study we discuss the possibility that vm microdomains might contribute to _LOCATION_ dynamics .
in order to visualize the distribution of v _PROTEIN_ and v _PROTEIN_ isolated intact _LOCATION_ were immunostained and observed with a confocal laser microscope . counterstaining of the immunostained _LOCATION_ with fm a lipophilic dye to visualize the vm frequently stained intravacuolar structures . _METHOD_ from v _PROTEIN_ or v _PROTEIN_ overlapped with that of fm in the vm and it appeared that v _PROTEIN_ was clustered in small areas on the isolated _LOCATION_ but v _PROTEIN_ was more evenly distributed . the differential distribution of v _PROTEIN_ and v _PROTEIN_ was confirmed by staining them together on the same vm and visualizing them at different wavelengths . when focused on the equatorial plane of the _LOCATION_ the _METHOD_ from the v _PROTEIN_ was observed as discrete large dots at only a few locations whereas the _METHOD_ from the v _PROTEIN_ was relatively even . the variation in distribution was more obvious when focusing on the surface of the _LOCATION_ which revealed a large number of small _METHOD_ spots _PROTEIN_ and a smaller number of much large spots _PROTEIN_ . fig . and b shows the _METHOD_ images of v _PROTEIN_ or v _PROTEIN_ captured by total internal reflection _METHOD_ microscopy _PROTEIN_ . almost all _METHOD_ signals actively moved on the _LOCATION_ . the behavior of _METHOD_ spots was traced for frames and plotted . both v _PROTEIN_ and v _PROTEIN_ often remained still at certain places on the vm for a short time . diffusion coefficients were calculated from the trace of _METHOD_ signals for frames . the coefficients of v _PROTEIN_ were calculated from traces and that of v _PROTEIN_ from traces . fig . shows the distribution of all calculated values . the average values were similar _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but the medians were clearly different _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we hypothesized that the different behavior of the two h pumps on the same _LOCATION_ resulted from the existence of _LOCATION_ microdomains in the vm . thus _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ of the isolated intact _LOCATION_ were purified by conventional methods . drm and dsm proteins were separated on an _PROTEIN_ polyacrylamide gel . the band patterns visualized with silver staining were different between _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . in order to compare the v _PROTEIN_ and v _PROTEIN_ content of each fraction we conducted western blotting using purified specific antibodies against v _PROTEIN_ a subunit v _PROTEIN_ e subunit or v _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . both vha a and vha e subunit proteins were more strongly detected in the drm fraction than in the dsm fraction . on the other hand v _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was more abundant in the dsm fraction . the lipid composition of the whole vm and the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ were analysed by liquid chromatography tandem _METHOD_ spectromety _METHOD_ . phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylethanolamine phosphatidylinositol _PROTEIN_ phosphatidylglycerol and lysophosphatidylcholine were detected in the vm . peak and peak in fig . show that the vm contains other lipid species that do not correspond to the common phospholipids . the drm fraction _PROTEIN_ consisted of pe and pc . glycosylceramide was also detected in both fractions with a retention time around min . the fatty acid composition was also analyzed by lc _METHOD_ . fig . h and i j shows the distribution of the m/z for pc and pe . the number of _PROTEIN_ and double bonds in fatty acids were presented as the sum of the two fatty acids of each lipid molecule . _METHOD_ had more saturated fatty acids compared with the whole vm in pc and pe . as for glccers variation in the saturation ratio was observed in the very long chain fatty acids . the microstructures of the vm and _LOCATION_ drm were also examined with an electron microscope . the vm was observed as aggregates of small _LOCATION_ vesicles whereas the _LOCATION_ drm was observed as _LOCATION_ fragments . each fragment of the _LOCATION_ drm was very small with a large curvature . further we confirmed the accumulation of v _PROTEIN_ on the _LOCATION_ drm with immunoelectron microscopy . fig . and g shows the localization of gold particles indicating v _PROTEIN_ or v _PROTEIN_ on the vm . both antibodies showed similar distributions . this was also confirmed using the isolated vm fractions . in the _LOCATION_ drm fraction gold particles against v _PROTEIN_ located much more than those against v _PROTEIN_ . the composition of the _LOCATION_ fractions was examined by proteomic analysis . the analyses were conducted three times and revealed unique proteins . of these were found in _METHOD_ and in _METHOD_ . all identified proteins are listed in supplementary table . in tables proteins which have > matched peptides are listed . tables and supplementary table show identified proteins with the locus annotations by tair the number of matched peptides and the number of transmembrane domains . the numbers of matched peptides indicate the total number of peptides detected in one experiment and are shown for a rough estimation of the total amount of each protein . table shows the list of subunits of the proton pumps . almost all subunits of v _PROTEIN_ were identified in _METHOD_ . the numbers of matched peptides of these subunits in _METHOD_ significantly exceeded those in _METHOD_ . the numbers of vha and vha were small compared with those of other _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ was slightly more prevalent in _METHOD_ than in _METHOD_ . many types of transporters and channels were found in both fractions . nineteen abc transporters were identified in the present study . most of the abcc type transporters were _PROTEIN_ present in _METHOD_ while more abcb type and abcg type transporters were detected in _METHOD_ than in _METHOD_ . mate family transporters were _PROTEIN_ identified in _METHOD_ while ion transporters sugar transporters _PROTEIN_ and channels were detected in both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . _LOCATION_ traffic related proteins were identified . in particular _PROTEIN_ iii complex related proteins were localized in _METHOD_ and small g proteins were localized in _METHOD_ . some dynamin like proteins were identified in _METHOD_ . band family proteins were detected in _METHOD_ much more than in _METHOD_ .
