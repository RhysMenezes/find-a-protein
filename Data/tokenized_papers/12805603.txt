transcription of chloroplast genes is subject to control by _LOCATION_ encoded proteins . the chloroplast encoded rna polymerase _PROTEIN_ is a eubacterial type rna polymerase that is presumed to assemble with _LOCATION_ encoded _PROTEIN_ mediating promoter recognition . recently families of _PROTEIN_ genes have been identified in several plants including arabidopsis . one of these genes arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ encodes a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which is phylogenetically distinct from the other family members . to investigate the role of this plant _PROTEIN_ two different insertional alleles of the _PROTEIN_ gene were identified and characterized . heterozygous mutant plants showed no visible leaf phenotype but exhibited siliques containing aborted embryos and unfertilized ovules . our inability to recover plants homozygous for a _PROTEIN_ gene disruption indicates that _PROTEIN_ is an essential gene . _PROTEIN_ transcripts accumulate in flower tissues consistent with a role for _PROTEIN_ protein in reproduction . therefore _PROTEIN_ encodes an essential member of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ family that plays a role in plant reproduction in addition to its previously proposed role in leaf chloroplast gene _PROTEIN_ .
to study the function of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis we screened two collections of insertional mutants for lines with t dnas located within the _PROTEIN_ gene . one such t dna tagged line was recovered from each collection . the _PROTEIN_ allele was identified in the ws ecotype by pcr based screens of dna pools derived from a collection of arabidopsis lines transformed with a derivative of the t dna vector . in the recovered line the t dna insertion was located after nucleotide number of _PROTEIN_ exon . this insertion would generate an _PROTEIN_ protein truncated in conserved region and completely missing conserved region . because these conserved domains are essential for bacterial _PROTEIN_ activity it is presumed that a truncated _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ from _PROTEIN_ would be nonfunctional . the second t dna insertional allele _PROTEIN_ was detected in the columbia ecotype by screening a database of left border flanking sequences recovered by thermal asymmetric interlaced pcr from a collection of approximately individual t dna mutagenized arabidopsis plants . in the identified line the insertion follows nucleotide number of the second exon of the _PROTEIN_ gene and would generate an _PROTEIN_ protein missing all of the conserved domains essential for bacterial _PROTEIN_ activity . thus any protein _PROTEIN_ from _PROTEIN_ would be predicted not to function as a _PROTEIN_ . dna gel blots revealed more than one t dna insertion site in the line containing _PROTEIN_ . dna gel blot analyses on _PROTEIN_ dna digested with restriction endonucleases that did not cut within the t dna indicated a single t dna insertion site in the _PROTEIN_ line . the large size of the restriction fragment hybridizing to the t dna derived bar gene probe revealed that multiple t dnas had been inserted at that site . this was confirmed by pcr analysis although the exact arrangement and number of the t dnas was not determined . because the _PROTEIN_ line contained t dnas at a single insertion site most of our analysis was done with the progeny of this line . we note that the phenotypes observed with the _PROTEIN_ line were also seen in progeny from the _PROTEIN_ line . disruption of the gene for a _LOCATION_ localized _PROTEIN_ could potentially generate plants with defects in chloroplast gene _PROTEIN_ and development leading to a visible pale green leaf phenotype . because heterozygous mutant _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines had no visible leaf phenotype we attempted to uncover lines homozygous for either allele . however in neither case were any homozygous progeny recovered from selfed heterozygous mutant plants . the and progeny from _PROTEIN_ selfed heterozygotes were two thirds _PROTEIN_ resistant and one third sensitive consistent with the lack of viable homozygous progeny . sixty t dna containing progeny _PROTEIN_ of selfed _PROTEIN_ heterozygotes were analyzed by pcr for the presence or absence of a wild type _PROTEIN_ allele and for the presence of the _PROTEIN_ allele . in each case both a wild type and a mutant allele were recovered demonstrating the presence of only heterozygous progeny . the lack of homozygous progeny indicated that _PROTEIN_ might be essential for normal seed or embryo development . therefore siliques from selfed heterozygous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines were examined for defective seeds . in both of the mutant lines small wrinkled seeds and normal looking seeds were detected in mature siliques . in addition some immature siliques of both mutant lines contained gaps in the seed rows indicative of multiple unfertilized ovules present between normal looking developing seeds . this was in contrast to the immature siliques of wild type plants which were filled with round green seeds . a comparison of the appearance of unfertilized ovules and aborted embryos in mutant versus wild type plants demonstrated a significantly higher frequency of defective siliques in the mutant plants compared with the wild type . the semisterility detected in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants was not found in all siliques of the heterozygous _PROTEIN_ lines . moreover within a silique exhibiting defective seeds or unfertilized ovules the percentage of embryo or fertilization defects was not consistently as would be expected for a recessive lethal gene defect but was higher or lower depending on the silique . in each mutant heterozygous plant some effected siliques contained up to unfertilized ovules and could be identified without dissection because they were visibly shorter than other siliques on the plant . frequency of defective siliques in selfed wild type plants compared with selfed heterozygous _PROTEIN_ plants siliques were opened with a razor blade and contents were examined under a dissecting microscope . an average of siliques were scored per plant . note that percentages do not total for each plant genotype because some siliques exhibited both aborted embryos and unfertilized ovules . these observations indicate that the semisterility of _PROTEIN_ mutant plants is leaky . in this respect the _PROTEIN_ lines resemble mutants in the arabidopsis prolifera gene . a prolifera gene trap line exhibited homozygous embryo lethality with heterozygous siliques containing a few unfertilized ovules as well as seeds with aborted embryos . it is proposed that the prolifera silique phenotype is variable due to a varying requirement for maternal stores of the prolifera rna or protein during different stages of female gametogenesis and zygote development . the similarity in phenotype could reflect a similar function for the _PROTEIN_ gene product . alternatively the leaky nature of the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype could be due to partial complementation of the disrupted gene by other members of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ gene family . the silique phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines indicated that _PROTEIN_ may be required for gametogenesis and/or early embryogenesis . if this is the case the _PROTEIN_ gene should be _PROTEIN_ in reproductive tissues in wild type plants . previously published analysis of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ detected _PROTEIN_ transcripts in whole d old seedlings that had been ground up for rna extraction and in rosette leaves of week old plants . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in rosette leaves agrees with the previously proposed role for _PROTEIN_ in chloroplast gene _PROTEIN_ . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ also accumulates in reproductive tissues we did immunoblots on both vegetative and reproductive plant organs using an antibody raised against the terminal region of _PROTEIN_ . because the terminus of _PROTEIN_ is not conserved with the other arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ this antibody is specific for the _PROTEIN_ protein . immunoblot analysis detected a band of the mr predicted for _PROTEIN_ in rosette leaves _METHOD_ immature siliques and flowers but not in roots . a lower mr protein also detected by the antibody in tissues with higher _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ may be a degradation product of the _PROTEIN_ protein . the detection of equivalent levels of a nonspecific band in each lane by preimmune serum indicates that equal quantities of protein were loaded for each tissue sample . on the basis of the assumption of equal loading it is evident that accumulation of _PROTEIN_ protein is even higher in flowers than in leaves . therefore _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in reproductive as well as vegetative tissues consistent with a role in plant reproduction . it has previously been noted that _PROTEIN_ has two potential in frame aug translational start codons one located within intron and the other located bp downstream within exon . exon is a non coding exon whose function is currently unknown . characterization of _PROTEIN_ cdnas in leaf tissues by _PROTEIN_ and reverse transcriptase pcr indicated that was the initiating met for _PROTEIN_ in leaves because _PROTEIN_ leaf transcripts do not include intron and therefore do not contain the aug codon . however in flower tissue several products were amplified by rt pcr from total rna a small pcr product similar in size to that amplified from leaf rna and two lower abundance larger fragments . cloning and sequencing of the small flower rt pcr product confirmed that it corresponded to the leaf type rt pcr product as expected based on its similar apparent size to the leaf product . interestingly one of the higher mr products found in flower rna but not leaf rna was similar in size to the genomic pcr product indicating that it may be an unspliced transcript . several control reactions were done to demonstrate the absence of contaminating genomic dna in the rna preparations . therefore this additional rt pcr product was derived from _PROTEIN_ transcripts present in the flower rna population . cloning and sequencing of this rt pcr product confirmed that it was derived from a splice variant of the _PROTEIN_ transcript in which intron was not spliced out . because intron contains the met in frame with the downstream these data suggested that a subset of the _PROTEIN_ protein in flower tissue could be composed of a longer _PROTEIN_ variant initiated at . because this protein would be longer by only amino acids it would not be detectably different in size on immunoblots from leaf _PROTEIN_ protein . computer based predictions of the intracellular location of _PROTEIN_ differed depending on which terminal met or was used . the psort algorithm predicted a location in the chloroplast stroma for leaf _PROTEIN_ initiated at the aug codon . in contrast localization in the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ was predicted for the flower variant of _PROTEIN_ should it initiate at the aug codon . to determine the targeting properties of terminal peptides initiating at or at we fused two derivatives of these sequences to the coding sequence of _METHOD_ and determined the subcellular location of the fused _METHOD_ in transient _PROTEIN_ assays . rosette leaves from arabidopsis were bombarded with the _METHOD_ fusion constructs and then examined by laser scanning confocal microscopy to determine the subcellular location of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in cells transiently _PROTEIN_ the fused _METHOD_ from a linked plant promoter and enhancer sequences . as controls to demonstrate chloroplast and mitochondrial targeting patterns _METHOD_ was fused to the chloroplast transit peptide sequence of rubisco small subunit or to the mitochondrial targeting sequence of the _PROTEIN_ subunit . strong _METHOD_ _METHOD_ colocalizing with chloroplast _METHOD_ was detected in leaf cells bombarded with the chloroplast control construct . merging of the two _METHOD_ signals confirmed that the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ completely overlapped with the chloroplast _METHOD_ as evidenced by the yellow merged signal . in contrast the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signal was detected in punctate mitochondria in leaf cells bombarded with the mitochondrial control _METHOD_ fusion construct . as expected this mitochondrial signal did not overlap with the chlorophyll _METHOD_ . to examine the targeting properties of _PROTEIN_ initiated at we fused the aug codon followed by downstream _PROTEIN_ codons in frame with _METHOD_ . this fusion protein was exclusively targeted to chloroplasts when transiently _PROTEIN_ in leaf cells as demonstrated by the overlap of the _METHOD_ signal with the chlorophyll _METHOD_ signal . therefore proteins translated from _PROTEIN_ transcripts present in leaf tissues are likely localized to chloroplasts in agreement with the proposed function of _PROTEIN_ as a _LOCATION_ rna polymerase specificity _PROTEIN_ . to determine whether translation initiation from changed the targeting properties of _PROTEIN_ we fused the amino acids downstream of to _METHOD_ . to ensure that the targeting properties we observed were due solely to protein initiated at we mutagenized the translational initiation codon in this construct to auc encoding ile . transient _PROTEIN_ assays demonstrated that the new fusion protein had a _METHOD_ _METHOD_ pattern suggesting dual targeting because it exhibited not only the chloroplast localization pattern but also a pattern of punctuate _METHOD_ consistent with mitochondrial localization . therefore _PROTEIN_ protein in flowers could potentially be targeted not only to chloroplasts but also to mitochondria .
