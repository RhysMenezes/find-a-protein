_PROTEIN_ domain proteins are inner _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins that are part of bridging complexes linking cytoskeletal elements with the nucleoskeleton and have been shown to be conserved in non plant _METHOD_ . in this paper we report the presence of members of this family in the plant kingdom and investigate the two arabidopsis sun domain proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . our results indicate they contain the highly conserved c terminal sun domain and share similar structural features with animal and fungal sun domain proteins including a functional coiled coil domain and _LOCATION_ localization signal . both are _PROTEIN_ in various tissues with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels relatively low but upregulated in proliferating tissues . further we found _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as _METHOD_ protein fusions to localize to and show low mobility in the _LOCATION_ envelope particularly in the inm . deletion of various functional domains including the n terminus and coiled coil domain affect the localization and increase the mobility of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . finally we present evidence that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are present as homomers and heteromers in vivo and that the coiled coil domains are required for this . the study provides evidence suggesting the existence of cytoskeletal nucleoskeletal bridging complexes at the plant ne .
to identify putative sun domain homologues in plants the caenorhabditis elegans sun domain protein unc sequence was used as the query in a protein blast search in which _GENE_ and _GENE_ were identified as arabidopsis homologues of the protein . _GENE_ is amino acids long with a predicted molecular weight of kda and _GENE_ is amino acids long with a predicted molecular weight of kda . both contain the highly conserved sun domain in the c terminus and a putative coiled coil domain as well as an n terminal transmembrane domain and bipartite _LOCATION_ localization signal . in addition a putative ef hand binding domain is predicted to be present in _GENE_ . the two proteins appear to be closely related as their amino acid sequences are identical and similar . further investigations using interpro pfam and blast searches with _GENE_ and _GENE_ as queries revealed the presence of putative sun domain proteins in oryza sativa vitus vinifera physcomitrella patens and zea mays . two sun domain proteins appear to be present in each plant species apart from p. patens and all identified plant sun domain proteins are of similar size have a transmembrane domain and the conserved c terminal sun domain . a coiled coil domain bipartite nls and the ef hand binding domain are also present in some of the other plant sun domain proteins . the length and location of the domains within the protein sequences are listed in table . a comparison with well characterized animal and yeast sun domain proteins revealed that the domain layout appears to be generally conserved across the _METHOD_ . an n terminal transmembrane domain is followed by coiled coil domains and the c terminal sun domain . size appears to be a major difference with the animal sun domain proteins generally being significantly larger than the plant sun domain proteins . additional homology comparisons of _GENE_ and _GENE_ with animal and yeast sun domain proteins revealed that _GENE_ shares greater homology with animal _PROTEIN_ proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and that _GENE_ shares greater homology with animal _PROTEIN_ proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . therefore _GENE_ was renamed _PROTEIN_ and _GENE_ was renamed _PROTEIN_ . the mrnas of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were detected in adult arabidopsis leaf and inflorescence tissue as well as in arabidopsis cell suspension by rt pcr verifying that both genes are _PROTEIN_ in various tissues and cell types and are not pseudogenes . in addition relative _PROTEIN_ values based on microarray data were obtained for _PROTEIN_ from genevestigator . the gene was found to be _PROTEIN_ in different tissue types and developmental stages of arabidopsis at relatively similar levels although its _PROTEIN_ appears to be upregulated in inflorescence and root tip tissue . in comparison with reference genes ubiquitin conjugating enzyme _PROTEIN_ yellow leaf specific protein _PROTEIN_ and protein phosphatase subunit _PROTEIN_ which are _PROTEIN_ at relatively high medium and low levels respectively _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ at very low levels . upregulation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in roots of day old seedlings was reported by citation during transcriptional profiling of arabidopsis embryos and seedlings . no significant difference in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels was found during the globular heart and torpedo stages of embryonic development . polyclonal anti peptide antisera were raised to amino acids of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as these domains were found to be unique to each of the two proteins . bands of approximately kda were detected with both anti _PROTEIN_ and anti _PROTEIN_ antisera but not with the pre immune sera indicating the presence of endogenous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis leaf tissue . animal and yeast sun domain proteins have been shown to reside in the ne in particular the inm . the presence of a predicted transmembrane domain and nls in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ suggest that both proteins might localize similarly in plants . to investigate the subcellular localization of the two proteins _METHOD_ protein fusions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ transiently in tobacco leaf tissue and stably in tobacco by cells . _PROTEIN_ was observed by confocal and electron microscopy . the plant ne marker lbr _METHOD_ was used as a positive control . similar to lbr _METHOD_ both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were present at the _LOCATION_ periphery around chromatin indicative of ne localization where they co localized . additional weak _METHOD_ was also observed in either cytoplasmic puncta or the _LOCATION_ of some cells . in addition to the transient _PROTEIN_ tobacco by cells were transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . stable _PROTEIN_ of the two fusion proteins also resulted in their localization to the ne of by cells and in weak _METHOD_ labelling of _LOCATION_ and cytoplasmic puncta . ultrastructural observations of immunogold labelled tobacco leaf tissue transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were carried out to confirm the ne localization . gold labelling was primarily observed at the inm onm and periplasm with a few gold particles also decorating the _LOCATION_ . the ultrastructural observations verify the localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as _METHOD_ fusion proteins at the plant ne in particular at the inm . to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are localized specifically to the inm and to determine what domains are required for their ne localization truncation and deletion mutants of the two proteins were created fused to _METHOD_ proteins and transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaf tissue . the subcellular localization of the mutants was observed by both confocal and electron microscopy . deletion of the n terminal amino acids of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ did not affect ne localization but resulted in a significant increase of peripheral _LOCATION_ labelling . this was also observed in cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in which only the nls domain was deleted . ultrastructural observations revealed the mutant to be present _PROTEIN_ in the onm and _LOCATION_ although inm associated gold particles were also observed . the affect of the coiled coil domain on ne targeting was observed in cells _PROTEIN_ either _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in both of which the coiled coil domain had been deleted . although both mutants were present at the ne ne _METHOD_ was weak and the two mutants were _PROTEIN_ localized to bright aggregates . by lowering gain levels and laser transmission the aggregates were found to be _PROTEIN_ like structures of various sizes likely to be associated with the _LOCATION_ . these aggregates were also observed in cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . in these mutants the c terminal amino acids and amino acids of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively including the sun domain were deleted . although a small quantity of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was still present at the ne as indicated by the low ne _METHOD_ in figure _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was absent from the ne and completely localized in aggregates . ultrastructural observations of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells support the confocal observations as gold particles were not detected at the inm or onm but were detected instead at cytoplasmic membranous structures likely to be the cytoplasmic aggregates . animal and yeast sun domain proteins associate with _LOCATION_ components such as lamins and chromatin as well as other ne components such as kash domain and other sun domain proteins . binding interactions affect the mobility of the protein in the _LOCATION_ with strong binding interactions immobilizing the protein or slowing down its rate of movement . to gain an understanding of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ binding at the ne their mobility was investigated using _METHOD_ recovery after photobleaching . in addition the mobility of mutants lacking the n terminus and coiled coil domain were also investigated as these two domains are essential in animal and yeast sun domain proteins for associations with _LOCATION_ components and other sun domain proteins respectively . approximately half of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ molecules are immobile at the ne with the mobile fraction moving at and respectively making these two proteins the least mobile in the ne . interestingly when the _METHOD_ is fused to the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ their mobility significantly increases with a higher mobile fraction and diffusion rate . deletion of the n terminus and coiled coil domain also significantly increase the mobility of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is more mobile than _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . overall _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ has the highest mobile fraction with mobile and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ moves the fastest at a rate of . the observation that deletion of the coiled coil domain increases the mobility of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ suggests that this domain is involved in binding interactions that affect the mobile behaviour of the two proteins . in animal and yeast sun domain proteins the coiled coil domain facilitates oligomerization for the formation of dimers trimers and tetramers . co _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ abolished the ne localization of the non mutated protein and caused it to co localize with the mutant in aggregates raising the possibility that the two arabidopsis sun domain proteins may also interact with each other to form oligomeric complexes . to investigate this and the putative involvement of the coiled coil domain acceptor photobleaching _METHOD_ resonance energy transfer of _METHOD_ protein fusions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ at the ne was employed . the fret efficiency ef was calculated according to the method described by citation and denotes the increase of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ after bleaching _METHOD_ . as a control the change of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed when _METHOD_ was not bleached . the _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ increased significantly when it was co _PROTEIN_ with either _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and the _METHOD_ moiety was bleached . similarly the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ increased significantly after the co _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was bleached . this demonstrates the ability of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to form homomers and heteromers in vivo . however the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ did not significantly alter in comparison with the control _METHOD_ levels when _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was co _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ implying that deletion of the coiled coil domain abolishes the ability of _PROTEIN_ to form homomers .
