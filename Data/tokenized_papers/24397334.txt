the arabidopsis thaliana _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proton _PROTEIN_ genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are the two most highly _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ of an gene family and are collectively essential for embryo development . we report the translational fusion of a tandem affinity purification tag to the end of the _PROTEIN_ open reading frame in a genomic clone . stable _PROTEIN_ of tap tagged _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis rescues the embryonic lethal phenotype of endogenous double _PROTEIN_ knockdowns . western blots of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and blue native gels show enrichment of _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fractions and indicate a hexameric quaternary structure . tap tagged _PROTEIN_ rescue lines exhibited reduced vertical root growth . analysis of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and soluble proteomes identified several _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized proteins with alterred abundance in tap tagged _PROTEIN_ rescue lines compared to wild type . using affinity purification _METHOD_ _METHOD_ we uniquely identified two additional aha _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which copurified with tap tagged _PROTEIN_ . in conclusion we have generated transgenic arabidopsis lines in which a tap tagged _PROTEIN_ transgene has complemented all essential endogenous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ functions and have shown that these plants can be used to purify _PROTEIN_ protein and to identify in planta interacting proteins by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ .
our lab has previously shown that wild type _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ transgenes successfully rescue _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double knockdown embryo lethality . _PROTEIN_ we therefore wished to test whether an _PROTEIN_ transgene fused to a tandem affinity purification tag could also rescue embryonic lethality . a tap tag construct optimized for use in plants containing two tandem protein a domains separated from a calmodulin binding protein domain by a tev protease site was ligated to the end of a genomic _PROTEIN_ open reading frame _PROTEIN_ . arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were transformed with the ntapi clone via agrobacterium mediated floral dip and successful transformation events were selected on hygromycin media . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants were allowed to self and pcr genotyping of the population identified _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double knockdown plants carrying the ntapi transgene . we recovered two independent rescue lines _PROTEIN_ ntapi . a band of approximately kda was detected in western blots from denaturing _PROTEIN_ protein gels of ntapi microsomal fractions probed for protein a . following two phase partitioning the majority of protein a staining enriches in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ phase . in addition to the major band between the and kda markers we commonly observe the slightly higher and smaller kda bands on western blots . smaller bands may be due to partial proteolysis of the c terminal regulatory domain whereas larger bands may be due to alterred migration resulting from bound lipid or detergent molecules . previous studies of the nicotiana plumbaginifolia _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proton pump _PROTEIN_ indicate that the protein is present in the _LOCATION_ as hexameric complexes especially after activation by fusicoccin and subsequent protein binding . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to determine the molecular weight of nondenatured ntapi _PROTEIN_ purified _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were run on blue native gels and probed with rabbit anti cbp antibody . we observed two bands migrating close to the and kda markers . proteins may migrate higher than expected in blue native gels based on detergents and dyes used or bound lipids thus these bands likely correspond to dimeric and hexameric complexes observed previously . _PROTEIN_ detection of ntapi _PROTEIN_ in total microsomes _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and intracellular _LOCATION_ . size markers are in kda . upper panel is _METHOD_ stained and lower panel is a western blot probed with hrp conjugated rabbit anti goat igg . three _METHOD_ of ntapi or wild type _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein was run on blue native gels . proteins were transferred to _LOCATION_ and probed with rabbit anti cbp antibodies . the efficiency of _PROTEIN_ double knockdown rescue by ntapi was assessed by comparing the genotypes of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ntapi progeny to the ratios expected on the basis of mendelian segregation for either a single or two unlinked insertional events _PROTEIN_ . the presence of multiple insertions and complex transgenic loci following agrobacterium mediated transformation is common . progeny ratios differed significantly from both expected scenarios based on chi squared analysis but more closely resembled a scenario involving two unlinked transgene insertional events . a reduction in the number of rescued progeny from the expected number was observed and could be due to altered _PROTEIN_ translation trafficking or biochemical activity of the fusion protein . a similar segregation analysis of ntapi progeny was not performed because the genotype of the transformed seedling was _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . number of plants observed by pcr genotyping . number of plants expected by mendelian segregation with a single transgene insertion . number of plants expected by mendelian segregation of two unliked transgene insertional events . result of chi squared goodness of fit tests between observed and expected genotypes using degrees of freedom . when grown vertically on standard half strength m s with sucrose nutrient media we observed approximately reduced root length in ntapi plants compared to wild type or _PROTEIN_ double knockdown mutants rescued with a wild type _PROTEIN_ transgene . we looked for additional growth changes such as the time to first bolting and plant growth in soil but we did not observe readily apparent differences . work in our lab has previously shown that _PROTEIN_ single knockdown mutants exhibit root growth phenotypes when seedlings are grown under stress conditions that alter or rely on the proton motive force . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to determine effects of the tap tagged _PROTEIN_ protein on the proton motive force we grew ntapi plants in the presence of gentamicin and lithium chloride . under these conditions _PROTEIN_ knockdowns show enhanced root growth compared to wild type plants because of the reduced proton motive force that energizes the reduced uptake of these toxic compounds . ntapi lines show similar root growth phenotypes to _PROTEIN_ single knockdowns rescued with a transgene . growth of ntapi plants . vertical root growth of plants on half strength m s with sucrose media was measured at and days . bars indicate standard _LOCATION_ and two tailed two sample student t tests were used to determine statistical difference . sixteen seedling of each genotype were transferred to soil and monitored visually for bloting . representative experiment shown . vegetative growth of three representative plants for each genotype at days . vertical root growth of day old wild type ntapi and ntapi seedlings transferred to stress media for days . bars indicate standard _LOCATION_ and student t tests were performed as above . vertical root growth of day old wild type ntapi and seedlings transferred to stress media for days . with the ultimate goal of using ntapi plants for the in planta physiological investigation of _PROTEIN_ we wished to establish how closely transgenic lines resembled wild type plants beyond merely visible phenotypes . to this end we compared the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and soluble proteomes of ntapi plants to wild type and rescue lines using a metabolically labeled _METHOD_ _METHOD_ approach to determine whether _PROTEIN_ ntapi _PROTEIN_ had proteomic consequences . equal wet weights of seedlings grown in natural abundance and isotopically heavy nitrogen liquid media were mixed prior to protein extraction . subsequent downstream sample processing and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis was identical for paired tissues and the relative abundance of a peptide from the original tissue can be determined by calculating the ratio of peptide intensity . a ratio of indicates no difference in peptide abundance between metabolically labeled tissue pairs a ratio greater than indicates increased peptide abundance from grown tissue compared to grown tissue and a ratio less than indicates _PROTEIN_ peptide abundance in grown tissue we generated and reciprocal tissue pairs of liquid grown day old wild type/wild type wild and wild type/ntapi plants and performed biological duplicates for each experimental pair . proteomic analysis of both soluble and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteomes was performed . the number of unique peptides and proteins identified by tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ from each metabolically labeled tissue pair is summarized in . approximately half of the protein identifications in all samples were based on a single peptide and were discarded from further analysis . for proteins identified by more than one peptide peptide ratios were averaged to achieve a single protein ratio . protein ratios for _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and soluble fractions were plotted as the ratios from to reciprocal genotype pairs . reciprocal _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein ratios in metabolically labeled tissue pairs . wild type wild type _PROTEIN_ rescued and ntapi rescued plants were grown in natural abudance and heavy isotope nitrogen media . equal fresh weights of wild type/wild type wild and wild type/ntapi genotype pairs from two biologically replicated experiments were mixed prior to homogenization sample processing and _METHOD_ analysis . protein ratios were calculated by averaging median normalized peptide ratios determined by census with a minimum mascot score of . calculated protein ratios for reciprocally labeled tissue pairs were plotted for proteins identified by two or more peptides in both samples . the number of proteins showing reciprocal ratios of and in each sample are indicated . reciprocal soluble protein ratios in metabolically labeled tissue pairs . wild type wild type _PROTEIN_ rescued and ntapi rescued plants were grown in natural abudance and heavy isotope nitrogen media . equal fresh weights of wild type/wild type wild and wild type/ntapi genotype pairs from two biologically replicated experiments were mixed prior to homogenization sample processing and _METHOD_ analysis . protein ratios were calculated by averaging median normalized peptide ratios determined by census with a minimum mascot score of . protein ratios for reciprocally labeled tissue pairs were plotted for proteins identified by two or more peptides in both samples . the number of proteins showing reciprcal ratios of and in each sample are indicated . following manual verification of proteins showing and reciprocal ratios of or no proteins met all of the required criteria in type and reciprocal _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or soluble protein fractions . in wild tissue pairs only _PROTEIN_ itself showed statistically significant and reciprocal abundance changes in both biological replicates _PROTEIN_ . despite the reduced levels of _PROTEIN_ protein at the _LOCATION_ rescue lines show no observable phenotypes under standard laboratory growth conditions . in wild type/ntapi tissue pairs we identified nine _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins that were differentially abundant in all three reciprocal experiments with at least a abundance change in one experiment _PROTEIN_ . the majority of proteins identified show _PROTEIN_ abundance in ntapi seedlings compared to wild type but two the phosphate transporter _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ itself show increased abundance . the known cellular roles of identified proteins include _LOCATION_ transport _PROTEIN_ cell wall structure _PROTEIN_ vesicle trafficking _PROTEIN_ and microtubule structure and organization . the number of unique peptides whose ratios were averaged to calculate the total protein ratio are indicated in parentheses . two sample two tailed student t tests were used to determine statistical significance of reciprocal protein ratios if three or more unique peptides were detected in each sample . the number of unique peptides whose ratios were averaged to calculate the total protein ratio are indicated in parentheses . two sample two tailed student t tests were used to determine statistical significance of reciprocal protein ratios if three or more unique peptides were detected in each sample . a third experiment was performed comparing ntapi and wildtype plants to distinguish between effects specific to ntapi _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ versus transformation artifacts . with the goal of using ntapi plants to facilitate efficient isoform specific purification of _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis tissue we investigated the ability to specifically purify ntapi _PROTEIN_ with igg purification resin . we developed a modified tandem affinity purification protocol to purify ntapi _PROTEIN_ using only the first affinity purification step to limit the possibility of losing protein interactors with increased sample handling . _PROTEIN_ purification of ntapi _PROTEIN_ from _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fractions by igg resin is demonstrated by western blot in figure . including _PROTEIN_ in the igg resin washing buffer _PROTEIN_ nonspecifically bound proteins while retaining high ntapi _PROTEIN_ antibody reactivity in eluted fractions . using normalized spectral counts as a relative quantification of the abundance of ntapi _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ and purified samples the protein enrichment from upper phase fractions by igg resin is approximately fold under mild washing conditions _PROTEIN_ . addition of mm nacl further reduces _METHOD_ identification of contaminating proteins but also results in loss of ntapi _PROTEIN_ staining in western blots of tev eluted fractions . we therefore routinely use washing conditions containing _PROTEIN_ with no additional salts for reducing background protein contamination while retaining specifically bound ntapi _PROTEIN_ . purification of ntapi _PROTEIN_ visulized by western blot . one hundred _METHOD_ of solubilized _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein was incubated with igg purification resin washed three times with _PROTEIN_ in resuspension buffer followed by three times with actev and eluted overnight with actev protease . eluted proteins were acetone precipitated and resuspended directly in laemmli sample buffer with reducing agent . one microgram of nonplasma _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ wild type or ntapi protein and half of tev eluted proteins were loaded on nupage gels . the left panel is silver stained for total protein and the right panel is a western blot probed with rabbit anti cbp followed by li _PROTEIN_ irdye goat anti rabbit antibody . size marker values are in kda . spectral counts of a representative sample as determined by number of assigned spectra in scaffold . normalized spectral abundance _PROTEIN_ calculated according to the method of zhang et al . enrichment of ntapi _PROTEIN_ from microsomal samples as determined by increasing nsaf values . twice with volume once with volume _PROTEIN_ . three times with volume _PROTEIN_ mm nacl . after establishing specific igg purification of ntapi _PROTEIN_ we pursued the identification of ntapi _PROTEIN_ copurifying proteins using an affinity purification _METHOD_ _METHOD_ approach . ntapi and wild type plants were grown in and liquid media and combined prior to homogenization as described previously . more than three technical purification replicates were performed on type and reciprocal tissue pairs . eluted proteins were subjected to tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis and proteins showing reciprocal ratios deviating from between wild type and ntapi seedlings were subjected to manual analysis . four proteins showed increased purification from ntapi plants compared to wild type including two additional aha _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the enrichment of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from ntapi versus wild type protein extracts was validated by searching the raw data for peaks corresponding to unique peptides from each isoform . because of the high degree of sequence identity between _METHOD_ many other aha peptides were discarded from our analysis however a list of all identified aha peptides and their ratios are included in the . peptides unique to other aha _METHOD_ enrich with ntapi _PROTEIN_ after tap tag mediated purification . metabolically labeled type and reciprocal _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ pairs were incubated with igg resin washed and eluted overnight with tev protease . the raw data was inspected manually for peaks corresponding to the indicated unique peptides from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . peptides were blasted agains the database to determine uniqueness . peptide ratios for igg purified tev eluted proteins from wt metabolically labeled liquid grown tissue pairs . peptide ratios for igg purified tev eluted proteins from reciprocally labeled tissue pairs . peptide intensity from grown tissue was too low for detection in raw data by mascot set up in search mode . because of the autoinhibited state of aha proteins _PROTEIN_ we wished to investigate whether treatment in vivo with compounds known or hypothesized to cause aha activation would effect identification of ntapi _PROTEIN_ copurifying proteins . the fungal phytotoxin fusicoccin binds to and stabilizes the aha phosphorylated c terminus and protein complex causing permanent activation of the pump . _PROTEIN_ we hypothesized that treating liquid grown seedlings with fc would increase _METHOD_ _METHOD_ identification of proteins in igg purified eluates which we failed to identify in nonelicited copurification experiments . nine day old ntapi liquid grown fc and reciprocally treated pairs were subjected to combined homogenization purification and _METHOD_ analysis as previously described . treatment of seedlings with fc for min increased purification of _PROTEIN_ and several protein _METHOD_ including _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . auxin also regulates _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proton pump activity by phosphorylation although the protein kinases and/or phosphotases responsible have not been identified . _PROTEIN_ additionally the inhibitory effect of auxin on root growth is well established and likely involves regulation of proton pump activity . _PROTEIN_ when seedlings were treated with indole acetic acid for min we observed _PROTEIN_ copurification of the protein kinase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . liquid grown ntapi seedlings seedlings treated seedlings mock treated . reciprocal experiment seedlings mock treated seedlings treated . fusicoccin treatment for min . indole acetic acid treatment for min . number of unique peptides included in protein ratio average are indicated in parentheses . statistical significance is based on two sample two tailed student s t test
