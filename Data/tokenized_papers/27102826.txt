plants transport photoassimilates from source organs to sink tissues through the phloem translocation pathway . in the transport phloem sugars that escape from the sieve tubes are released into the apoplasmic space between the sieve element/companion cell complex _PROTEIN_ and phloem parenchyma cells _PROTEIN_ during the process of long distance transport . the competition for sugar acquisition between _PROTEIN_ and adjoining _PROTEIN_ is mediated by _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ translocators . _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ protein is localized in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and gus analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in the stele of roots and veins of leaves and flowers . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis increases plant size and accumulates more _PROTEIN_ and fructose . by contrast knock down of _PROTEIN_ by rna interference leads to small plant size reduction in _PROTEIN_ and fructose contents chlorosis in the leaf vein network and reduction in chlorophyll content in leaves . yeast assays demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ is able to complement both fructose and _PROTEIN_ transport deficiency . transgenic plants of _PROTEIN_ overexpression exhibit higher freezing tolerance and support more growth of bacterium pseudomonas syringae pv . phaseolicola . we conclude that _PROTEIN_ plays an important role in mediating sugar transport in axial tissues during plant growth and development .
previous studies indicated that sweet genes are genetically redundant thus single knockout mutants fail to show a noticeable phenotype . to investigate the physiological function of _PROTEIN_ we generated _PROTEIN_ knock down and overexpression transgenic plants . in total out of positive rnai transgenic plants showed reduced amounts of _PROTEIN_ mrna and leaf chlorosis and _PROTEIN_ overexpression lines were obtained . homologous transgenic plants and with single t dna insertion respectively were chosen for further analyses . we observed that compared to wild type col plants both lines and transgenic plants showed altered growth phenotypes . under normal growth conditions the seedlings of displayed yellow cotyledons whereas seedlings were as green as the wild type . at the _PROTEIN_ stages of growth mature leaves of showed chlorosis along the vein network and were green in the interveinal regions . generally the plant size of was smaller than that of wild type col and plants were larger than wild type col . furthermore the leaf size of was smaller than that of wild type col by contrast plants had larger leaf size than wild type plants . the different plant sizes of these three plants were also pinpointed by _METHOD_ accumulation . the week old plants of and col grown in soil under the normal conditions were used for _METHOD_ assessment . the dry _METHOD_ of col plants was significantly different to that of and plants in that col plants showed a dry _METHOD_ of mg per square centimeter whereas and exhibited mg and mg dry _METHOD_ respectively . in addition the fresh _METHOD_ of these three types of plants were also calculated and showed difference . since and transgenic plants displayed phenotypic alterations we used quantitative rt pcr to investigate the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ in these two lines and other rnai and oe lines . rna interference reduced _PROTEIN_ level in to half of the wild type _PROTEIN_ level whereas overexpression resulted in a fold increase in _PROTEIN_ level in . overexpression and knock down of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ led to developmental alterations observed as early as in the seedling stage in which seedlings showed smaller size and chlorosis in cotyledon whereas displayed larger cotyledon and longer hypocotyl . to study the function of _PROTEIN_ in detail a homologous knockout mutant _PROTEIN_ with t dna insertion in the sixth exon was obtained the _PROTEIN_ mutant did not show obvious altered phenotype when compared to the wild type col which is consistent with the findings of chong et al. . analysis of rt pcr showed there is no _PROTEIN_ mrna in _PROTEIN_ mutant . the phenotypic difference between _PROTEIN_ mutant and transgenic line intrigued us to postulate that the phenotypic inconsistency might be caused by the different _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mutant and line . to this end we crossed _PROTEIN_ mutant with wild type col as expected the cotyledons of seedlings from this cross showed chlorosis which resembled the phenotype of seedlings . furthermore in another cross of and col in which col was used as pollen donor the seedlings from this cross exhibited green cotyledons rescuing phenotype to the wild type . at _PROTEIN_ stages of plant growth the mature leaves of s from the cross of _PROTEIN_ and col showed chlorosis phenotype similar to that of and leaves from the cross of and col were as green as the wild type plants . we used qrt pcr to investigate the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ in these s and the results indicated that the _PROTEIN_ level _PROTEIN_ in s from the cross of _PROTEIN_ and col was reduced to half of the wild type _PROTEIN_ level in col . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the s of col cross was about of that of the wild type plants . these results indicate that there is a dosage effect on the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ and the amount of _PROTEIN_ mrna is critical to plant phenotype . in addition we also crossed line and _PROTEIN_ mutant with plants respectively using as pollen donor all s from these two crosses showed green cotyledons resembling the phenotype of . we examined the _PROTEIN_ levels of other atsweet genes in col and _PROTEIN_ plants among six genes tested four of them _PROTEIN_ showed significant _PROTEIN_ increase in _PROTEIN_ plants and all six genes did not show _PROTEIN_ difference between col and plants . leaf chlorosis may result from changes in chlorophyll content . we measured the chlorophyll contents in and _PROTEIN_ mutant . down regulation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in reduced chlorophyll a/b contents by contrast overexpression of _PROTEIN_ in increased chlorophyll a/b contents while _PROTEIN_ mutant and wild type col did not show difference in chlorophyll a/b contents . biosynthesis of chlorophyll involves many steps . glutamate semialdehyde aminotransferase _PROTEIN_ catalyzes the last step in the conversion of glutamate to aminolevulinate which is an important intermediate molecule for chlorophyll biosynthesis . we investigated the _PROTEIN_ levels of two gsa _PROTEIN_ genes in _PROTEIN_ transgenic _PROTEIN_ mutant and wild type plants qrt pcr analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ levels of gsa _PROTEIN_ and gsa _PROTEIN_ were reduced in and increased in when compared to their _PROTEIN_ in col there was no significant difference in the _PROTEIN_ of these two genes between _PROTEIN_ and col . taken together these results indicate that variations on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ result in different phenotypic alterations . phenotypes of yellow cotyledon and chlorosis in mature leaves are related to a specific _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ level which equals to half level of _PROTEIN_ in the wild type col . however null _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ does not cause obvious phenotypic change . suppression of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in leads to reductions in the _PROTEIN_ levels of gsa _PROTEIN_ genes and _PROTEIN_ in chlorophyll contents which consequently result in chlorosis in leaves . sweets are able to transport sugars . phenotypic alterations in and may result from different sugar contents . when grown in soil under normal conditions plants accumulated significantly less _PROTEIN_ and fructose in leaves than wild type plants whereas accumulated significantly more _PROTEIN_ and fructose than wild type plants indicating that _PROTEIN_ is able to import both _PROTEIN_ and fructose . however _PROTEIN_ mutant and wild type plants did not show significant difference in _PROTEIN_ and fructose contents . to further confirm the capability that _PROTEIN_ is able to transport _PROTEIN_ and fructose we performed a yeast complementation assay . the results showed that _PROTEIN_ complemented the _PROTEIN_ and fructose uptake deficiency of the yeast strain . next we monitored the germination efficiency and seedling growth of col and on half strength _METHOD_ _METHOD_ media supplemented with fructose _PROTEIN_ and sucrose respectively.after day of germination on _METHOD_ media without sugar developed faster than col whereas and col plants showed similar germination efficiency . at the following three days all three lines showed almost the same germination rate . addition of sucrose to media provoked an increase in germination efficiency for all three lines at dag . at dag seeds from all three lines already completed this first developmental phase and reached germination rate . both _PROTEIN_ and fructose inhibited germination efficiency of all three lines at dag fructose showed more severe inhibition than _PROTEIN_ . however at dag fructose had less inhibition efficiency than _PROTEIN_ in this case was much less sensitive to both _PROTEIN_ and fructose than and col . at dag fructose and _PROTEIN_ did not show much difference in inhibition efficiency although the inhibition still existed and at dag seeds of all three lines reached germination rate . the growth of seedlings from _PROTEIN_ and col on _METHOD_ supplemented with different concentrations of fructose or _PROTEIN_ was observed . compared to the seedlings grown in soil addition of fructose did not have much effect on seedling growth except that it rescued the yellow cotyledons of seedlings . by contrast addition of _PROTEIN_ not only rescued the yellow cotyledons of but also suppressed the growth of . increase in concentration of fructose and _PROTEIN_ aggravated the inhibitory effect on the growth of seedlings . addition of fructose severely inhibited the growth of seedlings as shown in seedlings showed small and yellow cotyledons _PROTEIN_ and white hypocotyls and very short roots . addition of _PROTEIN_ also suppressed the growth of seedlings but the inhibitory effect of _PROTEIN_ is different to that of fructose . seedlings grown on the media supplemented with _PROTEIN_ showed purple and small cotyledons and shortened hypocotyls . the responses of seedlings to different concentrations of _PROTEIN_ and fructose were not due to high osmotic effects because all seedlings grew similarly on and sorbitol agar media with _METHOD_ salts respectively . aba was reported to play roles in sugar mediated signal transduction . we analyzed the responses of these four types of seedlings to aba treatment . col and _PROTEIN_ seedlings displayed developmental arrest at a level of aba and seedlings exhibited severely stressed phenotype whereas seedlings did not show too much growth inhibition in the presence of aba . a high level of aba eventually suppressed the growth of seedlings . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ facilitated fructose and _PROTEIN_ import may enhance tolerance to exogenous aba stress . starch is synthesized and stored in the mature leaves during the day and broken down to sugars during the night . _PROTEIN_ and have been shown to export sucrose and are responsible for phloem loading . to explore the possible role of _PROTEIN_ in these processes we examined the starch accumulation and degradation in _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants starch staining showed that there is no difference in starch degradation among and col at the end of night . accumulated a little less _PROTEIN_ than and col at the end of light which may be caused by the lower chlorophyll content . accumulation of high levels of soluble sugars in the cold is part of a complex metabolic reprogramming in plants which is expected to help tolerate low temperatures . thus we were interested in knowing whether changes in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ had effects on freezing tolerance . the week old plants of col and were treated under freezing temperature for hours leaves from three types of plants were detached to quantify the release of electrolytes which is an indicator for the amount of destroyed cells . under normal conditions the relative electrical conductivities of leaves from these three types of plants were not different but under freezing conditions and showed significantly higher and lower relative electrical conductivities than the wild type plants respectively indicating that higher concentration of _PROTEIN_ and/or fructose can protect plant cells from being damaged under freezing condition . increase in accumulation of compatible solutes such as _PROTEIN_ and fructose can improve drought tolerance in plants . the week old plants of and col grown in soil were withheld water for days after drought treatment plants showed drought stressed phenotypes of chlorosis and purple leaves and col plants were also stressed but to a less extent suggesting that _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ level reduces drought tolerance in plants . to investigate the potential role of _PROTEIN_ in bacterial disease resistance we monitored the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ in col leaves after inoculation with nonhost bacterium pseudomonas syringae pv . phaseolicola . mrna levels of _PROTEIN_ were highly induced by psph infection at and hours after inoculation . furthermore psph bacterial growth was measured in col and plants days following inoculation . bacterial population was significantly increased in when compared to col by contrast transgenic plants supported much less nonhost bacterial growth . these results suggest that increase in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ leads to being more susceptible to the nonhost bacterial infection . previous reports indicated that the _PROTEIN_ levels of most sweet genes appear to be very low . quantitative rt pcr analysis revealed that _PROTEIN_ gene was _PROTEIN_ in many tissues except the siliques during plant development . to further investigate the _PROTEIN_ profile of _PROTEIN_ gene we generated transgenic reporter plants _PROTEIN_ gus gene under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter . analysis of the reporter plants revealed _PROTEIN_ promoter activity in different tissues during plant development . in day old transgenic seedlings gus activity was _PROTEIN_ detected in cotyledons and roots . however a closer view of gus activity in roots showed that gus staining was _PROTEIN_ observed in the stele of roots but not in the cortex and root tips . in young transgenic plants gus activity was also detected in young rosette leaves but _PROTEIN_ restricted to the vein network including minor and major veins . at flowering stage gus activity was _PROTEIN_ detected in mature flowers and very low gus activity was detected in young flower buds . in mature flowers gus activity was largely observed along the vein network of _PROTEIN_ and in the anther filaments . by contrast the anthers and pistil did not show gus activity . cross sections of mature flowers histochemically stained for gus activity further demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ accumulated in the _PROTEIN_ and anther filaments but not in the pistil of flowers . furthermore gus activity was not detected in seeds and siliques . previous reports showed that different atsweets have different cellular localizations . the closest homolog of _PROTEIN_ in grapevine was demonstrated to encode a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein . to investigate the cellular localization of _PROTEIN_ we made a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct and transfected the isolated arabidopsis protoplasts . confocal imaging of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein indicated that _PROTEIN_ is located in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . bright field showed the intact protoplasts and the red _METHOD_ indicated the positions of chloroplasts . the merged imagine was shown in .
