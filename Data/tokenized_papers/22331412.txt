the arabidopsis resistance to pseudomonas _PROTEIN_ disease resistance protein mediates recognition of the pseudomonas syringae effector protein avrpphb . _PROTEIN_ belongs to the coiled coil nucleotide binding site leucine rich repeat family and is activated by avrpphb mediated cleavage of the protein kinase _PROTEIN_ . here we present a structure function analysis of the cc and lrr domains of _PROTEIN_ using transient _PROTEIN_ assays in nicotiana benthamiana . we found that substituting the cc domain of _PROTEIN_ for the _PROTEIN_ cc domain did not alter _PROTEIN_ specificity and only moderately reduced its ability to activate programmed cell death suggesting that the cc domain does not play a direct role in the recognition of _PROTEIN_ cleavage . analysis of an _PROTEIN_ super yellow _METHOD_ protein fusion revealed that _PROTEIN_ localizes to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . alanine substitutions of predicted myristoylation and palmitoylation residues affected _PROTEIN_ pm localization protein stability and function in an additive manner indicating that pm localization is essential to _PROTEIN_ function . the first amino acids of _PROTEIN_ were sufficient for directing super yellow _METHOD_ protein to the pm . c terminal truncations of _PROTEIN_ revealed that the first four lrr repeats are sufficient for inhibiting _PROTEIN_ autoactivation however the complete lrr domain was required for the recognition of _PROTEIN_ cleavage . substitution of the _PROTEIN_ lrr domain resulted in the autoactivation of _PROTEIN_ indicating that the lrr domain must coevolve with the nbs domain . we conclude that the _PROTEIN_ lrr domain functions to suppress _PROTEIN_ activation in the absence of _PROTEIN_ cleavage and promotes _PROTEIN_ activation in its presence .
to evaluate the role of the _PROTEIN_ cc domain in the recognition of _PROTEIN_ cleavage and induction of the hr we swapped the cc domain of _PROTEIN_ with the cc domain of _PROTEIN_ which mediates the recognition of a different p. syringae effector . based on blastp analysis the _PROTEIN_ cc domain shows the highest amino acid similarity to _PROTEIN_ among the arabidopsis r proteins of known function . this is consistent with a previous phylogenetic analysis that assigned _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to the same clade distinguished by the lack of an edvid motif found in the cc domain of most other cc nbs lrr proteins . therefore we hypothesized that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ might share a similar signaling mechanism and that the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cc domains might be functionally interchangeable . we substituted the _PROTEIN_ cc domain for the _PROTEIN_ cc domain to create a chimeric protein which we refer to as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . it has been previously shown that overexpression of the _PROTEIN_ protein by itself in n. benthamiana causes a cell death response similar to the hr response induced by _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . therefore we first tested whether the chimera could induce hr by itself . unlike _PROTEIN_ the chimera was not autoactive . the chimera also did not induce hr when coexpressed with only _PROTEIN_ or only avrpphb . however when the protein was coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ and avrpphb a typical hr was observed . hr induction required the cleavage of _PROTEIN_ by avrpphb as coexpression with _PROTEIN_ and a protease inactive mutant of avrpphb failed to initiate hr . this indicates that the _PROTEIN_ cc can functionally substitute for the _PROTEIN_ cc in n. benthamiana transient assays . however when we tested the reciprocal construct no autoactive hr inducing activity was observed indicating that these two cc domains are not fully interchangeable . we were unable to test the activation of the construct by and _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana as we found that by itself induced hr . significantly overexpression of either the _PROTEIN_ cc or the _PROTEIN_ cc domain alone was not sufficient to induce cell death even when fused to _METHOD_ to enhance protein accumulation indicating that the cc domains by _METHOD_ are not sufficient for hr activation unlike the cc domains of barley _PROTEIN_ tobacco _PROTEIN_ and arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ which have recently been reported to induce cell death in n. benthamiana when overexpressed . we next asked whether the _PROTEIN_ cc domain could substitute for the _PROTEIN_ cc domain in the context of the autoactive _PROTEIN_ mutant . the resulting chimeric protein lost the autoactivation phenotype indicating that the _PROTEIN_ cc domain is not fully functional in this context . interestingly when the chimera was coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ and avrpphb a strong hr was observed . this hr depended on _PROTEIN_ cleavage as coexpression with _PROTEIN_ and did not trigger hr . these observations indicate that substitution of the _PROTEIN_ cc domain for the _PROTEIN_ cc domain reduces the efficiency of _PROTEIN_ activation and/or signaling . they also indicate that the activation of _PROTEIN_ caused by the mutation is weaker than that triggered by _PROTEIN_ cleavage . we have previously shown that deletion of the lrr domain of _PROTEIN_ causes _PROTEIN_ to be autoactive in n. benthamiana . therefore we tested whether deletion of the lrr domain from the chimera would lead to autoactivation . like the chimera the chimeric protein was not autoactive despite substantial protein accumulation . surprisingly introduction of the mutation into the chimera restored autoactivity . therefore deletion of the lrr and the substitution have additive effects on autoactivation and neither one alone is sufficient to overcome the loss of efficiency associated with substitution of the _PROTEIN_ cc domain for the _PROTEIN_ cc domain . we have previously reported that _PROTEIN_ can be coimmunoprecipitated with the _PROTEIN_ cc domain suggesting that the cc domain may play a role in the recognition of _PROTEIN_ cleavage . we thus tested whether the _PROTEIN_ cc domain can also be coprecipitated with _PROTEIN_ . consistent with the observed function of the chimera in n. benthamiana the _PROTEIN_ cc domain did indeed coimmunoprecipitate with _PROTEIN_ . the ability of _PROTEIN_ to coimmunoprecipitate with the _PROTEIN_ cc domain suggests that the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cc domains may be indirect or alternatively that there is sufficient similarity between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cc domains for _PROTEIN_ to bind to both when transiently overexpressed . under native _PROTEIN_ levels however the _PROTEIN_ cc domain can not substitute for the _PROTEIN_ cc domain as transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ the chimera driven by the native _PROTEIN_ promoter failed to display an hr when _PROTEIN_ with p. syringae strain . this result is consistent with the observed reduction in hr observed for the chimera in the transient system and suggests that the chimera falls below a threshold required for hr induction when _PROTEIN_ under native protein levels . _PROTEIN_ contains both a predicted myristoylation motif at gly and a palmitoylation motif at cys . it also contains a gly at position that could be potentially myristoylated if gly were removed . to investigate the importance of acylation in _PROTEIN_ function we mutated the gly residues at positions and to ala _PROTEIN_ and the cys at position to ala both as separate mutations and combined . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was still able to activate hr in response to _PROTEIN_ cleavage by avrpphb when transiently overexpressed in n. benthamiana . however the _PROTEIN_ substitution nearly eliminated the autoactivity of the full length _PROTEIN_ mutant without affecting protein accumulation at h post induction . like the chimera the _PROTEIN_ construct could be activated by coexpression with _PROTEIN_ and avrpphb . these data indicate that the substitution which is believed to reduce _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis and increase the percentage of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ bound state is not equivalent to activation by _PROTEIN_ cleavage . _PROTEIN_ and behaved the same as the _PROTEIN_ derivatives with both retaining the ability to be activated by coexpression with _PROTEIN_ and avrpphb and losing autoactivity . significantly the triple substitution derivative _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was completely disabled for hr initiation even in the presence of _PROTEIN_ and avrpphb . for a more quantitative assay of the hr mediated by _PROTEIN_ acylation mutants we _PROTEIN_ each _PROTEIN_ derivative with _PROTEIN_ and avrpphb and measured electrolyte leakage at or h post dexamethasone induction . compared with the negative control of super yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ wild type _PROTEIN_ induced an obvious conductivity increase as early as h post dex induction . however the _PROTEIN_ mutation completely abolished _PROTEIN_ induced electrolyte leakage . interestingly the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant induced only a moderate conductivity increase at h post dex induction but an electrolyte leakage comparable to wild type _PROTEIN_ at h post dex induction . this is consistent with the macroscopic hr assay . taken together these results suggest that n terminal myristoylation and palmitoylation play additive and partially redundant roles in _PROTEIN_ function . a possible explanation for the functional defect of _PROTEIN_ acylation mutants is that these modifications compromise interactions of the cc domain with _PROTEIN_ and/or with the nbs domain . we tested this possibility using co ip assays but we observed no significant reduction in the ability of the cc domain containing these substitutions to coimmunoprecipitate either _PROTEIN_ or the _PROTEIN_ nbs domain . likewise the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ full length protein retained the ability to interact with _PROTEIN_ . note however that these interactions may be occurring in solution following cell lysis and do not necessarily indicate that the _PROTEIN_ derivatives colocalize with _PROTEIN_ inside the cell . the requirement for myristoylation and palmitoylation motifs in _PROTEIN_ suggests that _PROTEIN_ must localize to a _LOCATION_ to be functional . therefore we investigated the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ . a c terminal _METHOD_ fusion of _PROTEIN_ was transiently _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana and visualized by laser scanning confocal microscopy . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion induced hr when coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ and avrpphb demonstrating that the addition of a c terminal _METHOD_ tag did not impair _PROTEIN_ function . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ displayed a peripheral localization when _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana epidermal cells indicating localization to the pm . a three dimensional projection of _PROTEIN_ from a z stack showed an even distribution of _PROTEIN_ on the pm with no localization to cytoplasmic strands . in contrast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ displayed an accumulation of _METHOD_ in cytoplasmic strands but not in the _LOCATION_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ lacks a functional _LOCATION_ localization signal . cytoplasmic localization was also observed for the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ indicating that both myristoylation and palmitoylation contribute to the pm localization . the above imaging was performed at to h post dex induction . to gain more insight into the dynamics of _PROTEIN_ localization we also analyzed samples at h post dex induction . surprisingly at this time point _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ displayed a wild type like localization pattern in the majority of cells analyzed . this was manifested as both a peripheral localization in a single confocal section and pm distribution in the projection . the same pattern was also observed for _PROTEIN_ at h post dex induction . these observations indicate that modification of just one acylation site significantly reduces but does not completely abolish _PROTEIN_ localization to the pm . this partial pm localization likely accounts for the hr inducing ability of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ in the presence of _PROTEIN_ cleavage by avrpphb . although both _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were easily detected using laser scanning confocal microscopy at h post dex induction _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was not visible . this observation suggested that when not _LOCATION_ associated _PROTEIN_ protein may be destabilized and degraded . to test this we compared the relative levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ myc and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ myc proteins with wild type _PROTEIN_ myc protein at or h post dex induction . at h post induction both _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ myc and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ myc proteins accumulated to levels similar to wild type _PROTEIN_ myc protein . by h post dex induction however _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ myc levels were significantly reduced compared with wild type _PROTEIN_ myc and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ myc was nearly undetectable only a very weak band showed up after overexposure . thus the stability of _PROTEIN_ protein during transient overexpression correlates with pm localization . note that the initial signs of hr are usually apparent by h post dex treatment at a time when total protein accumulation is similar between wild type and mutant constructs . we thus infer that the reduction in hr caused by the acylation mutations is due to the reduction in pm localization rather than a reduction in protein levels . since the chimera only triggered hr when coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ and avrpphb but not by itself and the _PROTEIN_ cc domain contains a predicted palmitoylation residue but no myristoylation residue we hypothesized that the chimera might be only partially associated with the pm thus reducing signaling activity . to test this we analyzed the subcellular localization of _METHOD_ however _METHOD_ was exclusively localized to the pm indicating that the absence of autoactivity in the background can not be attributed to dissociation from the pm . to further define the pm localization signal of _PROTEIN_ we generated c terminal _METHOD_ fusions to the cc domain nbs domain and nbs lrr region of _PROTEIN_ . as expected only the cc _METHOD_ fusion localized to the pm . a projection of a cc _METHOD_ z stack revealed the presence of punctate structures in addition to a pm localization profile . similarly a _PROTEIN_ cc _METHOD_ fusion was also found to localize to the pm which is consistent with previous findings that wild type _PROTEIN_ is associated with the _LOCATION_ fraction in arabidopsis cell extracts . we next fused only the first amino acids of _PROTEIN_ to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ to test whether the predicted n terminal acylation motifs were sufficient to direct pm localization . similar to _PROTEIN_ cc _METHOD_ the _METHOD_ fusion displayed a typical pm localization pattern along with the presence of numerous punctate structures in the projection view . time lapse imaging showed that the punctate structures observed for _PROTEIN_ cc _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were highly mobile suggesting that they might be vesicle like structures . the formation of physiologically inert vesicles as a consequence of overexpression has been reported for other _LOCATION_ associated _METHOD_ fusions particularly those with an acylation motif . unlike free mcherry no intranuclear _METHOD_ was observed for the _METHOD_ fusion . pm localization of the _METHOD_ fusion depends on the acylation motifs as the triple substitution _PROTEIN_ abolished the pm localization of the _METHOD_ fusion . the association of the _METHOD_ fusion with the pm provided us with an ideal negative control for co ip experiments involving _LOCATION_ associated proteins . therefore we performed co ip analysis between an _METHOD_ myc fusion and _PROTEIN_ ha _PROTEIN_ cc ha and _PROTEIN_ nbs ha protein fusions . no co ips were detected for any of these combinations although a co ip was observed for the positive control of _PROTEIN_ cc myc and _PROTEIN_ ha demonstrating the utility of this _METHOD_ fusion as a negative control for co ip assays . a positive role for the lrr in nbs lrr protein activation has been reported for the r proteins rx and . determining whether the _PROTEIN_ lrr domain contributes positively to _PROTEIN_ activation is complicated by the finding that deletion of the entire lrr domain leads to autoactivation of _PROTEIN_ . to circumvent this problem we introduced the _PROTEIN_ mutation into the _PROTEIN_ cc nbs and cc nbs derivatives hoping that this would suppress their autoactivation phenotype . indeed both _PROTEIN_ cc nbs and _PROTEIN_ cc nbs lost the autoactivation phenotype while protein accumulation was unaffected . unlike the full length _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ coexpression of _PROTEIN_ cc nbs or _PROTEIN_ cc nbs with _PROTEIN_ and avrpphb failed to induce an hr . these observations indicate that the _PROTEIN_ lrr domain plays a positive regulatory role in _PROTEIN_ activity in addition to its known negative regulatory role in preventing _PROTEIN_ cc nbs autoactivation . to test whether the positive regulatory role of the _PROTEIN_ lrr is sequence specific we swapped the _PROTEIN_ lrr for the _PROTEIN_ lrr creating a chimera . interestingly this chimera proved to be autoactive . this observation is consistent with findings from other nbs lrr proteins which suggests that the nbs and lrr domains coevolve and that negative regulation requires precise interactions between the nbs and lrr domains . to identify the minimum _PROTEIN_ lrr region required to inhibit _PROTEIN_ autoactivation five c terminal truncation mutants of different lrr lengths were created . transient _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ cc nbs incorporating the cc nbs domain plus the first three lrrs induced a strong hr similar to the cc nbs construct lacking the entire lrr domain . however with the addition of the fourth lrr the hr was dramatically suppressed although protein accumulation was similar . there was no obvious tissue collapse in the cc nbs injected area and only some mild isolated cell death was observed . constructs with longer lrr fragments displayed similar phenotypes . consistent with the macroscopic observations electrolyte leakage measurements demonstrated a strong conductivity increase for the cc nbs construct but only moderate or mild conductivity increases for other _PROTEIN_ c terminal truncation mutants . hence the first four lrrs appear to be the minimum region required to suppress _PROTEIN_ autoactivation . because the c terminal truncation constructs with four or more lrr repeats were not autoactive we were able to test whether they could be activated by cleavage of _PROTEIN_ . none of these constructs was capable of inducing hr in the presence of _PROTEIN_ and avrpphb indicating that they are unable to recognize _PROTEIN_ cleavage . to further assess the role of different lrrs in the recognition of _PROTEIN_ cleavage we constructed a second series of mutants by introducing internal deletions of three lrrs at different sites _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . these mutants did not display an autoactive phenotype . next we tested whether these mutants were still functional in recognizing cleavage of _PROTEIN_ by avrpphb . none of these mutants induced hr in response to _PROTEIN_ cleavage although protein accumulated to levels similar to wild type _PROTEIN_ . to exclude the possibility that these mutants were actually defective in signaling rather than in _PROTEIN_ cleavage recognition the same mutations were introduced into the autoactive _PROTEIN_ mutant . all of these derivatives retained their autoactivity indicating that these internal lrr deletions compromised the recognition of _PROTEIN_ cleavage but not _PROTEIN_ signaling ability . collectively these results indicate that an intact _PROTEIN_ lrr domain is required for the recognition of _PROTEIN_ cleavage . conversely suppression of autoactivation is dependent on a minimum length of the _PROTEIN_ lrr region .
