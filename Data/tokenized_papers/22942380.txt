circadian clocks generate endogenous _METHOD_ in most _METHOD_ from cyanobacteria to humans and facilitate entrainment to environmental diurnal cycles thus conferring a fitness advantage . both transcriptional and posttranslational _METHOD_ are prominent in the basic network architecture of circadian _METHOD_ . posttranscriptional regulation including mrna processing is emerging as a critical step for clock function . however little is known about the molecular _METHOD_ linking rna metabolism to the circadian clock network . here we report that a conserved snw/ski interacting protein _PROTEIN_ domain protein _PROTEIN_ a splicing _PROTEIN_ and component of the spliceosome is involved in posttranscriptional regulation of circadian clock genes in arabidopsis thaliana . mutation in _PROTEIN_ lengthens the circadian period in a temperature sensitive manner and affects light input and the sensitivity of the clock to light resetting . _PROTEIN_ physically interacts with the spliceosomal splicing _PROTEIN_ ser/arg rich and associates with the pre mrna of clock genes such as pseudoresponse _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and is necessary for the regulation of their alternative splicing and mrna maturation . genome wide investigations reveal that _PROTEIN_ functions in regulating alternative splicing of many genes presumably through modulating recognition or cleavage of and splice donor and acceptor sites . our study addresses a fundamental question on how the mrna splicing machinery contributes to circadian clock function at a posttranscriptional level .
to find new components in the floral transition pathway we performed a genetic screen in a t dna mutagenized background for early flowering mutants . from this we isolated a recessive mutant that exhibits an early flowering phenotype under both long day _PROTEIN_ and short day photoperiod conditions which we have designated as early flowering and insensitive to _PROTEIN_ . because some mutants affecting circadian clock function exhibit a photoperiod insensitive phenotype in _METHOD_ of flowering we tested _PROTEIN_ for altered rhythmicity and observed a lengthened period of circadian leaf movement in continuous white light . we then tested the _PROTEIN_ of the circadian clock controlled _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gene encoding a light harvesting chlorophyll a/b binding protein and observed a similar long period in _PROTEIN_ under ll . thus _PROTEIN_ is necessary for circadian period determination of multiple circadian clock controlled output _METHOD_ . next we monitored the effect of _PROTEIN_ mutation on the _PROTEIN_ pattern of three core oscillator genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in both ll and continuous dark free running conditions _PROTEIN_ lengthens the period in transcription of the three oscillator genes as measured with promoter luciferase assays . the elongated period of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was further confirmed at the level of steady state mrna abundance by rna gel blot analysis and quantitative rt pcr . thus these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is critical for the function of the arabidopsis circadian clock . _PROTEIN_ was isolated through a map based cloning approach and a bp deletion was detected in _PROTEIN_ . _GENE_ previously has been identified as _PROTEIN_ on the basis of altered abiotic stress responses therefore we rename _PROTEIN_ as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ mutation did not abolish the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ transcript in _PROTEIN_ has a nucleotide deletion that results in a frame shift and is predicted to result in a truncated protein that retains the whole snw and _LOCATION_ localization sequence domains and may retain partial function . a t dna insertion allele _PROTEIN_ in which the t dna inserted into the _LOCATION_ localization sequence domain and therefore is predicted to result in a null phenotype was viable as a heterozygote but was severely dwarfed and infertile when homozygous . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is an essential gene and that _PROTEIN_ is a weak allele but _PROTEIN_ is a strong and presumably null allele . because _PROTEIN_ is inherited recessively we do not favor the alternate hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ is a neomorphic allele . _PROTEIN_ encodes a amino acid snw/skip domain protein that is phylogenetically conserved from fungi to humans and is an ortholog of _PROTEIN_ in humans _PROTEIN_ in yeast and in drosophila . the circadian clock defects in _PROTEIN_ were completely complemented by transforming _PROTEIN_ genomic dna into _PROTEIN_ plants which _METHOD_ that _PROTEIN_ is responsible for the circadian clock defects in _PROTEIN_ . we performed green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ reporter _PROTEIN_ promoter driven _PROTEIN_ and qrt pcr assays to explore the subcellular localization and the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ . the results show that _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ localized protein with a broad _PROTEIN_ pattern . not all genes associated with the circadian clock exhibit circadian control of _PROTEIN_ . we did not observe cycling abundance of _PROTEIN_ steady state mrna by rna gel blot and qrt pcr analysis . light and temperature are the most extensively studied input signals of the clock system . light/dark cycles mediate circadian entrainment through associated photoreceptors which regulate the abundance and/or activity of clock components . therefore we examined the function of _PROTEIN_ in light input to the clock . the period of circadian _METHOD_ in plants and day active animals is inversely proportional to the environmental light intensity known as aschoff s rule . we observed that _PROTEIN_ is hypersensitive to both red and blue light compared with the wild type because the mutant exhibited a steeper slope in a plot of period versus fluence rate analysis of covariance showed slopes for _PROTEIN_ to be significantly steeper than those of the wild type for both red and blue light . like many clock mutants _PROTEIN_ also showed defects in photomorphogenesis with a shorter hypocotyl in constant red or constant blue light conditions . these phenotypes were completely rescued in _PROTEIN_ complementation lines . therefore _PROTEIN_ negatively regulates the inhibition of hypocotyl elongation in response to both red and blue light . these data reveal that _PROTEIN_ plays a role in red and blue light input to the clock and in photomorphogenesis . the circadian clock is able to modulate its own sensitivity to environmental stimuli such as dawn or dusk and temperature changes . thus the ability of a given stimulus to shift the phase of the clock varies according to the time of day . to confirm the function of _PROTEIN_ in light signal transduction to the clock we developed phase transition curves _PROTEIN_ and phase response curves to pulses of red or blue light given to dark _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants by monitoring the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . we represented the prc data as _PROTEIN_ in which the new phase converted to circadian time was plotted against the ct of the light pulse . the _PROTEIN_ showed that _PROTEIN_ was more sensitive to light pulses in the _PROTEIN_ night/early morning than the wild type indicating that _PROTEIN_ is hypersensitive to both red and blue light and _PROTEIN_ negatively regulates clock sensitivity to light resetting . as can be seen in the prcs _PROTEIN_ exhibited stronger phase advances to pulses given in the subjective day and stronger phase delays to red light pulses given in the subjective night . for blue light pulses _PROTEIN_ exhibited stronger phase advances to pulses given in the subjective day and dramatically greater phase delays to pulses given in the subjective night . _METHOD_ are able to _PROTEIN_ a circadian period close to h across a broad range of physiological temperatures which is known as temperature compensation and is one of hallmarks of circadian clocks . the lengthened period phenotype of _PROTEIN_ was temperature sensitive and gradually disappeared with increasing temperature from to . the period length in _PROTEIN_ was h longer than that of the wild type at but very close to the wild type at . thus _PROTEIN_ has partially lost temperature compensation indicating that _PROTEIN_ plays a critical role in _PROTEIN_ temperature compensation of the circadian clock . it is well documented that _PROTEIN_ acts as a splicing _PROTEIN_ in both mammals and yeast . to investigate further the molecular mechanism by which _PROTEIN_ affects circadian clock function in arabidopsis we asked whether _PROTEIN_ functions as a splicing _PROTEIN_ . we first tested the ability of _PROTEIN_ to complement the yeast _PROTEIN_ mutant which is defective in cell division and exhibits temperature sensitivity of growth due to a defect in pre mrna splicing . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was able to rescue the cell division and temperature dependent growth arrest defects in _PROTEIN_ . to examine further whether _PROTEIN_ acts as a splicing _PROTEIN_ like _PROTEIN_ in yeast we introduced the plasmids _PROTEIN_ an unmutated _PROTEIN_ fusion construct or an _PROTEIN_ fusion construct containing mutations in the splice site branch point site _PROTEIN_ or the splice site region of the _PROTEIN_ intron as indicated into _PROTEIN_ . levels of pre mrna lariat exon intermediate and mature mrna are analyzed by primer extension . consistent with a previous report the splicing efficiency of unmutated _PROTEIN_ fusion template in the _PROTEIN_ appears the same as in the wild type _PROTEIN_ and the splicing efficiency is not altered by transforming _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ . however the splicing efficiency for the mutated templates including uag to gag gua to guc and _PROTEIN_ was compromised in _PROTEIN_ but was partially rescued by introducing the _PROTEIN_ gene into _PROTEIN_ . that _PROTEIN_ is able to rescue the cell division temperature sensitive and splicing efficiency defects of _PROTEIN_ in yeast indicates that _PROTEIN_ is functionally conserved and possesses splicing activity in yeast . pre mrna is spliced to generate mature mrna within a ribonucleoprotein complex termed the spliceosome . to address whether _PROTEIN_ is a component of the spliceosome in planta we employed _METHOD_ resonance energy transfer to test for colocalization and physical interaction of _PROTEIN_ with the spliceosome components and _PROTEIN_ in nicotiana benthamiana . _PROTEIN_ colocalized in _LOCATION_ speckles with the spliceosome components and _PROTEIN_ . no fret signal was detected in cells cotransformed with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and mcherry indicating that these proteins do not interact closely . however a strong fret emission was observed in _LOCATION_ speckles of cells coexpressing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mcherry proteins . the results were further confirmed by photobleaching . in agreement with the above results fret between _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mcherry was detectable before bleaching the _PROTEIN_ mcherry energy acceptor but enhanced _METHOD_ intensity of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was observed after photodestruction of _PROTEIN_ mcherry indicating energy transfer between _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mcherry . increased _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ intensity after photobleaching of the mcherry acceptor is quantified in figure . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is a component of the spliceosome in which it is closely associated with _PROTEIN_ . to investigate further the function of _PROTEIN_ in mrna metabolism we performed ultra high throughput rna sequencing analysis using a mutant carrying the strong _PROTEIN_ loss of function allele . about and million reads with an average length of bp from the wild type and _PROTEIN_ respectively were aligned to the arabidopsis reference genome . among them and million reads for the wild type and _PROTEIN_ respectively were mapped to unique loci in the genome . an additional and million reads for the wild type and _PROTEIN_ respectively were aligned to annotated exon intron junctions . compared with the wild type in _PROTEIN_ we identified novel splicing events which could be sorted into four categories intron retention alternative or splice site and exon _PROTEIN_ . although examples of both ir and es were detected the majority of the altered splicing events involved the use of alternative donor and acceptor splice sites indicating that _PROTEIN_ is probably involved in splice site recognition . we validated these observations by detecting representative ir and es novel splicing events in _PROTEIN_ through rt pcr using primers flanking them . the ir and es events sampled from each chromosome could be detected in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but not in the wild type . consensus sequences at the and are important for accurate splicing of pre mrnas in plants . although the majority of splice sites used in _PROTEIN_ conformed to consensus the frequency distribution of the nucleotides at and from the novel splicing events detected in _PROTEIN_ differed from consensus with obvious _PROTEIN_ in the frequency of both the dominant g and t at and positions of alternative donor sites and of both the a and g at and positions of alternative acceptor sites consistent with a role of _PROTEIN_ protein in and recognition or cleavage . to identify biological pathways in which _PROTEIN_ is involved we conducted gene ontology analysis of genes undergoing abnormal splicing in _PROTEIN_ mutants through the agrigo web server . the results show that _PROTEIN_ may be involved in multiple biological processes including many aspects of metabolism development and reproduction . all the categories observed were overrepresented relative to the percentage in the genome . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ directly regulates the _PROTEIN_ of clock genes through splicing we measured alternative splicing of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ by an electrophoretic approach . in _PROTEIN_ aberrantly spliced variants of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were increased compared with the wild type . to determine whether patterns of alternative splicing of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrnas are regulated by the circadian clock we further performed qrt pcr to detect the _PROTEIN_ of the multiple _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ splicing _METHOD_ . the _PROTEIN_ mutation _PROTEIN_ the accumulation of the fully spliced _PROTEIN_ isoform and increased the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ aberrantly spliced variants . similarly the accumulation of the fully spliced _PROTEIN_ isoform was _PROTEIN_ whereas the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ incompletely spliced _METHOD_ was elevated in _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type . these splicing defects in _PROTEIN_ resulted in an reduction in the peak level of _PROTEIN_ and a slight reduction in the peak level of _PROTEIN_ the only _METHOD_ capable of being translated to give functional _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins . the splicing defects also reduced the proportion of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ relative to total _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts in _PROTEIN_ . these results suggest that the _PROTEIN_ peak levels of _PROTEIN_ and to a lesser extent _PROTEIN_ and possibly the enhanced accumulation of the aberrantly spliced _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ contribute to the lengthened period phenotype which is consistent with the lengthened period seen in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ loss of function mutants . splicing of pre mrna requires recruitment to the spliceosome . therefore we asked if pre mrnas associate with _PROTEIN_ in planta using the circadian oscillator genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as examples . we took advantage of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic line in the _PROTEIN_ background and applied antibody against _METHOD_ to immunoprecipitate _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the immunoprecipitates of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were then reverse transcribed into cdna and further probed by rt pcr with primers specific to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ using no immunoprecipitation and immunoprecipitation without anti _METHOD_ antibody samples as controls . pre mrna for each of these clock genes was detected in the input and the immunoprecipitation sample from the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic line and confirmed by sequencing . the results support a role for the _PROTEIN_ containing spliceosome in splicing of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ pre mrnas . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ modulates circadian period solely through alternative splicing of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we generated double or triple mutants of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and assessed circadian rhythmicity with _PROTEIN_ luc . the periods of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants were significantly longer than those of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutants but were significantly shorter than that of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant which suggests that the _PROTEIN_ mutation partially compromises the _PROTEIN_ of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but the defect is not as severe as a complete loss of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function . this is consistent with the reduced but still detectable levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrnas . moreover there must be circadian clock targets in addition to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ because the period of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutant was significantly longer than that of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . consistent with this prediction we observed _PROTEIN_ splicing defects for several other clock genes including _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ although not obvious for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ under the same condition . we conclude that the splicing defects in other clock genes besides _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may also contribute to the elongated period or other circadian defects of _PROTEIN_ . it was observed that the splicing patterns for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the wild type are quite dissimilar from those in _PROTEIN_ determined with rna seq . we attribute this to low _PROTEIN_ in the wild type the period difference between the wild type and _PROTEIN_ resulted in sampling at the peak of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ but at the trough of _PROTEIN_ in the wild type . we initially identified _PROTEIN_ on the basis of a flowering time defect so we also assessed splicing of the transcripts of flowering time genes including _PROTEIN_ of overexpression of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ flowering locus t _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . among these genes we observed obvious splicing defects for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type suggesting that _PROTEIN_ may affect both circadian clock and flowering time through alternative splicing . loss of _PROTEIN_ function through ir would be consistent with the early flowering phenotype characteristic of _PROTEIN_ mutants although loss of _PROTEIN_ function would be expected to confer _PROTEIN_ flowering . however the abundance of the mature fully spliced transcript was not obviously reduced in _PROTEIN_ for either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ suggesting that these transcripts are unlikely to be the primary _PROTEIN_ targets of relevance for the early flowering phenotype seen in _PROTEIN_ mutants .

under h h dark conditions were harvested at zeitgeber time and to detect the association of _PROTEIN_ with the pre mrna of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . after cross linking in formaldehyde a series preimmunoprecipitation treatment and immunoprecipitation with _METHOD_ antibody the immunoprecipitation products were eluted with immunoprecipitation elution buffer . the associated rnas were
