mads domain transcription _PROTEIN_ play important roles in various developmental processes in flowering plants . members of this family play a prominent role in the transition to flowering and the specification of floral organ identity . several studies reported mrna _PROTEIN_ patterns of the genes encoding these mads domain proteins however these studies do not provide the necessary information on the temporal and spatial localisation of the proteins . we have made _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ translational fusions with the four mads domain proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and from the model plant arabidopsis thaliana and analysed the protein localisation patterns in living plant tissues by confocal laser scanning microscopy _PROTEIN_ . we unravelled the protein localisation patterns of the four mads domain proteins at a cellular and subcellular level in inflorescence and floral _METHOD_ during development of the early flower bud stages and during further differentiation of the floral organs . the protein localisation patterns revealed a few deviations from known mrna _PROTEIN_ patterns suggesting a non cell autonomous action of these _PROTEIN_ or alternative control _METHOD_ . in addition we observed a change in the subcellular localisation of _PROTEIN_ from a predominantly _LOCATION_ localisation to a more cytoplasmic localisation occurring specifically during _PROTEIN_ and stamen development . furthermore we show that the down regulation of the homeodomain transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in ovular tissues is preceded by the occurrence of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins supporting the hypothesis that both proteins together suppress _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the ovule . this approach provides a highly detailed in situ map of mads domain protein presence during early and _PROTEIN_ stages of floral development . the subcellular localisation of the transcription _PROTEIN_ in the cytoplasm as observed at certain stages during development points to _METHOD_ other than transcriptional control . together this information is essential to understand the role of these proteins in the regulatory processes that drive floral development and leads to new hypotheses .
in this study we analysed the spatio temporal protein localisation patterns of c terminally _METHOD_ tagged genomic clones of mads domain proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ during floral development hereafter referred to as _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the generated constructs were transformed to arabidopsis thaliana wild type col plants and at least four _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ stable primary transformants per construct were analysed for their protein localisation . these were found to be very similar in localisation patterns although some differences in _PROTEIN_ levels were observed . these differences in _PROTEIN_ levels may be due to differences in transgene copy numbers but they may also be caused by positional effects of the insertion of the transgene . three constructs namely _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were also introduced into their respective mutant lines . these complementation experiments showed that c terminal _METHOD_ tagged mads domain proteins are functional as the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins can rescue the mutant phenotypes of ag and mutants respectively . as the single mutant shows very subtle phenotypic alterations due to the redundancy of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct was only transformed into the wild type background . the spatio temporal protein localisation patterns described here are from representative lines homozygous for the transgene in the col wild type background . in the inflorescence meristem _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants had a very low but definite signal in the epidermal layer that was located mostly in the _LOCATION_ . during the initiation of the floral primordia and flower bud stages and this epidermal localisation pattern remained . however stage flower buds also showed a few cells in the subepidermal and inner cell layers in the centre of the floral meristem that started to have a much higher level of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal also located mostly in the _LOCATION_ . during the development towards stage flower buds this signal spread out to encompass the whole dome of the floral meristem from which the second third and fourth whorl will develop at _PROTEIN_ stages . this increasing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localisation fits with the reported mrna _PROTEIN_ pattern _PROTEIN_ where _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ starts in _PROTEIN_ stage flower buds and is largely confined to the three inner whorls of the flower primordium . however the weak but distinct epidermal presence of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the inflorescence meristem and stage flower buds has not been reported before . this signal could originate from the epidermis itself but it can not be excluded that it is the result of epidermal transport from nearby high _PROTEIN_ tissues such as the floral meristem in stage flower buds . we also observed signal in the epidermal layer of sepal primordia . during the development of the sepals the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal became weaker at the abaxial side of the sepals while the signal remained at the adaxial side . in agreement with this low level _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is occasionally detected on the adaxial side of sepals at _PROTEIN_ stages _PROTEIN_ and it was shown that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are involved in specifying adaxial sepal surface identity . confocal microscopic analysis of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localisation in inflorescence meristem and early flower bud stages . overview of an inflorescence with

and stamen initiation _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins in the future second and third whorl became both cytoplasmically and _LOCATION_ localised . at the same time the proteins in the innermost part of the floral meristem clearly remained _LOCATION_ localised . this cytoplasmic _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal in the second and third whorl could be due to higher _PROTEIN_ levels of the gene resulting in a temporary accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins in the cytoplasm waiting for transportation to the _LOCATION_ . another option could be that the appearance of new interaction partners in this region results in the cytoplasmic localisation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . for instance it is known that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ which determines _PROTEIN_ and stamen identity together with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ also starts at stage and is restricted to the same area where whorl and will develop . it would be interesting to investigate if _PROTEIN_ is also located predominantly in the cytoplasm at this point in development . another possibility could be that higher cell division rates in the area of the future second and third whorl which cause the _PROTEIN_ and stamen primordia to arise result in increased unloading of previously _LOCATION_ localised proteins into the cytoplasm . the smaller cell sizes in the area of the future second and third whorl compared to the innermost part of the floral meristem could indicate higher cell division rates . this unloading of the _LOCATION_ localised proteins into the cytoplasm during cell division may also allow the proteins to meet new partners and form new complexes in the cytoplasm for instance with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in stage flower buds the initiating _PROTEIN_ and stamen primordia revealed an epidermal layer with mostly _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ while the subepidermal and inner cell layers showed a lower _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal both cytoplasmically and _LOCATION_ localised . apparently _PROTEIN_ is less needed in the inner layers of the emerging _PROTEIN_ and stamen than in the epidermis . in the mean time the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins in the fourth whorl remained _LOCATION_ localised . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal appeared in a cluster of subepidermal and inner layer cells in very early stage flower buds at the time when the first sepal primordium started to arise . during the development of stage flower buds the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localisation enlarged to encompass the part of the floral meristem from which the third and fourth whorl will develop and this pattern remained in _PROTEIN_ stages . this corresponds well to the observed _PROTEIN_ mrna _PROTEIN_ pattern that starts in the floral meristem of stage flower buds and continues in whorl and in _PROTEIN_ stages . during all the early stages of flower bud development the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein seemed to be primarily localised in the _LOCATION_ but a substantial part of the signal was also localised in the cytoplasm . in a stage flower bud _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was present throughout all cell layers of the developing stamen primordia and in the region of whorl . confocal microscopic analysis of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_

plants exhibited a very high _METHOD_ signal throughout all cell layers . this signal was mostly located in the _LOCATION_ but also in the cytoplasm . as soon as the flower bud primordia were initiated the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal started to reduce in the subepidermal and inner cell layers while in the centre of the emerging flower buds some cells _PROTEIN_ the high level of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal . during the development of the sepals the basal part of the sepal had _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins in both epidermal and subepidermal layer whereas the apical part of the sepal had only epidermal _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . this _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was _PROTEIN_ at the abaxial side of the sepal whereas the adaxial side and the abaxial side at the tip showed a reduction in signal . in stage and flower buds the floral meristem had the highest amount of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein in the innermost part of the floral meristem while in the area of the future second and third whorl the amount gradually reduced . however in these initiating _PROTEIN_ and stamen primordia the presence of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the epidermis remained the longest . confocal microscopic analysis of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localisation in inflorescence meristem and early flower bud stages . overview of an inflorescence with the inflorescence meristem and early flower bud stages to indicated .

meristem from stage flower bud onwards but not in the intermediate flower bud stages and _PROTEIN_ . therefore the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ presence that was observed in flower bud stages and might be due to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein that remained from previous stages . the renewed _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ in stage flower buds in the centre of the floral meristem corresponds with the increased _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein accumulation in the centre of the floral meristem from stage onwards . in summary throughout the development from inflorescence meristem to floral organs it _METHOD_ that the tissues that need to remain undifferentiated such as the inflorescence and floral meristem have _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein in all cell layers . differentiating tissues however like the developing floral organs seem to loose the subepidermal and inner cell layer _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal and only retain the signal in the epidermis . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was first detected in a few cells of the epidermal and internal cell layers of the emerging flower bud primordium . from flower bud stages to the _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was found throughout all cell layers and was located predominantly in the _LOCATION_ . in flower bud stages and the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein in the sepals was most abundant in the apical tips . the signal diminished in the third and fourth whorl at this stage while the signal remained in the second whorl where the _PROTEIN_ primordia would emerge . however a few epidermal cells in the centre of the fourth whorl still had a low _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal perhaps representing the last meristematic cells in the differentiating floral meristem . this localisation pattern corresponds with the reported _PROTEIN_ mrna _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ where _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ starts in stage flower bud primordia and increases during the development of the flower bud until stage . at the end of stage the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ starts to reduce in the centre of the floral meristem as a result of the negative regulation of _PROTEIN_ protein present there . however as our _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localisation studies revealed there is a clear time lag between the termination of _PROTEIN_ mrna _PROTEIN_ in early stage flower buds and the reduction in time of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein starting in _PROTEIN_ stage flower buds . the same time lag is seen for the reduction of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal starting in stage flower buds where _PROTEIN_ mrna _PROTEIN_ is suppressed due to the presence of _PROTEIN_ protein . this negative regulation of _PROTEIN_ on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is probably also apparent in the developing sepals where eventually the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein presence is highest in the basal parts of the sepals while _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein is more abundant in the apical tips of the sepals . confocal microscopic analysis of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localisation in inflorescence meristem and early flower

well established however less is known about putative _PROTEIN_ functions of mads domain proteins in differentiating floral organs . recently a report showed that _PROTEIN_ has a _PROTEIN_ function in stamen development and it was already known that _PROTEIN_ has a _PROTEIN_ function in pistil and fruit development _PROTEIN_ . in view of this and the _PROTEIN_ that mads domain proteins were still present in differentiating floral organs we studied the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localisations during the development of the _PROTEIN_ in more detail . at stage we observed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was predominantly located in the epidermis of the emerging _PROTEIN_ primordium while _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was present throughout all cell layers . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein was hardly present at this stage of _PROTEIN_ development . around stage when _PROTEIN_ start to increase rapidly in size high _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was detected throughout all cell layers . this signal slowly reduced in time and was almost abolished in a stage _PROTEIN_ . this is in agreement with the _PROTEIN_ mrna _PROTEIN_ pattern reported for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . remarkably _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein was observed in the centre of the claw around stage where it might be involved in the vascular development of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal in a stage _PROTEIN_ was higher in the adaxial epidermis of the _PROTEIN_ than the abaxial epidermis . this difference in adaxial and abaxial patterning of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein remained until stage _PROTEIN_ although the signal gradually reduced . in a stage _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal on the adaxial side was strongest in the blade and in the middle of the claw while at the abaxial side the edges of the blade and the middle of the claw had the strongest _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal . the asymmetric accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein in the _PROTEIN_ epidermis is in contrast with the uniform _PROTEIN_ mrna _PROTEIN_ reported for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but it does resemble the epidermal _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localisation pattern that we observed in sepals suggesting that _PROTEIN_ could play a role in the adaxial/abaxial patterning of both organs . confocal microscopic analysis of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ during _PROTEIN_ development .

_PROTEIN_ claw of _PROTEIN_ . scale bars of and and scale bar of . it is well known that _PROTEIN_ has a _PROTEIN_ function in valve differentiation in the developing pistil and in fruit elongation _PROTEIN_ . in contrast much less is known about putative _PROTEIN_ functions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ during pistil development . therefore we studied the localisation patterns of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the developing pistil until flower bud stage when style valves valve margins and replum are being formed . note that in stage pistil tissue the confocal microscope laser could not reliably penetrate beyond five cell layers . we observed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is predominantly located in the two valves and the replum and to a much lesser extent in the valve margins and the basal half of the style . in the valves _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was present in the first five cell layers whereas we detected signal in the replum and the style only in the first two layers and in the valve margins only in the first layer . in a younger gynoecium this _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localisation pattern was already visible although with lower intensity but in this stage the future replum had only relatively high signal in the basal part . the presence of _PROTEIN_ in the epidermal and subepidermal layers of the replum and valve margins has not been reported before in either developing pistils or fruits _PROTEIN_ . nevertheless ful mutant fruits do not only have defects in the valve tissue but also fail to dehisce indicating defects in the replum and valve margins _PROTEIN_ . also the presence of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein in the replum does not transform the cells into valve cells whereas this was reported happening when constitutively _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the entire gynoecium . this suggests that either the replum identity is already established prior to or around stage before the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is basal apically up regulated in the replum or that for the conversion of replum to valve cells _PROTEIN_ protein needs to be present in all cell layers of the replum . the suggestion that _PROTEIN_ could be intercellularly transported from the valve tissue to the replum _PROTEIN_ is supported by our localisation data . on the other hand most studies on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ focused more specifically on fruit development therefore it could be that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the epidermal and subepidermal layers of the replum and valve margins in the developing pistil has been overlooked . confocal

part of a stage pistil with the highest signal in the valve margins and replum and lower signal in the valves . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal in all cell layers of the middle part of a stage pistil . schematic cross sections of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localisations in the ovary wall . replum stigma style valve valve margin . all scale bars . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein is most abundant in the replum and the valve margins while the valves and the style showed a much lower signal . in the replum and the valve margins _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was located in the first two cell layers whereas the style and the valves had only signal in the epidermal layer at this stage of pistil development . however in a younger gynoecium the same localisation pattern with lower intensity was found but at least three cell layers deep in the future style and two cell layers deep in the future valve margins the future replum and the future valves . therefore it _METHOD_ that during the development of the gynoecium _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ becomes restricted to the epidermal and subepidermal layers . we observed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is present throughout all cell layers of the whole pistil including the style and stigma . in a younger gynoecium the same pattern is already present . it was shown that _PROTEIN_ mrna _PROTEIN_ at early gynoecium stages is throughout the whole tissue but in contrast to our protein localisation data this _PROTEIN_ becomes restricted over time to the stigma and no or hardly any _PROTEIN_ exists in the ovary walls in a stage pistil _PROTEIN_ . the high uniform signal of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ that we observed throughout stage and stage pistils could be explained by a low turnover of the protein molecules in those tissues . we studied the spatio temporal localisation pattern of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ during ovule development in relation to the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is a homeodomain transcription _PROTEIN_ involved in meristem cell identity _PROTEIN_ in shoots and an important regulator of ovule development . it is _PROTEIN_ in the centre of the shoot apical meristem inflorescence and floral meristem and _PROTEIN_ in the developing ovule . the down regulation of _PROTEIN_ in the terminating floral meristem is thought to be regulated by _PROTEIN_ . additionally d and e type mads domain proteins like _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ might be involved in the suppression of _PROTEIN_ and the termination of the floral meristem . in ovules _PROTEIN_ is thought to be down regulated by the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ dimer combined with homeodomain transcription _PROTEIN_ . for this reason the localisation pattern of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was correlated with the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ in ovules which may reveal whether this interaction between these mads domain proteins and the _PROTEIN_ gene is tightly correlated . both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were present from the protrusion stage of ovule development stage onwards . at the beginning of stage _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was present in the whole protrusion while _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ seemed to be limited to the funiculus and the _PROTEIN_ with hardly any _METHOD_ in the nucellus . during the initiation of the inner and the outer integuments stages ii to iii the amount of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein in the nucellus increased . at the same time the initiating inner and outer integuments showed the highest _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ levels . also _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal peaked during the stages ii to iii with the highest signal in the initiating inner integument and the nucellus . after stage iii both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were clearly present in the nucellus . these spatio temporal patterns of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fit with the reported _PROTEIN_ mrna _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ mrna _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . however no _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was seen in the nucellus whereas we did see increasing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal in the nucellus . this could be the result of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transport from the developing integuments towards the nucellus . the transcriptional pwus gus reporter line showed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gradually becomes restricted to the integument primordia and the nucellus in the stages ii to iii until it was only present in the nucellus after stage iii . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ peaked in the nucellus during the stages ii to iii and afterwards diminished . therefore it _METHOD_ that this proximal distal down regulation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the different ovular tissues is preceded by increasing proximal distal _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals and only occurs in the tissues where both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were present supporting the hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are together involved in the repression of

all plants were grown at in growth chambers under a long day light regime . the construction of transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ gag _METHOD_ gful _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ was previously described _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ genomic clone has a promoter region of approximately kb upstream from the translational start the _PROTEIN_ genomic clone has a promoter region of approximately kb and the _PROTEIN_ clone has a promoter region of approximately kb . to make the translational _METHOD_ fusion construct a genomic clone fragment of _PROTEIN_ was amplified with the following two gene specific primers the forward primer _PROTEIN_ located bp upstream from the translational start and the reverse primer _PROTEIN_ lacking the stop codon at the end of the coding sequence . the amplified product was inserted into the pentr/d topo vector and after sequence controls recombined into the binary vector . arabidopsis plants were transformed with agrobacterium tumefaciens strain using the floral dip method . transformed seeds were selected on lb agar plates with hygromycin and stable transgenic lines were _PROTEIN_ afterwards . furthermore a transcriptional pwuschel gus line was used to analyse the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ in developing ovules . stable transgenic plant lines _PROTEIN_ gag _METHOD_ and gful _METHOD_ in wild type col background were crossed with the ag t dna insertion mutant line and the ful mutant _PROTEIN_ respectively while the _METHOD_ construct was directly transformed into the t dna insertion mutant line . in the progeny the presence of the wild type allele the mutant allele and the _METHOD_ tagged mads box gene construct was determined by pcr and _PROTEIN_ . for _PROTEIN_ the following primer pairs were used _PROTEIN_ wild type allele forward primer _PROTEIN_ annealing immediately after the _PROTEIN_ codon and reverse primer _PROTEIN_ located in the utr bp downstream of the _PROTEIN_ codon ag t dna mutant allele forward primer located in the utr bp upstream of the _PROTEIN_ codon and reverse primer _PROTEIN_ located on the left border of the t dna . the presence of gag _METHOD_ was determined by _PROTEIN_ in the inflorescences . for _PROTEIN_ the following primer pairs were used _PROTEIN_ wild type allele forward primer _PROTEIN_ located in the utr bp upstream of the _PROTEIN_ codon and reverse primer _PROTEIN_ in the utr bp downstream of the _PROTEIN_ codon ful mutant allele forward primer _PROTEIN_ corresponding with the inserted dse element and reverse primer _PROTEIN_ and gful _METHOD_ forward primer _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the utr bp upstream and reverse primer _PROTEIN_ bp upstream of the _PROTEIN_ codon of _METHOD_ . for _PROTEIN_ the following primer pairs were used _PROTEIN_ wild type allele forward primer _PROTEIN_ bp downstream of the _PROTEIN_ codon and reverse primer _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the utr bp downstream of the _PROTEIN_ codon _METHOD_ forward primer _PROTEIN_ and reverse primer _PROTEIN_ bp downstream of the _PROTEIN_ codon of _METHOD_ . to observe the localisation of the _METHOD_ tagged proteins in living plant tissue inflorescence material was dissected until the relevant _METHOD_ and flower buds became visible . after stage flower buds when sepals started to enclose the floral meristem it became dificult to visualise the underlying developing floral organs without dissecting the flower buds . the tissues were embedded as previously described _PROTEIN_ . the dye was used as a red counter stain for cell _LOCATION_ and added at a concentration of to the embedding mixture of agar _METHOD_ . the incubation time of the sample in the embedding mixture with was at least minutes . confocal laser scanning microscopy _PROTEIN_ of the living plant tissue was performed with a zeiss lsm inverted confocal microscope using a c apochromat lens . both _METHOD_ and the dye were excited with the nm line of an argon ion laser . the _METHOD_ emission was filtered with a nm band pass filter while the dye emission and red _METHOD_ was filtered with a nm long pass filter . the optical slices in the confocal z stacks were made as a sum of scans and were median filtered afterwards . three dimensional projections of the obtained confocal z stacks were made with the zeiss lsm image browser version and adjusted with adobe photoshop version . to analyse the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ in developing ovules inflorescences of the pwus gus line were fixed and a _PROTEIN_ assay was performed overnight at as previously described . after gus detection and chlorophyll removal the inflorescences were kept in hoyer 's solution . whole siliques of one inflorescence were put under a cover slip and observed with a nikon optiphot microscope . bright field images of the ovules were taken with a leica _PROTEIN_ digital camera using a plan dic objective .
