autophagy is an important mechanism for nonselective intracellular breakdown whereby _LOCATION_ and organelles are encapsulated in vesicles which are then engulfed and digested by lytic _LOCATION_ . in yeast this encapsulation employs a set of autophagy _PROTEIN_ proteins that direct the conjugation of two ubiquitin like protein tags _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to phosphatidylethanolamine and the _PROTEIN_ protein respectively . using an arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ mutant unable to ligate either tag we previously showed that the _PROTEIN_ conjugation system is important for survival under nitrogen limiting growth conditions . by reverse genetic analyses of the single arabidopsis gene encoding _PROTEIN_ we show here that the subpathway that _METHOD_ the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ conjugate also has an essential role in plant nutrient recycling . similar to plants missing _PROTEIN_ those missing _PROTEIN_ display early senescence and are hypersensitive to either nitrogen or _PROTEIN_ starvation which is accompanied by a more rapid loss of organellar and cytoplasmic proteins . multiple _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ could be detected immunologically in seedling extracts . their abundance was substantially elevated in both the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants caused in part by an increase in abundance of several _PROTEIN_ mrnas . using a green _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ fusion in combination with concanamycin a we also detected the accumulation of autophagic bodies inside the _LOCATION_ . this accumulation was substantially enhanced by starvation but blocked in the _PROTEIN_ background . the use of this fusion in conjunction with atg mutants now provides an important marker to track autophagic vesicles in planta .
in previous studies we and others discovered a collection of arabidopsis genes related to the yeast _PROTEIN_ group including small families that encode components of the _PROTEIN_ conjugation pathway . from an analysis of the _PROTEIN_ sequence tag and _METHOD_ parallel signature sequences databases and the dna microarray results of citation it appears that all known arabidopsis loci required for _PROTEIN_ conjugation are _PROTEIN_ . in _PROTEIN_ one or more _PROTEIN_ and transcripts were detected in all tissues examined indicating that this pathway is not restricted to a specific tissue type or developmental window . high level _PROTEIN_ was observed in floral organs including sepals _PROTEIN_ and stamens implying that these ephemeral tissues use autophagy during their rapid senescence following fertilization . comparably low level _PROTEIN_ was evident in germinating seeds suggesting that autophagic events involving _PROTEIN_ proteins do not play a major role in seed metabolism . we also observed significant differences in _PROTEIN_ among members of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ gene families implying that tissue/cell specific roles among their _METHOD_ exist . within the nine member _PROTEIN_ family _PROTEIN_ displayed the highest _PROTEIN_ level in various flower parts whereas _PROTEIN_ was highest in roots . in most cases the microarray data for the family members were supported by analysis of the est database . for example the higher _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ relative to _PROTEIN_ was paralleled by a fold higher number of cdnas in the est collection . within the _PROTEIN_ family the three highly _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ e and f had and ests respectively whereas two less _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and g were represented by eight and five ests respectively . previous studies with an arabidopsis t dna disruption mutant affecting _PROTEIN_ showed that conjugation of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ while not essential is important for survival under n deficient growth conditions . to help define the functions of the _PROTEIN_ conjugation pathway individually we searched for mutants affecting its target protein _PROTEIN_ . blastp searches of the near complete genomes of arabidopsis and rice identified single loci encoding _PROTEIN_ in both species . by analysis of genomic and full length cdna sequences the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ gene was predicted to encode a amino acid protein with and similarity to its rice s. cerevisiae drosophila melanogaster and human counterparts respectively . among the numerous conserved residues present within the _PROTEIN_ collection is a lys _PROTEIN_ identified in the yeast version as the attachment site for _PROTEIN_ . in a screen of the syngenta arabidopsis insertion library t dna insertion population in the wild type columbia background we identified two mutant alleles of _PROTEIN_ designated _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the t dna of _PROTEIN_ inserted within the fourth intron just downstream of the exon bearing the codon for lys without altering the surrounding genomic sequence . for _PROTEIN_ the t dna sequence interrupted the untranslated region nucleotides upstream of the translation start codon . basta herbicide resistance conferred by the bar gene within the t dna segregated in a pattern for both mutant alleles suggesting that each has a single insertion site . in populations of homozygous _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ plants genomic pcr with and gene specific primers confirmed the absence of an uninterrupted wild type _PROTEIN_ gene whereas pcr with a gene specific primer and a t dna left border primer showed the presence of the introduced t dna sequences . reverse transcription pcr analysis demonstrated that the t dna prevented accumulation of the normal _PROTEIN_ mrna in _PROTEIN_ seedlings . although a pcr product containing the region upstream of the t dna was generated from the mrna a product encompassing the full length transcript was not apparent . for _PROTEIN_ however rt pcr showed that _PROTEIN_ of the gene was not appreciably attenuated by the t dna . both sets of primers were able to amplify the _PROTEIN_ mrna indicating that _PROTEIN_ of the full length protein was possible . to test if the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants affected accumulation of the _PROTEIN_ protein we performed immunoblot analysis on crude extracts from homozygous seedling using antibodies generated against recombinant _PROTEIN_ . as shown in figure an abundant kd protein and a minor kd protein were detected in wild type extracts . both species _METHOD_ were absent in the extracts from _PROTEIN_ seedlings demonstrating not only that the _PROTEIN_ mutation likely represents a null allele but also that both species were derived from the _PROTEIN_ locus . the kd species was close in apparent _METHOD_ to that predicted for _PROTEIN_ whereas the kd species was close to the prediction for the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ conjugates _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . to help confirm these assignments we analyzed extracts from _PROTEIN_ seedlings in the wild type wassilewskija background that fail to accumulate the needed to conjugate _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ . here the kd species was completely absent whereas the kd species was substantially more abundant thus strongly supporting the proposal that the kd protein is the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ conjugate while the kd form is free _PROTEIN_ . consistent with rt pcr analyses showing that a full length _PROTEIN_ transcript could be generated from the _PROTEIN_ allele we detected the corresponding _PROTEIN_ protein in homozygous _PROTEIN_ seedlings . in contrast to wild type seedlings both free _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ conjugate were present in near equal amounts indicating that the t dna may misregulate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . since the _PROTEIN_ mutation did not affect the level of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ conjugate and was phenotypically silent it was not characterized further . given the possibility that loss of _PROTEIN_ affects _PROTEIN_ conjugation in arabidopsis as it does in yeast we prepared antibodies against recombinant _PROTEIN_ to assay this protein family . this antibody also readily identified recombinant _PROTEIN_ the most dissimilar isoform in this highly conserved family demonstrating that it should recognize all nine members of the _PROTEIN_ family . in both wild type col and ws seedling extracts we detected several _PROTEIN_ proteins of to kd indicating that multiple _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulate . their steady state levels were substantially higher in the homozygous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ backgrounds but not in the _PROTEIN_ background suggesting that defects in the entire _PROTEIN_ conjugation system and that for _PROTEIN_ specifically either enhance the synthesis of _PROTEIN_ proteins or interfere with their breakdown . similar to arabidopsis t dna mutants disrupting _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ homozygous _PROTEIN_ seedlings germinated and developed normally and flowered and set seed at the same rate as wild type plants under a long day photoperiod . however under a short day photoperiod the _PROTEIN_ plants like _PROTEIN_ plants grew slower resulting in smaller plants flowered _PROTEIN_ than wild type with reduced fecundity and showed enhanced senescence of rosette leaves . prior growth studies showed that plants missing _PROTEIN_ and thus unable to conjugate both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are hypersensitive to n deficient growth conditions . a similar response was observed for homozygous _PROTEIN_ seedlings when grown under a long day photoperiod on a suc containing medium without n. following d on n deficient medium the _PROTEIN_ seedlings like _PROTEIN_ seedlings displayed enhanced chlorosis of the cotyledons and reduced true leaf formation as compared to wild type seedlings . enhanced chlorosis was also evident for detached leaves and intact plants grown in n deficient liquid medium . when the plants were exposed to various lengths of n starvation and then returned to n rich medium both the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants experienced a dramatic drop in the percentage of seedlings that recovered . while nearly of wild type resumed growth after d on n deficient medium only approximately of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants recovered . to test whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants also displayed slower growth and accelerated senescence under c limiting conditions we developed an assay to test the effects of c starvation specifically . seedlings were first grown for weeks on n/c rich agar medium and transferred to soil for more weeks in short days to _PROTEIN_ an adequate supply of photosynthate . the seedlings were then placed in darkness for extended periods before a week recovery under the short day photoperiod . previous studies showed that such prolonged darkness is a facile way to activate _LOCATION_ specific proteolysis in corn possibly via an autophagic mechanism and to accentuate autophagic defects in arabidopsis . as can be seen in figure both the wild type ws and col parents could tolerate this dark incubation for up to d and then resume growth in the light . at d all of the col plants and most of the ws plants died thus defining an upper limit for tolerance to extended darkness . when the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings were tested similarly a striking hypersensitivity to darkness was apparent . both mutants barely recovered after d in the dark whereas none survived after d . to examine the effects of c starvation induced by darkness at the molecular level we collected wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants immediately after the dark treatment and examined both protein and mrna levels . plants left for progressively longer times in the dark became severely chlorotic and flaccid a condition that was more pronounced in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . consistent with these _METHOD_ the _PROTEIN_ mutant lost protein faster than its respective col wild type during the dark treatment as seen by both silver staining of total protein and by immunoblot analyses for specific polypeptides . spectrophotometric analysis showed that chlorophyll was also degraded at an accelerated rate in the mutants . despite the faster rate the complement of proteins degraded in the _PROTEIN_ background was indistinguishable from wild type with little evidence that specific proteins were selectively retained or lost in the mutant . this comparable breakdown was supported by immunoblot analyses with a battery of antibodies against _LOCATION_ and organellar proteins . as can be seen in figure rubisco and magnesium protoporphyrin chelatase which are markers for chloroplasts a mitochondrial marker _PROTEIN_ and a _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ all disappeared similarly during the dark treatment with their loss accelerated in the _PROTEIN_ seedlings . with respect to the _PROTEIN_ conjugation pathways we found that the levels of _PROTEIN_ also _PROTEIN_ faster in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background . while the free kd form of _PROTEIN_ was barely detectable in wild type plants before the dark treatment this species became more abundant following prolonged incubation in the dark . not surprisingly this increase in free _PROTEIN_ in the col plants coincided with the drop in _PROTEIN_ which is necessary for its conjugation . unlike _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and other seedling proteins the levels of the _PROTEIN_ protein family in wild type seedlings did not drop during dark induced c starvation but increased slightly despite the substantial loss of most other polypeptides . similar to the observations in figure the levels of the _PROTEIN_ proteins were substantially higher in the homozygous _PROTEIN_ background with several new species becoming predominant . most of these species peaked in abundance between to d of darkness and declined thereafter . after more extended dark treatments two lower molecular _METHOD_ species of approximately kd appeared . although it remains possible that these species are _PROTEIN_ pe conjugates their appearance at a time when _PROTEIN_ was nearly undetectable argued otherwise . to confirm that the response of the plants to extended darkness was a senescence related process we examined the abundance of several transcripts including that from _PROTEIN_ a gene specifically _PROTEIN_ during senescence . similar to previous studies with detached leaves cab mrna levels dropped rapidly following a dark incubation as short as d consistent with the instability of the cab mrna and the light requirement for continued cab transcription . conversely transcripts from the cell division regulator _PROTEIN_ and the senescence associated _PROTEIN_ genes increased during the c limiting treatment . whereas the _PROTEIN_ mrna levels fell after prolonged dark exposure levels of the _PROTEIN_ transcript remain high especially in the _PROTEIN_ background supporting the view that this dark induced chlorosis represents a form of senescence . previous studies found that the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ mrnas are mildly increased during the suc starvation of culture cells and during the senescence of detached leaves . to test if a similar increase could explain the increase in _PROTEIN_ protein during dark induced c starvation in wild type plants and the large increase in _PROTEIN_ protein in the _PROTEIN_ background we compared the abundance of the _PROTEIN_ transcripts and proteins . similar to detached leaves the abundance of the _PROTEIN_ mrna increased during dark induced c starvation of intact wild type plants . more _PROTEIN_ mrna was evident in the _PROTEIN_ background suggesting that _PROTEIN_ of these genes is up regulated by this autophagic defect . to help identify which of the nine _PROTEIN_ transcripts were responsible for this increase during c starvation and the further increase in the _PROTEIN_ mutant we analyzed the abundance of each during the dark treatment by real time rt pcr . we quantified _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ mrna levels using the comparative threshold cycle method . values were normalized to an internal control mrna and _PROTEIN_ relative to those before the dark treatment . as can be seen in figure the relative abundance of most if not all _PROTEIN_ mrnas was slightly or dramatically increased by a d c starvation . several were further increased in the _PROTEIN_ background especially _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . a time course of this induction showed that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts rose dramatically in relative abundance beginning at day and further increased at day despite that _PROTEIN_ that tissue became noticeably senescent with reduced total protein . collectively the data show that _PROTEIN_ mrna levels are up regulated by c starvation with several responsive to the mutation in _PROTEIN_ . these changes may in turn be responsible for the increase in _PROTEIN_ proteins in the _PROTEIN_ seedlings during c starvation . recent studies by citation detected a new _PROTEIN_ species during n starvation that could represent one or more _PROTEIN_ pe adducts based on its faster migration rate . to further examine this possibility we compared the profiles of _PROTEIN_ proteins in nonstarved and c starved wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings using _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with and without m urea . the inclusion of urea was based on previous studies with yeast _PROTEIN_ showing that the pe conjugate migrates faster than free _PROTEIN_ under this electrophoretic condition . unfortunately while a number of _PROTEIN_ species were observed none matched the expectations for the _PROTEIN_ pe adducts . as shown in figure several _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were detected in wild type col and ws seedlings grown in the light with their abundance and complexity further enhanced by the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations . in wild type plants no new species _METHOD_ became evident following a prolonged dark treatment of d sufficient to impair survival . a faster migrating form was detected in c starved _PROTEIN_ plants in both the absence and presence of urea . however similarly sized species were also observed in _PROTEIN_ plants which should lack the capacity to form these lipidated adducts . in an attempt to enrich for possible _PROTEIN_ pe adducts we separated total cell lysates from c starved and nonstarved seedlings by ultracentrifugation and assayed by immunoblotting the _LOCATION_ associated fraction for these species . although we found the presumed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ conjugate of kd in both the supernatant and _LOCATION_ fraction consistent with a peripheral _LOCATION_ association none of the _PROTEIN_ species were in the pellet . collectively the results suggest that the _PROTEIN_ pe conjugates if produced do not become a significant portion of the _PROTEIN_ pool under the conditions studied here . to confirm that the _PROTEIN_ phenotypes were directly caused by a loss of _PROTEIN_ protein we attempted to complement the mutation by ectopic _PROTEIN_ of the wild type _PROTEIN_ cdna . _PROTEIN_ plants transformed with an _PROTEIN_ transgene under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter were selected by hygromycin resistance conferred by the t dna . plants were self fertilized and progenies homozygous for the _PROTEIN_ allele and _PROTEIN_ transgene were identified by pcr and hygromycin resistance respectively . both the _PROTEIN_ transcript and _PROTEIN_ proteins were detected in the complementation line with the ratio of the and kd proteins similar to that found in wild type seedlings . phenotypically plants harboring the _PROTEIN_ transgene behaved like wild type col . under the short day photoperiod they senesced similar to the wild type and much _PROTEIN_ than the _PROTEIN_ mutant parent . the homozygous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings like wild type were also much less sensitive to c limiting conditions induced by darkness than _PROTEIN_ seedlings . we observed no new phenotypes among complementation lines suggesting that possible misexpression of _PROTEIN_ caused by the use of the camv promoter does not interfere with autophagy in particular and overall growth in general . to help detect the various structures associated with autophagy we examined the possibility of using _METHOD_ fusions to _PROTEIN_ proteins as cytological markers . previous studies with both yeast and mammalian cells demonstrated that such fusions can be good markers for visualizing autophagic bodies in vivo . more recently a similar _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion was found to label autophagic body like vesicles in arabidopsis _LOCATION_ . their visualization in arabidopsis required pretreatment with the _LOCATION_ h _PROTEIN_ inhibitor concanamycin a which appears to block _LOCATION_ hydrolysis by raising the internal ph above the optimum for many _LOCATION_ enzymes . here we introduced a transgene _PROTEIN_ a _METHOD_ fusion to the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ into wild type col and _PROTEIN_ plants . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ immunoblot analysis with anti _PROTEIN_ and anti _METHOD_ antibodies detected a kd protein in both plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ consistent with the expected size of the chimeric protein . using _METHOD_ confocal microscopy we monitored hypocotyl cells of young seedlings after d in n rich and n deficient media . as shown in the top sections of figure _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is predominately cytoplasmic in wild type cells with or without n starvation . upon concanamycin a treatment punctate structures accumulated in the central _LOCATION_ with substantially more present upon n starvation . upon closer examination they resembled autophagic bodies some appearing as hollow spherical vesicles with a diameter of to . unlike transvacuolar strands/tubes that are highly dynamic and can appear as vesicles in cross section the vesicles labeled with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ displayed a slow random motion indicating that they were free floating within the _LOCATION_ lumen . the accumulation of these vesicles required the _PROTEIN_ conjugation system further supporting the possibility that they represents autophagic bodies . even after n starvation and treatment with concanamycin a we failed to detect these vesicles in _PROTEIN_ seedlings . this pattern was also distinct from that observed with wild type plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ alone from the camv promoter . here we observed diffuse staining of just the cytoplasm which did not change upon n starvation with or without concanamycin a .
