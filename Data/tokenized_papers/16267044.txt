in plant pumps belonging to the subfamily of p type _PROTEIN_ the n terminal cytoplasmic domain is responsible for pump autoinhibition . binding of calmodulin to this region results in pump activation but the structural basis for cam activation is still not clear . all residues in a putative cam binding domain were mutagenized and the resulting recombinant proteins were studied with respect to cam binding and the activation state . the results demonstrate that the binding site for cam is overlapping with the autoinhibitory region and the autoinhibitory region comprises significantly fewer residues than the cam binding region . in a helical wheel projection of the cam binding domain residues involved in autoinhibition cluster on one side of the helix which is proposed to interact with an intramolecular receptor site in the pump . residues influencing cam negatively are situated on the other face of the helix likely to face the _LOCATION_ whereas residues controlling cam binding positively are scattered throughout . we propose that early cam recognition is mediated by the _LOCATION_ face and that cam subsequently competes with the intramolecular autoinhibitor in binding to the other face of the helix .
identification of deregulated pumps by functional complementation of a yeast a number of autoinhibited proteins such as cam activated pumps and kinases the binding site for the activating protein overlaps with the autoinhibitory region of the molecule . to understand the mechanism of enzyme activation a detailed characterization and comparison of residues involved in protein protein interaction and autoinhibition is a prerequisite . such an analysis has to our knowledge not been carried out for any autoinhibited protein activated by cam . to investigate the relationship between autoinhibitory and cam binding residues in a cam activated pump we focused on _PROTEIN_ an arabidopsis _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ with a cam binding site at its n terminus . first a series of _PROTEIN_ mutants carrying amino acid substitutions in the presumed n terminal cambd were studied for their ability to functionally complement a yeast strain devoid of and the two _PROTEIN_ present in this organism . it has previously been shown that a plant _PROTEIN_ is not able to complement and unless the pump molecule is deregulated either by removal of the regulatory n terminus or by point mutations in the regulatory region . mutant _PROTEIN_ pumps carrying ala substitutions at six amino acid positions were able to support growth of under calcium stress conditions indicating that mutations of these residues result in pumps that can functionally replace yeast _PROTEIN_ . localization of plant _PROTEIN_ in transgenic yeast pumps and are localized to internal _LOCATION_ . thus improved ability of _PROTEIN_ mutants to complement for and could have resulted from re localization of the heterologous protein within the yeast cells . indeed whereas _PROTEIN_ is known to be _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of plant cells bonza et al . showed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in yeast is enriched in a fraction containing _LOCATION_ derived from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to localize the recombinant plant proteins in transgenic yeast cells _PROTEIN_ and two mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were equipped with a _METHOD_ tag and _PROTEIN_ in yeast . addition of the _METHOD_ tag to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ resulted in pumps that supported growth of to the same degree as non tagged versions . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in transgenic yeast cells was visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy . for all three pumps _METHOD_ was intense in the periphery of cells and around the _LOCATION_ indicating localization at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ respectively . the pattern of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was identical for all three plant pumps indicating that targeting of recombinant plant _PROTEIN_ was not affected by the mutations . measurements of pump activity ability of mutant plant _PROTEIN_ to complement their yeast counterparts could be the result of differential _PROTEIN_ . however this possibility could be ruled out as all the pumps were _PROTEIN_ at similar levels . alternatively improved complementation could be related to increased specific activity of mutant pumps . to test this possibility the _PROTEIN_ hydrolytic activity in yeast microsomal _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and derived mutants were analyzed in the presence and absence of cam . hardly any _PROTEIN_ hydrolytic activity could be measured for wild type _PROTEIN_ in buffer without cam _LOCATION_ whereas addition of cam resulted in increased activity of the pump by fold _LOCATION_ . n terminal truncated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ had high basal activity that could not be stimulated further by cam as has been shown for other pumps illustrating that truncation of the n terminus releases autoinhibition of pump activity . six mutants and showed increased activity in buffer without cam compared with wild type _LOCATION_ . the activity of these mutants in buffer was between and of the activity in the /cam buffer . the deregulated mutants were all able to functionally complement yeast and . in addition to these six mutants three mutants and also showed an increased activity in buffer _LOCATION_ corresponding to of the cam stimulated activity . none of these three mutants although were able to functionally complement the yeast _PROTEIN_ ases . this would indicate that a certain activity threshold is required for complementation of and to occur . cam overlay assays to detect cam binding to mutated _PROTEIN_ n having identified residues in the putative cambd of importance for pump autoinhibition we decided to map in detail residues of importance for cam binding . for this purpose the n terminal region of _PROTEIN_ comprising residues to as well as variants carrying single amino acid substitutions at every position in the stretch comprising arg and lys were _PROTEIN_ in e. coli as tagged proteins . cam binding was next examined by cam overlay assays to purified immobilized fusion proteins . binding to cam was severely reduced in the case of four mutants . furthermore eight mutants showed reduced binding of cam compared with wild type . in all cases cam binding was dependent as interaction with peptide was never observed in the absence of . binding kinetics of cam to wild type and mutants of _PROTEIN_ assays suggested that the number of residues involved in binding of cam was significantly higher than the number of residues involved in autoinhibition . to confirm this finding and to analyze the observed protein protein interactions in more detail binding of cam to the recombinant n termini of _PROTEIN_ was further analyzed by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy . this gave us the association rate and dissociation rate for cam binding to _PROTEIN_ n termini and then the binding affinity could be estimated as the ratio between the kinetic constants of the dissociation and association reaction . although binding kinetics were slightly altered for most mutants four mutants and showed a severely reduced cam binding by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy . in _PROTEIN_ it was not possible to estimate kinetic and equilibrium parameters for and as the signal was too low even at the highest cam concentration tested whereas mutants and both exhibited a strongly reduced affinity for cam compared with wild type _PROTEIN_ . the reduced binding observed by surface plasmon spectroscopy was well in agreement with our results from the cam overlay assays . in addition to these four mutants we found that the binding affinity for cam compared with wild type _PROTEIN_ was significantly _PROTEIN_ for the following nine mutants and . the reduced binding affinity primarily resulted from a faster dissociation of cam from the n termini of these mutants than from the n terminus of wild type _PROTEIN_ . accordingly these residues seem to be important for the stability of the complex between cam and the cambd of _PROTEIN_ . one of these nine residues val may also be important for the recognition of cam because its mutant exhibited an increase in its association rate toward cam _PROTEIN_ . the effect of this increase in association rate on cam affinity was counteracted by an increase of the dissociation rate of cam . in addition to three other mutants and had a faster association of cam than wild type _PROTEIN_ . as a result of the increased association rate the binding affinity of cam to these three n termini was slightly increased compared with wild type _PROTEIN_ . among the mutants investigated only substitution of arg gln trp lys val and phe significantly affected the association rate of the protein toward cam which would suggest that these residues are directly involved in cam recognition . two mutants and also showed a slight increase in cam affinity but this was caused by small alterations in both the association and dissociation rate which did not seem to be notably different from wild type . likewise all the remaining mutants had reaction kinetics similar to those of wild type resulting in kd values ranging between and nm . mutants that demonstrated reduced cam binding affinity by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy likewise showed reduced interaction in cam overlay assays except for the mutant . this mutant showed a slight _PROTEIN_ cam binding affinity by surface plasmon resonance but apparently similar cam binding as wild type _PROTEIN_ by the cam overlay assay . similarly in the cam overlay assay it was not possible to see any noteworthy differences in cam binding to mutants and although they showed a small increase in cam binding affinity by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy . these differences probably reflect a reduced sensitivity of cam overlay assay compared with surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy . correlation of cam stimulation with cam is worth noting that all mutants with the exception of were stimulated by cam in the _PROTEIN_ assays . even the four mutants and that exhibited extremely low affinity for cam were stimulated by cam . in the soybean _PROTEIN_ two cambds have been identified in the n terminal domain . we therefore tested the possibility that _PROTEIN_ could contain an additional cambd downstream of ala and therefore not present in the tagged n termini of _PROTEIN_ . cam overlay assays on yeast microsomes _PROTEIN_ full length pumps were performed and the results were similar to those of the cam overlay assays on the n termini . thus only an extremely weak binding of cam could be observed for and . no binding of cam was observed for _PROTEIN_ arguing against a second cambd outside this region in _PROTEIN_ . cam was found to activate the wild type pump with a half maximal concentration of nm which explains why cam is sufficient to cause at least partial activation even of low affinity mutants .
plasmid directed mutagenesis of _PROTEIN_ was performed by overlap extension polymerase chain reaction to produce mutant genes encoding the individual alanine substitutions _PROTEIN_ throughout to _PROTEIN_ . in the case of ala ala and ala these residues were substituted with ser . three _LOCATION_ acid substitutions _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and were introduced as silent mutations in the coding sequence of _PROTEIN_ to generate unique sites for the restriction enzymes spei and xmai respectively . this allowed for introduction of mutations by a cassette mutagenesis strategy to generate mutant genes encoding _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ throughout to _PROTEIN_ . all mutations were verified by dna sequencing . wild type _PROTEIN_ and mutants were inserted into the yeast _PROTEIN_ vector under control of a galactose inducible promoter . for localization purposes a green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ was fused to the ends of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the vector just in front of the stop codon of the genes . _PROTEIN_ does not encode the first amino acid residues of the regulatory n terminus . to produce recombinant n terminal domain that could _PROTEIN_ be purified by _PROTEIN_ affinity chromatography the coding sequences for the n termini of wild type and mutants of _PROTEIN_ were inserted into the escherichia coli _PROTEIN_ vector in this way fusing a tag to the n terminus of the peptide . yeast strains transformation and growth saccharomyces cerevisiae strain _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was used for _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the generated mutants . yeast cells were transformed using a lithium acetate/single stranded dna/polyethylene glycol method . likewise the yeast strain _PROTEIN_ was transformed with the empty vector . the transformants were selected for uracil prototrophy by plating on yeast medium containing _PROTEIN_ bacto agar mm succinic acid ph yeast nitrogen base adenine of the amino acids his leu and trp and mm . complementation of the yeast mutant tests were performed as previously described . localization of _METHOD_ fusion proteins in yeast yeast colonies from transformation of with the _METHOD_ fusion proteins of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were inoculated in galactose mm succinic acid ph yeast nitrogen base adenine and mm for h at . the cells were pelleted washed and resuspended in . three of a mixture of yeast cells of and agarose were mounted on a polylysinecoated microscope slide . _METHOD_ was measured with a confocal laser scanning microscope _METHOD_ with _METHOD_ filter setting excited at nm and emission recorded at nm . isolation of yeast _LOCATION_ pumps were _PROTEIN_ in yeast grown in bacto yeast extract bacto peptone gal adenine and mm for h at . microsomes were harvested as described with slight modifications . the _PROTEIN_ level of the pumps in microsomes was analyzed by western blotting using a specific antibody against the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ activity was determined as described . five of _LOCATION_ proteins from _PROTEIN_ wild type or mutant _PROTEIN_ were assayed for min at in the following four buffers mm _PROTEIN_ mm mm sodium molybdate mm mm bis tris hepes ph mg/ml brij mm mm _PROTEIN_ mm egta with and without bovine brain cam and with and without to give a free concentration of . free concentrations were estimated by the program webmaxclite version . activities without were subtracted from those with to give the _PROTEIN_ activity . addition of cam in the absence of did not result in any change in _PROTEIN_ hydrolytic activity . fusion protein _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins were _PROTEIN_ in e. coli strain plyss by standard procedures . fusion proteins were purified from inclusion bodies on _PROTEIN_ agarose and renaturated while bound to the affinity _PROTEIN_ by a procedure from amersham biosciences with the following modifications . the pellet was disrupted by sonication in mm tris hcl buffer . all buffers included mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and mm dithiothreitol instead of mercaptoethanol . finally fusion proteins were eluted with mm imidazole in mm tris hcl m nacl ph . protein concentrations were determined by the method of bradford . if not indicated otherwise globulin was used as a protein standard . cam overlay of purified n termini were subjected to cam overlay assays as described previously . as a protein control of the purified n termini were examined by western blotting using penta his antibody . surface plasmon resonance plasmon resonance spectroscopy was achieved with a biacorex optical biosensor instrument using a _PROTEIN_ sensor _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . surface plasmon resonance buffers were as follows regeneration buffer mm hepes m nacl m edta surfactant ph immobilization buffer mm hepes m nacl surfactant ph nickel buffer in immobilization buffer eluent buffer mm egta mm bis tris hepes ph mm kcl mm ammonium molybdate mm mg/ml brij mm mm inosine triphosphate and to give a free concentration of . all reactions were done at . the sensor _PROTEIN_ contains two flow cells that are run in parallel of which one provides background corrections for nonspecific binding of cam . after extensive washing with regeneration buffer followed by immobilization buffer the _PROTEIN_ surface was saturated with by loading nickel buffer into the two flow cells . the tagged n termini were injected into one of the flow cells in immobilization buffer until a resonance response unit of was obtained . the buffer was changed to eluent buffer and a concentration range of bovine brain cam in eluent buffer was injected into both flow cells . after the dissociation phase the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was regenerated by injection of regeneration buffer . the data were analyzed using biaevaluation software and kinetic analyses of primary _METHOD_ were carried our by global fitting using a langmuir binding model .
