calcium dependent protein kinases are sensor transducer proteins capable of decoding calcium signals in diverse phosphorylation dependent calcium signaling networks in plants and some protists . using a novel yeast two hybrid approach with constitutively active and/or catalytically inactive _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ as bait we identified _PROTEIN_ as an _PROTEIN_ interacting protein . _PROTEIN_ is a member of a small family of stress induced genes . the interaction was confirmed using pull down assays with in vitro translated _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and localization studies in arabidopsis protoplasts cotransfected with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ protein fusions . we further showed that the interaction of _PROTEIN_ is specific to both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ whereas other closely related cpks from arabidopsis interacted weakly _PROTEIN_ or did not interact _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ . deletion analyses showed that a region containing two predicted _LOCATION_ localization signals and a _LOCATION_ export signal of _PROTEIN_ is essential for interaction with _PROTEIN_ . we further demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ is phosphorylated by _PROTEIN_ in a ca dependent manner at and within the _PROTEIN_ bipartite nls using in vitro kinase assays . our data suggest that disruption of the autoinhibitor domain leading to the formation of a constitutively active cdpk may stabilize kinase substrate interactions without affecting specificity .
the _PROTEIN_ gene encodes a predicted protein of amino acid containing the well conserved protein kinase domain and a c terminal domain with four ef hands involved in calcium binding joined together by an auto inhibitor or pseudosubstrate domain . the first amino acids form the n terminal domain which is highly variable in both length and sequence in most cdpks typically contains subcellular targeting information . however _PROTEIN_ is one of only five arabidopsis cdpks without a predicted n terminal myristoylation site . the yeast two hybrid system has been previously used to identify substrates for cdpks . in both cases the efficiency of recovering kinase substrates was improved through the use of truncated versions of the cdpk . for _PROTEIN_ we tested the hypothesis that the use of catalytically impaired and/or constitutively active variants of _PROTEIN_ baits would improve the efficiency of recovery of putative prey proteins . none of the three baits were able to auto induce the reporter gene . we identified five clones corresponding to the _PROTEIN_ gene . moreover _PROTEIN_ was detected in the screens performed using the three different _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ baits . specific interaction between baits and _PROTEIN_ in yeast was confirmed as yeast co transformed with the three baits and rescued _PROTEIN_ plasmid were able to grow in selective medium whereas cells co transformed with empty vector and _PROTEIN_ plasmid did not show any indication of interaction . _PROTEIN_ interacted strongly with all three mutated versions of _PROTEIN_ but only very weakly with the wild type kinase . to validate the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ observed in the yeast two hybrid system we tested the ability of these two proteins to interact using an in vitro pull down assay . _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in the presence of met in a coupled in vitro transcription/translation wheat germ extract system . a full length protein was obtained along with additional lower molecular weight products which are likely truncation products . for the interaction assay met labeled _PROTEIN_ was incubated with resin bound _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . after washing the presence of _PROTEIN_ was clearly detected in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ sample showing interaction whereas binding of _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ was almost undetectable . _PROTEIN_ is one of only a few arabidopsis cdpks that are not predicted to undergo n terminal acylation . like _PROTEIN_ which is identical to _PROTEIN_ and has been shown to have a _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ localization in transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ lacks an n terminal acylation consensus motif and contains two potential nlss p krk and p kkr . thus _PROTEIN_ is expected to have a similar subcellular distribution . in agreement with this prediction we found that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized throughout the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ in arabidopsis protoplasts . the observation that _PROTEIN_ is localized in both the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ suggests that these proteins may shuttle between the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . we next studied the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ by fusing its complete predicted open reading frame to the n terminus of protein . the _PROTEIN_ fusion protein displayed a speckled pattern of _LOCATION_ localization . this localization pattern is consistent with the nls and nes sequences present in _PROTEIN_ and it would appear that its default localization is _LOCATION_ . the presence of both nls and nes sequences in a protein suggests that its _LOCATION_ concentration could be tightly regulated in response to different types of signals through the modulation of both _LOCATION_ import and export . finally the common localization pattern of both protein fusions is also consistent with interactions occurring between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ where both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are present . _PROTEIN_ belongs to a family of cdpks in arabidopsis . we tested whether other closely related cdpks could interact with _PROTEIN_ in a yth system . constitutively active _METHOD_ of five other cdpks located on the same branch of the cdpk phylogenetic tree group as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were cloned into the pbute vector to make fusions and tested for their interaction with _PROTEIN_ . interestingly only _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which are most similar to _PROTEIN_ interacted with _PROTEIN_ . however when interaction was tested at a higher stringency _PROTEIN_ only _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interacted with _PROTEIN_ indicating that interaction with these proteins is more specific . none of the kinases showed autoinduction of the gene as bait and as expected none of the wild type kinases interacted with _PROTEIN_ under the conditions tested . the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ is not surprising as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are two of the most closely related cdpks in arabidopsis . however both proteins may undergo different regulation in the plant . the weak interaction detected between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is consistent with the above observations as this kinase is the next most closely related member of the cdpk superfamily . our study also included the constitutively active _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ demonstrated previously to be partially ca independent and _PROTEIN_ another soluble cdpk highly similar to _PROTEIN_ with the same subcellular localization pattern as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . taken together our results indicate that constitutively active cdpks can be used to identify interaction partners that are specific for a particular cdpk . during yeast two hybrid screening we observed that one of the five _PROTEIN_ prey clones encoded only the first amino acids of the _PROTEIN_ protein and lacked the c terminal domain of amino acids . this observation suggested that the interaction with _PROTEIN_ could occur through the n terminal segment of the protein . to identify the _PROTEIN_ region responsible for the interaction with _PROTEIN_ the full length _PROTEIN_ and five deletion constructs were cloned into and introduced into yeast cells together with the pbute _PROTEIN_ plasmid . _PROTEIN_ deletion constructs in the presence of empty bait vector were not able to grow on his medium . removal of the c terminal domain of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which did not prevent interaction with _PROTEIN_ suggests that this c terminal domain _PROTEIN_ is not necessary for interaction . this was further confirmed by the lack of interaction between _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ construct . in addition n terminal residues of _PROTEIN_ do not appear to participate in the interaction with _PROTEIN_ either because the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with a construct lacking this and the c terminal regions _PROTEIN_ was as strong as with the full length _PROTEIN_ . the central region of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ contains a domain with two _PROTEIN_ like zinc fingers . in addition it contains a monopartite nls and a bipartite nls _PROTEIN_ predicted by the psort software . moreover a leucine rich sequence was predicted to be a putative nes by the netnes software . we tested the interaction of the zn finger domains and the nls/nes sequences with _PROTEIN_ and determined that the nls/nes region was necessary and sufficient for interaction with the kinase although this interaction was slightly weaker than if both zn finger domains and the nls/nes region were present . taken together these deletion analyses indicate that _PROTEIN_ may interact with _PROTEIN_ through the nls nes region although we can not preclude a role for the zinc finger like domains in the interaction with _PROTEIN_ . to determine if _PROTEIN_ is a substrate of _PROTEIN_ we tested its ability to be phosphorylated by _PROTEIN_ using an in vitro kinase assay . recombinant his tagged _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ in e. coli and purified by affinity chromatography . recombinant _PROTEIN_ phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ after a short incubation period with _PROTEIN_ corroborating the interaction observed in previous assays . autophosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ was more evident when it was incubated with the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein than when _PROTEIN_ was incubated alone or with _PROTEIN_ . this suggests that autophosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ is enhanced upon binding to the substrate . autophosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation were ca dependent . as expected no phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was observed when it was incubated with _PROTEIN_ containing the mutation which conferred a catalytically inactive kinase . this result demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is phosphorylated by _PROTEIN_ . taken together these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ can interact with and be phosphorylated by _PROTEIN_ in a ca dependent manner . recently _METHOD_ _METHOD_ has been widely used to identify proteins and post translational modification of proteins . to identify potential _PROTEIN_ residues phosphorylated by _PROTEIN_ we performed maldi tof _METHOD_ and ion trap _METHOD_ . maldi tof _METHOD_ analysis identified a phosphorylated peptide within _PROTEIN_ bipartite nls sequence . the m / z and amino acid sequence of the peptide was and s rksgtnstlsllr respectively . the phosphorylated residues of the peptide could not be unambiguously determined . in addition _METHOD_ analysis identified another phosphorylated peptide . the m / z and amino acid sequence of the peptide was and s _PROTEIN_ respectively . the _METHOD_ data showed that ser and thr were not phosphorylated . nevertheless the phosphorylation of ser thr and ser could not be unambiguously determined which indicated that _PROTEIN_ may phosphorylate within the _PROTEIN_ bipartite nls at multiple residues . this hypothesis was further confirmed by in vitro kinase assays using the peptide s _PROTEIN_ fused to _PROTEIN_ as a substrate . we demonstrated that this wild type peptide was phosphorylated by _PROTEIN_ in vitro . this k m value is within the expected range for a protein to be considered a good substrate for a cdpk . as expected no phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was observed when it was incubated with _PROTEIN_ containing the mutation . in addition using the same peptide containing individual mutations of ser thr and ser to ala we showed that one or both thr and ser are the preferred sites phosphorylated by _PROTEIN_ as mutations of these residues reduced phosphorylation of the peptide to only and relative to the wild type respectively . the s llr motif resembles a typical phosphorylation site for cdpks but the thr site appears to be novel . there are two major conclusions that can be drawn from this study . first our data suggest that the _PROTEIN_ mutation makes the interaction of the kinase with _PROTEIN_ more stable . second to validate our approach we have demonstrated that constitutively active _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ through the same domain that is phosphorylated by the wild type kinase . these results together with the analysis of the interaction of similar cdpks with _PROTEIN_ suggest that disruption of the autoinhibitor does not affect the specificity of the kinase for its substrate . thus it is possible that the same approach could be used to improve the efficiency of identifying candidate substrates for other cdpks .
