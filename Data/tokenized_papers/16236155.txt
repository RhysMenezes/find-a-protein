_PROTEIN_ domain proteins are a class of _LOCATION_ that have been described in yeast and animals . they locate to the trans _LOCATION_ network and are thought to play a role in endosome to _LOCATION_ trafficking . the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ domain protein _PROTEIN_ fused to the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ locates to _LOCATION_ stacks but does not exactly co locate with the _LOCATION_ marker sialyl transferase _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ nor with the t snares _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . we conclude that the location of _PROTEIN_ is further to the trans side of the stack than _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the aa c terminus of _PROTEIN_ containing the _PROTEIN_ domain targeted _METHOD_ to the _LOCATION_ although a proportion of the fusion protein was still found in the _LOCATION_ . mutation of a conserved tyrosine to alanine in the _PROTEIN_ domain disrupted _LOCATION_ localization . _PROTEIN_ is a small _PROTEIN_ required for _LOCATION_ targeting of _PROTEIN_ domain proteins in other _METHOD_ . an arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ homologue was isolated and shown to target to _LOCATION_ stacks . the gdp restricted mutant of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was observed to locate partially to the _LOCATION_ whereas the _PROTEIN_ restricted mutant _PROTEIN_ labelled the _LOCATION_ and a population of small structures . increasing the levels of _PROTEIN_ in epidermal cells increased the proportion of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein on _LOCATION_ stacks . we show moreover that _PROTEIN_ interacted with the _PROTEIN_ domain in a _PROTEIN_ dependent manner in vitro in affinity chromatography and in the yeast two hybrid system . this indicates that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interact directly . we conclude that the pathway involving _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ domain _LOCATION_ is conserved in plants .
blast searches of the arabidopsis genomic database with the mammalian _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ proteins and _LOCATION_ identified an orf which shared significant sequence similarity with the query sequences . further inspection revealed that the region of sequence similarity is centred around the c terminus of both query sequences and corresponds to the c terminus of _GENE_ . this arabidopsis orf encodes a aa protein with extensive coiled coil regions in the n terminal amino acids based on a prediction by the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ database . the c terminus of this protein contains a _PROTEIN_ domain with and identity to the _PROTEIN_ domains of and _LOCATION_ respectively . this arabidopsis orf has been described previously and its _PROTEIN_ domain was shown to localize to _LOCATION_ stacks . a full length _PROTEIN_ cdna clone was isolated from an arabidopsis cell culture cdna pool by pcr amplification using gene specific primers . the cdna clone was inserted into binary vectors to create translational fusions with _METHOD_ in either orientation . the fusion proteins _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ transiently in tobacco by agro infiltration . is a transgenic line _PROTEIN_ the transmembrane domain of rat sialyl transferase _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ under control of the enhanced cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . the infiltrated tissue was examined by confocal microscopy days _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were both observed as green moving bodies in the cytoplasm of epidermal cells . when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were imaged together the green and red signals were clearly located on the same bodies . _PROTEIN_ is well established as a _LOCATION_ marker in plants . the co localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ therefore indicates that _PROTEIN_ was _LOCATION_ localized . closer examination of the confocal images clearly showed that the _METHOD_ signals from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were not completely co localized . _PROTEIN_ was previously shown to reside predominantly in the medial and trans _LOCATION_ by immunogold labelling . to determine in which part of the _LOCATION_ stack _PROTEIN_ resides _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ in leaves in combination with _METHOD_ fusion proteins of three different arabidopsis t snares _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ are thought to be predominantly located in the cis _LOCATION_ whereas _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ detected in the trans _LOCATION_ based on differences in brefeldin a responses . in figure _METHOD_ is shown as green _METHOD_ as red and _METHOD_ as blue . in cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in combination with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ as well as in cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in combination with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ three coloured _LOCATION_ stacks were detected each of the three fusion proteins located to a different part of the stack . in some stacks a clear pattern was distinguished _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was detected in the centre with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ on one side and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ respectively on the other side . not all stacks appeared the same which is presumably due to the _PROTEIN_ that _LOCATION_ stacks are in motion and constantly tumble around their axes with the result that different stacks will be at different orientations to the plane of scanning . in cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ co located with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ whereas _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was adjacent to this area . because _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was adjacent to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and on the opposite side of the stack to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ it was concluded that _PROTEIN_ was located to the far side of the trans _LOCATION_ stacks or to the tgn . the n terminal aa of _PROTEIN_ were fused to _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaves by agro infiltration . the fusion protein _METHOD_ nterm showed staining throughout the cell a pattern most reminiscent of _LOCATION_ staining . the protein was also found in the _LOCATION_ . we expected that the _PROTEIN_ domain of _PROTEIN_ would locate to _LOCATION_ stacks . to verify this the aa _PROTEIN_ domain of _PROTEIN_ was fused to _METHOD_ . unexpectedly this fusion protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was detected almost exclusively in the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ . however in some cells weak co localization with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was observed in punctate structures . a second _PROTEIN_ domain fusion protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ consisting of the c terminal aa of _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ located much more efficiently to _LOCATION_ stacks although a considerable amount of the fusion protein was still detected in the cytoplasm . these results indicate that the residues adjacent to the _PROTEIN_ domain in _PROTEIN_ greatly enhance _LOCATION_ localization of the _PROTEIN_ domain . previous studies have shown that mutation of a conserved tyrosine in the _PROTEIN_ domain to alanine disrupts _LOCATION_ localization . the corresponding tyrosine residue in _PROTEIN_ was identified as and replaced by an alanine . the _PROTEIN_ domain with the mutation _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ failed to localize to _LOCATION_ stacks and was instead distributed to the _LOCATION_ . this demonstrates that tyrosine in _PROTEIN_ is crucial for _LOCATION_ localization in plants . in animals and yeast the _PROTEIN_ domain binds to a small _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to find out whether _PROTEIN_ is conserved as _PROTEIN_ domain receptor in plants the arabidopsis genomic database was searched using the blast algorithm with human _PROTEIN_ as a query sequence . many of the arabidopsis arfs and arf like proteins share significant similarity with . alignment of _PROTEIN_ proteins from rat fly worm and budding yeast with _PROTEIN_ from rat and budding yeast revealed several residues that are conserved in all _PROTEIN_ proteins but not in _PROTEIN_ . from the group of arabidopsis proteins identified in the blast search with human _PROTEIN_ one was found to possess all but one of the residues that are characteristic for _PROTEIN_ and is identical to human _PROTEIN_ . this protein has been described previously and although the authors noticed the sequence similarity with the _PROTEIN_ family of proteins it was designated _PROTEIN_ . the cdna encoding this protein corresponding to orf _GENE_ was amplified from an arabidopsis cell culture cdna pool . the cdna was inserted into a binary vector to create a translational fusion to the end of the _METHOD_ gene . the resulting protein was _PROTEIN_ transiently in tobacco and the infiltrated leaves were examined by confocal microscopy . green moving bodies were detected in epidermal cells . the same bodies were labelled with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showing that this protein localizes to _LOCATION_ stacks . based on its similarity with human _PROTEIN_ and its localization to _LOCATION_ stacks this protein was renamed _PROTEIN_ . atarl _METHOD_ was co _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in tobacco epidermal cells . when both proteins were _PROTEIN_ at low levels _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ located to the same part of the _LOCATION_ stacks . when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ at higher levels the fusion protein was also detected in other parts of the stacks . to investigate differences between _PROTEIN_ in the gdp and _PROTEIN_ bound _METHOD_ amino acid changes were introduced that were previously reported to result in _PROTEIN_ and gdp restricted _METHOD_ of small _PROTEIN_ . to create the gdp restricted form a threonine residue at position was replaced by asparagine . to create the _PROTEIN_ restricted form a glutamine residue at position was replaced by leucine . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were fused to the n terminus of _METHOD_ and the fusion proteins were transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaves . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized to _LOCATION_ stacks and was detected in the _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ . wild type _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was also occasionally found in the _LOCATION_ but this was observed only in cells that _PROTEIN_ very high levels of the fusion protein . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in contrast was detected in the _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ even when levels of _PROTEIN_ were very low . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ similarly located to _LOCATION_ stacks but was also detected on a large number of small irregularly shaped moving bodies . these bodies occasionally associated with _LOCATION_ stacks forming irregularly shaped complexes . we attempted to identify the nature of the bodies and co _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with proteins known to be involved in post _LOCATION_ trafficking . the plant rab proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and m rab its homologue from mesembryanthemum crystallinum label pre _LOCATION_ compartments . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was co _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ and m rab but neither of these proteins co located with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ specific bodies showing that these bodies are unlikely to be pre _LOCATION_ compartments . untagged _PROTEIN_ was co _PROTEIN_ in tobacco epidermal cells together with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . to ensure that _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in most cells the agrobacterium strain carrying the construct from which _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ was infiltrated at a high concentration . the strain carrying the construct from which _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ was infiltrated at a lower concentration . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ on its own is detected on _LOCATION_ stacks and in the _LOCATION_ . in the presence of overexpressed _PROTEIN_ all _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was detected on _LOCATION_ stacks and there was hardly any _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ present in the _LOCATION_ . when _PROTEIN_ was used instead of wild type _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was found predominantly in the _LOCATION_ . in contrast _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in an _PROTEIN_ background was found _PROTEIN_ on _LOCATION_ stacks as was the case with wild type _PROTEIN_ . however some _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was detected on small bodies similar in size to those detected with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . to find out if binding of the _PROTEIN_ domain was specific _PROTEIN_ was co _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . all _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was _LOCATION_ in the presence of _PROTEIN_ and this pattern did not change when _PROTEIN_ was replaced by _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . this demonstrates that _PROTEIN_ and the mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ do not bind _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and that binding is specific for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . to investigate whether the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ domain of _PROTEIN_ was direct and could be reconstituted in vitro _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ domain fragment of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were both _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were fused with glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ to facilitate protein purification . like most members of the arf family _PROTEIN_ possesses a glycine at position that is myristoylated allowing the protein to be associated with the _LOCATION_ in its active conformation . to improve solubility of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein the first aa of _PROTEIN_ were removed . previous experiments with an arf mutant lacking the first aa showed that such removal of the n terminus did not affect effector binding . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were tagged with six histidines on the n terminus to allow detection of the proteins on western blot using anti antibodies . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was immobilized on glutathione sepharose beads in the presence of gdp or the non hydrolysable _PROTEIN_ analogue _PROTEIN_ . bacterial lysates of strains _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ were applied onto the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ beads again in the presence of gdp or _PROTEIN_ . the bound proteins were eluted in a buffer containing the opposite nucleotide _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the eluted proteins were analysed on _METHOD_ blue stained _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and on western blot incubated with an anti antibody . as shown in the top panel of figure there was clear binding between the tagged _PROTEIN_ domain and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the presence of _PROTEIN_ . in the presence of gdp no binding was observed . there was only a low level of binding between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ gdp . the interaction between the _PROTEIN_ restricted mutant _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was comparable with wild type _PROTEIN_ whereas the gdp restricted mutant _PROTEIN_ showed no binding . again _PROTEIN_ showed no significant binding to either mutant . the lower bands in the _METHOD_ stained gels and on the western blots presumably correspond to a breakdown product of the full length protein . next binding between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was analysed using the yeast two hybrid system . wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were fused at their n termini with the activation domain of again excluding the first aa of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ domain fragments _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were fused to the c terminus of the binding domain . a prey and bait construct was sequentially transformed into yeast and the transformants were plated on selection plates . only the combination of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ produced colonies and these colonies tested positive in the x gal assay indicating that these two fusion proteins interact . neither _PROTEIN_ nor _PROTEIN_ interacted with wild type _PROTEIN_ in this assay and _PROTEIN_ tested negative with both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ .
