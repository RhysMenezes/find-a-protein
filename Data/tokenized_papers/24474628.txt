the pollen coat protects pollen grains from harmful environmental stresses such as drought and cold . many compounds in the pollen coat are synthesized in the tapetum . however the pathway by which they are transferred to the pollen surface remains obscure . we found that two arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ binding cassette transporters _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were highly _PROTEIN_ in the tapetum and are involved in pollen coat deposition . upon exposure to dry air many _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen grains shriveled up and collapsed and this phenotype was restored by complementation with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . electron microscopy revealed that the mutant pollen coat resembled the immature coat of the wild type which contained many electron lucent structures . steryl glycosides were reduced to about half of wild type levels in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen but no differences in free sterols or steryl esters were observed . a mutant deficient in steryl glycoside biosynthesis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ exhibited a similar phenotype . together these results indicate that steryl glycosides are critical for pollen fitness by supporting pollen coat maturation and that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ contribute to the accumulation of this sterol on the surface of pollen .
to identify candidate transporters that are involved in the transport of lipids to the pollen surface we searched for arabidopsis abcg transporter genes that are highly _PROTEIN_ in a developing bud using an in silico database _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . among the candidates _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were specifically _PROTEIN_ in the stamen and in no other parts of developing flowers _PROTEIN_ . furthermore no mrna signal was detected for these genes in or which lack stamens but a strong signal was detected in sup which produces supernumerary stamens . interestingly these two genes were highly coexpressed _PROTEIN_ . moreover no other abc genes were found to be strongly coexpressed with either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was the only abc protein gene among the genes identified as the most highly coexpressed genes with _PROTEIN_ and vice versa . for the functional analysis of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in planta we obtained two independent _PROTEIN_ t dna insertional mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ from the salk institute and two independent _PROTEIN_ t dna insertional mutants from the salk institute _PROTEIN_ and gabi kat _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ contained t dnas in the third and second exons of _PROTEIN_ respectively whereas _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ contained t dnas in the intron and exon of _PROTEIN_ respectively . the insertion sites were verified by genomic dna pcr . rt pcr analysis confirmed that all of the homozygous mutant plants were complete knockouts . neither of the knockout plants displayed any visible defects in overall development . if _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have similar functions deletion of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ would lead to a more pronounced phenotype than that observed for either of the single knockout plants . thus we generated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double knockout plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by crossing _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ . the homozygous knockout plants were identified using genomic dna pcr and rt pcr . the double knockout plants exhibited no prominent aberrant phenotype in _METHOD_ of gross morphology or development when grown under normal conditions . to test whether the pollen surface of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double knockout plants was defective we observed wild type and mutant pollen grains by scanning electron microscopy without any fixation step . in contrast to the wild type and single knockout pollen many of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen grains were shriveled up and clumped together _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . this phenotype was rescued by introducing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ into _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . there was no difference between the genotypes in _METHOD_ of reticular pollen wall pattern . the shriveled shape of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen grains led us to suspect that the mutant pollen does not function normally . to test this possibility we performed a pollen viability assay by staining the pollen with fluorescein diacetate _PROTEIN_ and propidium iodide _PROTEIN_ . about half of the pollen of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants was dead whereas the viability of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutant pollen did not differ from that of the wild type . to confirm that the striking pollen phenotype of the double knockout was caused by mutation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and not by any other reason we also generated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by crossing _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ . the homozygous knockout plants were identified using genomic dna pcr . we found a similar level of reduction in the pollen viability of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to that of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . as both _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants exhibited a similar phenotype we used _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant plants for further analysis . the reduced pollen viability of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants was recovered by introducing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the pollen viability of lines and was completely recovered to wild type levels whereas that of line was partially recovered . the recovery levels of the phenotype in complementation lines matched well with the _METHOD_ intensity from _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the anthers lines with high levels of _METHOD_ intensity in the anthers exhibited high recovery rates in pollen viability . to examine whether the manifestation of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen phenotype depends on environmental conditions two different phenotypic tests were conducted . first pollen viability was tested again under humidity conditions much higher than those in our greenhouse . the plants were grown in a chamber of intermediate humidity until flowering and then half were transferred to to humidity conditions and the other half to humidity conditions . within week pollen viability was assayed for pollen collected from open flowers . while the pollen viability of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was only under to humidity it recovered to under humidity . the pollen viability of the wild type was higher than in both conditions . cold shock is another environmental stress that affects pollen viability and consequently seed yield . we investigated the viability of wild type and _PROTEIN_ pollen after cold treatment . the viability of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ single knockout pollen was reduced to by cold treatment whereas that of wild type pollen was barely affected . the _PROTEIN_ in mutant pollen viability under cold stress suggests that cold shock might also reduce the seed yield of the mutants . to test this possibility wild type single knockout and double knockout plants were grown in the greenhouse for weeks and half of each genotype was incubated at for d and returned to the greenhouse . the siliques from the cold shock treated and nontreated plants were harvested after weeks . under normal conditions all genotypes of plants tested produced as many as seeds per silique indicating that fertilization was normal in the mutant plants . this is most likely due to the large excess of pollen grains compared with the number of ovules thus all of the mutant ovules were fertilized even when about half of the pollen grains were dead . cold treatment _PROTEIN_ the seed yield of all plants . however the seed yield of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants was reduced to the greatest extent and corresponded to only to of that obtained from wild type and single knockout plants . the specific _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in stamens suggested by the in silico database was confirmed by quantitative rt pcr analysis promoter _PROTEIN_ assays and _METHOD_ tagged protein localization . _PROTEIN_ transcripts were detected by qrt pcr _PROTEIN_ in the flowers and siliques but were barely detectable in vegetative tissues . _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were high between stages and of flower development and then declined during the _PROTEIN_ stages . this finding is in good agreement with data from the in silico microarray database showing that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ peaks at stages and and then _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to confirm this result a promoter gus construct was produced by fusing the kb fragment directly upstream of the _PROTEIN_ start codon to the gus reporter gene . in the transgenic plants a gus signal was found in the anthers and developing siliques . when the siliques were cleared the _PROTEIN_ region of the developing seeds was also found to exhibit a gus signal which matches the in silico data . in young seedlings of plants the gus signal was not detected . next _PROTEIN_ localization in anther tissue was examined in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ that had been used for the complementation assay . interestingly _METHOD_ signal occurred mostly in the tapetal cell layer . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signal appeared not only in a spatially specific manner but also in a temporally specific manner . the signal was apparent from the microspore stage until tapetum degeneration but not during earlier or _PROTEIN_ stages . _PROTEIN_ transcripts were detected in all tissues but were most abundant in flowers at stages to when _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was also high . to observe the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ in flowers _PROTEIN_ promoter gus assays were performed . the fragment comprising the region from kb upstream of the _PROTEIN_ start codon to the second exon was fused to gus . in the flowers of transgenic plants the gus signal was found _PROTEIN_ in the anthers . the gus signal from developing siliques was in the maternal tissues of siliques but not in the seed itself . semithin sections of anthers revealed that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in the pollen and tapetum of anthers from the tetrad stage to the tapetal degeneration stage and in the pollen at the mature stage . the gus signal was most prominent at the unicellular stage and was much higher in the tapetum than in the pollen . in young seedlings the patterns of gus _PROTEIN_ were variable even between individual plants of a single line about two thirds of the lines examined displayed the signal _PROTEIN_ in the whole shoots including the vasculature and most lines exhibited signal in the root vasculature even though the _PROTEIN_ levels varied . when the signal was weaker the _PROTEIN_ was more restricted to the tips of cotyledons and the basal parts of leaf petioles . _PROTEIN_ was previously reported to be involved in abscisic acid signaling . such variation in gus pattern in the _PROTEIN_ gus lines is possibly due to differences in the aba response . together these _PROTEIN_ assays for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ revealed that the tissue specific _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ matched that of _PROTEIN_ in the developing anther and was consistent with information from the in silico coexpression database supporting the possibility that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ participate in a similar process . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have no putative targeting sequences known to direct the proteins to any intracellular compartment and are predicted to localize to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to determine the precise intracellular localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter in nicotiana benthamiana cells using an agroinfiltration method . the protoplasts isolated from leaves transformed with either _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ exhibited green _METHOD_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . next _PROTEIN_ localization in anther tissue was examined in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis plants used for the complementation assay . interestingly _METHOD_ signal was found exclusively in the tapetal cell layer and was localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ which is consistent with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization found in cells transformed with constructs driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . scanning electron microscopy images of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen revealed no alteration in exine patterns suggesting that the pollen walls are normal and are not the cause of the pollen shriveling or _PROTEIN_ in viability . as we did not observe any defects in pollen development we suspected that the pollen coat was defective and thus might have caused the defects in pollen . we tested this possibility using transmission electron microscopy . just before anthesis at the time when flowers bear mature pollen grains the overall external appearance of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen did not differ from that of the wild type . however differences were apparent in the pollen coat . in the wild type the pollen coat of mature pollen grains was fully filled between neighboring baculae which are column like structures of sexine . in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants however the pollen coat was not completely filled and often was interspersed with vesicular or linear electron lucent structures . this irregular coat structure of the double knockout pollen resembled that of the immature pollen of the wild type at the beginning stage of pollen coat accumulation which also contained similar electron lucent structures . the unusual structures we found in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen coat may reflect reduced pollen coat contents or altered pollen coat composition in the mutant . as the pollen coat _PROTEIN_ consists of sterols especially steryl ester we performed sterol analysis using whole pollen grains . although we expected that the mutant would have a reduced steryl ester content the difference in free sterol and steryl ester contents between wild type and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen was not significant . by contrast we found that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen contained only about half of the amount of steryl glycosides present in wild type or single knockout mutant pollen . another component enriched in the pollen coat is wax . however the wax contents of wild type and double knockout mutant pollen did not differ much at and dry weight respectively . furthermore the mutant pollen did not differ from wild type pollen in the level of brassinosteroids steroid hormones that are greatly enriched in pollen with values of and pg/mg dry weight for wild type and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen respectively . in arabidopsis the biosynthesis of steryl glycosides is catalyzed _PROTEIN_ by two _LOCATION_ bound udp _PROTEIN_ sterol glycosyltransferases _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . recently citation generated a double knockout mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and showed that the mutant had significantly less steryl glycoside in the leaves _METHOD_ inflorescences and siliques . if the reduced steryl glycoside content in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant pollen was the underlying cause for the reduction in pollen viability the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant which is deficient in steryl glycoside biosynthesis should also display a similar phenotype . to test this possibility we performed a pollen viability assay under normal growth conditions and found that like the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant pollen exhibited reduced viability . moreover we found that the pollen coat of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant was often incomplete containing vesicular or linear electron lucent structures more frequently than that of the wild type although the defects were not as prominent as in pollen of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant .
