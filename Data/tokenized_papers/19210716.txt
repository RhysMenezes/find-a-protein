_PROTEIN_ transporters are involved in the transport of iron zinc and other divalent metal cations . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ transporter is higher in the zn/cadmium hyperaccumulator arabidopsis halleri than is that of its ortholog in arabidopsis thaliana which implies a positive association of its _PROTEIN_ with zn accumulation in a. halleri . _PROTEIN_ genes from both a. halleri and a. thaliana functionally complemented the zn uptake mutant in schizosaccharomyces pombe and zn uptake double mutant mutant and conferred zn and fe uptake activity in saccharomyces cerevisiae . by contrast the manganese uptake mutant phenotypes were not rescued . insufficient cd uptake for toxicity was found . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion proteins in arabidopsis root protoplasts indicated localization of both _PROTEIN_ proteins in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . overexpressing _PROTEIN_ in a. thaliana led to increased accumulation of zn in the shoot and fe in the root of transgenic lines . therefore _PROTEIN_ functions as a zn and transporter in arabidopsis .
to characterize the _PROTEIN_ in a. halleri cdna corresponding to _PROTEIN_ was cloned by from leaf tissues of a. halleri ssp . gemmifera . primers were designed according to the sequence of the _PROTEIN_ coding region for the amplification of cdna . the and sequences were obtained by use of _PROTEIN_ as described in the materials and methods section . the deduced amino acid sequence of was amino acids . contains eight predicted transmembrane domains similar to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and a putative domain with high similarity to _PROTEIN_ and . the amino acid residue in _PROTEIN_ suggested to be responsible for zn transport is conserved in but the and residue of _PROTEIN_ is not conserved in . sequence alignment of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and indicated that protein has the highest sequence homology to _PROTEIN_ protein apart from a deletion in the . the phylogenetic tree of available _PROTEIN_ and irt gene sequences revealed all known irt or _PROTEIN_ genes from both a. halleri and a. thaliana clustered together as pairs . it also showed that the _PROTEIN_ and the transporters _PROTEIN_ belong to distinct phylogenetic clades . by contrast _PROTEIN_ clustered closely with _PROTEIN_ and several znt transporter genes from thlaspi species which implies that _PROTEIN_ may be functionally more related to zn transporters . as a first step for the functional characterization of _PROTEIN_ proteins we tested whether _PROTEIN_ genes can complement s. pombe and s. cerevisiae mutants . both _PROTEIN_ and complemented the zn uptake deficiency of a s. pombe mutant strain disrupted in . unlike mutant cells carrying the empty vector cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or were able to grow at low external zn concentrations supplied in regular media . to further examine the uptake activity of other metals we also tested whether _PROTEIN_ genes can complement other s. cerevisiae mutants . as shown in fig . both _PROTEIN_ and complement the zn double mutant as efficiently as does _PROTEIN_ . interestingly both _PROTEIN_ genes can complement at low ph but not at high ph conditions . neither _PROTEIN_ nor confers the ability to take up mn thus unable to complement the mutant . when _PROTEIN_ in a strain in contrast to the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ no toxicity phenotype was seen in yeast cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and in the presence of cd . thus _PROTEIN_ genes from both arabidopsis species function similarly in yeast and are potential zn and fe transporters . however the fe transport activity of _PROTEIN_ and is much less than or different from that of _PROTEIN_ . following yeast complementation studies we tested _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in s. cerevisiae for their uptake activity . we performed the uptake experiments in the presence of zn as a substrate . _PROTEIN_ and zn uptake was low at the ph condition used but still significantly different from that of the empty vector control . _PROTEIN_ was used as a positive control . the zn uptake activity of _PROTEIN_ and was comparable to that mediated by _PROTEIN_ for min after the addition of zn . on the basis of complementation results to investigate fe uptake ability of the two heterologously _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ proteins we tested competition by fe in comparison with that in _PROTEIN_ . figure shows that uptake was strongly inhibited with fe by c. for all three proteins tested . the uptake ability of _PROTEIN_ and and fe inhibition of the uptake further support the proteins abilities in the uptake of zn and fe in yeast . more detailed kinetic analyses are needed to reveal the full biochemical properties of these two transporters but these are currently beyond the scope of the present study . to characterize the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ proteins in plant cells chimeric genes encoding a _METHOD_ fusion of _PROTEIN_ and proteins were constructed . the recombinant dna was purified and transfected into a. thaliana root protoplasts for transient _PROTEIN_ . the _METHOD_ signals for both constructs of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were enriched on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ whereas _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ remained only in the cytoplasm . together with yeast complementation data this finding suggests that both _PROTEIN_ proteins function as zn and transporters in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . using we investigated the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ genes in both a. thaliana and a. halleri under different zn and fe conditions . in general the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was higher in a. halleri than in a. thaliana . under normal conditions was _PROTEIN_ approx . threefold higher than _PROTEIN_ in both root and shoot tissues . both _PROTEIN_ and could be induced under conditions and repressed by excess zn . moreover under conditions _PROTEIN_ in a. thaliana was induced to a substantially higher level in shoots than roots reaching an _PROTEIN_ level similar to or higher than that of in a. halleri . this zn regulation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is consistent between a. halleri ssp . gemmifera and a. halleri ssp . halleri . to examine the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ a bp fragment upstream of _PROTEIN_ containing the putative promoter region of intergenic sequences and partial was fused with a gus reporter gene for transforming a. thaliana . among transgenic lines checked nine lines showed gus activity . one of the nine lines showed weak gus activity . the gus staining indicated that the _PROTEIN_ promoter was constitutively _PROTEIN_ in all tissues and at all stages . histochemical studies revealed that gus activity was downregulated under excess zn and upregulated under zn deficiency in seven _PROTEIN_ gus transgenic plants but not in gus transgenic plants and one of eight lines with strong gus activity . although gus activities of plants grown under different zn conditions do not differ greatly the data suggest that transcriptional regulation may be involved in the differential _PROTEIN_ transcript accumulation in response to environmental zn availability . detailed cytohistology confirmed the ubiquitous activity of the _PROTEIN_ promoter in all living cell types in leaf including guard cells and trichomes . a similar phenomenon was also observed in the root and root hairs . the _PROTEIN_ promoter was especially active in root stele and gus activity was clear in passage cells . from the results described we conclude that _PROTEIN_ and share qualitatively comparable biochemical properties in metal transport . to investigate whether the high _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ contributes to high accumulation of zn we constructed a. thaliana transgenic lines heterologously overexpressing _PROTEIN_ driven by a promoter . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the root and shoot of four transgenic lines was confirmed by . the transgenic lines showed no obvious phenotype . the dry weight of these transgenic lines did not significantly change under zn treatments . metal content analysis indicated that roots in all four lines accumulated zn levels similar to that of the when grown in the normal condition . two lines and with relatively high _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ accumulated substantially higher levels of zn in shoots than did the wild type . intriguingly the level of fe was markedly higher in the roots of all transgenic lines than in roots . the concentrations of additional divalent essential metals mn cu mo mg and ca were also comparable in the root and shoot of and transgenic lines . taken together these data indicate that the increased _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ specifically resulted in high levels of zn accumulation in the shoot and fe accumulation in the root without affecting the accumulation of mn cu mo mg or ca .
