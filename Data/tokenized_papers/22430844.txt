the plant _LOCATION_ plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of cell wall _PROTEIN_ polysaccharides protein glycosylation and vesicle trafficking . _LOCATION_ localized proteins have become prospective targets for reengineering cell wall biosynthetic pathways for the efficient production of _PROTEIN_ from plant cell walls . however proteomic characterization of the _LOCATION_ has so far been limited owing to the technical _PROTEIN_ inherent in _LOCATION_ purification . in this study a combination of density centrifugation and surface charge separation techniques have allowed the reproducible isolation of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ from arabidopsis at sufficiently high purity levels for in depth proteomic analysis . quantitative proteomic analysis immunoblotting enzyme activity assays and electron microscopy all confirm high purity levels . a composition analysis indicated that approximately of proteins were likely derived from contaminating compartments and ribosomes . the localization of newly assigned proteins to the _LOCATION_ using transient _METHOD_ markers further validated the proteome . a collection of proteins consistently identified in all replicates has been proposed to represent the _LOCATION_ proteome marking an appreciable advancement in numbers of _LOCATION_ localized proteins . a significant proportion of proteins likely involved in _PROTEIN_ polysaccharide biosynthesis were identified . the potential within this proteome for advances in understanding _LOCATION_ processes has been demonstrated by the identification and functional characterization of the first plant _LOCATION_ resident nucleoside diphosphatase using a yeast complementation assay . overall these data show key proteins involved in primary cell wall synthesis and include a mixture of well characterized and unknown proteins whose biological roles and importance as targets for future research can now be realized .
enzymatic digestion of cell walls permits the delicate homogenization of arabidopsis cells which increases the structural preservation of organelles released during cell rupture . this is paramount in the case of the _LOCATION_ whose heterogeneous structure had contributed to experimental difficulties historically encountered during attempts at its isolation . low speed centrifugation removed denser contaminants such as _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the majority of mitochondria . _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in the resulting supernatant were further enriched using established density centrifugation techniques . relative enrichment for _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ versus contaminants during this process was tracked using the cis _LOCATION_ marker mannosidase i . with the exception of the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ major contaminants were depleted during centrifugation prior to analysis by ffe as observed in the pre ffe fraction by immunoblotting . however despite the reduction in contamination shown by immunoblotting liquid chromatography tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis and quantification by spectral counting of the m interface showed a continued presence of contaminants of those for which a subcellular location could be confidently ascertained from organelle marker proteins were identified as contaminants and only as _LOCATION_ localized indicating that further purification was required for reliable proteomic analysis of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the enriched _LOCATION_ fraction from the m suc interface was loaded at the anode injection port of the ffe device . fractions were collected on well plates combined and concentrated by ultracentrifugation . highly purified post ffe _LOCATION_ fractions were determined by analyzing approximately fractions by lc _METHOD_ and profiling the identified proteins using organelle marker proteins . due to numerous technical considerations slight variations in migration occur between experiments although profiles enable accurate estimations for profiling by lc _METHOD_ . the post ffe _LOCATION_ purified fractions comprised two to three sequential fractions which contained abundant _LOCATION_ markers and minimal contaminating proteins . the efficacy of ffe as an orthogonal enrichment strategy is evident from the _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and the striking increase in mani in the highly enriched post ffe fraction . no significant changes were observed in the proportion of contaminants protein synthesis proteins or transitory proteins _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ based on their relative abundances . significantly among proteins of definable subcellular locations the proportion of experimentally determined _LOCATION_ proteins dramatically increased after ffe while contaminants and transients _PROTEIN_ from and to and respectively . protein synthesis proteins showed a smaller decline from to . the electrophoretic migration of _LOCATION_ and principal contaminants _LOCATION_ was also monitored by immunoblotting . as predicted from the electrophoretic migration of mammalian _LOCATION_ plant _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were marginally more electronegative than many of the other contaminating _LOCATION_ . accordingly the cis _LOCATION_ marker mani was detected in more anodic fractions peaking at fraction . signal intensity for the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ and the mitochondrial marker porin _PROTEIN_ was greater across fractions to and to respectively . _PROTEIN_ nucleoside diphosphatase activity a frequently used _LOCATION_ marker was used to further assess purity after ffe . around five fractions were pooled and assayed . an approximately fold increase was observed between whole cell lysates and the pooled post ffe fractions while an approximately fold increase was identified between post low speed centrifugation and the pooled post ffe fractions . taken together these data demonstrate substantial _LOCATION_ enrichment from whole cell fractions by a combination of successive density centrifugation and ffe . _PROTEIN_ of the structural integrity of _LOCATION_ derived vesicles was important as vesicle orientation affects migration during electrophoresis . the structure of the _LOCATION_ apparatus was tracked throughout the purification procedure using electron microscopy . protoplasts derived from d old cells appeared healthy and contained numerous _LOCATION_ stacks . _LOCATION_ stacks are fragile typically only remaining intact during density centrifugation if low concentrations of glutaraldehyde are added to homogenization buffers . cisternae in loosely aggregated stacks were observed in the homogenate in close proximity to densely staining structures of similar dimensions to individual cisternae suggesting that some unstacking was occurring despite the gentle homogenization technique . the presence of partially unstacked cisternae implies that loss of cisternal structure was not widespread despite the loss of stack macroarchitecture . the _LOCATION_ enriched fraction centrifuged onto the m suc cushion was rich in mitochondria and also contained densely staining membranous structures of to in length . due to technical constraints immunogold labeling of these structures was not possible and hence unequivocal identification of these structures as cisternae was not undertaken but similarities in dimensions and appearance to the loosely stacked cisternae and previously isolated plant _LOCATION_ cisternae strongly supported the cisternal nature of these structures . the m suc interface also contained many densely staining membranous structures . immunoblotting and enzyme assays indicated that this fraction was _LOCATION_ enriched so it is likely that these structures were _LOCATION_ derived . some of these membranous structures resembled those observed on the suc cushion while others were present in loops of to diameter . small bulbous swellings at the ends of the unlooped structures or along the perimeter of looped structures were suggestive of two membranous structures fused together at their ends . fractions from post ffe analyses contained a dilute but homogenous collection of similar structures of approximately to in diameter . as these fractions represented the most _LOCATION_ enriched fractions after ffe it is likely that these are disassociated _LOCATION_ stacks . the morphology of individual vesicles was not sufficiently clear to show whether these structures were formed from looped swollen or ruptured and reformed cisternae . the analyses outlined above indicated that the ffe could deliver sufficiently highly purified _LOCATION_ samples for proteomic characterization by _METHOD_ data were collected from three distinct biological preparations after ffe separation of plant _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the three independent separations produced very similar profiles to those outlined previously . to precisely determine the purified _LOCATION_ fractions after ffe analysis fractions from the _LOCATION_ enriched region were each concentrated by ultracentrifugation and analyzed by lc _METHOD_ . marker proteins from previous organelle proteomic surveys were used to identify the contiguous fractions that contained a significant enrichment of _LOCATION_ proteins with minimal contaminants . each fraction enriched for _LOCATION_ markers was selected for further in depth analysis by lc _METHOD_ and interrogated against the arabidopsis information resource release protein data set . the contributions of each biological replicate analyzed by lc _METHOD_ were as follows atgolgi atgolgi and atgolgi which excluded redundant protein matches . combining all three analyses a total of distinct proteins were identified . protein matches were required to have been identified in at least two replicates with a distinct identification in one replicate to be assigned with confidence to the final proteome . this resulted in a set of proteins and defined a reproducible arabidopsis _LOCATION_ proteome . proteins that had fulfilled the above criteria but were not unambiguously identified in at least one preparation were removed . although excluded from the final set these proteins still represent potentially valid identifications although most are derived from alternate splice transcripts . in an attempt to further define the proteins comprising the reproducible arabidopsis _LOCATION_ proteome we exploited the extensive subcellular proteomics that has already been undertaken in arabidopsis . using these data it was possible to directly assign contaminants based on extensive experimental localization data . a total of proteins were assigned as organelle contaminants using this approach with a further assigned to the protein synthesis classification based on experimental annotations . specific organelle contaminants comprised _LOCATION_ the _LOCATION_ the _LOCATION_ and six proteins from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ collectively . using quantitative spectral counting techniques the relative contribution of contaminants was estimated at of the identified proteome and protein synthesis proteins at . functional analysis of the remaining proteins showed a significant proportion of proteins with no distinct functional role suggesting further diverse roles for the _LOCATION_ apparatus . significantly the largest functional group was proteins involved in sugar metabolism a major function of the plant _LOCATION_ apparatus . this group includes over _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ like proteins many of which have been determined to be involved in _PROTEIN_ polysaccharide biosynthesis . this was followed by transporters and associated proteins transferases trafficking proteins and a group involved in protein _PROTEIN_ functions . of the proteins identified in the _LOCATION_ proteome a total of had been previously localized to the _LOCATION_ or endomembrane by either proteomics or _METHOD_ protein localization . when dealing with a secretory pathway it is important but sometimes difficult to distinguish transitory proteins destined for elsewhere from functionally active resident proteins . abundant experimental evidence exists for the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization of a proportion of proteins identified in this study . within the set of proteins proteins were classified as transitory based on whether they had been repeatedly identified in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ . proteins with multiple demonstrated locations such as members of the cellulose synthase _PROTEIN_ or _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ synthase _PROTEIN_ complex were excluded . this provided strong evidence that proteins or of total proteins were in transit through the _LOCATION_ apparatus . we attempted to correlate the distribution of proteins presented in this study with distribution patterns shown by known _LOCATION_ markers during ffe so that a confidence rank for _LOCATION_ localization could be assigned to each of the proteins . this way _LOCATION_ localization versus contamination could be assessed per protein a more useful approach than assigning all proteins of uncertain location to the _LOCATION_ using a single confidence bracket . two further independent _LOCATION_ preparations were undertaken to produce the necessary resolution for the proteomic analysis of fractions for confidence assignments . a total of post ffe fractions were individually analyzed by lc _METHOD_ covering ffe fractions to . different abundance profiles of each protein over the fractions provided an estimate of similarity when compared with the distribution profiles of _LOCATION_ markers or known contaminants . based on this analysis a _LOCATION_ marker correlation rank was developed indicating low confidence or high confidence . only of the proteins reproducibly identified in the proteomic characterization of atgolgi atgolgi and atgolgi were unable to be allocated a confidence rank due to poor representation in these new analyses . significantly of these proteins were previously allocated as contaminants further highlighting the reproducibility of this approach . low scoring proteins in this set include many non _LOCATION_ proteins _PROTEIN_ while several of the highest scoring proteins have documented functions in the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . while these scores are helpful in assessing likely _LOCATION_ localization for a particular protein it is worth noting that this protein data set is derived from fractions already highly enriched in _LOCATION_ and a lower score is not necessarily indicative of contamination _PROTEIN_ has been previously localized to the _LOCATION_ but receives a low confidence rank of compared with nontransitory proposed _LOCATION_ proteins . the success of the ffe approach for the purification of _LOCATION_ was further examined by confirming the localization of a collection of proteins using c terminal yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusions . a total of proteins were selected that had been allocated to the _LOCATION_ proteome in this study . the selected proteins had a range of confidence values protein scores and various subcellular assignments by _METHOD_ . transient transformation assays were undertaken and after overnight incubation of the _METHOD_ constructs resulted in signals corresponding to punctate structures within the cell . a cotransformed _LOCATION_ marker _METHOD_ _METHOD_ confirmed the cis _LOCATION_ identity of these punctate structures . a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization signal was also observed for three proteins acc oxidase _PROTEIN_ a putative nucleotide sugar transporter _PROTEIN_ and an protein _PROTEIN_ and could indicate multiple localizations of these proteins in the secretory system . significantly a dehydration stress protein allocated as a transient protein in the _LOCATION_ proteome was localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ confirming its presence in the _LOCATION_ as a transient or cargo protein . finally of the proteins previously allocated to the _LOCATION_ by _METHOD_ were identified in this proteome . the exceptionally high overlap of proteins assigned to the _LOCATION_ in these studies together with the other validation techniques outlined above support the quality of the ffe purification process in isolating high purity _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ from plants . to highlight the potential functional significance of this data set we selected a candidate that had been extensively characterized in roles unrelated to functions within the plant _LOCATION_ apparatus . the _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ is reported to be a member of the plant apyrase family and to function as an ectoapyrase at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . previous work using recombinant _PROTEIN_ has indicated that the enzyme functions as an apyrase and is capable of hydrolyzing both _PROTEIN_ and adp . the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ was confirmed using a _METHOD_ marker . these previous activity data together with the confirmed subcellular information indicated that _PROTEIN_ may function as an ndpase converting nucleoside diphosphates formed after glycosylation reactions to nucleotides within the _LOCATION_ apparatus . to ascertain whether _PROTEIN_ could function as an ndpase in vivo a complementation assay was undertaken . the saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant lacks the _LOCATION_ guanosine diphosphatase gene and results in the partial loss of o and n glycosylation of proteins . the _PROTEIN_ gene was transformed into the and wild type backgrounds to determine whether it could functionally complement the reduced glycosylation phenotype by detecting the recovery of protein glycosylation through immunoblotting . the effect of the mutant on the mobility of the _PROTEIN_ y protein by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type confirmed the reduced glycosylation in this mutant . transformation of the mutant with the _PROTEIN_ gene construct successfully complemented the reduced glycosylation phenotype . these results confirm the ability of the _PROTEIN_ product to function as an ndpase in the secretory system of s. cerevisiae .
