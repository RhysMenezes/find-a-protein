cellular signaling through protein tyrosine phosphorylation is well established in mammalian cells . although lacking the classic tyrosine kinases present in humans plants have a tyrosine phospho proteome that rivals human cells . here we report a novel plant tyrosine phosphatase from arabidopsis thaliana that surprisingly has the sequence hallmarks of a phospho serine/threonine phosphatase belonging to the _PROTEIN_ family . rhizobiales/rhodobacterales/rhodospirillaceae like phosphatases are conserved in plants and several other eukaryotes but not in animals . we demonstrate that is localized to the plant cell _LOCATION_ is resistant to the classic serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid and microcystin but is inhibited by the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor orthovanadate and is particularly sensitive to inhibition by the adenylates _PROTEIN_ and adp . displays remarkable selectivity toward tyrosine phosphorylated peptides versus serine/threonine phospho peptides and readily dephosphorylates a classic tyrosine phosphatase protein substrate suggesting that in vivo it is a tyrosine phosphatase . to date only one other tyrosine phosphatase is known in plants thus represents one of the missing pieces in the plant tyrosine phosphatase repertoire and supports the concept of protein tyrosine phosphorylation as a key regulatory event in plants .
previous bioinformatic analysis determined to be found widely across photosynthetic eukaryotes where it was predicted to have a _LOCATION_ localization . to confirm its subcellular localization and tissue _PROTEIN_ we generated and affinity purified antibodies to recombinant . this antibody could detect as little as ng of tagged and detected a protein in crude extracts at the predicted _METHOD_ of the endogenous . this band was confirmed to be by demonstrating its disappearance in two separate knock out lines neither of which displayed any obvious growth phenotype . western blotting of a. thaliana tissues demonstrated protein _PROTEIN_ in all tissues examined . to explore subcellular localization _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ fractions were prepared from both rosettes and cell culture . blotting each fraction with _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ marker proteins revealed a _LOCATION_ localization for . consistent with cell fractionation and bioinformatics immunolocalization imaging of cultured a. thaliana cells revealed that is _LOCATION_ and excluded from the _LOCATION_ . identical results were found in a. thaliana roots . no signal was observed when the knock out line was used supporting the notion that the anti signal observed in fig . a and m is derived solely from antibody binding . the immunoreactive band of kda observed during western blotting is likely an epitope only exposed once proteins are denatured in _PROTEIN_ . blotting with _PROTEIN_ igg gave no signal for roots or cell culture . poly his tagged was _PROTEIN_ and purified from e. coli . size exclusion chromatography revealed a monomer of kda despite a denatured _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ of kda . was found to have a ph optimum of with a specific activity of nmol pi toward the artificial phosphatase substrate pnpp . screening of known metal cation co _PROTEIN_ of various protein and non protein phosphatases showed no stimulation of phosphatase activity with highest activity observed in the control condition containing mm edta . interestingly inhibited the phosphatase activity of just as is the most potent metal ion inhibitor of human classic tyrosine phosphatases . several phosphate containing compounds and classic protein phosphatase inhibitors were evaluated for their inhibitory effect on . phosphate analogs naf and are _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ family protein phosphatase specific small molecule inhibitors respectively . both naf and substantially reduced activity with values of mm and respectively . additionally the naturally occurring _PROTEIN_ family protein phosphatase specific small molecule inhibitors okadaic acid and microcystin lr were also examined for their inhibitory effect on . concentrations that would completely inhibit the _PROTEIN_ family member _PROTEIN_ failed to have any inhibitory effect on . also exhibited nanomolar _PROTEIN_ sensitivity in addition to micromolar to millimolar sensitivity to adp pi and amp as well as remarkable sensitivity to _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ phosphate and glycerol phosphate had no notable inhibitory effect on activity up to a mm concentration . utilizing ser thr and tyr phospho peptides to decipher the substrate preferences of _PROTEIN_ family members _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and classic _PROTEIN_ has previously been employed successfully . therefore using a panel of phosphorylated peptides consisting of pser pthr and ptyr the substrate specificity of was evaluated . exhibited low activity toward pser and pthr only peptides but displayed typically fold greater activity against ptyr containing peptides . no measurable activity was detected when employing the non phospho peptide substrates phospho enolpyruvate amp adp _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ datp dihydroxyacetone phosphate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ p and glycerol p. among the a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ family enzymes we recently characterized the other bacteria like phosphatases shewanella like protein phosphatases _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . for comparison bacterially _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was assayed in parallel with to assess its preference for pser pthr and ptyr peptides . unlike _PROTEIN_ exhibited a broad specificity profile for phospho peptide substrates effectively dephosphorylating pser pthr and ptyr peptides . next we performed assays to determine kinetic parameters toward a pser pthr and ptyr peptide . to allow a direct comparison we selected the peptide and also synthesized the same peptide with pser or pthr in place of the ptyr residue . due to the extremely low activity with the pser and pthr peptides no reliable km or kcat values could be determined . however using the ptyr containing peptide we determined a kcat value of and a km of . next we employed tap of overexpressed in planta constructed _PROTEIN_ and to verify these phospho peptide substrate preferences . using equal amounts of enzyme ctap displayed little to no detectable activity toward a pthr containing peptide but still robustly dephosphorylated a ptyr peptide whereas _PROTEIN_ ctap still _PROTEIN_ measurable phosphatase activity toward the ptyr peptide but with a marked preference for the pthr containing peptide . to further support this observation we next immunoprecipitated the endogenous from wild type plant cell culture for in vitro assays and again the enzyme displayed a remarkable preference for ptyr peptides . the human tyrosine kinase fer _METHOD_ autophosphorylates on tyrosine residues when _PROTEIN_ in bacteria . this makes it an excellent substrate for human classic _PROTEIN_ . we purified the bacterially _PROTEIN_ auto phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ fer kinase and used it in an assay with immunoprecipitated . as shown in fig . c and d readily dephosphorylated the ptyr protein again supporting the notion that in vivo is a tyrosine phosphatase .
