development of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ depends upon the transport of _LOCATION_ vesicles from the chloroplast inner envelope and subsequent fusion of vesicles within the interior of the _LOCATION_ . the arabidopsis _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ gene product is shown here to control an important step required for the normal organization of these vesicles into mature _LOCATION_ stacks and ultimately for leaf development . the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ gene encodes an imported chloroplast protein as shown by in vitro import and localization of a _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein fusion product in transgenic plants . this gene is conserved in oxygenic photoautotrophs ranging from cyanobacteria to flowering land plants . transcript levels for _PROTEIN_ are induced in the light and _PROTEIN_ under dark conditions paralleling profiles of light regulated _LOCATION_ genes involved in chloroplast function . disruption of the _PROTEIN_ gene via t dna insertion results in plants that are severely stunted with variegated leaf patterns . nongreen sectors of variegated leaves lacking _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ contain _LOCATION_ that accumulate _LOCATION_ vesicles on the interior and lack organized _LOCATION_ structures . green sectors of _PROTEIN_ disrupted leaves contain some chloroplasts that form organized _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ indicating that an inefficient compensatory mechanism supports _LOCATION_ formation in the absence of _PROTEIN_ . genetic complementation of a _PROTEIN_ knockout line _METHOD_ the role of this gene in chloroplast and leaf development . transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ gene in antisense orientation are stunted with altered _LOCATION_ organization especially in young seedlings . the data indicate that the _PROTEIN_ gene product plays a crucial role in a dynamic process of vesicle mediated _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ biogenesis .
a cdna clone for an apparent ortholog of the arabidopsis _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ gene was originally isolated from potato and identified as a light regulated gene . the apparent ubiquitous nature of this gene in plants along with the presence of a conserved strong coiled coil motif made it an interesting candidate for further study . a cdna encoding arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ was amplified using reverse transcription pcr based on the sequence of a full length cdna listed in the genbank database . analysis of the arabidopsis genome indicates that this is a single copy gene without a closely related sequence in the remainder of the genome . the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by _PROTEIN_ suggests the presence of a chloroplast transit signal at the amino terminus and a coiled coil domain near the _PROTEIN_ terminus in a hydrophilic protein of kd . the predicted size of a fully processed _PROTEIN_ protein in chloroplasts is kd . a search of the genbank database with the predicted amino acid sequence yielded several full length entries with a high degree of similarity to _PROTEIN_ . with one exception all of the sequences similar to _PROTEIN_ were found in photosynthetic _METHOD_ ranging from cyanobacteria to land plants . a predicted protein with similarity to the _PROTEIN_ sequence in the overlapping region has also been identified in a large double stranded dna virus that infects freshwater green algae . not surprisingly measurement of similarities among the available full length sequences shows that amino acid sequences encoded in arabidopsis rice and potato are more similar to each other than to sequences of the corresponding clones from cyanobacteria or the virus . identification of highly similar _PROTEIN_ sequence tags from tomato soybean sunflower barley maize and medicago truncatula indicates the presence of _PROTEIN_ like genes in numerous other plant species . the presence of a putative transit signal on _PROTEIN_ led us to examine intact chloroplasts for the ability to import the protein . radiolabeled _PROTEIN_ was efficiently imported into chloroplasts as judged by protease protection of the chloroplast localized protein . furthermore the labeled _PROTEIN_ was processed to the predicted size after cleavage of the transit peptide . fractionation of protease treated chloroplasts containing imported _PROTEIN_ showed that the protein is localized to both soluble stroma and _LOCATION_ . addition of the protease thermolysin to _LOCATION_ fractions results in the degradation of the bulk of _PROTEIN_ indicating that it is most likely bound at the periphery and not integrated into the lipid bilayer . this result is consistent with the absence of a predicted transmembrane region in the _PROTEIN_ sequence . however a weak signal for _PROTEIN_ remains in the thermolysin treated _LOCATION_ fraction suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is partially protected from protease treatment . localization of chloroplast proteins and was used as a measure of the effectiveness of fractionation . the lhcp protein is known to integrate into _LOCATION_ and is only partially accessible to added protease . the phosphate translocator protein is localized to the chloroplast inner envelope _LOCATION_ and the localization patterns for both imported lhcp and confirm that there was no contamination of soluble fractions with either _LOCATION_ or envelope _LOCATION_ fragments . both of the control proteins migrated on the gel at the predicted positions the size of the processed lhcp protein is kd and of the processed protein is kd . fusion of the _PROTEIN_ protein at the _PROTEIN_ terminus with green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ verified chloroplast localization of the protein in planta . to confirm the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ or chloroplasts we made the construct _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and transformed it into suspension cells and plants . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized in _LOCATION_ and stromules which seem to connect _LOCATION_ together . some stromules extended to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ indicating that communication might take place between the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . in mesophyll cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was distributed throughout the chloroplasts but predominantly in uneven patterns around the periphery perhaps associated with the chloroplast envelope . this result is consistent with the above in vitro assay . these data showed that _PROTEIN_ was localized not only in _LOCATION_ and chloroplasts but also in stromules . transcripts for _PROTEIN_ accumulate in leaves of plants grown under normal long daylight /dark conditions . leaves collected h into the light cycle contain abundant transcripts whereas transcript levels are greatly reduced in leaves from plants placed in complete darkness for h . transcript levels return to normal within h after plants are returned to normal light levels . alterations in _PROTEIN_ transcript levels closely parallel those of a characterized light regulated _LOCATION_ gene encoding a chloroplast protein _PROTEIN_ in response to light conditions . an arabidopsis line with a potential t dna insertion in the _PROTEIN_ gene was acquired after a search of the salk institute genomic analysis laboratory arabidopsis gene mapping database . seedlings were screened via pcr for the presence of a t dna insertion in chromosome within the gene designated _GENE_ . amplification of a specific band in several individual plants confirmed incorporation of the t dna in the _PROTEIN_ gene . we found no insertions in another plant line listed as having a t dna insertion at the same location . sequencing of the pcr products showed that the insertion was at nucleotide position in the _PROTEIN_ cdna near the end of exon . with the exception of one plant individuals that grew to maturity from the seed stock were indistinguishable from wild type arabidopsis ecotype columbia plants grown alongside . among the plants of normal appearance there was a mixture of pcr positive and negative individuals indicative of segregation of the t dna tag within the population . one plant designated was severely stunted with leaves containing green and yellow/white sectors . young seedlings of this line less than d old were yellow but as the plants aged they eventually began to develop interspersed green patches . although the timing was delayed line flowered and formed viable seed . when reciprocal crosses were made between line and wild type columbia plants the resulting progeny all grew normally and were indistinguishable from the wild type parent . segregation patterns in subsequent generations showed that the mutation leading to the abnormal leaf phenotype behaved as a single recessive gene . genomic dna blot analysis confirmed that line contained a unique restriction enzyme pattern when hybridized with a radiolabeled _PROTEIN_ cdna and compared to the other lines . the dna restriction profiles were consistent with line being homozygous for the t dna insertion whereas other pcr positive lines appeared to be heterozygous and pcr negative lines contained no t dna insertion . segregation patterns of the yellowed/stunted phenotype in seedlings derived by selfing pcr positive lines also indicate that is homozygous for the t dna insertion and that the other original lines are heterozygous . even upon prolonged exposure of leaf rna blots transcripts hybridizing to _PROTEIN_ appear to be completely absent in line whereas they are found at normal levels in the other arabidopsis lines tested . the profiles of transcripts for other light inducible _LOCATION_ encoded genes encoding chloroplast proteins such as _PROTEIN_ are not altered in indicating that the deficiency of _PROTEIN_ mrna is not due to a lesion affecting transcript accumulation for this class of genes . leaves containing a mixture of green and yellow sectors were used for rna extractions the results therefore show that even in normal appearing green sectors of line there is no _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . ultrastructural examination via transmission electron microscopy shows that some chloroplasts from green sectors of leaves in line appear to have normal _LOCATION_ development in _METHOD_ of abundance and structure . however many _LOCATION_ in the same tissue had reduced amounts of _LOCATION_ stacking and distances between grana stacks were greater than in wild type chloroplasts . although a few chloroplasts of relatively normal appearance were found most _LOCATION_ in yellow/white sectors of line lacked _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ grana or starch granules . however the envelope _LOCATION_ structure size and general shape of these _LOCATION_ appear to be normal . these _LOCATION_ accumulated numerous _LOCATION_ vesicles of varying sizes in the interior soluble region but the vesicles do not coalesce to form _LOCATION_ . the _PROTEIN_ cdna was integrated into the arabidopsis genome in both sense and antisense orientations under the control of a cauliflower mosaic virus promoter using agrobacterium mediated transformation . this allowed us to test whether changing levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ leads to altered leaf and/or chloroplast development . progeny of selfed transformed lines _PROTEIN_ the antisense _PROTEIN_ grew more slowly than offspring of plants transformed with either the sense construct or the binary vector alone . although they were initially smaller _PROTEIN_ antisense lines in short daylight ultimately grew to nearly equal size of the sense lines or vector transformed controls . we observed no differences in plant growth or development when comparing the progeny of independent selfed lines transformed with either the sense construct or the vector alone . when antisense plants were grown under long daylight conditions their leaves had a more wrinkled appearance and although they flowered they were smaller than control lines and formed less siliques . the overall size of _PROTEIN_ antisense lines was reduced compared to vector transformed control lines as indicated by smaller rosettes over the life of the plant . unlike the homozygous knockout mutant line the antisense lines did not always display yellow sectored leaves and when variegation appeared the phenotype was not as pronounced as in line . the level of _PROTEIN_ protein is severely reduced in antisense chloroplasts as indicated by immunoblot analysis . the time to bolting was also delayed in the antisense lines . the vector transformed control lines all bolted within d after planting whereas not all antisense lines bolted until d. the plants containing the antisense construct eventually developed normal flowers and viable seeds . when the knockout line was transformed with the _PROTEIN_ sense construct the resulting lines grew normally and transgenic lines accumulated high levels of _PROTEIN_ transcripts . this complementation _METHOD_ that disruption of the _PROTEIN_ gene leads to the severe phenotype observed in line . analysis of chloroplasts via tem of transgenic lines suggests that _LOCATION_ organization is severely affected in young plants transformed with the _PROTEIN_ antisense construct . although loosely organized _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ seem to form in d old antisense construct seedlings the chloroplasts lack normal grana stacks when compared to chloroplasts from control lines of the same age . abundant _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ accumulate in these chloroplasts but the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ is severely disrupted giving the interior a sponge like appearance . as the plants age chloroplasts in antisense lines take on a more normal appearance . however as in chloroplasts from the green sectors of the knockout line in antisense lines the grana stacks appear shorter and there is less starch granule accumulation . as in line tissues the structure and size of other cell components and organelles such as mitochondria appear normal in the sense and antisense lines .
