while _LOCATION_ transporters mediating ammonium uptake across the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ have been well described at the molecular level little is known about compartmentation and cellular export of ammonium . we therefore developed a yeast complementation approach and isolated two arabidopsis genes that conferred tolerance to the toxic ammonium analog methylammonium in yeast . both genes and encode aquaporins of the tonoplast intrinsic protein subfamily and transported methylammonium or ammonium in yeast preferentially at high medium ph . _PROTEIN_ in xenopus oocytes increased methylammonium accumulation with increasing ph . and mediated methylammonium detoxification in yeast depended on a functional _LOCATION_ which was in agreement with the subcellular localization of green _METHOD_ protein fusion proteins on the tonoplast in planta . transcript levels of both attips were influenced by nitrogen supply but did not follow those of the nitrogen derepressed ammonium transporter gene _PROTEIN_ . transgenic arabidopsis plants overexpressing did not show altered ammonium accumulation in roots after ammonium supply although mrna levels in wild type plants were up regulated under these conditions . this study shows that and can mediate the extracytosolic transport of methyl and across the tonoplast _LOCATION_ and may thus participate in _LOCATION_ ammonium compartmentation .
to isolate plant genes involved in ammonium export or compartmentation a yeast complementation strategy was designed . to avoid that an enhanced ammonium assimilatory capacity might increase the tolerance of yeast against excess ammonium ammonium was substituted by the toxic substrate analog methylammonium and supplied to the medium at ph . with increasing methylammonium concentrations the yeast wild type strain transformed with the empty vector _PROTEIN_ showed severe growth depression and completely failed to grow at mm methylammonium or above . when the yeast wild type strain which does not require the additional supplement of his leu and met was transformed with the empty vector or _PROTEIN_ it was even more sensitive to methylammonium resulting in a complete growth depression at mm methylammonium . transformation of with a cdna library from arabidopsis seedlings and screening of approximately transformants on mm methylammonium allowed us to repeatedly isolate two cdna clones and . encodes a functional _PROTEIN_ tonoplast located water channel that also transports urea . the gene product of is identical to and has not yet been functionally characterized . the exclusive isolation of _PROTEIN_ suggested that most efficient detoxification of methylammonium by _PROTEIN_ of plant genes in yeast is conferred by methylammonium export out of the cytoplasm to the apoplasm or into the _LOCATION_ . to investigate the contribution of the _LOCATION_ to methylammonium detoxification in yeast the _LOCATION_ defective yeast mutant was used . while growth of wild type yeast hardly showed any growth depression at methylammonium concentrations below mm growth of ceased dramatically above mm methylammonium suggesting that the _LOCATION_ increases the capacity for methylammonium detoxification in yeast . transformation of with or did not influence yeast growth relative to transformants with the control vector in the absence of methylammonium . under supply of to mm methylammonium however _PROTEIN_ of attips could not improve methylammonium tolerance in yeast as it was observed in wild type yeast irrespective of whether cells were grown at ph or at ph . this observation supported the notion that both proteins should exert their major function in conferring methylammonium tolerance at the tonoplast . it has been pointed out that heterologous _PROTEIN_ of plant _LOCATION_ proteins in yeast might bear the risk of a mislocalization of the gene product . we tried to take advantage of and gene products that might have been targeted accidentally to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in yeast by assaying their contribution to ph dependent uptake of external ammonium . _PROTEIN_ of and in the ammonium uptake defective yeast strain which grows poorly on low ammonium concentrations as a sole nitrogen source allowed growth complementation even at mm external ammonium indicating that both attips conferred substrate transport across the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . growth complementation however was observed only at ph or . at higher ammonium supply attip _PROTEIN_ further accelerated yeast growth and growth complementation always increased with ph . yeast cells transformed with the empty vector also showed better growth at high ph but always lagged behind that of attip transformed cells . by contrast ammonium transporter _PROTEIN_ mediated growth complementation was not affected by ph . this experiment suggested that ammonium uptake by both attip proteins mechanistically differs from that of _PROTEIN_ and occurs in the form of . as an independent approach to verify transport of methylammonium was _PROTEIN_ in oocytes and uptake of labeled methylammonium was measured in dependence of solution ph . methylammonium uptake into water injected oocytes similar to yeast increased with increasing ph and a concomitantly increased formation of methyl . at all ph values tested oocytes _PROTEIN_ showed a higher capacity for methylammonium transport and this transport capacity further increased with ph . since the concentration of methyl but not of methyl increased by a _PROTEIN_ of with each ph unit mediated substrate transport increased with the availability of the uncharged nitrogen form . heterologous _PROTEIN_ of and in both yeast and oocytes thus indicated that besides water and urea and methyl are novel substrates transported by _PROTEIN_ . transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ fusions in arabidopsis protoplasts yielded strongest _METHOD_ at the tonoplast and in small vesicular structures that were released after osmotic shock . a recent study employing stably overexpressed _METHOD_ confirmed tonoplast localization of . we thus generated transgenic plants for stable _PROTEIN_ of enhanced _METHOD_ _METHOD_ under control of a cauliflower mosaic virus promoter and investigated _METHOD_ by microscopy . dependent _METHOD_ appeared in roots as well as in shoot organs but was best visible in rhizodermal cells . _METHOD_ clearly localized on the tonoplast which has been exemplified by _METHOD_ around a _LOCATION_ . thus and are both primarily localized on the tonoplast in arabidopsis roots . gene _PROTEIN_ of and in roots was subjected to a strong diurnal regulation . mrna levels of both genes increased after onset of light peaked approximately at midday and declined to lowest levels already before offset of light . such a distinct diurnal regulation is typical for root transporter genes like those encoding amt transporters that are coregulated by photoassimilates or related metabolites from the shoots . subjecting hydroponically grown arabidopsis plants to nitrogen starvation initially _PROTEIN_ root transcript levels of . transcript levels oscillated during the experimental period but for both and no monophasic response to nitrogen deficiency was observed . this pattern of gene _PROTEIN_ was in agreement with the northern analysis of in citation but clearly different from the pattern observed for the nitrogen repressed ammonium transporter gene _PROTEIN_ for which mrna levels continuously increased with nitrogen deficiency . the oscillating changes in and mrna levels upon nitrogen starvation may also have been due to other regulatory _PROTEIN_ such as small changes in the osmotic potential of the roots . the distinct regulation from _PROTEIN_ suggested that induction or derepression of and is not a part of the nitrogen deficiency response in arabidopsis roots . in general gene _PROTEIN_ of major intrinsic proteins can be dramatically influenced by the water status of the plant and ammonium but in particular nitrate resupply might lead to a rapid change in root water uptake or in the hydraulic conductivity of roots due to their osmotic action besides their function as a nitrogen source . moreover the transfer of plants from nitrogen deficiency to exclusive supply of ammonium or nitrate is also accompanied by secondary effects such as _PROTEIN_ transpiration rates and xylem loading of cytokinins under ammonium supply . to suppress secondary effects while verifying a dependence of attip gene _PROTEIN_ on ammonium supply plants were transferred from mm nitrate to mm nitrate plus mm ammonium . under these conditions and clearly responded to ammonium supply by a dramatic increase in transcript levels within h . since this _PROTEIN_ pattern might indicate a role in ammonium loading into the _LOCATION_ we simultaneously determined changes in ammonium concentrations in the roots and found that they increased rapidly after plant transfer to ammonium peaked after h and then slightly declined . in particular transcript levels increased in parallel to ammonium concentrations in the root tissue until ammonium concentrations reached their maximal level . again this regulation differed to that of _PROTEIN_ and indicated that and probably also may participate in _LOCATION_ compartmentation and detoxification of ammonium . to verify an involvement of in _LOCATION_ loading in arabidopsis roots was overexpressed under the control of a camv promoter in arabidopsis plants . four homozygous lines were selected that showed dramatically increased _PROTEIN_ levels in the roots relative to the wild type . when grown under adequate supply of nutrients or under nitrogen deficiency in nutrient solution transgenic plants did not show any visible phenotype . moreover overexpressing lines were not more tolerant to methylammonium at ph when grown on agar . we therefore investigated whether the overexpression of might increase ammonium accumulation in roots under conditions of ammonium induction of nitrate fed plants . ammonium concentrations in roots of overexpressors however were not different from those of wild type plants either under nitrate nutrition after supply of mm ammonium for h or for longer and shorter periods . since ammonium accumulation in the root tissue was rapid ammonium transport across the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was unlikely to represent a limiting step for subsequent _LOCATION_ compartmentation irrespective of whether uptake was mediated by transporters with high affinity such as atamts or by transporters with low affinity which are not yet identified . thus under these conditions constitutive overexpression could not demonstrate an involvement of in methylammonium detoxification or in ammonium accumulation in roots .
