a gene encoding a predicted mitochondrially targeted single stranded dna binding protein _PROTEIN_ was identified in the arabidopsis thaliana genome sequence . this gene codes for a protein of amino acids including a residue putative mitochondrial targeting transit peptide . protein sequence alignment shows high similarity between the _PROTEIN_ protein and single stranded dna binding proteins from bacteria including residues conserved for ssb function . phylogenetic analysis indicates a close relationship between this protein and other mitochondrially targeted ssb proteins . the predicted targeting sequence was fused with the _METHOD_ coding region and the organellar localization of the _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was determined . specific targeting to mitochondria was observed in in vitro import experiments and by transient _PROTEIN_ of a _METHOD_ fusion construct in arabidopsis leaves after microprojectile bombardment . the mature _PROTEIN_ coding region was overexpressed in escherichia coli and the protein was purified for biochemical characterization . the purified protein binds single stranded but not double stranded dna . _PROTEIN_ stimulates the homologous strand exchange activity of e. coli reca . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is a functional homologue of the e. coli ssb and that it may play a role in mitochondrial dna recombination .
a putative ssb gene homologue that encodes a residue preprotein with a predicted residue mitochondrial transit peptide _PROTEIN_ was selected for detailed analysis . this protein shows high homology to ssb proteins from e. coli and a variety of other species . a second ssb homologue with a putative mitochondrial transit peptide was also identified in the arabidopsis genome sequence _PROTEIN_ . regions of significant homology between previously characterized ssb proteins and _PROTEIN_ include several identical amino acids that are known to be necessary for ssb function . the residues trp trp his phe in the e. coli ssb correspond to phe trp his his in _PROTEIN_ . these two proteins also have acidic c terminal ends . in the e. coli ssb protein amino acid residue his corresponding to his in _PROTEIN_ is known to be involved in ssb subunit interactions in helix stabilization and in determining the protein s affinity for dna . amino acid residue phe in the e. coli ssb corresponding to his in _PROTEIN_ is thought to be involved in dna binding . alteration of phe to a his residue was found not to alter the structure of the bacterial ssb as detected by nmr although it did reduce binding to dna . amino acid residues trp and trp corresponding to phe and trp in _PROTEIN_ are also thought to be involved in dna binding . analysis of mutants of the e. coli ssb protein has shown that trp is the more important residue of the two for ssdna binding and is responsible for the stabilization of protein dna complexes through stacking interactions with nucleotide bases . the importance of trp is emphasized by its conservation in both _PROTEIN_ proteins while the trp residue has been altered to a phenylalanine in _PROTEIN_ . in the e. coli protein the region between amino acid residues trp and phe _PROTEIN_ is predominantly hydrophobic and probably _METHOD_ a cleft between these two important amino acids that will fit one or two stacked pyrimidine _PROTEIN_ . five of the last amino acids in the e. coli ssb protein are negatively charged making the c terminus highly acidic . four of the last amino acids in _PROTEIN_ are negatively charged . this region has been implicated in interactions with proteins involved in dna metabolism but probably does not interact directly with reca . the acidic c terminal end may modulate dna binding but this acidic region is frequently missing in the mitochondrially targeted ssb proteins of many eukaryotic _METHOD_ . e. coli ssb proteins without the acidic terminal domain demonstrate an increase in affinity for dna and have enhanced helix destabilizing ability _METHOD_ . mitochondrially targeted ssb was predicted with high probability to be targeted to the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ by the psort and mitop prediction _METHOD_ . the mature _PROTEIN_ protein has an n terminal extension compared to bacterial ssb proteins . it also has a deletion near the c terminal end resulting in a total polypeptide length approximately equal to that of bacterial ssb proteins . it is unclear from the literature whether these differences at the ends of the protein would be expected to have any significant effect on ssb activity . it is possible that the extended n terminal region may interact with other proteins or have some other specific role in function of this protein . the _PROTEIN_ gene shows a similar arrangement with respect to the approximate size and location of introns and exons as the _PROTEIN_ gene except that _PROTEIN_ has two more exons than _PROTEIN_ . this suggests that the two genes may have arisen from the same parent gene and that the _PROTEIN_ gene subsequently gained two introns during evolution . the close relationship between the two _PROTEIN_ genes is supported by ml phylogenetic analysis of a broad taxonomic sample of ssb homologues which also supports the hypothesis that the plant _PROTEIN_ is closely related to other known _PROTEIN_ homologues . the amplified mitochondrial transit peptide region of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ encoding the predicted amino acid transit peptide sequence was cloned into a _METHOD_ fusion vector to produce a tp _METHOD_ . in vitro import studies with purified soybean mitochondria showed specific import of tp _METHOD_ into mitochondria . a control experiment with the same protein indicated that the fusion protein is not imported into isolated chloroplasts . the red _METHOD_ in fig . results from the chlorophyll in the chloroplasts and did not co localize with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . no _METHOD_ was detected in mitochondria incubated with _METHOD_ lacking a transit peptide demonstrating that a targeting sequence is necessary for the localization of _METHOD_ to mitochondria . to confirm mitochondrial localization of the _METHOD_ fusion the vector containing an _PROTEIN_ tp _METHOD_ fusion construct was introduced by microprojectile bombardment into expanded leaves of a. thaliana plants . green _METHOD_ was observed in mitochondria but not in chloroplasts or in the _LOCATION_ of cells bombarded with this construct . in control experiments with the vector lacking the _PROTEIN_ targeting sequence _METHOD_ was localized randomly in the _LOCATION_ . separate bombardments using a construct encoding a targeting sequence from mtreca previously demonstrated to be transported into mitochondria exclusively or a predicted chloroplast targeting sequence from a putative helicase confirmed specific localization of the products to mitochondria and chloroplasts respectively supporting the assumption that this system faithfully localizes proteins to their target organelles . the consistency between the results obtained from import into isolated organelles and transient _PROTEIN_ of a fusion protein in arabidopsis leaves strongly implies that the residue n terminal transit peptide sequence allows specific targeting of the protein to mitochondria . the recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein was _PROTEIN_ in e. coli and purified _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the purified protein was analyzed by _METHOD_ to determine the affinity of recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein for ssdna versus dsdna . recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein binds ssdna resulting in a similar shift of the dna to that induced by the e. coli ssb protein . in the presence of of the e. coli ssb nearly all of the ssdna was shifted . a slightly lower proportion of ssdna was shifted with of _PROTEIN_ and the shift did not increase significantly in the presence of _PROTEIN_ . a second shifted band is observed with _PROTEIN_ suggesting formation of an intermediate that is partially coated by the ssb . the results indicate that _PROTEIN_ has a slightly lower activity than the e. coli ssb but the overall pattern and location of the shifted bands are similar suggesting that the proteins have equivalent ssdna binding activity . the protein was found to have no binding activity for dsdna . the purified _PROTEIN_ protein was tested for its ability to stimulate the homologous strand exchange activity of e. coli reca analogous to the e. coli ssb . increasing amounts of _PROTEIN_ added to in vitro reactions with e. coli reca significantly stimulated strand exchange activity as indicated by enhanced resolution of the joint molecule band . at high levels of _PROTEIN_ a very clear band representing joint molecules is observed . a low level of strand invasion activity is present in the absence of any ssb as expected due to the basal level of activity common for reca proteins in the absence of ssb . however while there is some unresolved dna between the circular dna and the joint molecule band the resulting joint molecules do not form a distinct band indicating incomplete strand exchange . these results are similar to those reported by steffen and bryant for the ability of an ssb protein from streptococcus pneumoniae to stimulate the activity of e. coli reca . this is the first time that a mitochondrial ssb protein has been shown to have similar properties to the e. coli ssb and to have the ability to stimulate e. coli reca activity in vitro . collectively these results provide strong support for the identification of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ as a functional ssb protein targeted to mitochondria .
