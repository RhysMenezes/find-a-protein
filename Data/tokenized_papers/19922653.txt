tonoplast intrinsic proteins _PROTEIN_ are widely used as markers for _LOCATION_ compartments in higher plants . ten _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are encoded by the arabidopsis genome . for several _METHOD_ the tissue and cell specific pattern of _PROTEIN_ are not known . we generated _METHOD_ protein fusions to the genomic sequences of all members of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ family whose _PROTEIN_ is predicted to occur in root tissues _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ these fusions both individually and in selected pairwise combinations in transgenic arabidopsis . analysis by confocal microscopy revealed that _PROTEIN_ distribution varied between different cell layers within the root axis with extensive co _PROTEIN_ of some _PROTEIN_ and more restricted _PROTEIN_ patterns for other _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ whose _PROTEIN_ overlapped appeared to localise to the tonoplast of the central _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ bulbs and smaller uncharacterised structures . we have produced a comprehensive atlas of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis roots which reveals novel _PROTEIN_ patterns for not previously studied _PROTEIN_ .
in addition to the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ reporters we generated previously for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ we cloned the genomic sequences of not previously studied _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we produced chimeric constructs in which either _METHOD_ or monomeric _METHOD_ were fused in frame to the c terminus of each _PROTEIN_ genomic sequence and generated transgenic plants which were analysed for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ patterns by confocal laser scanning microscopy _PROTEIN_ . we first observed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ at low magnification . day old roots from seedlings _PROTEIN_ individual _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ were stained with propidium iodide and analysed by _PROTEIN_ . with the possible exception of _PROTEIN_ no _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ yielded a detectable signal in the root cap or meristem . in general _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ initiates at the elongation zone . while _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are detectable from the base of the elongation zone _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is first observed at the zone of transition with the differentiation zone . the onset of _METHOD_ occurs in different cell types depending on the _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is initially visible in endodermal cells before extending to every cell type in the differentiation zone . this pattern is faithfully replicated in _PROTEIN_ roots . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is strongest at the differentiation zone . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ becomes first detectable in the cortex and epidermis but its _PROTEIN_ extends to the pericycle as the root matures . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ has a similarly widespread distribution in more mature root axes but its _PROTEIN_ initiates in the pericycle then extends to cortex and epidermal cells . again the initial _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are mirrored in the _PROTEIN_ roots . in contrast to the previous _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is only _PROTEIN_ in epidermal and in cortical cells of the differentiation zone with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in more mature parts of the root where _PROTEIN_ roots emerge . _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in arabidopsis roots . day old roots from the indicated transgenic lines were excised stained with propidium iodide for min and visualised by _PROTEIN_ . the images show representative results for each construct . the signals from _METHOD_ and propidium iodide _METHOD_ are merged . top panels single optical sections of the root tips middle panels single optical sections of root differentiation zones . bottom panels maximal projection of optical z sections through mature root axes and young _PROTEIN_ roots . scale bars . in the case of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to be exclusively limited to the root cap and the columella . a very limited _METHOD_ signal can also be detected in the same region of the young _PROTEIN_ root and in older _PROTEIN_ roots . perhaps the most remarkable _PROTEIN_ pattern observed is that of _PROTEIN_ which in day old roots is only detectable in a small region at the base of the _PROTEIN_ roots . having identified the general patterns of _PROTEIN_ of the different _METHOD_ at low magnification we then studied the cell specificity of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in more detail . we analysed propidium iodide stained roots by _PROTEIN_ by performing optical z sections through differentiation zones at magnification . cell type specificity of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the root axis . day old roots from the indicated transgenic lines were excised stained with propidium iodide for min and visualised by _PROTEIN_ . stacks of optical z sections were collected from root axes at the differentiation zone . the images show representative results for each construct . a to f for each panel the top section shows a single xy optical section and the bottom section shows the xz projection of the whole image stack revealing the cross section of the root axis . the signals from _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and propidium iodide _METHOD_ are merged . g and h the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ trace from representative image stacks for the indicated transgenic lines was reconstructed segmented and rendered in with mimics . the different tissues are colour coded as follows brown epidermis red cortex blue endodermis green pericycle . ep epidermis c cortex e endodermis p pericycle x xylem . scale bar . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is clearly _PROTEIN_ in epidermis and cortex but its _PROTEIN_ is particularly strong in the endodermis and pericycle . here _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ highlights numerous bright circular structures in the lumen of the central _LOCATION_ . we hypothesise these are _LOCATION_ 'bulbs which have previously been described as tonoplast invaginations which occur independently of the ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ tagged _LOCATION_ proteins and where _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is concentrated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . it is however difficult in some cases to observe a continuity between these structures and the central _LOCATION_ tonoplast . at higher magnification the overlapping patterns of _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are confirmed . both are present in pericycle cells particularly in the rows of pericycle cells that form the xylem poles _PROTEIN_ . both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tend to be absent from the endodermis although we could detect discontinuous endodermal _PROTEIN_ at various positions along most root axes . in contrast to the previous _METHOD_ labelling inner root cell layers _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is clearly restricted to the root epidermis and cortex with no signal detectable in the inner layers . having analysed the _PROTEIN_ with the broadest _PROTEIN_ patterns we focussed on the two _PROTEIN_ which seem to have a more limited _PROTEIN_ range in roots . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ presented a patchy distribution in cells of the root cap . to ascertain that this was not an artefact due to _PROTEIN_ of our chimeric gene we also generated a construct _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ where _METHOD_ was fused downstream of the promoter and and in frame with the of the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence . in transgenic plants _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ presents a similar _PROTEIN_ pattern to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ thus ruling out _METHOD_ fusion artefacts . _PROTEIN_ is confined to the columella and the _PROTEIN_ root cap _PROTEIN_ with the labelled cells disappearing at the boundary with the elongation zone . some of the labelled cells are in the process of detaching from the root suggesting that they may correspond to 'border like cells _PROTEIN_ . the distribution of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is therefore radically different to that observed for its paralogue _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which has the widest pattern of _PROTEIN_ but is excluded from the root tip including the root cap . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in the root cap . day old roots from the indicated transgenic lines were excised stained with propidium iodide for min and visualised by _PROTEIN_ . stacks of optical z sections were collected from root tips . the images show a representative result for this construct . the signals from _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and propidium iodide _METHOD_ are merged . a maximal projection of the root tip at the base of the elongation zone . the image shows two adjacent z stacks of the same root separated by a black line . b and c xz projections of the image stack in panel a revealing two cross sections of the root axis taken in the regions of the root indicated by the arrowheads in a . d and e the regions indicated by dotted boxes in a were observed at high magnification . single optical sections are shown . note _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ of young root cap cells and in the tonoplast of root cap cells closer to the elongation zone . f the _METHOD_ traces from _METHOD_ and propidium iodide from the image stack in panels a were reconstructed segmented and rendered in with mimics . scale bars and . at the subcellular level _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localises to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of young root cap cells _LOCATION_ . the chimeric protein is mostly found on the tonoplast of elongated _PROTEIN_ root cap cells . this is likely to reflect different stages of _PROTEIN_ trafficking in cells of different ages rather than impaired capacity to reach the tonoplast . this is further demonstrated by the _PROTEIN_ that in the epidermis of cotyledonary cells where _PROTEIN_ is uniformly _PROTEIN_ the fusion protein appears to localise to the tonoplast . we have previously shown that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ becomes detectable in old root regions nearing the hypocotyl and is then widespread in hypocotyl and cotyledonary leaves _PROTEIN_ . we did not initially notice _PROTEIN_ in young roots but closer analysis revealed that in day old roots _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ has a very specialised _PROTEIN_ pattern . the _METHOD_ signal is detected in a _PROTEIN_ like cluster at the base of emerging _PROTEIN_ roots . in very early _PROTEIN_ root primordia _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is detectable in cells at the lrp . as the lrp grows further the number of cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ increases but remains confined to a cluster underlying the base the _PROTEIN_ root . in rare cases when the _PROTEIN_ root is fully emerged the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ can extend to some cells within the _PROTEIN_ root axis . co labelling with propidium iodide shows that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells are located in close proximity to the xylem suggesting a pericycle localisation . co _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which we found to be enriched in the pericycle _METHOD_ that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ originates from pericycle cells . this indicates that the initial _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is likely to occur in the lrp founder cells . remarkably the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ appears to be mutually exclusive with a clear boundary between cells _PROTEIN_ one or the other isoform . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ root primordia . a e day old roots from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic seedlings were excised stained with propidium iodide and visualised by _PROTEIN_ . stacks of optical z sections were collected from mature root axes . the images show representative results for this construct . maximal projections of the z stacks are shown with the individual signals for _METHOD_ propidium iodide or the merged signals . e the _METHOD_ traces from _METHOD_ and propidium iodide from the image stack in panels was reconstructed segmented and rendered in with mimics . note that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cells are in close proximity to the xylem . f i roots from day old transgenic seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were imaged . sequential stages of _PROTEIN_ root development are shown . inset in h note the boundary between pericycle cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . scale bars . we have shown that the various _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under study present diverse tissue specificity within roots . several _METHOD_ however are co _PROTEIN_ in certain tissues namely _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in order to ascertain whether these _METHOD_ were specific to distinct _LOCATION_ compartments we focused on the subcellular localisation of selected pairs of the above _METHOD_ tagged with different spectral variants of _METHOD_ proteins and co _PROTEIN_ in transgenic arabidopsis . overlapping _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are _PROTEIN_ detected at the tonoplast of the central _LOCATION_ . transgenic seedlings co _PROTEIN_ the indicated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs were grown for days on _METHOD_ medium agar plates . roots were excised and visualised by _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ merged images . arrowheads in panel i indicate structures labelled by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ but not _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . scale bars . the individual _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ patterns in double transgenic lines mirrored those observed in the lines _PROTEIN_ individual _METHOD_ . the widespread _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are co _PROTEIN_ in epidermis cortex and pericycle cells . in these tissues both proteins are detected on the tonoplast of the central _LOCATION_ . both the tonoplast and the smaller bulb like _LOCATION_ structures _PROTEIN_ are labelled . likewise _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mostly label the same tonoplast in the cell layers where they are co _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which almost overlap in root tissues are also co localised on tonoplast and 'bulbs . occasionally _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ highlighted smaller vesicular structures that did not appear to contain _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the nature of these structures was not investigated further . finally _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which is restricted to epidermis and cortex co localises with _PROTEIN_ in those tissues . note that the relative abundance of these two _METHOD_ mirrors the pattern observed in single isoform localisation with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ being strongest in the epidermis and weaker in the cortex and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ being stronger in cortex but weaker in epidermis . taken together these co _PROTEIN_ results indicate that each _PROTEIN_ isoform _METHOD_ protein fusion we analysed is predominantly found at the central _LOCATION_ tonoplast in arabidopsis root tissues .
the constructs encoding native _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and native _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ have been described previously _PROTEIN_ . a full list of primers designed to amplify the genomic sequences of the root _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is shown in additional file . each _PROTEIN_ genomic sequence including either the complete promoter region or kb of the promoter plus utr and introns was amplified from total genomic dna from arabidopsis thaliana columbia ecotype . primers included restriction sites kpni at the and xhoi at the of the target sequences . amplified fragments were cloned into the kpni and xhoi sites of upstream of a xhoi/saci fragment containing the _METHOD_ coding sequence and the ocs terminator fragment . a similar strategy was adopted to fuse _PROTEIN_ sequences to _METHOD_ but in this case the forward primers included both kpni and saci restriction sites generating a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ cassette that could be mobilized with saci . to obtain pairwise _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ combinations selected _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ cassettes were excised with saci and ligated into _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ vectors linearised with saci giving rise to constructs harbouring both reporter genes in a tandem . all the chimeric constructs were introduced into strain of agrobacterium tumefaciens harbouring the psoup vector . arabidopsis plants were then transformed using the floral dip method . about seeds from at least independent transgenic lines per construct were germinated onto agar plates containing half strength murashige and skoog _METHOD_ basal medium and grown for days at in a light dark regime . roots were excised mounted in half strength liquid _METHOD_ medium and immediately observed with a leica _PROTEIN_ confocal laser scanning microscope using either a air or a oil immersion objective . in some cases roots were preincubated for min in propidium iodide diluted in half strength _METHOD_ medium . _METHOD_ was excited at nm and detected in the to nm range . _METHOD_ was excited at nm and detected in the to nm range . propidium iodide was excited at nm and detected in the to nm range . simultaneous detection of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ and propidium iodide was performed by combining the settings indicated above in the sequential scanning facility of the microscope as instructed by the manufacturer . reconstruction of z stacks of optical sections was performed with the leica _PROTEIN_ af lite free software _METHOD_ . segmentation analysis and rendering were performed with mimics .
