glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase is an important enzyme in energy metabolism with diverse cellular regulatory roles in vertebrates but few reports have investigated the importance of plant gapdh _METHOD_ outside of their role in glycolysis . while animals possess one gapdh isoform plants possess multiple _METHOD_ . in this study cell biological and genetic approaches were used to investigate the role of gapdhs during plant immune responses . individual arabidopsis gapdh knockouts exhibited enhanced disease resistance phenotypes upon inoculation with the bacterial plant pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv . tomato . ko lines exhibited accelerated programmed cell death and increased electrolyte leakage in response to effector triggered immunity . furthermore ko lines displayed increased basal ros accumulation as visualized using the _METHOD_ probe . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ kos exhibited constitutive autophagy phenotypes in the absence of nutrient starvation . due to the high sequence conservation between vertebrate and plant _LOCATION_ gapdh our experiments focused on _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ cellular dynamics using a complemented _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line . confocal imaging coupled with an endocytic _LOCATION_ marker and endosomal trafficking inhibitors demonstrated _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ is localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the endomembrane system in addition to the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . after perception of bacterial flagellin _PROTEIN_ dynamically responded with a significant increase in size of _METHOD_ puncta and enhanced _LOCATION_ accumulation . taken together these results indicate that plant gapdhs can affect multiple aspects of plant immunity in diverse sub cellular compartments .
to determine whether individual arabidopsis gapdh _METHOD_ play a role during infection with pst we screened t dna insertion lines for knockout lines in distinct _METHOD_ . ko lines were obtained for the following gapdh _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the salk t dna ko lines for _PROTEIN_ have not been previously published and rt pcr validation is provided in ko lines in the _LOCATION_ glycolytic gapdhs _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were previously published as were the _LOCATION_ gapdhs . rt pcr validation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ kos is provided in homozygous t dna ko lines for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were not identified and there were no available t dna insertions in exons . a screen of two separate t dna insertion lines within the promoter of _PROTEIN_ yielded homozygosity for the insertion without altering gene _PROTEIN_ . the general morphology and plant size of individual ko lines during vegetative growth resembled col . after successfully identifying homozygous gapdh ko lines we subjected them to a variety of disease assays to determine their relative contribution during infection with pseudomonas syringae pv . tomato strain . ko lines and the col control were dip inoculated with pst and bacterial titers were determined four days post inoculation . all of the gapdh ko lines exhibited enhanced disease resistance with a fold reduction in bacterial titers compared to the col control when inoculated with virulent bacteria . lower bacterial titers correlated with a similar reduction in disease _METHOD_ . due to the high degree of sequence conservation between human gapdh with arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ we were particularly interested in the role of _PROTEIN_ in the innate immune response . the _PROTEIN_ ko line was complemented with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under control of its endogenous promoter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . two independent single insertion homozygous lines were identified _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and bacterial growth was analyzed . both npro _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines and complemented the _PROTEIN_ ko and exhibited similar bacterial growth and disease _METHOD_ as wild type col . we did not observe any morphological defects in the npro _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines . analysis of bacterial growth in individual _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ ko lines illustrating bacterial population sizes four days

gapdh kos were used to quantify basal _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ . statistical differences were calculated using fisher s lsd test following a significant f statistic . values represent means . data were analyzed using the method and normalized against arabidopsis elongation _PROTEIN_ . localized programmed cell death is a hallmark of eti and is termed the hypersensitive response . the hr can be visualized macroscopically when avirulent bacteria are syringe infiltrated into leaves at high concentrations . pst _PROTEIN_ the effector which is recognized by the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ immune receptor was used to investigate hr responses in individual gapdh ko lines . the progression of cell death was quantified by measuring electrolyte leakage using a conductivity meter . all ko lines exhibited an accelerated hr and enhanced electrolyte leakage compared to the wild type col control indicating a more rapid cell death progression in the ko lines . macroscopic hr was evaluated as well and ko lines displayed more rapid tissue collapse starting at post infiltration while col collapsed at post infiltration . an enhanced disease resistance phenotype was also found after inoculation with avirulent pst _PROTEIN_ . although all ko lines tested exhibit enhanced disease resistance to pst the magnitude of responses varied between individual lines . the _PROTEIN_ exhibited the highest resistance to virulent bacterial growth and displayed very few chlorotic _METHOD_ followed by _PROTEIN_ in overall symptom reduction and bacterial growth . electrolyte leakage measurements of individual _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ ko lines . four week old leaves were infiltrated with pst at a concentration of cfu ml . values represent means . macroscopic hr phenotype of col and gapdh knockouts post syringe infiltration with pst . empty vector control is shown as the top leaf . bacterial concentrations were the same as . we used quantitative pcr to determine if the cause of enhanced disease resistance in the gapdh kos was due to transcriptional priming for a defense response . pathogenesis related _PROTEIN_ is a commonly used defense marker gene whose _PROTEIN_ is induced in response to pathogen perception and salicylic acid . in unchallenged gapdh ko lines basal _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was constitutively up regulated compared to col . this indicates that gapdh ko lines may be primed for pathogen defense responses in the absence of an elicitor leading to accelerated defense responses upon pathogen inoculation . taken together these results indicate that multiple gapdh _METHOD_ act as negative regulators of plant immune responses . plant gapdh _METHOD_ arose through multiple gene duplication events . phylogenetic analyses of the seven arabidopsis gapdh _METHOD_ in addition to human and e. coli gapdh reveals a high degree of sequence conservation . gene duplication can lead to diversification of biochemical functions and _PROTEIN_ patterns . however duplicated genes may also carry out similar or overlapping functions making genetic analyses _PROTEIN_ . previously it was reported that a ko in the non phosphorylating gapdh induced higher level _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . in order to investigate if single gapdh kos induce differential regulation of additional _METHOD_ we performed quantitative real time pcr analyses to investigate basal _PROTEIN_ of gapdhs on four week old plants . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ at a very low level and were excluded from the analyses based on their high cq values . qpcr analyses of the individual ko lines revealed complex transcriptional regulation of some gapdh family members relative to wild type col . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were down regulated in all the gapdh kos while _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was unchanged in the majority of lines . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were down regulated in _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was up regulated in the _PROTEIN_ line presumably to help compensate for the loss of _PROTEIN_ however _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was not significantly different from col in the _PROTEIN_ line . overall _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ had the most significant alterations in _PROTEIN_ levels in the gapdh ko lines . thus gapdh family members appear to be under complex regulation with epistatic interactions occurring between _PROTEIN_ and the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . unrooted phylogeny of arabidopsis phosphorylating gapdhs as well as human and e. coli gapdh . arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cluster with human gapdh while photosynthetic gapdhs cluster separately . values at nodes indicate bootstrap values . scale bar indicates the number of amino acid substitutions per site visualized in the branch length . quantitative pcr analyses of leaves from four week old plants were used to quantify basal _PROTEIN_ levels of phosphorylating gapdhs across different ko lines . _PROTEIN_ values are shown relative to wild type col . data were analyzed using the method and normalized against arabidopsis elongation _PROTEIN_ . statistical differences were calculated using fisher s lsd test following a significant f statistic . values represent means . leaf protein extracts from four week old gapdh ko lines and col were assayed for gapdh activity in the glycolytic direction . gapdh activity in the single ko lines was assayed at for the reduction in nad . data from a minimum of independent runs were normalized to col and combined for statistical analyses . statistical differences were calculated using fisher s lsd test following a significant f statistic . values represent means . leaf protein extracts from four week old gapdh ko lines and col were assayed for gapdh activity in the calvin cycle direction . the gapdh activity in the photosynthetic reaction was measured as described in as the reduction in nadp over time . statistical analyses were performed as described in . to assess arabidopsis gapdh enzymatic activity in individual ko lines whole leaf homogenates were used to analyze rates of glycolysis and the calvin cycle . while _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have conserved sequence and glycolytic function with their animal and yeast counterparts plants have evolved chloroplastic gapdhs that function in the calvin cycle . the basic biochemical reaction performed by gapdh _METHOD_ in glycolysis and the calvin cycle is the same with the direction of the reaction being reversed . the direction being assayed can be controlled for in vitro by utilizing a two step enzymatic assay starting with reagents that preferentially drive substrate production in either direction . we used aldolase and fructose bisphosphate or phosphoglycerate to assess gapdh enzymatic activity in the direction of either glycolysis or the calvin cycle respectively . only _PROTEIN_ exhibited significantly impaired activity in both directions . this could be explained by the _PROTEIN_ transcript abundance of the _LOCATION_ gapdh _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in addition to chloroplastic _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ exhibited significantly reduced activity in the glycolytic direction . the _PROTEIN_ lines were not altered in activity as compared to col . it is possible that gapdh activity is reduced in _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ ko lines but this _PROTEIN_ is below the level of detection using a whole leaf assay . chloroplasts play a role in the initiation and propagation of the hr the generation of ros involved in transcriptional reprogramming of defense related genes and limiting cell death . therefore changes in _LOCATION_ gapdh activity may alter chloroplast contributions to immunity . gapdh enzymatically catalyzes the only reductive step in glycolysis and the calvin cycle and has been linked to programmed cell death in animal _METHOD_ . since changes in gapdh activity have been linked to cell death phenotypes in other _METHOD_ we examined changes in gapdh enzymatic activity during innate immune responses . plant immune responses were evaluated after activation of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a pattern triggered immune receptor which detects a amino acid epitope of bacterial flagellin termed . four week old arabidopsis plants were infiltrated with either or . glycolytic gapdh activity was evaluated in samples harvested at and post infiltration . enzymatic activity significantly increased in infiltrated samples taken at and compared with infiltrated samples . gapdh glycolytic activity assays were performed on four week old col after syringe infiltration with or at min min and min post infiltration . statistical differences were detected by a two tailed student s t test compared to water treated samples at each time point . col was infiltrated with cfu ml pst empty vector or . samples were harvested for the glycolytic activity assay post infiltration . statistical analyses were performed as described in . quantitative pcr analyses of four week old col leaves post infiltration with or water . and segregate separate qpcr runs . values represent means _PROTEIN_ . statistical differences were detected by a two tailed student s t test compared to treated controls . data were analyzed using the method and normalized against arabidopsis elongation _PROTEIN_ . to determine whether transcriptional regulation of gapdhs occurs during _PROTEIN_ we performed qpcr analyses using five of the seven phosphorylating gapdh genes in the arabidopsis col ecotype . four week old col plants were infiltrated with either or water and leaf tissue was harvested post infiltration . at post infiltration _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts were slightly down regulated to less than half the control while _PROTEIN_ transcript levels increased by more than two fold . these results demonstrate contrasting regulation of photosynthetic and glycolytic gapdhs during _PROTEIN_ . gapdh enzymatic activity increased in the glycolytic direction during _PROTEIN_ consistent with an increase in transcription of _PROTEIN_ . in order to evaluate alterations in glycolytic gapdh enzymatic activity during eti responses four week old col plants were infiltrated with or a bacterial suspension of pst carrying empty vector or . tissue was harvested at the first signs of the hr when vein silvering was initially visible . gapdh activity was significantly increased in leaves infiltrated with pst empty vector compared to as well as in leaves undergoing eti responses . we were unable to detect a gross change in total gapdh protein levels during bacterial infection or elicited immune responses using anti gapdh western blotting . however the sensitivity of western blotting is antibody dependent . therefore our antibody may not be sensitive enough to detect minor changes in protein abundance . all gapdh ko lines exhibited enhanced disease resistance to virulent and avirulent pst . one potent set of anti microbial molecules produced by plant cells during the innate immune response are reactive oxygen species . it is well documented that the role of _LOCATION_ ros production mediated by the nadph oxidase respiratory burst oxidase d _PROTEIN_ is critical to mounting an effective defense response to bacterial pathogens . a luminol based _LOCATION_ ros assay using as an elicitor was not able to cause a significant alteration in _LOCATION_ ros production for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant lines compared to col . interestingly when all ros data was analyzed together _PROTEIN_ had a significantly reduced burst compared to col . _PROTEIN_ is localized to the chloroplasts a site of significant intracellular ros production . it is possible that loss of _PROTEIN_ alters redox homeostasis dampening the ros burst produced by the nadph oxidase _PROTEIN_ . gapdhs can directly impact cellular redox potential through their involvement in the reducing step of either glycolysis or the calvin cycle . therefore the basal intracellular ros levels of gapdh ko lines were analyzed . protoplasts were isolated from four week old col _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants and incubated under bright light for since chloroplastic _METHOD_ are light activated enzymes . following incubation in the light the intracellular ros probe was added and protoplasts were kept in the dark for min prior to imaging . the extent of _METHOD_ was quantified from the pixel intensity for each genotype . although all gapdh ko lines exhibited significantly enhanced basal intracellular ros the magnitude of enhanced ros varied between lines . the accelerated cell death observed across gapdh ko lines during the hr may be explained by increased intracellular ros production in response to bright light stimulation as hr development depends on light and plants are placed under a light bank after inoculation . histochemical detection of ros in protoplasts isolated from the indicated genotypes upon incubation with the _METHOD_ probe _PROTEIN_ . protoplasts were left under bright light for and nm of _PROTEIN_ was added min prior to imaging . protoplasts were imaged using an _METHOD_ microscope fitted with a _METHOD_ filter . boxes indicate separate experiments and bar . quantification of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . pixel intensity corresponding to _METHOD_ of intact protoplasts was quantified across three experimental replicates and combined for statistical analyses . statistical differences were detected by a two tailed student s t test . previous reports indicated that recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are sensitive to hydrogen peroxide treatment supporting a hypothesis for gapdhs as cellular redox sensors . in order to investigate if all phosphorylating gapdh proteins are sensitive to hydrogen peroxide recombinant proteins were purified from e. coli and their enzymatic activity assessed before and after incubation with hydrogen peroxide . as previously shown _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ activity was _PROTEIN_ after incubation with hydrogen peroxide . furthermore _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ activity was also inhibited upon treatment with hydrogen peroxide . at lower concentrations ros have been described as acting as inter and intracellular signaling molecules which may condition cells for accelerated responses to stimuli . if gapdhs are acting as cellular redox buffers loss of one of these _METHOD_ may allow for greater ros accumulation . we chose to investigate _PROTEIN_ localization in detail due to its highly conserved amino acid sequence similarity to gapdhs in other _METHOD_ . in addition to _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ localizations animal _METHOD_ have linked gapdh to endosomal movement and _LOCATION_ fusion . signaling _METHOD_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and endomembrane are proving to be crucial in defense signaling of arabidopsis as well as animal _METHOD_ . arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ has been reported to be primarily _LOCATION_ with some _LOCATION_ re localization events in cells stressed by cadmium but no endomembrane localization has been described . our results indicating a change in glycolytic activity led us to hypothesize that _PROTEIN_ undergoes dynamic partitioning during the immune response potentially mediated by subcellular re localization . we investigated _PROTEIN_ localization by confocal microscopy using the npro _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line . plasmolysis using nacl revealed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized to hechtian strands indicating partial _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization . western blotting after _LOCATION_ fractionation in wild type col using gapdh shows endogenous gapdh is present in _LOCATION_ cytoplasmic and _LOCATION_ fractions . thus _PROTEIN_ exhibits diverse subcellular localizations in the absence of stress conditions . confocal micrographs of the _PROTEIN_ ko complemented with npro _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ show optical sections of three week old leaves . plasmolysis using m nacl demonstrates that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is localized to hechtian strands providing evidence of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization . arrow indicates hechtian strand and dotted line marks the cell boundary . leaves treated for h with bfa and co stained with highlight localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in bfa bodies . leaves treated with wortmannin have an increased size of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ puncta relative to water treatment . inset shows enlarged representative _METHOD_ puncta . bar . in order to further probe the relationship between _PROTEIN_ and cellular _LOCATION_ we treated the first true leaves of three week old plants grown in soil with either brefeldin a or wortmannin and examined them by confocal microscopy . bfa is known to inhibit arf gefs and block the _LOCATION_ dependent secretion pathway resulting in the characteristic formation of bfa bodies while wortmannin is an inhibitor of phosphatidyl inositol kinase and interferes with endocytosis and _LOCATION_ sorting . in the presence of bfa characteristic bfa bodies stained with co localized with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization is bfa sensitive . is an amphiphilic styryl dye that fluoresces in hydrophobic environments such as lipid _LOCATION_ and is commonly used as an endocytic marker . in animal _METHOD_ bfa induces the adp ribosylation of two proteins gapdh and . however subcellular localization of gapdh in response to bfa treatment has not been previously visualized in either plants or animals . in the wortmannin treated seedlings an increase in the size of endosomes occurred . these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization is sensitive to the inhibition of _LOCATION_ mediated and _PROTEIN_ endocytic trafficking pathways . furthermore these results highlight the diverse sub cellular localization of _PROTEIN_ . during the plant innate immune response several proteins dynamically re localize to different sub cellular compartments . _PROTEIN_ the well characterized flagellin receptor is an example of a protein that is dynamically re localized after immune activation . _PROTEIN_ is localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and is intimately connected with the endomembrane system . in the absence of flagellin perception resting state _PROTEIN_ is recycled through the trans _LOCATION_ network and early endosomal pathway . when activated _PROTEIN_ is endocytosed traffics through the endocytic pathway to _PROTEIN_ endosomes and reaches the multi vesicular body presumably for sorting and degradation . thus is an excellent probe for cellular re localization responses during _PROTEIN_ . we detected a change in total gapdh activity during innate immune responses and an association of _PROTEIN_ with diverse compartments in arabidopsis . therefore _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization was examined after elicitation with . leaves of four week old plants were infiltrated with or diluted in and imaged min post infiltration by confocal microscopy . leaves infiltrated with alone exhibited _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labeled _METHOD_ puncta that were on average half the size of those in leaves treated with . in order to statistically quantify the size change of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ puncta after treatment images from both treatments were pooled and blindly processed for average size . treatment was found to induce a significant increase in puncta area . arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and animal gapdh have also been described as dynamically re localizing to the _LOCATION_ in response to cellular stress . quantification of _METHOD_ labeled _LOCATION_ from confocal z stack slices revealed an increase in _LOCATION_ localized _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ after treatment . isolation of _LOCATION_ from seedlings treated with water or supports enhanced accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ after treatment . together these data indicate a dynamic re distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to the endomembrane system and _LOCATION_ during innate immune signaling . confocal micrographs of the _PROTEIN_ ko complemented with npro _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ show optical sections of leaves from four week old plants . leaves were infiltrated with a needleless syringe with and imaged after min . arrows indicate representative vesicles . leaves were infiltrated with of the elicitor and imaged after min . arrows indicate representative vesicles . images were quantified using imagej to calculate the area of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labeled vesicles per image across each treatment . statistical differences were detected by a two tailed student s t test . the size of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labeled vesicle increases significantly at min post infiltration with . _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ min post infiltration with or . arrows indicate individual _LOCATION_ . treatment with enhances _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ localization . _LOCATION_ were quantified from z stacks of n images per treatment . statistical differences were detected by a two tailed student s t test . _LOCATION_ isolation of npro _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ seedlings treated min with water or . accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ of treated seedlings was detected using _METHOD_ western blotting . _LOCATION_ enrichment was detected using histone and purity of _LOCATION_ was detected using the chloroplast specific photosystem ii _LOCATION_ protein by psbo western blotting . bar for all confocal images . autophagy is a highly conserved cellular recycling mechanism involved in degrading unnecessary or damaged materials and organelles during normal growth and development . although autophagy is an active process in growth and development few autophagy bodies are present in wild type plants under normal basal growth conditions . during specific cellular stresses such as exposure to ros _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ stress or nutrient starvation autophagy is induced and can lead to programmed cell death . given that gapdhs are involved in _PROTEIN_ metabolism and the individual ko lines exhibit enhanced disease resistance accelerated hr and enhanced intracellular ros accumulation we sought to examine alterations in autophagy responses . in arabidopsis autophagy can be induced by nitrogen starvation elicited by growing seedlings on nitrogen limiting media . for our experiments two week old seedlings were grown first on full strength _METHOD_ agarose media then transferred to liquid _METHOD_ or liquid _METHOD_ lacking nitrogen to induce autophagy for a period of days . monodansylcadaverine a _METHOD_ dye that specifically binds autophagosomes was used to visualize autophagy induction by confocal microscopy . concanamycin a an inhibitor of _LOCATION_ h _PROTEIN_ was used to de acidify the _LOCATION_ and allow for visualization of autophagosome accumulation in the _LOCATION_ . when grown on full _METHOD_ media col exhibits very few to no autophagy bodies . interestingly _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings grown on full nutrient media exhibited an enhanced accumulation of autophagosomes in the _LOCATION_ as compared to col . quantification of mdc labeled puncta within sections revealed a significantly higher number of mdc labeled autophagosomes in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings than col . however there was no gross difference observed between col and the gapdh ko lines in the number of autophagy bodies present under nitrogen starvation . these data suggest a role for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the negative regulation of basal autophagy as the induced autophagy response is phenotypically normal . confocal micrographs of col _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ ko lines show optical sections of leaves from two week old plants grown in full _METHOD_ seedlings were assayed with the _METHOD_ probe mdc . autophagosomes were stained using mdc for h. the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ ko lines had many mdc labeled bodies when grown in full _METHOD_ but wild type col did not exhibit a significant number of basal mdc labeled bodies . one concanamycin a or the equivalent amount of solvent _METHOD_ was added h prior to imaging . bar . confocal micrographs of day old col _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ ko lines transiently transfected with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to visualize _LOCATION_ autophagosomes . transiently transfected seedlings all exhibit _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labeled autophagosomes with greater numbers present in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ kos . bar . images depicted above were quantified using imagej to calculate the number of mdc or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labeled bodies in an area of . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings have significant increases in autophagosome number relative to col . statistical differences were calculated using fisher s lsd test following a significant f statistic to compare means of all genotypes . values represent means . the unfolded protein response triggered by _LOCATION_ stress is not constitutively activated in _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ kos . semi quantitative rt pcr analysis of _PROTEIN_ mrna demonstrates no cleavage product indicating that upr is not activated . the positive control on the left was induced in col leaves by infiltration with mm dtt . elongation _PROTEIN_ served as a control for equal mrna levels . to confirm the autophagy phenotype observed with mdc seedlings were transiently transfected with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and autophagosomes visualized by microscopy . autophagy is regulated by a set of autophagy related genes that are highly conserved across eukaryotes . when autophagy is initiated the ubiquitin like protein can be used as a marker to label _LOCATION_ autophagosomes . autophagosomes labeled with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were present in the cytoplasm of col _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings . similar to the mdc labeling quantification of the number of _METHOD_ labeled puncta in image sections revealed a significantly higher number of autophagosomes present in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings compared to col . autophagy is a diversely regulated process and is intricately connected to cellular _PROTEIN_ metabolism . not only does _PROTEIN_ availability directly impact glycolysis but it also impacts glycosylation modifications in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . under nutrient stress a disruption of protein glycosylation in the _LOCATION_ can lead to the unfolded protein response and trigger autophagy . to investigate upr triggered autophagy we examined the upr marker _PROTEIN_ . during the upr in plants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are activated and cause the cleavage of the mrna _PROTEIN_ which can be visualized by the presence of a doublet after rt pcr using primers spanning the cleavage site . col treated with dtt was used as a positive control for induction of the upr and confirmed the generation of a doublet pcr product using previously published primers that span the alternate splicing site . no cleavage of _PROTEIN_ mrna was observed in the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ ko lines with or without elicitation by . without cleavage of _PROTEIN_ mrna canonical upr activation should not be responsible for the induction of autophagy .

_METHOD_ agarose plates and grown for days in light/ dark at . seedlings were then transferred to liquid media containing _METHOD_ or nitrogen free _METHOD_ for more days under the same growth conditions . the night before imaging concanamycin a or equivalent volume of _METHOD_ was added to each well . three hours before imaging mdc was added and plates were wrapped in foil and kept in the dark . transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was as previously described with some modifications . after a four day co cultivation period with agrobacterium the co cultivation media was removed and seedlings were washed three times with distilled water . seedlings were then re suspended in full _METHOD_ media and imaged by confocal microscopy . all image analysis was performed using a combination of software tools zen software imagej and image pro plus . isolation of arabidopsis _LOCATION_ was carried out as previously described with some modifications . two week old seedlings were transferred to a six well culture plate and treated for min . one gram of seedlings from each treatment was frozen in liquid nitrogen for _LOCATION_ isolation . seedlings were ground in liquid nitrogen and re suspended in extraction buffer _PROTEIN_ mm mm spermidine mm spermine mm mercaptoethanol triton x . the suspension was stirred at for minutes and then filtered through two layers of cheesecloth stacked with two layers of miracloth . percoll suspensions of and percoll were prepared in gradient buffer _PROTEIN_ mm mercaptoethanol triton x . three ml of percoll were added to a ml conical tube and under laid with ml of percoll . the plant extract was pipetted on top and the sample was centrifuged at for minutes at . _LOCATION_ were extracted from the interface between the and percoll layers into a ml tube . the _LOCATION_ fraction was brought to ml volume with gradient buffer and under laid with percoll and centrifuged at for minutes at . after the supernatent was completely removed and the pellet was re suspended in ml gradient buffer ml of percoll was again under laid and the centrifugation repeated . the pellet was then re suspended in laemmli buffer quantified for equal loading using pierce protein assay and diluted to for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gel analysis .
