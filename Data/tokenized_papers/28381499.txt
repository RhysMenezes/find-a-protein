the complexity of plant antioxidative _METHOD_ gives rise to many unresolved questions . one relates to the functional importance of dehydroascorbate reductases in interactions between ascorbate and glutathione . to investigate this issue we produced a complete set of loss of function mutants for the three annotated arabidopsis dhars . the combined loss of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ extractable activity to very low levels but had little effect on phenotype or ascorbate and glutathione pools in standard conditions . an analysis of the subcellular localization of the dhars in arabidopsis lines stably transformed with _METHOD_ fusion proteins revealed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _LOCATION_ while _PROTEIN_ is chloroplastic with no evidence for peroxisomal or mitochondrial localizations . when the mutations were introduced into an oxidative stress genetic background _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ combination _PROTEIN_ glutathione oxidation and inhibited _PROTEIN_ triggered induction of the salicylic acid pathway . these effects were reversed in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complemented with any of the three dhars . the data suggest that dhar can be _PROTEIN_ to negligible levels without marked effects on ascorbate pools the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ are particularly important in coupling intracellular hydrogen peroxide metabolism to glutathione oxidation and dhar dependent glutathione oxidation influences redox driven salicylic acid accumulation .
to analyze the roles of the three dhar genes we obtained arabidopsis t dna mutants with insertions in the corresponding coding sequences . homozygous lines were readily obtained for dhar mutations and reverse transcription pcr confirmed that they were all knockouts or severe knockdowns . loss of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ function _PROTEIN_ extractable leaf activity by about while the effect of the _PROTEIN_ mutation was much less marked . from these lines three double mutants were produced . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant showed similar activity to _PROTEIN_ while the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ combination _PROTEIN_ dhar activity to of the wild type level . combining the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations led to an increase in dhar activity compared with the _PROTEIN_ single mutant pointing to a compensatory effect that was presumably linked to _PROTEIN_ because a triple mutant in which all three genes were mutated showed negligible activity . when grown in standard conditions none of the single double or triple mutants showed any difference in phenotype compared with col . similarly leaf ascorbate and glutathione pools remained at wild type levels and reduction states . as a first test of the role of each dhar in stress responses mutants were grown in vitro in agar containing stressful concentrations of cadmium mannitol salt or paraquat and root growth was measured . loss of dhar function caused a slight increase in cadmium sensitivity which was more evident at low concentrations and which was apparent even in the three single mutants . growth on mannitol was not substantially affected by the mutations but _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the triple mutant showed somewhat enhanced sensitivity to nacl . all three single mutations enhanced sensitivity to the oxidative stress caused by paraquat although combination of the mutations did not reinforce this effect . taken together the above results suggest that none of the three dhars is required for plant development but that they may interact in a complex manner to determine stress resistance . to explore this point further the three mutations were introduced into a catalase deficient background in which enhanced intracellular availability increases the demand on reductants such as ascorbate and glutathione . thus we produced double _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants and from these lines we produced three triple and one quadruple mutant . analysis of extractable leaf dhar in _PROTEIN_ revealed that the activity was increased in response to the oxidative stress caused by catalase deficiency . analysis of double _PROTEIN_ dhar mutants suggested that _PROTEIN_ was responsible for most of the dhar activity in the _PROTEIN_ background and that the remainder was largely due to _PROTEIN_ . activities in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were similar suggesting that as in the col background _PROTEIN_ makes a minor contribution to the extractable leaf activity . consistent with this no activity was detected in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or the quadruple _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant . as reported previously the _PROTEIN_ mutant showed only about of wild type leaf catalase activity and this was not affected by any of the combinations of dhar mutations . the activities of two other enzymes of the ascorbate glutathione pathway glutathione reductase _PROTEIN_ and ascorbate peroxidase were increased alongside dhar in _PROTEIN_ but the presence of the dhar mutations had little effect on either . the dhar mutations did not affect rosette _METHOD_ in the _PROTEIN_ background but two mutant combinations significantly impacted the _PROTEIN_ triggered phenotype . while _PROTEIN_ and most of the derived _PROTEIN_ dhar lines showed clearly visible hypersensitive response like lesions on specific leaves these were much less apparent in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . genetically or pharmacologically induced catalase deficiency causes the accumulation of glutathione . accordingly leaf glutathione was about fold higher in _PROTEIN_ than in col with the difference being almost entirely due to gssg . as a result the glutathione reduction state which was above in col was only in _PROTEIN_ . glutathione was significantly less oxidized in the triple _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and quadruple _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants and this was accompanied by _PROTEIN_ total glutathione in these two lines . all other _PROTEIN_ dhar lines showed similar glutathione status to _PROTEIN_ . as reported previously ascorbate is less affected in _PROTEIN_ than is glutathione . no difference in total ascorbate contents was observed in any of the mutants relative to col . however several lines in the _PROTEIN_ background showed a slightly but significantly more oxidized ascorbate pool as a result of the presence of additional mutations in dhar . fusion proteins were constructed for all three dhars with the _METHOD_ tag fused c or n terminally _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the six constructs were transformed into the quadruple _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the triple _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant backgrounds and plants were analyzed . despite repeated attempts we were not able to regenerate plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in either the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ background . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed a _LOCATION_ localization in the leaves of the quadruple mutant background . a similar localization also was observed for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the roots of this line and in the leaf cells of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutant background . _METHOD_ patterning did not overlap with the positive control for peroxisomal localization . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusions showed similar _METHOD_ patterns to the negative _METHOD_ control confirming a _LOCATION_ localization in the leaves of both genetic backgrounds . both _PROTEIN_ fusions also gave a _LOCATION_ signal in the roots . in contrast to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was associated with the chloroplast . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal showed close overlap with chlorophyll _METHOD_ in the leaves of both the complemented quadruple and triple mutants . to establish whether _PROTEIN_ also might be targeted to the mitochondria we compared _METHOD_ _METHOD_ with mitotracker signals and with a positive control for dual chloroplast _LOCATION_ targeting _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in roots . mitotracker _METHOD_ revealed no overlap with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal . whereas _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ patterns were observed in both the larger _LOCATION_ and the smaller punctate mitochondria _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals were observed only in _LOCATION_ . when the _METHOD_ was fused to the _PROTEIN_ n terminus _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ no association with the chloroplast was observed instead a diffuse pattern of staining appeared consistent with targeting of the native _PROTEIN_ to the chloroplast through an n terminal signal peptide sequence . in conclusion these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _LOCATION_ while _PROTEIN_ is localized in _LOCATION_ . this distribution was not affected by the presence of the _PROTEIN_ mutation . to further evaluate the importance of the three dhars in oxidative stress responses we analyzed the ability of dhar _METHOD_ fusion proteins for each of the three dhars to complement extractable activity glutathione contents and phenotypes in individuals of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant . for each dhar two independent lines were obtained that showed a segregation for antibiotic resistance in . in resistant _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants dhar activity was restored to about of the value in _PROTEIN_ . no increase in extractable dhar activity was detected in antibiotic resistant individuals from the quadruple mutant complemented with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . complementation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ caused significant increases in gssg . as a result the glutathione status of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants was more similar to that of the single _PROTEIN_ mutant than to that of the parent quadruple mutant line . no effect on ascorbate was observed . despite the lack of a detectable increase in extractable activity in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ complemented lines introduction of this protein also increased glutathione contents and _PROTEIN_ the glutathione reduction state . however the effect was somewhat different from that produced by the introduction of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . complementation with _PROTEIN_ caused glutathione to increase above _PROTEIN_ levels and to remain more reduced than in _PROTEIN_ albeit less reduced than in the uncomplemented quadruple mutant line . again no effect on ascorbate was observed . complementation with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ restored the _PROTEIN_ lesion phenotype in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ quadruple mutant . two experiments with different batches of seed revealed a phenotype segregation . in a first step to analyze this effect more closely lesions were quantified using imaging software . quantification in col and the eight _PROTEIN_ dhar loss of function lines showed that all lines carrying the _PROTEIN_ mutation presented lesions on about of the total rosette surface except the two lines in which _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ functions were both lost _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ dependent lesions could be fully restored by complementation of the quadruple mutant with any of the three dhars . the role of the different dhars in oxidative stress linked to catalase deficiency was further tested using _PROTEIN_ . like the _PROTEIN_ mutation catalase inhibition by this herbicide engages gsh dependent processes which become apparent as the accumulation of gssg . spraying with _PROTEIN_ caused a bleaching phenotype within d in the wild type . the appearance of this phenotype was inhibited in _PROTEIN_ and more clearly in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants as well as in the triple _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant line . similar to the effects observed in the _PROTEIN_ background _PROTEIN_ induced accumulation of gssg was _PROTEIN_ significantly in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and especially in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . consequently glutathione remained significantly more reduced in these lines than in the wild type treated with _PROTEIN_ . to explore the processes underlying the phenotypic effects described above we analyzed the effects of the three dhar mutations on transcripts of a key gene involved in salicylic acid synthesis _PROTEIN_ and two sa dependent pathogenesis related genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . all three genes were markedly induced in response to oxidative stress in _PROTEIN_ but less so in the quadruple _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ line . in the col background the triple loss of dhar function also _PROTEIN_ basal levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts although _PROTEIN_ transcripts were increased slightly . in a second approach we profiled the lesion phenotype of the leaves from col and all eight lines containing _PROTEIN_ and dhar mutations in combination . in the _PROTEIN_ single mutant cell death was apparent on the oldest leaves both as whitish lesions and trypan blue positive staining . similar phenotypes to _PROTEIN_ were observed in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . by contrast lesions were restricted to one or two of the very oldest leaves in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the quadruple mutant . hence a clear phenotypic difference was apparent between these two lines and the others carrying the _PROTEIN_ mutation particularly on leaves and . measurements of glutathione specifically in these leaves confirmed the effect of the combined _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations on _PROTEIN_ triggered effects on glutathione . analysis of sa in the same leaves revealed that while all other _PROTEIN_ carrying genotypes accumulated sa to around fresh weight in leaves and sa remained at close to wild type levels in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and in the quadruple mutant . to assess the significance of this effect the quadruple mutant was selected for an analysis of resistance to virulent bacteria . while bacterial growth was substantially lower in _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type the simultaneous presence of the three dhar mutations caused partial loss of this induced resistance . although no difference in bacterial growth was observed between col and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ sa accumulated somewhat less in response to infection in the triple mutant . similarly the combined loss of the three dhar functions _PROTEIN_ sa accumulation following infection of the quadruple mutant compared with _PROTEIN_ .
