plant cells contain several types of _LOCATION_ with specialized functions . although the biogenesis of these organelles is well understood at the morphological level the machinery involved in plant _LOCATION_ formation is largely unknown . we have recently identified an arabidopsis mutant _PROTEIN_ that is deficient in _LOCATION_ formation . _PROTEIN_ is homologous to a protein that regulates _LOCATION_ fusion at the tonoplast in yeast . on the basis of these observations _PROTEIN_ is predicted to play a direct role in _LOCATION_ biogenesis and vesicular trafficking to the _LOCATION_ in plants . in this work we show that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a complex with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in vivo . these two proteins are homologues of proteins that have a well characterized role in _LOCATION_ fusion at the tonoplast in yeast . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _LOCATION_ associated and cofractionate with tonoplast and denser endomembrane markers in subcellular fractionation experiments . consistent with this _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are found on the tonoplast and the prevacuolar compartment by immunoelectron microscopy . we also show that a _PROTEIN_ containing complex includes type syntaxins and is most likely involved in _LOCATION_ fusion on both the pvc and tonoplast in vivo . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are the first components of the _LOCATION_ biogenesis machinery to be identified in plants .
in yeast _METHOD_ the c vps complex including _PROTEIN_ a protein from the family . on the basis of the homology between and _PROTEIN_ an arabidopsis homologue is probably found in a similar complex with _PROTEIN_ . six genes are annotated as members of the family of proteins in the arabidopsis genome . on the basis of sequence analysis these arabidopsis genes can be classified into four groups . the arabidopsis genes belonging to each group are more closely related to a yeast homologue from this family _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ than to other arabidopsis paralogues . by this criterion a single gene homologue of _PROTEIN_ can be found in arabidopsis . because of sequence information and functional homology we renamed this . we have obtained the complete cdna corresponding to the _PROTEIN_ gene by rt pcr on root tissue . the cdna sequence was deposited in the genbank database . cdna differs substantially from the cdna predicted from the genomic sequence in the arabidopsis database and contains a amino acid open reading frame . we have also identified a single gene homologue of _PROTEIN_ in the arabidopsis genome . the full length cdna was acquired from an est clone . the gene is named _PROTEIN_ and contains a amino acid open reading frame . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ show higher sequence identity to the homologues from mus musculus and homo sapiens than to the yeast _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins respectively . to study _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in more detail we raised antibodies in rabbits against protein fragments _PROTEIN_ as his fusions in escherichia coli . the crude sera were affinity purified and used for all subsequent experiments . we investigated the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in different tissues by western blot analysis . the proteins were ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ in all tissues analyzed although a higher _PROTEIN_ was observed in roots a pattern similar to that of other arabidopsis genes involved in vesicular trafficking such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins contain no hydrophobic stretches that may function as signal peptides or transmembrane domains or sequences that resemble transit peptides for transport into _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ localization signals . therefore they are predicted to be _LOCATION_ proteins . many _LOCATION_ proteins involved in vesicle trafficking associate with _LOCATION_ to perform their function . we analyzed the presence of these proteins in soluble and _LOCATION_ fractions from arabidopsis cell cultures by differential centrifugation experiments . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were present entirely in the microsomal fractions similar to known microsomal proteins like _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were solubilized from the _LOCATION_ by urea nacl and under alkaline conditions but to varying extents . the extraction efficiency resembles the solubilization of the previously described peripheral _LOCATION_ protein _PROTEIN_ unlike the integral _LOCATION_ protein _PROTEIN_ which is solubilized only with detergent . thus _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are unlikely to be integral _LOCATION_ proteins . lacking detectable transmembrane domains they appear to be peripherally associated with _LOCATION_ probably by interacting with other _LOCATION_ anchored proteins . to discern the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we fractionated microsomes from arabidopsis in linear sucrose density gradients and their distribution in the gradient was compared with previously characterized markers of different compartments of the arabidopsis endomembrane system . the _LOCATION_ markers _PROTEIN_ and ataleu fractionate at the top of the gradient whereas markers from other compartments such as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are present in denser fractions . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were present at the top of the gradient together with ataleu and _PROTEIN_ . in addition they were also present in denser fractions together with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ associate with the tonoplast _LOCATION_ as well as with some denser compartments . to confirm the observed cofractionation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with _LOCATION_ markers we isolated _LOCATION_ from arabidopsis cell cultures as previously described . the fractions enriched in _LOCATION_ were selected under the microscope by staining with neutral red . we examined the presence of different markers of the endomembrane system in the _LOCATION_ fractions . as expected the _LOCATION_ markers ataleu and _PROTEIN_ were enriched in the _LOCATION_ fractions but neither _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ nor _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ were present at detectable levels in the _LOCATION_ enriched fractions indicating that they were not contaminated with those endomembranes . the _LOCATION_ enriched fractions contained a significant amount of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ indicating that these proteins were associated with the tonoplast _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ was previously localized to the pvc but it may also be found on the tonoplast in the apical meristem . however the enrichment _PROTEIN_ was not as high as in the case of _PROTEIN_ or ataleu . the previously described localization of _PROTEIN_ strongly suggests that _PROTEIN_ may be associated with two _LOCATION_ populations the pvc and probably the tonoplast . to further determine the localization of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we performed immunogold electron microscopy on arabidopsis roots . double immunolabeling with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ antisera showed that both colocalized extensively . the colocalization was found consistently over the tonoplast and a dense _LOCATION_ structure probably the pvc . however not all _LOCATION_ were equally labeled . the anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies proved to be unsuitable for immunoelectron microscopy . thus we decided to use transgenic arabidopsis plants that _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein . using the _METHOD_ monoclonal antibodies we were able to show that _PROTEIN_ labeling was associated with the tonoplast and the same dense compartments consistent with the localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . tonoplast localization of _PROTEIN_ in purified _LOCATION_ and in plants _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein allowed us to conclude that _PROTEIN_ localization was not altered in transgenic arabidopsis plants . to decide unambiguously whether the dense subcellular structure labeled with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins is the pvc we performed colocalization of _PROTEIN_ and tagged _PROTEIN_ in transgenic arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . it was previously shown that localization of tagged type syntaxins to the pvc is not affected in the transgenic arabidopsis plants . using monoclonal antibodies and affinity purified _PROTEIN_ antibodies we confirmed that the atc vps complex was localized to the pvc . interestingly although _PROTEIN_ was previously localized to the tonoplast in the apical meristem by immunoelectron microscopy no labeling of the tonoplast was detected by use of either _PROTEIN_ or antibodies in plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in yeast _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ form part of a multiprotein complex called the c vps complex . we investigated whether the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins assemble into a complex in arabidopsis . we used the _PROTEIN_ antibodies to immunoprecipitate _PROTEIN_ interacting proteins from detergent extracts of arabidopsis microsomes . we studied the presence of candidate proteins in the _PROTEIN_ immunoprecipitated fraction by immunoblotting . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were coimmunoprecipitated with the _PROTEIN_ antibody indicating that they interact in arabidopsis forming the atc vps complex . the c vps complex in yeast interacts with the _PROTEIN_ syntaxin facilitating its assembly into a trans snare complex and promotes _LOCATION_ fusion . the closest homologues of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis are type syntaxins . we analyzed whether the atc vps complex interacts with type syntaxins and/or other syntaxins from arabidopsis . no interaction of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ with atc vps proteins was observed when _PROTEIN_ antibodies or _PROTEIN_ antibodies were used for the immunoprecipitation . to avoid the possibility that our assay is not sensitive enough to detect the interactions we decided to analyze the complex formation in transgenic arabidopsis plants that overexpress epitope tagged _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the most likely candidate snares . the localization of both tagged type syntaxins is not altered in these transgenic plants as was shown previously . the use of highly sensitive antibodies further facilitated the detection of type syntaxins in eluates . using _PROTEIN_ antiserum we were able to precipitate both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from detergent extracts isolated from arabidopsis microsomes .
protein sequences of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and their closest homologues were acquired from genbank _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . full length sequences were aligned using the clustalw algorithm and a phylogenetic tree was prepared using the drawgram algorithm . the percentage of identity toward the arabidopsis protein indicated in parentheses was calculated using the align algorithm . all sequence analyses were performed in the biology workbench web based environment under default conditions . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were cloned into . these plasmids resulted in a translational fusion of a fragment of either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ with six histidine residues . overexpressed fusion proteins were purified under denaturing conditions by nickel affinity chromatography as described by the manufacturer and used to immunize rabbits at cocalico biologicals _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the antibodies were affinity purified as described by citation . briefly the purified recombinant proteins were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and transferred to nitrocellulose and the strip containing the fusion protein was cut out . after blocking in milk crude serum was incubated with the strip . after extensive washing the specific antibodies were eluted with mm glycine ph . the eluate was neutralized and used in all further experiments . differential centrifugation and extraction of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from microsomal _LOCATION_ were performed as described incitation . sucrose density gradients were done essentially as described previously by citation . protein samples were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies to _PROTEIN_ ataleu _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the pcr modified _PROTEIN_ cdna was inserted as axhoi bamhi fragment behind the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus promoter in pezt nl binary vector . the construct was transformed into agrobacterium tumefaciens and subsequently vacuum infiltrated into arabidopsis ecotype columbia as described previously . cryosections of arabidopsis root tips were prepared as described by citation and used for all immunogold labeling experiments as in citation . a monoclonal antibody to green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ was acquired from clontech laboratories . for double labeling experiments after incubation of the grids with the first antibody a second fixation step followed by a second blocking step was used to prevent cross reactivity of the antibodies at _PROTEIN_ stages of the protocol . many sections from independent plants were observed for each combination of antibodies . controls were performed with the use of the corresponding preimmune serum substituted for one or both of the antisera . in all cases these controls demonstrated high specificity of the labeling . detergent extracts of microsomes from arabidopsis tissues and subsequent immunoprecipitations were performed as described in citation and citation . briefly detergent extracts were incubated with specific antibodies or preimmune sera at followed by protein a sepharose beads . beads were pelleted and extensively washed and bound proteins were eluted in _PROTEIN_ sample buffer . each immunoprecipitation experiment was repeated at least twice from independent plants . a monoclonal antibody to tag was acquired from novagen .
