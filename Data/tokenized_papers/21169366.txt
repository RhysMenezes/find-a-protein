reactive _PROTEIN_ especially unsaturated _PROTEIN_ produced through lipid peroxidation damage biomolecules such as proteins and nucleotides elimination of these _PROTEIN_ is therefore essential for _PROTEIN_ cellular homeostasis . in this study we focused on an nadph dependent detoxification of reactive _PROTEIN_ in plants and explored the enzyme system involved in this detoxification process . using acrolein as a model unsaturated _PROTEIN_ we purified a predominant nadph dependent acrolein reducing enzyme from cucumber leaves and we identified the enzyme as an alkenal/one oxidoreductase _PROTEIN_ catalyzing reduction of an unsaturated bond . cloning of cdna encoding _PROTEIN_ revealed that cucumber contains two distinct _PROTEIN_ chloroplastic _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . homologs of cucumber _PROTEIN_ were found among various plant species including arabidopsis and we confirmed that a homolog of arabidopsis also had _PROTEIN_ activity . phylogenetic analysis showed that these _PROTEIN_ belong to a novel class of _PROTEIN_ . they preferentially reduced unsaturated ketones rather than unsaturated aldehydes . furthermore we selected candidates of other classes of enzymes involved in nadph dependent reduction of _PROTEIN_ based on the bioinformatic information and we found that an aldo keto reductase and aldehyde reductases were implicated in the reduction of an aldehyde group of saturated aldehydes and methylglyoxal as well as unsaturated aldehydes in chloroplasts . these results suggest that different classes of nadph dependent reductases cooperatively contribute to the detoxification of reactive _PROTEIN_ .
using concentrated crude extracts prepared from cucumber and arabidopsis leaves we measured reducing and oxidizing activity against representative unsaturated and saturated _PROTEIN_ found in plants using nadph nadh nadp or nad because known enzymes catalyzing reduction of the _PROTEIN_ need at least one of these biological reductants/oxidants . as a result _PROTEIN_ reducing activity using nadph as a reductant was predominant in crude extracts of both cucumber and arabidopsis the level of nadph dependent reduction was more than times greater than that of nadh dependent reduction . both unsaturated and saturated aldehydes were not oxidized in the presence of nad or nadp suggesting that aldehyde dehydrogenase which catalyzes the oxidation of aldehyde groups to _PROTEIN_ groups is apparently not involved in the major detoxification pathway of unsaturated aldehydes . neither reducing nor oxidizing activities against butanone were detected . results obtained by spectrophotometric analysis and _PROTEIN_ in peak areas of all substrates after enzymatic reaction observed by hplc analysis indicated the presence of aldehyde group reducing enzyme in crude extracts . in addition the presence of unsaturated bond saturating activity was also indicated because a part of the acrolein crotonaldehyde methylvinyl ketone ethylvinyl ketone and penten one was reduced to their corresponding saturated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . these results indicate that the detoxification of reactive aldehydes is mediated by reduction of both the aldehyde group and unsaturated bonds with nadph as a reductant . to identify the acrolein scavenging enzyme of plants we used cucumber leaves as a biological source because they exhibit high levels of acrolein reducing activity . this activity was completely eliminated by boiling suggesting that a proteinaceous acrolein reducing enzyme might be involved in the reduction of acrolein . purification of the acrolein reducing enzyme is summarized in table . the acrolein reducing enzyme was purified through successive chromatographies using anion exchange chromatography hydroxyapatite phenyl sepharose and gel filtration . estimation of native molecular _METHOD_ by superose column gel chromatography suggested that the molecular _METHOD_ of the acrolein reducing enzyme was about kda . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of the purified enzyme showed a single band at kda . these data suggested that the acrolein reducing enzyme was a monomeric protein of kda . acrolein has two potential sites to be reduced as follows an unsaturated bond and an aldehyde group . fig . shows two theoretical reduction pathways of acrolein catalyzed by enzymes using nadph as a reductant . one is an _PROTEIN_ catalyzed pathway and the other is an _PROTEIN_ or alcohol dehydrogenase catalyzed pathway . the former yields propionaldehyde as its product whereas the latter yields allyl alcohol . to distinguish which site was reduced the reduced product from acrolein was determined through hplc after _PROTEIN_ reactive dnph derivatization . after incubation the peak of acrolein dnph _PROTEIN_ accompanying the stoichiometric appearance of the other peak coinciding with propionaldehyde dnph at min as incubation time increased . furthermore we confirmed through _METHOD_ in the negative ionization mode that the m/z of the product was which corresponds to that of propionaldehyde dnph . from these results we concluded that the purified acrolein reducing enzyme hydrogenated the unsaturated bond of acrolein and resulted in propionaldehyde as the product . using various related compounds the substrate specificity of the purified enzyme was investigated . we found that the enzyme preferentially reduced alkenones such as buten one penten one penten one and hexen one . _PROTEIN_ without an unsaturated bond such as propionaldehyde butyraldehyde and butanone did not serve as substrates . the purified enzyme reduced acrolein and crotonaldehyde but not methyl butenal and methyl butenal suggesting that the presence of at least one hydrogen bound to both the and _PROTEIN_ is essential in a substrate . in addition the enzyme did not reduce cyclohexen one indicating that cyclic enone is not a substrate for the purified enzyme . long _PROTEIN_ chain unsaturated aldehydes such as pentenal and hexenal were not substrates for this enzyme . the kinetic parameters of the purified enzyme for unsaturated aldehydes and ketones are shown in table . its km value against acrolein was mm whereas that against crotonaldehyde was mm . its km value against unsaturated ketones was much lower than those against unsaturated aldehydes as a result the purified enzyme showed high specificity to unsaturated ketones . this substrate preference is a common characteristic among enzymes with unsaturated bond hydrogenation activity . the acrolein reducing enzyme operated times faster in the presence of nadph than in the presence of nadh . consequently the purified enzyme was identified as an nadph dependent _PROTEIN_ using short chain unsaturated _PROTEIN_ as its substrates . hereafter we use the term c. sativus _PROTEIN_ to denote the purified acrolein reducing enzyme . the internal amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme was determined through de novo sequencing using _METHOD_ after trypsin digestion . we designed degenerate primers from two obtained peptide sequences and determined full length cdnas encoding _PROTEIN_ protein using the _PROTEIN_ method . cloning of the cucumber _PROTEIN_ resulted in the determination of two distinct sequences encoding _PROTEIN_ . the isolated csaor cdnas were bp encoding a polypeptide composed of amino acids and bp encoding a polypeptide composed of amino acids . to confirm that these polypeptides encoded functional _PROTEIN_ we _PROTEIN_ recombinant _PROTEIN_ fused proteins in e. coli and found that both recombinant proteins had _PROTEIN_ activity . a homology search suggested that homologous genes were found in various plant species and that they could be divided into two groups one with variable n terminal sequences and the other without . chlorop analysis showed that these n terminal sequences contained a chloroplast targeting signal motif indicating that chloroplastic and/or _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ would be distributed widely in plant species . in these amino acid sequences a glycine rich sequence which contains the motif of the nadph binding rossmann like domain found in shikimate dehydrogenase is strictly conserved . because the csaor polypeptide composed of amino acids contained a putative transit peptide for _LOCATION_ sorting at the n terminus as predicted by chlorop we constructed the _METHOD_ fusion proteins and transiently _PROTEIN_ them in spiderwort to determine the intracellular localization of these two csaor polypeptides . in the case of the csaor polypeptide with amino acids strong green _METHOD_ was distributed in the _LOCATION_ in the case of the csaor polypeptide with amino acids _METHOD_ was observed at the periphery and at the center of the cell . _METHOD_ of chlorophyll and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was completely overlaid suggesting that the csaor with amino acids was the chloroplastic protein . on the other hand the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of the csaor with amino acids was distributed in the cytoplasm around _LOCATION_ along _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and in the nucleoplasm of the _LOCATION_ . because _METHOD_ inherently tends to localize in _LOCATION_ however the localization of csaor in the _LOCATION_ can not necessarily support a conclusion . thus we concluded that the csaor with amino acids and that with amino acids were the chloroplastic csaor and the _LOCATION_ csaor respectively . the purified native csaor enzyme was thought to be a cschlaor because its native molecular _METHOD_ coincided with the theoretical molecular _METHOD_ of cschlaor but not with that of cscytaor . homology search of csaor revealed that a homologous gene was included in arabidopsis genomic dna . to confirm that this gene also encoded _PROTEIN_ we cloned the cdna of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the recombinant protein in e. coli . in constructing the _PROTEIN_ plasmid we removed about residues of the n terminal sequence because these regions are highly divergent among known sequences probably because of the _LOCATION_ targeted transit peptide . we observed that the _PROTEIN_ fused _PROTEIN_ protein was successively _PROTEIN_ in the soluble and functional fractions . the kinetic parameters of _PROTEIN_ were fairly similar to those of csaors . _GENE_ protein has a predicted transit peptide in the n terminal region and has been identified as a stromal protein in chloroplasts by two independent proteomic analyses . accordingly we concluded that _PROTEIN_ was the chloroplast localizing _PROTEIN_ . the localization of _PROTEIN_ in chloroplasts suggests the importance of detoxification of unsaturated _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ the photosynthetic process . however as shown in fig . _PROTEIN_ could not reduce longer unsaturated aldehydes suggesting that other enzyme might be involved in the detoxification . the detoxification of unsaturated _PROTEIN_ can be achieved through the reduction or oxidation of their _PROTEIN_ groups . in crude extracts of cucumber and arabidopsis nadph dependent reducing activity predominantly occurred against both unsaturated and saturated aldehydes suggesting that sdr and/or _PROTEIN_ are involved in the reduction of these aldehyde groups . therefore to establish the detoxification pathway of unsaturated _PROTEIN_ in chloroplasts we selected candidates involved in the detoxification of unsaturated _PROTEIN_ i.e . the reduction of aldehyde group of both long unsaturated aldehydes and saturated aldehydes . selected candidate genes for sdr and _PROTEIN_ satisfied at least one of the following criteria co _PROTEIN_ with unsaturated bond reducing enzymes _PROTEIN_ or arabidopsis alkenal reductase as shown in the publicly available arabidopsis co _PROTEIN_ data base _PROTEIN_ predicted chloroplastic protein status according to psort or chlorop _METHOD_ . known genes having other enzymatic activity were excluded . the selected candidate genes were cloned into an _PROTEIN_ vector and encoded proteins were _PROTEIN_ in e. coli as _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins . enzymes recovered in soluble form were purified through affinity chromatography using a gsh sepharose column and the activity of recombinant proteins was measured . we successfully detected both unsaturated and saturated aldehyde reducing activity associated with two sdr family proteins and one _PROTEIN_ protein . a summary of the substrate specificities and kinetic parameters of the proteins _GENE_ and _GENE_ are shown in fig . and table respectively . they reduced saturated aldehydes such as propionaldehyde and butyraldehyde in the presence of nadph but not nadh as a reductant . this result does not contradict the results obtained using crude extracts which suggested nadph dependence . these proteins also did not reduce butanone and did not oxidize propanol butanol or ethanol in the presence of nadp or nad . they did reduce the aldehyde groups of unsaturated aldehydes such as pentenal hexenal and nonenal but not acrolein and crotonaldehyde . aldehyde group reduction of unsaturated aldehydes was confirmed by the _PROTEIN_ that saturated aldehydes were not detected as products after enzymatic reactions using unsaturated aldehydes as the substrates by hplc analysis . in addition these proteins reduced methylglyoxal a representative dicarbonyl compound produced during glycolysis and hexenal a major volatile involved in green leaf odor . the localizations of _GENE_ and _GENE_ were determined through a transient _PROTEIN_ assay using _METHOD_ fused with the n terminal regions of the polypeptides . distribution of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in both _GENE_ and _GENE_ completely corresponded to the _METHOD_ of chloroplasts suggesting that the n terminal regions of both proteins have chloroplast targeting transit peptides . based on these properties we concluded that these proteins were nadph dependent chloroplastic aldehyde reductases reducing saturated aldehyde and unsaturated aldehydes having more than _PROTEIN_ as substrates . _PROTEIN_ encoded by _GENE_ showed reducing activity of both saturated and unsaturated aldehydes . as in the case of atchladrs the activity of this _PROTEIN_ is completely dependent on nadph . analysis of subcellular localization indicated that this _PROTEIN_ is localized in chloroplasts accordingly it was named atchlakr . the substrate specificity of atchlakr overlapped with those of the atchladrs and atchlakr reduced acrolein and crotonaldehyde . ketones were not substrates for atchlakr . the kinetic parameters of atchlakr suggest that it reduces aldehydes with a higher efficiency than the atchladrs atchladrs had higher km and lower kcat values than atchlakr except for butyraldehyde and pentenal . two sdr family proteins are homologs of mammalian _PROTEIN_ . these are predicted to be chloroplastic proteins with low reliability . the distribution of _METHOD_ fused chimeric proteins suggested that the subcellular localization of these proteins was _LOCATION_ . recombinant protein studies showed that they exhibited nadph dependent reducing activity against saturated and unsaturated aldehydes in a pattern of enzymatic properties similar to that of the atchladrs . based on these results we concluded that these sdrs were nadph dependent _LOCATION_ adrs . _PROTEIN_ found in bacteria insects and animals reduce _PROTEIN_ groups of various secondary _PROTEIN_ and thus they are thought to be involved in the detoxification and inactivation of reactive _PROTEIN_ . also in arabidopsis atcytadrs probably act as detoxifying enzymes of reactive _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ .
