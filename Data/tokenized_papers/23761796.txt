complex i has a unique structure in plants and includes extra subunits . here we present a novel study to define its protein constituents . mitochondria were isolated from arabidopsis thaliana cell cultures leaves and roots . subunits of complex i were resolved by blue native /sds/sds _PROTEIN_ and identified by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . overall distinct proteins were found seven of which occur in pairs of _METHOD_ . we present evidence that arabidopsis complex i consists of distinct types of subunits of which represent homologs of bovine complex i . the nine other subunits represent special proteins absent in the animal linage of eukaryotes most prominently a group of subunits related to bacterial gamma type _PROTEIN_ anhydrases . a gelmap http //www.gelmap.de/arabidopsis complex i/ is presented for promoting future complex i research in arabidopsis thaliana .
to further investigate the subunit composition of arabidopsis complex i isolated mitochondria from leaves roots and cell cultures were analyzed by bn/sds/sds _PROTEIN_ according to meyer et al . . in the first gel dimension intact mitochondrial protein complexes are resolved by bn _PROTEIN_ . bands representing mitochondrial complex i are cut out from the gel and staples of up to three bands are transferred onto the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ system as published by rais et al . . the latter electrophoresis system combines the advantages of high resolution _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with differential resolution of hydrophilic versus hydrophobic proteins . the first _PROTEIN_ gel dimension contains polyacrylamide _PROTEIN_ plus m urea while the second _PROTEIN_ gel dimension contains no urea and has a _PROTEIN_ concentration of . on the resulting _PROTEIN_ gels proteins are dispersed around a diagonal line . this variation in electrophoretic mobility is presumably caused by an altered interaction between _PROTEIN_ and proteins in the presence or absence of urea . furthermore highly hydrophobic proteins show a differential electrophoretic mobility in gels with varying _PROTEIN_ concentrations . in low _PROTEIN_ gels hydrophobic proteins run slightly faster than hydrophilic ones and in high _PROTEIN_ gels the other way round . on the gel system suggested by rais et al . hydrophobic proteins run above the diagonal line . since complex i likewise includes highly hydrophobic and hydrophilic subunits this gel system nicely allows to investigate its composition _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . upon optimization of protocols bn/sds/sds _PROTEIN_ of complex i from arabidopsis cell culture leaves and roots allowed to visualize protein spots per fraction based on _METHOD_ staining . variation in subunit composition between the three arabidopsis tissues was not observed . investigation of complex i subunits from different tissues of arabidopsis thaliana by bn/sds/sds _PROTEIN_ . total mitochondrial protein from cell culture leaves and roots was resolved by bn _PROTEIN_ in a first dimension . complex i was cut out from the bn gel and used for second gel dimensions _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . lanes from the second dimension gels were again cut out and transferred horizontally onto third gel dimensions _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . gels were stained with _METHOD_ colloidal . complex i of cell cultures of leaves of roots . molecular _METHOD_ are given to the left and on the top of the gels . all protein spots of complex i from cell culture and selected subunits of complex i from leaves and roots were analyzed by esi _METHOD_ . overall distinct proteins were identified . analyses of two spots in the low molecular _METHOD_ range did not allow identifying any proteins . due to spot overlappings some proteins were detected in more than one spot . the _PROTEIN_ locations of all proteins as well as their secondary locations on the gel are given in table . overall out of the subunits of arabidopsis complex i occur in pairs of _METHOD_ . this reduces the number of distinct types of subunits detected in our complex i fraction to . the subunit was not detected by _METHOD_ in our or any previous investigation on arabidopsis complex i which is most likely due to its extreme hydrophobicity . systematic analysis of the subunit composition of complex i in the model organism yarrowia lipolytica also did not led to the identification of this subunit _PROTEIN_ . belongs to the core set of subunits present in all complex i particles . its gene is localized on the mitochondrial genome in arabidopsis transcribed and edited _PROTEIN_ . we speculate that is represented by spots or in the kda range of our gel both of which could not be identified . has a calculated _METHOD_ of kda but is very hydrophobic and therefore should run at kda upon _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we conclude that arabidopsis complex i consists of at least subunits of which were detected by our analyses seven of which occur in pairs of _METHOD_ . map of complex i from arabidopsis thaliana cell culture . total mitochondrial protein was resolved by bn/sds/sds _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ stained gel same gel as in indicating protein spots which have been analyzed by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . numbers correspond to those given in table . red arrows indicate the newly identified subunits _PROTEIN_ and . molecular _METHOD_ are given to the left and on the top of the gels . complex i subunits in arabidopsis thaliana . of complex i from arabidopsis were named according to their homologs in bovine complex i . exceptions arabidopsis homologs to the and kda subunits of bovine complex i are designated and because the corresponding proteins are encoded by the mitochondrial genome in plants . seven subunits occur in pairs of _METHOD_ in arabidopsis . the names of these proteins were extended by and arabidopsis complex i includes nine additional subunits absent in bovine complex i . these proteins are named in accordance to the literature _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and . numbers as given by tair http //www.arabidopsis.org . number in accordance with figure . in which the subunit was identified c cell culture l leaf r root . to three accession numbers are given for the _PROTEIN_ and proteins because they are encoded by a corresponding number of gene fragments on the mitochondrial genome in arabidopsis . transcripts encoding the complete proteins are generated by trans splicing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . for a limited number of subunits _METHOD_ analysis also was carried out for the arabidopsis leaves and roots fractions . identifications confirm the results obtained for the arabidopsis cell culture . however in some cases the _PROTEIN_ locations of corresponding subunits slightly vary between the fractions . it can not be excluded that these differences are caused by minor gel to gel variations which in some cases made it difficult to precisely assign spots between different fractions . possible variations in complex i subunit composition between different arabidopsis fractions should be further addressed by future studies . based on previous topological investigations for arabidopsis and other model _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ all subunits can be assigned to the _LOCATION_ or the peripheral arm of complex i . the peripheral arm consists of subunits the _LOCATION_ arm of subunits . five subunits of the _LOCATION_ arm form part of the so called _PROTEIN_ anhydrase domain which is absent in mitochondria of opisthokonts _PROTEIN_ . of the subunits represent homologs of subunits present in bovine complex i . two of these proteins _PROTEIN_ were identified for the first time in arabidopsis but previously predicted to form part of complex i by genome analyses . the high number of homologs in bovine and arabidopsis complex i underlines the remarkable conservation of this protein complex in eukaryotes . bovine complex i consists of subunits _PROTEIN_ only four of which were not found in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ . on the contrary arabidopsis complex i includes nine subunits absent in the bovine complex . of the nine extra subunits in plants five represent members of the ca/cal family . since deletion of single ca or _PROTEIN_ genes does not cause complete loss of intact complex i it can not be excluded that they present _METHOD_ which alternatively are present in complex i particles . however deletion of the gene leads to highly reduced levels of complex i indicating that _PROTEIN_ can not easily be replaced by _PROTEIN_ or . sequence identity between _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and is in the range of . in contrast sequences of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ subunits of arabidopsis are very similar possibly indicating that these proteins represent _METHOD_ . indeed deletion of the _PROTEIN_ or gene in arabidopsis does not visibly affect arabidopsis development but the double mutant is not viable . considering the size of the ca/cal domain upon single particle em of arabidopsis complex i it was concluded that it consists of at least three copies of ca/cal proteins . further experiments have to be carried out in order to clarify the number of ca/cal subunits per individual complex i particles . the plant specific _PROTEIN_ subunit binds to three complex i assembly intermediates of and kda but so far was not detected in preparations of intact complex i . our data point to the possibility that _PROTEIN_ also binds to the intact complex . however it can not be excluded that the kda complex i band excised from the bn gel also included small amounts of the band representing the kda subcomplex . three further plant specific subunits were detected on our gels and a protein encoded by . the and proteins were consistently detected in complex i fractions from plants . both form part of the _LOCATION_ arm . the protein was previously found to co migrate with complex i on a bn/sds gel _PROTEIN_ . however its status representing an integral complex i subunit in arabidopsis should be further investigated . in previous investigations based on bn _PROTEIN_ six additional complex i proteins were identified in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and . however detection of these proteins is not consistent . it currently can not be excluded that these proteins co migrate with complex i on blue native gels but form part of separate complexes . interestingly some of these proteins are known components of the pre protein translocase of the inner mitochondrial _LOCATION_ the _PROTEIN_ complex . it recently has been suggested that complex i and the _PROTEIN_ complex are physically linked in plant mitochondria . candidates of additional complex i subunits in arabidopsis thaliana . was suggested to be named in meyer . to facilitate identifying complex i subunits upon bn/sds/sds _PROTEIN_ a gelmap was generated for the _METHOD_ dataset of the gel presented in figure . gelmap is a software tool for the building and presentation of proteome reference maps . in contrast to alternative software packages it allows assignment of multiple proteins per protein spot and at the same time functional annotation of all proteins . by clicking onto protein spots widespread information is offered . several gelmaps on arabidopsis mitochondria are presented at the gelmap homepage including a map on _PROTEIN_ induced complex i . for the gelmap of arabidopsis complex i the identified proteins are grouped into functional categories according to their localization within the peripheral arm the _LOCATION_ arm or the _PROTEIN_ anhydrase domain attached to the _LOCATION_ arm . furthermore the six candidates for additional complex i subunits are given in another category . the proteins of the latter category are linked to an extra spot below the gel . by clicking onto any protein spot on the map all included proteins are displayed . proteins are sorted according to their mascot scores . upon clicking onto an individual protein a tooltip opens which includes additional information . extensive further information on each protein is offered by links to several external databases . the new gelmap is intended to be a helpful tool for future complex i research in arabidopsis . gelmap of complex i as resolved by bn/sds/sds _PROTEIN_ . upon hovering with the cursor over a spot a tooltip including information on all included proteins is opened . in the example given on the figure the indicated spot includes the _PROTEIN_ protein and two _METHOD_ of the tyky subunit . upon clicking into the spot the protein names are converted into stable links which can be used to obtain further information . protein information also can be obtained by clicking into the menu given to the right or by entering protein names or accessions into the search field below the menu .
