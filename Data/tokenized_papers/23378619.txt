the photoreceptor phytochrome b _PROTEIN_ interconverts between the biologically active pfr and inactive pr _METHOD_ in a red/far red dependent fashion and regulates as molecular switch many aspects of light dependent development in arabidopsis thaliana . _PROTEIN_ signaling is launched by the biologically active pfr conformer and mediated by specific protein protein interactions between _PROTEIN_ pfr and its downstream regulatory partners whereas conversion of pfr to pr terminates signaling . here we provide evidence that _PROTEIN_ is phosphorylated in planta at ser located in the n terminal domain of the photoreceptor . analysis of _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ phospho mimic and nonphosphorylatable _PROTEIN_ yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusions demonstrated that phosphorylation of ser negatively regulates all physiological responses tested . the and substitutions do not affect stability photoconversion and spectral properties of the photoreceptor but light independent relaxation of the _PROTEIN_ pfr into pr also termed dark reversion is strongly enhanced both in vivo and in vitro . faster dark reversion attenuates red light induced _LOCATION_ import and interaction of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ pfr with the negative regulator phytochrome interacting _PROTEIN_ compared with _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein . these data suggest that accelerated inactivation of the photoreceptor _PROTEIN_ via phosphorylation of ser represents a new paradigm for modulating phytochrome controlled signaling .
to determine whether _PROTEIN_ is phosphorylated in planta and if so on which amino acids we purified the _PROTEIN_ tap fusion protein from week old plants and subjected the samples to maldi tof _METHOD_ analysis . the detailed description of growth conditions sample preparation and maldi tof _METHOD_ analysis is provided in supplemental methods online . repeated rounds of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis indicated phosphorylation of various amino acid residues localized _PROTEIN_ in the n terminal domain of the photoreceptor . supplemental figure online illustrates the domain structure of _PROTEIN_ and supplemental figure online shows the quantitative time of flight collision induced dissociation spectrum of the ion observed at _METHOD_ to charge ratio that revealed phosphorylation of the peptide sfdysqslk . to provide an independent line of evidence for in planta phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ we analyzed phosphorylation of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein with or without phosphatase treatment by zn phos tag _PROTEIN_ a method suitable to separate phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated derivatives of the same protein . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was phosphorylated in both dark and r light grown seedlings although the amount of phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ appeared to be slightly lower in the latter sample . as maldi tof _METHOD_ experiments spanned a relatively long period of time we present data obtained by characterizing the biological function of the phosphorylation of ser residue that was first unambiguously identified by _METHOD_ analysis . to test the effect of ser phosphorylation on _PROTEIN_ controlled responses we replaced ser with either asp _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or ala _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ these as well the wild type _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins under the control of the promoter in _PROTEIN_ mutants . transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ these fusion proteins at nearly identical levels were identified and used for further studies . this figure also shows that _PROTEIN_ level of the various _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins was times higher compared with that of the native _PROTEIN_ in columbia . we determined to what extent the and substitutions affect light induced _PROTEIN_ controlled physiological responses . analysis of fluence rate dependent growth inhibition of hypocotyls in constant r light demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ seedlings displayed a strong hypersensitivity whereas _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ seedlings exhibited a pronounced hyposensitivity especially at lower fluence rates compared with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or col . seedlings _PROTEIN_ the mutant photoreceptor that was not phosphorylated at ser were by two orders of magnitude more sensitive to cr than those _PROTEIN_ the phospho mimic _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein . at a fluence rate of the growth inhibition response displayed by the mutants and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ seedlings was saturated and uniformly hypersensitive when compared with nontransgenic col seedlings . r light regulated cotyledon expansion at a low fluence rate again indicated that signaling by the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ photoreceptor was significantly attenuated . the response displayed was not only hyposensitive when compared with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and especially _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines but it was even slightly below the level of nontransgenic col . at higher fluence rates all transgenic lines exhibited similar hypersensitive cotyledon expansion responses compared with col . plants also respond to changes in the r/fr ratio of incipient white light . this response termed as shade avoidance is regulated by the concerted action of phytochromes and _PROTEIN_ is a major regulator of growth under shade . for these experiments seedlings were grown d in constant high r/fr conditions before being transferred for four more days to low r/fr conditions . as expected wild type seedlings responded to this shade mimicking treatment with hypocotyl elongation whereas the _PROTEIN_ mutant did not show any response . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ either as _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ completely inhibited hypocotyl elongation in response to low r/fr indicating that despite the low r/fr conditions there was enough _PROTEIN_ pfr to inhibit hypocotyl elongation . however hypocotyl elongation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was partially restored in low r/fr suggesting that the mutation inhibits _PROTEIN_ signaling . taken together these data above convincingly demonstrate that r light induced growth responses displayed by the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines are markedly different and that the phospho mimic substitution inhibits whereas the nonphosphorylatable substitution enhances _PROTEIN_ activity . the molecular machinery mediating light quality and quantity dependent _LOCATION_ import of _PROTEIN_ is only partially known . however it has been shown that _PROTEIN_ does not possess an intrinsic _LOCATION_ localization signal and its import into the _LOCATION_ can be mediated by interaction of _PROTEIN_ pfr with _LOCATION_ localization signal bearing proteins including the _PROTEIN_ . to determine if substitution of ser affects nucleo/cytoplasmic partitioning we monitored the velocity of light induced _LOCATION_ accumulation of the various chimeric photoreceptors . densitometric quantitative analysis of _METHOD_ demonstrated that the rate of light induced _LOCATION_ import of the various fusion proteins differed at low fluences of r. _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was imported into the _LOCATION_ upon irradiation with and of r light whereas the amount of _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ remained at the dark level . by contrast saturating r light uniformly elevated the level of _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ suggesting no significant difference between the _LOCATION_ accumulations of the various fusion proteins . these observations suggest that _LOCATION_ import of the phospho mimic _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is severely reduced under conditions when the amount of pfr is limited . _LOCATION_ localized _PROTEIN_ is associated with subnuclear protein complexes termed speckles _LOCATION_ bodies or photobodies and formation of these structures occurs in a fluence rate dependent fashion . here we show that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ photobodies are already formed after h of irradiation with r light whereas detection of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ photobodies requires irradiation with an order of magnitude higher fluence rate of r light . more strikingly our data indicate the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ photobodies were not detectable at fluences up to . under saturating light conditions all three _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins were associated with photobodies although the number and brightness of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ photobodies appeared to be somewhat reduced . _PROTEIN_ photobodies dissociate in extended darkness and this process is significantly accelerated by preirradiation with fr light thus indicating that these subnuclear structures contain _PROTEIN_ pfr . here we show that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ photobodies display an increased sensitivity to fr light . after receiving a short pulse of fr light _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ photobodies dissociated much faster in subsequent darkness when compared with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . it has been shown that degradation of _PROTEIN_ is induced by r light and that this process requires interaction of _PROTEIN_ pfr with _PROTEIN_ proteins . a significantly altered degradation rate of the _PROTEIN_ pfr at lower fluence rates could explain the observed hyposensitivity of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ controlled responses . therefore we determined the stability of the various _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins in seedlings exposed to weak cr light . data shown in figure clearly indicate that phosphorylation of ser did not significantly alter r light promoted degradation of the various fusion proteins at the fluence rate of . _PROTEIN_ interacts in a conformation specific reversible fashion with a battery of downstream signaling components including the well characterized _PROTEIN_ . to test how substitutions of ser to ala or asp affect the interaction of _PROTEIN_ pfr with _PROTEIN_ we performed yeast two hybrid assays under different light conditions . under nonsaturating light the galactosidase enzyme activity increased in a linear fashion in relation to irradiation time indicating that neither the amount of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pfr nor that of _PROTEIN_ was rate limiting . when compared with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the capacity of _PROTEIN_ pfr to bind _PROTEIN_ was greatly reduced . by contrast under saturating light conditions the binding capacities of the various _PROTEIN_ n terminal fragments to _PROTEIN_ were nearly identical indicating that substitution of ser with ala or asp itself does not physically interfere with or prevent interaction of these proteins . it has been shown that signaling by _PROTEIN_ pfr is stopped either by fr light driven conversion of the pfr into pr or by the light independent relaxation of the thermodynamically less stable pfr into the pr conformer . it is evident that dark reversion can play an important role under conditions when the amount of the pfr form is limited . the physiological and molecular analysis of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mutants demonstrated that phosphorylation of ser negatively regulates _PROTEIN_ signaling at low fluence rates . to test whether and/or substitutions affect spectral properties and/or fr induced photoconversion of the photoreceptor we compared the absorption spectra and rate of photoconversion of the various _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins in vitro . our data unambiguously demonstrate that photoconversion and difference spectra of these photoreceptor molecules do not significantly differ . to verify the possible involvement of ser phosphorylation in regulating dark reversion of _PROTEIN_ we measured the rate of this process in vitro in yeast cells and in planta . for in vivo assays we introgressed the various _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenes into the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double null background to minimize possible misinterpretation of the measured pfr/pr values due to high _PROTEIN_ levels in etiolated seedlings . dark reversion measurements showed that the phospho mimic mutant _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ reverts faster and to a greater extent than _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in vitro and in planta whereas substitution of ser to ala exerted the opposite effect . in comparison with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the percentage of dark reverting _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was reduced and the kinetics of the reaction were also slightly slower . we conclude that these results readily explain the _PROTEIN_ rate of _LOCATION_ import the limited formation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ photobodies in vivo and the reduced amount of _PROTEIN_ complexes in vitro and at least partially define the molecular mechanism by which phosphorylation modulated dark reversion negatively regulates _PROTEIN_ signaling .
