the dual affinity of ribulose bisphosphate _PROTEIN_ for and _PROTEIN_ results in the net loss of fixed _PROTEIN_ and energy in a process termed photorespiration . the photorespiratory cycle is complex and occurs in three organelles chloroplasts _LOCATION_ and mitochondria which necessitates multiple steps to transport metabolic intermediates . genetic analysis has identified a number of mutants exhibiting photorespiratory chlorosis at ambient _PROTEIN_ including several with defects in mitochondrial serine hydroxymethyltransferase activity . one class of mutants deficient in _PROTEIN_ activity affects _PROTEIN_ which encodes the mitochondrial shmt required for photorespiration . in this work we describe a second class of _PROTEIN_ deficient mutants defective in a distinct gene _PROTEIN_ which encodes ferredoxin dependent glutamate synthase . fd gogat is a chloroplastic enzyme responsible for the reassimilation of photorespiratory ammonia as well as for primary nitrogen assimilation . we show that fd gogat is dual targeted to the mitochondria and the chloroplasts . in the mitochondria fd gogat interacts physically with _PROTEIN_ and this interaction is necessary for photorespiratory shmt activity . the requirement of protein protein interactions and complex formation for photorespiratory shmt activity demonstrates more complicated regulation of this crucial high flux pathway than anticipated .
homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutants exhibit a severe photorespiratory phenotype of lethal chlorosis under low _PROTEIN_ and the requirement for supplementary _PROTEIN_ is absolute _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . by contrast a second stm allele herein called _PROTEIN_ that confers a similar reduction in shmt activity will grow without added _PROTEIN_ in dim light although the plants are chlorotic and considerably smaller than the wild type . although we initially attributed this less severe phenotype to a partial loss of _PROTEIN_ function we failed to identify any nucleotide lesion in the coding sequence and promoter region of _PROTEIN_ in the mutant . unexpectedly the progeny from crosses of this second allele with _PROTEIN_ were not chlorotic in low _PROTEIN_ and showed wild type levels of shmt activity . this genetic complementation suggests that this mutation although previously thought to be allelic with _PROTEIN_ is a mutation in a distinct gene . phenotypic analysis of photorespiratory mutants . we established that this second mutation maps to a position near the top of chromosome v between the markers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which is distinct from the positions of any of the seven shm genes . further analysis using chlorotic plants positioned the mutation close to _PROTEIN_ which encodes photorespiratory fd gogat . we therefore tested the hypothesis that our mutation was a novel allele of _PROTEIN_ by genetic complementation . indeed introduction into the mutant background of the wild type _PROTEIN_ gene driven by either the promoter or the endogenous _PROTEIN_ promoter both rescued the photorespiratory phenotype of chlorosis at low _PROTEIN_ and restored wild type levels of shmt activity . accordingly we conclude that this shmt defective photorespiratory phenotype is conferred by a novel allele of _PROTEIN_ designated _PROTEIN_ . earlier authors called _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ glts or gls but we propose to revise the mutant designation to be consistent with the accepted gene name . consistent with the identification of _PROTEIN_ as the gene responsible for the photorespiratory phenotype and loss of shmt activity in _PROTEIN_ there is a single nucleotide change between the wild type and mutant that changes amino acid from leu to phe . protein gel blot analysis indicates that fd gogat accumulates to approximately normal levels in _PROTEIN_ seedlings consistent with a point mutation that does not disrupt protein accumulation . _PROTEIN_ protein levels are unaffected in the _PROTEIN_ mutant although _PROTEIN_ protein is below detectable levels in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . as indicated above introduction of the wild type _PROTEIN_ gene driven by either its endogenous promoter or the promoter into _PROTEIN_ rescues the photorespiratory chlorosis phenotype and restores wild type levels of shmt activity . however introduction of a modified _PROTEIN_ carrying the mutation driven by the promoter into _PROTEIN_ fails to rescue chlorosis or to restore wild type levels of shmt activity in plants growing at ambient _PROTEIN_ levels consistent with this mutation conferring the photorespiratory phenotype . loss of function mutations in _PROTEIN_ had been previously demonstrated to exhibit photorespiratory chlorosis and loss of fd gogat activity . we confirmed that a t dna insertion mutant _PROTEIN_ in which the t dna has inserted into the exon of _PROTEIN_ lacks fd gogat protein and exhibits reduced fd gogat activity and photorespiratory chlorosis . this allele also confers a reduction in shmt activity . the _PROTEIN_ mutant is fully rescued by _PROTEIN_ of wild type _PROTEIN_ but not by _PROTEIN_ under control of the promoter . the plants resulting from a cross between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ display photorespiratory chlorosis and reduced shmt activity indicating that the two mutations are allelic . _PROTEIN_ has reduced shmt activity but retains wild type levels of fd gogat activity suggesting that the positive effect of _PROTEIN_ on shmt activity is independent of fd gogat catalytic activity . to test this we generated a new allele of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in which residues to including the central domain and parts of the n terminal aminotransferase domain and the fmn binding domain are deleted in frame . the _PROTEIN_ allele fails to rescue either photorespiratory chlorosis or fd gogat activity when introduced into _PROTEIN_ consistent with its predicted lack of fd gogat catalytic activity . however the _PROTEIN_ allele fully rescues photorespiratory chlorosis and shmt activity when introduced into the _PROTEIN_ mutant . thus we conclude that wild type levels of photorespiratory shmt activity require fd gogat _PROTEIN_ and that a mutation of results in a _PROTEIN_ species that is unable to sustain wild type shmt activity even though it retains wild type fd gogat activity . it is surprising and puzzling that the wild type _PROTEIN_ gene which encodes a chloroplastic fd gogat rescues a mutant lacking mitochondrial shmt activity . because fd gogat catalytic activity is not required for this rescue we speculated that perhaps a physical interaction between shmt and fd gogat might be necessary for full shmt activity . such a physical interaction would require common localization of fd gogat and _PROTEIN_ which seemed unlikely as photorespiratory shmt activity is known to be mitochondrial whereas photorespiratory fd gogat activity is chloroplastic . at this time the subcellular proteomics database does not provide proteomic data to support a mitochondrial localization of fd gogat . therefore to verify these localizations we performed microscopy analyses and biochemical fractionation experiments . first we made c terminal _METHOD_ fusions to _PROTEIN_ and to fd gogat in constructs driven by the endogenous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ promoters respectively . these transgenes were introduced into _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings to yield stably transformed lines . each _METHOD_ fusion construct rescued the photorespiratory defect of the corresponding loss of function mutant . protoplasts were generated from leaves of these rescued lines and analyzed by _METHOD_ microscopy . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed green punctate _METHOD_ that colocalized with _METHOD_ from the mitotracker red mitochondrial marker confirming that _PROTEIN_ is targeted to the mitochondria . as expected fd gogat _METHOD_ showed chloroplastic localization _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . unexpectedly fd gogat _METHOD_ also showed green punctate _METHOD_ that colocalized with the mitotracker red mitochondrial marker . this result indicates that fd gogat is targeted to both the chloroplasts and the mitochondria . second we performed biochemical fractionation experiments to confirm our microscopy observations . fd gogat was detected by protein gel blot analysis of wild type col seedlings in both chloroplastic and mitochondrial fractions . by contrast _PROTEIN_ was detected in mitochondrial but not in chloroplastic fractions . as expected the photosystem ii chlorophyll binding protein _PROTEIN_ was detected in chloroplastic but not in mitochondrial fractions . these data are consistent with our microscopy localizations of _METHOD_ fusion proteins . therefore we conclude that fd gogat is dual targeted to both chloroplasts and mitochondria . an increasing number of examples have been described in which proteins are dual targeted to both the chloroplast and _LOCATION_ . dual targeting is typically accomplished by the presence of tandem chloroplastic and mitochondrial targeting sequences or else by the presence of an ambiguous presequence that is recognized by the import apparatus of both organelles . we hypothesized that fd gogat may be dual targeted to mitochondria and chloroplasts by use of multiple translation starts . inspection of the sequence of fd gogat revealed two met residues representing potential translation initiation sites at positions and . computer predictions suggested that initiation at the first _PROTEIN_ codon would allow chloroplastic targeting whereas initiation at the second _PROTEIN_ would confer mitochondrial targeting . accordingly we generated three constructs based on the _PROTEIN_ cdna fused in frame to _METHOD_ and driven by the _PROTEIN_ promoter . the first encodes simply the wild type fd gogat sequence and is predicted to be targeted to the chloroplast . the second construct fd would be translated from the second met and is predicted to be targeted to the _LOCATION_ . the third fd is predicted to be targeted to the chloroplast . all three clones were transformed into the _PROTEIN_ mutant . we first tested for subcellular localization in protoplasts derived from stable transformants carrying the three constructs . as predicted fd gogat and fd show punctate _METHOD_ that colocalizes with the mitochondrial marker whereas fd shows chloroplastic and not mitochondrial localization . the transgenic _PROTEIN_ plants carrying pmas _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are rescued to a wild type phenotype under photorespiratory _PROTEIN_ conditions and _PROTEIN_ wild type levels of shmt activity . similarly _PROTEIN_ lacking the c terminal _METHOD_ and driven from the agrobacterium tumefaciens mannopine synthase promoter rescued _PROTEIN_ plants to a wild type phenotype under photorespiratory _PROTEIN_ conditions . however those _PROTEIN_ plants transformed with pmas _PROTEIN_ remain chlorotic at ambient _PROTEIN_ and have low shmt activity . this is consistent with a requirement for fd gogat to be targeted to the mitochondria to play its role in _PROTEIN_ of wild type levels of shmt activity . the photorespiratory chlorosis of _PROTEIN_ plants was not rescued by pmas _PROTEIN_ but was rescued by pmas _PROTEIN_ . dual targeting has also been shown to result from upstream translation from non _PROTEIN_ start codons to generate a mitochondrial isoform while translation from the _PROTEIN_ yields a chloroplastic isoform . interestingly _PROTEIN_ has an in frame _PROTEIN_ alternate initiation codon at position . we tested the importance of upstream translation to fd gogat dual targeting with two further constructs . in one pmas _PROTEIN_ we mutagenized both _PROTEIN_ start codons . this construct would be expected to rescue either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ seedlings if translation from the upstream _PROTEIN_ codon could yield a mitochondrial or a chloroplastic fd gogat isoform respectively . however pmas _PROTEIN_ does not rescue either mutant . in the second construct we introduced a stop codon at position in between the upstream _PROTEIN_ start and the _PROTEIN_ start codons at positions and . if translation from the upstream _PROTEIN_ were required for dual targeting then this construct pmas _PROTEIN_ would not be expected to rescue both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . however pmas _PROTEIN_ rescues both mutants . therefore we conclude both that upstream translation initiation is not necessary for dual targeting of fd gogat to both chloroplasts and mitochondria and that upstream translation initiation is not sufficient to yield enough fd gogat to support either its mitochondrial or its chloroplastic photorespiratory functions . one hypothesis to explain the requirement of mitochondrial fd gogat for photorespiratory shmt activity is that fd gogat _METHOD_ physical complexes with shmt . to test this hypothesis we performed coimmunoprecipitation on mitochondria purified from leaf extracts by percoll density centrifugation using an antibody against shmt to immunoprecipitate _PROTEIN_ and any interacting proteins . we probed those immunoprecipitates with an antibody against fd gogat . to test for the presence of fd gogat and shmt input extracts were probed with antibodies against fd gogat and shmt as well as with an antibody against the subunit of the inner mitochondrial _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ as a loading control . as can be seen in figure fd gogat was coimmunoprecipitated with _PROTEIN_ from wild type col extracts indicating that these two proteins form a complex in wild type leaves . in the absence of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant fd gogat was not coimmunoprecipitated indicating that the coimmunoprecipitation is dependent upon _PROTEIN_ protein and not due to cross reaction with another protein . the specificity of our assay for _PROTEIN_ encoded fd gogat is established by the failure to coimmunoprecipitate fd gogat protein from the _PROTEIN_ mutant which lacks photorespiratory fd gogat . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ driven by the promoter in the _PROTEIN_ background restores fd gogat protein capable of coimmunoprecipitation with _PROTEIN_ consistent with its full rescue of the photorespiratory phenotype . the mutation in _PROTEIN_ eliminates coimmunoprecipitation of fd gogat with _PROTEIN_ consistent with the photorespiratory phenotype despite the presence of wild type levels of fd gogat . this result implicates this residue in a role critical for interaction with _PROTEIN_ and suggests that the photorespiratory phenotype associated with the _PROTEIN_ mutation results from a loss of interaction of fd gogat with _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ deletion of kb of coding sequence which eliminates regions required for known catalytic function does not prevent interaction of fd gogat with _PROTEIN_ as indicated by the immunoprecipitation of a truncated fd gogat species . this is consistent with the ability of _PROTEIN_ to rescue the photorespiratory phenotype of _PROTEIN_ and implicates the c terminal region of fd gogat which includes in that interaction . to independently test the in vivo interaction of fd gogat with shmt we performed bifc . we fused _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to the n and c termini respectively of _METHOD_ and transfected the constructs singly or together into col protoplasts . _METHOD_ was placed at the c termini of the constructs to allow the fd gogat and _PROTEIN_ targeting signals to confer normal subcellular localization . neither construct alone yielded _METHOD_ but when the two constructs were cotransfected we observed punctate _METHOD_ that colocalized with the mitochondria . thus we conclude that fd gogat interacts with _PROTEIN_ in vivo .
