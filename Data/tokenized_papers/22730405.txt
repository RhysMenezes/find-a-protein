the plant hormone abscisic acid regulates stomatal movement under drought stress and this regulation requires hydrogen peroxide . we isolated guard cell hydrogen peroxide _PROTEIN_ which encodes a receptor like kinase localized on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in arabidopsis thaliana . _PROTEIN_ mutants were defective aba and induction of stomatal closure . genetic analysis indicates that _PROTEIN_ is a critical early component in aba signaling . the _PROTEIN_ mutation impaired aba and regulated activation of s type anion currents in guard cells . furthermore _PROTEIN_ physically interacted with phosphorylated and activated the s type anion channel slow _PROTEIN_ channel when coexpressed in xenopus laevis oocytes and this activation was inhibited by aba _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ . our study identifies a critical component in aba and signaling that is involved in stomatal movement and resolves a long standing mystery about the differential functions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in this process .
during a genetic screen for mutants that cause the changes of root growth to low ph in medium we randomly isolated an arabidopsis mutant that lost more water and wilted earlier than the wild type when growing in a pot with soil . we named this mutant _PROTEIN_ after we determined that its stomata are resistant to changes in and that this resistance is not related to ph change . the detached leaves of _PROTEIN_ lost water faster than those of the wild type in spite of having a similar number of stomata . the leaf temperatures of seedlings grown in soil were lower than in the wild type which correlates with the higher rate of water transpiration in _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type . because aba is an important stress hormone for regulating stomatal movement we used isolated epidermal peels to test the stomatal responses to aba the _PROTEIN_ mutation impaired aba induced stomatal closure and aba mediated inhibition of light induced stomatal opening . is the second messenger in the aba signaling pathway . _PROTEIN_ caused the preopened stomata to fail to close in response to or reduced the inhibition of light induced stomatal opening by . as a control the _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed similar stomatal closing as the wild type in response to . unlike _PROTEIN_ which reduces generation the _PROTEIN_ mutation did not affect production in guard cells . these results suggest that unlike _PROTEIN_ which acts upstream of _PROTEIN_ acts downstream of . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ responds to produced specifically in response to aba we further tested the stomatal responses to other phytohormones or pathogen elicitors . jasmonates and flagellin induce stomatal closing in a manner that is dependent on the generated by _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ nadph oxidases while salicylic acid induces stomatal closing likely through produced by cell wall peroxidases rather than nadph oxidases . under these producing conditions we always observed that preopened stomata closed to a lesser degree in _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type indicating that _PROTEIN_ is defective in responding to produced under different treatments . because the aba induced increase depends on synthesis we hypothesized that the blocking of early signaling by _PROTEIN_ would impair the activated channel . we used steady state whole cell patch clamp techniques to analyze the activities of channels . the channels were activated by both aba and in the wild type but not in _PROTEIN_ suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ mutation impairs the aba and activated channels . supplying exogenous consistently induced a similar stomatal closure in _PROTEIN_ as in the wild type . the saturation concentration of for stomatal closure was mm which is consistent with a previous report . these results indicate that the _PROTEIN_ mutation blocks the signaling that activates the channels . when well watered _PROTEIN_ did not show any unusual phenotypes in seedling growth . furthermore _PROTEIN_ did not exhibit any apparent difference in seed dormancy or in aba inhibition of seed germination postgermination growth or root growth relative to the wild type . rna gel blot analysis using total rna from d old seedlings indicated that the _PROTEIN_ mutation did not change the _PROTEIN_ of the aba inducible marker genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ relative to the wild type . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ primarily mediates aba dependent signaling in stomatal movement . to determine the genetic position of _PROTEIN_ in the aba signaling pathway we performed genetic analyses of _PROTEIN_ with some known aba mutants . we first compared the water loss of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . when water was withheld from plants growing in soil the _PROTEIN_ mutant lost water faster than the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant lost more water than either the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutant in soil . we also measured the water loss of plants growing in soil by estimating water transpiration during drought treatment . figure provides an example of the water loss pattern of seedlings during a h period . in the lighted period water loss was similar for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and both of these mutants lost more water than the wild type plants . in the dark period the _PROTEIN_ mutant lost more water than the _PROTEIN_ mutant but water loss was similar for the _PROTEIN_ mutant and the wild type plants . in response to darkness _PROTEIN_ slightly reduced the ability of preopened stomata in epidermal peels to close . these results are consistent with the previous report that darkness induced stomatal closure depends on with the previous report that the _PROTEIN_ mutation does not affect light regulated stomatal movement and with the current finding that stomatal closure in response to darkness is partially impaired in _PROTEIN_ . these results can also explain why the _PROTEIN_ mutant lost more water than the _PROTEIN_ mutant when growing in soil . under both light and dark conditions the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant exhibited greater water loss than the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutants . in detached leaves taken from week old plants growing in soil in a growth room the _PROTEIN_ mutant lost more water than the _PROTEIN_ mutant early in the assay and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant also lost more water than the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutants . we examined the stomatal apertures when leaves were treated with different concentrations of aba . as shown in figure aba treatment closed the stomata of the wild type but had little effect on the stomatal closing of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants . stomatal apertures however were larger for the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant than for either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ single mutant _PROTEIN_ of aba treatment suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is in parallel with _PROTEIN_ and/or acts downstream of _PROTEIN_ . because _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ demonstrate redundant roles in early aba signaling we compared the water loss phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ combined with _PROTEIN_ homolog mutants . we crossed the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant with the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant selected the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutant and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ quadruple mutant and then measured water loss of the selected mutants . as shown in supplemental figures and online the detached leaves of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ quadruple mutant lost water faster than those of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutant during a short period during this same period the leaves of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ their turgor . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ acts in parallel with _PROTEIN_ homologs in the aba signaling pathway and has an additive effect on regulating stomatal movement . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ that act as negative regulators in the aba signaling pathway . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are two dominant negative mutants both of which lost water faster than _PROTEIN_ in a detached leaf test _PROTEIN_ . water loss from detached leaves was similar for the double mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the single mutant _PROTEIN_ and was also similar for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are in the landsberg _LOCATION_ accession . to exclude the effect of different accessions on water loss we screened an ethyl methanesulfonate mutant pool and obtained a new _PROTEIN_ dominant negative mutation named _PROTEIN_ that is as resistant as _PROTEIN_ to aba in seed germination . the _PROTEIN_ mutation occurs in the amino acid just after the _PROTEIN_ mutation _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . mutation of gly to ser might interfere with the turn in the peptide in _PROTEIN_ gly which would prevent the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with aba receptors . _PROTEIN_ lost water faster than _PROTEIN_ or the wild type and lost water at a similar rate as the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ recessive loss of function mutants did not show clear differences in water loss compared with the wild type plants because the functions of these genes are redundant . however _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ recessive double mutants or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ recessive triple mutants showed a constitutive aba responsive phenotype and lost less water than the wild type plants . the detached leaves of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutant and of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ quadruple mutant lost a similar amount of water as the _PROTEIN_ single mutant . together these genetic results indicate that _PROTEIN_ acts at or downstream of these _PROTEIN_ proteins in the same aba signaling pathway . because _PROTEIN_ is a key s type anion channel that is regulated by the aba signaling pathway in stomatal movement we analyzed the genetic relationship between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ of water loss . _PROTEIN_ lost water faster than _PROTEIN_ but at a similar rate as the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant indicating that _PROTEIN_ is in the same pathway as _PROTEIN_ and acts upstream of _PROTEIN_ . we also compared the water loss of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant with that of _PROTEIN_ and found that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lost a little more water than _PROTEIN_ suggesting that either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ or both also regulate other channels . to clone _PROTEIN_ we crossed _PROTEIN_ with landsberg _LOCATION_ and planted the segregated seedlings in soil . the detached leaves from week old seedlings were allowed to lose water into the air and the putative mutants that lost water faster than the wild type were selected and retested for the water loss phenotype in the next generation . mutants that were confirmed to lose water faster than the wild type were used for map based cloning . although it was initially isolated from a t dna insertion mutant population the mutation in _PROTEIN_ does not involve the t dna . the _PROTEIN_ locus was mapped to chromosome between bac clones and . we found a bp deletion starting from position bp _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ . after the deletion a bp fragment that does not belong to the arabidopsis genome is present suggesting that a putative t dna fragment must jump away together with the deleted fragment and leave a bp fragment . the deletion was confirmed by pcr . a genomic dna fragment containing the whole gene of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but no other gene was transformed into the _PROTEIN_ mutant . eleven independent transgenic lines were obtained and tested for water loss and all had a water loss phenotype similar to that of the wild type . two of the independent lines were tested for water loss phenotype using plants growing in soil and detached leaves and were also tested for aba and mediated regulation of stomatal aperture both lines showed wild type phenotypes . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ complemented the _PROTEIN_ mutant . thus _PROTEIN_ corresponds to _PROTEIN_ . to determine the gene _PROTEIN_ pattern we constructed a _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ reporter vector and transformed it into wild type arabidopsis plants . gus staining indicated that _PROTEIN_ is highly _PROTEIN_ in guard cells and in the vascular _METHOD_ of roots and leaves . the _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ are similar to those of _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ suggests that besides the functions in guard cells _PROTEIN_ plays some unknown roles in other cell types . comparison of the pcr amplified _PROTEIN_ cdna with its genomic sequence indicates that _PROTEIN_ has three exons is predicted to encode a peptide that has amino acids and is a member of the lrr _PROTEIN_ . a typical lrr _PROTEIN_ contains an lrr _LOCATION_ domain for ligand binding at the n terminal site a cytoplasmic ser/thr protein kinase domain at the c terminus and one transmembrane domain in the middle . the putative _PROTEIN_ protein contains only three cys residues in the _LOCATION_ n terminus cys and cys which represent a cys pair that is well conserved in _PROTEIN_ and cys . considering the importance of cys in the formation of disulfide linkages within proteins or between two proteins we mutated each cys to ala and transformed them into the _PROTEIN_ mutant under the control of a super promoter . neither _PROTEIN_ nor _PROTEIN_ could complement the water loss phenotype of _PROTEIN_ but _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ could suggesting the importance of the cys pair but not cys in _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ has lrrs and is predicted to be localized on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to determine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ was fused to the _PROTEIN_ c terminus and transiently _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts or stably _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis under the control of a super promoter . confocal microscopy revealed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ localized to the cell surface in both transiently and stably _PROTEIN_ cells whereas _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was detected in the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ . after the mature zone of roots that stably _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was plasmolyzed with m mannitol the _METHOD_ labeling was _PROTEIN_ observed in the _LOCATION_ of the shrunken protoplasts . the transformation of _PROTEIN_ with constructs containing the super promoter _PROTEIN_ myc flag or _METHOD_ complemented the water loss phenotype of _PROTEIN_ . arabidopsis contains lrr _PROTEIN_ that are divided into subfamilies . _PROTEIN_ belongs to the lrr iii subfamily which has members some of which play important roles in various biological processes . _PROTEIN_ in the lrr xv subfamily may be involved in early aba signaling and embryonic pattern formation in arabidopsis . the functions of the two closest homologs of _PROTEIN_ in this subfamily _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are currently being studied . we did not find the t dna insertion line for _PROTEIN_ in the stock center . the _PROTEIN_ homologs are conserved in monocots and dicots . we amplified the _PROTEIN_ putative ortholog cdna from rice and _PROTEIN_ it under the control of a super promoter in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . water loss analysis indicated that rice _PROTEIN_ was able to rescue the water loss phenotype of _PROTEIN_ both for plants in soil and for detached leaves indicating that rice _PROTEIN_ can functionally substitute for arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ in regulating stomatal movement . however a clear drought phenotype was not seen in these overexpression lines . aba promotes stomatal closure _PROTEIN_ by regulating the s type anion channel _PROTEIN_ which mediates anion efflux and in turn activates the outward rectifying k out channel by _LOCATION_ depolarization . we applied steady state whole cell patch clamp techniques to analyze the activities of the s type anion channel . as shown figures and aba treatment increased s type anion currents in wild type guard cells did not apparently change the currents in _PROTEIN_ guard cells and only slightly increased the currents in _PROTEIN_ guard cells . the current activation in _PROTEIN_ was much lower than in the wild type but was higher than in _PROTEIN_ . we further showed that was able to activate the s type anion channel in the wild type and to a slightly lesser degree in _PROTEIN_ but not in _PROTEIN_ current activation in _PROTEIN_ was less than in the wild type or _PROTEIN_ but was higher than in _PROTEIN_ . these results suggest that aba and regulate the s type anion channel through _PROTEIN_ . researchers have identified many lrr _PROTEIN_ but few of their downstream substrates . to identify the substrate of _PROTEIN_ we tested the in vivo interaction of _PROTEIN_ with some known aba signaling components by using the firefly luciferase complementation imaging assay . we found that _PROTEIN_ was able to interact with _PROTEIN_ . deletion assays revealed that _PROTEIN_ interacted with the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ but not with other parts . the specific interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in vivo was verified by an immunoprecipitation assay in protoplasts . _PROTEIN_ flag or _PROTEIN_ flag _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ myc were transiently coexpressed in protoplasts . antibodies to flag could detect the proteins immunoprecipitated by myc antibodies _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ flag but not for _PROTEIN_ flag coexpression . similarly antibodies to myc _PROTEIN_ could detect the proteins immunoprecipitated by flag antibodies for _PROTEIN_ flag but not for _PROTEIN_ flag coexpression . when _PROTEIN_ myc was _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts the myc immunoprecipitated protein was able to phosphorylate the n terminus but not the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli suggesting that _PROTEIN_ phosphorylates _PROTEIN_ . aba and treatment did not further activate _PROTEIN_ overexpressed in protoplasts and did not influence the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as analyzed by coimmunoprecipitation or luciferase complementation suggesting that other partners are needed for aba or activation of _PROTEIN_ and/or that native _PROTEIN_ is inhibited by other proteins . a mutation of _PROTEIN_ would abolish the _PROTEIN_ binding of the _PROTEIN_ kinase domain and the mutated _PROTEIN_ did not have any phosphorylation activity on _PROTEIN_ . although _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are homologous proteins a previous genetic study indicates that _PROTEIN_ acts upstream and _PROTEIN_ acts downstream of synthesis in arabidopsis guard cells . we first tested whether _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ could interact with _PROTEIN_ by the firefly luciferase complementation imaging assay and found that _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ interacted with _PROTEIN_ . we verified the specific in vivo interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ by an immunoprecipitation assay in protoplasts . _PROTEIN_ myc and _PROTEIN_ flag or _PROTEIN_ myc and _PROTEIN_ flag were transiently coexpressed in protoplasts . antibodies to myc could detect the proteins immunoprecipitated by flag antibodies for coexpression of _PROTEIN_ flag and _PROTEIN_ myc but not for coexpression of _PROTEIN_ flag and _PROTEIN_ myc . similarly antibodies to flag could detect the proteins immunoprecipitated by myc antibodies for coexpression of _PROTEIN_ flag and _PROTEIN_ myc but not for coexpression of _PROTEIN_ flag and _PROTEIN_ myc . next we used xenopus oocytes a well established heterologous _PROTEIN_ system to test whether the _PROTEIN_ channel could be activated by _PROTEIN_ . based on previous results we comicroinjected _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ complementary rna with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ crna into oocytes and recorded the _PROTEIN_ currents . consistent with previous results macroscopic anion currents were not recorded when only _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ in oocytes . high _PROTEIN_ currents were recorded when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ crna or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ crna were coexpressed . to determine whether the kinase activity is needed to activate the _PROTEIN_ we also comicroinjected _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mutant that is unable to bind _PROTEIN_ into oocytes and did not record any currents indicating the requirement of _PROTEIN_ kinase activity for _PROTEIN_ . we were able to record _PROTEIN_ activity when native _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were coexpressed but only in a few oocytes which is similar to the observation of coexpression of native _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . we also noticed that the recorded currents varied among the oocytes taken from different individual xenopus and varied with the amount of crnas injected . for these reasons we confirmed our data through several independent experiments . the data presented here and below were recorded in the oocytes coming from the same individual xenopus that were injected with the same amount of crna . however no currents were detected in oocytes that were injected with only _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . it follows that the measured currents only reveal the relative _PROTEIN_ activity in oocytes . because _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ we tested whether _PROTEIN_ could negatively regulate _PROTEIN_ in oocytes . we noticed that coinjection of _PROTEIN_ crna with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ completely inhibited _PROTEIN_ activity in oocytes but coinjection of _PROTEIN_ crna only slightly inhibited the _PROTEIN_ activity suggesting that _PROTEIN_ inhibits _PROTEIN_ activity and that the slight inhibition of _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ might not be specific . it was previously shown that _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ and that the _PROTEIN_ mutation but not the _PROTEIN_ mutation strongly represses aba dependent _PROTEIN_ activation . comicroinjection of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ inhibited _PROTEIN_ activity in oocytes which is consistent with previous results . however _PROTEIN_ could also inhibit _PROTEIN_ activity suggesting that the results in oocytes may incorrectly reflect the biological role of _PROTEIN_ in vivo because the oocytes may be overloaded with _PROTEIN_ and because the system is heterologous . in a yeast two hybrid assay _PROTEIN_ also interacts with _PROTEIN_ but the strength of the interaction is less than that between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . citation also reported that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ inhibit the _PROTEIN_ mediated activation of _PROTEIN_ in oocytes while habs were not active . regulation of _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ but not by _PROTEIN_ and of _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ is supported by the genetic positions of these proteins in aba regulated stomatal movement .
