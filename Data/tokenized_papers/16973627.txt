the _PROTEIN_ kinases of arabidopsis are members of the eukaryotic pka pkg and pkc group of regulatory kinases . one _PROTEIN_ kinase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plays a fundamental role in the asymmetrical localization of _LOCATION_ proteins during _PROTEIN_ auxin transport . the remaining _PROTEIN_ genes have not been associated with single mutant phenotypes suggesting that the corresponding kinases function redundantly . consistent with this idea we find that the genes encoding the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ kinases have spatially distinct but overlapping _PROTEIN_ domains . here we show that the majority of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ kinases are substrates for the phosphoinositide dependent kinase _PROTEIN_ and that trans phosphorylation by _PROTEIN_ correlates with activation of substrate _PROTEIN_ kinases . mutational analysis of two conserved regulatory domains was used to demonstrate that sequences located outside of the c terminal _PROTEIN_ interaction _PROTEIN_ domain and the activation loop are required for functional interactions between _PROTEIN_ and its substrates . a subset of _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ kinases _PROTEIN_ in saccharomyces cerevisiae and tobacco by cells were preferentially localized to the cytoplasm _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the cell periphery _PROTEIN_ . we present evidence that _PROTEIN_ insertion domain sequences are sufficient to direct the observed peripheral localization . we find that _PROTEIN_ specifically but non selectively binds to phosphoinositides and phosphatidic acid suggesting that _PROTEIN_ might directly interact with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ through protein lipid interactions . the initial characterization of the _PROTEIN_ kinases presented here provides a framework for elucidating the physiological roles of these kinases in planta .
structure of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ kinase subfamily is comprised of seventeen predicted proteins that are randomly located throughout the arabidopsis genome . the kinases are grouped phylogenetically by both sequence similarity and the presence of several signature domains . in addition to the characteristic dfg to _PROTEIN_ substitution that is shared with the closely related _PROTEIN_ group these kinases are uniquely identified by the presence of an insertion domain located between catalytic subdomains vii and viii . this domain displays limited sequence similarity between closely related family members and ranges in size from to amino acids . other sequences common to the majority of the _PROTEIN_ kinases are a pair of motifs characteristic of mammalian _PROTEIN_ substrates . the first of these sequences is a hydrophobic c terminal domain called the _PROTEIN_ interacting fragment or _PROTEIN_ domain . in animals phosphorylation of the penultimate serine/threonine residue within the consensus _PROTEIN_ sequence fxxf is believed to be required for _PROTEIN_ docking . of annotated arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ kinases contain a c terminal sequence f xf similar but not identical to the abbreviated _PROTEIN_ variant found in mammalian pka . _PROTEIN_ contains the related sequence idff whereas the remaining three proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ do not display an obvious c terminal _PROTEIN_ like domain . in yeast and animals _PROTEIN_ phosphorylates its substrates on the first serine/threonine within a highly conserved activation loop sequence fcgtx yxape subsequent to _PROTEIN_ binding . a nearly identical sequence found in the plant _PROTEIN_ kinases differs from the consensus _PROTEIN_ target site only in the substitution of valine for cysteine at the third residue . two kinases _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ also contain a second amino acid substitution in which the phenylalanine at p is converted to cysteine . unlike the conserved catalytic kinase core which exhibits an average of amino acid identity among all family members the small insertion domains found in all _PROTEIN_ kinases are variable in sequence . however amino acid alignments reveal that the insertion domains loosely group into five clusters with higher levels of sequence homology . with the exception of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the kinases also share a region enriched in basic residues near the c terminal portion of the domain . a single kinase _PROTEIN_ contains a small acidic domain upstream of the basic region . although homology between individual clusters is limited the insertion domain sequences within a given cluster are conserved between arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ kinases and orthologous proteins in both monocot and dicotyledonous plant species . retention of the insertion domains by evolutionarily distant species and conservation of cluster specific sequences among higher plants indicates that these regions are likely to be important for kinase function . to assess functional differences or similarities between _PROTEIN_ and the homologues predicted by the annotated arabidopsis genome we have cloned cdnas corresponding to of the genes . we were unable to isolate a cdna for one homologue _PROTEIN_ . digital northern analysis indicates that transcription of this gene is restricted to root tissues and our inability to detect the transcript suggests that it may be _PROTEIN_ at low levels or in a restricted number of cells within the root . in vitro _PROTEIN_ binding and phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ animal _METHOD_ phosphorylation of numerous _PROTEIN_ kinases by the upstream regulator _PROTEIN_ induces conformational changes that permit autophosphorylation and activation of substrate kinases . in plants information _PROTEIN_ the role of _PROTEIN_ as a regulator of _PROTEIN_ kinase function is sparse . _PROTEIN_ has previously been shown to be activated by _PROTEIN_ in vitro and in vivo . two other arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ kinases _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were identified as _PROTEIN_ interactors in a yeast two hybrid screen . a single tomato kinase an inhibitor of regulated plant cell death has been shown to be a substrate for the tomato _PROTEIN_ kinase . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ is a candidate upstream regulator of other arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ kinases we examined the ability of these kinases to serve as substrates for _PROTEIN_ in vitro . pull down experiments using individual _PROTEIN_ tagged kinases bound to agarose beads and bacterial cell extracts containing his tagged _PROTEIN_ followed by western blot analysis using anti his antibody demonstrated that all of the kinases tested interact with _PROTEIN_ in vitro . _PROTEIN_ was not detectable in control assays using _PROTEIN_ only . the observation that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which lack an obvious _PROTEIN_ domain bind to _PROTEIN_ is consistent with previous experiments in which mutation of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domain failed to abolish _PROTEIN_ binding and persistent interaction of _PROTEIN_ with in co immunoprecipitation experiments following _PROTEIN_ domain mutation . these data confirm that the _PROTEIN_ domain of the _PROTEIN_ kinases is not absolutely required for _PROTEIN_ binding in vitro . we next examined changes in phosphorylation levels of the _PROTEIN_ proteins subsequent to _PROTEIN_ co incubation . as shown in fig . the majority of the kinases exhibit a dramatic increase in phosphorylation after incubation with _PROTEIN_ indicating that like its mammalian homologue arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ interacts with multiple _PROTEIN_ kinases . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which lack both the _PROTEIN_ domain and the activation loop p phenylalanine are not phosphorylated by _PROTEIN_ despite the _PROTEIN_ that both proteins bound efficiently to _PROTEIN_ in pull down assays . interestingly phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ which also lacks the c terminal _PROTEIN_ domain was stimulated by co incubation with _PROTEIN_ . closer inspection of the _PROTEIN_ amino acid sequence revealed a consensus _PROTEIN_ sequence amino acids upstream of the protein terminus . it is possible that this site functions as a cryptic _PROTEIN_ domain and may explain the increase in phosphorylation in response to _PROTEIN_ . unexpectedly _PROTEIN_ which contains both a c terminal _PROTEIN_ domain and a consensus signature sequence within the activation loop was not phosphorylated by _PROTEIN_ in vitro . _PROTEIN_ is the largest _PROTEIN_ kinase because of the presence of an n terminal extension . to rule out the possibility that this domain may contain additional regulatory sequences that affect _PROTEIN_ binding or activity we repeated the assays using an n terminal deletion construct . similar results were obtained using either the full length or truncated protein arguing that this extension does not have in vitro regulatory function . these data demonstrate that although the _PROTEIN_ domain appears to be a crucial element for regulation of the _PROTEIN_ kinases by _PROTEIN_ additional sequences must be required to enable _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation of substrates . _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation has been shown to trigger autocatalytic activation of substrate kinases . thus the increase in phosphorylation in response to _PROTEIN_ observed for the majority of the _PROTEIN_ kinases is likely to result both from direct phosphorylation by _PROTEIN_ and subsequent autophosphorylation . to correlate changes in the phosphorylation state of individual kinases with changes in kinase activity we assessed the ability of three kinases _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ that show increased phosphorylation after co incubation with _PROTEIN_ and one _PROTEIN_ which is not phosphorylated by _PROTEIN_ to phosphorylate the exogenous substrate mbp . as shown in fig . phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ resulted in fold increase in transphosphorylation . by contrast prior incubation of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ had no effect on its activity . collectively our data argue that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ is likely to be an important but not universal regulator of _PROTEIN_ kinase activity . functional analysis of _PROTEIN_ domain and activation loop peptide motifs the _PROTEIN_ domain and an activation loop containing phenylalanine at the p position are present in all _PROTEIN_ kinases that are activated by _PROTEIN_ . to assess the contribution of these motifs to _PROTEIN_ interaction and _PROTEIN_ kinase activity we introduced both motifs alone and in combination into the _PROTEIN_ kinase which is not an in vitro substrate for _PROTEIN_ . we first asked whether the addition of a _PROTEIN_ domain was sufficient to convert _PROTEIN_ into a substrate for _PROTEIN_ . somewhat surprisingly the addition of a c terminal _PROTEIN_ domain to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ stimulated kinase autophosphorylation even in the absence of _PROTEIN_ . co incubation of either construct with _PROTEIN_ resulted in a _PROTEIN_ in protein phosphorylation although levels remained elevated as compared with the wildtype protein . the observed _PROTEIN_ in phosphorylation in response to _PROTEIN_ co incubation was reflected in a concomitant _PROTEIN_ in the activity of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ toward mbp substrate . thus while addition of a _PROTEIN_ domain resulted in an overall increase in autophosphorylation the mechanism of _PROTEIN_ mediated activation appears to be largely independent of _PROTEIN_ function . we next asked whether conversion of the activation loop cysteine to phenylalanine alone or in tandem with the _PROTEIN_ domain resulted in increased phosphorylation of the modified protein by _PROTEIN_ . substituted _PROTEIN_ derivatives showed increased phosphorylation irrespective of the presence of _PROTEIN_ or the _PROTEIN_ domain . reciprocal experiments in which the conserved activation loop phenylalanine of _PROTEIN_ was replaced by cysteine _PROTEIN_ resulted in a small but reproducible _PROTEIN_ in phosphorylation as compared with wild type both before and after _PROTEIN_ stimulation . these data suggest that while the conserved phenylalanine enhances kinase autophosphorylation it is unlikely to function in _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation site recognition . collectively our data indicate that neither the _PROTEIN_ domain nor the activation loop phenylalanine alone or together are sufficient to confer _PROTEIN_ substrate identity . the _PROTEIN_ genes are differentially _PROTEIN_ used semi quantitative rt pcr analysis of rna extracted from seven adult tissue fractions and day old seedlings to examine the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ kinases . consistent with our inability to clone the _PROTEIN_ cdna we were unable to reproducibly detect a transcript for the hypothetical gene in any of the tissues tested . the other sixteen kinases showed a spectrum of _PROTEIN_ patterns . with the exception of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ all of the kinases appear to be _PROTEIN_ in young seedlings . in adult tissues _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which group tightly in both whole protein and insertion sequence alignments were ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ in all tissues examined . the closely related gene _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in all tissues except rosette and cauline leaves . in contrast _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ only in certain aerial tissues including the inflorescence flowers and siliques . another closely related gene pair _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ also showed a nearly identical _PROTEIN_ pattern with both genes _PROTEIN_ in all tissues with the possible exception of rosette leaves and having highest _PROTEIN_ in the inflorescence . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which are also phylogenetically paired had overlapping _PROTEIN_ domains . _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in flowers inflorescences roots and siliques while _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was limited to flowers inflorescences and roots . the subclade containing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ displayed a highly divergent _PROTEIN_ pattern . whereas _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in all tissues _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ appeared to be restricted to flowers and roots whereas in adult tissues _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was observed only faintly in the root . _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in all adult tissues whereas _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was excluded from leaves _METHOD_ and siliques . in adult tissues _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was restricted to inflorescences and to a lesser extent to flowers . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was not observed in any of the adult tissues examined . consistent with its loss of function phenotype _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was found primarily in inflorescences and flowers with only trace levels detectable in other adult tissues . subcellular localization of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ determine whether _PROTEIN_ kinases are differential distributed within the cell we examined the localization of fulllength _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ . because exogenous _PROTEIN_ of regulatory proteins in plants often results in low protein yield cell and tissue lethality and the co suppression of native and exogenous genes we first addressed subcellular kinase localization by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions in s. cerevisiae . visualization of _METHOD_ in yeast following induction of transgene _PROTEIN_ revealed that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ showed cytoplasmic localization indistinguishable from that observed for the _METHOD_ only control . by contrast _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were predominantly _LOCATION_ . the apparent _LOCATION_ localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in yeast is similar to that observed after transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in onion epidermal _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in a manner similar to that observed following in planta _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ under the control of the root hair specific _PROTEIN_ promoter . additional punctate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was observed within cytoplasmic structures suggesting that _PROTEIN_ may also accumulate in one or more endomembrane compartments . alternatively the punctate _PROTEIN_ may result from artifactual protein aggregation . to confirm that the observed subcellular localization reflected biologically significant protein interactions as opposed to nonspecific binding with yeast cellular components we transformed tobacco by cell cultures with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the resulting localization patterns were similar to those observed in yeast transformants confirming that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are preferentially localized to the cytoplasm and cell periphery respectively . we next asked whether the observed localization of _PROTEIN_ relied on prior activation by _PROTEIN_ . a mutant _METHOD_ fusion construct _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in yeast . in this mutant the two activation loop serines required for _PROTEIN_ activation of _PROTEIN_ were replaced by alanine . the resulting protein which has only low levels of basal activity exhibited a localization pattern identical to that of the wild type protein indicating that phosphorylation by _PROTEIN_ is not required for proper protein localization . the _PROTEIN_ insertion domain mediates subcellular examine which protein domains contribute to differences in spatial distribution we performed domain swapping experiments utilizing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ which localizes to the cell periphery and cytoplasmically _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . an amino acid _PROTEIN_ fragment containing the entire insertion domain and amino acids of the highly conserved flanking catalytic domain was replaced with the corresponding region of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ of this construct _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in yeast and tobacco by cells resulted in cytoplasmic localization of the fusion protein . _PROTEIN_ of the reciprocal fusion construct _PROTEIN_ in which the _PROTEIN_ insertion domain was fused to the and regions of _PROTEIN_ resulted in a peripheral localization pattern identical to that of intact _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . to determine whether the insertion domain was sufficient to direct protein distribution within the cell we transformed yeast with an insertion domain construct fused to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the localization of the insertion domain alone was indistinguishable from that of the full length protein indicating that sequences outside of this region are not essential for protein localization . the peripheral localization of _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ chimera indicates that these proteins might contact transmembrane or _LOCATION_ associated proteins . alternatively they may bind directly to lipid moieties . we used lipid protein overlay to determine whether _PROTEIN_ associates with biologically active lipids . we find that _PROTEIN_ binds specifically but not selectively to all phosphorylated inositides tested including _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and to phosphatidic acid _PROTEIN_ . this result suggests that the observed peripheral localization of _PROTEIN_ within the cell may occur through direct _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ binding .
