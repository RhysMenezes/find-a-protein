endocytosis plays an important role in plant physiology but how endocytic organelles are organized remains unknown . we present the evidence that endosomes are functionally differentiated in arabidopsis cells . two types of related _PROTEIN_ are localized on distinct population of endosomes in a partially overlapping manner . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are on an early type of endosomes with _PROTEIN_ where recycling of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins occurs . in contrast the plant unique _PROTEIN_ resides on distinct endosomes with the prevacuolar snares . partially overlapping localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with reciprocal gradients suggests maturation of endosomes from one to the other .
we previously reported that _PROTEIN_ is localized on the subpopulation of endosomes stained by which is a tracer of the endocytic pathway . to examine whether other homologs _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are also on the subpopulation of endosomes or not we stained arabidopsis suspension cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ with . as indicated in figure _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was always observed on a subpopulation of dotty organelles stained by this dye as in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . this indicates that plant endosomes are heterogeneous and perhaps differentiated . to examine whether these homologs are on the same population of endosomes or not they were tagged with different colors of _METHOD_ proteins _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis cells and observed with a color ccd camera . when _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ and monomeric red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ were simultaneously _PROTEIN_ in the same cells rapidly moving punctate organelles were observed with various colors in the cells . interestingly most of them bore intermediate colors between red and green such as orange yellow or yellowish green whereas red and green dots were also observed . a similar result was observed when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were coexpressed but the coexpression of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ gave only yellow staining indicating that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are on the same population of endosomes . these results indicate that the endosomes in arabidopsis cells differentiate into at least two populations and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are localized on partially overlapping but different populations of endosomes with reciprocal gradients . to further clarify the differentiation of endosomes we employed snare molecules as another type of organelle markers . the arabidopsis genome contains genes encoding snares some of which have already been characterized . first we examined whether known snare proteins colocalize with any of the related proteins . the snare members were tagged with venus a modified bright version of the yellow _METHOD_ protein and rab _PROTEIN_ were tagged with _METHOD_ . neither _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ nor _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ colocalized with any related proteins ruling out the involvement of these organelles . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are known to localize and function in the prevacuolar compartment a synonym of _PROTEIN_ endosomes . when venus tagged _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis cells these _METHOD_ chimeric proteins are also observed on punctate organelles _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the majority of these punctate organelles are neither _LOCATION_ nor tgn because venus _PROTEIN_ or venus _PROTEIN_ rarely colocalize with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . as shown in figure these pvc snares showed good colocalization only with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ but not with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ resides on _PROTEIN_ endosomes . this observation also _METHOD_ that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are on different populations of endosomes . which snare protein colocalizes with _PROTEIN_ then ? to answer this question we systematically analyzed the subcellular localization of all arabidopsis snare proteins and found that one member of the vamp family _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a localization pattern very similar to that of related proteins . when arabidopsis cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were stained by _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localized on a subpopulation of stained organelles as in related _PROTEIN_ . thus we coexpressed venus _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ tagged in arabidopsis cells . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ colocalized well with this snare protein whereas a small population of _PROTEIN_ residing endosomes still overlapped with _PROTEIN_ . the next important question is how these two types of endosomes could functionally differentiate in plant cells . the arabidopsis gnom mutant gave us a clue on this issue . the gnom mutant plants display pleiotropic defects among which the anomaly in pattern formation along the apical basal axis is remarkable . some severe gnom alleles show a complete loss of the apical basal axis and form a round embryo . _PROTEIN_ encodes a gdp/gtp exchange _PROTEIN_ for the arf _PROTEIN_ . arf _PROTEIN_ regulates vesicle formation and sorting of cargo molecules in multiple steps of vesicular traffic including endocytosis in yeast and mammalian cells . guanine nucleotide exchange is an essential step for the activation of this molecule . _PROTEIN_ and some other members of the arf gef family are known as targets of a widely used inhibitor of vesicular traffic brefeldin a . by the use of a bfa resistant mutant version _PROTEIN_ has recently been demonstrated to reside on endosomes and be essential for the recycling of an auxin efflux regulator _PROTEIN_ . contrary to the severe growth arrest of the gnom mutant plants the suspension cultured cells generated from the gnom mutant proliferate normally like wild type cells . this provided us with a useful recycling defective cell line to investigate the functional differentiation of endocytic organelles in arabidopsis . in the gnom mutant cells _PROTEIN_ positive endosomes lose their fine dotty shape and appear as larger patches or clustering _PROTEIN_ shape structures . this suggests that the _PROTEIN_ positive endosomes are the site of _PROTEIN_ dependent recycling of pm proteins such as _PROTEIN_ . as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ colocalize with _PROTEIN_ they are also expected to localize on the abnormally deformed endosomes when _PROTEIN_ in gnom mutant cells . this was indeed the case as shown in figure . in contrast _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was found on such abnormal endosomes much less frequently once again consistent with the distinct nature of the two types of endosomes . other organelle markers _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ showed indistinguishable subcellular localization patterns in gnom and wild type cells . from these observations we conclude that the organelle where _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ residing is the sole place where _PROTEIN_ dependent traffic takes place . as described above _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are enriched in the same type of endosomes which is distinct from _PROTEIN_ rich endosomes . _PROTEIN_ rich endosomes are likely to be located at a _PROTEIN_ stage of the endocytic pathway because _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are reported to function in _LOCATION_ fusion in _PROTEIN_ endosomes and/or the _LOCATION_ in the _LOCATION_ transport pathway . studies of yeast cells show that the endocytic pathway merges with the _LOCATION_ transport pathway at _PROTEIN_ endosomes prior to reaching the _LOCATION_ the final destination of the endocytic pathway . in plants the routes of endocytosis and _LOCATION_ transport merge at the pvc . the _PROTEIN_ rich endosomes probably represent an earlier compartment which is important for recycling to the pm . these two functionally different endosomes are morphologically indistinguishable at the confocal microscope level and the two types of homologs partially colocalize in various ratios on these endosomes . these findings imply that the two differentiated populations of endosomes are not completely stable compartments but can gradually change their components and properties as is the case of _LOCATION_ cisternae proposed in the cisternal maturation model . the partial functional overlap of the two types of endosomes may also explain the apparent discrepancy between our results and those recently published by citation . they showed that the overexpression of the gdp freeze form of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ blocks the transport of sporamin _METHOD_ and aleurain _METHOD_ to the _LOCATION_ and causes their missecretion and proposed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ regulate the transport between the pvc and the _LOCATION_ . although only limited populations of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were found on the pvc it is possible that they still play an important role in the function of _PROTEIN_ endosomes/pvc which may be perturbed by the gdp freeze version of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . alternatively the apparent discrepancy in our results may be due to differences in cell type protein markers _PROTEIN_ strategies and so on in the experimental _METHOD_ used . dynamic rearrangement of rab _PROTEIN_ on endosomes has also been discussed for mammalian endosomes . multiple combinations of three endocytic rab _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ compose three major domains on a continuous endosome one that contains only and others with and or and _PROTEIN_ . functions in the transport from the pm to early endosomes and the homotypic fusion of early endosomes . on the contrary and _PROTEIN_ are implicated in the fast recycling pathway from early endosomes and rather slow recycling from recycling endosomes respectively . the absence of homologs in plants suggests that plant cells have evolved a unique system for rapid recycling between early endosomes and the pm . the _PROTEIN_ rich population of endosomes where _PROTEIN_ dependent recycling takes place may represent the functional counterpart of the recycling domain of early endosomes where functions in mammalian cells . it has been proposed for animal endosomes that the divalent effector proteins of rab _PROTEIN_ are central components of the machinery regulating the subcompartmental organization . studies of effector molecules for the family proteins in plants will provide clues to unveil how and why the reciprocal distribution of these molecules are established and _PROTEIN_ . in addition to the arabidopsis genome lacks homologs which are known to regulate traffic from _PROTEIN_ endosomes to the tgn in mammalian cells . by contrast many diverse members of arabidopsis rabs are scored as _PROTEIN_ homologs . considering this unique composition of plant rab proteins and their unique distribution together with the unique property of the _LOCATION_ system endocytic and post _LOCATION_ transport pathways in plant cells should be organized and operated in a different manner from other _METHOD_ . such unique features in vesicular traffic in plants may serve as the molecular basis of plant unique functions of a higher order such as responses to environment establishment of body axis and organogenesis . in the experiments presented here we used _METHOD_ protein tagged rab and snare proteins as organelle markers . we were aware of the possibility that overexpression of such fusion proteins might cause mislocalization . however as already published _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is correctly localized on the same organelles as endogenous _PROTEIN_ . the localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is also indistinguishable from the endogenous _PROTEIN_ . furthermore _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ complements the defect of gravitropism of the _PROTEIN_ mutant indicating that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is fully functional in vivo . many published results with yeast and mammalian cells demonstrate that rabs and snares tagged with _METHOD_ or its analogs can remain functional and show proper localization if the experiments are performed carefully . it is not always easy to prove that every fusion protein used is completely functional but we should avoid artifact of overproduction as much as possible for example by looking at only weakly or moderately _METHOD_ cells .
