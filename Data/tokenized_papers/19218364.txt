the circadian clock is an endogenous mechanism that coordinates biological processes with daily and seasonal changes in the environment . heterodimerization of central clock components is an important way of controlling clock function in several different circadian _METHOD_ . circadian _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ elongated hypocotyl _PROTEIN_ are myb related proteins that function in or close to the central oscillator in arabidopsis . single mutants of _PROTEIN_ and lhy have a phenotype of short period _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ lhy double mutants show an even shorter period phenotype than the _PROTEIN_ single mutant suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are only partially functionally redundant . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ act in parallel or synergistically in the circadian clock we examined their _PROTEIN_ in both light grown and etiolated seedlings . we have shown that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ bind to the same region of the promoter of a light harvesting chlorophyll a/b protein . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ can form homodimers and they also colocalize in the _LOCATION_ and heterodimerize in vitro and in vivo . in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ physically interact in a manner independent of photoperiod . moreover results from gel filtration chromatography indicate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are present in the same large complex in plants . taken together these results imply that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function synergistically in regulating circadian _METHOD_ of arabidopsis .
_PROTEIN_ and lhy single loss of function mutants confer short periods and an initial study showed that a _PROTEIN_ lhy double loss of function mutant _PROTEIN_ is unable to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ of clock controlled rnas for more than a few cycles under constant light . however the lhy allele used in that study was not truly null because a truncated _PROTEIN_ protein is still _PROTEIN_ . therefore it is possible that the truncated _PROTEIN_ retained partial clock associated function in the _PROTEIN_ lhy double mutant . we therefore set out to test whether plants that are completely null for both the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins are able to sustain rhythmicity in ll . the _PROTEIN_ circadian reporter was introduced into wild type wassilewskija _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lhy that is completely missing both proteins seedlings by transformation . figure demonstrates that the _PROTEIN_ rhythm in _PROTEIN_ lhy seedlings persists for at least d in ll . although some initial dampening _PROTEIN_ was evident in the double mutant the rhythm stabilized after three to four cycles . this is in contrast to reports that indicate _METHOD_ dampen out completely in the double mutants . compared to the _PROTEIN_ single mutant which displayed a short period phenotype the _PROTEIN_ lhy double mutant exhibits reduced amplitude as well as a very short period of _PROTEIN_ rhythm . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are required for sustaining robust _METHOD_ and proper period in ll however in their absence other presumably closely related proteins can partially replace this function . the short period of the single _PROTEIN_ mutant and the additive period phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ lhy double mutant indicate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are only partially redundant in which case they might function in parallel and/or work together in regulating circadian _METHOD_ . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ rhythmically with peaks of _PROTEIN_ occurring soon after dawn in plants grown under diurnal conditions or transferred to ll . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function in parallel or synergistically their tissue specific _PROTEIN_ was examined . different arabidopsis tissues from light grown plants were harvested at h after dawn when _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are most abundant and quantitative real time pcr was used to measure their levels of _PROTEIN_ . figure shows that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ at higher levels in leaves and _METHOD_ compared to roots inflorescences and siliques . although _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have similar _PROTEIN_ patterns in different tissues _PROTEIN_ is generally more highly _PROTEIN_ than _PROTEIN_ . in etiolated seedlings _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ at very low levels but light can induce _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to examine whether _PROTEIN_ could be regulated by light and the circadian clock in a similar manner to _PROTEIN_ in etiolated seedlings we compared the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in etiolated seedlings treated with a brief exposure to red light . this experimental approach allows the acute response to light and the circadian response to be separated . arabidopsis seedlings were grown for d in the dark exposed to min of r and tissue was harvested at various times up to h following r exposure . consistent with previous reports both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrna levels increased within h and peaked at h after r treatment demonstrating that light induces both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in etiolated seedlings . following the acute response to light the _PROTEIN_ of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrnas reached trough levels in approximately h and rose transiently to peak at approximately h after r treatment . the second peak is most likely due to the action of an endogenous circadian oscillator . this result demonstrates that both light and the circadian clock regulate the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in a similar way in etiolated seedlings . taken together the results indicate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have similar _PROTEIN_ patterns in both light grown plants and etiolated seedlings . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ show similar regulation by light and the circadian clock . in addition _PROTEIN_ mediates activation of light harvesting chlorophyll a/b protein genes by binding directly to their promoters . it has previously been shown that the myb domain of _PROTEIN_ interacts with two closely spaced binding sites in the _PROTEIN_ promoter . the extensive similarity between the myb domains of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins prompted us to examine whether _PROTEIN_ can bind to the same regions of the _PROTEIN_ promoter as _PROTEIN_ . figure shows the results from a representative electrophoretic mobility shift assay _METHOD_ using escherichia coli produced _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins and wild type and mutant promoter fragments of _PROTEIN_ as probes . dna binding activities were observed for both proteins using the wild type fragment of the _PROTEIN_ promoter . this fragment was used previously to characterize _PROTEIN_ binding ability . the mutated fragment carries several point mutations spanning both _PROTEIN_ binding sites in the _PROTEIN_ promoter . these mutations were previously shown to abolish binding of _PROTEIN_ to the wild type fragment . as shown in figure the altered nucleotides of the fragment also completely abolished the binding of _PROTEIN_ . to characterize the _PROTEIN_ binding site on the _PROTEIN_ promoter in more detail we carried out phenanthroline copper footprinting analysis . we have previously used this method to characterize _PROTEIN_ binding to the same fragment of the _PROTEIN_ promoter . after performing an _METHOD_ to resolve the dna protein complexes the gel was treated with phenanthroline copper and the dna in the two complexes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was recovered and resolved in a sequencing gel . as shown in figure in complex _PROTEIN_ the to region was protected and in complex _PROTEIN_ regions from to and from to were protected . this result suggests that the two complexes of different mobilities are a result of the presence of two separate binding sites on this fragment and that the to region probably is the higher affinity binding site for _PROTEIN_ . a similar observation in which one complex has a larger protected region than the other was also made in _PROTEIN_ footprinting analysis . figure summarizes the results from the phenanthroline copper footprinting and compares the regions of the wild type fragment protected by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . these results demonstrate that the two proteins bind to the same region of the _PROTEIN_ promoter . in drosophila cyc heterodimerizes with dclk and activates the transcription of per and _PROTEIN_ through binding to the e boxes of the per and _PROTEIN_ promoters . because _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ bind to the same region of the _PROTEIN_ promoter we investigated whether _PROTEIN_ heterodimerizes with _PROTEIN_ using a reciprocal interaction assay . glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ fusions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were immobilized on glutathione agarose beads and incubated with met labeled _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ synthesized by in vitro transcription translation . luc was used as a control . figure shows that in the presence of either _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but not with _PROTEIN_ alone both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins synthesized in vitro were efficiently bound while luc was not bound by either of the two _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins . these results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ not only homodimerize but can also form a heterodimer in vitro . to identify the region of _PROTEIN_ that is responsible for interacting with _PROTEIN_ we carried out interaction assays using met labeled _PROTEIN_ synthesized in vitro and various deletion constructs of _PROTEIN_ fused to _PROTEIN_ . figure shows that in the presence of immobilized _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ proteins lacking either the or n terminal amino acids of _PROTEIN_ or a amino acid portion from the c terminus _PROTEIN_ could not be efficiently bound . taken together these data suggest that a region of _PROTEIN_ between amino acids and is important for interaction with _PROTEIN_ . it is worth mentioning that the _PROTEIN_ interactive domain of _PROTEIN_ lies outside the dna binding myb domain . to examine the homodimerization of _PROTEIN_ in vivo we carried out in vivo transient _PROTEIN_ in nicotiana benthamiana . _PROTEIN_ constructs of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were coinfiltrated into n. benthamiana and total protein was extracted from infiltrated leaves . immunoprecipitation with anti _METHOD_ antibody and subsequent detection of myc _PROTEIN_ using anti myc antibody showed that anti _METHOD_ antibodies not only immunoprecipitate _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ but also coimmunoprecipitate myc _PROTEIN_ . to examine the homodimerization of _PROTEIN_ in vivo similar immunoprecipitation was performed using anti _METHOD_ antibodies with total protein extracts from n. benthamiana leaves coexpressing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and haemagglutinin _PROTEIN_ . figure shows that ha _PROTEIN_ is coprecipitated with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . these results indicate that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ can homodimerize in vivo . because both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have been reported in the _LOCATION_ in plants we first examined whether they colocalize in vivo . _PROTEIN_ constructs of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ ha were coinfiltrated into n. benthamiana . confocal microscopy results show that both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are localized in the _LOCATION_ and their _PROTEIN_ overlaps . to verify the heterodimerization between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ myc _PROTEIN_ and ha _PROTEIN_ were coexpressed in n. benthamiana . immunoprecipitation with anti _PROTEIN_ antibody and subsequent detection of myc _PROTEIN_ showed that _PROTEIN_ interacts strongly with _PROTEIN_ in vivo . we extended these trials to test different regions of _PROTEIN_ and found that a region of _PROTEIN_ between amino acids and is important for interaction with _PROTEIN_ in vivo . protein product from one of the _PROTEIN_ deletion constructs _PROTEIN_ can only be detected by anti _PROTEIN_ antibody but not anti myc antibody indicating that the myc tag may be cleaved off from _PROTEIN_ protein . as expected protein products from _PROTEIN_ c terminal deletion constructs _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are not recognized by anti _PROTEIN_ antibody which is generated against the c terminal portion of the _PROTEIN_ protein . taken together the results support the in vitro findings demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ colocalize in the _LOCATION_ and the region of _PROTEIN_ downstream of the myb domain contains the determinants for _PROTEIN_ interactions in planta . the physical interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was also observed in wild type arabidopsis . immunoprecipitation was performed using anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies with total extracts from week old seedlings grown in h light h darkness and harvested at zt and zt . figure shows that _PROTEIN_ coprecipitated with _PROTEIN_ and their interaction is not light dependent in arabidopsis . to further determine whether _PROTEIN_ interaction is affected by photoperiod wild type col arabidopsis plants grown in were harvested at different times and a similar immunoprecipitation was conducted . the amount of _PROTEIN_ immunoprecipitated and the amount of _PROTEIN_ coimmunoprecipitated were correlated with the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ levels in the total extract suggesting that _PROTEIN_ can interact with _PROTEIN_ whenever they both are present . similar results were obtained when arabidopsis plants were grown in ll and harvested at different circadian times . these data demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ physically interact in a manner independent of photoperiod in plants . to examine whether the interaction of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is stable in plants gel filtration chromatography was performed using total extract from wild type arabidopsis which was prepared from week old seedlings grown in and harvested at zt . we expected to observe heterodimers of about kd . surprisingly we were unable to detect any monomers or heterodimers of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ monomers are predicted to be and kd respectively but migrate at and kd respectively when subject to electrophoresis in denaturing conditions . we found that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are present in a large complex .to determine whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are present in the same complex fractions and were subjected to the immunoprecipitation with anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies . _PROTEIN_ coprecipitated with _PROTEIN_ in those fractions indicating that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are present in the same large complex . this observation suggests that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ could function as part of a complex and work cooperatively with other proteins in regulating circadian _METHOD_ .
