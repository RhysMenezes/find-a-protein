the apical domain of the embryo is partitioned into distinct regions that will give rise to the cotyledons and the shoot apical meristem . in this article we describe a novel screen to identify arabidopsis thaliana embryo arrest mutants that are defective in this partitioning and we describe the phenotype of one such mutant . mutants arrest at the globular stage of development they _PROTEIN_ the meristem specific shootmeristemless gene throughout the top half of the embryo and they fail to _PROTEIN_ the aintegumenta transcript normally found in cotyledons . thus is required to limit the extent of the meristem domain and/or to promote the development of the cotyledon domains . based on _PROTEIN_ of early markers for apical development mutants differentiate protodermis and undergo normal early apical development . consistent with a role for auxin in cotyledon development mutants fail to _PROTEIN_ localized maxima of the green _METHOD_ protein reporter . encodes a protein with homology to the aspergillus nidulans protein nudc that has similarity to protein chaperones indicating a possible role for in synthesis or transport of proteins involved in patterning the arabidopsis embryo .
with the goal of isolating embryo lethal mutants that are defective in partitioning the apical domain of the embryo we mutagenized a line carrying a reporter for the _PROTEIN_ locus . this reporter _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ enzyme marker in the developing sam . the reporter is not _PROTEIN_ throughout the sam but is excluded from the central region of the developing meristem . following ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis seeds were harvested from individual plants and planted to soil . a total of independent embryo arrest mutants occurring in families were identified . arrested embryos developing in the siliques of plants were dissected out of the ovules when siblings were at heart stage and stained with gus staining solution . in of siliques segregating embryo arrests neither the wild type nor the arrested embryos showed gus _PROTEIN_ presumably reflecting silencing of the transgene . among those siliques where the transgene remained active embryo arrest mutants were found to have ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ gus while embryo arrest mutants failed to _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ gus reporter . in all cases the wild type siblings of the arrested embryos _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gus in the wild type fashion . mutant embryos ectopically _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed a range of phenotypes with _PROTEIN_ both to stage of arrest and to pattern of ectopic _PROTEIN_ . most ectopically _PROTEIN_ mutants formed cotyledons flanking a broader domain of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . a few mutants showed ectopic _PROTEIN_ and arrested at the globular stage examples of such mutant embryos are shown in figure . one type of mutant _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ reporter throughout the top half of the globular embryo . a second type of mutant _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ reporter throughout the globular embryo . a third type of mutant _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ reporter in a hypertrophied suspensor . of the mutants that failed to _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ gus reporter most arrested at the globular stage . a minority of the nonexpressing class of embryo arrest mutants developed past the globular stage . because _PROTEIN_ reporter _PROTEIN_ does not begin in the wild type until the _PROTEIN_ globular or transition stage a globular arrest mutant that fails to _PROTEIN_ the reporter may do so because it is blocked in its development and has not matured to the stage at which _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ . alternatively it may do so due to a patterning defect such as failure to specify a sam domain . because we can not distinguish between these two possibilities we chose to focus on an ectopically _PROTEIN_ line for in depth study rather than a nonexpressing line . one of the mutants isolated from the screen was _PROTEIN_ an embryo arrest mutant that fails to develop past the globular stage of embryogenesis . _PROTEIN_ mutants arrest consistently at the globular stage of embryogenesis never morphologically developing to the transition stage . _PROTEIN_ mutants account for of embryos in the self progeny of heterozygous individuals consistent with a recessive mutation in a single _LOCATION_ gene . the initial assay for _PROTEIN_ gus reporter _PROTEIN_ in a _PROTEIN_ mutant embryo revealed that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ normally confined to a few cells in the middle of the apical portion of the embryo is _PROTEIN_ throughout the apical half of _PROTEIN_ embryos . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ begins in wild type embryos at the _PROTEIN_ globular or transition stage . by the time wild type siblings have reached early heart stage _PROTEIN_ mutant embryos have begun to _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ gus reporter . in situ hybridization experiments on siliques from plants heterozygous for the _PROTEIN_ mutation using an antisense _PROTEIN_ probe confirm that _PROTEIN_ is ectopically _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ embryos . _PROTEIN_ in the entire apical hemisphere of the globular embryo indicates that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in cells that would normally be specified as cotyledon tissue . bob mutant embryos can reliably be distinguished from their wild type siblings beginning when the wild type embryos are at heart stage . in siliques of _PROTEIN_ plants one quarter of the embryos remain at early globular stages while none do so in siliques on / sibling plants . _PROTEIN_ the presumed homozygous _PROTEIN_ embryos have normal division patterns at the and cell stage . in older bob embryos cells of the epidermal layer are seen to bulge outward . additional cell divisions take place in bob embryos but the embryos never make the transition to a heart shape and instead remain globular in shape . although _PROTEIN_ mutant embryos arrest at the globular stage they do not die at this point . experiments that rely on the continued ability of _PROTEIN_ embryos to _PROTEIN_ undegraded rna and protein _PROTEIN_ indicate that they remain viable until the time that the wild type embryos in the silique mature and desiccate . to test if _PROTEIN_ embryos would recover and restart their development if given enough time we placed arrested _PROTEIN_ embryos on three different types of tissue culture media and evaluated their reactions . _PROTEIN_ embryos were dissected from their seed coats when wild type siblings were at the bent cot stage . although the wild type siblings placed on fisher and li media grew and became wild type looking seedlings none of the _PROTEIN_ embryos on any of the media ever grew or developed any further . to test if ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is the only defect in _PROTEIN_ mutant embryos _PROTEIN_ plants were crossed to stm plants . because stm/stm plants survive through embryogenesis if ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ were the only defect in _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ stm double mutants should survive embryogenesis and have the phenotype of stm single mutants . in that case plants heterozygous for both _PROTEIN_ and stm should segregate _PROTEIN_ embryos . if however ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ were not the only defect in _PROTEIN_ mutants removing _PROTEIN_ function should have no impact on the _PROTEIN_ arrest phenotype all _PROTEIN_ individuals should segregate _PROTEIN_ embryos _PROTEIN_ of their _PROTEIN_ genotype . the self progeny of progeny from four different _PROTEIN_ by stm crosses were examined and the number of _PROTEIN_ and wild type embryos recorded . _PROTEIN_ individuals accounted for of the embryos in the siliques of all of the _PROTEIN_ stm individuals combined . testing reveals that the hypothesis of segregation of _PROTEIN_ embryos must be rejected but that a hypothesis can not be rejected . therefore removing _PROTEIN_ function from _PROTEIN_ mutant embryos does not rescue the embryo arrest phenotype the defect in _PROTEIN_ mutants is not simply the overexpression of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is required along with _PROTEIN_ for meristem formation and cotyledon separation in the arabidopsis embryo . _PROTEIN_ mrna _PROTEIN_ precedes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and is required for the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ transcript in the embryo . to determine if the pattern of _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ as well as that of _PROTEIN_ is affected in _PROTEIN_ embryos we examined the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mutant embryos . our results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is first _PROTEIN_ in the entirety of the apical region of the wild type cell stage embryo . this is earlier and more extensive than has been reported previously . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ clears out of the protoderm layer at around the cell stage ultimately becoming limited to a stripe across the apical half of the globular embryo . viewed in frontal section the _PROTEIN_ appears to be confined to the cells of the presumptive meristem . viewed in the sagittal plane however _PROTEIN_ mrna is present in a band across the apical half of the embryo . this band of _PROTEIN_ represents the portion of the embryo that will become the sam and the boundaries separating the cotyledon margins . the areas free of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the globular embryo represent portions of the apical domain that will grow out as cotyledons . in _PROTEIN_ mutant embryos _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is initially similar to that seen in wild type embryos it accumulates throughout the apical domain of the cell stage embryo and then becomes limited to the subepidermal cells of the _PROTEIN_ globular stage embryo . however further limiting of _PROTEIN_ to a central stripe separating two cotyledon domains does not appear to occur and the _PROTEIN_ domain of _PROTEIN_ may be slightly expanded relative to that of the wild type . in summary _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is expanded in _PROTEIN_ mutant embryos but is less affected than the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . the exclusion of _PROTEIN_ from the epidermis in both wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant embryos indicates that the specification and early development of the protoderm is normal in _PROTEIN_ mutant embryos . to further test this we examined the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ thaliana meristem layer _PROTEIN_ mrna in wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant embryos . the _PROTEIN_ gene encodes a transcription _PROTEIN_ in the hdzipiv class . some members of this family have been implicated in the establishment and _PROTEIN_ of the epidermis . consistent with this the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pattern distinguishes the outer cell layer from internal layers beginning at the dermatogen stage . in _PROTEIN_ mutant embryos _PROTEIN_ mrna accumulates normally . therefore formation of the protoderm layer of the embryo does not appear to be affected by the _PROTEIN_ mutation . the expanded domain of _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ suggests that _PROTEIN_ embryos are defective in specification of the cotyledon primordia . to test this we examined _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ mrna in wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant embryos . the _PROTEIN_ gene is _PROTEIN_ in all the _PROTEIN_ organs of the plant including the cotyledons in the embryo . it therefore provides a good marker for cotyledon fate . wild type embryos begin _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ transcript at the _PROTEIN_ globular stage of embryogenesis in a _PROTEIN_ around the periphery of the apical half of the embryo reflecting the establishment of radial symmetry in the apical region of the embryo . _PROTEIN_ continues throughout embryogenesis becoming confined to internal tissues of the cotyledons _PROTEIN_ in embryogenesis . the _PROTEIN_ transcript was not detected in _PROTEIN_ embryos consistent with a defect in the developmental program that specifies cotyledon fate . like _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ gene is required for the normal establishment of the sam during embryogenesis . however _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in a pattern that is distinct from that of either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . in wild type embryos the _PROTEIN_ transcript accumulates from the cell stage throughout embryogenesis first appearing in all nonprotoderm cells of the apical embryo then in a progressively smaller region as cell divisions narrow its pattern to a final _PROTEIN_ domain that is one to two cells wide and one cell deep in the layer of the sam in the mature embryo . accumulation of low levels of the _PROTEIN_ transcript can be seen in _PROTEIN_ embryos in variable positions . a small region of _PROTEIN_ is typically seen somewhere in the apical domain of the embryo . this region is often off center . it appears that the mrna accumulates in a slightly different position in each embryo as if the positional cues _PROTEIN_ needs for correct localization are disrupted or destabilized . however unlike _PROTEIN_ the number of cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is not increased . unusual floral organs _PROTEIN_ appears in a subset of meristem cells beginning around the early heart stage of embryogenesis . its _PROTEIN_ in the embryo is confined to the cells of the presumptive sam . by the torpedo stage _PROTEIN_ is narrowed to a cup shaped subdomain within the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domain . although initially _PROTEIN_ in both protodermal and subepidermal regions by the _PROTEIN_ heart stage _PROTEIN_ is restricted to layers below the . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the embryo requires _PROTEIN_ function and _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ ectopically in _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants indicating that _PROTEIN_ is a target perhaps direct of _PROTEIN_ regulation . while the role of _PROTEIN_ in the embryo if any is unknown it provides a marker for events downstream of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mutants but in a manner that suggests that the positional cues _PROTEIN_ needs for proper _PROTEIN_ are disrupted . the intensity and area of _PROTEIN_ are variable from embryo to embryo . _PROTEIN_ is largely if not entirely confined to the protoderm in the apical portion of the embryo . thus as in the wild type _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is limited to a subdomain of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells which is consistent with a requirement for _PROTEIN_ plus another _PROTEIN_ in activating _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . recently directed transport of auxin into the cotyledon domains has been proposed as a mechanism to explain the early events in specification of cotyledon primordia . in support of this high levels of _PROTEIN_ from the auxin sensitive reporter are observed in the early cotyledon primordia in wild type embryos . bob mutant embryos that do not carry the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ transgene do not show significant levels of _METHOD_ indicating that the observed _METHOD_ is not due to alterations in bob mutant physiology . in _PROTEIN_ mutant embryos is _PROTEIN_ throughout the globular stage embryo suggesting that uniform and high auxin levels are found throughout the embryo . thus _PROTEIN_ mutants are defective in limiting auxin maxima in the apical domain of the embryo to the cotyledon primorida as well as to the root pole of the embryo and show overall higher levels of auxin throughout the globular embryo . auxin maxima in the embryo have been associated both with the developing cotyledon primordia as well as with the developing root pole of the embryo . to determine if gene _PROTEIN_ patterns are abnormal at the root end of the embryo we analyzed _PROTEIN_ of the scarecrow gene . scarecrow _PROTEIN_ is first seen at the globular stage where it is found in the lenticular cell . _PROTEIN_ expands to include the endodermis as the embryo progresses through the heart and torpedo stages . by contrast bob mutant embryos fail to _PROTEIN_ the scarecrow transgene . thus gene _PROTEIN_ associated with the auxin maximum at the root pole of the embryo is also disrupted in bob mutant embryos . preliminary mapping of the _PROTEIN_ locus placed it at the bottom of arabidopsis chromosome between cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence markers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . new caps markers were developed for fine mapping and the _PROTEIN_ region was narrowed to a kb region at cm on chromosome . two dna clones overlapped this region a tac clone and a clone . the kb _PROTEIN_ region contained predicted genes . predicted genes were amplified from wild type landsberg _LOCATION_ genomic dna and their sequences compared with published sequences from the same open reading frames in wild type columbia . polymorphic loci in the coding sequences of the two ecotypes were identified . predicted genes were then amplified out of genomic dna from an plant resulting from a cross between a _PROTEIN_ plant and a wild type col plant . because the _PROTEIN_ mutation is on a ler chromosome the plant contains one ler chromosome containing the mutation and one wild type col chromosome . amplification reaction products should be from the ler allele and from the col allele . amplification products were cloned into plasmid vectors and the inserts of several independent clones were sequenced and examined for the presence of a mutation . to ensure that both chromosomes present in the _PROTEIN_ plant had been examined for mutations the sequences were compared in amplification products containing _METHOD_ between ler and col sequences . sequencing of the locus from the ler chromosome of a _PROTEIN_ plant revealed that it contained a c to t transition that created a stop codon at amino acid position of the predicted protein . to ensure that this was the mutation causing the _PROTEIN_ phenotype a kb fragment of dna was amplified and put into binary vector pcambia for transformation into wild type arabidopsis . the rescue plasmid was named . after transformation wild type ler plants resistant to hygromycin were crossed to _PROTEIN_ plants . the hygromycin resistant progeny from this cross were allowed to self fertilize and the embryos inside self crossed siliques were examined for segregation of _PROTEIN_ embryos . _PROTEIN_ and wild type embryos in siliques from plants that segregated _PROTEIN_ embryos were counted . a total of of these embryos displayed the _PROTEIN_ phenotype which is in agreement with _PROTEIN_ embryos the expected ratio for self progeny segregating from a parent heterozygous for the _PROTEIN_ mutation and hemizygous for a rescuing plasmid . finally a second allele _PROTEIN_ containing a t dna insertion in the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ at ile was obtained from the salk t dna collection . self pollinated _PROTEIN_ siliques contain embryos arrested at the globular stage in a ratio . to show that these aborted embryos were due to a lesion in _PROTEIN_ crosses between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ heterozygous plants were performed . _PROTEIN_ failed to complement the _PROTEIN_ aborted embryo phenotype . these genetic and molecular complementation experiments demonstrate that the _PROTEIN_ embryo arrest phenotype is due to mutations in the gene . to demonstrate that the _PROTEIN_ mislocalization phenotype observed in _PROTEIN_ arrested embryos is due to the _PROTEIN_ lesion as opposed to a separate linked mutation we further characterized _PROTEIN_ . plants heterozygous for _PROTEIN_ were crossed to the _PROTEIN_ gus reporter . arrested embryos in the siliques of the self pollinated progeny of this cross displayed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which was similar to the mislocalization observed in _PROTEIN_ . since two independent _PROTEIN_ alleles both display _PROTEIN_ mislocalization we conclude that this phenotype is specifically due to lesions in _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ encodes a homolog of the a. nidulans nudc _LOCATION_ gene and nudc domain containing proteins are found in fungi animals and plants . there is one close _PROTEIN_ homolog in the arabidopsis genome that is contained in a _PROTEIN_ syntenous region . is very similar to _PROTEIN_ sharing identity over the whole protein and identity within the conserved c terminal domain . the stop codon in _PROTEIN_ is near the start of the conserved c terminal nudc domain of the _PROTEIN_ gene . the placement of the mutation and the severity of the _PROTEIN_ phenotype indicate that this conserved domain is important to the functioning of _PROTEIN_ although it is currently unknown what its biochemical function might be . sectioned siliques from a plant heterozygous for the _PROTEIN_ mutation were examined by in situ hybridization using an antisense probe made from _PROTEIN_ cdna . the results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ throughout the early embryo . _PROTEIN_ mrna first accumulates at a point before the eight cell stage of embryogenesis and _PROTEIN_ remains strong until the transition stage . in transition and heart stage embryos variable _PROTEIN_ could be detected and after heart stage no mrna could be detected . _PROTEIN_ mutant embryos did not detectably _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mrna . sectioned siliques from _PROTEIN_ plants examined with a control _PROTEIN_ sense probe did not show any hybridization . a _PROTEIN_ gus reporter transgene was constructed and named . _PROTEIN_ coding sequences with introns and kb of sequences were amplified creating an in frame fusion to gus . wild type ler plants were transformed with and hygromycin resistant transformants were allowed to self fertilize . gus _PROTEIN_ in transformed lines agrees with the in situ hybridization findings for _PROTEIN_ mrna _PROTEIN_ gus is _PROTEIN_ throughout the early embryo and clears away at a variable time after transition stage . the _PROTEIN_ gus reporter _METHOD_ to be detectable until _PROTEIN_ in embryogenesis than _PROTEIN_ mrna perhaps reflecting the _PROTEIN_ that the gus assay detects protein while the in situ hybridizations detect mrna . alternatively the gus reporter may be missing a negative controlling element . the same promoter fragment was used to drive _PROTEIN_ of a bob _METHOD_ fusion protein . a genomic fragment including the promoter plus bob exons and introns was fused to _METHOD_ . this construct was capable of rescuing bob null mutants . analysis of embryos _PROTEIN_ this construct shows that the bob protein accumulates throughout the cytoplasm . in heart stage embryos the protein may be somewhat enriched in epidermal cells . the location of the bob protein in the cytoplasm is consistent with a predicted role of nudc like proteins as chaperones .
