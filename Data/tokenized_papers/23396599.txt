the morphology of plant _LOCATION_ varies among different species organs tissues and cell types . however _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ involved in the _PROTEIN_ of _LOCATION_ morphology are poorly understood . because _LOCATION_ retain their shapes even after cytoskeletal inhibitor treatments both in vivo and in vitro we assumed involvement of the _LOCATION_ lamina which plays a critical role in the regulation of _LOCATION_ morphology in animals . the crude _LOCATION_ lamina fraction isolated from arabidopsis thaliana leaves was analyzed by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and putative _LOCATION_ lamina proteins were identified . among their t dna insertion lines _LOCATION_ of little _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ disruptants were more spherical than those of wild type plants . because a. thaliana harbors four linc genes we prepared all single and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ double disruptants . in leaf epidermal cells the circularity index of the _LOCATION_ in all linc disruptants except _PROTEIN_ was significantly higher than that in the wild type plants . the extent of the effects of _PROTEIN_ and/or _PROTEIN_ disruption was significantly higher than that of the effects of _PROTEIN_ disruption . the _LOCATION_ area was significantly smaller in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ disruptants than in the wild type plants . _PROTEIN_ of the defects in _LOCATION_ morphology all linc disruptants exhibited a normal ploidy level . in interphase cells _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ localized to the _LOCATION_ periphery whereas _PROTEIN_ was in the nucleoplasm and _PROTEIN_ was detected in both regions . from prometaphase to anaphase in mitotic root tip cells _PROTEIN_ was co localized with chromosomes whereas other lincs were dispersed in the cytoplasm .
to determine whether _LOCATION_ play any role in the _PROTEIN_ of plant _LOCATION_ morphology we semi quantitatively measured the circularity index and area of the _LOCATION_ in leaf epidermal cells of a. thaliana after treatment with latrunculin b and/or propyzamide . no statistically significant difference was detected in either parameter from the control _LOCATION_ in any treatment . furthermore _LOCATION_ isolated from a. thaliana leaves retained their spindle shape even after treatment with triton x the shape was the same as that in the leaves . the morphology of demembranated _LOCATION_ was also _PROTEIN_ after treatment with latrunculin b and/or propyzamide . consequently we assumed that _LOCATION_ morphology is _PROTEIN_ by intranuclear _PROTEIN_ such as _LOCATION_ lamina components but not by _LOCATION_ . mesh like structures composed of fibrous materials typical of the _LOCATION_ lamina were clearly present in electron micrographs of the crude _LOCATION_ lamina fraction prepared from a. thaliana leaf protoplasts . a total of proteins were identified as putative _LOCATION_ lamina proteins by lc _METHOD_ of the fraction . because animal lamins are equipped with dna binding activity we selected of the proteins harboring putative dna binding motifs or with unknown functions . two lines exhibiting spherical _LOCATION_ shapes in leaf trichome cells were screened from t dna insertion lines for these genes . one line was a _PROTEIN_ disruptant and the other was a _PROTEIN_ disruptant . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ single disruptants and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ double disruptants were prepared to determine which linc family _METHOD_ were involved in the _PROTEIN_ of _LOCATION_ morphology . disruption of these distinctive genes was confirmed by reverse transcription pcr using gene specific primers . no detectable difference in the whole plant morphology was obvious between any of the linc disruptants and wild type plants at least under the present growth conditions . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ patterns in the wild type plants were also confirmed by rt pcr . all linc genes appeared to be _PROTEIN_ in the whole plant body . we semi quantitatively measured the circularity index and area of the _LOCATION_ in the leaf and root epidermal cells of linc disruptants . in leaf epidermal cells the circularity index of the _LOCATION_ in all linc disruptants except _PROTEIN_ was significantly higher than that in the wild type plants . the extent of the effects of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ disruption was significantly higher than that of the effects of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ disruption . the _LOCATION_ area in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ disruptants was significantly smaller than that in the wild type plants while the _LOCATION_ area in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ disruptants was not significantly different from that in the wild type plants . neither the _LOCATION_ circularity index nor the _LOCATION_ area in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ disruptants was significantly different from each other suggesting that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ indispensable for _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ morphology in leaf epidermal cells . more or less similar results were obtained in root epidermal cells except that _PROTEIN_ disruption resulted in a small but significant effect on the _LOCATION_ circularity index . in summary although all linc genes were _PROTEIN_ in the whole plant body _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ functioned predominantly and _PROTEIN_ subordinately in the _PROTEIN_ of _LOCATION_ morphology in leaf and root epidermal cells . _PROTEIN_ functioned in roots but did not function or redundantly functioned with other lincs in leaves . we confirmed that the abnormal _LOCATION_ morphology of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ disruptants was recovered by introducing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ respectively into the disruptants . because _LOCATION_ morphology in leaf epidermal cells was altered in most of the linc disruptants we analyzed the dna content in _LOCATION_ isolated from rosette leaves by flow cytometry . as reported previously _LOCATION_ from the wild type leaves had widely distributed dna content ranging from to with the highest population of _LOCATION_ containing in week old plants . _LOCATION_ of all linc disruptants exhibited almost identical patterns of dna content compared with the _LOCATION_ of the wild type plants . thus lincs may not be involved in the determination of the ploidy level at least in leaf cells . we investigated the effects of linc disruption on light dependent _LOCATION_ positioning to determine whether _LOCATION_ morphology affects _LOCATION_ movement . _LOCATION_ of the leaf cells of a. thaliana relocate from the center of the bottom of cells to the anticlinal walls in response to strong blue light . only of _LOCATION_ of the leaf epidermal cells of the wild type plants were located along the anticlinal walls under dark conditions whereas _LOCATION_ were along the anticlinal walls after blue light illumination at for h . all linc disruptants exhibited almost normal light dependent _LOCATION_ positioning indicating that lincs are not involved in the regulation of _LOCATION_ movement and that _LOCATION_ morphology may not affect _LOCATION_ movement in leaf epidermal cells . we investigated the intracellular localization of linc _METHOD_ or linc yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter in the wild type plants . as reported previously _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ localized to the _LOCATION_ periphery and _PROTEIN_ was localized in the nucleoplasm of both leaf and root epidermal cells . _PROTEIN_ was also localized in the nucleoplasm of both epidermal cell types . punctate or bundle like _PROTEIN_ structures were detected occasionally . _PROTEIN_ clearly exhibited a bundle shape localization pattern along the long axis of the _LOCATION_ in trichrome cells . _PROTEIN_ was localized frequently to the _LOCATION_ periphery as punctate structures of different sizes in both epidermal cell types . furthermore the _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overexpressing plants was considerably larger than that in the wild type plants . the longer axis of leaf epidermal _LOCATION_ of the wild type plants was approximately at the longest but that in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overexpressing plants reached up to . we also investigated the intracellular localization of lincs in the fixed root apical meristem . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in interphase cells were _PROTEIN_ localized to the _LOCATION_ periphery whereas _PROTEIN_ was in the nucleoplasm . a part of _PROTEIN_ was localized in the nucleoplasm and a part of _PROTEIN_ appeared to form punctate structures at the _LOCATION_ periphery . _PROTEIN_ seemed to be localized on the condensing chromatin during prometaphase to anaphase whereas other lincs were localized diffusely in the cytoplasm . _PROTEIN_ appeared to be transferred from the decondensing chromatin to the reassembling _LOCATION_ envelope during early telophase . a small population of _PROTEIN_ was transferred from the cytoplasm to the chromatin surface . _PROTEIN_ was also transferred from the cytoplasm to the chromatin surface as if preferentially assembling to the distal surface of the chromatin . _PROTEIN_ was assembled into punctate structures in the cytoplasm and then to the chromatin surface . all lincs were again localized to the _LOCATION_ periphery during _PROTEIN_ telophase and a part of _PROTEIN_ was still localized on the punctate structures . these results suggest that individual lincs exhibit different redistribution patterns during different mitotic phases .
