a conserved role is established for _PROTEIN_ protein in prokaryote type rrna accumulation which is required for plant embryogenesis but non essential for the survival of bacteria .
_PROTEIN_ proteins are found in nearly all sequenced bacteria and most plant genomes but are not present in genomes of archaea fungi or animals . while _PROTEIN_ proteins were found to be broadly conserved in plants including diverse red algae and green algae genomes as well as all sequenced land plant genomes exhaustive searches failed to detect _PROTEIN_ sequences in genomes of chlorella and chlamydomonas that represent the chlorophyceae group of green algae . to gain understanding of the evolution of _PROTEIN_ genes a phylogenic analysis of _PROTEIN_ proteins from representative bacterial algae and plant genomes was performed . the resulting tree revealed that all completely sequenced land plant genomes contain members of two distinct subfamilies _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ whereas genomes of red and green algae typically contain single _PROTEIN_ proteins that have varying affinities for the a and b groups and bacterial _PROTEIN_ proteins . while this relationship is consistent with the hypothesis that the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ clades arose via duplication of an ancestral algal _PROTEIN_ gene because some algal sequences grouped with bacterial _PROTEIN_ proteins the alternative possibility that either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ was acquired separately from bacteria by horizontal gene transfer could not be ruled out . in either case the separation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins most probably pre dated the evolution of land plants . although _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes are unlinked in most plant genomes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes are adjacent in the arabidopsis genome . unrooted tree of land plant _PROTEIN_ protein sequences . protein sequences were aligned by muscle and used to construct a maximum likelihood tree based on the jtt _PROTEIN_ based model by . bootstrap support was based on iterations . more detailed sequence analysis of plant _PROTEIN_ containing proteins revealed conserved features of the _PROTEIN_ domain . the conserved amino acid residues in plant _PROTEIN_ domain sequences fell primarily into two clusters located in the n terminal and middle regions of _PROTEIN_ respectively . a pair of cysteine motifs c x c and c x c located in cluster and cluster respectively form a potential metal binding structure . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ type proteins are distinguished by a amino acid insertion in _PROTEIN_ . the maize _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ encodes a amino acid protein containing a _PROTEIN_ between residues and . recessive mutations in _PROTEIN_ were identified in a screen of embryo specific lethal seed mutants isolated from the uniformmu transposon population . ears of self pollinated heterozygotes segregated wild type emb seed in the expected mendelian ratio for a recessive mutant . mu transposon insertions linked to the emb phenotype were identified using mu seq genotyping technology . the _PROTEIN_ allele contains a mu insertion in the second exon of _PROTEIN_ while _PROTEIN_ has a mu insertion in the first exon . the allelic relationship between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was tested using reciprocal crosses of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants . segregation of the emb phenotype in of

one intron . the and untranslated regions are shown by gray rectangles . the gray triangles indicate the locations of mu insertions . a self pollinated ear segregating _PROTEIN_ mutant kernels . scale

pcr . relative _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene in _METHOD_ and embryos sampled at various developmental stages and in roots shoots and second leaves from week old seedlings . for developing seed samples _LOCATION_ bars indicate the _PROTEIN_ of three technical replicates . for seedling samples _LOCATION_ bars indicate the _PROTEIN_ of three biological replicates . to characterize _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ during normal development mrna was quantified by qrt pcr in diverse maize tissues including hand dissected embryos and _METHOD_ harvested at different developmental stages as well as root young leaf and shoot tissues sampled from week old seedlings . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was detected in all tissues tested though transcript levels varied . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was markedly higher in photosynthetic shoot and leaf tissues in comparison with root embryo and endosperm . the lack of a pronounced _PROTEIN_ difference in embryo and endosperm indicated that the embryo specific phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutant was not due to embryo specific _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . the qrt pcr results were consistent with transcriptome data obtained from qteller showing universal _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and high _PROTEIN_ in green tissues . at maturity _PROTEIN_ mutant seed contains only a small remnant of dark brown necrotic tissue at the position of the embryo whereas the mutant endosperm _METHOD_ a cavity on the germinal face in the space where the embryo would normally develop . except for the presence of an empty embryo cleft the endosperm of the _PROTEIN_ kernel was fully developed and morphologically normal with slightly more intense anthocyanin pigmentation than the wild type while the endosperm dry weight of _PROTEIN_ mutant kernels was lower compared with the wild type . in these respects _PROTEIN_ has a typical maize emb phenotype as described in previous studies . longitudinal sections of mature mutant kernels indicated that embryo development was uniformly arrested during early embryogenesis . to resolve the developmental stage at which embryogenesis is blocked developing kernels from segregating ears of self pollinated heterozygous plants were harvested at and dap embedded in paraffin and sectioned for examination by light microscopy . in wild type kernels a proembryo with radially symmetric embryo proper and basal suspensor typical of an early transition stage was visible at dap . at dap scutellum coleoptile and shoot and root meristem structures were well developed in wild type embryos . by dap the shoot apical meristem had formed primary leaves . at dap primary leaves formed in the embryo covering the sam and hypocotyl radicle and coleorhiza were well developed at this stage . the _PROTEIN_ mutant embryos were indistinguishable from the wild type at dap whereas mutant embryos were clearly identifiable at dap indicating that development was arrested at some point between and dap . at dap mutant embryos resembled normal albeit slightly enlarged early transition stage embryos with no evidence of apical meristem formation . by dap the morphology of mutant embryos was basically unchanged except for increased size relative to dap embryos . at dap the embryo proper of transition stage like mutant embryos was further enlarged without an obvious increase in the size of the suspensor . these results indicated that _PROTEIN_ mutant embryos do not progress beyond the early transition stage of embryogenesis . in this respect the _PROTEIN_ phenotype is similar to an emerging class of maize emb mutants implicated in disruption of _LOCATION_ gene _PROTEIN_ . in maize the emb phenotypes of _LOCATION_ gene _PROTEIN_ mutants are suppressed in certain inbred backgrounds to condition an albino seedling phenotype . embryo phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant embryos at and dap were longitudinally sectioned for light microscopy . embryos at the transition stage are indicated by white arrows . scale bars . to test whether the _PROTEIN_ emb phenotype was suppressible heterozygous _PROTEIN_ plants were crossed to the _PROTEIN_ inbred a permissive genetic background for embryogenesis of mutants with defects in _LOCATION_ gene _PROTEIN_ . among progeny of the _PROTEIN_ hybrid segregation of normal to emb seed was significantly skewed from the mendelian ratio obtained in the background with an excess of normal seeds consistent with suppression of embryo lethality . the morphologically normal seeds were then germinated to evaluate seedling phenotypes . albino seedlings were produced by of the morphologically normal seeds and of total seeds whereas no albino seedling was detected among progeny of self pollinated _PROTEIN_ control plants . pcr genotyping showed that all of the albino seedlings were homozygous for _PROTEIN_ confirming that the albino seedlings resulted from suppression of the _PROTEIN_ emb phenotype . in addition a few seeds germinated to produce seedlings with abnormal shoot development . genotyping confirmed that the abnormal seedlings were also homozygous _PROTEIN_ . the emb albino and shootless seedling classes combined accounted for of the progeny that were expected to be homozygous mutant . segregation of emb and albino seedling phenotypes of progeny in hybrid background p < . segregation of _PROTEIN_ seedling phenotypes in hybrid progeny .

the number of individuals identified with each genotype . qrt pcr showing absence of _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ in albino seedling leaves . total rna samples extracted from wild type and albino leaves from week old seedlings were analyzed . _LOCATION_ bars indicate the _PROTEIN_ of three biological replicates . to test whether maternal effects contribute to the genetic background suppression of the emb phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutant crosses between heterozygous _PROTEIN_ as female and _PROTEIN_ inbred as male were made . the emb phenotype of populations was also suppressed to the albino seedling phenotype with a segregation ratio of albino seedlings at the total seed base . the results indicated that maternal effects had little or no influence on suppression of the emb phenotype . consistent with the genotyping results qrt pcr analyses failed to detect _PROTEIN_ transcripts in leaves of albino seedlings indicating that the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ alleles are null mutations . a comparative genomic analysis utilizing the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ databases was used to explore possible functions of _PROTEIN_ proteins . in the e. coli genome the _PROTEIN_ homolog yced is located directly upstream of and co transcribed with the rpmf gene that encodes ribosomal large subunit protein . this association is remarkably conserved in diverse bacterial clades including proteobacteria deferribacteraceae aquificales thermotogaceae actinobacteria thermodesulfobacteriaceae fibrobacteres acidobacteria group firmicutes synergistaceae chloroflexi and dictyoglomus . in clostridium thermosaccharolyticum _PROTEIN_ is fused with ribosomal protein reinforcing a close functional relationship . an association of bacteria _PROTEIN_ homologs with rnase iii genes involved in rrna processing is also detected in actinobacteria firmicutes synergistaceae and dictyoglomus . in addition to being linked to genes involved in bacterial ribosome formation _PROTEIN_ clusters with genes involved in phospholipid synthesis and fatty acid elongation . association between bacterial _PROTEIN_ and prokaryotic ribosomes . bacterial _PROTEIN_ genes function in a conserved operon . an association with ribosomal protein and fatty acid biosynthetic genes is conserved in diverse groups of bacteria . plsx fatty acid phospholipid synthesis protein fabh oxoacyl synthase iii fabd malonyl

represent either genes less conserved in a gene cluster or genes encoding uncharacterized proteins . data are from the _PROTEIN_ database . growth of the mutant is comparable with that of the at and . relative accumulation of bacterial ribosome and rrnas and the relative _PROTEIN_ of the rpmf gene in the wild type and mutant . p < . _LOCATION_ bars indicate the _PROTEIN_ of three biological replicates . however in spite of being among the most broadly conserved bacterial genes known there is no direct evidence that _PROTEIN_ genes are essential in bacteria . high throughput analyses of e. coli gene knockouts grown on diverse media did not establish a well defined phenotype for the _PROTEIN_ homolog yced . consistent with that study we found that on rich media growth of the e. coli _PROTEIN_ knockout strain was similar to that of at and . however qrt pcr quantification of the rpmf transcript and and rrnas in cultures showed that rrna content was _PROTEIN_ in compared with the wild type whereas the effects on and rrnas and rpmf rna levels were not statistically significant . our qrt pcr results are consistent with a specific role for _PROTEIN_ in synthesis processing and/or stability of rrna in bacteria . to address a possible role for maize _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ ribosome formation rrna components of _LOCATION_ ribosomes were quantified in mutant and wild type tissues by qrt pcr a general method to detect the _LOCATION_ rrnas . total rna was extracted from both mutant and wild type tissues including dap _METHOD_ of inbred and dap embryo and leaf and root tissues of week old seedlings of the _PROTEIN_ hybrid . the latter included viable embryos and albino seedlings that were homozygous _PROTEIN_ . the qrt pcr results showed that rrna contents of endosperm embryo leaf and root tissues were significantly _PROTEIN_ in the mutant compared with the wild type . in contrast levels of and rrnas were less affected showing significant reduction only in mutant embryos and albino leaves of _PROTEIN_ seedlings . the significant _PROTEIN_ of _LOCATION_ rrna in all tissues tested indicated that _PROTEIN_ is specifically required for normal accumulation of rrna . overall the fold reduction of rrna content in the mutant was in proportion to the total amount of _LOCATION_ rrna found in normal tissues . qrt pcr analysis showed that the level of _LOCATION_ rrna in leaves was times the amount found in embryos and fold and fold greater than in roots and endosperm respectively . _LOCATION_ rrna contents and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ gene transcript levels in _PROTEIN_ tissues . relative accumulation of _LOCATION_ and rrnas and relative _PROTEIN_ of _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ in wild type and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ embryos and leaves and roots of week old seedlings . relative _LOCATION_ rrna contents of dap _METHOD_ dap embryos and leaves and roots from week old seedlings . p < p < . _LOCATION_ bars indicate the _PROTEIN_ of three biological replicates . to examine further a potential functional association between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ transcript abundance of _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ was analyzed in mutant and wild type endosperm embryo and leaf and root tissues by qrt pcr . compared with the wild type the level of _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ transcript was reduced by > fold in mutant embryos whereas relative _PROTEIN_ in mutant _METHOD_ was slightly greater than in the wild type . in contrast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in roots and albino seedling leaves was not significantly affected by the _PROTEIN_ mutant . in order to determine whether the function of _PROTEIN_ is conserved in plants a t dna insertion line that has an insertion located in the second exon of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ gene was characterized . segregation of the insertion allele was analyzed by pcr genotyping progeny of self pollinated _PROTEIN_ plants . a set of progeny included heterozygous individuals and homozygous wild type seedlings . the failure to detect plants homozygous for the t dna insertion suggested that the _PROTEIN_ mutant had a seed lethal phenotype . consistent with that hypothesis segregation of white emb seeds was observed in immature siliques of self pollinated heterozygotes . at maturity the defective seeds appeared dark brown and shrunken . transmission bias was tested by making reciprocal crosses of heterozygous _PROTEIN_ and wild type col plants . pcr genotyping results showed that in both directions out of progeny of _PROTEIN_ /col and out of col _PROTEIN_ carry the t dna insertion which fit the expected heterozygote wild type ratio for unbiased transmission through male and female gametophytes with p and respectively . _PROTEIN_ mutant . exon structure of _PROTEIN_ and t dna insertion site . the and untranslated regions are shown by gray rectangles . green siliques of wild type and a self pollinated _PROTEIN_ plant segregating white seeds and a homozygous _PROTEIN_ plant carrying the plus _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene . mature silique of a self pollinated _PROTEIN_ plant segregating brown shriveled seeds . to confirm that the t dna insertion in _PROTEIN_ is the cause of the emb phenotype transgenic experiments were performed to determine whether a wild type _PROTEIN_ sequence was able to complement the emb phenotype . col genomic dna fragments of and containing the _PROTEIN_ coding region plus and of upstream sequence respectively were cloned into the vector to create a c terminal _METHOD_ fusion protein . the constructs were introduced into plants heterozygous for the _PROTEIN_ mutant by floral dip and transformed seedlings were selected based on resistance to hygromycin . presence of the transgene was confirmed by pcr genotyping and by rt pcr . transformed seedlings were allowed to self pollinate and the progeny were genotyped for the presence of the _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion . if complementation occurred we expected to recover homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings among the progeny . complementation was confirmed for both constructs with at least two independent transgenic lines . a homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant carrying the plus transgene is shown in . overall of plants were homozygous mutant consistent with the expected frequency of . the expected frequency is based on the assumption that if complementation occurs of seeds will not germinate to form seedlings . seed and seedling phenotypes of the complemented homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant were indistinguishable from those of the wild type . these results confirmed that the _PROTEIN_ gene is responsible for the emb phenotype . both maize and arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ proteins are predicted to be targeted to either the chloroplast or mitochondria according to targetp . _PROTEIN_ was previously detected in the stroma proteomes of maize bundle sheath and mesophyll chloroplasts . although _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of the native promoter was able to complement the _PROTEIN_ phenotype fully we were unable consistently to detect or localize _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in transgenic seedlings . interestingly _PROTEIN_ has thus far been detected in chloroplast stroma proteomes of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants that are deficient in _LOCATION_ clppr protease though not in the wild type suggesting that _PROTEIN_ accumulation may be limited by protein turnover . as an alternative approach subcellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was analyzed by transient overexpression in n. benthaminana leaves via agrobacterium infiltration . to enhance image resolution mesophyll protoplasts were isolated from n. benthaminana leaves after infiltration . in agreement with the predicted localization confocal microscope imaging showed that _METHOD_ _METHOD_ from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ co localized with chlorophyll _METHOD_ in the n. benthaminana mesophyll protoplasts . there is some evidence that ribosome assembly is associated with _LOCATION_ nucleoids . a set of protoplasts that showed co localization of _METHOD_ signal with the chlorophyll _METHOD_ included protoplasts in which _METHOD_ _METHOD_ had a punctate distribution within the chloroplast a pattern that resembles the positioning of nucleoids before and after chloroplast division . about one third of the protoplasts showed a filamentous distribution of _METHOD_ signal at the chloroplast periphery a pattern consistent with the distributions of nucleoids during early stages of chloroplast division . the remaining protoplasts exhibited an intermediate pattern . however analyses of maize nucleoid proteomes did not detect enrichment of _PROTEIN_ in the nucleoid fraction . subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ . confocal _METHOD_ detection of _METHOD_ in mesophyll protoplasts isolated from n. benthamiana leaf cells transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ including punctate intermediate and filamentous patterns of _METHOD_ plus a non transformed control . numbers indicate protoplasts observed in each class . scale bars .
the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ alleles were isolated from the uniformmu transposon population . maize plants were grown at the university of florida plant science research and education unit in citra fl during the spring and autumn seasons or sown in a winter greenhouse with supplemental light . seeds of the _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion line obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center were stratified at in the dark for d sterilized and plated on media containing murashige and skoog salts mes sucrose and phytagel . seedlings were incubated in continuous light for d at then transferred to soil and grown in a growth chamber under continuous light at for weeks . developing wild type and _PROTEIN_ kernels were harvested at and days after pollination from ears of self pollinated heterozygous plants . fixation embedding and sectioning were performed as described by . sections made with a leitz microtome were stained with johansen s safranin o and fast green and imaged with a leica _PROTEIN_ microscope . heterozygous _PROTEIN_ plants were reciprocally crossed with _PROTEIN_ inbred and heterozygous plants were self pollinated to generate populations . seeds from segregating

miniprep with in column dnase i treatment according to the manufacturer s instructions . first strand cdna was synthesized by superscript iii reverse transcriptase using random hexamers for _LOCATION_ rrna measurements and oligo for mrna analyses . for qrt pcr a premix ex taq ii kit was used with the applied _METHOD_ fast real time pcr system . in maize the forward and reverse primer pair used for _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ was tcctcaaggtatatttgccaatttct/cagtcgatatcttgatctccatccat and for the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ gene it was aaaaacgtacttcgatgtcaaaaa/agaaaatgatcttgattttgctaaaga . for _LOCATION_ and rrna levels the forward and reverse primer pairs were taccgtactccagcttggtagtttc/gtaaga cagaggatgcaagcgttat _PROTEIN_ gacaacaggtcaata _PROTEIN_ cgca and caaatcgttcgttcg ttagg/ggtgtcaagtggaagtgcag respectively . in e. coli the forward and reverse primer pair used for the rpmf gene was _PROTEIN_ tcaccagaagttttgtc . for e. coli and rrna levels the forward and reverse primer pairs were ttaatacctttgctcattgacgttac/ggatttcacatc tgacttaacaaacc ctaaggtcccaaagtcatgg ttaagt/gaccagtgagctattacgctttcttt and cggtggtcccacctgacc/gcctggcagttcccta ctct respectively . an absolute quantitative method was used for rna analysis using an equal amount of total rna per sample . standard curves were generated from an independent cdna sample subjected to the same rna extraction and reverse transcription steps . an arbitrary copy number was assigned to the starting material of the dilution series and the copy number of each point was calculated accordingly . to construct a standard curve the log base of the arbitrary copy number was taken for each dilution point and the ct values of dilution points measured by qrt pcr were fitted by linear regression . then the ct values of samples were converted to the relative _PROTEIN_ value based on the standard curve . for transgenic complementation of arabidopsis columbia genomic fragments of and containing the _PROTEIN_ coding region as well as or of upstream sequences respectively were pcr amplified by max dna polymerase using primer pairs caccgttgttgttgtttgcttcttgt/gttccttagtccctctttttgttgc and caccaagaagaaagggaacaaaatca/gttccttagtccctctttttgttgc respectively . pcr products were cloned into the binary gateway vector . agrobacterium tumefaciens strain was used to transform _PROTEIN_ plants by floral dip . transformants were selected on murashige and skoog plates containing hygromycin and _PROTEIN_ . antibiotic resistant seedlings were transferred to soil and grown in a growth chamber . and seedlings were genotyped by pcr using forward and reverse primers _PROTEIN_ for the wild type allele _PROTEIN_ for the t dna insertion allele and _PROTEIN_ for detection of transgenes . transgene _PROTEIN_ was confirmed in independent lines by rt pcr using primer pair caccatgtctctggtttgctctttatc/cttgtacag ctcgtccatgc . to construct _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ for transient _PROTEIN_ a cdna containing the _PROTEIN_ coding region was amplified from leaf total rna by pcr with primers caccatgtctctggtttgctctttatc/gttccttagtccctctttttgttgc and cloned in a binary gateway vector . for subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ an overnight culture of a. tumefaciens cells transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was pelleted by centrifugation and suspended in inducing buffer to an of . cells were injected into tobacco leaf epidermis with a syringe . mesophyll protoplasts were isolated from infiltrated leaves after injection as described in et al . . protoplasts were collected by centrifugation in a round bottom tube at g for re suspended in solution . protoplasts were imaged with an olympus confocal _METHOD_ microscope .
