defective in meristem silencing _METHOD_ mutants are sensitive to kanamycin because this mutation reduces _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . we isolated a kanamycin resistant mutant from an ethyl methanesulfonate _METHOD_ mutagenized _METHOD_ population containing approximately individuals . genetic analysis indicated that mutation is recessive . using map based cloning the mutation was narrowed to the area between the and bacterial artificial chromosomes on chromosome . we identified a g to a point mutation that led to abnormal splicing and the formation of a stop codon in the putative . an _PROTEIN_ downstream of the stop codon may serve as a potential start codon for the mutant . the mutation results in a amino acid deletion at the n terminus of the protein . the putative arabidopsis is present in one copy and is essential because we could not obtain a homozygote from the progeny of a heterozygous t dna insertion mutant . when we crossed with the heterozygote approximately half of the progeny exhibited severe growth retardation . these results demonstrate that and are allelic that the severe growth phenotype of might be due to the lower level of protein generated by a single copy of and that is critical for plant development . _PROTEIN_ staining in gus transgenic lines indicated that is ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ but more abundant in the root and shoot _METHOD_ where dna replication is more active compared with the other tissues . the transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ protein in tobacco cells indicated that _METHOD_ is localized to the _LOCATION_ and enriched in the nucleoli . the mutation partially restored nptii _PROTEIN_ and kanamycin resistance compared with twt . when we transferred wild type genomic dna to the _METHOD_ double mutant and randomly selected three independent transgene lines these transgenic lines recovered the low _PROTEIN_ level of nptii and the kanamycin sensitive phenotype that was present in _METHOD_ . these results confirm that the mutation causes the release of tgs in the _METHOD_ mutant . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was greatly _PROTEIN_ by _METHOD_ mutation which is correlated with the reduced _PROTEIN_ of nptii . the abundance of _PROTEIN_ in the single mutant was comparable to twt but the _PROTEIN_ of nptii was lower in the mutant than twt . also had no effect on the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the _METHOD_ background suggesting that de repression of nptii caused by mutation in the _METHOD_ background is not dependent on _PROTEIN_ . to confirm the involvement of in the _PROTEIN_ of tgs we crossed with the _PROTEIN_ mutant . _PROTEIN_ encodes a dna demethylase and its mutation causes silencing of nptii . we analyzed the phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ double mutant . in contrast to the kanamycin sensitive phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ partially restored kanamycin resistance . however did not affect _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ luc in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . these results indicate that is a suppressor of _PROTEIN_ on the nptii locus similar to other dna replication _PROTEIN_ . previous results from yeast and animal cell lines suggested that is an important _PROTEIN_ in the dna damage response . the mutant was hypersensitive to _METHOD_ . the mutant is much smaller compared than twt when exposed to p.p.m . _METHOD_ . furthermore the mutant could not survive or develop in the presence of more than p.p.m . _METHOD_ . however no significant growth differences were observed between the mutant and twt exposed to hydroxyurea or cisplatin . as a positive control we demonstrated that the fasciata _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant was sensitive to _METHOD_ cisplatin and hu . these results indicate that the mutant is specifically sensitive to _METHOD_ . we performed rna sequencing of twt and the mutant with two biological replicates for each sample . the _PROTEIN_ levels of genes involved in the dna repair pathway were significantly upregulated in the mutant including ras associated with diabetes protein _PROTEIN_ breast cancer susceptibility _PROTEIN_ and poly polymerase _PROTEIN_ . the increased level of dna damage associated genes and the sensitivity to _METHOD_ indicated that the mutant suffered from a constitutive dna stress response . telomere length disorder is another feature of genomic instability . next we investigated whether telomere length was altered due to the mutation . using a telomere specific probe we found that the telomere lengths of _METHOD_ and were shorter than in twt and the _METHOD_ mutant . these results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ the telomere length in arabidopsis and support a crucial role for in genomic stability by _PROTEIN_ telomere lengths and repairing dna damage . to elucidate the mechanism by which the mutants de repressed the silencing locus we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing _PROTEIN_ assays using and antibodies to study changes in the epigenetic profile between twt and mutant lines . the results obtained in this study correlated well with previous reports . we identified genes occupied by which covered of the genes modified by from a previous study and of the genes reported from a second study . we identified genes that harbored which represented a overlap with the genes obtained in a previous study . we identified genes that contained which covered of the genes reported in luo et al . . these results demonstrate that our _PROTEIN_ seq data are reliable . we analyzed histone modifications on the t dna locus between twt and the mutant using the _PROTEIN_ seq data . we observed a _PROTEIN_ in and as well as an increase in on the nptii gene body in the mutant compared with twt . then we performed a _PROTEIN_ qpcr assay to confirm the changes in histone modification among twt _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ samples . indeed we identified a significant _PROTEIN_ in the modification on the nptii gene body in and _METHOD_ compared with twt and the _METHOD_ mutant which was consistent with the _PROTEIN_ seq data . two independent complementary lines showed a recovered level similar to _METHOD_ indicating that the _PROTEIN_ of on the nptii gene body is caused by the mutation . additionally we identified an increase in on the nptii gene body in _METHOD_ compared with twt which was consistent with the reduced _PROTEIN_ of nptii in the _METHOD_ mutant . however the occupancy of on nptii in and _METHOD_ was similar to the _METHOD_ mutant which exhibited an increased level relative to twt . we also observed a reduced level of in the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ mutants compared with twt which correlated with the reduced _PROTEIN_ of nptii in these samples compared with twt . the luc region was also checked by _PROTEIN_ qpcr . the levels of and total were comparable among these samples while the level was slightly _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ and mutants relative to the other samples . as a control we demonstrated that the histone modification levels of the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme gene were comparable among twt _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and samples . we next examined dna methylation level of some regions of the transgene . consistent with previous results the region harbored high levels of dna methylation that were not changed by mutation . and the _METHOD_ double mutant showed slightly increased dna methylation in the nos region compared with twt and the _METHOD_ mutant . these results suggest that the release of nptii silencing in _METHOD_ by is not related to a change in dna methylation . together these results suggest that de repression of nptii in the _METHOD_ background caused by the mutation is most likely due to a _PROTEIN_ in on the nptii gene body . using _PROTEIN_ seq data we found genes with _PROTEIN_ and genes with increased levels in the mutant compared with twt _PROTEIN_ . to determine whether the altered histone modifications correlated with gene _PROTEIN_ we performed rna seq analysis . the _PROTEIN_ levels of the genes exhibiting reduced levels of in the mutant were significantly increased compared with twt . in contrast the _PROTEIN_ levels of genes with increased levels in the mutant were not significantly altered compared with twt . although a good correlation was noted between high gene _PROTEIN_ and high histone modification or low gene _PROTEIN_ and low modification in our rna seq and _PROTEIN_ data the mutant had a slight effect on . only or genes harbored increased or reduced levels respectively in the mutant relative to twt _PROTEIN_ . these results suggest that primarily affects and the _PROTEIN_ of these related genes . next we chose three marked genes for validation by _PROTEIN_ qpcr . for the was increased and was _PROTEIN_ in the _METHOD_ mutant with a _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ level while in or _METHOD_ mutation _PROTEIN_ and increased gene _PROTEIN_ compared with twt or _METHOD_ respectively . two complementary lines restored the levels of and gene _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ to that of _METHOD_ . for and _GENE_ mutation resulted in lower and higher than in twt or the _METHOD_ mutant . the _PROTEIN_ levels of and _GENE_ were higher in and _METHOD_ than twt or the _METHOD_ mutant . again the two complementary lines restored the level and repressed gene _PROTEIN_ . collectively these results point out the requirement for in silencing marked genes .
