we describe a streamlined and systematic method for cloning green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ open reading frame fusions and assessing their subcellular localization in arabidopsis thaliana cells . the sequencing of the arabidopsis genome has made it feasible to undertake genome based approaches to determine the function of each protein and define its subcellular localization . this is an essential step towards full functional analysis . the approach described here allows the economical handling of hundreds of _PROTEIN_ plant proteins in a timely fashion . we have integrated recombinational cloning of full length trimmed orf clones _PROTEIN_ with high efficiency transient transformation of arabidopsis cell cultures by a hypervirulent strain of agrobacterium . to demonstrate its utility we have used a selection of trimmed orfs representing a variety of key cellular processes and have defined the localization patterns of fusion proteins . these patterns have been classified into five _PROTEIN_ categories including cytoplasmic _LOCATION_ nucleolar organellar and endomembrane compartments . several genes annotated in genbank as unknown have been ascribed a protein localization pattern . we also demonstrate the application of flow cytometry to estimate the transformation efficiency and cell cycle phase of the _METHOD_ positive cells . this approach can be extended to functional studies including the precise cellular localization and the prediction of the role of unknown proteins the confirmation of bioinformatic predictions and proteomic experiments such as the determination of protein interactions in vivo and therefore has numerous applications in the post genomic analysis of protein function .
