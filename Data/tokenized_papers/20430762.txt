nitrate is frequently the major nitrogen source for plants and is generally assimilated during the day . in the absence of light nitrate can transiently accumulate in the _LOCATION_ lumen via tonoplast transporters . clc a a member of the clc family of anion transporters is critically involved in this nitrate storage in the _LOCATION_ while other clc family members apparently have different roles in diverse cell organelles . here clc b a close relative of clc a was functionally _PROTEIN_ in oocytes and analyzed . clc b conducted strongly outwardly rectifying anionic currents that were largest in the presence of nitrate . _METHOD_ ratio changes of oocytes loaded with a ph dependent _METHOD_ dye suggested that transport is associated with h exchange . clc b was localized at the tonoplast as was clc c when tagged with the green _METHOD_ protein . clc b _PROTEIN_ was strongest in young roots hypocotyl and cotyledons . the physiological role of clc b was analyzed using two independent knock out alleles . both lines grew as the wild type in various conditions . the total chloride and nitrate content was identical in clcb lines and the wild type potentially suggesting that mutants were able to compensate the loss of clc b .
clc b was _PROTEIN_ in oocytes for functional characterization . since _PROTEIN_ in oocytes had been initially unsuccessful a green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged version was used to monitor the _PROTEIN_ level in oocytes . confocal _METHOD_ analysis suggested that clc b was _PROTEIN_ at the rim of the oocyte . clc b _PROTEIN_ oocytes were then exposed to solutions that contained different chloride and nitrate concentrations . a voltage protocol ranging from to mv was used to study these oocytes with two electrode voltage clamp . as with clc a nitrate elicited outward currents in clc b _PROTEIN_ oocytes but not in the water injected control oocytes . the currents were strongly outwardly rectifying . this rectification was similar to that in rat clc while clc a showed less rectification . the currents at the most positive potential increased within _METHOD_ to a steady state value indicating that the transport was gated . these features were similar to a _LOCATION_ current that corresponds to clc a in patch clamp analysis but were distinct from heterologously _PROTEIN_ clc a in oocytes . the current was reduced in the presence of halides which was similar to the clc a currents in patch clamp analysis but was distinct from clc a currents in oocytes . a conductivity sequence of > > > _GENE_ was measured at positive _LOCATION_ potentials . the currents were smaller at acidic _LOCATION_ ph and the reversal potential was shifted by mv to more positive values potentially indicating that the transport was additionally dependent on protons . whether the nitrate transport was coupled to proton transfer was analyzed in non voltage clamped oocytes that were loaded with a ph sensitive dye bis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . after the addition of nitrate the _METHOD_ changed in a way that indicated alkalinization of the _LOCATION_ . the signal recovered to the original levels after withdrawal of the . this effect was not observed in control oocytes and suggests that influx was coupled to h efflux similar to the case of clc a but the exact coupling ratio could not be addressed in these experiments . the subcellular localization of clc b was then analyzed using a _METHOD_ fusion protein . the clc b _METHOD_ _METHOD_ surrounded the large central _LOCATION_ in transiently _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis protoplasts as had been shown earlier . a similar _METHOD_ was found for clc c _METHOD_ which had been identified in the _LOCATION_ proteome . the tonoplast _METHOD_ of clc b _METHOD_ was also observed after the isolation of the _LOCATION_ by osmotic shock . control cells _PROTEIN_ untagged _METHOD_ showed a staining in the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ . when stably _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis using the promoter from cauliflower mosaic virus the _METHOD_ tagged clc b was _METHOD_ at the tonoplast around the large central _LOCATION_ . a very similar subcellular localization was obtained for clc c _METHOD_ which is shown in roots in fig . . the developmental regulation and tissue specific _PROTEIN_ of clc b was analyzed using a reporter gene construct containing a kb promoter fragment . this fragment was cloned in front of the _PROTEIN_ reporter gene and wild type plants were transformed with this construct . the _PROTEIN_ pattern was analyzed in homozygous plants from the generation . the promoter activity was visible early after germination . on day _PROTEIN_ was observed in shoots hypocotyls and roots . a weaker promoter activity was detected in mature plants but staining was detected in flowers predominantly in filaments and _PROTEIN_ . this pattern is highly consistent with the _PROTEIN_ pattern deduced from public microarray data _METHOD_ and previous reverse transcription pcr data . the physiological function of clc b was analyzed with two loss of function mutants . both mutant lines carried a t dna insertion in the fifth exon of clc b . the clcb mutant line was isolated from the gabi collection . the t dna insertion in clcb was identified at position after the _PROTEIN_ codon . this results in a truncated clc b mrna that is predicted to encode only a partial clc protein which lacks the large essential cytoplasmic c terminus . northern analysis showed that the clc b transcript was strongly reduced in clcb but a weak signal that may reflect cross reactivity with clc a was observed . the total absence of the full transcript was verified by rt pcr . the second homozygous allele was isolated from the salk collection and had the t dna insertion at position after the _PROTEIN_ codon . this insertion was at a position of the open reading frame that codes for an essential transmembrane domain . consequently the entire functional clc b protein can not be formed in the mutant . the clcb mutant plants were indistinguishable from the wild type when grown in soil . similarly no growth phenotype or developmental effect was observed on agar plates using various nutrient media and light conditions . plants were then grown for d on synthetic media with different nitrate concentrations to determine the chloride and nitrate content . the plant material was harvested h after the beginning of the light period when clc b was maximal in leaves . in the wild type the total nitrate content was slightly higher when the plants were grown on mm nitrate as exclusive nitrogen source compared with plants grown on mm . the addition of mm nacl to induce mild salt stress reduced nitrate by about fold . the total chloride content in contrast was > fold higher when wild type plants were supplemented with mm nacl . the loss of clc b did not affect the nitrate and chloride content in clcb and clcb . furthermore clcb and wild type plants were similarly sensitive to chlorate an analog of nitrate that causes chlorosis and subsequent growth inhibition of seedlings . these data may suggest that clc b was completely dispensable or that its loss was compensated by other transporters potentially clc a . the latter possibility is supported by transcript analysis which identified a high transcript level of clc a that was marginally increased in the clcb mutants .
to generate a translational fusion with _METHOD_ the cdna sequence of clc b was amplified with primers that deleted the stop codon . the resulting pcr fragment was cloned into pcrbluntii _METHOD_ excised and subcloned into a derivate of containing a camv promoter the _METHOD_ coding sequence and the pea rbcs terminator . the same strategy was undertaken for clc c . the pcr amplified fragments were checked by full sequencing of the open reading frame . a bp promoter fragment preceding the genomic sequence of clc b was isolated from genomic dna using the following primers gaggtaccctctctgtctttgttcacataaag and gaggtacccagagtcgacttcgtattc . both primers contained kpni restriction sites to facilitate cloning into ptkan gus . the resulting binary plasmids were introduced into the agrobacterium tumefaciens strain and selected on rifampicin gentamycin and spectinomycin . transformation of col plants was performed by standard procedures and the transgenic plants were selected on plates containing _METHOD_ medium with sucrose and kanamycin . two lines that had an identical gus staining pattern were propagated and homozygous plants were obtained and analyzed . the histochemical analysis of gus activity in pclc b gus lines employed the staining solution mm sodium phosphate mm edta mm _PROTEIN_ mm _PROTEIN_ triton x mm bromo chloro indolyl d _PROTEIN_ acid _PROTEIN_ for h at . a vacuum was applied for a few minutes to facilitate substrate infiltration . the tissues were cleared for several days in ethanol . for axenic growth seeds were germinated in the dark for d on agar plates containing mm mm mm mm _PROTEIN_ na fe edta and mm mes ph adjusted to with tris . the plants were grown at with cycles of h light and h dark conditions . in some experiments plants were propagated on soil in the greenhouse . the t dna insertions disrupting clc b were identified in the salk and gabi collections . the genomic sequence was amplified by pcr and flanking primers _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cttttctctgacctcggcctcc _PROTEIN_ fw aagtgtgg _PROTEIN_ lbg _PROTEIN_ ctcattgc and lbs gcgtggaccgcttgctg caac . actin served as control _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . primers for the _PROTEIN_ analysis of clc a were tctagttaaggctaatcgaaca and tg cacacactcctgcagctgag . rna was isolated using the rneasy plant mini kit . cdna was transcribed from total rna isolated from seedlings using mmlv reverse transcriptase and oligo primer . the pcr amplifications for actin and clc a _PROTEIN_ analysis included cycles . for rna gel blot analyses rna was fractionated on a agarose gel in mm mops naoh at ph with mm sodium acetate mm edta and formaldehyde . the rna was transferred onto a nylon _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ was hybridized with labeled dna probes at in formamide dextran sulfate n laurylsarcosine mm sodium citrate and mm nacl . the _LOCATION_ was washed and the signals were quantified on film . for confocal laser scanning microscopy a leica tcs and nm excitation wavelength were used . the recording bandwidth was chosen between and nm . images were processed in adobe photoshop . this was essentially done as in hechenberger et al . using the identical constructs . capped crna was transcribed from linearized plasmids using the ambion mmessage mmachine kit _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . part of the ovary was removed from deeply anesthetized xenopus frogs by surgery . oocytes were treated with collagenase a for h manually dissected and kept in solution . a ng aliquot was injected per oocyte and prior to the measurements oocytes were incubated for between and days at . two electrode voltage clamping was performed at room temperature using a dagan ca amplifier . the solutions for oocyte recording contained mm mm mm mes and either nacl or mm nacl and mm nabr nai or sodium malate . the ag/agcl reference electrode was connected via a m kcl agar bridge to the bath . intracellular ph changes were monitored using the ph sensitive dye bcecf as described . briefly healthy oocytes were placed in light protected containing bcecf am ester _METHOD_ for min . one or two bcecf loaded oocytes were then washed in mm sorbitol placed in a chamber and covered with a glass coverslip . the oocytes were positioned below an inverted leica _METHOD_ microscope and the oocyte rim was brought into focus . the bcecf _METHOD_ was measured using a spinning wheel _METHOD_ system with excitation at and nm and emission at nm . pictures were taken with a objective every s. after reaching a stable value the initial bathing solution with sorbitol was changed to mm for min and then was changed back to sorbitol . water injected bcecf loaded oocytes were used as controls . the anion content was analyzed from liquid homogenized material by hplc using an ion analyzer equipped with an anion chromatography column from wescan . the eluent was mm phthalic acid with methanol at ph .
