mitochondria are central to cellular metabolism and energy conversion . in plants they also enable photosynthesis through additional components and functional flexibility . a majority of those processes relies on the assembly of individual proteins to larger protein complexes some of which operate as large molecular machines . there has been a strong interest in the makeup and function of mitochondrial protein complexes and protein protein interactions in plants but the experimental approaches used typically suffer from selectivity or bias . here we present a complexome profiling analysis for leaf mitochondria of the model plant arabidopsis thaliana for the systematic characterization of protein assemblies . purified organelle extracts were separated by blue native _PROTEIN_ a resulting gel lane was dissected into slices and proteins in each slice were identified by label free quantitative shot gun proteomics . overall unique proteins were identified which were on average present in complexome fractions each . quantitative profiles of proteins along the bn gel lane were aligned by similarity allowing us to visualize protein assemblies . the data allow re annotating the subunit compositions of oxphos complexes identifying assembly intermediates of oxphos complexes and assemblies of alternative respiratory oxidoreductases . several protein complexes were discovered that have not yet been reported in plants such as a kda tat complex and kda sam complexes a calcium ion uniporter complex and several _PROTEIN_ protein complexes . we have set up a tailored online resource to deposit the data and to allow straightforward access and custom data analyses .
a previous analysis of mitochondrial protein complexes in the model plant arabidopsis thaliana has been carried out for a suspension cell culture _PROTEIN_ in the dark and used for generating a gelmap . however for analyzing mitochondrial functions in the context of photosynthesis mitochondria have to be isolated from green tissues of arabidopsis plants . in a pre experiment for our complexome profiling analysis a mitochondrial protein fraction isolated from arabidopsis leaves was separated by blue native/sds _PROTEIN_ . all visible spots were analyzed by _METHOD_ and a new gelmap was generated for arabidopsis leaf mitochondria . the map includes spots on average proteins were identified per spot . most proteins were identified in more than one spot . overall non redundant proteins are included in the new gelmap all of which were assigned to functional categories . more than of these proteins had not been identified in the previous gelmap project carried out for arabidopsis cell culture mitochondria . this set of proteins includes several enzymes known to be particularly relevant in the context of photosynthesis like the alternative oxidoreductases of the respiratory chain . the new gelmap for arabidopsis leaf mitochondria is accessible at https . an estimation of the purity of our mitochondrial fractions from arabidopsis leaves was carried out by analyzing the subcellular localization of the proteins using the _PROTEIN_ database . this database integrates experimental evidence and bioinformatic predictions to define subcellular localizations for arabidopsis proteins . of the proteins identified in our study could be assigned to the mitochondrial compartment whereas only are predicted to be localized in the chloroplasts . if the same evaluation was carried out on the basis of identified peptides > of the identified peptides belonged to proteins assigned to mitochondria . based on this estimation we consider our mitochondrial fraction of suitable purity for an in depth complexome profiling analysis . for complexome profiling a blue native gel lane of mm length was dissected into gel slices of mm each . all gel slices were analyzed by highly sensitive protein identification technology using uplc runs of h for peptide separation coupled with _METHOD_ runs using an orbitrap _METHOD_ spectrometer for peptide identification and protein quantification . overall _METHOD_ spectra were recorded leading to the identification of peptides . on average proteins were identified per gel slice _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . this adds up to identified proteins overall . however nearly all proteins were identified in several gel slices . this can be for biological or methodological reasons overall unique proteins were identified . on average each protein was detected and quantified in different gel slices . this allowed generating quantitative profiles for the identified proteins along the gel slices . as a final step the quantitative protein profiles were used to generate a heat map and clustered according to profile similarity . the identification of the unique proteins was based on a total of unique peptides . this implies that the average protein is covered by peptides . we again evaluated the purity of our mitochondrial fraction by analyzing the predicted localization of the unique peptides according to the _PROTEIN_ database . overall of the identified unique peptides could be assigned to mitochondrial proteins . to gain quantitative information on peptide distribution with respect to subcellular localization peptide intensities of all complexome fractions were summed up and the predicted subcellular localization of their corresponding proteins were subsequently evaluated using the _PROTEIN_ database . overall of the sum of peptide intensities were assigned to mitochondrial proteins further confirming the purity of the mitochondrial fraction . a critical approach should be taken when interpreting the presence of a protein or protein complex in the dataset as evidence for mitochondrial localization . due to the sensitivity of the chosen _METHOD_ identification technique proteins of very low abundance become detectable . these may represent rare mitochondrial proteins or alternatively abundant proteins of a contaminating compartment . indeed determination of the purity of the mitochondrial fraction depends on the relative abundance of the proteins per complexome fraction included in the calculation . considering the five most abundant proteins per complexome fraction could be assigned to mitochondria according to _PROTEIN_ evaluation . considering the most abundant proteins per complexome fraction only could be assigned to the mitochondrial compartment . if even less abundant proteins were included in the analysis this percentage _PROTEIN_ further . some of the low abundant proteins of the complexome fractions can be ruled out to be present in the mitochondrial proteome like subunits of the two _METHOD_ or of rubisco . we nevertheless included all proteins identified in all our complexome fractions into this study in order to provide a transparent and in depth account of detectable protein protein interactions . despite unavoidable organellar contaminations our dataset provides a long list of proteins potentially localized in mitochondria which should be validated by orthogonal experimental approaches . large numbers of potential protein associations are apparent in the heat map of the mitochondrial complexome based on profile alignments . molecular _METHOD_ calibration of the complexome fractions was carried out using the _METHOD_ of well defined protein complexes . many of the clustered proteins form part of well studied protein complexes for instance the five protein complexes of the oxidative phosphorylation system or protein complexes involved in pre protein import into the mitochondria or in protein folding . in the following sections we will exemplify new insights gained into the subunit composition of known protein complexes as well as the discovery of previously not described protein assemblies . however it is beyond the scope of this article to comment on all putative protein complexes suggested by the complexome profile analysis . instead we consider the complexome dataset a rich resource that we provide to the scientific community for specific evaluations . the five protein complexes of the oxphos system have been well characterized in plants particularly for arabidopsis thaliana . nevertheless the subunit composition of the complexes is not fully defined as the status of some subunits is still under debate and additional subunits are frequently reported . according to most recent analyses complex i of arabidopsis is composed of distinct subunits . in our complexome dataset of these subunits are detected . even peptides of the subunit of arabidopsis were identified which proved to be difficult in the past . several complex i subunits of arabidopsis occur in pairs of _METHOD_ most of which are detected . among the complex i subunits included in our complexome dataset form a cluster on the heat map . all these proteins have highly significant peaks at kda as well as at kda . six further proteins are included in this cluster which do not represent proven complex i subunits . one of these proteins a _PROTEIN_ like protein was previously discussed to be associated with complex i in plants . a similar protein has been shown to be a subunit of arabidopsis complex i before . the five other proteins included in the complex i cluster of our heat map either have peaks at and kda by coincident or they might represent previously unknown proteins associated with complex i . this needs to be analyzed by future investigations . a few well defined complex i subunits are included in our complexome dataset but their abundance profiles do not align with the cluster of other complex i proteins in our heat map . these proteins possibly got detached from the holo complex during protein separation using blue native _PROTEIN_ . in addition to their peaks in the and kda complexome fractions most complex i subunits have minor abundance peaks in fractions in the to kda range . these most likely represent complex i assembly intermediates . the molecular _METHOD_ of some assembly intermediates correspond to previously described complexes of about and kda . others represent intermediates not reported before e.g . of and kda . if abundance profiles of complex i subunits are re aligned excluding the molecular _METHOD_ range above or kda subunits cluster _PROTEIN_ in accordance with the large complex i subdomains the _LOCATION_ and the peripheral arm . complex i from plants includes an extra _PROTEIN_ exposed domain which is attached to the _LOCATION_ arm at a central position . this domain is composed of proteins resembling gamma type _PROTEIN_ anhydrases . in our heat map the _PROTEIN_ anhydrase subunits of complex i form part of a kda subcomplex which has not been described before . complex ii includes four subunits termed _PROTEIN_ in most _METHOD_ investigated . in contrast arabidopsis complex ii is composed of eight subunits . seven of the eight complex ii subunits form a cluster on the heat map of the arabidopsis complexome . the _PROTEIN_ peak of all subunits is at kda . all subunits except _PROTEIN_ form part of additional smaller complexes which might represent assembly intermediates . the kda _PROTEIN_ subunit as well as three _METHOD_ of other _PROTEIN_ subunits were not identified . subunits of complex iii form a highly defined cluster in the complexome dataset . complex iii from higher plants consists of different subunits . nine of the ten subunits are included in the cluster . their _PROTEIN_ peaks are at kda . further peaks are found at kda and at and kda . no complex iii subcomplexes are visible indicating that dimeric complex iii is rapidly formed and stable . the _PROTEIN_ subunit is detached from the complex . two _METHOD_ of other subunits _PROTEIN_ were not identified . complex iv is the least well defined oxphos complex in plants . it includes seven subunits conserved in mitochondria of animals and fungi _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and up to six plant specific subunits which were termed and . our heat map allows an independent evaluation of the assignment of the plant specific subunits to complex iv . complex iv subunits form a well defined cluster in our heat map at kda . besides the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ it includes the subunits and . _PROTEIN_ which was previously reported to be readily detached from arabidopsis complex iv was also identified but is not part of the _PROTEIN_ complex iv cluster . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which are highly hydrophobic were not identified . subunit which has also been identified as a plant homolog of the mammalian mitochondrial calcium uniporter regulator protein mcur is not in the complex iv cluster . subunits and were not identified . in summary only three of the six plant specific complex iv subunits were confirmed . yet abundance profiles of other proteins perfectly align with the complex iv cluster and are candidates for further plant specific subunits . different complex iv containing respiratory supercomplexes are visible at and kda but of low abundance as are complex iv subcomplexes which represent putative assembly intermediates . subunits of complex v _PROTEIN_ cluster at kda . additional clusters are visible at kda _PROTEIN_ . the clusters include subunits and as well as subunits a b d f g fad oscp _PROTEIN_ and the kda subunit . a large fraction of subunit g which is involved in connecting two complexes to the dimeric form is detached from complex v which was reported previously . the c subunit which is very hydrophobic was not identified . several other proteins are included in the complex v cluster . their association with complex v needs to be clarified by further investigations . the respiratory chain of plant mitochondria includes several alternative oxidoreductases . the alternative nadh dehydrogenases _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cluster together with _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have a peak at a slightly smaller position . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ additionally have a minor peak near kda which has been described before . this suggests that the alternative electron transport proteins possibly form alternative respirasomes which exist separately from the classical electron transport complexes . this spatial organization may have important implications on the regulation and partitioning of electron flux through classical versus alternative pathways . it was previously reported that transcripts encoding alternative oxidoreductases are co _PROTEIN_ in plants e.g . the genes encoding _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . several enzymes involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and related pathways also form part of protein complexes . our complexome dataset indicates the following protein assemblies oxoglutarate dehydrogenase malic enzyme fumarase subunits of the succinate dehydrogenase complex subunits of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and citrate synthase . the protein complexes represent homo or heteromeric assemblies of proteins as discussed before . besides the tca cycle enzymes the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ includes many enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism most of them catalyzing catabolic reactions . the complexome data indicate presence of protein complexes for glutamate dehydrogenase cystathionine beta lyase delta _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ dehydrogenase serine hydroxymethyltransferase cysteine desulfurase proline dehydrogenase and several others . the composition of most of these protein complexes is not well established and requires further investigation . the glycine decarboxylase system which has been discussed to form a large protein complex is represented by separate subunits in our mitochondrial complexome fractions . we conclude that this system does either not form a protein complex or _METHOD_ a complex of low stability . dehydrogenases are involved in the tca cycle the respiratory chain and the amino acid metabolism . further dehydrogenases are important for additional processes such as detoxification reactions taking place in mitochondria . two mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenases form a complex of kda . they are involved in acetaldehyde and glycolaldehyde oxidation . formate dehydrogenase is part of a kda complex and a complex including glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase is found at kda . more than different pentatricopeptide repeat _PROTEIN_ and tetratricopeptide repeat proteins are present in our complexome dataset many of which are part of protein assemblies in the molecular _METHOD_ range between and kda e.g . _GENE_ _GENE_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ _GENE_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ _GENE_ _GENE_ _GENE_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ and _GENE_ and _GENE_ . it will be interesting to further investigate these complexes . sequence specific rna binding is a feature of several _PROTEIN_ proteins making members of the _PROTEIN_ family important _PROTEIN_ in posttranscriptional regulation of gene _PROTEIN_ in plant organelles . their specific role in rna editing may require trans _PROTEIN_ and our complexome offers candidates for further investigations . while the specific functions of most of the detected _PROTEIN_ has not yet been determined _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ has recently been found to be dual localized in the _LOCATION_ and the mitochondria . it was reported to interact with the nucleosome assembly protein _PROTEIN_ and the transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ . in the mitochondria _PROTEIN_ is essential for embryo development and associated with polysomes . yet no specific interacting mitochondrial proteins are currently known making the kda complex an attractive starting point for future dissection . _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ another _PROTEIN_ protein found in a complex of kda has previously been described to be a _LOCATION_ regulator of gene _PROTEIN_ by interacting with rna polymerase ii and essential for early embryo development . the possibility of dual localization that is similar to _PROTEIN_ is supported by the observation of mitochondrial targeting in a _PROTEIN_ study several mitochondrial transporters form protein complexes . the recently discovered tatb homolog present in the mitochondria of plants which presumably interacts with a mitochondrially encoded _PROTEIN_ was found to be part of a kda complex . the subunits of the pre protein translocase of the outer mitochondrial _LOCATION_ peak at kda which is in agreement with previous findings . subunits of the sorting and assembly machinery of the outer mitochondrial _LOCATION_ run at kda and at kda on the bn gel . these protein complexes include the and proteins a dnaj homolog and probably further subunits . two components of the putative plant mitochondrial calcium ion uniporter complex mcuc and micu were recently identified in an arabidopsis mitochondrial fraction using _METHOD_ . micu was shown to regulate mitochondrial calcium ion dynamics in vivo while the mcu protein is one of six arabidopsis homologs of mcu a protein forming the pore of the channel complex in mammals . two mcu homologs were also detected in the potato mitochondrial proteome and a very recent functional characterization of one arabidopsis mcu homolog showed channel activity in planar lipid bilayers and inhibition by micu . in mammals mcu needs to assemble into a homo tetrameric or homo pentameric transmembrane complex to make up the pore which needs to associate with regulatory proteins to be a fully functional mcuc . two plant mcu homologs were found in the complexome dataset both clustering together with a quantitative profile peak at kda . this provides important preliminary evidence that also plant mcu proteins form stable multimers . given the molecular weight of individual plant mcu proteins of kda the complex _METHOD_ of kda may indicate a tetra or pentamer if the detected complex contains mcu proteins only . micu showed profile peaks at distinct molecular weights indicating that it was not physically associated with the mcu proteins under the conditions applied . the same was observed for the two arabidopsis homologs of the regulatory protein mcur which is identical to _PROTEIN_ subunit see above section on complex iv and both of which clustered with each other showing quantitative profile peaks at and kda . from the highly similar profiles of both detected mcu proteins it is not possible to discriminate between a complex makeup as homo and/or heteromer . heteromeric mcu channel complexes could facilitate regulation of channel characteristics through modification of its composition . presence of several different mcu proteins in plants may provide particularly rich options for permutation and fine tuning . this hypothesis deserves follow up in the future along with targeted searches for the other mcu homologs . the aim of this study is to exemplify the power of complexome profiling in plants . the principle may be extended to specific tissues cell types or preparations of different subcellular fractions in order to identify novel complexes and/or complex components on a broad scale . we further aim to provide a plant mitochondrial complexome dataset as a novel resource to the community . an online platform for searching the complexome database has been developed to optimize accessibility and to make custom analyses straightforward . two different filtering methods are offered by the software highlighting the lines of one or more arabidopsis accessions to visualize the heat map context of a protein thereby evaluating its possible presence in a protein complex and filtering the heat map to include only the specified proteins of interest . in this mode abundance profiles of distant areas of the heat map can be aligned allowing the identification of possible interactions of the proteins of interest . it is beyond the scope of this article to describe all potential protein assemblies present in the complexome dataset . instead we would like to stimulate further evaluation by the community . hypotheses about novel protein complexes that can be extracted from the dataset should be tested by independent experimental strategies .
