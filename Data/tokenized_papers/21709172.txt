the plant hormone cytokinin is perceived by _LOCATION_ located sensor histidine kinases . arabidopsis possesses three cytokinin receptors _PROTEIN_ histidine _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and cytokinin . the current model predicts perception of the cytokinin signal at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . however cytokinin binding studies with _LOCATION_ fractions separated by two phase partitioning showed that in the wild type as well as in mutants retaining only single cytokinin receptors the major part of specific cytokinin binding was associated with endomembranes . leaf epidermal cells of tobacco _PROTEIN_ receptor green _METHOD_ protein fusion proteins and bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation analysis showed strong _METHOD_ of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ network for all three receptors . furthermore separation of the microsomal fraction of arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ myc tagged _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ receptors by sucrose gradient centrifugation followed by immunoblotting displayed the dependent density shift typical of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins . cytokinin binding assays _METHOD_ fusion proteins and biochemical fractionation all showed that the large majority of cytokinin receptors are localized to the _LOCATION_ suggesting a central role of this compartment in cytokinin signaling . a modified model for cytokinin signaling is proposed .
to gain insight into the cellular compartment harboring the cytokinin receptors isolated _LOCATION_ of d old arabidopsis seedlings were separated using the two phase partitioning method into a pm fraction and an inner _LOCATION_ fraction . microsomes of each fraction retain integral proteins and also proteins associated with these _LOCATION_ . the upper fraction was strongly enriched with a pm marker _PROTEIN_ while the lower fraction showed enrichment of the _LOCATION_ marker binding _PROTEIN_ . the portion of endomembranes was to times higher than that of _METHOD_ as measured by their protein content . an in vitro cytokinin binding assay with microsomes showed trans zeatin specific binding in both _LOCATION_ fractions . quantitative analysis of this binding in wild type plants revealed a high affinity interaction with an equilibrium dissociation constant in the low nanomolar range . this is similar to the kd for trans zeatin receptor complexes of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ chase tm domain _PROTEIN_ in bacteria . the ligand specificity of binding of the isolated _LOCATION_ also corresponded well with the ligand specificity of cloned arabidopsis cytokinin receptors . these results support the idea that the cytokinin binding of isolated _LOCATION_ of arabidopsis is due to these cytokinin receptors . in addition tobacco leaves overexpressing a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion gene showed a strong increase of cytokinin binding in their _LOCATION_ fractions . in microsomes isolated from wild type plants the total specific cytokinin binding was approximately four times higher in the endomembranes than in the pm . considering the higher portion of endomembrane proteins this means that more than of the cytokinin binding sites are located in endomembranes . in order to investigate whether this distribution of binding activity is typical for individual cytokinin receptors of arabidopsis the experiment was repeated with all three double receptor mutants each retaining only a single cytokinin receptor . the cytokinin binding of microsomes from each of the double mutants was lower than that from the wild type which supports further a crucial role of the three known cytokinin receptors to mediate this binding activity . mutants harboring solely the _PROTEIN_ receptor retained the highest binding activity and showed a clear prevalence of cytokinin binding to endomembranes similar to the wild type . a similar pattern was also revealed in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as a single cytokinin receptor . in contrast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ displayed a somewhat higher specific binding in the pm fraction than in the fraction enriched with endomembranes . however because the vast majority of _LOCATION_ proteins are located in endomembranes in this case also more than of the cytokinin binding sites are located in endomembranes . nevertheless this result should be taken with caution because of the overall very low binding activity of microsomes isolated from this double mutant . interestingly the sum of cytokinin binding of _LOCATION_ from all three different double receptor mutants corresponds roughly to the binding activity measured in the wild type . taken together the distribution of cytokinin binding activity in mutants retaining single receptors indicates that all three cytokinin receptors of arabidopsis localize mostly to endomembranes . two phase partitioning had indicated a predominating location of cytokinin binding sites in endomembranes but did not reveal which type of intracellular _LOCATION_ harbors cytokinin receptors . to refine the analysis of their subcellular distribution we fused all three cytokinin receptors with the _METHOD_ . these fusion proteins were transiently _PROTEIN_ under the control of a promoter in the leaf epidermal cells of tobacco and analyzed by laser scanning confocal microscopy . the subcellular localization pattern of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was similar to the pattern known for _LOCATION_ localized proteins . this was further corroborated by a strong perinuclear signal for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which is a hallmark of _LOCATION_ localization . overlay analysis of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal with the dye staining the pm showed only a limited overlap of the signals indicating that most of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein does not localize to the pm but to the _LOCATION_ . a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein showed a similar subcellular distribution in tobacco leaf cells to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . an _LOCATION_ like network was decorated by the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein and a perinuclear signal was detected as well . staining the cells with the pm marker showed little overlap with the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signal supporting its predominant localization in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in the case of _PROTEIN_ neither n nor c terminal fusion with _METHOD_ led to a detectable signal in planta . in contrast bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation analysis for _PROTEIN_ resulted in a clear signal and these data can be used to analyze the subcellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ receptor . the _PROTEIN_ split yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ dimer decorated an _LOCATION_ like intracellular network and perinuclear localization was detected for the _PROTEIN_ split _METHOD_ dimer as well . in summary the subcellular localization of transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins supported a predominant localization to the _LOCATION_ for all three cytokinin receptors . attempts to generate transgenic arabidopsis lines stably _PROTEIN_ the receptor _METHOD_ fusion genes under the control of the promoter have not been successful . none of the transgenic lines that were obtained showed detectable _METHOD_ signal indicating selection against high _PROTEIN_ levels . this finding is in accordance with our inability to obtain transgenic lines constitutively _PROTEIN_ cytokinin receptor genes most likely due to cellular toxicity of the gene products . _METHOD_ based localization experiments do not provide sufficient evidence for determining the true subcellular localization of a given protein especially of endomembrane localized proteins . other methods need to be applied to validate results obtained by _METHOD_ protein fusions therefore a subcellular localization of myc tagged cytokinin receptors following fractionation of cell _LOCATION_ by suc gradient centrifugation was conducted . the functionality of _PROTEIN_ myc and _PROTEIN_ myc fusion proteins was tested by transforming _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant plants which show a distinct phenotype including a small leaf rosette size depending on the simultaneous mutation of both receptor genes . transformed plants _PROTEIN_ chimeric _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ myc or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ myc showed complementation of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype demonstrating the functionality of both ahk myc fusion proteins . two independent transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ the fusion genes were analyzed further . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ myc can not be verified by this complementation test . in addition the level of _PROTEIN_ of a _PROTEIN_ myc gene was too low to reliably detect the tagged receptor protein which is in accordance with the low cytokinin binding activity of microsomes from the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant . therefore _PROTEIN_ myc transgenic plants were not included in this study . first _LOCATION_ of and d old _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ myc plants and d old _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ myc transgenic plants were isolated and fractionated using the two phase partitioning method . immunoblots showed the expected distribution of the pm bound h _PROTEIN_ and the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ to the and fractions respectively . large majorities of both tagged receptors _PROTEIN_ myc and _PROTEIN_ myc were detected in the fraction corroborating an endomembrane localization for these two cytokinin receptors . in order to identify the intracellular _LOCATION_ fraction to which _PROTEIN_ myc and _PROTEIN_ myc localize more precisely the microsomal fraction was further separated by suc gradient centrifugation either in the presence or absence of ions . the rationale behind this approach is that binding of ribosomes to the _LOCATION_ is dependent on the presence of ions . in the absence of ions the release of ribosomes from the _LOCATION_ lowers the density of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and thus leads to a shift within the suc gradient . in contrast other organelles are not significantly affected in their density by ions . the marker proteins belonging to different _LOCATION_ types were detected by immunoblotting . to study the intracellular distribution of _PROTEIN_ myc d old arabidopsis seedlings and shoots of d old plants were used as starting material . the position of the _LOCATION_ bound fraction of the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ was clearly shifted upon depletion of ions from the extraction buffer whereas the pattern obtained for the markers of the pm and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were largely independent of the presence of ions . chlorophyll absorbance which was measured as a marker for the chloroplast _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ also did not show the characteristic shift of _PROTEIN_ . the position of _PROTEIN_ myc in the gradient was similar to that of _PROTEIN_ in showing a clear shift upon depletion from the buffer . the position in the gradient of _PROTEIN_ udpase an enzyme marker for the _LOCATION_ apparatus was also dependent on but its position and peak distribution in the fractions were less well correlated with the positions of _PROTEIN_ myc and _PROTEIN_ especially visible in d old shoots . cytochrome c oxidase subunit ii _PROTEIN_ a marker for mitochondria and adp ribosylation _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a marker for the trans _LOCATION_ network were also tested in this material . the positions of these markers shifted only marginally to fractions of lower suc concentrations in the free buffer . taken together the behavior of proteins isolated from d old seedlings and shoots of d old plants was qualitatively similar indicating that the localization of _PROTEIN_ myc to the _LOCATION_ is independent of the plant age . the localization study of _PROTEIN_ myc yielded similar results . after fractionation in a suc gradient in the presence or absence of ions a diagnostic shift of the _PROTEIN_ myc position was detected that resembled the one of the _LOCATION_ fraction of _PROTEIN_ . the markers for other _LOCATION_ showed a much weaker shift in the absence of ions and/or their positions in the gradient were not correlated with the position of _PROTEIN_ myc .
