_PROTEIN_ and rna polymerase iv are required for dna methylation guided by nucleotide small interfering rnas in arabidopsis thaliana . here we show that _PROTEIN_ localizes to nucleolus associated bodies along with the pol iv subunit _PROTEIN_ the small _LOCATION_ rna binding protein _PROTEIN_ and two markers of cajal bodies trimethylguanosine capped snrnas and the snrna binding protein . _PROTEIN_ interacts with the c terminal domain of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ protein stability depends on upstream _PROTEIN_ that synthesize sirnas . _PROTEIN_ is also found along with the dna methyltransferase _PROTEIN_ throughout the _LOCATION_ at presumed dna methylation target sites . cajal bodies are conserved sites for the maturation of ribonucleoprotein complexes . our results suggest a function for cajal bodies as a center for the assembly of an _PROTEIN_ complex facilitating its function in rna directed gene silencing at target loci .
we constructed an n terminally epitope tagged _PROTEIN_ transgene by engineering four copies of the myc tag into a genomic complementing fragment of _PROTEIN_ driven by its native promoter . the functionality of myc _PROTEIN_ was confirmed by its ability to restore silencing of the endogenous _PROTEIN_ locus in the _PROTEIN_ clk st mutant line . first generation myc _PROTEIN_ transformed _PROTEIN_ clk st plants displayed highly penetrant restoration of a silenced _PROTEIN_ floral phenotype of extra stamens and unfused carpels indicating that the transgene is functional . as a second verification of functionality we showed that myc _PROTEIN_ restored rna directed asymmetric dna methylation at _PROTEIN_ isr in the _PROTEIN_ mutant using a dna methylation cutting assay . western blot analysis of crude protein extract generated from a myc _PROTEIN_ plant showed a single band close to the predicted size of kda and no crossreactivity with other plant proteins . _PROTEIN_ was previously shown to be a _LOCATION_ localized protein in transient _PROTEIN_ assays in nicotiana benthamiana leaves . we utilized c myc antibodies and _METHOD_ microscopy to examine _PROTEIN_ subnuclear localization when the protein was _PROTEIN_ from its native promoter . we identified two key localization patterns . first _PROTEIN_ displayed a euchromatic localization throughout the _LOCATION_ that showed lower signal in dapi staining chromocenters . chromocenters are highly condensed heterochromatic dna that contain centromeric and pericentromeric repeat sequences . the exclusion of _PROTEIN_ from chromocenters is consistent with previous data demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ did not affect silencing at centromeric repeats or the pericentromeric locus . instead _PROTEIN_ is important for silencing at dna methylated loci found in otherwise euchromatic regions such as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ both of which are localized away from chromocenters . second _METHOD_ analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ localized to a distinct body either adjacent to or within the nucleolus . in a small fraction of _LOCATION_ we observed a second or third _PROTEIN_ body usually associated with additional nucleoli . to test whether the _PROTEIN_ body might correspond to one of the chromocenters we performed dna _METHOD_ in situ hybridization with a probe that recognizes the base pair centromeric repeat sequences and hybridizes to all of the chromocenters . we found that the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ bodies did not colocalize with centromeric repeats suggesting that they are not chromocenters . the _PROTEIN_ mutant shows reduced histone lysine dimethylation at _PROTEIN_ target loci such as _PROTEIN_ and . to test whether the _PROTEIN_ body might be a site of concentrated targeting we stained _LOCATION_ with an antibody specific for . the _PROTEIN_ body did not stain with . furthermore localization of myc _PROTEIN_ and were anticorrelated likely reflecting the _PROTEIN_ that most resides in chromocenters while a lower amount of is found at scattered silent loci in euchromatin . we also examined the colocalization of _PROTEIN_ with trimethylated lysine of histone a mark of genes silenced by polycomb group proteins that reside outside of chromocenters . we found that the _PROTEIN_ body did not stain with and that the _PROTEIN_ signal outside of the _LOCATION_ body was generally similar to that of in that both were concentrated outside of dapi staining chromocenters . to test whether the localization of _PROTEIN_ is dependent on upstream rnai components we crossed myc _PROTEIN_ into homozygous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant backgrounds . by _METHOD_ microscopy both the _LOCATION_ body and euchromatic staining of _PROTEIN_ were dramatically reduced in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants . for _PROTEIN_ of _LOCATION_ displayed a dramatic _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ levels while the other showed wild type _PROTEIN_ levels . it has been demonstrated previously that _PROTEIN_ has weaker effects than _PROTEIN_ on sirna levels and dna methylation . thus the difference between the two _PROTEIN_ populations might be explained by either stochastic or cell type specific redundancy with other dcl genes . to determine whether the _PROTEIN_ of _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ was due to overall protein loss or a defect in _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ localization a semiquantitative western blot of crude protein extract from mutant plants was used to measure _PROTEIN_ levels . myc _PROTEIN_ protein levels were _PROTEIN_ moderately in _PROTEIN_ and severely in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants . these _PROTEIN_ were not due to transcriptional repression of the transgene since myc _PROTEIN_ transcripts were at similar levels in the various mutant and wild type backgrounds . in contrast to the rna silencing mutants a mutation in the dna methyltransferase gene _PROTEIN_ which likely acts downstream of _PROTEIN_ had no effect on myc _PROTEIN_ localization or protein level . these results suggest that the upstream components _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are needed for stabilizing _PROTEIN_ . since _PROTEIN_ is a downstream component in the _PROTEIN_ dependent rddm pathway it is possible that _PROTEIN_ might have the same localization pattern as _PROTEIN_ . to investigate this a myc tagged genomic _PROTEIN_ controlled by its native promoter was generated . we demonstrated functionality of the transgene by showing that it restored dna methylation at _PROTEIN_ isr in a _PROTEIN_ mutant . by _METHOD_ microscopy _PROTEIN_ showed a euchromatic localization that was reduced in dapi staining chromocenters in a manner analogous to _PROTEIN_ . however unlike myc _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ myc was not found in a distinct body near the nucleolus . these results are consistent with the idea that _PROTEIN_ acts with _PROTEIN_ at rddm target loci but not in the _PROTEIN_ body . we previously showed that a mutation in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ blocked de novo dna methylation of a newly introduced _PROTEIN_ transgene resulting in overexpression of the transgene and a _PROTEIN_ flowering phenotype . this same defect in establishment of dna methylation was seen in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . we asked whether _PROTEIN_ was also involved in the _PROTEIN_ dependent de novo dna methylation pathway by subjecting the _PROTEIN_ mutant to the same de novo methylation assay . similar to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was unable to silence the _PROTEIN_ transgene as indicated by a _PROTEIN_ flowering phenotype when compared to wild type . this result suggests that both _METHOD_ of pol iv _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are involved in _PROTEIN_ dependent de novo dna methylation . because both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ phenocopied _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ transformation assay it is possible that _PROTEIN_ might be functioning directly with pol iv . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ is acting in concert with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ localization of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ was examined in myc _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ using specific antibodies to _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . by _METHOD_ microscopy _PROTEIN_ did not colocalize with _PROTEIN_ . although _PROTEIN_ showed localization to small speckles in the _LOCATION_ none of these _PROTEIN_ dots corresponded to the _PROTEIN_ body . in contrast _PROTEIN_ localized to the same nucleolar bodies as _PROTEIN_ did . this result demonstrates that the nucleolar body is not an _PROTEIN_ exclusive phenomenon and is relevant to other rnai components involved in rna directed dna methylation . we also tested the effect of mutations in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ on _PROTEIN_ localization . similarly to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants the myc _PROTEIN_ signal in _LOCATION_ was dramatically reduced in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . in contrast _PROTEIN_ had no effect on _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ localization patterns either at the _PROTEIN_ body or outside of chromocenters . overall these results are consistent with _PROTEIN_ 's acting upstream of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ 's acting either at the same step or downstream of _PROTEIN_ . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ might form stable high molecular weight complexes with other proteins we performed gel filtration chromatography with whole cell lysates from myc _PROTEIN_ plants . we observed that while the majority of total _PROTEIN_ protein eluted at the size predicted for a monomer a significant fraction of _PROTEIN_ was present in two high molecular weight complexes of around kda and greater than kda . the colocalization of _PROTEIN_ with myc _PROTEIN_ suggested the possibility that these proteins might interact . consistent with this notion we found that the elution profile of _PROTEIN_ correlated with the high molecular weight _PROTEIN_ complexes . to test whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are stably associated we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments . we found that antibodies specific for _PROTEIN_ coprecipitated myc _PROTEIN_ . antibodies to _PROTEIN_ however did not coprecipitate myc _PROTEIN_ . one structural difference between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is the presence of a large reiterated c terminal domain in _PROTEIN_ . a reiterated ctd is also found in the largest subunit of rna polymerase ii _PROTEIN_ where it serves as a binding site for other proteins and its phosphorylation is involved in the transition of rna polymerase ii from a preinitiation state to elongation . we therefore tested whether _PROTEIN_ might interact with the _PROTEIN_ ctd in either its phosphorylated or unphosphorylated _METHOD_ by testing the ability of bacterially produced ctd glutathione s transferase fusion protein to capture myc _PROTEIN_ from crude protein extracts . we found that _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ bound strongly to the _PROTEIN_ ctd . in vitro phosphorylation of the _PROTEIN_ ctd neither enhanced nor inhibited binding to myc _PROTEIN_ . these data together with the coimmunoprecipitation and colocalization results strongly suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interact with one another . _PROTEIN_ is involved in dna methylation at the rdna genes and immunoprecipitated _PROTEIN_ contains and sirnas which also localize to the _PROTEIN_ body . we therefore examined whether the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ body may represent a concentrated localization of _PROTEIN_ at the or rdna loci . by dna fish analysis the _PROTEIN_ body did not colocalize with the nucleolar organizer regions which contain the rdna genes or with the rdna genes . these findings suggest that the _PROTEIN_ body is likely not a major site of rna directed dna methylation at _PROTEIN_ target loci which is also consistent with the _PROTEIN_ that _PROTEIN_ is not enriched at the _PROTEIN_ body . to learn more about the nature of the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ body we searched for proteins that display the same subnuclear localization as _PROTEIN_ . a recent study showed localization of a large number of nucleolar associated proteins in arabidopsis . several of these proteins including an arabidopsis homolog of the small _LOCATION_ rna binding protein _PROTEIN_ displayed localization to a body in or near the nucleolus . _PROTEIN_ is a core protein component of the and small _LOCATION_ ribonucleoproteins which are central components of the spliceosome . we transformed myc _PROTEIN_ plants with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and generated a stable line _PROTEIN_ both fusion proteins . we observed a nearly perfect colocalization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and myc _PROTEIN_ both predominantly labeling a nucleolar or perinucleolar body . the cajal body is a well studied _LOCATION_ compartment that is involved in the processing and maturation of several types of ribonucleoprotein complexes . for instance snrnps are posttranscriptionally modified and associate with specific proteins in the cajal body before leaving the cajal body to participate in splicing . because of the localization of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ we hypothesized that the _PROTEIN_ body might be a cajal body . this hypothesis was supported by our finding that the _PROTEIN_ body stained poorly with dapi and by previous work showing that cajal bodies in arabidopsis and many other plants are often associated with nucleoli . we utilized two antibodies that recognize reliable markers of plant cajal bodies the trimethylguanosine cap of snrnas and the specific snrna binding protein . snrnas are tmg modified in the cytoplasm and are then imported to the _LOCATION_ where they temporarily accumulate in cajal bodies . tmg caps are found on arabidopsis snrnas and tmg capped snrnas are markers of cajal bodies in arabidopsis and other plant species . the protein specifically associates with arabidopsis tmg capped snrna and colocalizes with tmg capped snrnas and with the core snrna binding protein smb at arabidopsis cajal bodies . has been used in studies of the behavior of cajal bodies in arabidopsis and other plants and colocalizes in arabidopsis with an antibody recognizing _PROTEIN_ a protein specifically found in cajal bodies . we tested whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ colocalize with these cajal body markers . _LOCATION_ from _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants were stained with monoclonal antibodies against tmg and . we observed a nearly perfect colocalization of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ with both tmg capped snrnas and . to examine the colocalization of myc _PROTEIN_ with cajal body markers we utilized a myc polyclonal antibody together with monoclonal tmg and antibodies . although the polyclonal myc antibody gave a somewhat higher background than the monoclonal myc antibody used throughout the rest of this study the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ body was still clearly evident . we observed a nearly perfect colocalization of myc _PROTEIN_ with both the tmg snrnas and signals . these findings strongly suggest that _PROTEIN_ bodies correspond to cajal bodies . to determine whether upstream rna silencing mutants affect the integrity of cajal bodies we tested the localization of tmg snrnas and in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . neither mutant showed reduced staining of cajal body markers . thus while these mutants eliminate _PROTEIN_ association with cajal bodies they do not disrupt the basic integrity of the cajal body or the localization of snrnas or .
