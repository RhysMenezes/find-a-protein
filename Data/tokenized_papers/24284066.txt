crosslinking of actin filaments into bundles is essential for the assembly and stabilization of specific cytoskeletal structures . however relatively little is known about the molecular _METHOD_ underlying actin bundle formation . the two lim domain containing proteins define a novel and evolutionarily conserved family of actin bundling proteins whose actin binding and crosslinking activities primarily rely on their lim domains . using _PROTEIN_ microscopy we describe real time formation of actin bundles induced by tobacco in vitro . we show that binds to single filaments and subsequently promotes their interaction and zippering into tight bundles of mixed _PROTEIN_ . induced bundles grew by both elongation of internal filaments and addition of preformed fragments at their extremities . importantly these data are highly consistent with the modes of bundle formation and growth observed in transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ a _METHOD_ fused arabidopsis protein . using two complementary live cell imaging approaches a close relationship between subcellular localization and self association was established . indeed both bifc and flim fret data revealed that although unstable complexes can sporadically form in the _LOCATION_ stable complexes concentrate along the actin _LOCATION_ . remarkably disruption of the actin _LOCATION_ significantly impaired self association of . in addition biochemical analyses support the idea that f actin facilitates the switch of purified recombinant from a monomeric to a di or oligomeric state . on the basis of our data we propose a model in which actin binding promotes the formation and stabilization of complexes which in turn might drive the crosslinking of actin filaments .
we previously reported that promotes the formation of actin bundles in vitro and in live cells . here we aimed to characterize bundling activity in a more quantitative manner as well as the underlying molecular _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ labeled actin filaments were co polymerized with of and subsequently imaged by _PROTEIN_ microscopy . the corresponding pictures were pseudo colored as a function of pixel _METHOD_ intensities whose distributions were illustrated by _METHOD_ . in control experiments single actin filaments formed a randomly organized array . in the presence of filaments assembled into long and rather straight bundles . noticeably actin bundles grew larger with increasing concentrations . _METHOD_ intensity based measurements revealed that a maximal average number of filaments per bundle was reached at an actin to ratio of . consistently the same actin to ratio yielded the highest skewness value . the distribution of along emerging actin bundles was assessed using a protein labeled with hilyte . remarkably promoted the formation of actin bundles in a similar manner to unlabeled . as shown in supplementary material fig . c was distributed along the whole length of actin bundles . to test the ability of to bind to individual filaments we lowered the lim to actin ratio and thereby kept a large fraction of filaments in a non bundled form . for a higher resolution samples were immobilized onto nem myosin coated coverslips and imaged by _PROTEIN_ microscopy . decorated a mixture of bundles and fine fibers which we assumed to be individual non crosslinked actin filaments . interestingly as revealed by rhodamine phalloidin co labeling the _METHOD_ signal intensity due to directly correlated with bundle _PROTEIN_ . a close up of the decorated and rhodamine phalloidin co labeled fine fibers confirmed that they exhibited a shape and intensity that was similar to those of control filaments polymerized without lim . we therefore conclude that can efficiently bind to individual actin filaments and that this event probably precedes actin filament crosslinking . the formation of actin bundles induced by was monitored by time lapse _PROTEIN_ microscopy . in the absence of growing actin filaments occasionally co aligned in a transient manner but never formed bundles of two or more filaments over a long distance and/or time . the addition of promoted _PROTEIN_ contacts between filaments and their subsequent crosslinking in parallel bundles . in two representative examples the extremity of an individual filament contacted a close by fine bundle in its terminal or more central region respectively and subsequently fused with this bundle by a zippering like process . induced bundles were observed to elongate by two distinct _METHOD_ . on the one hand they grew at their terminal regions by the addition of pre formed short filaments . interestingly these short filaments sometimes undertook several docking attempts before finally joining the targeted bundle . these touch and flip events probably reflect local steric and/or electrostatic constraints which favor a preferential relative orientation between the added filament fragments and growing bundles . on the other hand bundle elongation was achieved through polymerization of the inside filaments . as shown by the kymograph in fig . filaments elongate with similar growth rates both inside and at the extremities of bundles . in addition we calculated similar average growth rates for bundled actin filaments and individual actin filaments polymerized alone indicating that _PROTEIN_ does not significantly alter the actin polymerization rate . advanced live cell imaging approaches have recently enabled high resolution monitoring of actin _LOCATION_ remodeling in plant cells . to validate and extend our in vitro biochemical data on lim protein mediated actin bundle assembly we applied variable angle _METHOD_ microscopy on nicotiana benthamiana seedlings transiently _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . in particular we wanted to answer the following questions does bind to individual actin filaments in live cells ? if so do such filaments undergo bundling through _METHOD_ similar to those observed in in vitro reconstituted assays ? in hypocotyl epidermal cells _METHOD_ decorated single actin filaments which elongated by fast polymerization and disintegrated by severing and depolymerization events . moreover we noticed pair wise interaction between single filaments or fine bundles which subsequently zippered into _PROTEIN_ fibers . because the biolistic approach used to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in tobacco hypocotyl only resulted in a low number of transformed cortical epidermal cells and variable transgene _PROTEIN_ levels we switched to transgenic arabidopsis seedlings stably _PROTEIN_ the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ protein fused to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ to conduct more quantitative and statistically relevant analyses . noticeably shares sequence similarity with and exhibits equivalent actin binding and bundling activities in vitro . as in the tobacco system _METHOD_ extensively decorated actin _LOCATION_ components in arabidopsis hypocotyl cells ranging from individual filaments to _PROTEIN_ bundles . in agreement with previous imaging studies using standard _METHOD_ f actin reporters actin _LOCATION_ remodeling was dominated by fast polymerization and prolific severing . tracking of individual filaments revealed that many of them were readily destroyed by severing and usually exhibited lifetimes < seconds . to check whether the binding of to single actin filaments affects the dynamics of these filaments in vivo we quantified well defined stochastic dynamics parameters such as filament elongation rates severing frequency and convolutedness in the cortex of hypocotyl epidermal cells from day old arabidopsis seedlings _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or the widely used _METHOD_ actin marker . both filament elongation rates and severing frequency showed statistically significant but modest differences in _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ seedlings . in addition filament convolutedness was not statistically different in _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ plants . together these findings indicate that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ is not detrimental to single actin filament dynamics . in addition every optical section analyzed over a period of seconds revealed filaments that interacted with each other and subsequently zippered into bundles . since several zippering events could be observed over the whole time of observation we concluded that these events are relatively frequent and represent a major mode of actin bundle formation in vivo . statistical quantification analyses of these events in _METHOD_ hypocotyl epidermal cells yielded a bundling frequency of zippering . a parallel analysis conducted in the hypocotyls of seedlings _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ indicated a threefold lower frequency of filament bundling processes . together these data are consistent with an in vivo actin bundling activity of . compared with individual filaments _METHOD_ labeled actin bundles exhibited less convoluted shapes and longer lifetimes . as in based in vitro bundling assays bundles grew by both elongation of internal filaments and fusion/recycling of nearby severed filament fragments . in addition to straight bundles some _PROTEIN_ shaped bundles were observed to form through actin filament circularization . similar _PROTEIN_ shaped bundles have been previously referred to as acquosomes and have been proposed to serve as actin storage organelles . however because we never observed acquosomes in vitro their formation probably requires additional or simply _PROTEIN_ other than lim proteins . on the whole live cell analyses are highly consistent with our in vitro data and support a model in which lim proteins bind to both individual filaments and bundles and promote the zippering of filaments or bundles that come into contact with each other . furthermore the unaffected dynamics of single decorated filaments support the idea that _PROTEIN_ proteins promote actin bundling directly through their actin crosslinking activity . depending on their respective functions actin bundles can be either of uniform _PROTEIN_ with the barbed ends of all filaments pointing in the same direction or of mixed _PROTEIN_ . to measure the _PROTEIN_ of induced actin bundles we first measured actin bundle _PROTEIN_ using a dual labeling _METHOD_ microscopy assay . in brief actin was co polymerized with and subsequently labeled by alexa fluor phalloidin . these bundles were incubated with profilin bound actin monomers in order to inhibit actin polymerization at the pointed end of filaments and resume filament elongation exclusively at the barbed end . finally these newly polymerized bundle sections were labeled with rhodamine phalloidin . data revealed that of induced bundles resumed bi directional growth as indicated by red filaments emerging from each extremity of the green initial bundle . the rest of the bundles showed a unipolar conformation with only one of their extremities labeled in red . by contrast control experiments with the human actin bundling protein fascin yielded almost exclusively unipolar bundles a result consistent with the high selectivity previously reported for fascin . to further examine actin filament orientation in triggered bundles we traced fast barbed end elongation of individual and bundled filaments using real time _PROTEIN_ microscopy . the majority of bundles contained several filaments that grew in opposite directions . in addition we regularly observed that anti parallel filaments although elongating toward each other crossed and continued their growth along the bundle axis . in accordance with the above dual _METHOD_ labeling experiments some induced bundles exhibited an exclusively parallel filament orientation . together these data indicate that has no or only weak selectivity for actin filament _PROTEIN_ and predominantly generates bundles of mixed _PROTEIN_ . to extend the above data we tracked the orientation of elongating filaments after they zippered into fine growing bundles in arabidopsis hypocotyl cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . data show that of filaments that zipper into a thin bundle were elongating in the same direction whereas the rest of the analyzed population grew in opposite directions . these findings are therefore consistent with the above characterized weak intrinsic selectivity of for actin filament _PROTEIN_ . it should be noted that we could not reliably characterize the relative orientation of actin filaments in _PROTEIN_ bundles . we assume that most of these bundles have a mixed _PROTEIN_ although this awaits confirmation . the dimerization of in live cells as well as its potential implication in actin bundling were directly assessed by two complementary approaches namely bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation and _METHOD_ resonance energy transfer based on _METHOD_ lifetime imaging microscopy . in the first set of experiments two bifc constructs consisting of complementary n terminal and c terminal fragments of the enhanced yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fused to were co _PROTEIN_ in tobacco by cells and checked for their association . an intense signal of reconstituted _METHOD_ indicative of interaction was observed in almost of cells . remarkably as revealed by treatment with the f actin disrupting drug latrunculin b bifc complexes sharply decorated the actin _LOCATION_ . this contrasted with the dual diffuse cytoplasmic and cytoskeletal localization observed when was fused to full length _METHOD_ . together these data support the idea that complexes concentrate along the actin _LOCATION_ and might hint at the existence of monomeric and di/oligomeric pools . however we can not exclude the possibility that the diffuse cytoplasmic localization observed for _METHOD_ results from the interference of the full length _METHOD_ tag with self association and/or by the elevated levels of overexpressed _METHOD_ and resulting cytoplasmic accumulation of the fusion protein occurring on top of its appropriate cytoskeletal localization . no significant _METHOD_ could be detected in control cells transformed with the two empty bifc vectors nor with yn or yc on the one hand and the complementary empty vector on the other hand . to confirm that the formation of bifc complexes was not only due to the close vicinity of both bifc constructs on the actin _LOCATION_ we performed additional control assays with complementary bifc constructs respectively fused to _PROTEIN_ and another actin filament binding protein namely the actin binding domain of arabidopsis . in contrast to the strong signal typically observed for complexes no _METHOD_ could be detected in of cells co _PROTEIN_ yn and yc . the rest of cells exhibited significant but relatively weak _METHOD_ . this bifc signal could be entirely abolished by pre treating cells with lat b indicating that it was due to unspecific bifc complexes that formed along the _LOCATION_ . however as previously stated both the frequency and intensity of unspecific actin associated bifc complexes were much lower than those observed for bifc complexes supporting the specificity of the latter . in addition to bifc analyses self interaction was evaluated using flim based fret measurements . basically the extent of quenching of a donor fluorophore lifetime by an acceptor fluorophore allowed us to quantitatively evaluate the physical interaction between the respectively fused candidate proteins . c terminal fusions of to amcyan and _METHOD_ were used as donor and acceptor constructs _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . for amcyan alone we measured a _METHOD_ lifetime of nseconds a value similar to those previously published for amcyan based donor constructs . in the presence of _METHOD_ the overall _METHOD_ lifetime of amcyan significantly _PROTEIN_ indicating the presence of complexes . importantly particularly low values were reached along the actin _LOCATION_ supporting the asymmetrical subcellular distribution of complexes . along actin bundles we measured an average lifetime of nseconds corresponding to a fret efficiency of . as a control we performed additional flim fret analyses on cells co _PROTEIN_ amcyan and _METHOD_ fusions of and . although _METHOD_ decorated the actin _LOCATION_ similar to amcyan no significant change of amcyan _METHOD_ lifetime was noticed . indeed we measured an amcyan lifetime of nseconds corresponding to a fret efficiency of a value below the typical significance threshold . together these data confirm the bifc analyses and provide compelling evidence that self associates along the actin _LOCATION_ . both bifc and flim fret analyses revealed self association and highlighted the preferential localization of complexes to the actin _LOCATION_ . because the two lim domains of were previously shown to function as autonomous actin bundling modules in vitro we hypothesized that they hold the ability to self associate . therefore the single lim domains of namely and were fused to either _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ and assessed for their interaction ability in by cells using flim fret analyses . consistent with the lack of actin binding activity previously reported for and in live cells flim fret constructs exhibited a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution . donor constructs _METHOD_ _METHOD_ yielded an unquenched _METHOD_ _METHOD_ lifetime average of nseconds and nseconds respectively . when _METHOD_ was co _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ lifetime average _PROTEIN_ to nseconds and nseconds respectively . similarly when _METHOD_ was co _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ the overall _METHOD_ _METHOD_ lifetime _PROTEIN_ to nseconds . in all cases fret efficiencies were below the typical threshold suggesting no significant interaction between lim domains . however we noticed on lifetime images that obvious _METHOD_ quenching occurred in small restricted cytoplasmic areas a phenomenon that was not observed with donor constructs alone . we therefore suspected that single lim domains could sporadically assemble into weak complexes that accumulate in the whole cytoplasm . supporting such a scenario quantitative analyses conducted on restricted positive cytoplasmic areas chosen from lifetime images yielded fret efficiencies ranging from to for the different lim domain combinations . by contrast only background fret efficiencies were obtained from co _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ with the _METHOD_ fusion of either or the c terminal domain of . although the above data supported transient interactions between lim domains this required further confirmation . of interest bifc complexes have been reported to over stabilize protein interactions thereby displacing the equilibrium toward the dimeric form of the proteins fused to the complementary _METHOD_ fragments . this property which is sometimes considered to be a disadvantage provides the opportunity to reveal transient and weak interactions . we therefore conducted additional bifc experiments to assess self association of single lim domains . various combinations of and bifc constructs were tested . they all yielded an intense and diffuse _METHOD_ signal in the cytoplasm of by cells revealing on the one hand the formation of and homomers in and of transformed cells respectively and the formation of heteromers in about of transformed cells . remarkably no _METHOD_ _METHOD_ could be detected in cells co transformed with either or bifc construct and a complementary bifc construct . in conclusion these data are highly consistent with our flim fret analyses and confirm that lim domains can form homo and heteromeric complexes although they are much less stable than full length complexes . the difference in the ability to self associate between single lim domains and full length is intriguing . because contrary to single lim domains do not bind to the actin _LOCATION_ in live cells and because complexes concentrate along actin bundles we wondered whether the weak interaction between single lim domains could be related to their inability to bind the actin _LOCATION_ . the induction of protein self association by actin binding has already been reported for the actin bundling protein vinculin and recently the association of villin with f actin has been shown to promote villin dimerization . based on these observations we wondered whether the actin _LOCATION_ could directly promote the formation and/or stabilization of dimers or oligomers . to answer this question we first investigated the assembly state of recombinant in the absence of f actin using size exclusion chromatography and dynamic light scattering experiments . collectively these approaches provide strong evidence that exhibits a single lower oligomeric state . however the lack of knowledge about the spatial conformation of precludes a definite conclusion on the precise oligomeric state of . we thus performed sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation experiments . the data established that has an elongated confirmation and behaves as a monomer . none of the above approaches is appropriate to examine the oligomeric state of the presence of f actin . as an alternative we determined the to actin molar ratio at saturation in low speed cosedimentation assays conducted at fixed actin levels and increasing concentrations . from four independent experiments we calculated an average of bound per actin subunit . this result was very consistent with live cell data and further indicates that switches from monomeric to a di or oligomeric state when associated with f actin . in an attempt to directly characterize complexes the protein was incubated with f actin and the samples were subsequently mixed with a mercaptoethanol deprived buffer and analyzed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the species formed under these non reducing conditions were analyzed by western blotting . in control samples without f actin was mostly detected at the expected monomeric size . however an additional very faint band of approximately twice the size was scarcely detectable supporting a predisposition of for self association . consistent with this idea and the promoting effect of f actin previously indicated by cosedimentation data the higher band was markedly enhanced in the presence of f actin . in a control blot actin was detected at its expected size i.e . kda . the ability of to self associate was further tested by incubating the protein with the chemical crosslinker _PROTEIN_ . as expected _PROTEIN_ promoted the formation of kda complexes . additional higher bands of low intensity suggest that can reach different oligomeric states although unspecific chemical crosslinking of can not be excluded . together these data strongly suggest that self association is promoted and/or enhanced by f actin . to confirm that efficient self association of relies on an intact actin _LOCATION_ in live cells additional flim fret analyses were conducted on by cells treated with the actin disrupting drug lat b . data revealed that the donor lifetime average _PROTEIN_ in the presence of _METHOD_ acceptor from nseconds to nseconds corresponding to a fret efficiency below the significance threshold . however similar to what we observed with single lim domains some restricted cytoplasmic areas exhibited a greater reduction in amcyan _METHOD_ lifetime . quantitative analysis of amcyan _METHOD_ lifetime limited to those areas yielded a lifetime average of nseconds corresponding to a significant fret efficiency of . by contrast no such fret positive areas were observed in control experiments conducted with _METHOD_ . thus when deprived of an intact actin _LOCATION_ exhibits a reduced ability to form complexes .
coding sequences of its two lim domains and were amplified by pcr . for bifc analyses coding sequences were ligated into vectors pspyne and pspyce which allow the _PROTEIN_ of proteins fused to the n terminal part or c terminal part of _METHOD_ respectively . constructs used for flim fret analyses were _PROTEIN_ derived from previously described in house plasmids and where existing _METHOD_ fusion constructs of and the c terminal domain were changed into the reporter gene fusions of interest _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the flim control plasmid _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was a derivative of the pspyne vector in which the initial n terminal _METHOD_ fragment was replaced with full length _METHOD_ and the coding sequence was subcloned in frame with _METHOD_ . a previously described construct allowing the

dialysed against mm tris hcl ph mm nacl mm dtt . following protein pre clarification at g of rabbit muscle actin _LOCATION_ were polymerized in the presence of increasing concentrations for hour at room temperature in mm tris hcl ph mm mm kcl mm mm _PROTEIN_ and mm dtt . samples were then centrifuged for minutes at g. the resulting pellet and supernatant fractions were analyzed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the respective amounts of were quantified using imagej . to calculate the molar to actin ratio at saturation the ratio of bound versus total actin concentration was plotted against the respective total concentration and the data points of one experiment were fitted to a hyperbolic function . the value indicated in the results corresponds to the mean of four independent experiments . f actin was obtained following a minute polymerization of g actin in kmei buffer . to localize on actin bundles f actin was mixed with hilyte fluor labeled protein at a ratio . after minutes the sample was labeled with rhodamine phalloidin and diluted fold in _METHOD_ buffer _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ before imaging . orientation of actin filaments in _PROTEIN_ induced actin bundles was determined

size exclusion chromatography to buffer a b or c using a superdex column . sedimentation velocity auc experiments were performed in an xl i analytical ultracentrifuge at and rpm using double sector charcoal filled epon centerpieces with sapphire windows . measurements were carried out in _PROTEIN_ buffer or mm tris hcl ph mm nacl and mm mercaptoethanol or mm tris hcl ph mm nacl and mm mercaptoethanol with of each sample . absorbance scans were taken at nm every minutes for hours . the partial specific volume of was calculated from the amino acid composition to be using the program _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the sedimentation data were analyzed with program _PROTEIN_ using the continuous c distribution analysis . to analyze self association under non reducing conditions the protein was first eluted from a ni _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ then buffer exchanged by dialysis to mm mops mm nacl ph . actin was exchanged for modified g buffer _PROTEIN_ . was copolymerized with actin _PROTEIN_ .

ml of day old by cell culture were transferred into ml fresh by medium . for biolistic transformation ml of day old by cells were filtered onto a whatman filter and placed on by agar plates . particle preparation and biolistic assays were performed as previously described with the following modifications mg of gold particles prepared in glycerol were coated with of each plasmid in the presence of m

microscopy glass flow chambers of were prepared as previously described . chambers were perfused with nm nem myosin in myosin buffer . after minute the chamber was washed with myosin buffer then bsa was flowed into the chamber and incubated for minutes . the chamber was finally washed with _METHOD_ buffer . a mixture of alexa fluor labeled and unlabeled g actin with or without actin binding protein was prepared in of _METHOD_ buffer allowed to flow into the chamber and imaged immediately . actin filaments were imaged by _PROTEIN_ microscopy on a zeiss inverted microscope equipped with an alpha plan apochromat _PROTEIN_ objective . excitation ray nm was provided by an argon laser and emission light was collected with a _PROTEIN_ filter . time lapse images were acquired at second intervals over minutes with a zeiss axiocam hrm camera . typical exposure time was _METHOD_ with a laser filter of . pictures were analysed via imagej and if necessary x y drift during _PROTEIN_

representative pictures of one ratio are presented with a custom lut fire . to quantify actin bundle _PROTEIN_ we supposed that the alexa fluor _METHOD_ signal was proportional to the amount of actin present within analyzed bundles . the absolute signal of each bundle was measured and normalized to the _METHOD_ intensity of a single actin filament to obtain the number of filaments per bundle . the
