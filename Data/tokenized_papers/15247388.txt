cyclin dependent kinases control cell cycle progression through timely coordinated phosphorylation events . two kinesin like proteins that interact with cdka were identified and designated _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . they are identical and have a similar three partite domain organization . the n terminal domain contains an _PROTEIN_ and microtubule binding site typical for kinesin motors . a green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion of the n terminal domain of _PROTEIN_ decorated microtubules in bright yellow cells demonstrating microtubule binding activity . during cytokinesis the full length _METHOD_ fusion protein accumulated at the midline of young and mature expanding phragmoplasts . two hybrid analysis and coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that coiled coil structures of the central stalk were responsible for homo and heterodimerization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . by western blot analysis high molecular _METHOD_ kca molecules were detected in extracts from bright yellow cells overproducing the full length _METHOD_ fusion . treatment of these cultures with the phosphatase inhibitor vanadate caused an accumulation of these kca molecules . in addition to dimerization interactions within the c terminally located tail domain were revealed indicating that the tail could fold onto itself . the tail domains of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ contained two adjacent putative cdka phosphorylation sites one of which is conserved in kca homologs from other plant species . site directed mutagenesis of the conserved phosphorylation sites in _PROTEIN_ resulted in a reduced binding with cdka and abolished intramolecular tail interactions . the data show that phosphorylation of the cdka site provokes a conformational change in the structure of kca with implications in folding and dimerization .
we screened a cdna phage library with a partial kinesin fragment that had been isolated previously in a two hybrid screen with cdka . partial cdnas were isolated that were elongated to a putative full length cdna of bp by _PROTEIN_ pcr and designated _PROTEIN_ . recently the same fragment has been isolated in two other two hybrid screens with the geminivirus _PROTEIN_ protein and the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ subunit as baits . a second homologous cdna was isolated from the library corresponding to a gene designated _PROTEIN_ also on chromosome . the comparison of the cdna sequences with genomic dna revealed a conservation of their gene structures consisting of exons that encoded putative proteins with identity and similarity . the deduced protein sequences carried an n terminally located motor domain with the signature sequence sklslvdlagse and an _PROTEIN_ binding motif or p loop which are the most common features of kinesin motor domains . the motor domain was preceded by a short stretch of approximately amino acids that contained a coiled coil and a neck sequence carrying a conserved _PROTEIN_ motif that is confined to minus end directed kinesins . the kca proteins consisted of two additional domains a coiled coil region at the center designated stalk domain and a c terminal tail domain containing a single coiled coil a _LOCATION_ localization signal and two gly rich regions of low complexity commonly present in kinesins . the structural organization of the kca kinesins was more closely related to the tripartite structure of plus end directed kinesins that have an n terminally located motor domain . because of sequence similarity with the group of c terminal kinesins kca were tentatively classified within that group . database sequence comparison of the tail domain to other kinesins and proteins indicated that although _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were conserved in higher plant species they did not share significant homology with any other currently described protein domain . a recent phylogenetic analysis of kinesin motor domains separates _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in a distinct subclass with the minus end kinesin _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis as the closest relative . because _PROTEIN_ is potentially phosphorylated by cdka the presence of consensus cdk phosphorylation sites was searched for . the tail contained putative a type cdk phosphorylation sites at positions and in _PROTEIN_ and at positions and in _PROTEIN_ . a single spgr site in the n terminal part of the tail domain was fully conserved in kca like sequences of other species . the presence of kca mrna transcripts was analyzed in different plant organs and developmental stages by reverse transcription pcr with gene specific primers . dna fragments of the expected size corresponding to _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ transcripts were visualized after hybridization . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrna were detected in young seedlings and in log phase cell suspension cultures . _PROTEIN_ transcripts were more abundant and required a shorter film exposure to be visualized . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts was found in all the organs tested _METHOD_ and was more elevated in roots and flowers . steady state _PROTEIN_ levels were observed for the _PROTEIN_ gene which served as a loading control . to determine the transcriptional activity of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ during the course of the cell cycle an arabidopsis cell suspension culture was synchronized at _PROTEIN_ by applying aphidicolin . samples were prepared from h intervals after drug release and rna subjected to rt pcr analysis . the transcriptional levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were constant throughout the cell cycle . this is consistent with the ubiquitous _PROTEIN_ pattern revealed by immunoblot and immunolocalization by citation . the cdka binding sites of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were determined by two hybrid analysis whereby positive interactions were defined by the ability to grow on medium without his . the different _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fragments used for the analysis are presented in figure . the cdka binding sites were mapped to the head domain _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the centrally located stalk region _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the n terminal part of the tail domain _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in addition the full length _PROTEIN_ protein showed cdka binding affinity . the interaction strength of the individual peptide fragments and full length was estimated by including the competitive inhibitor aminotriazole _PROTEIN_ in the growth medium . the strongest interactions were observed with kca fragments that included the conserved cdk phosphorylation site spgr with the exception of the complete tail domain _PROTEIN_ that did not interact with cdka . these data indicate that the three separate kca domains contribute to the interaction with cdka and that the c terminal part of the tail has an inhibitory effect on the binding with cdka . the kca cdka interaction was also analyzed by coimmunoprecipitation experiments using a coupled transcription translation system in which the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fragments were tagged with c myc and cdka with hemagglutinin epitope . in the control experiment the c myc tagged peptides precipitated with a c myc monoclonal antibody confirming the correct synthesis of the kca peptide fragments . next the c myc and ha tagged translation products were mixed and pulled down with monoclonal anti ha antibodies . the _PROTEIN_ peptide fragments containing either the n terminal tail _PROTEIN_ or the head _PROTEIN_ cosedimented with ha cdka whereas the fragment containing the c terminal tail domain _PROTEIN_ did not . similar results were obtained with peptide fragments of _PROTEIN_ . the stalk _PROTEIN_ and the n terminal part of the tail _PROTEIN_ were pulled down together with ha cdka whereas the c terminal tail _PROTEIN_ was not . the results confirmed the kca and cdka interactions that had been revealed by the two hybrid analysis . none of the kca fragments was able to bind with the anti ha antibody in the absence of ha cdka . to investigate the association of _PROTEIN_ with cdka in vivo cdk protein complexes were purified from bright yellow transgenic cell cultures that produced green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged versions of the full length and fragments containing the motor _PROTEIN_ or the tail domain _PROTEIN_ . extracts of the transgenic cultures and control wild type by cells were mixed with affinity beads . crude extract pellet and supernatant were analyzed by western blot and developed with polyclonal _METHOD_ antibody . as shown in figure _METHOD_ fusion products corresponding to the predicted molecular _METHOD_ were detected in the separated crude by extracts . compared to the noninduced protein extract three kinesin related protein products were present in the preparations from dexamethasone induced cells producing the full length kinesin _METHOD_ fusion protein . the kd band corresponded to the intact _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein whereas the smallest kd protein resulted from degradation or prematurely arrested translation . the high molecular _METHOD_ band at approximately kd may represent a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ dimer . the presence of kinesin dimers in denaturing polyacrylamide gels has been reported before . pull down assays with beads indicated a strong interaction of cdka with _PROTEIN_ confirming the interaction between the full length construct and cdka in two hybrid experiments . the head also interacted with cdka whereas the tail _METHOD_ fusion did not cosediment and remained in the soluble fraction . in light of the two hybrid interaction data and the coimmunoprecipitation experiments _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to be arranged into multiple folding configurations with differential cdka binding capacities . together three cdka binding sites were revealed by these experiments one in the motor domain one in the stalk and one in the n terminal half of the tail . an important property of kinesin molecules is their ability to attach to mts either for transport or control of mt organization . to investigate the in vivo protein localization we fused _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ subdomains to the c terminal end of _METHOD_ and transformed tobacco by suspension cells . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion product _PROTEIN_ resided in the cytoplasmic space excluded from the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ . scanning of the cell periphery and center by confocal optical sectioning did not reveal specific labeling of the cortical or endosomal array indicating that the full length _METHOD_ fusion protein did not bind the interphase microtubular structures . by contrast the n terminal half of _PROTEIN_ containing the motor domain _PROTEIN_ associated with mts . cortical and endocytoplasmic mts were brightly _METHOD_ in freshly transformed calli . these observations demonstrated that the motor domain as a separate entity exhibited mt binding activity . some kinesins such as the calmodulin binding kinesin _PROTEIN_ carry a nucleotide independent mt binding site outside of their motor domain to facilitate mt sliding . therefore we analyzed the _PROTEIN_ tail domain _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ it as a _METHOD_ fusion protein in by cells . _METHOD_ was observed in the cytoplasm and in the _LOCATION_ without association with microtubular structures . surprisingly both the motor and the tail _METHOD_ fusion proteins were present in the _LOCATION_ although the motor accumulated at much higher concentrations than the tail . putative _LOCATION_ localization signals were identified in the tail domain but not in the motor . cdka also concentrates in the _LOCATION_ without a classic nls targeting signal and associates tightly with interphase chromatin . in addition it binds mts similarly to what we observed with the _METHOD_ fused _PROTEIN_ motor domain . because cdka interaction with chromatin is resistant to mild nonionic detergent extraction we performed a similar extraction procedure on by cells that produced the _METHOD_ motor or the _METHOD_ tail domains . figure d to i shows that _METHOD_ cdka and _METHOD_ motor were retained in the _LOCATION_ whereas free _METHOD_ or the _METHOD_ tail was readily and completely removed upon the detergent washes . therefore the motor protein must be tightly bound to the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ presumably as part of a protein complex that possibly also contains the cdka protein . the full length _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was followed during cell division . throughout mitosis the fusion protein remained in the cortical cytoplasm and the cytoplasmic strands and it invaded the unrestricted space of the spindle in metaphase and anaphase cells . _METHOD_ was diffuse and did not reveal fibrous structures indicating that the fusion protein did not attach to mts . once the daughter chromosomes were separated _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulated at the midline of the emerging phragmoplast where _LOCATION_ derived vesicles accumulate to form the cell plate . in a second stage of cell plate development concomitant with expansion of the phragmoplast _METHOD_ was most bright at the leading edges . reduced _METHOD_ was observed at the center of the centrifugally expanding phragmoplast where the cell plate starts to mature and mts are depolymerized . in contrast to the findings of kong and hanley bowdoin _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ did not concentrate in the _LOCATION_ nor did it associate with condensed chromosomes in metaphase cells . as the n terminal domain in front of the motor domain may be implicated in _LOCATION_ targeting or chromosome binding we analyzed the subcellular localization of a c terminal fusion of _PROTEIN_ in by cells . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was excluded from the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . in the cytoplasm it was associated with a reticulated network resembling the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . during division _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was distributed to the _PROTEIN_ sides of the spindle and the midline of the phragmoplast reminiscent to the subcellular localization of an _LOCATION_ targeted marker in by cells . several observations suggested that the kca kinesins adopt different folding configurations with distinct properties in _METHOD_ of interaction with cdka and in relation to their subcellular localization . firstly the n terminal part of the tail domain could bind cdka only when the c terminal part was not included . the inhibitory activity of the c terminal part of the tail was not evident when the full length proteins were tested indicating that these had taken on an alternative configuration immune to control by the tail domain . secondly the full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion product was excluded from the _LOCATION_ while the head and tail as separate _METHOD_ fusion fragments entered the _LOCATION_ . thirdly mts were not labeled with _METHOD_ fused to full length proteins but with the _METHOD_ head fusion product . therefore we examined the intra and intermolecular interactions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ peptides by two hybrid and immunoprecipitation assays . full length kca and peptide fragments containing the complete or part of the central coiled coil region resulted in yeast growth _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ indicating that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ could form homodimers . evidence for heterodimerization through the central coiled coil region followed from yeast growth when the stalk domains of both kinesins were tested against each other _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . two hybrid interactions were also observed between the n terminal and the c terminal halves of the tail of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pointing out that the tail domains had a tendency to fold onto _METHOD_ . a similar type of interaction also occurred between the n and c terminal tail domains of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the folding of the kca tails probably occurred via bending of two predicted hinge regions that were present in the tail domain . the tail fragment upstream of the first hinge region was essential for the interaction whereas that downstream of the second hinge did not interact in two hybrid tests indicating that the tail fragment between the two hinges was responsible for the interactions observed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the tail interactions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation assays . protein fragments containing the n terminal part of the tail of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ pulled down a _PROTEIN_ fragment containing sequences downstream of the first hinge region . we showed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ formed homo or heterodimers and that both proteins can occur in a folded conformation . in addition both proteins bind to cdka and contain cdka phosphorylation sites in the tail domain . hence we investigated whether cdka phosphorylation was implicated in kca dimerization and folding . western blot of by cells transformed with _METHOD_ fused to the full length _PROTEIN_ protein revealed two high molecular _METHOD_ bands one of which probably represents a dimeric form of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . to test the role of phosphorylation in dimer formation a phosphatase inhibitor was applied to the cells . by cells transformed with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were treated with vanadate and equal amounts of proteins of control nontreated and treated cells were loaded on a polyacrylamide gel and blotted . the concentration of the kd band increased at the expense of the kd band . these results show that phosphatase inhibition favored the formation of kca dimers . to investigate whether cdka phosphorylation could have implications for cdka binding and kca folding we introduced mutations in the putative phosphorylation sites at positions to and to in the pgbt _PROTEIN_ sequence that contains the n terminal tail of _PROTEIN_ . thr and ser were replaced by either an ala as a nonphosphorylable residue or by a glu that mimics the phosphorylated residue . we assessed the effects these changes had on the ability to interact with either cdka or with the kca tail by means of two hybrid analysis . replacement of by either an a or e had no consequences on the interaction with cdka . on the contrary substitution of the consensus sequences further downstream or with e residues disallowed the yeast strain to grow on selective medium . replacement of these residues by an a had little or no effect . these results indicated that cdka binding was sensitive to the phosphorylation status of residues and . mutational analysis in the stalk region of the _PROTEIN_ the same mutagenized _PROTEIN_ fragments were tested against the c terminal tail fragments _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the pgad vector . alteration of in either a or e had no effect on the tail interactions . however substitution of into an e residue strongly reduced the interaction with the c terminal tail regions of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ while replacement of both and completely abolished the interaction . changing these residues by an a did not alter the growth of yeast . the results suggest that phosphorylation at the consensus sequences and in _PROTEIN_ and in _PROTEIN_ influences the protein conformation that has important consequences concerning their activity .
