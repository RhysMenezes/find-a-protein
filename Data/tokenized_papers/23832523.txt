in the reference dicot plant arabidopsis thaliana the _PROTEIN_ family of p protein phosphatases includes the products of genes that have been separated into ten multi protein clades plus six singletons . clade d includes the products of nine genes distributed among three chromosomes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . as part of a functional genomics analysis of protein phosphorylation we retrieved _PROTEIN_ data from public databases and determined the subcellular protein localization of the members of clade d. while the nine proteins have been grouped together based upon primary sequence alignments we observed no obvious common patterns in _PROTEIN_ or localization . we found chimera with the _METHOD_ associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ the endomembrane system and mitochondria in transgenic plants .
based upon the tair convention used for clade b we have designated members of the arabidopsis clade d _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ preceding a _PROTEIN_ domain . sequence identity among clade members ranges between and . in order to gain some insight into the functional relevance of members of clade d we queried the _METHOD_ meta resource for absolute levels of gene _PROTEIN_ in seeds primary roots rosette leaves shoots cauline leaves flowers pollen and siliques . the level of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in pollen was much higher than the levels of any other member of clade d in any organ . the overall _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with the highest _PROTEIN_ in pollen were quite similar . in contrast _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was highest in seeds and lowest in pollen . levels of the _PROTEIN_ transcript were lowest among clade d members and were virtually restricted to leaves . the _PROTEIN_ transcript was highest in primary roots while _PROTEIN_ transcript levels varied little among organs with the exception of pollen where they were both very low . the _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were lowest among members of clade d and displayed little variation among the organs examined . knowledge of the cellular location of a _PROTEIN_ is a necessary prelude to understanding biological function . it appears however that examples of _PROTEIN_ can be found almost anywhere within the cell . in addition to the typical cytoplasmic and _LOCATION_ localization there are reports of various species of _PROTEIN_ localized to the _LOCATION_ mitochondria chloroplasts and the secretory pathway including the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ apparatus and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . results from in silico localization can provide some insight into in vivo protein localization and are useful in _METHOD_ of experimental design . we employed four different _METHOD_ to predict the localization of a. thaliana clade d _PROTEIN_ proteins . we considered a simple agreement between three of the four predictions as a consensus _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ no call _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ c/n/m/x _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ . there is a consensus mitochondrial localization predicted for _PROTEIN_ and . it is also noteworthy that all nine sequences include a potential transmembrane helix with an adjacent site for addition of a palmitoyl _LOCATION_ anchor as well as two potential bipartite nls motifs . none of the in silico results takes into account the presentation of targeting information or potential protein interactions . in the case of the _PROTEIN_ p protein phosphatases it is well established that primary sequence targeting information is subservient to sequence information within non catalytic targeting subunits . considering the overall degree of uncertainty about subcellular localization we undertook analysis of clade d _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ chimera in a. thaliana seedlings . using laser scanning confocal microscopy of translational fusions between _METHOD_ and the _PROTEIN_ clade d members _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ we examined root tips from transformed a. thaliana seedlings . the use of _METHOD_ protein chimera has become the standard in contemporary analyses of subcellular protein localization and in most instances yielded clear data for the a. thaliana clade d _PROTEIN_ proteins . when _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ alone as a control as expected the _METHOD_ signal was nucleocytoplasmic . unfortunately the green _METHOD_ signal from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was very weak and it was impossible to accurately image despite examining many independent transformants . attempts to use transient _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in a. thaliana protoplasts were also unsuccessful . we were able to obtain a _METHOD_ signal from transformed s. cerevisiae in what appears to be the mitochondrial _LOCATION_ and have used this information to tentatively assign a mitochondrial location in plants as well . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ chimera were located in a thin layer at the periphery of the root tip cells a pattern characteristic of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ associated proteins . to exclude the possibility that these proteins are actually localized in the periplasm or _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ the root cells were plasmolyzed prior to examination . in fig . c f the lower left panels are merged _METHOD_ and dic light microscopy images . the lower right panels are merged images of plasmolyzed cells with the arrows indicating the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . it is clear that the _METHOD_ signal is associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the _METHOD_ signal from root tips _PROTEIN_ either _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ indicates that these chimera were located in small _METHOD_ intracellular bodies and at the cell periphery . in both instances the _METHOD_ signal appears to be _LOCATION_ associated . our images have a punctate appearance that resembles the patterns seen with _LOCATION_ tgn or early endosome localized proteins . the _METHOD_ signal from root tips _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ had a clear co localization with the mitotracker signal . analysis of root tips from seedlings stably transformed to _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ chimera showed a _METHOD_ pattern typical for nucleocytoplasmic localization . staining with dapi confirmed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was located _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ chimera appeared to be associated with both the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the endomembrane system . images of root tips revealed the chimera associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as indicated by the thin layer at the cell periphery . a closer examination of these cells showed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is additionally associated with cellular _LOCATION_ including the tonoplast as indicated by co localization of the _METHOD_ signal with the _LOCATION_ observed in the dci image . the overall disparity between predicted and experimentally determined subcellular localization results emphasized the necessity of the latter strategy . there have been a few previous reports describing the subcellular localization of a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ proteins . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins each a member of clade a have been reported to be cytoplasmic _LOCATION_ and associated with the endomembrane system . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins both a member of clade b have been reported to be nucleocytoplasmic . in contrast _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ also members of clade b have been described as _LOCATION_ . the clade c enzymes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ located and the singleton _PROTEIN_ is _LOCATION_ . in many instances treatment with aba induced migration to the _LOCATION_ suggesting a potential role in signal transduction rather than metabolic regulation . the assignment of nine specific proteins to group d was based upon prior phylogenetic analyses plus amino acid sequence alignment . despite appearing to comprise a relatively uniform group we found substantial differences in _PROTEIN_ and subcellular localization . the possibility of functional coordination among specific kinases and phosphatases in a regulatory network has been suggested and our results indicate a degree of specialization that supports this suggestion . the exceptionally high _PROTEIN_ levels of and in pollen along with protein localization in the mitochondria and secretory pathway are a clear manifestation of specialization . while results from proteomic analyses of a. thaliana pollen have been published the occurrence of p proteins has not yet been described . there are however descriptions of the p proteome in pollen of other plants and based upon these results it would be possible to predict at least some of a. thaliana pollen p proteins . it would be informative to test these p proteins as potential clients for and . it remains to be seen how results from analysis of the remaining a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ clades will compare and contrast to the results of our study of clade d .
