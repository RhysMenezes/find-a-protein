related proteins that have two canonical cys type zinc finger motifs in their molecules are members of a family of plant transcription _PROTEIN_ . to characterize the role of this type of protein we analyzed the function of arabidopsis l. heynh . genes encoding four different related proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . gel shift analysis showed that the azfs and _PROTEIN_ bind to a t repeats within an sequence known as a target sequence of some petunia proteins . transient _PROTEIN_ analysis using synthetic green _METHOD_ protein fusion genes indicated that the azfs and _PROTEIN_ are preferentially localized to the _LOCATION_ . these four related proteins were shown to act as transcriptional repressors that down regulate the transactivation activity of other transcription _PROTEIN_ . rna gel blot analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was strongly induced by dehydration high salt and cold stresses and abscisic acid treatment . histochemical analysis of _PROTEIN_ activities driven by the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ promoters revealed that both genes are induced in leaves rather than roots of rosette plants by the stresses . transgenic arabidopsis overexpressing _PROTEIN_ showed growth retardation and tolerance to drought stress . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function as transcriptional repressors to increase stress tolerance following growth retardation .
all of the putative _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins contained a short stretch of basic amino acids near the n terminus . this region is conserved among most related proteins and might function as a potential _LOCATION_ localization signal . to investigate the _LOCATION_ localization of individual proteins we performed an in vivo targeting experiment using the synthetic green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ gene of the jellyfish aequorea victoria . the coding regions of the azf and _PROTEIN_ cdnas were fused in frame to the _METHOD_ gene and the resulting constructs were introduced into protoplasts prepared from arabidopsis cultured cells by polyethylene glycol mediated transformation . localization of each fusion protein _PROTEIN_ transiently was determined by visualization with _METHOD_ microscopy . each fusion protein was localized to the _LOCATION_ of the cells . the _LOCATION_ in the cells made visible by diamino phenylindole staining corresponded to the region of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . by contrast the control _METHOD_ without azf or _PROTEIN_ was distributed throughout the cells thus indicating that azfs and _PROTEIN_ are _LOCATION_ localized proteins . since the azfs and _PROTEIN_ contained the cys type zinc finger motif that has been identified in many transcription _PROTEIN_ as a dna binding motif we observed whether they could have dna binding ability in vitro by gel shift assay . we tested the sequence as a probe because it had already been reported that some of the petunia proteins bind to this probe in a sequence specific manner . is a bp sequence composed of two bp _PROTEIN_ sequences repeated tandemly . _PROTEIN_ was originally identified as a cis element within the pesps gene promoter in petunia . truncated azf and _PROTEIN_ proteins including two canonical zinc finger motifs were _PROTEIN_ as in frame fusion proteins with maltose binding protein in escherichia coli . all of the recombinant fusion proteins bound to the sequence . the binding activity of each fusion protein was abolished by incubation with a high concentration of edta suggesting that all four recombinant proteins might bind to directly through their zinc finger domains . to identify the target sequences within of the azf and _PROTEIN_ proteins we prepared a series of probes by substitution of two or three bases at the same position in the tandemly repeated sequences . the binding ability of each fusion protein was examined by using these base substituted probes . each protein bound to and strongly but weakly to and . three petunia related proteins and bind to two copies of the _PROTEIN_ core sequence separated by bp in the sequence . by the use of southwestern assay the wheat protein has been shown to interact with a dna fragment containing tandem copies of a cactc sequence . as the act box has the _PROTEIN_ core sequence in the reverse orientation we speculated on the importance of a t in for the binding of the azf and _PROTEIN_ proteins . the sequence contains three a t sequences two in the bp _PROTEIN_ sequence and the other at the junction of the tandem repeats . the and sequences lacked one or two of the three a t sequences . we prepared some more probes by base substitution to identify which a t is necessary in order for the azfs and _PROTEIN_ to bind to . these probes and had a substitution in one of the two parts of or . all four proteins showed similar binding specificities as each other to the base substituted fragments . all bound to the and probes in which the first and third _PROTEIN_ respectively were disrupted though the shifted bands were weaker than that of the wild type fragment . on the other hand the proteins did not bind to the probe except mbp _PROTEIN_ in which the second act was disrupted just as they did not bind to . the substitution in which did not disrupt any a t had little effect on the binding specificities of the proteins . these results indicate that the second act is most important for the binding and that the existence of either the first or the third _PROTEIN_ is necessary for the binding of the proteins to . to confirm the importance of the a t repeat sequences within for the binding of the azfs and _PROTEIN_ we used the _PROTEIN_ fusion protein and analyzed how it interacts with the fragment . retained the first _PROTEIN_ and second act but not the third act . to are the base substituted fragments of . the _PROTEIN_ and act repeats within are important for _PROTEIN_ binding because _PROTEIN_ did not bind to or . flanking sequences around the _PROTEIN_ and act are also important to _PROTEIN_ binding because the binding to and was reduced in comparison with that to . we expect that _PROTEIN_ interacts with the second act and third _PROTEIN_ of directly in a similar way as it does with the first _PROTEIN_ and second act of . these results indicate that the binding of the azf and _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins to the sequence is specific . two pairs of the a t repeats within the sequence seem to be the core target site for the azf and _PROTEIN_ proteins and sequences around the a t repeats in this fragment might have an influence on binding . to determine whether the azf and _PROTEIN_ proteins are capable of transactivating dependent transcription in plant cells we performed transient analysis using protoplasts prepared from arabidopsis leaves . protoplasts were cotransfected with a _PROTEIN_ reporter gene with or without the trimeric fragments and effector plasmids . the effector plasmids consisted of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter fused to the azf or _PROTEIN_ cdnas . coexpression of the azf and _PROTEIN_ proteins in protoplasts did not show any induction in the _PROTEIN_ of the gus reporter gene with or without the sequences . the result suggests that the azf and _PROTEIN_ proteins can not function as transcription activators in the dependent gene _PROTEIN_ . then we examined whether can function as a cis acting element in chimeric promoters by using transient analysis . to construct these promoters we used the bp and bp fragments of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ promoters respectively in addition to . both fragments are characterized as arabidopsis promoters containing positive cis and _PROTEIN_ dehydration responsive gene _PROTEIN_ . when three copies of the bp fragment of the _PROTEIN_ promoter or five copies of the bp fragment of the _PROTEIN_ promoter were directly fused to the _PROTEIN_ minimum promoter reporter activities were and times higher than that of the minimum promoter . when three copies of were inserted between these positive fragments and the minimum promoter in both the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fragments the reporter activities were negated . when three copies of were fused upstream of these positive fragments reporter activity was induced in the case of _PROTEIN_ but reduced in the case of _PROTEIN_ in comparison with the positive fragments only . these results suggest that the sequence functions as a negative cis element in arabidopsis cells . however the effect of as a negative cis element in the promoter is influenced by the position relations between other cis elements and it may be stronger when is downstream of the other positive cis element . because was shown to be a negative cis element we speculated that the azfs and _PROTEIN_ might act as transcriptional repressors mediated by binding to this element . therefore we analyzed the influences of coexpression of the azf or _PROTEIN_ proteins on transactivation of transcriptional activators . we used two different activators _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transactivate via interaction with dre and _PROTEIN_ respectively . the bp fragment of the _PROTEIN_ promoter contains one dre and the bp fragment of the _PROTEIN_ promoter contains two _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts transactivated the _PROTEIN_ of the gus reporter gene driven by dre and _PROTEIN_ about and times respectively . however reduction of transactivation activities was observed in the cells in which the azfs or _PROTEIN_ were coexpressed with these activators . in particular the proteins effectively repressed the _PROTEIN_ of the reporter gene transactivated by _PROTEIN_ . thus these results indicate that the azfs and _PROTEIN_ function as transcriptional repressors via interaction with the sequence . previously a fusion protein of _PROTEIN_ and the dna binding domain was shown to function as an active repressor of transcription and the dln box in the c terminal region was identified as a repression domain . therefore we carried out a transient analysis using _PROTEIN_ without the dln region _PROTEIN_ as an effector plasmid to show the repressive effect of the dln region of _PROTEIN_ . the transactivation activity was reduced when _PROTEIN_ was coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ but not when _PROTEIN_ was coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ patterns of the azf and _PROTEIN_ genes were analyzed under various stress conditions by using rna gel blot analysis . among the four genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ exhibited strong induction by various stresses . _PROTEIN_ of both was induced by high salt and dehydration and _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was induced also by cold . _PROTEIN_ of both was induced by aba treatment . the level of _PROTEIN_ mrna increased slowly and peaked within h with high salt dehydration and aba treatments . on the other hand the level of _PROTEIN_ mrna increased rapidly and peaked within min with high salt stress . it _PROTEIN_ by h and thereafter increased again by h. with dehydration stress and aba treatment the level of _PROTEIN_ mrna increased rapidly and peaked within min similar to that with high salt stress then it _PROTEIN_ slowly . the level of _PROTEIN_ mrna by cold treatment increased from min peaked by h and thereafter _PROTEIN_ . by contrast little _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was induced by the stresses . the _PROTEIN_ levels of these genes were weaker than those of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . we analyzed the _PROTEIN_ of azfs and _PROTEIN_ by plant hormones other than aba . _PROTEIN_ showed the strongest induction by aba and a little induction by methyl jasmonate and salicylic acid . _PROTEIN_ showed similar induction by ga methyl jasmonate salicylic acid and dichlorophenoxyacetic acid to that by aba . _PROTEIN_ of all four azf and _PROTEIN_ genes was induced by ethephon treatment . _PROTEIN_ of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was strongly induced by various stresses and aba treatment . to analyze the role of aba in the _PROTEIN_ of these two genes we used the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants of arabidopsis . the aba mutant is deficient in aba biosynthesis and the three abi mutants have an impaired response to aba . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ encode _PROTEIN_ type protein phosphatases and are thought to be essential for negative regulation of aba signaling in both vegetative tissues and seeds . _PROTEIN_ encodes a homolog of the maize vp protein and a seed specific transcription _PROTEIN_ . compared with the wild type _PROTEIN_ induction in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants was reduced by dehydration but not by nacl stress . no changes of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ between the wild type and mutant plants were observed under any stress conditions . these results suggest that a part of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ induced by dehydration is induced via the aba dependent pathway and that this aba dependent _PROTEIN_ is mediated by the _PROTEIN_ protein . however the high salt responsive _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ induced via an aba independent pathway . to study the tissue specificity of azf and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ we constructed chimeric genes consisting of the azf or _PROTEIN_ promoter regions fused to the gus reporter gene and introduced them into arabidopsis . we used a kb dna fragment for _PROTEIN_ kb for _PROTEIN_ kb for _PROTEIN_ and kb for _PROTEIN_ upstream sequences to make these chimeric gene constructs . we examined the localization of the gus reporter gene _PROTEIN_ under the control of the azf and _PROTEIN_ promoters in transgenic plants . histochemical analysis of gus activity in rosette plants revealed that all azf and _PROTEIN_ genes were commonly _PROTEIN_ in roots but at different levels in each root tissue under normal growth conditions . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was restricted to roots at a low level whereas _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was detected not only in roots but also in aerial parts . this result is in agreement with the pattern of rna gel blot analysis previously reported for _PROTEIN_ or azfs . to determine where _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is induced under stress conditions we analyzed the _PROTEIN_ of these genes in transgenic arabidopsis containing the promoter gus fusion genes . first we checked the level of induction of the gus gene driven by the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ promoters by using rna gel blot analysis . the _PROTEIN_ patterns of the gus gene under stress conditions were almost the same as those of the endogenous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes . this result _METHOD_ that both the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ promoters used here contain cis acting elements involved in stress responsive gene _PROTEIN_ . then we determined the spatial pattern of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under stress conditions by using gus staining . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were up regulated _PROTEIN_ in rosette leaves of salt treated plants . to examine the role of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in plants under stress conditions we tried to generate transgenic arabidopsis plants that constitutively overexpress _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ under the control of the camv promoter . the transformation efficiency of these plants was very low and we repeated the transformation again and again . finally we generated lines of _PROTEIN_ transformants and lines of _PROTEIN_ . transgenic plant lines overexpressing _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ were selected by rna gel blot analysis . however no _PROTEIN_ overexpressors were obtained and _PROTEIN_ was overexpressed in only two independent transgenic lines . the growth of the _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants on germination medium agar plates or on soil was compared with that of the wild type plants at or weeks respectively after sowing . both transgenic lines on both gm agar plates and soil showed growth retardation compared with the wild type plants and the level of the growth retardation was correlated with that of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the transgenic plants . to examine whether overexpression of _PROTEIN_ affects the tolerance to drought stress we grew the wild type and transgenic plants in pots for weeks and then left them unwatered for weeks . both _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines showed growth retardation but these week old soil plants did not show big difference between the wild type and _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants . we measured the soil water contents for all three lines during the drought stress experiment and found that they are not so different among three plans . almost all the wild type plants died within this week period whereas nearly all the transgenic plants of both _PROTEIN_ lines survived this level of drought stress and continued to grow when rewatered . we also tried to explore the differences in recovery after desiccation using plants grown on the agar plates . seventeen day old wild type and transgenic plants were removed from the agar plates and were kept on plastic plates for h followed by rehydration overnight . the wild type plants had wilted and crinkled leaves whereas the transgenic plants had green leaves that were spread out and appeared healthier as shown in figure . then we calculated the survival rates of the wild type and transgenic plants . only of the wild type plants survived whereas and of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ survived respectively . the leakage of electrolytes is a sensitive measure of loss of _LOCATION_ integrity and it is commonly used to assay osmolality injury . therefore we also analyzed the stress tolerance of these transgenic plants using the ion leakage test . when plants were dehydrated for h the ion leakage of the wild type plants was whereas for the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the ion leakage was about and respectively . these results indicate that both _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines clearly showed higher tolerance to drought stress than control plants .

plants were subjected to the stress treatments for various periods and then frozen in liquid nitrogen for rna gel blot analysis or stained for gus histochemical assay . the termination codon of each
