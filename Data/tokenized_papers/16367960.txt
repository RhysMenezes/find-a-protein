aureusidin synthase a polyphenol oxidase _PROTEIN_ specifically catalyzes the oxidative formation of aurones from _PROTEIN_ which are plant flavonoids and is responsible for the yellow coloration of snapdragon flowers . all known _PROTEIN_ have been found to be localized in _LOCATION_ whereas flavonoid biosynthesis is thought to take place in the cytoplasm _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . however the primary structural characteristics of aureusidin synthase and some of its molecular properties argue against localization of the enzyme in _LOCATION_ and the cytoplasm . in this study the subcellular localization of the enzyme in _PROTEIN_ cells of the yellow snapdragon was investigated . sucrose density gradient and differential centrifugation analyses suggested that the enzyme is not located in _LOCATION_ or on the _LOCATION_ . transient assays using a green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ chimera fused with the putative propeptide of the _PROTEIN_ precursor suggested that the enzyme was localized within the _LOCATION_ lumen . we also found that the necessary information for _LOCATION_ targeting of the _PROTEIN_ was encoded within the residue n terminal sequence but not in the c terminal sequence of the precursor . ntpp mediated _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ trafficking to _LOCATION_ was confirmed by means of the co _PROTEIN_ of an ntpp _METHOD_ chimera with a dominant negative mutant of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or with a monomeric red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fused _LOCATION_ marker . we identified a sequence specific _LOCATION_ sorting determinant in the ntpp of the precursor . we have demonstrated the biosynthesis of a flavonoid skeleton in _LOCATION_ . the findings of this metabolic compartmentation may provide a strategy for overcoming the biochemical instability of the precursor _PROTEIN_ in the cytoplasm thus leading to the efficient accumulation of aurones in the flower .
the subcellular localization of in the _PROTEIN_ cells of the yellow snapdragon was examined by sucrose density gradient centrifugation analysis . the organelles were separated from each other on the basis of their isopycnic densities and the correlation between the distribution of and those of organelle markers was examined by enzyme assay and western blot analysis . activity and the kda mature protein of were detected in the lowest isopycnic density fractions with good correlation with a _LOCATION_ marker . specifically the mature and its enzyme activity were not correlated with markers of _LOCATION_ and mitochondria indicating that was not localized in these organelles . in the present analysis one large and one small peak corresponding to nucleoside diphosphatase _LOCATION_ and nadph/cytochrome c reductase _LOCATION_ activities were identified . although the activity and the kda mature protein of were seemingly correlated with large peaks of these organelle markers the localization of the mature form of this _PROTEIN_ in these organelles is highly unlikely judging from the results of differential centrifugation analyses and transient assays . a western blot analysis revealed the presence of an immunopositive protein of approximately kda in fractions which appeared to correspond to small peaks of the marker activities of _LOCATION_ bodies and _LOCATION_ . this observation is consistent with the suggested intracellular trafficking of the precursor through these organelles in _PROTEIN_ cells . to further confirm that activity is not associated with the _LOCATION_ we carried out differential centrifugation analyses where the distribution of activities of and nadph cytochrome c reductase _LOCATION_ in fractions obtained by centrifugation were compared in the presence and absence of mm . inclusion of magnesium ions in the centrifugation buffer is known to prevent the dissociation of _LOCATION_ bound ribosomes resulting in an increase in the isopycnic density of the microsomes with microsome associated enzymes . the results showed that most of the nadph cytochrome c reductase activities were recovered in the and g pellets in the presence of whereas approximately of the total recovered nadph cytochrome c reductase activity was found in the g pellet in the absence of . by contrast the per cent activity of total recovered was approximately in the g supernatant irrespective of the presence or absence of . these results suggest that activity is not associated with the _LOCATION_ . to further determine whether is localized in the cytoplasm or _LOCATION_ and to examine the role of the putative ntpp and c terminal propeptide of in the subcellular localization of we constructed _PROTEIN_ vectors that encode green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ chimeras with the putative ntpp and ctpp of . the processing sites in the sequence remain to be unambiguously determined because of the possible modification of the n terminus of the purified . however the identification of tryptic peptides derived from the purified enzyme revealed that the n and c termini of the mature form should lie upstream of and downstream of _PROTEIN_ respectively in the residue precursor . thus we constructed a series of _PROTEIN_ vectors encoding _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ as well as that encoding _METHOD_ ac _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . these _METHOD_ chimeras were _PROTEIN_ in the epidermal cells of onion bulbs and the subcellular localizations of the _PROTEIN_ products were observed by means of confocal laser microscopy h after bombardment . the _PROTEIN_ cells of snapdragon were not used as the host in routine transient assays because the bombardment assays often resulted in necrosis of snapdragon _PROTEIN_ cells the large sizes of onion bulb epidermal cells permitted easier microscopic observations and it is generally accepted that intracellular sorting _METHOD_ are widely conserved among plant species . when _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ signal was consistently observed in _LOCATION_ indicating that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were exclusively localized in the _LOCATION_ lumen . in contrast when _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ ac were _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ signals appeared to be localized in the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ of the cells . in the absence of the fused ntpp or ctpp the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was also localized in the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ of the cells indicating that the observed localization of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ lumen did not arise from an autophagy process . when _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ as a control the _METHOD_ signal was found to be localized in granular organelles _LOCATION_ distributed in the cytoplasm . these results along with the results obtained from the centrifugal analyses clearly show that unlike known _PROTEIN_ that are localized in _LOCATION_ is localized in the _LOCATION_ lumen and the necessary information for the _LOCATION_ targeting of this _PROTEIN_ homolog is encoded within the residue n terminal sequence but not in the ctpp of the precursor protein . similar transient assays were also carried out using cells from _PROTEIN_ of the yellow snapdragon as host cells . in these cases chimeras of the monomeric red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ were used because the strong endogenous yellow green _METHOD_ of aurones in the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ hampered the fluorometric identification of _METHOD_ signals . the results were analogous to those obtained with onion epidermal cells . to determine whether _LOCATION_ sorting mediated by the ntpp of passes through the _LOCATION_ body _METHOD_ was co _PROTEIN_ with the wild type or a dominant negative mutant of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the subcellular localization of the _METHOD_ signal was determined . the _PROTEIN_ a plant ortholog of yeast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ specifically functions in _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ trafficking by regulating the recruitment of coatmer protein _PROTEIN_ coat complexes onto the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and promoting vesicle formation from the _LOCATION_ . it has been shown that simultaneous transient _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ causes dominant negative inhibition of protein transport from the _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ body and this should provide a useful strategy for identifying of _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ trafficking during sorting to the _LOCATION_ . the co _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ with _PROTEIN_ resulted in the localization of the _METHOD_ signal in the _LOCATION_ lumen as was observed when _METHOD_ was solely _PROTEIN_ . by contrast when _METHOD_ was co _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ a network of _METHOD_ signals was exclusively localized in the cytoplasmic space this _METHOD_ localization pattern was consistent with the localization of the cargo protein in the _LOCATION_ and was also observed when a _METHOD_ chimera with _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was co _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ . however when _METHOD_ was co _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ signals were localized in granular organelles distributed in the cytoplasm and this was also the case when this _METHOD_ chimera was co _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ . thus these results suggest that was transported from the _LOCATION_ via the _LOCATION_ body to the _LOCATION_ as is the case for most _LOCATION_ proteins in plants . the _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ trafficking governed by the ntpp of was further examined by co transformation of _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a fusion of _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ and _METHOD_ . at h after the co transformation of these constructs _METHOD_ signals were identified in the _LOCATION_ body where _METHOD_ is specifically localized whereas they were exclusively identified in the _LOCATION_ lumen h after the co transformation . these results are also consistent with the _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ trafficking of . the above findings show that the _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ resulted in the _LOCATION_ localization of the _PROTEIN_ product whereas that of _METHOD_ did not . this suggests that _LOCATION_ sorting information should at least in part be localized between and in . indeed the sequence ser leu ala of appears to satisfy the characteristics of an n terminal ssvsd in plants which is referred to as the npixl motif where the specific nature of the amino acids at the first third and fifth positions of this motif has been shown to be of particular importance for its function . to examine the functional significance of this nslay sequence in the _LOCATION_ sorting of the third and fifth positions of this sequence were replaced respectively by phe and ser and the _METHOD_ chimeras with the mutated signal sequences _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were _PROTEIN_ for use in transient assays . the replacement amino acid residues were selected on the basis of the previous observation that replacement with these residues had the most significant effects on the function of the npixl motif of the precursor of sweet potato sporamin a _LOCATION_ protein . the results showed that for both of these mutants the _PROTEIN_ product was mislocalized in the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ these single amino acid substitutions in the nslay sequence inhibited _LOCATION_ sorting _METHOD_ . it has been shown that the npixl motif of the precursor of sweet potato sporamin may also serve as a _LOCATION_ sorting signal when it is located at the c terminus of a cargo protein . to further determine whether this is also the case for the nslay motif of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ and the subcellular localization of _METHOD_ signal was monitored . the results showed that the _METHOD_ signal was localized in the _LOCATION_ lumen when _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ . moreover the _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ trafficking of _METHOD_ during its translocation to the _LOCATION_ was confirmed . thus the nslay sequence may function as an ssvsd when it is located either in the n or c terminus of a cargo protein as was observed for the npixl motif of sweet potato sporamin and barley aleurain . these results strongly suggest that the nslay sequence serves as an ssvsd which is structurally and functionally related to the npixl motif .
