triacylglycerol hydrolysis plays a pivotal role in the life cycle of many plants by providing the _PROTEIN_ skeletons and energy that drive postgerminative growth . despite the physiological importance of this process the molecular mechanism is unknown . here a genetic screen has been used to identify arabidopsis thaliana mutants that exhibit a postgerminative growth arrest phenotype which can be rescued by providing sugar . seventeen sugar dependent mutants were isolated and six represent new loci . triacylglycerol hydrolase assays showed that _PROTEIN_ and seedlings are deficient specifically in the lipase activity that is associated with purified oil bodies . map based cloning of _PROTEIN_ revealed that it encodes a protein with a patatin like acyl hydrolase domain . _PROTEIN_ shares this domain with yeast triacylglycerol lipase and human adipose triglyceride lipase . in vitro assays confirmed that recombinant _PROTEIN_ hydrolyzes triacylglycerols and diacylglycerols but not monoacylglycerols phospholipids galactolipids or cholesterol esters . _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ predominantly in developing seeds and a _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein fusion was shown to associate with the oil body surface in vivo . these data shed light on the mechanism of lipolysis in plants and establish that a central component is evolutionarily conserved among eukaryotes .
arabidopsis seeds rely on their stored oil reserves to support postgerminative growth until they achieve photosynthetic competence . mutants that fail to deposit storage oil during seed maturation or are unable to mobilize it upon germination exhibit arrested seedling growth . providing an alternative source of _PROTEIN_ such as sucrose can rescue the phenotype . here this selection strategy has been used in a forward genetic screen to isolate a collection of sdp arabidopsis mutants . approximately ethyl methanesulfonate _METHOD_ mutagenized ecotype columbia seeds were screened according to the procedure described in methods . lines that inherited an sdp phenotype but did not exhibit obvious defects in seed filling were selected for further analysis in this study . the lines are all recessive and fall into complementation groups . six of the groups represent new loci _PROTEIN_ . the remaining lines are allelic to previously characterized mutants . table contains a summary of the sdp mutant collection . arabidopsis sdp mutants to investigate whether any of the sdp mutants are deficient in tag lipase activity enzyme assays were performed on extracts from germinating seeds using emulsified triolein as a substrate . control experiments performed on wild type arabidopsis seeds show that the rate of triolein hydrolysis increases > fold after germination and that a proportion of this activity is associated with purified oil body _LOCATION_ . similar results have also been reported by citation . when extracts from the sdp mutants were assayed it was discovered that _PROTEIN_ and are defective specifically in oil body _LOCATION_ lipase activity . these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ and are likely to play an important role in tag hydrolysis . in this study _PROTEIN_ has been cloned and characterized . the _PROTEIN_ mutant is not significantly impaired in germination . however _PROTEIN_ exhibits a much slower rate of postgerminative growth than the wild type and this retarded growth is rescued by the provision of sucrose . once _PROTEIN_ seedlings develop photosynthetic activity they grow normally and are indistinguishable from the wild type throughout the rest of their life cycle . although d old _PROTEIN_ seedlings grown on sucrose appear morphologically normal both light and electron microscopy revealed that the cells retain clusters of oil bodies . by contrast essentially no oil bodies remain in wild type cotyledon cells by this stage of development . measurement of the tag content of _PROTEIN_ seeds germinated in the presence of sucrose confirmed that the mutant is severely impaired in its ability to breakdown tag . the level of tag declined by < over the course of the first d of postgerminative growth in _PROTEIN_ while in wild type seedlings it fell by . similar results were also obtained for the other _PROTEIN_ alleles . in germinating seedlings the fatty acids that are released from the oil body are activated to acyl coas before they are catabolized by peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation . measurements performed on d old _PROTEIN_ seedlings show that levels of long chain acyl coas are significantly reduced relative to the wild type . together these data support the hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ is specifically impaired in storage oil hydrolysis . enzyme assays performed on extracts from germinating _PROTEIN_ seedlings also suggest that despite the reduced availability of substrate in vivo the enzymic capacity of fatty acid oxidation the glyoxylate cycle and _PROTEIN_ are not reduced . high resolution mapping was used to locate the _PROTEIN_ locus . the _PROTEIN_ mutant was outcrossed to wild type ecotype landsberg _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ lines selected from the progeny . pcr based polymorphic markers were then used to localize _PROTEIN_ to an kb region on the north arm of chromosome situated between markers _PROTEIN_ and . this region contains four genes . the genomic sequence of each candidate was sequenced from three _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ alleles and point mutations were found in the coding region of _GENE_ . in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants point mutations lead to single amino acid substitutions in the protein _PROTEIN_ . two null alleles of _PROTEIN_ were also obtained from t dna _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ alleles contain single t dnas inserted in the first exon of _GENE_ and both exhibit the same phenotype as the _METHOD_ alleles . a full length cdna encoding _GENE_ has previously been isolated by the _PROTEIN_ consortium . the _PROTEIN_ polypeptide is amino acid residues long and has a calculated molecular _METHOD_ of kd . querying the national center for biotechnology information conserved domain database revealed that the sequence contains a predicted patatin like domain between amino acid residues and . patatin is an abundant storage protein from potato tubers that is known to exhibit lipolytic activity . patatin is classified as a phospholipase type and _METHOD_ the prototype for a calcium independent phospholipase subfamily with many members . the patatin like domain of _PROTEIN_ has a conserved ser esterase motif but lacks the nucleotide and asp active site signatures that are generally considered to be characteristic of the class . although patatin can hydrolyze a variety of substrates in vitro it is not active against tag . however patatin like proteins from yeast and animals have recently been discovered which have bona fide tag lipase activity . triacylglycerol lipase and are involved in oil breakdown in saccharomyces cerevisiae and adipose triglyceride lipase _PROTEIN_ and brummer lipase are necessary for fat hydrolysis in humans and drosophila melanogaster respectively . interestingly beyond the patatin like domain very little sequence similarity exists between the yeast and animal lipases . arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ is most closely related to the family of three yeast lipases although the overall level of amino acid sequence similarity is relatively small . including _PROTEIN_ there are proteins with a predicted patatin like domain in arabidopsis . of these proteins only _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ shares significant sequence similarity with _PROTEIN_ . interestingly arabidopsis also contains a single patatin like protein that shares amino acid similarity with _PROTEIN_ and brummer . a blast search of the publicly available sequence databases showed that _PROTEIN_ homologues are distributed widely in plants . for example the monocot oryza sativa the legume medicago truncatula and the moss physcomitrella patens all contain proteins that share > amino acid identity with _PROTEIN_ . to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ has tag lipase activity a tagged recombinant version of the protein was _PROTEIN_ in s. cerevisiae under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter and purified using nickel chelating resin . in vitro assays showed that can hydrolyze triolein readily with a specific activity of protein under the conditions used in this study . the rate of hydrolysis was proportional to the amount of protein and also to the amount of emulsified substrate up to mg . when the ph of the assay medium was varied was found to have a broad optimum around ph . to further characterize its activity was tested against a variety of substrates . could hydrolyze tags containing long and medium chain saturated fatty acids and long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids . the enzyme was much less active on dag and could not hydrolyze mag . the selectivity of for tag was supported by analysis of the products of triolein hydrolysis . the major products were oleic acid and diolein . relatively little monoolein was produced . was unable to hydrolyze a representative phospholipid a galactolipid a sterol ester an acyl coa or an artificial ester . substrate specificity of and effect of inhibitors the effect of known inhibitors of lipases was investigated using triolein as a substrate . the activity of was sensitive to preincubation with the classical ser esterase inhibitors diethyl p nitrophenyl phosphate and diisopropyl fluorophosphate . the mechanism based inhibitor tetrahydropyran one also inhibited activity at submicromolar concentrations . these data lend experimental evidence to suggest that _PROTEIN_ uses the same catalytic mechanism as patatin . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was investigated by searching the publicly available microarray database using genevestigator . this search suggested that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ almost exclusively in _PROTEIN_ seed development a pattern that is more normally associated with genes involved in storage reserve synthesis rather than breakdown . more detailed analysis using real time pcr confirmed that _PROTEIN_ transcript abundance increases at the beginning of seed maturation when oil is actively being deposited and remains high right up until seed desiccation is completed . _PROTEIN_ mrna levels are also high early in seed imbibition but they decline as the seed germinates and remain relatively low throughout postgerminative growth when oil catabolism is most active . the _PROTEIN_ that oil body _LOCATION_ from germinating _PROTEIN_ seeds are deficient in lipase activity strongly suggests that _PROTEIN_ is an oil body associated protein . to investigate the subcellular location of _PROTEIN_ in vivo an _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion was transiently _PROTEIN_ in d old _PROTEIN_ seedlings under the control of the promoter . confocal microscopy showed that in living cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ associates with the surface of oil bodies . fractionation of a seedling homogenate by centrifugation confirmed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is predominantly localized to the oil body fraction and lipase assays performed on purified oil body _LOCATION_ also showed that the fusion protein is catalytically active .
