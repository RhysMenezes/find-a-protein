assembly of stable light harvesting complexes in the chloroplast of green algae and plants requires synthesis of chlorophyll b a reaction that involves oxygenation of the methyl group of chl a to a formyl group . this reaction uses molecular oxygen and is catalyzed by chlorophyllide a oxygenase _PROTEIN_ . the amino acid sequence of _PROTEIN_ predicts mononuclear iron and rieske iron sulfur centers in the protein . the mechanism of synthesis of chl b and localization of this reaction in the chloroplast are essential steps toward understanding lhc assembly . _METHOD_ of a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein transiently _PROTEIN_ in young pea leaves was found at the periphery of mature chloroplasts and on _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ by confocal _METHOD_ microscopy . however when _LOCATION_ from partially degreened cells of chlamydomonas reinhardtii were resolved on sucrose gradients full length _PROTEIN_ was detected by immunoblot analysis only on the chloroplast envelope inner _LOCATION_ . the electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum of _PROTEIN_ included a resonance at g assigned to the predicted mononuclear iron center . instead of a spectrum of the predicted rieske iron sulfur center a nearly symmetrical approximately gauss peak to trough signal was observed at g with a sensitivity to temperature characteristic of an iron sulfur center . a remarkably stable radical in the protein was revealed by an isotropic gauss peak to trough signal at g . fragmentation of the protein after incorporation of identified a conserved tyrosine residue as the radical species . the radical was quenched by chlorophyll a an indication that it may be involved in the enzymatic reaction . _PROTEIN_ was found on the chloroplast envelope and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in mature chloroplasts but only on the envelope inner _LOCATION_ in dark grown c. reinhardtii cells . such localization provides further support for the envelope _LOCATION_ as the initial site of chl b synthesis and assembly of lhcs during chloroplast development . identification of a tyrosine radical in the protein provides insight into the mechanism of chl b synthesis .
to determine localization of _PROTEIN_ in chloroplasts leaves of young pea plants were biolistically transformed with the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence fused in frame at the end to the coding sequence of _METHOD_ . twenty four hours after transient _PROTEIN_ from the promoter green _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ was localized quantitatively to chloroplasts and appeared throughout the chloroplast including _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ which were indicated by red _METHOD_ of chl . as shown by the overlay in figure direct correspondence of green and red _METHOD_ was not found . particularly at the periphery of the _LOCATION_ the green _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ seemed predominant while the _METHOD_ of chl was predominant within the chloroplast . this experiment indicated that _PROTEIN_ was located on envelope and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in developed chloroplasts although the relative enrichment seemed greater in the envelope as compared with _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to localize _PROTEIN_ by a biochemical approach homogenized arabidopsis leaves or broken chlamydomonas cells were centrifuged to separate _LOCATION_ and soluble proteins . immunoblot analysis after electrophoresis of proteins in these cell fractions showed that _PROTEIN_ was recovered quantitatively with _LOCATION_ and was not released when _LOCATION_ were washed with m nacl . _LOCATION_ from cells of c. reinhardtii were resolved on sucrose gradients followed by immunoblot analysis after electrophoresis of proteins in fractions from the gradients . _PROTEIN_ was recovered in _LOCATION_ with buoyant densities characteristic of envelope _LOCATION_ and in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ consistent with results shown in figure . because we found previously that the _LOCATION_ marker lhcp was detected in the low density region of the gradient _PROTEIN_ regions containing envelope were possibly contaminated with _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . thus advantage was taken of the ability to grow c. reinhardtii cells in the dark to reduce the amount of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and determine more clearly whether _PROTEIN_ is present in envelope _LOCATION_ . when samples from cells grown in the dark for days were applied to sucrose gradients a yellow slightly turbid band with a density typical of the inner envelope _LOCATION_ was resolved in the middle of the gradient . the only immunoreactive polypeptide detected in these fractions with antiserum against _PROTEIN_ was kda in _METHOD_ the size predicted for the _PROTEIN_ gene product _PROTEIN_ . these immunoreactive _LOCATION_ were clearly separated from residual _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ indicated by their content of chl and by immunostaining with antibodies against lhcp which were recovered in fractions . intact _PROTEIN_ was not detected in these latter fractions . a low level of mature sized lhcp was detected in the mid region and also near the top of the gradient at a buoyant density of envelope outer _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . previous work _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed by immunoelectron microscopy that lhcps were incorporated initially into _LOCATION_ of the envelope during chloroplast development assembled into lhcs and then transferred to their major site of accumulation the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . these results are similar to the small amount of mature sized lhcp recovered with purified envelope _LOCATION_ by bovet et al . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which was phosphorylated by a _LOCATION_ bound kinase and may represent lhcp transiently associated with the envelope during import . _PROTEIN_ of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ cdna was induced in e. coli at to maximize recovery of correctly folded enzyme _PROTEIN_ . the initial epr spectrum of a _LOCATION_ fraction measured at k revealed the presence of several distinct paramagnetic species . a narrow signal at g was assigned to high spin non heme in a near maximally rhombic environment . a sextet of small peaks in the region between and gauss was attributed to a low level of contaminating . in subsequent experiments the signals were eliminated by a wash of _LOCATION_ with mm edta . although the g signal often results from adventitious this signal was not diminished significantly by the wash with edta nor was the signal _PROTEIN_ by addition of reductants such as dithiothreitol or ascorbate which should reduce free iron to the epr silent . thus the g signal appeared to indicate assembly of the predicted mononuclear iron center which was possibly protected from the environment or stabilized by the surrounding protein structure . _LOCATION_ the most striking feature of the spectrum was a signal at g characteristic of an organic radical species . addition of chl a to the sample quenched the radical which suggested that the radical species resided in _PROTEIN_ and is likely involved in catalytic activity . the isotropic feature of the radical spectrum with a gauss peak to trough linewidth is shown on an expanded scale in figure for a sample washed with mm edta . free radical species are present in e. coli _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and thus it was important to achieve sufficient over _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ to facilitate analysis of the epr spectrum of _PROTEIN_ without interference from endogenous signals . we observed an endogenous radical in the spectrum of _LOCATION_ samples from uninduced e. coli cells that was approximately equal in amplitude to a strong endogenous high spin signal at g possibly from a cytochrome _PROTEIN_ . the g signal and by implication that from the endogenous radical was below detection in samples of over _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . electrophoresis of samples used for epr spectroscopy revealed a kda polypeptide the _METHOD_ expected of the recombinant _PROTEIN_ that was prominent in fractions from cells in which _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was induced but absent in samples from uninduced cells . when the temperature at which epr spectra were measured was lowered below k a broad signal appeared at g . the nearly symmetrical nature of this signal with a peak to trough linewidth of about gauss is shown in figure after addition of chl to quench the radical . this signal weakened dramatically as the temperature was increased above k . interestingly the addition of reducing agents such as dithiothreitol or dithionite to the ambient oxidized samples did not significantly affect the intensity of this signal . however the signal disappeared after addition of mercaptoethanol . we have no obvious explanation for the differing effects of reducing agents other than the possibility that the epr active center was more accessible to the smaller less _PROTEIN_ mercaptoethanol . although the shape and position of this signal is similar to the epr spectrum of _PROTEIN_ its sensitivity to temperature and resistance to reductants except for mercaptoethanol did not support this assignment . the large stability constant of with edta also argues against the metal being retained after the sample was washed with edta . to determine whether the spectrum of the recombinant protein was the same as the native enzyme proteins were obtained by immunoprecipitation with antiserum raised against a c terminal fragment of _PROTEIN_ . this region of the protein was selected as antigen to avoid cross reaction with other redox active proteins that contain conserved rieske or mononuclear iron domains . the epr spectrum of _PROTEIN_ recovered from detergent solubilized extracts from arabidopsis leaves was similar to that obtained with the recombinant protein . strong signals were found at g for the mononuclear iron center and at g which overlapped the spectrum of the radical . we did not detect a signal predicted for a rieske iron sulfur center up field from the radical spectrum after addition of dithionite or ascorbate . the spectrum was not significantly different in shape when the microwave power used for the measurement was raised from mw to mw at k . immunoprecipitated _PROTEIN_ from c. reinhardtii cells provided a spectrum similar to that obtained with the sample from arabidopsis . preparations from chlamydomonas cells were often contaminated with but as illustrated in figure samples washed with mm edta prior to the analysis lacked signals . the treatment with edta did not significantly affect the magnitude of the g signal which indicated that the latter did not arise from contaminating . iron has a slightly higher stability constant with edta than manganese which supports this treatment as an appropriate control for adventitious transition metals . furthermore these samples were prepared from detergent solubilized _LOCATION_ which should preclude simply trapping iron within a _LOCATION_ pellet . a control sample prepared with preimmune serum and washed with mm edta lacked the radical spectrum at g and the g signal . the preimmune control in some experiments contained a low amplitude signal that overlapped the g signal but the background structure did not match the peak to trough positions of signals in the immunopurified _PROTEIN_ nor was it present in other samples . analysis of immunoprecipitates from chlamydomonas by electrophoresis revealed the heavy and light chains of igg and three additional polypeptides between kda and kda in _METHOD_ . these polypeptides were possibly functionally associated with the enzyme but did not react with antibodies against _PROTEIN_ . preliminary evidence obtained by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of tryptic fragments provided a tentative identification of the kda component as a thioredoxin while the analysis suggested that the kda polypeptide was a minor lhcb . _PROTEIN_ migrated near the heavy chain of igg . the isotropic g signal indicated the existence of a stable radical in the protein characteristic of the phenolate radical of tyrosine . to confirm that the radical occurred on an amino acid residue _LOCATION_ fractions from e. coli arabidopsis and chlamydomonas were incubated with which was reported to react specifically with tyrosine radicals and the proteins were resolved by electrophoresis . radioautographic analysis of the dried gel revealed labeling of a protein kda in _LOCATION_ from chlamydomonas and kda from arabidopsis _LOCATION_ . other proteins also became labeled in particular a kda protein probably the reaction center protein whose tyrosine radical is known to react with iodide . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in e. coli either as the crude _LOCATION_ sample or after purification migrated as a kda polypeptide . from n terminal sequence analysis the terminal two amino acids were derived from the vector which were followed by the _PROTEIN_ sequence starting at lys . the smaller labeled polypeptide in lane kda in _METHOD_ was a c terminal fragment of _PROTEIN_ beginning at pro . this fragment possibly resulted from a trypsin like cleavage at lys and removal of the subsequent n terminal met . the n terminal sequences of the other two major polypeptides in figure lane kda and kda in _METHOD_ corresponded to the abundant porins ompc and ompa respectively which were not significantly labeled . recovery of radioactivity with the protein after electrophoresis indicated that the radical species was associated with the protein and not a cofactor . the labeled amino acid was identified based on its position relative to a lys or arg residue . a tyrosine residue occurs in of the first positions downstream of these trypsin cleavage sites . _PROTEIN_ from dark grown c. reinhardtii cells was immunopurified and labeled . the sample was digested with trypsin and the mixture was subjected to successive cycles of n terminal degradation . most of the radioactivity was released in cycle . the amount of radioactivity in cycle was likely the result of incomplete transfer of the sample from the reaction vial to the fraction collector . essentially the same result was obtained with _PROTEIN_ prepared from light grown cells . only tyr in _PROTEIN_ from c. reinhardtii should be n terminal after trypsin digestion . similar results were obtained with immunopurified _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis with tyr as the corresponding residue . when the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in e. coli was analyzed data similar to those in figure were obtained . the low levels of radioactivity released in remaining cycles indicated that labeling with was highly specific and digestion with trypsin was essentially complete .
