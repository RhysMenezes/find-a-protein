vitamin is an essential metabolite in all _METHOD_ . it can act as a coenzyme for numerous metabolic enzymes and has recently been shown to be a potent antioxidant . plants and _METHOD_ have a de novo biosynthetic pathway for vitamin but animals must obtain it from dietary sources . in escherichia coli it is known that the vitamin is derived from deoxyxylulose phosphate and phosphohydroxy l threonine . it has been assumed that vitamin is synthesized in the same way in plants but this hypothesis has never been experimentally proven . here we show that in plants synthesis of the vitamin takes an entirely different route which does not involve deoxyxylulose phosphate but instead utilizes intermediates from the pentose phosphate pathway i.e. ribose phosphate or ribulose phosphate and from glycolysis i.e. dihydroxyacetone phosphate or glyceraldehyde phosphate . the revelation is based on the recent discovery that in bacteria and fungi a novel pathway is in place that involves two genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ neither of which is homologous to any of those involved in the previously doctrined e. coli pathway . we demonstrate that arabidopsis thaliana has two functional homologs of _PROTEIN_ and a single homolog of _PROTEIN_ . furthermore and contrary to what was inferred previously we show that the pathway appears to be _LOCATION_ and is not localized to the _LOCATION_ . last we report that the single _PROTEIN_ homolog is essential for plant viability .
identification and functional characterization of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes . using blast with the c. nicotianae _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ sequences as queries three genes encoding putative _PROTEIN_ and a single gene encoding a putative _PROTEIN_ were identified in the completely sequenced genome of arabidopsis . for ease of reference we propose to name the _PROTEIN_ homologs _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively whereas the homolog of _PROTEIN_ will be referred to as _PROTEIN_ . an alignment of the hypothetical a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ protein sequences _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ together with those from the fungi c. nicotianae _PROTEIN_ and s. cerevisiae _PROTEIN_ shows an extremely high degree of conserved sequence throughout the entire length of the genes . whereas _PROTEIN_ is not as strongly conserved as those of the other a. thaliana homologs it also does not have the complete sequence lpvvnfaaggvatpadaal a characteristic of this protein family . an amino acid sequence alignment of _PROTEIN_ also shows a high degree of sequence identity between the plant and fungal homologs with almost the entire signature sequence of this protein family _PROTEIN_ being retained . importantly the characteristic catalytic triad of class i glutamine amidotransferases which consists of a cysteine histidine and glutamate residue in the glutaminase domain is conserved in _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ sequence tags can be found for all of these genes in a variety of tissues . moreover total rna isolation and real time rt pcr by using specific primers confirmed that all genes are _PROTEIN_ . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ encode functional enzymes the genes were cloned into a yeast _PROTEIN_ vector under the control of a tetracycline regulatable promoter system and were tested for their ability to complement the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ disruption mutants and respectively from s. cerevisiae . when grown in minimal medium in the absence of vitamin these mutants have a growth defect that is most pronounced in . complementation of and with the s. cerevisiae _PROTEIN_ and genes respectively served as positive controls . in the absence of vitamin the mutant transformed with either arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ grew significantly faster than the strain transformed with the empty vector suggesting that these plant homologs can restore vitamin prototrophy in yeast . on the other hand _PROTEIN_ did not restore prototrophy . the mutant transformed with _PROTEIN_ showed enhanced growth in comparison to that of cells carrying the empty vector indicating functional homology of the two genes . when pyridoxine was included in the medium all strains grew equally well . subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . no clear targeting sequence could be identified in _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ from an in silico analysis . we therefore investigated the subcellular location of each of the proteins in vivo by fusing each one to the n terminus of _METHOD_ employing the vector such that the fusions were under control of the promoter . we noted an extension at the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ when compared with homologous sequences of nonplant origin and therefore also investigated a c terminal _METHOD_ fusion construct by using the vector . each construct was introduced into onion epidermal cells and protoplasts of arabidopsis mesophyll cells by particle gun bombardment and polyethylene glycol mediated chemical transformation respectively . the subcellular location of the transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins was viewed by confocal microscopy . as expected in the case of _METHOD_ alone a diffuse _METHOD_ pattern typical of a _LOCATION_ location was found in both the onion epidermal cells and arabidopsis protoplasts with a tendency to accumulate in the nucleoplasm . all three _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions and both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ exhibited a similar localization pattern implying that they are _LOCATION_ . it is clear from the arabidopsis protoplast green _METHOD_ that there is no overlap with the chlorophyll _METHOD_ nor did we observe a punctuate pattern typical of mitochondrial or microbody targeting in either the nonphotosynthetic or photosynthetic tissue types . western blot analyses of the transfected protoplasts by using a _METHOD_ antibody revealed that all of the fusion proteins remained intact . vitamin biosynthesis in plants occurs independent of deoxyxylulose phosphate . it is generally assumed in the literature that deoxyxylulose phosphate and phosphohydroxy l threonine are the precursors for the formation of vitamin in plants . although it is well established that dxp is a precursor for the biosynthesis of isoprenoids through the nonmevalonate pathway in prokaryotes and plants its role in vitamin biosynthesis has merely been inferred from extrapolation of the pathway as it occurs in e. coli . there is only a single very preliminary report in the literature that _METHOD_ that dx was used to form vitamin in spinach chloroplasts but no proof of the nature of the reaction product was provided . using a microbiological assay we measured the vitamin content in the arabidopsis cla mutant . _PROTEIN_ encodes deoxyxylulose phosphate synthase _PROTEIN_ . although the vitamin content of the cla mutant plants is somewhat reduced compared with that of wild type plants it is clear that vitamin biosynthesis can still occur in the absence of this protein . in addition the percentage of cla seeds that germinate in the absence of exogenous vitamin is almost identical to that of the wild type . however two additional genes closely related to _PROTEIN_ exist in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which may encode dxp synthase but have not yet been functionally analyzed . thus the plants were treated with clomazone an agent that has been shown to specifically inhibit dxp synthase . a slight _PROTEIN_ comparable with that in the cla mutant plants was observed in the vitamin content . the observed _PROTEIN_ in vitamin could indeed indicate that there are two routes functioning in its biosynthesis in plants . however an analysis of the available genomes has shown that there are no genes homologous to either pdxa or pdxj which catalyze formation of the pyridoxine _PROTEIN_ in e. coli from dxp and phosphohydroxy l threonine in plants _METHOD_ arguing against the utilization of dxp in vitamin biosynthesis . this conclusion is corroborated by the observation of e. leistner 's group referred to in ref . citation that isotopically labeled dx or dxp was not incorporated into the vitamin derivative o methylpyridoxine in g. biloba . an explanation for the observed _PROTEIN_ in vitamin can thus be that inhibition of dxp synthase depletes tissue of a metabolite that may positively regulate a key protein participating in the dxp independent route . on the other hand blocking the second enzyme in the nonmevalonate isoprenoid pathway i.e. dxp reductoisomerase would be expected to result in a buildup of dxp and hence vitamin . when wild type plants were treated with fosmidomycin which specifically inhibits dxp reductoisomerase no significant effect on the vitamin content was observed . functionality of both clomazone and fosmidomycin as inhibitors under the conditions used was indicated by the bleaching phenotype observed after h . this data indicates that vitamin biosynthesis occurs in plants independent of dxp . a pathway of vitamin biosynthesis in plants . in yeast the nonmevalonate pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis does not exist . moreover the extensive studies of spenser and colleagues indicate that in yeast vitamin biosynthesis proceeds by a route distinct from that in e. coli in that a pentose which is not dxp and a triose are the sugar precursors for formation of the vitamin in this organism . in the bacterial model it has recently been established by burns et al . and indeed by our own independent studies that yaad _PROTEIN_ can accept either ribose phosphate or ribulose phosphate as the pentose sugar and either dihydroxyacetone phosphate or glyceraldehyde phosphate as the triose sugar to form vitamin in the presence of yaae _PROTEIN_ and glutamine . here we demonstrate the reconstitution of vitamin biosynthesis from a higher plant . recombinant _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are able to catalyze the formation of the vitamin from either one of the above mentioned pentose or triose sugars in the presence of ammonium sulfate as the nitrogen source and without addition of _PROTEIN_ . no reaction was observed with glutamine under these conditions . although the rate observed is substantially higher with ribose phosphate and glyceraldehyde phosphate in the presence of either _PROTEIN_ protein than with the other sugar molecules _PROTEIN_ appears to have a greater ability to accept dihydroxyacetone phosphate than _PROTEIN_ . thus far we have not been successful in isolating a functional recombinant version of _PROTEIN_ based on the measurement of its ability to hydrolyze glutamine but once achieved the influence of _PROTEIN_ on _PROTEIN_ activity will be examined . no activity was observed with _PROTEIN_ under any of these conditions indicating that it is not a functional homolog . uv visible spectrophotometric analysis of the reaction product by treatment with sodium borohydride or sodium hydroxide results in shifts in the absorption maxima that are characteristic of pyridoxal phosphate _PROTEIN_ . the identity of the reaction product under all conditions was confirmed by a hplc analysis with commercially available standards _PROTEIN_ and always resulted in coelution with pyridoxal phosphate . furthermore the reaction product was dephosphorylated and submitted to electron impact _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . although the molecular ion observed agrees very well with the calculated _METHOD_ of the compound fragment _METHOD_ corresponding to the loss of and the consecutive loss of the aldehyde group characteristic of pyridoxal can be clearly observed . because the reaction product of the functional _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ it can be concluded that the alternative vitamin pathway observed in bacteria is also in operation in plants . _PROTEIN_ is essential for plant viability . because _PROTEIN_ is a single copy gene various collections of t dna and transposon insertion mutants available were searched for a disruption in _GENE_ two of which are described here . is a t dna insertion line whereas is a transposon tagged line from _PROTEIN_ gsc envisaged to have one insertion in the gene . in the case of genomic dna blots revealed a complex insertion of three t dna 's at the same locus . pcr analysis and sequencing established that the disruption in both lines occurs in the first intron as indicated in fig ref . for convenience we will name these insertion alleles _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . based on a pcr analysis no homozygous plants could be identified in either the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ collection of seeds suggesting that seed development is impaired . a comparison of wild type siliques with those of heterozygous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ revealed that the heterozygous plants consistently had a population of albino seeds . a statistical analysis of the heterozygous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seeds revealed that showed the albino phenotype thereby representing the homozygous population . as the albino phenotype could be either due to the loss of pigment or developmental arrest a histological analysis was carried out . in cleared whole mount specimens _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seeds were developmentally delayed compared with their wild type or heterozygous siblings . the developmental arrest in all seeds analyzed occurred at the globular stage of embryo development . progress to the heart stage was never observed in _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ even though they were monitored from the globular to the cotyledon stage of embryo development . as far as could be judged the heterozygous plants developed normally from seedling stage to maturity . the arrest in development observed in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ can be explained by the assumption that during the early stages of embryogenesis the surrounding maternal tissues supply vitamin among other nutrients but that the globular to heart transition may be a critical stage in the conversion from heterotrophy to autotrophy . in this context many of the metabolic enzymes likely to be required at this stage have pyridoxal phosphate as an essential cofactor e.g. tryptophan synthase and ornithine decarboxylase involved in tryptophan and spermine and spermidine biosynthesis respectively to name but two . it is noted that an allele of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ has also been described in the seedgenes database where it is reported that a t dna insertion in exon of _GENE_ results in arrest of embryo development . we have now initialized experiments to rescue the homozygous phenotype by enriching complete _METHOD_ growth medium with vitamin . however it is notoriously difficult to rescue embryos arrested at such an early stage of development and may rely on the generation of embryos that can at least reach the globular to heart stage transition . concluding remarks . in this report we show that contrary to what is generally tacitly assumed vitamin biosynthesis in plants does not appear to depend on dxp . instead the vitamin is synthesized from the pentose phosphate pathway intermediates ribose phosphate or ribulose phosphate and either glyceraldehyde phosphate or dihydroxyacetone phosphate . moreover it appears that this pathway is _LOCATION_ rather than _LOCATION_ as was inferred in ref . citation . of the genes that characterize this previously undescribed pathway two functional homologs of _PROTEIN_ and a single copy of _PROTEIN_ are found in arabidopsis the latter is essential for plant viability . to summarize light has been shed onto how this essential vitamin can be synthesized in plants .
