a direct interaction of the arabidopsis thaliana immunophilin _PROTEIN_ with phosphatidylinositol phosphate and phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate was identified using a phosphatidylinositol phosphate affinity chromatography of cell suspension extracts combined with a _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis . the first _PROTEIN_ binding domain was shown sufficient to bind to both phosphatidylinositol phosphate stereoisomers . _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ under the control of a promoter was localised in the cytoplasm and the cell periphery of nicotiana tabacum leaf explants . _METHOD_ microscopy of arabidopsis thaliana root tips verified its cytoplasmic localization and _LOCATION_ association and showed _PROTEIN_ localization in the elongation zone which was expanded to the meristematic zone in plants grown on high salt media . endogenous _PROTEIN_ was shown to accumulate in response to high salt treatment in arabidopsis thaliana young leaves as well as in seedlings germinated on high salt media at both an mrna and protein level . plants over _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ exhibited enhanced germination under salinity stress which was significantly reduced in the _PROTEIN_ knock out mutants and abolished in the double mutants of _PROTEIN_ and of its interacting homologue _PROTEIN_ . our results show that _PROTEIN_ plays an important role in the osmotic/salt stress responses of germinating arabidopsis thaliana seedlings and suggest its involvement in salinity stress responses through a phosphatidylinositol phosphate related protein quality control pathway .
a _PROTEIN_ chromatography was employed in order to identify _PROTEIN_ p and _PROTEIN_ binding candidates from a. thaliana cell suspension cultures . a cell suspension culture treated with either or nacl for mins was centrifuged cell pellet was collected and homogenized and extracts were first incubated with a positively and a negatively charged ion exchange chromatography in order to reduce sample complexity . sequential washings using different salt concentrations resulted in fractions which in turn were incubated with the _PROTEIN_ chromatography . a band close to kd apparent molecular weight appeared enriched in the _PROTEIN_ incubation of several q and s fractions . salt stress for mins resulted in its enrichment in both the _PROTEIN_ p and _PROTEIN_ incubations of the m q fraction . band excision from both lanes of the _PROTEIN_ p and _PROTEIN_ incubation of the salt stressed cultures followed by nanolc esi _METHOD_ identified the peptidyl prolyl cis trans isomerases _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ p peptides used with probability and mascot score for _PROTEIN_ peptides used with probability and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ peptides used with probability . fraction of a. thaliana extract incubated with the _PROTEIN_ p and _PROTEIN_ columns . fraction incubated with _PROTEIN_ p _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ columns . _PROTEIN_ collected after sequential incubation with a q followed by an s column and applied to a _PROTEIN_ p and _PROTEIN_ affinity chromatography . incubation of a fraction obtained from extracts of m or m nacl treated culture cells with _PROTEIN_ p and _PROTEIN_ columns . arrows indicate an enriched band in the _PROTEIN_ incubation as well as its accumulation in both the _PROTEIN_ p and _PROTEIN_ incubations following salt stress of the a. thaliana cell culture . _PROTEIN_ is a multi domain protein . _PROTEIN_ contains an _PROTEIN_ binding domain _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ activity _PROTEIN_ two degenerate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as well as tetratricopeptide repeat domains and a potential calmodulin binding domain . the pdb structure of the structural homologue of the _PROTEIN_ spectrin was obtained known for binding to the i and the residues binding to the i were identified . in particular the structural studies have indicated that spectrin specifically interacts with i at and . also the structures of the _PROTEIN_ domains of _PROTEIN_ were obtained and aligned to spectrin . domain organization of _PROTEIN_ . black shaded boxes indicate low complexity regions . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ truncated mutants used in _PROTEIN_ his fusions for protein overexpression . _PROTEIN_ truncated _PROTEIN_ missing the first aminoacids of the protein . tkfd truncated _PROTEIN_ missing the low complexity region part of the _PROTEIN_ and the polylysine motif . truncated _PROTEIN_ missing the n terminus sequence containing both the polylysin and the dssrdr motives . also see . structural alignment of spectrin and the _PROTEIN_ domain of _PROTEIN_ using _PROTEIN_ pair wise comparison and indicated possible binding sites for a phosphorylated inositol _PROTEIN_ on the _PROTEIN_ domain of _PROTEIN_ involving the dssrdr region . _PROTEIN_ and its truncated mutants were over _PROTEIN_ with an n terminal _PROTEIN_ tag and c terminal his tag following transformation of a bacterial cell line with the palex vector used for their cloning . following double purification using glutathione and nickel columns _PROTEIN_ and its truncated mutants were eluted and used in a lipid overlay assay . _PROTEIN_ specifically associated with both the _PROTEIN_ p as well as with the _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ domain was shown sufficient for _PROTEIN_ binding and appeared to possess a higher affinity for the _PROTEIN_ stereoisomer and reduced affinity for the _PROTEIN_ p . a competition assay using the two stereoisomers as competing lipids produced a specific reduction in the case of the _PROTEIN_ however an addition of _PROTEIN_ p as a competing lipid reduced signal for both the _PROTEIN_ p and the _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ assay . although the _PROTEIN_ was shown to possess a high affinity for the _PROTEIN_ its absence did not abolish binding to the _PROTEIN_ stereoisomer as demonstrated by the ability of the construct to interact with both lipids . on the other hand _PROTEIN_ only interacted with the _PROTEIN_ p . although the tpr calmodulin binding domain alone was also over _PROTEIN_ we were unable to solubilise it and the entire amount of protein remained inside the inclusion bodies . the results suggest a differential capacity of the _PROTEIN_ domains for lipid binding as well as the ability of _PROTEIN_ to bind to _PROTEIN_ in the absence of the _PROTEIN_ inspite the _PROTEIN_ that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ do not possess a structural identity to spectrin and predictable _PROTEIN_ binding sites at least not to the same extent as the _PROTEIN_ does . dot blotting of different _PROTEIN_ stereoisomers probed with of the _PROTEIN_ protein and its truncated mutant _PROTEIN_ and detected with _PROTEIN_ . no competing lipid has been added in the incubation _PROTEIN_ of the lipid has been added during the incubation _PROTEIN_ of the lipid has been added during the incubation . dot blotting of different _PROTEIN_ stereoisomers probed with of the _PROTEIN_ truncated mutants and _PROTEIN_ and detected with _PROTEIN_ . characterization of the binding site of _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ p and _PROTEIN_ using the n terminus specific antibody anti _PROTEIN_ . overexpressed _PROTEIN_ was pre incubated with different concentrations of the antibody as indicated prior to its use in a lipid overlay assay and detected with anti _PROTEIN_ . a polyclonal antibody was raised against the bacterially _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as described in the . taking into account that _PROTEIN_ was raised against the denatured protein _PROTEIN_ truncated mutants _PROTEIN_ in cells were purified and run on a polyacrylamide gel . western blotting using _PROTEIN_ as a control in order to confirm that the entire and correct insert was _PROTEIN_ showed that _PROTEIN_ specifically recognizes the n terminus of the protein . in particular the antibody showed no affinity for the tpr calmodulin domain as well as for the _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ . it also showed a highly reduced affinity for the _PROTEIN_ domain not containing the n terminal residues prior to the dssrdr sequence . the antibody showed a complete recognizing ability for the _PROTEIN_ providing that the polylysine rich patch was present _PROTEIN_ . taking into account the specific site of antibody recognition we used the antibody in order to block _PROTEIN_ prior to the incubation in the lipid overlay assay . different concentrations of the _PROTEIN_ antibody were used in a mixture with the protein and following incubation in a lipid overlay assay as previously described _PROTEIN_ was used for the detection of protein lipid interaction . the antibody pre incubation reduced binding affinity for the phosphorylated lipid but not for the lipid phosphorylated at the third position of the inositol _PROTEIN_ . antibody specificity was further verified using both a. thaliana wild type and mutant lines stressed at for up to hrs . results showed that the _PROTEIN_ specifically recognizes endogenous _PROTEIN_ and to a very low extent its homologous partner _PROTEIN_ providing the latter has been accumulated following heat stress . day old a. thaliana wild type _PROTEIN_ knock out _PROTEIN_ of both columbia and wassilevskija background and _PROTEIN_ double mutants were incubated at for up to hrs . anti _PROTEIN_ specifically detects the _PROTEIN_ protein in plant extracts and to a less extent a second upper band _PROTEIN_ following heat treatment only . columbia _PROTEIN_ knock out belongs to the wdslox line . week old a. thaliana plants were incubated with or m nacl . in young leaves collected at different time points _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ accumulation was observed at an mrna level following salt treatment . a fast induction within mins appeared following incubation with m nacl for both rof homologues . mrna accumulation was also observed in the case of _PROTEIN_ in seedlings germinated on high salt/osmotic media compared to the control _METHOD_ . however this accumulation was not observed for _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ accumulation was also observed at a protein level . no apparent differences were however observed in _PROTEIN_ protein accumulation at high salt concentrations compared to lower salt concentrations but an earlier reduction was observed for the hr m nacl treatment compared to the m incubation . protein accumulation was also observed in the case of whole seedlings germinated in high salt _METHOD_ media compared to the control seedlings . the presence of _PROTEIN_ was also confirmed in non germinated seeds only hrs after water imbibition . real time pcr of wild type a. thaliana plants treated for different time points and under different salt concentrations . results are _PROTEIN_ as fold increase relative to the control set at . control represents mock treatment with for the respective time points to the nacl treatment . real time pcr of control wild type day old a. thaliana seedlings germinated on _METHOD_ media and of seedlings

different salt concentrations . control represents mock treatment with for the respective time points to the nacl treatment . western blotting of control wild type day old a. thaliana seedlings germinated on _METHOD_ media and seedlings germinated and grown on _METHOD_ media containing different nacl concentrations . western blotting of ws and seeds hrs after water imbibition . using an a. tumefaciens plant _PROTEIN_ vector we transiently transformed tobacco leaves with constructs containing a full length _PROTEIN_ . a cytoplasmic localization of the protein was observed using a reconstruction as demonstrated by the traces that the embedded organelles mark in the cytoplasm and the cytoplasmic strands formed . a peripheral localization may also be observed more clearly seen in a single confocal section . _PROTEIN_ localization was distinct to _METHOD_ localization since no _LOCATION_ localization of the _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ was observed . in order to confirm the nature of the peripheral localization of _PROTEIN_ a plasmolysis effect caused by m nacl treatment was used . as it is shown the peripheral staining of _PROTEIN_ is not due to a protein association with the cell wall . control green _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ red chloroplast _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ localization and bright field imaging _METHOD_ localization . n indicates _LOCATION_ . scale bars . in order to further verify _PROTEIN_ subcellular localization _METHOD_ microscopy with a. thaliana root tips was used . a. thaliana seedlings were germinated on agar media containing _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ microscopy was performed as described in the . incubation with pre immune serum or _PROTEIN_ staining of _PROTEIN_ plants did not produce any _METHOD_ confirming antibody specificity as described above . in untreated plants and plants treated for a short period of time with high nacl _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ localized in the elongation zone of the root tip . however in plants grown on high salt media the localization pattern changed expanding throughout the meristematic zone . the cytoplasmic localization of _PROTEIN_ was confirmed with _METHOD_ microscopy whereas a stronger peripheral staining was observed in plants grown on high salt media probably indicating _LOCATION_ association . in any case no _LOCATION_ localization was observed . confocal image of untreated plants red _PROTEIN_ blue dapi . _METHOD_ microscope image of plants treated with m nacl for mins . confocal image of plants grown in m nacl red _PROTEIN_ blue dapi . scale bars . several lines of columbia wild type columbia _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ wassilevskija wild type and ws complemented mutants and ws _PROTEIN_ over _PROTEIN_ were confirmed by western blotting using the _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ detection . columbia wt as well as _PROTEIN_ seeds on a columbia background were germinated on media containing different nacl concentrations . although no difference was recorded on the germination rate of plants grown on media without nacl in relation to the wt a significant delay was recorded on the germination of _PROTEIN_ plants germinated on media containing salt concentrations of m nacl . the nacl effect on plant germination was also observed with the wassilevskija wild type and _PROTEIN_ . germination was nearly eliminated at m nacl when the double mutants were used . in order to show that the osmotic effect of _PROTEIN_ is exclusively due to the loss of the _PROTEIN_ gene complemented as well as lines were used . it was shown that gene complementation completely recovered the wild type phenotype whereas gene over _PROTEIN_ resulted in a highly enhanced germination under salinity stress . in order to differentiate between the ionic and the osmotic effect ws and were geminated on media containing m mannitol and the osmotic effect on plant germination was confirmed . germination rate of the wassilevskija background plants ws and on _METHOD_ media containing m nacl . germination rate of the wild type wassilevskija background plants ws and on _METHOD_ media containing m mannitol . three independent characterized lines were used for each genotype . the results show the average of three independent experiments performed for each treatment . values are means and bars are sds . seeds germinated on _METHOD_ media containing m nacl or m mannitol . a. thaliana and seeds were germinated in the presence or absence of wortmannin or under both control and salinity stress conditions . germination was performed in darkness due to the photosensitivity of the wortmannin and . the nacl concentration was m instead of m used in previous experiments due to the _PROTEIN_ that germination efficiency in darkness in the presence of high salt concentrations was severely affected . our results demonstrate that the _PROTEIN_ inhibitors significantly affected seed germination of the double mutants under non stress conditions . in contrast the germination efficiency of the seeds was severely affected in the presence of the _PROTEIN_ inhibitors when plants were germinated on m nacl and in the case of wortmannin treatment exhibited the same phenotype as the plants under salinity stress i.e . their germination was completely abolished . seed germination efficiency of and at different time points under control or salinity stress in the presence or absence of wortmannin or . the results show the average of four independent experiments performed for each treatment . values are means and bars are sds .
