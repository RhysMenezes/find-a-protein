transportin _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is a member of the importin super family that functions as the _LOCATION_ import receptor for serine arginine rich _PROTEIN_ proteins which play diverse roles in rna metabolism . here we report the identification and cloning of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a mutation that suppresses the immune responses conditioned by the auto activated resistance protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ encodes a _LOCATION_ protein with high similarity to previously characterized trn _PROTEIN_ proteins in animals . yeast two hybrid assays showed that _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ via its n terminus and _PROTEIN_ proteins via its c terminus . in _PROTEIN_ localization of several _PROTEIN_ proteins to the _LOCATION_ was impaired confirming that _PROTEIN_ functions as a trn _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ mutation results in altered splicing patterns of _PROTEIN_ and another r gene _PROTEIN_ and compromised resistance mediated by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _LOCATION_ import of _PROTEIN_ proteins by _PROTEIN_ is required for proper splicing of these two r genes and is important for their functions in plant immunity .
arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ constitutively activates defense responses and displays enhanced resistance to pathogens . _PROTEIN_ mutant plants exhibit dwarf morphology with curly leaves . suppressor screens of _PROTEIN_ have previously been carried out using fast neutron and t dna insertional mutagenesis . to identify additional suppressor mutants of _PROTEIN_ we treated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seeds with ethane methyl sulfonate _METHOD_ and screened the plants for mutants that suppressed _PROTEIN_ dwarfism . from this population we identified _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . morphology of five week old soil grown plants of the indicated genotypes . _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the indicated genotypes . rnas were extracted from two week old plants grown on _METHOD_ media and reverse transcribed to obtain cdna for real time pcr analysis . values were normalized to the _PROTEIN_ of the reference gene cyclophilin _PROTEIN_ . _LOCATION_ bars represent of three replicates . free sa and total sa levels in the indicated genotypes . sa was extracted from five week old soil grown plants and measured by hplc . _LOCATION_ bars represent of three replicates . growth of h. a. on the indicated genotypes . plants were inoculated by h. a. at spores/ml and spores were collected and counted seven days _PROTEIN_ . _LOCATION_ bars represent of three replicates . in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ defense marker gene _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are constitutively _PROTEIN_ . as shown in constitutive activation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is suppressed in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . analysis of sa levels also showed that the elevated sa levels in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are suppressed by _PROTEIN_ . to test whether enhanced pathogen resistance in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is affected by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings were _PROTEIN_ with the virulent oomycete pathogen hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis . as shown in resistance to h. a. is lost in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to map the _PROTEIN_ mutation we crossed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with landsberg _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . in the mapping population about a quarter of the progeny showed morphology similar to the triple mutant . crude mapping using plants revealed that _PROTEIN_ is linked to the lower arm of chromosome . further analysis indicated that _PROTEIN_ is flanked by marker and . fine mapping using about plants narrowed _PROTEIN_ to a kb region between marker and . to identify the _PROTEIN_ mutation pcr fragments covering this kb region was amplified directly from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and sequenced . a single g to a mutation was found in which is located at the junction of the intron and exon of the gene . rt pcr analysis using primers flanking the mutation showed that splicing of was affected by the mutation . the rt pcr fragments were cloned into the pgem t vector . subsequent sequence analysis of cdna clones from _PROTEIN_ revealed that they fell into six different classes . all of them represent transcript variants that were incorrectly spliced . an alignment of wild type cdna and the cdna variants from _PROTEIN_ are shown in . mapping of _PROTEIN_ . bac clones and markers are indicated . the _PROTEIN_ mutation is flanked between markers and . gene structure of _PROTEIN_ and the mutation site in _PROTEIN_ . the exons are indicated with boxes and introns with lines . the mutation site is located at the junction between the intron and exon . the lower case letters represent nucleotides in the intron and the uppercase letters represent nucleotides in the exon . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ . primers flanking the mutation site were used to amplify _PROTEIN_ from wild type and _PROTEIN_ cdna . _PROTEIN_ was used as loading control . morphology of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ carrying the _PROTEIN_ transgene . five week old soil grown plants were photographed . _PROTEIN_ stands for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ containing the _PROTEIN_ transgene under its native promoter . restoration of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by the _PROTEIN_ transgene . restoration of resistance to h. a. in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by the _PROTEIN_ transgene . to confirm that the mutation in is responsible for the suppression of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotypes a genomic clone containing was constructed and transformed into _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . transgenic plants from five independent lines carrying the wild type displayed _PROTEIN_ like morphology . further analysis of a representative transgenic line showed that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was similar to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in addition resistance to h. a. was also restored in the transgenic line confirming that complemented _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is . to obtain the _PROTEIN_ single mutant we backcrossed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with wild type plants . the _PROTEIN_ single mutant was obtained by genotyping the plants . the _PROTEIN_ single mutant flowers _PROTEIN_ and has reduced fertility . besides it exhibits small stature . when the genomic clone of was introduced into the _PROTEIN_ single mutants it reverted the size and fertility of the mutant to wild type like and also suppressed the _PROTEIN_ flowering phenotype showing that the developmental phenotypes observed in _PROTEIN_ are caused by the _PROTEIN_ mutation . _PROTEIN_ is a single copy gene in arabidopsis . it encodes a protein with identity and similarity to the trn _PROTEIN_ in drosophila suggesting that _PROTEIN_ may be a transporter for _PROTEIN_ proteins . _PROTEIN_ and its animal homologs are highly conserved at their n terminus which contain the importin n terminal domains . to determine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under its native promoter with a c terminal _METHOD_ tag were generated in both wild type and _PROTEIN_ backgrounds . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ suppresses the developmental phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ suggesting that the fusion protein is functional . confocal _METHOD_ microscopy analysis of transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein showed that the _METHOD_ signal is found exclusively in the _LOCATION_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ protein . in the _LOCATION_ of root cells _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was excluded from a large part of the _LOCATION_ probably the nucleolus . we did not observe similar exclusion of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ from parts of the _LOCATION_ in epidermal cells probably because these _LOCATION_ are much smaller than those in root cells . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in root and epidermal cells from transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under its own promoter in col . cell walls were stained with _PROTEIN_ before confocal microscopy which fluoresces red . in animals trn _PROTEIN_ binds _PROTEIN_ proteins via its c terminus and transport _PROTEIN_ proteins through the _LOCATION_ envelope . binding of ran _PROTEIN_ to the n terminus of trn _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ results in the release of _PROTEIN_ proteins . to test whether _PROTEIN_ is able to interact with _PROTEIN_ proteins the n terminus and c terminus of _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ in the bait vector and four selected arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ proteins _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ in the prey vector for yeast two hybrid assays . as shown in the c terminus but not the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ interacts with the _PROTEIN_ proteins . we also tested the interactions between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . as shown in the n terminus but not the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ . interaction between the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ and the indicated _PROTEIN_ proteins . interaction between the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . mm _PROTEIN_ was included in the medium to increase the stringency of selection . sd synthetic dropout medium . to test whether the _PROTEIN_ mutation affects the _LOCATION_ import of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ proteins we made constructs _PROTEIN_ four _PROTEIN_ genes and _PROTEIN_ with a c terminal _METHOD_ tag . these constructs were transformed into protoplasts of wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants to check for the localization of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins . a construct _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was included as the control . as shown in in both wild type and _PROTEIN_ protoplasts _PROTEIN_ was localized in the _LOCATION_ . consistent with previous studies the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins were clearly localized in the _LOCATION_ of wild type protoplasts . however in _PROTEIN_ protoplasts the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins were _PROTEIN_ localized in the cytoplasm suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is required for the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ proteins . localization of _PROTEIN_ proteins in wild type and _PROTEIN_ protoplasts . protoplasts were prepared from four week old soil grown plants and transformed with of plasmid _PROTEIN_ the indicated _PROTEIN_ protein with a c terminal _METHOD_ tag or _METHOD_ alone . all constructs were under the control of a promoter . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ auto _METHOD_ bf . localization of _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ fusion proteins under the control of promoter in col or _PROTEIN_ background . protoplasts were prepared from four week old soil grown plants and transformed with of plasmid _PROTEIN_ the indicated _PROTEIN_ protein or _PROTEIN_ with a c terminal _METHOD_ tag . all constructs were under the control of a promoter . percentages of protoplasts with corresponding localization pattern were shown . unlike _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ under promoter which is distributed throughout the whole cell the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins were localized to discrete foci in the cytoplasm of _PROTEIN_ protoplasts . the pattern of these foci resembles that of p bodies which are distinct foci in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells containing many enzymes involved in mrna turnover . because of the diverse roles of _PROTEIN_ proteins in rna metabolism it would not be surprising if they also function in p bodies . the effect of _PROTEIN_ on the localization of and _PROTEIN_ was further confirmed in transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins . as shown in _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were localized in discrete foci in the cytoplasm of guard cells in _PROTEIN_ background . the _METHOD_ fusion proteins were also observed in the cytoplasm of leaf pavement cells in _PROTEIN_ . taken together these experiments indicate that _PROTEIN_ is a transporter for _PROTEIN_ proteins . multiple _PROTEIN_ transcripts with intron and intron removed or retained have previously been detected . because none of the transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ cdna exhibit dwarf morphology like _PROTEIN_ mutant plants alternative splicing is probably required for the function of _PROTEIN_ . since _PROTEIN_ affects the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ proteins and _PROTEIN_ proteins participate in pre mrna splice site recognition and spliceosome assembly we tested whether splicing of _PROTEIN_ was affected in _PROTEIN_ . primers flanking the introns of _PROTEIN_ were designed to evaluate its splicing pattern of _PROTEIN_ . consistent with the previous report we detected transcripts with either intron or retained . as shown in we detected another transcript that contains both intron and in addition to the regular transcripts with both intron and removed in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in wild type plants the amount of and is small compared to that of . both and increased dramatically in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . similar alteration of _PROTEIN_ transcript patterns was also observed in the _PROTEIN_ single mutant . since pcr reaction using the rna samples showed no amplification the dna fragments from rt pcr represent _PROTEIN_ transcripts rather than genomic dna contamination . further analysis of _PROTEIN_ transcript variants in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines carrying the wild type _PROTEIN_ transgene showed that the splicing patterns of _PROTEIN_ in the transgenic lines are similar to those in the wild type plants . these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ affects the splicing of the _PROTEIN_ transcript . gene structure of end of _PROTEIN_ . exons are indicated with boxes and introns are indicated with lines . locations of the primers used to amplify the transcript variants are indicated . the lengths of different transcript variants amplified by and are indicated on the right . transcription patterns of _PROTEIN_ in wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . pcr was performed on cdna or rna samples using primer and . rnas incubated in reverse transcription reaction without rtase m mlv were used as the negative control to ensure that genomic dna contamination did not occur . _PROTEIN_ alternative transcription patterns in wild type and _PROTEIN_ . pcr was performed on cdna or rna samples . represents transcripts with both intron and intron retained . and represent two transcripts with similar size which retained either intron or intron . is the regular transcript with intron and intron removed . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . values are normalized to the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . bars represent of three replicates . statistical differences among the samples are labeled with different letters . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ . values are normalized to the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . bars represent of three replicates . statistical differences among the samples are labeled with different letters . the r gene _PROTEIN_ was also reported to be alternatively spliced . we designed primers to detect the transcript variants for _PROTEIN_ by rt pcr . as shown in the levels of are similar in wild type and _PROTEIN_ . however increased considerably and was significantly reduced in _PROTEIN_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ also affects the splicing pattern of _PROTEIN_ transcripts . the altered _PROTEIN_ transcript patterns in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ can be complemented by the _PROTEIN_ transgene . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ has a general role in rna splicing we analyzed splicing of two housekeeping genes and by rt pcr using primers that flank introns . _PROTEIN_ was used as the control because it contains no intron . we found that splicing of and was not affected in _PROTEIN_ . we also analyzed the splicing patterns of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ three genes reported to be alternatively spliced . as shown in the splicing of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but not was clearly affected by _PROTEIN_ . alteration of the transcription patterns of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ further supports the role of _PROTEIN_ in alternative splicing . since the splicing of and is not affected by _PROTEIN_ there may be a certain level of specificity in _PROTEIN_ mediated pre mrna processing . to test whether the splicing defect in _PROTEIN_ leads to a _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts real time rt pcr was carried out using primers to amplify an unspliced region at the end of the two genes . as shown in _PROTEIN_ levels of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ significantly in the presence of the _PROTEIN_ mutation . since _PROTEIN_ altered the splicing pattern of _PROTEIN_ and reduced its _PROTEIN_ we tested whether _PROTEIN_ mediated immunity is affected by _PROTEIN_ . as shown in growth of pseudomonas syringae pv . tomato in _PROTEIN_ is about ten fold higher than that in wild type suggesting _PROTEIN_ mediated immunity is compromised in _PROTEIN_ . we also tested whether _PROTEIN_ is required for basal resistance by _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ plants with the virulent pathogen p.s.t . . as shown in bacterial growth is about ten fold higher in _PROTEIN_ compared to wild type indicating that _PROTEIN_ is also required for basal resistance . growth of p.s.t . on wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . growth of p.s.t . on wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _LOCATION_ bars represent of six replicates . statistical differences among the samples are labeled with different letters .
