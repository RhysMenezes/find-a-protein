_PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is involved in cotranslational and posttranslational sorting of _LOCATION_ proteins . the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ null mutant is pale green with delayed development . western blot analysis of individual leaves showed that the _PROTEIN_ sorting pathway but not the secy/e translocon was strongly down regulated with progressive leaf development in both wild type and plants . to further understand the impact of _PROTEIN_ deletion a quantitative comparison of was carried out for total leaf proteomes of young seedlings and for chloroplast proteomes of fully developed leaves using stable isotope labeling and two dimensional gels . this showed that _PROTEIN_ deletion led to a change in light harvesting complex composition an increase of _PROTEIN_ and a _PROTEIN_ photosystem i/ii ratio . moreover the _PROTEIN_ deletion led in young leaves to up regulation of _LOCATION_ proteases and stromal chaperones including _PROTEIN_ . in contrast the stromal protein homeostasis machinery returned to wild type levels in mature leaves consistent with the developmental down regulation of the _PROTEIN_ pathway . a differential response between young and mature leaves was also found in _PROTEIN_ metabolism with an up regulation of the calvin cycle and the photorespiratory pathway in _LOCATION_ and mitochondria in young leaves but not in old leaves . the calvin cycle was down regulated in mature leaves to adjust to the reduced capacity of the light reaction while reactive oxygen species defense proteins were up regulated . the significance of _PROTEIN_ up regulation was confirmed through the generation of an _PROTEIN_ double mutant . this mutant was seedling lethal under autotrophic conditions but could be partially rescued under heterotrophic conditions .
the mutant was generated by ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis and is devoid of _PROTEIN_ transcript and protein . throughout the remainder of this article we refer to as ffc . when ffc was grown on agar plates under continuous moderate light young seedlings showed yellow first leaves which subsequently became green . however when ffc was grown on soil with a light/dark period at photons plants remained pale green with reduced rosette diameter . to better characterize plant growth and development of ffc wild type and ffc plants were grown on soil under four different light intensities and their visible phenotypes rates of leaf development and rosette diameters were carefully monitored . plants were sown directly on soil without replanting to minimize biological variation . figure shows wild type and ffc plants at d after planting when grown under four different light regimes . ffc plants were always paler with fewer leaves and a to reduction in rosette diameter . bolting was delayed by under each light regime but occurred after formation of the same number of leaves as in the wild type indicating that loss of _PROTEIN_ does result in a delay in development . therefore to understand the role of _PROTEIN_ in chloroplast and leaf development primary _PROTEIN_ effects and secondary developmental effects must be distinguished . the chloroplast sorting machinery is particularly important during early leaf and chloroplast development when protein synthesis and import rates are high . we postulated that the _LOCATION_ protein sorting machinery might be down regulated with progressive leaf development . there has been no systematic investigation of the response of the chloroplast sorting pathway in the ffc mutant . however we note that cpsecy levels were determined in total leaf extracts of and d old ffc and wild type plants grown on agar plates under continuous moderate light this showed that _PROTEIN_ was not affected while cpsecy levels were somewhat increased in ffc . in order to separate changes in protein accumulation due to the ffc mutation from those naturally occurring throughout development we used the developmental stage of both wild type and ffc plants and not the age of plant material as the basis for selecting leaf material for analysis . developmental stages used in this study were as defined by citation . specifically the developmental stage of plants in the vegetative stage is determined by the number of leaves which is indicated by the number after the digit . to monitor the direct effects to the protein sorting machinery along with development in both ffc and wild type plants we first determined the chlorophyll content and total protein content of the cotyledons and leaves and at developmental stages and for each leaf pair . protein to chlorophyll ratios in each leaf _PROTEIN_ strongly during development reflecting assembly of the photosynthetic apparatus and accumulation of chlorophyll in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ ffc leaves trailed in their chlorophyll accumulation . this is consistent with a reduction of chlorophyll levels observed for leaf rosettes of ffc plants compared with the same aged wild type plants . accumulation levels of the cpsrp pathway proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and the _LOCATION_ protein translocons _PROTEIN_ and cpsecy/e were determined for these separate leaf pairs and cotyledons at different developmental plant stages . this showed that accumulation levels of _PROTEIN_ pathway components _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were strongly reduced with progressive leaf development whereas cpsecy and cpsece levels were relatively constant . comparing ffc with wild type leaves showed that when seedlings of the same developmental stage were compared levels of each of these sorting components were similar _PROTEIN_ . this provides additional evidence that comparison of wild type and ffc leaves of similar development stage rather than the same age will best determine the direct effects of _PROTEIN_ deletion . silver stained one dimensional _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of whole leaf extracts of the leaf pairs at the different developmental stages showed that the overall accumulation levels of the family of major lhcii proteins _METHOD_ became more abundant during leaf maturation as expected from previous studies . the lhcii levels were always lower in ffc compared with wild type leaves . as an example the profiles for leaves and at stages and are shown . the levels of chloroplast encoded and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins were determined by western blots . the concentrations of and proteins increased with leaf expansion and were initially lower in ffc than in the wild type . however they reached near equivalent levels in fully expanded leaves in contrast to lhc proteins . this is in agreement with earlier observations for whole seedlings grown of agar plates in continuous light . to further determine the consequences of the loss of _PROTEIN_ during early stages of leaf development total cellular leaf proteomes of ffc and wild type plants were compared using itraq based protein quantification . to account for developmental delays that may mask direct effects of the loss of _PROTEIN_ we compared young ffc seedlings with an average of seven true leaves with wild type seedlings of the same age and wild type seedlings of the same developmental stage . plants at these developmental stages are shown in figure . total cellular leaf proteomes were extracted in the presence of _PROTEIN_ followed by removal of lipids and detergents in an optimized protocol for the recovery of integral _LOCATION_ proteins . each proteome was subsequently digested in solution with trypsin . a total of of each digested proteome was labeled with the different itraq reagents containing the or d reporter . the labeled peptides were then mixed and separated using off line strong cation exchange chromatography . eight fractions from each scx run were analyzed using on line reversed phase nano liquid chromatography electrospray tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the three seedling stages were directly compared within each labeling experiment and a label switch was included to remove a possible labeling bias . these experiments were carried out with two independent biological replicates . the structure of this isobaric tagging reagent the labeling scheme labeling principles and quantification are explained in supplemental figure . a total of proteins were identified unambiguously with one or more unique peptides using an established bioinformatics pipeline that included a _PROTEIN_ database search and a false positive peptide identification rate of less than . in addition proteins were identified as part of small gene families in particular in the lhc family and ribosomal proteins . relevant extracted information from the _METHOD_ analysis is shown in supplemental table and can also be found in the plant proteomics database _PROTEIN_ . about of the identified proteins are localized in the chloroplast using the curated subcellular localization as described by citation . a total of of the identified proteins have at least one confirmed tmd which is close to the predicted for the whole arabidopsis proteome . the ffc/wild type ratios of proteins were quantified in both biological replicates additional proteins quantified in only one replicate are not further discussed . details of the quantifications can be found in supplemental table . the average coefficient of variation for the ffc/wild type ratio between the biological replicates was . the quantified proteome covered mostly chloroplast stromal and _LOCATION_ proteins . quantified proteins outside the chloroplast were enriched for peroxisomal and mitochondrial proteins involved in photorespiration as well as for _LOCATION_ proteins involved in protein synthesis . the ffc/wild type ratios that are below or above and are also sd away from unity are marked in boldface . this corresponds to p < assuming normal distribution . quantified proteins in seedlings using itraq with two biological replicates between and and comparative analysis of soluble stromal proteins from isolated chloroplasts of fully developed leaf rosettes of ffc and wt plants using icat when comparing the two wild type seedling developmental stages it is notable that levels of major lhci and lhcii antennae proteins in the _LOCATION_ proteome increase up to during these d of plant growth reflecting the buildup of the photosynthetic apparatus during leaf development . this also underlines the importance of accounting for a developmental delay when addressing the role of _PROTEIN_ and biogenesis of the lhc family . interestingly accumulation of the subunits of psi and psii core complexes and the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ synthase complex increased on average only by and respectively indicating that assembly of the peripheral antennae complexes trails the accumulation of the psi and psii cores as well as _PROTEIN_ synthase . levels of quantified calvin cycle enzymes and most other quantified functions inside and outside of the chloroplast did not change between stages and in wild type seedlings . we note that the ffc/wild type ratios within these complexes and pathways were highly consistent providing additional testimony for the accuracy and significance of the quantitative analysis . there are lhc proteins in the antennae of psi and psii and they are arranged in six lhcii and five lhci subfamilies . they contain a partially conserved hydrophilic domain located between tmds and this domain was shown to be essential for interaction with _PROTEIN_ and formation of the transit complex . we detected and quantified nine out of the lhc subfamilies their accumulation levels in ffc were between and of levels . when comparing lhc levels in and these accumulation levels were further reduced as a consequence of the developmental delay . compared with other lhc members the lhcii family was most reduced while _PROTEIN_ was unaffected . the abundant _PROTEIN_ protein with pigment binding domains and four tmds accumulated at higher levels in ffc than in the wild type in agreement with observations that _PROTEIN_ does not require the _PROTEIN_ pathway in vivo and can stably accumulate in the _LOCATION_ independent of psii . the four major complexes psii psi the _PROTEIN_ synthase and the cytochrome complex contain several chloroplast encoded integral _LOCATION_ proteins that are potential substrates of the _PROTEIN_ dependent cotranslational insertion pathway . the accumulation levels of these chloroplast encoded proteins could be directly affected by the lack of _PROTEIN_ in the ffc mutant . the _LOCATION_ encoded subunits in these complexes are not known to require the cpsrp pathway . within the psii core complex proteins were quantified including five chloroplast encoded proteins the _LOCATION_ encoded integral _LOCATION_ core protein _PROTEIN_ and the three _LOCATION_ encoded proteins of the water splitting complex _PROTEIN_ . the average accumulation of psii core proteins in ffc was reduced when compared with and reduced when compared with . the sec dependent _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ dependent were unaffected in ffc while the two _PROTEIN_ dependent homologues showed a strong differential response suggesting that they have complementary functions . five psi core subunits were quantified the major psi core subunits _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and psad _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ . an average reduction of for these psi core subunits was observed when comparing ffc with which increased to when comparing ffc with . when comparing the changes in accumulation for the core subunits of these two _METHOD_ it is clear that the psi/psii ratio is lower in ffc as compared with the wild type . the psi/psii ratio does not change during the d of development in the wild type but is only about of the wild type ratio in ffc seedlings . three chloroplast encoded _PROTEIN_ and two _LOCATION_ encoded peripheral _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ synthase subunits as well as one _LOCATION_ encoded integral _PROTEIN_ synthase subunit were quantified . the peripheral subunits of this complex were reduced by in ffc as compared with and by compared with while ii was unaffected in ffc . in vitro studies suggested that the ii protein inserts spontaneously into the _LOCATION_ which is consistent with our observations . stromal chaperones _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ involved in protein folding and maturation as well as a highly abundant protein isomerase without known function _PROTEIN_ increased to in ffc as compared with . the increase was slightly higher when compared with . _PROTEIN_ and levels increased in the ffc mutant compared with both and . _PROTEIN_ and are members of the _PROTEIN_ family in particular _PROTEIN_ has been shown to be involved in protein import . _PROTEIN_ and are likely also involved in the delivery of proteins for degradation to the stromal clppr protease complex . three abundant rna binding proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ involved in mrna stability and the elongation _PROTEIN_ and chaperone ef accumulated to higher levels in ffc . the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteases _PROTEIN_ and accumulated to higher levels in ffc compared with the wild type suggesting an increased need for degradation within the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the small and large subunits of rubisco accumulated at slightly lower levels in ffc . in contrast nine other calvin cycle enzymes accumulated on average at higher levels in ffc compared with . eight peroxisomal and mitochondrial proteins involved in various aspects of photorespiration were quantified . glycolate oxidases and the first respiratory enzymes in the _LOCATION_ increased by in ffc as compared with . consistently catalases and involved in the detoxification of hydrogen peroxide released by glycolate oxidases increased in ffc . three mitochondrial photorespiratory enzymes were quantified . the p protein of the gly decarboxylase complex increased by in ffc when compared with while the t subunit was unaffected . the enzyme immediately downstream of gly decarboxylase gly/ser hydroxymethyltransferase increased by in ffc when compared with . chloroplast stromal glu synthase involved in the photorespiratory cycle as well as nitrogen assimilation was not significantly affected in ffc . nine _LOCATION_ proteins involved in protein synthesis and folding were quantified . however several peptides used for these quantifications matched multiple members of the respective protein families reducing the value of the quantification . nevertheless it appears that _LOCATION_ protein homeostasis was not or only slightly affected . three enzymes of the _LOCATION_ s adenosyl met cycle were quantified but did not show any consistent change in ffc . to compare the mature chloroplast proteomes of wild type and ffc plants chloroplasts were isolated from fully grown rosettes prior to bolting from d old wild type plants and d old ffc plants both at growth stage as defined by citation fig . a and b . the isolated chloroplasts were fractionated into soluble stroma and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the isolated _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were stripped of lumenal and peripheral proteins and the remaining _LOCATION_ proteomes of ffc and the wild type were compared using itraq labeling and quantification by _METHOD_ analysis . the stromal proteomes of wild type and ffc plants were compared using differential stable isotope labeling with cleavable icat as well as gels using immobilized ph gradient strips in the first dimension and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the second dimension . in addition wild type and ffc stroma were also analyzed by _PROTEIN_ using native gels in the first dimension _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the second dimension . the stromal icat analysis was carried out with two biological replicates and included a label switch between the wild type and ffc . an overview of the procedure is provided in figure with an explanation provided in its legend . the two icat experiments identified and proteins totaling proteins _PROTEIN_ . since on average only about of tryptic peptides contain a cys a significant proportion of the identified proteins were not quantified . a total of and icat labeled peptide pairs were manually quantified in experiments and respectively . after removing peptides matched to proteins that did not pass the identification criteria and peptides were matched to identified proteins . we did not detect unlabeled cys containing peptides indicating that the icat labeling was saturating . this was expected as the icat reagent is an efficient alkylating reagent that was added in large excess . forty six proteins were quantified in both biological replicates with an average cv for ffc/wild type protein ratios of . a few proteins were not quantified individually but as small clusters of closely related family members . we focus on the proteins that were quantified in both experiments and passed the strict identification filters . these proteins include members of the major biosynthetic pathways _PROTEIN_ as well as protein synthesis and folding _PROTEIN_ and protein degradation _PROTEIN_ . while most of the ffc/wild type protein ratios were close to levels of quantified calvin cycle enzymes were systematically reduced in ffc which is consistent with the reduced lhc cross section and _PROTEIN_ in growth rates _LOCATION_ . stromal ascorbate peroxidase was significantly increased by suggesting an increased level of hydrogen peroxide and consistent with fold up regulation of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase as shown by gel analysis . it was also clear that there was no increased demand for either protein folding or stromal protein degradation since the major chaperone _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ as well as _PROTEIN_ and and the abundant stromal metalloprotease _PROTEIN_ accumulated at wild type levels . we finally note that three clppr subunits of the major stromal clp protease complex were also at wild type levels . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ analysis of ffc and wild type stroma did not show any obvious differences . the rubisco holocomplex of approximately kd represents of the stromal protein _METHOD_ in isolated chloroplasts from fully developed arabidopsis leaf rosettes . this strongly reduces the resolving power of gels using isoelectric focusing as the first dimension . since our previous and current _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gel analysis showed that most abundant stromal proteins are found in monomers or complexes below kd we fractionated stroma from wild type and ffc plants by suc density centrifugation and collected proteins sedimenting above the rubisco complex as two fractions . these two fractions were each focused in the first dimension on ipg strips and then separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the second dimension . the experiment was carried out in duplicate using independent chloroplast preparations and including a technical replicate for fraction resulting in gels . protein spots were then matched across the gels and quantified using image analysis software . the most abundant spots were analyzed by peptide _METHOD_ fingerprinting using _PROTEIN_ assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight _METHOD_ to ensure correct spot matching and to identify proteins in up and down regulated spots . we were able to match and quantify spots across fraction and spots across fraction while spots were matched and quantified across both fractions . most spots did not show significant changes consistent with the icat analysis of the stroma showing that proteome homeostasis returned to steady state in fully developed leaves . however we did find significant changes for cuznsod and an oxidoreductase like protein of unknown function . both proteins likely relate to reactive oxygen species defense and/or redox regulation . the two independent stripped _LOCATION_ preparations of wild type and ffc were digested with trypsin and labeled with itraq reagents and a label switch was included for each independent preparation . the two sets were fractionated by off line scx chromatography and fractions were analyzed by nano lc esi _METHOD_ similar to the seedling samples discussed above . this unambiguously identified proteins with one or more uniquely matched peptides and an additional nine proteins were identified as part of small protein families _PROTEIN_ . we quantified proteins in both biological replicates and only those are considered . quantified proteins in ffc and wild type _LOCATION_ of mature rosettes using itraq with two biological replicates accumulation levels of lhci and major lhcii were reduced between and in ffc while accumulation of the minor lhc proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was unaffected or even slightly increased . however _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by . accumulation levels of quantified psii core proteins in ffc increased on average by while the six quantified psi core proteins _PROTEIN_ on average by . consequently the psi/psii core ratio _PROTEIN_ by in ffc as compared with the wild type in fully grown plants . accumulation levels of subunits of _PROTEIN_ synthase and the cytochrome complex did not change . interestingly accumulation levels of _LOCATION_ proteases _PROTEIN_ and doubled in ffc suggesting an increased need for degradation of _LOCATION_ proteins similar to the findings in young seedlings . a central component in chloroplast protein biogenesis is the aaa chaperone _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ predominantly accumulates in the chloroplast stroma but it has also been shown to interact with the inner envelope protein import complex . a null mutant in _PROTEIN_ was isolated and has a virescent phenotype and reduced protein import rates . a null mutant in a closely related homolog _PROTEIN_ at lower levels _PROTEIN_ does not have any visible phenotype . _PROTEIN_ is not only involved in the chloroplast import process but also likely targets proteins to the clppr core complex for degradation . it is conceivable that the functional association of _PROTEIN_ with the tic complex is to keep this major protein import pathway free from substrates that are trapped in the translocon . the comparative proteomics analysis of young ffc and wild type seedlings described above as well as previous western blot data showed that _PROTEIN_ and levels are increased by to in young ffc plants . given the relevance of _PROTEIN_ in both import and degradation we isolated a _PROTEIN_ null mutant _PROTEIN_ and crossed it with ffc . double homozygous mutants were recovered in the generation and reverse transcription pcr confirmed the lack of mrna for both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the double mutant was blocked in development after emergence of the cotyledons under autotrophic conditions but it could be partially rescued under heterotrophic conditions . under these heterotrophic conditions the double mutant developed and greened slowly and could eventually be transferred to soil . after about months the plants finally flowered and produced low amounts of viable seed . the strong phenotype _METHOD_ the significance of the itraq based quantification in young seedlings and indicates that _PROTEIN_ is of particular importance when intraplastid sorting is disturbed .
the ffc mutant previously characterized was originally isolated from an ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis screen and shown to have an approximately kb insertion in intron of the gene encoding _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ mutant is a t dna insertional mutant in _GENE_ in the columbia ecotype obtained from the salk collection . the t dna is inserted in the fourth exon at bp from the start codon which was confirmed by dna sequencing . the ffc mutant was crossed to _PROTEIN_ and the population was screened on soil in short days . no double homozygotes were found but screening the population on half strength murashige and skoog _METHOD_ plates containing suc in short days identified an ffc _PROTEIN_ double mutant . ffc _PROTEIN_ double mutant plants exhibit seedling lethality when grown only on _METHOD_ medium without suc in short days . mrna levels in wild type _PROTEIN_ ffc and ffc _PROTEIN_ plants were determined from d old plants grown in short days on half strength _METHOD_ medium containing suc by rt pcr . total rna was isolated from approximately mg of tissue from these plants using tri reagent . cdna was amplified from of total leaf rna with superscript iii . primers for _PROTEIN_ were used to amplify the entire coding sequence of bp . primers for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were used to amplify a bp segment at the n terminal portion of the gene . for chloroplast isolation stroma purification _LOCATION_ preparation and total plant protein isolation wild type and ffc plants were grown on soil under a h h dark period at at photons . individual leaf pairs at defined stages were collected and frozen in liquid nitrogen . around to leaves were pooled for small leaves around eight to for medium sized leaves and two to six for big leaves . frozen leaves were ground with mortar and pestle in of medium containing mm tris hcl mm edta and water soluble irreversible ser protease inhibitor pefablok and subsequently filtered through nylon mesh . proteins were then either precipitated in acetone or _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were collected by centrifugation at for min . protein pellets were solubilized in to of _PROTEIN_ and mm tris hcl and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ pellets were solubilized in of m urea _PROTEIN_ m suc and mm tris hcl . before starting the western blotting analysis of the leaf pairs titrations were carried out to determine the linearity of the antibodies directed against _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cpsecy and _PROTEIN_ using wild type and leaf material from young leaves . based on these titrations of total leaf protein extract was loaded for analysis of _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ and for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ corresponding to of total leaf protein extract were loaded for analysis of cpsecy and cpsece . a fragment of _PROTEIN_ was overexpressed in escherichia coli gel purified and injected into rabbits for the production of polyclonal antiserum and the serum was used at . generation of cpsece serum has been described . rabbit polyclonal antisera raised against cpsecy _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were kind gifts from neil e. hoffmann . the _PROTEIN_ sera were kind gifts of laurent nussaume and ralph henry . proteins were separated on or laemmli _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gels containing m urea and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride _LOCATION_ . for cpsece proteins were separated on an to gradient tricine _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gel containing m urea and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride _LOCATION_ . bound primary antisera were detected with secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence . proteins from total tissue were isolated from wild type and ffc seedlings at growth stage and for wild type seedlings at growth stage . ten seedlings of each developmental stage and genotype were ground in extraction buffer _PROTEIN_ in a mortar . the supernatant was filtered through a miracloth and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at for min at . each sample was precipitated in or acetone at . the protein pellets were collected by centrifugation at for min at followed by solubilization in _PROTEIN_ and protein determination using the bicinchoninic acid method . _LOCATION_ were purified from fully developed leaves using a combination of differential and gradient centrifugation steps as described previously . soluble and peripheral proteins were removed by stripping the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as follows _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were resuspended at mg chlorophyll in ice cold mm hepes koh buffer containing a cocktail of protease inhibitors as listed . the suspension was diluted times with ice cold solutions of m kbr and _PROTEIN_ to a final concentration of m. the suspension was stirred slowly for min on ice with s sonication steps every min . _LOCATION_ were collected by centrifugation at for min at washed with mm hepes koh buffer with sonication to remove the remaining salts followed by centrifugation at for min to collect the stripped _LOCATION_ . the _LOCATION_ were then solubilized with mm tris hcl m urea and _PROTEIN_ . a total of of protein from each sample was incubated overnight at with of acetone followed by centrifugation washing the pellet with acetone methanol acetic acid and water in acetone followed by min of incubation at followed by a final centrifugation to collect the protein . the proteins were solubilized in of _METHOD_ followed by dilution with digestion buffer to a final concentration of mm ammonium bicarbonate and _METHOD_ . after adding trypsin to a protein trypsin ratio of the samples were incubated on a shaker overnight at . after digestion the _METHOD_ was removed by evaporation in a speedvac and the peptides were dissolved in of formic acid . a total of from each sample was divided into aliquots in two tubes and dried down . a total of of water was added to each tube and evaporated to remove residual ammonium bicarbonate . then of m triethyl ammonium bicarbonate was added to each tube and vortexed . each peptide sample was mixed with a whole tube of labeling itraq reagent _METHOD_ and incubated on a shaker at room temperature for h. the samples to be compared were pooled and of fa per sample was added per label to set the ph . finally the solutions were diluted to times the reaction volume with acetonitrile and fa . the itraq labeled peptides were separated using scx chromatography on a polysulfoethyl a column from polylc connected to an agilent hplc system . solution a was acn and solution b was acn and m ammonium formate . a total of of each sample was injected five times before eluting the peptides off the column at a flow rate of as follows b to min to to min to to min to to min to min to to min to min . the fractions were collected on microtiter plates . the fractions were lyophilized and resuspended with fa . for identification and quantification the eight scx fractions containing the majority of the peptides were analyzed by data dependent on line tandem _METHOD_ using caplc esi _METHOD_ as described previously . proteins were identified by searching the _METHOD_ data against the _PROTEIN_ database concatenated with a _PROTEIN_ in which all sequences were in reverse orientation using mascot with a significance threshold of . the maximum _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ tolerance for precursor and product ions was set at and d respectively . search criteria were as follows full tryptic peptides only variable met oxidation fixed itraq modification for n termini and lys residues and variable itraq modification for tyr residues . in addition only _METHOD_ spectra with ion scores of or higher were considered for identification although lower ion scores were allowed for quantification . mascot distiller was used to calculate peak areas and extract _METHOD_ to charge ratio values of the precursor ions areas and retention times . the peak areas of the reporter ions were extracted and then corrected for label purity with parameters supplied by applied _METHOD_ using a program written by dr. qi sun . the quantified reporter ion information for each fragmented precursor ion was coupled to the queries matched to protein accessions quantifications for queries that were not used for identification were removed . when queries were used to identify more than one peptide only the best match was kept unless it seemed that more than one peptide was fragmented at the same time . in the latter case the spectrum was used for the normalization but discarded for the statistical analysis of the proteins since the reporter ions would originate from two different sources . after normalization the peptides were grouped according to peptide sequence and the areas of reporter ions originating from the same peptide sequence were added together to prevent one peptide sequence from biasing the protein average . the peptides were then grouped according to the proteins they matched . the sequences of the proteins that had shared peptides were aligned using multi align and the peptide sequence was matched to the alignment to clarify the peptide protein relationship . unique and shared peptides were kept separate to not compromise the data and averages and sd values for the individual biological replicates were calculated using the ratios from the labeling experiments . outliers were removed conservatively using the sd . isolation of chloroplasts and extraction of stromal proteins were carried out as described . a total of mg of purified total concentrated stroma from both wild type and ffc chloroplasts was loaded onto a ml to continuous suc gradient . gradients were spun at for h at rpm in an ultracentrifuge and manually fractionated at into four fractions . a total of of protein from fraction and fraction was precipitated in acetone resuspended in rehydration buffer and rehydrated onto cm pi to ipg strips . strips were focused in the first dimension reduced alkylated and run in the second dimension on to tris hcl criterion gels . gels were fixed in methanol and acetic acid for h and stained with sypro ruby o/n . gels were then destained in fix solution and rinsed with double distilled water for min and images were acquired with a fluor s unit . spot quantification was performed using phoretix software . final spot volumes were normalized to total gel volume for each gel . stained gel spots were excised manually or using a propic robot . the spots were washed digested with modified trypsin and extracted using a progest robot . the extracted peptides were dried and resuspended in of fa . protein identification was performed by peptide _METHOD_ fingerprinting using maldi tof _METHOD_ in reflectron mode _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . peak lists from the maldi data were generated using moverz software m/z using a minimum signal to noise ratio of and peak resolution of . the peak lists were searched against using mascot version with a maximum p value of . criteria for positive identification by maldi tof _METHOD_ peptide _METHOD_ fingerprinting included five or more matching peptides with a narrow _LOCATION_ distribution _LOCATION_ within ppm and at least sequence coverage . only peptides without missed cleavages were considered with met oxidation as variable modification and _PROTEIN_ methylation as fixed modification . in exceptional cases four matching peptides were considered as positive identification . a total of of purified stromal proteins from wild type and ffc plants was denatured and reduced using mm tcep hcl . all cys residues were labeled with the light or heavy icat reagent according to the manufacturer 's instructions _METHOD_ . labeling reactions were performed separately by incubation at for h. after labeling the samples were combined and proteins separated by one dimensional _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ followed by _METHOD_ brilliant blue r staining . the gel lane containing the icat labeled samples was completely cut into slices . each slice was cut into pieces washed and digested with modified trypsin and the resulting peptides were eluted principally as described . after vacuum concentration of acn mm mm kcl and of affinity loaded buffer were added to each sample as described . the biotin tagged peptides were purified on avidin columns as instructed by the manufacturer . protein digests were qualitatively analyzed by maldi tof _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to confirm total digestion and/or labeling . labeled peptides were then loaded on a guard column followed by separation on a pepmap reversed phase nano column using min gradients with water acn and fa and acn water and fa at a flow rate of nl . the labeled peptide mixtures were analyzed by lc esi _METHOD_ . each icat labeled sample was run in duplicate under the same chromatographic settings . for protein quantification the samples were first analyzed in _METHOD_ mode and the areas of the peptides were calculated using _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the second run was set up for data dependent _METHOD_ acquisition for protein identification . the flow through from the avidin column purifications was also collected and analyzed by _METHOD_ after off line desalting on _METHOD_ . the experiment was carried out in duplicate with independent chloroplast preparations and label switch to avoid a possible bias due to the icat label . all quantified peptides and details are listed in supplemental table . criteria for protein identification were similar to those for the itraq labeled peptides except that a variable icat modification was included . _METHOD_ based information for all identified proteins listed in supplemental table was extracted from the mascot search pages and filtered for significance ambiguities and shared peptides as described . this information includes mowse score number of matching peptides number of matched _METHOD_ spectra number of unique queries highest peptide score highest peptide _LOCATION_ lowest
