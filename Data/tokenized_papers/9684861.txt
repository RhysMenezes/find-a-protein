a cdna clone encoding a histidyl trna synthetase was characterized from arabidopsis thaliana . the deduced amino acid sequence _PROTEIN_ is surprisingly more similar to hisrss from archaebacteria than those from eukaryotes and prokaryotes . _PROTEIN_ has an n terminal extension with features characteristic of mitochondrial and chloroplast transit peptides . transient _PROTEIN_ assays in tobacco protoplasts clearly demonstrated efficient targeting of a fusion peptide consisting of the first amino acids of _PROTEIN_ joined to jellyfish green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ to both mitochondria and chloroplasts . these observations suggest that the cdna encodes both mitochondrial and chloroplast histidyl trna synthetases .
two distinct types of arabidopsis cdnas with deduced amino acid sequences similar to those of known hisrss from other _METHOD_ have been reported as _PROTEIN_ sequence tags . one of them probably represents a cdna for _LOCATION_ hisrs because the deduced amino acid sequence is much more similar to _LOCATION_ hisrss from rice and humans than to e. coli hisrs . the other type shares moderate sequence similarity rather equally with hisrss from eukaryotes prokaryotes and archaebacteria and thus was selected as a possible candidate for an organellar enzyme . the complete sequencing of the clone revealed that it encodes a probable full length cdna of bp for a novel hisrs termed _PROTEIN_ . the deduced amino acid sequence revealed extensive overall similarity with hisrs sequences from other _METHOD_ . surprisingly the _PROTEIN_ amino acid sequence is most similar to hisrss from archaebacterial counterparts i.e . amino acid identity with methanococcus jannaschii hisrs and identity with methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum hisrs respectively . in contrast the _PROTEIN_ sequence displays less similarity to hisrss from eukaryotes and prokaryotes i.e . and amino acid identity with those from rice _LOCATION_ e. coli and human _LOCATION_ respectively . _PROTEIN_ contains all three conserved sequence motifs characteristic of class ii aminoacyl trna synthetases as shown in . furthermore two sequence blocks conserved among known hisrss are clearly present in the _PROTEIN_ sequence i.e . vvrglayy and _PROTEIN_ . these blocks have been shown to form a histidine binding pocket from the analysis of the three dimensional structure of hisrss from e. coli and t. thermophilus . the conservation of the motifs described above together with the considerable sequence identity of _PROTEIN_ with hisrss from other _METHOD_ strongly suggest that this is a functional hisrs . the existence of the other est clone for _LOCATION_ type hisrs mentioned above indicated that _PROTEIN_ may function in a different subcellular compartment i.e . mitochondria and/or chloroplasts . consistent with this idea the hisrs alignment revealed the presence of an n terminal extension in _PROTEIN_ with a possible role in organelle targeting . _PROTEIN_ is amino acids longer at the n terminus than the m. jannaschii hisrs and even amino acids longer than the s. cerevisiae mitochondrial hisrs which has a amino acid mitochondrial presequence at its n terminus . the first amino acids of _PROTEIN_ are enriched for leucine serine and arginine residues and contain only a single acidic residue . this biased composition is a common hallmark for mitochondrial and chloroplast targeting sequences . the mitoprot ii software strongly predicts that the _PROTEIN_ presequence is a mitochondrial targeting sequence . to examine copy number of the archaebacterial like hisrs gene in the arabidopsis genome we performed southern blot analysis using the _PROTEIN_ cdna as a probe . under stringent washing conditions only single band was evident in each lane corresponding to the gene encoding _PROTEIN_ . however when less stringent conditions were used with the same filter an additional band was detected in each lane suggesting another related gene in the arabidopsis genome . in agreement with these observations another est sequence has been reported recently from arabidopsis that resembles the _PROTEIN_ cdna . we confirmed by sequence analysis that the second est clone corresponds to a partial cdna including nt of coding region with nucleotide identity with the c terminal portion of the _PROTEIN_ cdna . a nt deletion in a well conserved region towards the c terminus _PROTEIN_ results in a frame shift of the final codons of the cdna . as this region of hisrs is thought to be involved in trna his binding one can wonder whether this sequence encodes a functional hisrs . when the second est clone was used as a hybridization probe on the same filter strong signals were observed in exactly the same positions as the weaker bands with the _PROTEIN_ cdna probe demonstrating that the second gene copy corresponds to this est . we conclude that at least two archaebacterial like hisrs sequences of more than nucleotide identity are encoded in the arabidopsis genome although it is not yet apparent whether the second gene is functional . to determine the cellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ product a recombinant plasmid _METHOD_ was constructed in which the first codons of the _PROTEIN_ cdna encoding the putative targeting peptide were fused to the coding sequence of aequorea victoria green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . as controls we used fusion constructs encoding coxiv _METHOD_ and reca _METHOD_ in which the targeting peptides from yeast mitochondrial coxiv and arabidopsis chloroplast reca respectively were fused to _METHOD_ . it has already been established that these two fusion proteins are faithfully targeted to each organelle upon _PROTEIN_ in plant cells . when the reca _METHOD_ fusion construct was introduced into tobacco leaf protoplasts by electroporation and analyzed by confocal _METHOD_ microscopy _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was localized exclusively in oval structures in diameter and perfectly matched with red _METHOD_ from chloroplast pigments demonstrating that this fusion protein is efficiently targeted to chloroplasts in this system . in cells _PROTEIN_ the coxiv _METHOD_ fusion protein green _METHOD_ was observed in hundreds of round oval or rod like particles of diameter scattered throughout the cytoplasm indicating that the coxiv _METHOD_ fusion proteins were efficiently delivered into mitochondria . a very similar pattern was obtained by staining protoplasts with the mitochondrial specific dye mitotracker red . in cells _PROTEIN_ the athrs _METHOD_ fusion protein the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was found to be localized in both mitochondria and chloroplasts . a low resolution double staining experiment using athrs _METHOD_ and mitotracker red showed that the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in mitochondria corresponded to the staining pattern seen with the dye confirming the mitochondrial localization of the athrs _METHOD_ fusion protein . the strength of the athrs _METHOD_ signals in mitochondria and chloroplasts was somewhat lower than those of either of the organelle specific controls . supposing the level of _PROTEIN_ is the same in these three fusion constructs this may be partly due to dilution of the _METHOD_ because of the dual targeting . no background green _METHOD_ was detected in the _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ indicating the targeting was highly specific in all cases .
