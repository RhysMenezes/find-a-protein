_PROTEIN_ was originally reported as a centrosome associated protein in human cells . however _PROTEIN_ protein containing highly conserved spry lish ctlh and cra domains is currently considered as a scaffolding protein with multiple cellular functions . a plant homologue of _PROTEIN_ has not yet been characterized . based on sequence similarity we identified a homologue of the human _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis thaliana . atranbpm protein has highly conserved spry lish ctlh and cra domains . cell fractionation showed that endogenous atranbpm or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ atranbpm are _PROTEIN_ cytoplasmic proteins with only a minor portion detectable in microsomal fractions . atranbpm was identified predominantly in the form of soluble cytoplasmic complexes kda in size . immunopurification of atranbpm followed by _METHOD_ spectrometric analysis identified proteins containing lish and cra domains lish cra _PROTEIN_ u box domains and a repeats in a complex with atranbpm . homologues of identified proteins are known to be components of the c terminal to the lish motif complexes in humans and budding yeast . microscopic analysis of _METHOD_ atranbpm in vivo and _METHOD_ localization of endogenous atranbpm protein in cultured cells and seedlings of arabidopsis showed _PROTEIN_ cytoplasmic and _LOCATION_ localization . absence of colocalization with tubulin was consistent with the biochemical data and suggests another than a centrosomal role of the atranbpm protein . we showed that as yet uncharacterized arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ protein physically interacts with lish ctlh domain containing proteins . the newly identified high molecular weight cytoplasmic protein complexes of atranbpm showed homology with ctlh types of complexes described in mammals and budding yeast . although the exact functions of the ctlh complexes in scaffolding of protein degradation in protein interactions and in signalling from the periphery to the cell centre are not yet fully understood structural conservation of the complexes across eukaryotes suggests their important biological role .
by homology search of the arabidopsis thaliana genome we found a spry domain containing protein atranbpm which is a homologue of the human _PROTEIN_ protein . the atranbpm cdna contains a single open reading frame and consists of amino acids . atranbpm is a member of the gene family that comprises genes in plant species particularly from the subfamily . in arabidopsis there are three paralogues of atranbpm and one gene originating from the segmental duplication of chromosome _PROTEIN_ . the products of these genes are described as spry domain containing proteins but their biological roles in plants have not yet been identified . the atranbpm protein is composed of four domains spry lish ctlh and cra . spry lish ctlh and cra domain containing proteins are widely spread across eukaryotes . the protein encoded by atranbpm is annotated as a protein of unknown function _PROTEIN_ . as shown in figure b atranbpm has close homologues in other plant species such as ricinus communis vitis vinifera populus trichocarpa sorghum bicolor zea mays and oryza sativa japonica group . the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ shows a close identity and similarity to its spry lish ctlh and cra domains with mammalian _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . however there is an insertion of about amino acids between the ctlh and cra domains in human proteins . a phylogenetic analysis performed using software _PROTEIN_ revealed that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ grouped with homologues from other plant species . the metazoan _PROTEIN_ homologues grouped in a separated clade . the saccharomyces homologue appears to be ancestral to the plant and metazoan clades . domain organization ofarabidopsisranbpm protein and its plant and human homologues.a atranbpm protein consists of highly conserved spry lish ctlh and cra domains . b comparison of atranbpm protein with its closest plant homologues . rco ricinus communis vvi vitis vinifera ptr populus trichocarpa sbi sorghum bicolor osa oryza sativa zma zea mays . c comparison of atranbpm protein with its closest human homologues . bold black lines indicate the amino acids insertion between ctlh and cra domains present only in human but not in plant _PROTEIN_ proteins . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of kda _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of kda . spry lish ctlh and cra conserved domains are _PROTEIN_ involved in protein protein interactions . the spry domain was originally identified as a structural motif in ryanodine receptors _PROTEIN_ . proteins with spry domains are involved in intracellular calcium release as is the case for ryanodine receptors in rna metabolism and in regulatory and developmental processes _PROTEIN_ . the lish domain functions as a stable homodimerization and dimerization motif and its contribution to the dynamics of microtubules has been suggested _PROTEIN_ . located adjacent to the c terminus of the lish domain is a c terminal to the lish motif that has a putative helical structure with an as yet undescribed function . the cra domain _PROTEIN_ was found to be a motif in the c terminal part of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and represents a protein protein interaction domain often found in ran binding proteins _PROTEIN_ . putative interaction sites of atranbpm were analysed using elm _PROTEIN_ and sumosp databases _PROTEIN_ . there are common motifs in the atranbpm amino acid sequence such as phosphorylation consensus sites for phosphoinositide oh kinase related kinases a protein kinase a phosphorylation site a mitogen activated protein kinase phosphorylation site and docking motif and a putative cyclin recognition site . further the atranbpm amino acid sequence possesses forkhead associated phosphopeptide binding domains and a y based sorting signal which might act in endosomal and secretory pathways . putative interaction sites and binding motifs in atranbpm amino acid sequence . to predict putative interaction sites and binding motifs elm _PROTEIN_ and sumosp _PROTEIN_ databases were used . the atranbpm coding sequence was cloned into gateway compatible plant binary vectors for n terminal _METHOD_ and c terminal _METHOD_ fusion . arabidopsis cell suspension cultures were transformed according to mathur et al . . transformed arabidopsis plants were obtained through the floral dip method . an antibody against a peptide from the c terminal part of the atranbpm molecule was produced in rabbits and affinity purified using the immunogenic peptide . when cell lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ atranbpm were analysed by western blotting of separated arabidopsis extracts the antibody recognized a band of kda the predicted molecular _METHOD_ of atranbpm and a band corresponding to the mw of _METHOD_ atranbpm . western blot further showed that the protein levels of atranbpm were much lower in arabidopsis seedlings than cell cultures . in cultured arabidopsis cells there was no significant difference in atranbpm protein levels between dividing cells and stationary growing non dividing cells . similarly there was no difference in atranbpm protein levels between four eight and day old arabidopsis seedlings . our data correspond to those on atranbpm _PROTEIN_ found in the publically available affymetrix _PROTEIN_ databases the arabidopsis _METHOD_ browser and the genevestigator database where atranbpm has a constant level of _PROTEIN_ in analysed tissues as well as during seedling development . cellular distribution of atranbpm and atranbpm complexes.a the antibody against atranbpm recognizes a band of kda which corresponds to endogenous atranbpm protein and a band of kda which corresponds to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ atranbpm from cultured cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ atranbpm . b comparison of protein levels of atranbpm in arabidopsis seedlings and cultured cells . lines and fractions from four eight and d old seedlings lines and fractions from exponentially growing cultured cells and stationary phase cultured cells . per line of protein content of fraction was loaded . c distribution of atranbpm in the cellular fractions of arabidopsis cultured cells . the majority of the protein was present in cytoplasm a small amount of the protein was found in pellet . atranbpm was spun down to high speed pellet probably in the form of complexes . d _METHOD_ atranbpm complexes from high speed supernatant and from immunoprecipitate were resolved by non denaturing _PROTEIN_ and detected by anti atranbpm antibody or anti _METHOD_ antibody as indicated . for fractions and of protein content was loaded . the cellular distribution of atranbpm was analysed using differential centrifugation . as shown in figure c the majority of the protein was cytoplasmic and only small amounts sedimented either in low speed pellets or in the microsomal pellet . the _PROTEIN_ that atranbpm was also sedimented from a high speed cytoplasmic extract to pellet indicated that the protein might be present in the form of higher mw complexes . the separation of high speed extract by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis _PROTEIN_ confirmed cell fractionation data and suggested that atranbpm is a component of protein complexes with a molecular _METHOD_ of around kda . further we immunopurified _METHOD_ atranbpm using the _METHOD_ trap . separation of purified _METHOD_ atranbpm by native _PROTEIN_ followed by western blotting showed the presence of complexes of similar size as observed when high speed supernatant was analysed . altogether these data showed that atranbpm is present predominantly in the form of large cytoplasmic complexes . to analyse putative interactors of atranbpm in the complexes _METHOD_ atranbpm and copurified proteins were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ followed by silver staining and specific bands were excised and analysed by maldi _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ immunopurification performed in extracts from wild type cell was used as a negative control . neither atranbpm protein nor bands corresponding to the mw of proteins copurified with _METHOD_ atranbpm were observed in the negative controls and only background contamination such as _PROTEIN_ and cytoskeletal proteins were detected by maldi _METHOD_ . we found that proteins reproducibly copurifying with atranbpm belong to ctlh domain containing proteins including lish cra and u box and to the transducin/wd domain containing proteins and . alternatively to maldi _METHOD_ we used lc maldi _METHOD_ analysis of eluates from the _METHOD_ trap to confirm the interaction of _METHOD_ atranbpm with the proteins mentioned above . proteins of ctlh complexes copurified with atranbpm fromarabidopsisextracts.a affinity purification of _METHOD_ atranbpm from the input of of _METHOD_ atranbpm culture using _METHOD_ trap a beads . proteins were eluted from affinity beads _METHOD_ and run on _PROTEIN_ gel electrophoresis with silver staining detection . maldi _METHOD_ analysis identified among proteins copurified with atranbpm the plant homologues of proteins that form ctlh complex in human cells . b comparison of proteins copurified with atranbpm with their counterparts the proteins of human ctlh complex . proteins copurified with atranbpm are members of ctlh complexes proteins copurified with atranbpm protein were identified by both maldi _METHOD_ and lc maldi _METHOD_ analysis . the values before and after the slash in the columns no . peptides and sequence coverage refer to maldi _METHOD_ and lc maldi _METHOD_ data respectively . homologues of human ctlh complex members reported by kobayashi et al. _PROTEIN_ proteins in the complex described by umeda et al . _PROTEIN_ yeast homologues in the gid complex published by regelmann et al . _PROTEIN_ . database search indicated that the proteins copurified with atranbpm were homologous to protein components of the human ctlh complex _PROTEIN_ . the ctlh complex is annotated in _PROTEIN_ as a complex with a putative function in regulating cell migration nucleokinesis chromosome segregation and microtubule dynamics . components of the ctlh complex are conserved amongst animal species and their presence is predicted for other eukaryotes such as plants and fungi . a relatively lower degree of homology with individual mammalian and plant members of ctlh complexes is due to the _PROTEIN_ that part of the molecule separating highly conserved domains contains insertions and deletions of various lengths differing among plant mammalian and/or yeast homologues . the lc maldi _METHOD_ analysis also identified among proteins copurified with atranbpm armadillo repeat containing protein . however the protein was not proven to be a homologue of the human armadillo repeat a member of the ctlh complex . further yippee family proteins and yippee like protein were copurified with atranbpm and identified by lc maldi _METHOD_ . yippee like proteins belong to the ypel family of proteins whose members have been described as interactors of the human _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . proteins and copurified with atranbpm were predicted to interact within a functional network in the aranet database . together these data suggest that plant atranbpm protein like its yeast and mammalian homologues is a component of a cytoplasmic multiprotein complex where it interacts with lish ctlh domain containing proteins and armadillo repeat containing proteins . in cultured cells of arabidopsis the _METHOD_ atranbpm signal was localized in the cytoplasm and in the perinuclear area of interphase cells with a weaker signal detected in _LOCATION_ . we observed no gain of function phenotype of arabidopsis seedlings _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ atranbpm from gateway vectors . similarly to cultured cells the _METHOD_ atranbpm signal was localized in the cytoplasm in _LOCATION_ and accumulated in the vicinity of _LOCATION_ in dividing zone of roots . in differentiated root cells _METHOD_ atranbpm was cytoplasmic and in the perinuclear area . c terminal _METHOD_ fusions showed a similar localization pattern when _PROTEIN_ transiently in cultured cells of arabidopsis . in vivolocalization of _METHOD_ atranbpm inarabidopsiscells and seedlings.a localization of _METHOD_ atranbpm in arabidopsis suspension culture . the protein is localized in the cytoplasm and in the perinuclear area . weaker signal is present in _LOCATION_ . b root tip of days old arabidopsis plant . weak cytoplasmic signal for _METHOD_ atranbpm is enriched in the perinuclear area . c cytoplasmic and perinuclear localization of _METHOD_ atranbpm in differentiated cells of root . bars . _METHOD_ analyses showed that the atranbpm protein was distributed patchily in the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ in non dividing cells it accumulated in the perinuclear region and in dividing cells the signal was slightly enriched in the area of the mitotic spindle and the phragmoplast . further we compared localization of the endogenous protein and _METHOD_ atranbpm by double labelling with anti atranbpm and anti _METHOD_ antibodies . we confirmed a similar localization pattern for atranbpm and _PROTEIN_ atranbpm with a cytoplasmic signal slightly enriched in the perinuclear area and a weaker _LOCATION_ signal . immunolocalization of atranbpm inarabidopsiscultured cells.a immunolocalization of endogenous atranbpm with affinity purified anti atranbpm antibody . signal for atranbpm was cytoplasmic with slight accumulation in the vicinity of _LOCATION_ and in dividing cells with slight enrichment in spindle and phragmoplast area . . b double _METHOD_ analysis of cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ atranbpm confirmed similar localization pattern for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein and for endogenous atranbpm protein _METHOD_ . c double _METHOD_ analysis of atranbpm and tubulin did not confirm colocalization of both proteins in interphase and in dividing cells . d double _METHOD_ of atranbpm and ran . only a small portion of atranbpm is localized in _LOCATION_ compared to intensive _LOCATION_ signal for ran protein . bars . to determine whether the atranbpm protein plays a role in microtubule organization like the truncated version of human _PROTEIN_ we studied the colocalization of atranbpm with the centrosomal protein tubulin . in acentrosomal plant cells tubulin is present with dispersed sites of microtubule nucleation in the cytoplasm with _LOCATION_ and on _LOCATION_ and microtubules . we found that the arabidopsis homologue atranbpm did not colocalize with tubulin positive sites either present with the _LOCATION_ envelope or on microtubular arrays . as a portion of _PROTEIN_ was reported to be associated with the ran protein in mammalian cells _PROTEIN_ we performed double _METHOD_ labelling of atranbpm and ran protein . in cultured cells of arabidopsis ran was localized in the cytoplasm and in _LOCATION_ but only a small fraction of atranbpm colocalized with _LOCATION_ ran .
