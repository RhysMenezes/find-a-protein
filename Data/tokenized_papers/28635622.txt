genes essential for gametophyte development and fertilization have been identified and studied in detail however genes that fine tune these processes are largely unknown . here we characterized an unknown arabidopsis gene _PROTEIN_ binding protein . is specifically _PROTEIN_ in ovule pollen and pollen tube . enhanced green _METHOD_ protein tagged localizes to both _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm and it also presents in punctate and _PROTEIN_ like structures . mutants exhibit no defect in gametogenesis and seed setting except that their pollen grains are pale in color . scanning electron microscopy analyses revealed a normal patterned but thinner exine on pollen surface . this may explain why pollen grains are pale . we next examined whether mutation affects post gametogenesis processes including pollen germination pollen tube growth and ovule senescence . we found that pollen grains germinated earlier and their pollen tubes elongated faster . emasculation assay revealed that unfertilized pistil _PROTEIN_ the senescence marker _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ one day earlier than the wild type pistil . consistently ovules and pollen grains of mutants showed lower viability than those of the wild type at to days post anthesis . together these data suggest that functions as a negative regulator of pollen germination pollen tube growth and gametophyte senescence to fine tune the fertilization process .
shares high similarity to the tobacco sperm cell _PROTEIN_ transcript . therefore we investigated whether gene is also specifically _PROTEIN_ in pollen grains . rt pcr analysis revealed that transcript was strongly accumulated in flower buds flowers and young siliques but was barely detectable in seedlings rosette and cauline leaves and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . our results are very similar to the publicly available _PROTEIN_ profile of the gene based on rna sequencing analysis _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . to investigate the _PROTEIN_ of in detail we generated gus transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ gus reporter gene under control of the promoter . consistent with the above results gus staining was only detected in flowers at developmental stages to and one day post anthesis and the gus signal was restricted to anthers and ovules _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in anthers gus signal was specifically detected in tapetum and developing pollen _METHOD_ . in vitro and in vivo pollen germination analysis showed that gus was also _PROTEIN_ in pollen tubes at high levels _METHOD_ . in ovules gus was _PROTEIN_ specifically in the embryo sac through stage _PROTEIN_ to the mature stage of _PROTEIN_ and its _PROTEIN_ was still detectable one day post anthesis _METHOD_ . to explore the subcellular localization of protein we generated transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ either a c terminal fusion of and enhanced _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ under control of the promoter _METHOD_ or a n terminal fusion of and _METHOD_ under control of the promoter _METHOD_ . consistent with the gus _PROTEIN_ patterns _METHOD_ was only _PROTEIN_ in tapetum developing pollen and ovule _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . during pollen development _METHOD_ signal was undetectable in pollen mother cell _METHOD_ then was detected in _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm of tetrad microspore _PROTEIN_ microspore and bicellular pollen _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . furthermore in bicellular pollen _METHOD_ signal was strong in the vegetative cell _LOCATION_ but was undetectable in the germ cell _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in mature pollen the _METHOD_ signal was _PROTEIN_ to below detectable level _METHOD_ . in in vitro germinated pollen tubes _METHOD_ signal was also undetectable . gus showed strong _PROTEIN_ in mature pollen and pollen tube . therefore to determine the localization of _METHOD_ in mature pollen and pollen tube we generated transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in mature pollen _METHOD_ signal was detected in _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm of the vegetative cell but was undetectable in the germ cell _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . this is consistent with the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _METHOD_ in bicellular pollen _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in pollen tube _METHOD_ was also only detected in the vegetative _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm _METHOD_ . furthermore the _METHOD_ localized to some punctate and _PROTEIN_ like structures in the _LOCATION_ of the vegetative cell _METHOD_ . during ovule development _METHOD_ signal was undetectable at developmental stage iii _METHOD_ then was first detected in megaspore mother cell at stage i _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ in functional megaspore coenocytic female gametophyte and mature embryo sac and also resided in _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ labeled punctate structures was also observed in cytoplasm of female gametophyte _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . we also examined the _METHOD_ signals in root tips of the _METHOD_ transgenic plants . we found that _METHOD_ also localized to both _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm of root cells and also resided in punctate and _PROTEIN_ like structures _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the identity of these structures remains to be elucidated . was reported to be the orthologous of the tobacco sperm cell _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . however unlike was not detectable in sperm cell _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . therefore we did amino acid sequence alignment of and . to our surprise these two proteins only share sequence similarity _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . we then searched the arabidopsis database using amino acid sequence and found that it shares similarity with the putative protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . to understand the function of arabidopsis we obtained t dna insertion mutant and ds transposon insertion mutant _METHOD_ . rt pcr analyses revealed that no transcripts were detectable in the inflorescence of homozygous and mutants _METHOD_ . there was no observable difference in vegetative growth between mutants and wild type plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . although was strongly _PROTEIN_ during pollen and ovule development _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ mutant showed no defect in pollen viability pollen development or seed set under standard growth conditions _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ except for its pollen grains exhibiting a pale yellow color compared with wild type _METHOD_ . to elucidate why pollen grains exhibited pale color we examined pollen surface by scanning electron microscopy _PROTEIN_ and confocal laser scanning microscope _PROTEIN_ . pollen grains displayed a normal patterned but thinner exine surface with thinner muri and larger lacunae compared with wild type _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . these results indicate that the gametophyte specific is not required for pollen viability and seed set but may play roles in post gametogenesis process such as pollen coat formation . to determine whether mutation affects post gametogenesis process we examined pollen germination in in vitro and in vivo environments . when cultured on pollen germination medium for hours pollen germinated as efficiently as wild type pollen _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . however pollen tubes were significantly longer than that of wild type _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . to analyze the growth of pollen tubes in vivo we pollinated wild type pistils with pollen grains from the mutants or wild type plant . at h after pollination wild type pollen tubes had just reached the top of the transmitting tract _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . by contrast pollen tubes had penetrated into the upper part of the transmitting tract _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . at hap majority of wild type pollen tubes were still in the upper part of the transmitting tract only a few pollen tubes turned toward ovules _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . by contrast pollen tubes reached more than half of the transmitting tract and most pollen tubes grew to entering the ovules _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . longer pollen tubes suggesting hyperactive germination or faster growth velocity . to determine the growth dynamics of pollen tubes we germinated pollen grains of wild type and plants in vitro for a series of time from to h. pollen grains of the mutants exhibited hyperactive germination _METHOD_ . for example at h approximately of and of pollen grains already exhibited pollen tube protrusion which was undetectable in wild type pollen grains _METHOD_ . at h approximately of and of pollen grains had germinated _METHOD_ . by contrast only approximately of col pollen grains and of ler pollen grains germinated _METHOD_ . although precocious pollen germination was not observed inside the dehiscing anthers in the morning in the afternoon long pollen tubes can be observed inside dehiscing anthers _METHOD_ . this phenomenon was not observed in the wild type anther _METHOD_ . we further recorded the in vitro pollen tube elongation by intervals of min and quantified its growth rate . the results showed that pollen tubes of the mutants elongated faster than those of the wild type _METHOD_ . taken together these results indicate that functions as a negative regulator of pollen germination and pollen tube growth . when observing the _PROTEIN_ of gus and _METHOD_ we noticed strong gus and _METHOD_ signals in aborted ovules _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . we then examined the _PROTEIN_ of gus in unfertilized pistils after emasculation . gus activity was detected specifically in the embryo sac at day post emasculation then gus signal was observed in the whole ovule at to dpe at dpe gus signal was absent in ovules located in the base of the pistil at dpe some apical ovules also lost the gus signal _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . this _PROTEIN_ pattern of gus in unfertilized pistil is opposite to that of senescence markers like _PROTEIN_ gus and _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . to determine whether mutation affect ovule senescence we crossed _PROTEIN_ gus into both of the mutants and the ler wild type plant . then we examined _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ in unfertilized pistils of wild type and mutants . in unfertilized ler wild type pistils _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ was first observed in the transmitting tract of the dpe pistils then it was detected in the ovules located in the base of the pistil at dpe finally gus staining was detected in all ovules of pistil at dpe _METHOD_ . whereas pistil of the mutant exhibited gus staining one day earlier than pistil of the ler wild type _METHOD_ . similar trend was observed for mutant . the above findings suggest that may have a role in ovule senescence . to test this we compared the seed set ability between and wild type after emasculation for to days . when pollinated at to dpe wild type and pistils produced comparable number of seeds _METHOD_ . however pistils produced significantly less seeds than wild type pistils when pollinated at to dpe _METHOD_ . these results indicate that ovule has a shorter lifespan than that of wild type plant . to examine whether mutation also affect pollen longevity we compared the fertilization efficiency of pollen grain with that of wild type after storage at for a series of time of to days . the results showed that pollinations using pollen grains produced less seeds than the ones using wild type pollen grains _METHOD_ . after stored for to days the difference between wild type and pollen grains were significant _METHOD_ . these results suggest that pollen grains are less viable than that of the wild type after long time storage .
