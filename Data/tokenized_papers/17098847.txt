upon encountering oxidative stress proteins are oxidized extensively by highly reactive and toxic reactive oxidative species and these damaged oxidized proteins need to be degraded rapidly and effectively . there are two major proteolytic _METHOD_ for bulk degradation in eukaryotes the proteasome and _LOCATION_ autophagy . in mammalian cells the proteasome and a specific type of _LOCATION_ autophagy chaperone mediated autophagy are involved in the degradation of oxidized proteins in mild oxidative stress . however little is known about how cells remove oxidized proteins when under severe oxidative stress . using two macroautophagy markers monodansylcadaverine and green _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ we here show that application of hydrogen peroxide or the reactive oxidative species inducer methyl viologen can induce macroautophagy in arabidopsis plants . macroautophagy defective rnai _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants are more sensitive to methyl viologen treatment than wild type plants and accumulate a higher level of oxidized proteins due to a lower degradation rate . in the presence of a _LOCATION_ h _PROTEIN_ inhibitor concanamycin a oxidized proteins were detected in the _LOCATION_ of wild type root cells but not rnai _PROTEIN_ root cells . together our results indicate that autophagy is involved in degrading oxidized proteins under oxidative stress conditions in arabidopsis .
although autophagy has been suggested to be involved in resistance to oxidative stress in yeast the function of autophagy during oxidative stress and whether plant cells also use autophagy as a defense against oxidative stress is unclear . in a previous study we characterized one marker for autophagy in arabidopsis the _METHOD_ dye mdc which specifically stains autophagosomes . to investigate whether oxidative stress can induce autophagy in arabidopsis we first examined the response of wild type plants to two well known oxidative stress inducers and mv . whereas can diffuse across _LOCATION_ and cause damage directly to cellular components mv acts by accepting electrons from psi in chloroplasts and then reacting with oxygen to produce superoxide . seven day old wild type seedlings grown on nutrient murashige and skoog _METHOD_ solid medium were transferred to the same medium plus mv for d or _METHOD_ solid medium plus mm for h then stained with mdc . numerous motile mdc stained autophagosomes were detected in root cells after mv or treatment observed by _METHOD_ microscopy . these mdc stained autophagosomes were absent from seedlings grown on control medium . these observations imply that autophagy can be induced by oxidative stress . proteins have been shown to associate with autophagosomes and _METHOD_ fusion proteins have been used as markers of autophagosomes in arabidopsis . to further confirm the mdc staining results we introduced a transgene _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ into wild type ecotype columbia plants . when grown on nutrient _METHOD_ solid medium _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was dispersed throughout the cytoplasm and punctate autophagosome like structures were not visible . when these transgenic _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants were transferred for d to solid _METHOD_ medium with mv numerous punctate structures were observed in root cells similar to the mdc stained punctate structures indicating the presence of autophagosomes . together these results strongly suggest that autophagy is induced by oxidative stress . the _PROTEIN_ protein is required for autophagosome formation in arabidopsis and its transcript is up regulated both during suc and nitrogen starvation and during senescence . rnai _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines with reduced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ show hypersensitivity to suc and nitrogen starvation and are unable to produce autophagosomes under these conditions . to analyze the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ under oxidative stress conditions total rna was isolated from wild type and rnai _PROTEIN_ seedlings after incubation with mv for up to h or in the absence of mv as a control and reverse transcription pcr was performed using primers specific for _PROTEIN_ . as shown in figure the transcript level of _PROTEIN_ increased after mv treatment in wild type seedlings . although this _PROTEIN_ increase was also seen in rnai _PROTEIN_ seedlings the level of _PROTEIN_ transcript is much lower than in wild type seedlings . to determine whether autophagosome formation is disrupted in rnai _PROTEIN_ root cells under oxidative stress d old rnai seedlings were transferred to solid _METHOD_ medium plus mv for d or plus mm for h then stained with mdc . compared to wild type seedlings fewer mdc stained autophagosomes were detected in the root tips of these rnai seedlings . both and mv treatment caused an increase in ros in wild type and rnai seedlings as measured by amplex red measurement of concentration indicating that the lack of autophagosome production in the rnai plants is not due to _PROTEIN_ production of ros in these plants . overall rnai _PROTEIN_ seedlings had higher ros levels than wild type possibly due to an increase in damaged organelles caused by the autophagy defect in these lines . these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ is not only required in starvation and senescence induced autophagy but also in oxidative stress triggered autophagy . to determine whether autophagy is required for the response to oxidative stress conditions growth of the rnai _PROTEIN_ lines was compared with wild type plants under oxidative stress . seven day old seedlings grown on nutrient _METHOD_ solid medium were transferred to medium with mv . mv strongly inhibited growth of both wild type and rnai plants . however after d rnai _PROTEIN_ plants were already chlorotic whereas wild type seedlings were still green . in contrast silencing of an unrelated gene by rnai had no effect on response to oxidative stress . these data imply that autophagy is necessary for plants to survive oxidative stress conditions . to assess whether the rnai _PROTEIN_ lines are likely to be under increased oxidative stress the _PROTEIN_ patterns of several ros scavenging enzymes were compared between wild type and rnai _PROTEIN_ seedlings . rna was extracted from seedlings after incubation in the presence or absence of mv for h followed by rt pcr analysis and quantification by densitometry . as expected in wild type seedlings transcript abundance increased in the presence of mv for each gene whereas it remained constant in control samples . in rnai _PROTEIN_ seedlings the transcript level was higher in each case than in wild type plants even in the absence of mv possibly suggesting that the rnai seedlings are under increased or constitutive stress compared with wild type . in the presence of mv the mrna levels for _PROTEIN_ apx and sod increased still further demonstrating that the rnai seedlings are still able to respond to increased ros concentrations . the _PROTEIN_ mrna level remained constant in the rnai lines and _PROTEIN_ transcript level _PROTEIN_ at _PROTEIN_ time points possibly reflecting different roles or differential regulation of cat _METHOD_ in response to oxidative stress . one result of oxidative stress is increased protein oxidation . to better understand the role of autophagy in oxidative stress the level of oxidized proteins was compared between wild type and rnai _PROTEIN_ seedlings after mv treatment . derivatization with dinitrophenylhydrazine was used as this assay is well established for use in plant _METHOD_ . seven day old seedlings were transferred to medium containing mv for up to h followed by isolation of total proteins . after derivatization of the _PROTEIN_ group of oxidized proteins with dnph immunoblotting was performed using dinitrophenol antibodies to detect oxidized proteins . the signal on the blot was quantified by densitometry of the entire lane of the gel . as shown in figure rnai plants accumulated approximately fold more oxidized proteins compared with wild type seedlings after mv treatment . similar results were obtained by quantifying either the entire lane or individual prominent bands with no evidence for selective increases in specific proteins . no signal was seen in parallel control experiments in which the dnp derivatization step was omitted . considering that rnai _PROTEIN_ seedlings are defective in autophagy these data indicate that inhibition of autophagy leads to increased accumulation of oxidized proteins during oxidative stress . we considered two possibilities to explain the increased accumulation of oxidized proteins in rnai _PROTEIN_ seedlings during mv treatment either an increased production of oxidized proteins or a _PROTEIN_ in their degradation . to distinguish between these possibilities we analyzed the effect of concanamycin a on the level of oxidized proteins after mv treatment . concanamycin a is a _LOCATION_ h _PROTEIN_ inhibitor which inhibits _LOCATION_ enzyme activities by increasing the internal _LOCATION_ ph and therefore prevents _LOCATION_ protein degradation . when treated with concanamycin a autophagosomes accumulate in the _LOCATION_ in arabidopsis roots as they can no longer be degraded . seven day old wild type seedlings were transferred to medium containing mv or concanamycin a or both mv and concanamycin a for up to h followed by protein isolation and immunoblotting using dnp antibodies . mv and concanamycin a treatment caused a significant increase in accumulation of oxidized proteins compared to mv treatment alone in wild type seedlings and this accumulation level is similar to that in rnai _PROTEIN_ lines when treated with mv . treatment of rnai _PROTEIN_ seedlings with mv and concanamycin a had no effect compared to mv alone indicating that the rnai and concanamycin a most likely inhibit the same protein degradation pathway . these data indicate that the increased accumulation of oxidized proteins in rnai _PROTEIN_ seedlings during mv treatment is most likely caused by the _PROTEIN_ in their degradation not by the increased production of oxidized proteins . to further confirm that the increased accumulation of oxidized proteins in rnai seedlings is caused primarily by reduced degradation of these proteins by autophagy the rate of degradation of oxidized proteins was compared between wild type and rnai plants . seedlings were treated with mv for d by which time oxidized proteins had accumulated to high levels in both wild type and rnai _PROTEIN_ seedlings . the seedlings were then transferred back to solid medium lacking mv and the degradation rate of oxidized proteins in wild type and rnai plants was compared . initially the amount of oxidized protein detected remained constant or increased slightly most likely due to the continued presence of mv in the seedlings even after transfer back to control medium . as shown in figure or d after transfer back to control medium the amount of oxidized proteins in wild type seedlings had _PROTEIN_ to a low level . in contrast rnai _PROTEIN_ plants retained a significantly higher level of oxidized proteins at this time point after transfer . together these data suggest that oxidized proteins can be transported to the _LOCATION_ for degradation by the autophagy pathway . in this way cells can eliminate oxidized proteins to increase their survival under severe oxidative stress . to further confirm that during oxidative stress oxidized proteins can be sent to the _LOCATION_ for degradation by the autophagy pathway the cellular localization of oxidized proteins caused by mv treatment was compared between wild type and rnai _PROTEIN_ root cells . three day old wild type and rnai _PROTEIN_ seedlings were transferred to medium containing concanamycin a to inhibit degradation in the _LOCATION_ or both concanamycin a and mv for h. the oxidized proteins were then derivatized in situ with dnp and detected using dnp antibody followed by _METHOD_ confocal microscopy . in the expanded root cells shown the _LOCATION_ occupies most of the cell volume and the cytoplasm is present as a thin layer adjacent to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . after treatment with concanamycin a and mv for h a strong dnp signal was detected inside the _LOCATION_ of wild type root cells . in contrast this dnp signal was absent from the _LOCATION_ of rnai _PROTEIN_ root cells and instead seen in the cytoplasm . this provides direct evidence that autophagy is responsible for transporting oxidized proteins to the _LOCATION_ for degradation under oxidative stress conditions .
