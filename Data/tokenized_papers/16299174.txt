biochemical and molecular characterization of the biotin biosynthetic pathway in plants has dealt primarily with biotin synthase . this enzyme catalyzing the last step of the pathway is localized in mitochondria . other enzymes of the pathway are however largely unknown . in this study a genomic based approach allowed us to clone an arabidopsis cdna coding keto aminopelargonic acid synthase the first committed enzyme of the biotin synthesis pathway which we named _PROTEIN_ . the function of the enzyme was demonstrated by functional complementation of an escherichia coli mutant deficient in kapa synthase reaction and by measuring in vitro activity . overproduction and purification of recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein enabled a thorough characterization of the kinetic properties of the enzyme and a spectroscopic study of the enzyme interaction with its substrates and product . this is the first characterization of a kapa synthase reaction in eukaryotes . finally both green _METHOD_ protein targeting experiments and western blot analyses showed that the arabidopsis kapa synthase is present in _LOCATION_ thus revealing a unique compartmentation of the plant biotin synthesis split between _LOCATION_ and mitochondria . the significance of the complex compartmentation of biotin synthesis and utilization in the plant cell and its potential importance in the regulation of biotin metabolism are also discussed .
searches of the arabidopsis genome database detected a single gene encoding a predicted protein with to identity to the protein sequences of e. coli and b. sphaericus kapa synthase _PROTEIN_ respectively . the product of this gene annotated as an aminotransferase class i and ii family protein and as an amino oxononanoate synthase like protein was designated _PROTEIN_ . the corresponding cdna was cloned by pcr amplification of a whole plant arabidopsis cdna library . sequencing and analysis of this cdna indicated that it contains a bp open reading frame encoding a amino acid protein for a predicted molecular _METHOD_ of d. this sequence is consistent with that predicted from gene model _GENE_ presented at the arabidopsis information resource web site and with the sequence of a full length cdna available on arabidopsis databases . alignment of the arabidopsis deduced protein sequence with that of prokaryotes revealed two features . first is the strict conservation of residues inferred to be crucial for substrate binding and catalysis from crystallographic and mechanistic studies of the e. coli and b. sphaericus enzymes . these residues are arg asn his and lys numbered according to the arabidopsis sequence lys being the _PROTEIN_ cofactor binding site . the second feature is the presence of an insertion of about residues in the n terminal region of the plant sequence compared to its bacterial counterparts . one should also note the report on arabidopsis databases of a splice variant of the _GENE_ gene . this cdna isolated at the _PROTEIN_ genomic sciences center _PROTEIN_ contains unspliced intron which introduces stop codons in the coding region . as a result this sequence is predicted to encode a protein of only amino acids the first initiating met corresponding to met of the larger form . this putative n terminus truncated form retains intact _PROTEIN_ binding domain but lacks regions conserved among all known kapa synthases particularly the essential amino acids arg and asn of complete _PROTEIN_ . therefore this shorter _PROTEIN_ form if it is actually produced is probably catalytically inactive . to test whether _PROTEIN_ is a functional enzyme the full length isolated sequence was cloned into e. coli _PROTEIN_ vector which allows low to moderate levels of protein production . this construct was used to transform an e. coli _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ which lacks kapa synthase activity and shows no growth on minimal medium unless biotin or a vitamer downstream pimeloyl coa is supplied . _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ protein restored the ability of the mutant to grow well without biotin . the growth of the complemented cells was similar to that of mutant cells supplemented with biotin . no complementation was seen with the vector alone . retransformation of the e. coli mutant with rescued plasmid containing the arabidopsis cdna from complemented cells restored biotin prototrophy further confirming that complementation was due to the encoded plant protein . taken together these data indicate that plant _PROTEIN_ has kapa synthase activity . to validate the results described above and to characterize further the plant kapa synthase reaction the complete _PROTEIN_ protein was overexpressed with an n terminal his tag using the plasmid and the e. coli host strain rosetta . when bacteria were grown under optimum overexpression conditions _PROTEIN_ was strongly _PROTEIN_ in soluble form . then the _PROTEIN_ protein was purified to near homogeneity by standard nickel affinity chromatography . typically to mg of pure enzyme was obtained from l of cell culture . the apparent molecular _METHOD_ of the native recombinant protein as estimated by gel filtration chromatography on a sephacryl column was found to be about kd which is close to the _METHOD_ of the enzyme subunit . these results are consistent with a monomeric structure of the recombinant enzyme in solution similar to that previously reported for kapa synthase from b. sphaericus but different from that of e. coli which crystallizes as a symmetric homodimer . purified _PROTEIN_ exhibited the characteristic yellow color observed for _PROTEIN_ containing enzymes . uv visible spectra exhibited peaks at and nm that could be assigned respectively to the noncoplanar and coplanar _METHOD_ of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ internal aldimine complex i.e . the schiff base formed between _PROTEIN_ and a lys residue in the protein . the stoichiometric ratio of _PROTEIN_ per enzyme subunit was determined by measuring the absorption of the cofactor at nm released on exposure of the native holoenzyme to alkaline conditions . by this method the average _PROTEIN_ content of the holoenzyme was found to be mol/mol of enzyme monomer . to investigate kapa synthase activity catalyzed by _PROTEIN_ in vitro we employed a colorimetric assay which relies on monitoring the release of coash from pimeloyl coa during the reaction using dithiobis . this assay formerly developed for measuring acetyl coa synthetase activity in the direction of acetate formation was more sensitive and reliable than published kapa synthase assay procedures for the e. coli and the b. sphaericus enzymes . under optimized assay conditions the pure overexpressed arabidopsis enzyme exhibited a specific activity of to nmol coash released protein . the reaction was strictly dependent upon the presence of l ala in the reaction medium and as expected from _PROTEIN_ stoichiometry measurements the purified holoenzyme was fully active even in the absence of exogenously added _PROTEIN_ . identification of kapa as a reaction product of the in vitro assay was confirmed by hplc analysis on a ion exchange column by comparison of its retention time value with that of authentic kapa sample and by its coelution with kapa standard in coinjection experiments . the recombinant arabidopsis kapa synthase obeyed michaelis menten kinetics with respect to pimeloyl coa and l ala . kinetic constants obtained compare well with those determined for the corresponding b. sphaericus enzyme but differ somewhat from those determined for the e. coli enzyme . particularly the km determined for pimeloyl coa was much lower than that for the corresponding e. coli enzyme indicating that the plant enzyme had a higher specificity for pimeloyl coa . steady state rate constants for arabidopsis kapa synthase kinetic parameters were determined by nonlinear regression analysis of the data to the michaelis menten equation . kapa synthase _METHOD_ together with aminolevulinate synthase ser palmitoyltransferase and amino oxobutyrate coa ligase a small subfamily of oxamine synthases . these _PROTEIN_ dependent enzymes catalyze condensations between amino acids and _PROTEIN_ acid coa thioesters with concomitant decarboxylation of the amino acid . to exclude the possibility that _PROTEIN_ actually encodes another enzyme of this family with kapa synthase side activity _PROTEIN_ the plant enzyme was assayed for substrate specificity . none of the amino acids tested except to some extent l ser acted as an alternate substrate to l ala for the reaction . similarly none of the coa derivatives tested among acetyl coa malonyl coa propionyl coa butyryl coa succinyl coa and palmitoyl coa could substitute for pimeloyl coa in the assay . furthermore none of these compounds inhibited significantly kapa synthase activity . also _PROTEIN_ did not show any aminolevulinate synthase ser palmitoyltransferase or amino oxobutyrate coa ligase activity . altogether these results confirm that _PROTEIN_ cdna encodes a functional kapa synthase with high substrate specificities . to complete the characterization of plant kapa synthase reaction we analyzed the spectral changes induced by the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with its substrates and product using uv visible spectroscopy . the increase in the absorbance of the nm band on addition of l ala was attributed to the external aldimine formation between _PROTEIN_ and the amino acid in the active site . plotting the absorption increase versus l ala concentration gave a hyperbolic curve with a dissociation constant kd of mm which is consistent with the km value of mm . this result is in broad agreement with those obtained for the corresponding b. sphaericus and e. coli enzymes . addition of pimeloyl coa to the external aldimine form of the enzyme resulted in the rapid formation of bands at and nm which _PROTEIN_ slowly over the course of several minutes . the formation of these bands was observed only after addition of pimeloyl coa to the enzyme already complexed with l ala . the appearance of the nm band implied formation of a quinonoid _PROTEIN_ intermediate whereas the nm band could be assigned to the product _PROTEIN_ complex as shown by incubation of _PROTEIN_ with kapa the end product of the reaction . biotin synthase the enzyme that catalyzes the final step in the biotin biosynthetic pathway was previously localized into the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ by both immunological and biochemical approaches . this raises the question of a mitochondrial localization for the whole pathway in the plant cell . however none of the subcellular targeting prediction _METHOD_ available and gathered on the web site http //aramemnon.botanik.uni koeln.de predicted a mitochondrial or a _LOCATION_ targeting for _PROTEIN_ . on the other hand the software program hmmtop detected a putative transmembrane domain in the c terminal region of the protein . to clarify the situation the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ was first investigated by fusing its full length sequence upstream to the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ marker protein . as shown in figure the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in arabidopsis protoplasts resulted in green _METHOD_ spread throughout the cytoplasm a pattern similar to the one observed with _METHOD_ alone but clearly distinct from punctuate patterns of green _METHOD_ observed with _METHOD_ fused to the transit peptide of the rubisco small subunit _METHOD_ or fused to the mitochondrial transit peptide of an authentic mitochondrial protein . these results strongly suggest that _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ protein . as a complementary approach we investigated the subcellular distribution of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis by western blot . intact chloroplasts and mitochondria from arabidopsis leaves were purified on percoll density gradients thus providing organelles devoid of contamination from the other compartments . also a _LOCATION_ enriched fraction was prepared . soluble proteins from purified chloroplasts mitochondria _PROTEIN_ and the _LOCATION_ enriched fractions were then analyzed . affinity purified antibodies raised against the recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein identified a kd polypeptide only in the total soluble protein extract and the _LOCATION_ enriched fraction . no labeling was revealed in _LOCATION_ subfractions . these results confirmed that _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ protein in arabidopsis .
