ethylene plays critical roles in plant growth and development including the regulation of cell expansion senescence and the response to biotic and abiotic stresses . elements of the initial signal transduction pathway have been determined but we are still defining regulatory _METHOD_ by which the sensitivity of plants to ethylene is modulated . we report here that members of the _PROTEIN_ gene family of arabidopsis previously implicated in the regulation of plant growth and _METHOD_ function as negative feedback regulators of ethylene signaling . _PROTEIN_ of all four members of the _PROTEIN_ family is induced by ethylene but this induction is blocked in ethylene insensitive mutants . the dose dependence for ethylene induction varies among the _PROTEIN_ family members suggesting that they could modulate responses across a range of ethylene concentrations . _METHOD_ fusions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ localize to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ the same subcellular location as the ethylene receptors and other initial components of the ethylene signaling pathway . seedlings with increased _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ family members exhibit reduced ethylene sensitivity based on physiological and molecular responses . these results support a model in which the _PROTEIN_ gene family functions as part of a negative feedback circuit to desensitize the plant to ethylene thereby expanding the range of ethylene concentrations to which the plant can respond . these results also indicate that the effects of the _PROTEIN_ gene family on plant growth and _METHOD_ are mediated through effects on ethylene signal transduction . the online version of this article contains supplementary material which is available to authorized users .
the primary success to date in identifying elements of the ethylene signal transduction pathway _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ has come through the employment of genetic approaches . we pursued an alternative approach to identify new ethylene signaling elements based on the hypothesis that many signaling pathways induce the production of negative regulators for the pathway a precedent in the ethylene pathway being the negative regulator _PROTEIN_ . to this end we examined microarray data for genes that are induced by ethylene or the ethylene precursor aminocyclopropane _PROTEIN_ acid and encode proteins with predicted transmembrane domain because these proteins could potentially be targeted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ where the initial signaling elements in the ethylene pathway are localized _PROTEIN_ . by this process we identified members of the _PROTEIN_ family _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which have been previously reported to regulate organ size with also identified as a gene induced in response to acc . the fourth member of the family is not present on the affymetrix _PROTEIN_ genome array . the phylogenetic relationship between members of the _PROTEIN_ family is given in additional file . all four members of the _PROTEIN_ family are induced by exogenous ethylene but the dose dependence for ethylene induction varies among the family members induction of the closely related _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ being most sensitive to ethylene . induction is blocked in the ethylene insensitive mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and reduced in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ is regulated through the well characterized ethylene signaling pathway . time course analysis indicated that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are rapidly induced by ethylene induction paralleling that of the ethylene receptor genes _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ .fig . induction of _PROTEIN_ family members . a ethylene dose dependency for induction varies

induced changes in _PROTEIN_ are reflected at the protein level we employed _METHOD_ fusions to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ driven from their native promoters . in response to exogenous ethylene both the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins are strongly induced the level of induction being even greater than that observed for the transcripts . upon removal of ethylene transcript and protein levels for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ rapidly drop demonstrating tight control of _PROTEIN_ by ethylene . dose response analysis demonstrated that their protein induction is

indicated ethylene concentrations for h. two immunoblot exposures are shown for the _METHOD_ fusions to allow for visualization of induction at low and high ethylene concentrations public microarray data indicates that only ethylene and auxin consistently induce _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ gene family members acc demonstrating a stronger effect than iaa . members of the _PROTEIN_ family were previously reported to be induced by auxin . however auxin stimulates ethylene biosynthesis raising the possibility that the effect of auxin on the induction of _PROTEIN_ gene family members might operate indirectly through the ethylene signaling pathway . to test this hypothesis we examined the effect the ethylene insensitive mutant _PROTEIN_ on the ability of auxin to induce _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and . auxin induced _PROTEIN_ of all three genes but this effect was eliminated by the ethylene insensitive mutant _PROTEIN_ . these results indicate that auxin induction of the _PROTEIN_ gene family is dependent on the ethylene signaling pathway . members of the _PROTEIN_ family contain two predicted transmembrane domains . prior analysis has suggested that members of the _PROTEIN_ family might be localized to _LOCATION_ cytoplasm _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and/or _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . we found that the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _LOCATION_ localized based on fractionation of transgenic plant lines into microsomal and soluble fractions . furthermore the fusion proteins are resistant to extraction from the _LOCATION_ by sodium chloride but can be solubilized from _LOCATION_ when treated with the detergent lysophosphatidylcholine . in this respect they are similar to the transmembrane ethylene receptor _PROTEIN_ consistent with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ being transmembrane proteins . although readily detectable by immunoblot analysis we could not detect _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ based on their _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in these stable transgenic lines . therefore to determine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we transiently _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ fusions in arabidopsis protoplasts . the resulting _METHOD_ co localized with the _LOCATION_ marker bip _METHOD_ . furthermore the _METHOD_ in the region underlying the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ exhibited the distinctive reticulate network appearance found with the cortical _LOCATION_ . no localization to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ itself was detected . thus both the co localization with bip and morphological features of the _LOCATION_ network support _LOCATION_ localization for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ consistent with results reported by feng et al . .fig . and _PROTEIN_ are _LOCATION_ associated proteins localized

affected ethylene sensitivity based on the growth response of dark grown seedlings to ethylene . wild type seedlings exhibit a pronounced reduction in hypocotyl growth when grown in ethylene . dose response analysis indicated that both the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ exhibit reduced ethylene sensitivity compared to wild type at concentrations ranging from to ethylene . since the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenes are _PROTEIN_ in the wild type background ethylene treatment will result in an overall heightened level of _PROTEIN_ family _PROTEIN_ compared to wild type due to the presence of the native gene and the transgene . these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ can function as negative regulators of the ethylene response . furthermore the finding that such a phenotype can be induced from the native promoter is suggestive that changes in _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ normally regulate ethylene sensitivity.fig . analysis of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in regulating ethylene sensitivity . a increased _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ in camv _PROTEIN_ lines and of _PROTEIN_ in camv

post test comparisons we tested the hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function as negative regulators by generating transgenic lines overexpressing these genes under the constitutive camv promoter . overexpression lines exhibited increased basal _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ in the absence of ethylene and resulted in higher than wild type _PROTEIN_ in the presence of ethylene . the ethylene sensitivity of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ overexpression lines was significantly reduced compared to wild type based on the dark grown hypocotyl growth response to ethylene . for comparison in this analysis we also included the ethylene insensitive mutant _PROTEIN_ which lacks this hypocotyl growth response to ethylene and the constitutive ethylene response mutant _PROTEIN_ which displays reduced hypocotyl growth in the both the absence and presence of ethylene . dose response analysis demonstrating reduced sensitivity of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ overexpression lines compared to wild type from to ethylene . a defining characteristic for _PROTEIN_ family mutants is their effect on plant _METHOD_ their overexpression resulting in increased leaf area these effects being attributed to changes in cell expansion and/or cell proliferation . ethylene insensitivity results in a similar increase in leaf area suggestive that effects of _PROTEIN_ family overexpression on _METHOD_ could be due to altered ethylene signaling . to assess the role of the ethylene signal transduction pathway in regulating cell expansion and cell proliferation we characterized fully expanded leaves of the ethylene insensitive mutant _PROTEIN_ and the constitutive ethylene response mutant _PROTEIN_ . as shown in fig . ethylene insensitivity results in increased leaf area due to an increase in both cell size and cell number . conversely the reduced leaf area found in _PROTEIN_ arises from a _PROTEIN_ in both cell size and cell number . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ results in increased leaf area consistent with prior studies this change being due to a significant increase in both cell expansion and cell proliferation . thus the changes in leaf area arising from altered _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ family are consistent with what is observed in mutants that affect ethylene signaling.fig . of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ recapitulate the effects on leaf cell

we examined ethylene dependent gene _PROTEIN_ . rna was prepared from seedlings grown in the dark in the absence or presence of ethylene because we observed substantial differences in the hypocotyl growth response under these conditions . five reporter genes we previously identified as robustly induced by ethylene were all induced in the wild type seedlings . the molecular response to ethylene was altered in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines . first the basal _PROTEIN_ of the reporter genes was reduced compared to wild type indicating a reduced response to endogenous ethylene in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines . second the _PROTEIN_ level of the reporter genes in response to ethylene was also reduced in the transgenic lines compared to wild type . thus overall we observed consistently reduced _PROTEIN_ for the reporter genes in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines.fig . of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ suppresses ethylene dependent gene _PROTEIN_ . a gene _PROTEIN_ was

protoplasts were co transfected with csv _PROTEIN_ or csv _PROTEIN_ constructs to determine their effect on the _PROTEIN_ of the luciferase reporters . protoplasts were treated in the absence or

biological replicates per sample treatment . statistical analysis was performed by t test with a bonferroni correction between the experimental samples and the corresponding wild type control we also examined the molecular response for four genes whose _PROTEIN_ is repressed in response to ethylene in wild type . effects of the transgenic lines on the ethylene repressed genes were less consistent than on the set of ethylene induced genes . however notably the basal _PROTEIN_ levels for both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were significantly higher in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines consistent with the response to endogenous ethylene in these lines being compromised such that they no longer suppress _PROTEIN_ of these genes effectively . as an alternative approach to examine the ability of _PROTEIN_ family members to inhibit ethylene dependent gene _PROTEIN_ we employed a transient protoplast assay with the ethylene inducible luciferase reporters _LOCATION_ luc or gcc luc _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . treatment of protoplasts with ethylene induces _PROTEIN_ of the luciferase reporters . however co transfection with either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ reduces the responsiveness of the luciferase reporter to the exogenous ethylene treatment . the basal level of _PROTEIN_ for the luciferase reporter is also reduced indicating that _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ reduces the response to endogenous ethylene . overall these molecular results reveal that the _PROTEIN_ family members function as negative regulators of the ethylene signaling pathway . we used time lapse imaging to examine the growth inhibition kinetics of hypocotyls from two day old dark grown arabidopsis seedlings . we have previously shown that application of higher concentrations of ethylene to wild type arabidopsis seedlings results in a rapid reduction in growth rate approximately min after application of ethylene with seedlings reaching a new steady state growth rate approximately min after ethylene addition . application of ethylene causes growth inhibition with kinetics that are initially indistinguishable from higher dosages . however approximately h after ethylene application desensitization is observed where the growth rate increases to a new steady state rate approximately of that observed in air . we obtained similar results with wild type seedlings in the current study . overexpression of either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ resulted in seedlings that initiated desensitization with a shorter delay and which reached a higher growth rate than wild type seedlings . these results indicate that changes in _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ family members modulate the seedling desensitization response to ethylene.fig . of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ accelerate the desensitization
