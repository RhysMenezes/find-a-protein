the arabidopsis thaliana pathogenesis related _PROTEIN_ is an important defense protein so far it has only been detected in _LOCATION_ space and its subcellular sorting and transport remain unexplained . using a green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged full length as well as a c terminus truncated version of _PROTEIN_ we observed that when _PROTEIN_ ectopically in nicotiana benthamiana leaves _PROTEIN_ co localizes only partially with _LOCATION_ markers and much more prominently with the _PROTEIN_ endosome _PROTEIN_ /multivesicular body _PROTEIN_ marker . the c truncated version _PROTEIN_ predominantly localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the same localizations were found for stable arabidopsis transformants with _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ driven by the native promoter . we conclude that the a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ undergoes an unconventional secretion pathway starting from the c terminus dependent sorting from the _LOCATION_ and utilizing further transportation via phosphatidyl inositol phosphate _PROTEIN_ p positive _PROTEIN_ like vesicles . the homology model of the _PROTEIN_ structure shows that the cluster of positively charged amino acid residues could indeed interact with negatively charged phospholipids of cellular _LOCATION_ . it remains to be resolved whether _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ localization reflects an alternative sorting or trafficking succession and what the role of lipid interactions in it will be .
as the _PROTEIN_ protein fused at the c terminus to _METHOD_ was transiently _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana we observed the _METHOD_ signal in compartments localized throughout the cytoplasm _METHOD_ . we have also designed a truncated version of _PROTEIN_ with deleted amino acids from the c terminus and fused it in frame again c terminally to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . we expected that this protein will be predominantly secreted outside the cell since it has no other known sorting signal . surprisingly the majority of the protein seemed to be retained in the _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ positive compartments are not observed in contrast to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . this is supported by the observation of a strong _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ signal in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ possibly coming from an over loaded _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . in order to confirm the presence of the _METHOD_ signal we have checked the emission spectra by a lambda scan mode _METHOD_ allowing us to distinguish between the real _METHOD_ signal and chloroplast _METHOD_ . the _PROTEIN_ positive compartments were found to be highly mobile and of variable shape with a diameter of approximately a few hundred nanometer up to one micrometer big _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ also indicates a possible occurrence of dilated subdomains of _LOCATION_ in transiently _PROTEIN_ n. benthamiana cells . as _PROTEIN_ was previously reported to be localized _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in order to better visualize cell wall _METHOD_ signal we subjected leaves to increased ph as well as to plasmolysis by a high concentration of mannitol or nacl . we observed a weak cell wall and a _LOCATION_ signal after the mannitol induced plasmolysis for both full length and c truncated _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . based on these observations we concluded that the _PROTEIN_ protein is localized to a vesicle like intracellular compartments and that localization into these compartments requires an intact c terminus in transient n. benthamiana cell _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is also localized adjacent to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and weakly into the apoplastic cell wall space . in order to uncover the identity of the _PROTEIN_ positive compartment we have performed co localization studies of full length _PROTEIN_ using red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged markers for _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ cis _LOCATION_ marker glycine max _LOCATION_ mannosidase _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ trans _LOCATION_ marker sialyl transferase _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ marker pectin methyl esterase _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ autophagy marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ p enriched early/late endosomal compartmental marker dsred _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ only weakly colocalized with the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . the overlap with the _LOCATION_ marker was partial and the majority of the signal overlapped with _PROTEIN_ positive compartment _METHOD_ . in some cases these compartments had obvious structure typical for presence of particles/vesicles within the vesicle _METHOD_ . unfortunately our time series scanning did not reveal any events resembling exosome secretion fusion with _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ nor endocytotic events _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . we performed the object based quantification of colocalization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with gm _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and dsred _PROTEIN_ . the highest proportion of the green signal overlapping with the red one was found for the combination of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with the dsred _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the _PROTEIN_ obviously does not share the secretion route with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . no distinct co localization with the _PROTEIN_ autophagy marker was observed _METHOD_ . even though transiently _PROTEIN_ proteins are found in cells affected by pathogen attack and have increased _PROTEIN_ of stress related _PROTEIN_ protein this situation does not seem to lead to a distinct increase of autophagy . in the cells observed the _PROTEIN_ signal is mostly cytoplasmic with only a few _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ positive autophagosomal bodies that had only partial co localization with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ positive vesicles _METHOD_ . the subset of markers was used for co localization with the truncated form of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which confirmed the previous observation that this version without the sorting signal contained in the c terminus is localized on the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . in order to describe _PROTEIN_ in situ in arabidopsis we have designed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs placed under the control of the native kb promoter and used it for the stable transformation of arabidopsis . without induction in seven days old seedlings almost no _METHOD_ signal was detected and after the sa induction of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in cotyledons we could see only a very weak signal in the case of the full length and slightly stronger for the truncated version of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in order to check for the proteolysis/degradation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ we have performed western blot analysis using antibodies raised against _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . we have detected high amount of endogenous _PROTEIN_ and significantly less of _METHOD_ tagged constructs . since the transgenic construct _PROTEIN_ is driven by the same promoter the _PROTEIN_ that the _PROTEIN_ levels differ indicates that either some distant positive transcriptional signals are missing in the transgenic _PROTEIN_ or the fused protein product is less stable than endogenous _PROTEIN_ . along some unspecific bands in higher protein _METHOD_ positions there were several weaker bands of smaller proteins found with both a _PROTEIN_ specific antibody that recognizes n terminal part of _PROTEIN_ as well as with an anti _METHOD_ body which recognized the intact c terminal part . these bands might come either from the antibody unspecificity but also could be signs of the presence of partially proteolytically processed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins . in any case both antibodies recognize well the full length vs. the c terminally truncated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion versions . using prolonged dark incubation in combination with sa treatment of seedlings we managed to improve the intensity of _METHOD_ constructs signal . this way we could detect the localizations which were in agreement with previous _METHOD_ on the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ bodies and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in a vesicles like compartment present in the cortical cytoplasm and also in the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . in order to further address the identity of _PROTEIN_ positive intracellular compartment we decided to use stable arabidopsis transformation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs driven by the promoter . this allowed us to obtain a stronger signal without the need to boost the _PROTEIN_ by sa which in high concentrations and prolonged incubations according to our bright field imaging significantly affected the appearance and physiology of cells . under the promoter in young seedlings the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was well detected _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ bodies like the compartment in cotyledons probably as an effect of overexpression but the presence of _PROTEIN_ compartments similar to those observed in n. benthamiana transient _PROTEIN_ was also detected _METHOD_ . the three dimensional reconstruction performed for cotyledon epidermal cells allowed the side view/optical cross section which showed that the _PROTEIN_ containing compartments are accumulated just beneath the outer surface _METHOD_ . bigger bodies observable in inner parts of the cells are _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ .
