_LOCATION_ trafficking to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ is a highly organized process which enables plant cells to build up their bodies . snare _PROTEIN_ genes which encode the proteins involved in _LOCATION_ trafficking are much more abundant in the arabidopsis genome than in that of any other eukaryote . we have previously shown that a large number of snare molecules in the arabidopsis cell are localized predominantly on the pm . in the present study in order to elucidate the physiological function of each pm localized snare we analyzed the spatiotemporal _PROTEIN_ profiling of nine that are resident in the pm of arabidopsis and used the information thus acquired to generate transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein fused qa snares under control of their authentic promoters . among the nine only _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ ubiquitously in all tissues throughout plant development . the _PROTEIN_ patterns of the other in contrast are tissue specific and all different from one another . a particularly noteworthy example is _PROTEIN_ which is predominantly _PROTEIN_ in root hair cells during root development and shows a focal accumulation pattern at the tip region of root hairs . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is involved in constitutive _LOCATION_ trafficking to the pm throughout plant development while the other are involved in _LOCATION_ trafficking events such as root formation or tip growth of root hair with some redundancy .
based on a phylogenic analysis of the snares found in green plants sanderfoot categorized the pm resident clade into two large groups and . the group is further divided into four distinct subgroups . up to five subgroups of qa snares may exist on the pm namely _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . using the genevestigator microarray database we analyzed the tissue specific gene _PROTEIN_ patterns of all group snares . as shown in supplementary fig . _PROTEIN_ is highly _PROTEIN_ in organs containing dividing cells such as root tip silique and shoot apex whereas its functional paralog _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ to a lesser degree throughout all tissues so far examined . the _PROTEIN_ subgroup qa snares _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ show similar _PROTEIN_ patterns but the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is slightly higher than that of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ root cap . _PROTEIN_ one of the _PROTEIN_ subgroup snares is predominantly _PROTEIN_ in particular root tissues including the elongation zone root hair zone and the _PROTEIN_ root . in contrast the other _PROTEIN_ subgroup snares _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ only in pollen . one subgroup snare _PROTEIN_ is also specifically _PROTEIN_ in pollen whereas _PROTEIN_ another member of this subgroup shows a ubiquitous _PROTEIN_ throughout all tissues . thus these pm qa snares are _PROTEIN_ differently among arabidopsis organs suggesting that these snares might have distinct functions in plant development . we generated transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fused pm resident snares under control of their native promoters and simultaneously observed the _PROTEIN_ patterns and subcellular localization with confocal laser microscopy . among the pm resident qa snare molecules five _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ in certain root tissues of day old seedlings . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ was detected exclusively in dividing cells in the root tip region . the majority of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ proteins were predominantly localized to the forming cell plates during cytokinesis although faint _METHOD_ signals were also observed on the intracellular punctate structures around the cell plate in the same cells . these punctate _METHOD_ signals partially overlapped with the _METHOD_ of an endocytosis marker indicating that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was localized to various punctate organelles including the _LOCATION_ and trans _LOCATION_ network as well as to the endosomes . no intracellular signals were detected in non dividing cells anywhere in the root tissues including the root tip . the localization pattern of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ observed here was completely consistent with the localization pattern of authentic _PROTEIN_ that was shown in an indirect _METHOD_ experiment . these results imply that our own promoter system revealed the precise subcellular localizations and tissue specific _PROTEIN_ of snare molecules throughout the plant body . in contrast to _PROTEIN_ with its characteristic restricted _PROTEIN_ pattern _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ ubiquitously in almost all cells in the root tissues including the root apical meristem epidermis cortex endodermis stele and root hair cell . although in non dividing cells the _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was only detected on the pm in dividing cells its _METHOD_ was also observed in _LOCATION_ punctate structures in addition to the cell plates . it has been reported elsewhere that pm localized qa snare molecules can be detected in positive endosomes accordingly we believe that the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ containing punctate structures we observed were the endosomes . _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ predominantly in the epidermal cells and _PROTEIN_ root cap cells in the root tip region . the _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ root cap cells observed with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ is consistent with the microarray data . the epidermal _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was observed in the whole root but the intensity of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ during root development . particularly in root hair cells _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was weaker in the differentiation zone where root hairs begin to develop . finally weak _METHOD_ signals were constantly observed in all types of cells in various tissues including the cortex endodermis and stele in addition to the epidermal cells in the mature root region . notably _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ formed patch like structures which were scattered on the pm in addition to its normal pm localization . longitudinal imaging of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the root showed that these patch like structures protruded slightly into the _LOCATION_ region from the pm . time lapse observation revealed that several of these dot structures of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ moved dynamically along the surface of pm whereas predominant _METHOD_ dots were less mobile on the pm . the _PROTEIN_ profile of _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ during root development was completely different from that of _PROTEIN_ . in the root tip region no _METHOD_ was observed in any cells examined . instead _METHOD_ _METHOD_ appeared in the endodermal cells at the differentiation zone . in the mature root region a weak _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was observed in the cortex and epidermis in addition to the strong _PROTEIN_ in the endodermal cells . thus the _PROTEIN_ patterns and intensities of these pm qa snares varied according to cell types in the root section although snares were uniformly localized to the pm of all types of cells in root so far examined . intriguingly the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is notably different from those of the other pm resident qa snare molecules described above . no _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was observed at the root tip region but after the root hair bulge rose at the differentiate region _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was specifically observed in the root hair cells . the high resolution _PROTEIN_ analysis of root tissues also revealed that _PROTEIN_ is enriched in root hair cells . although the _METHOD_ signals of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ continued to be visible in mature root hair cells their intensity was significantly reduced . no _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was observed in any other tissues not even in non root hair cells . it should be noted that once the root hair elongation began at the root hair cells _METHOD_ _METHOD_ accumulated predominantly in the pm of the developing root hair region especially at the tip of the root hair . image construction using reantlight software provided us with a clear view of the strong accumulation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ at the tip region of each root hair . this distribution pattern of _PROTEIN_ in root hair cells is obviously different from that of _PROTEIN_ . these data suggest that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is specific to root hair cells and that it might be involved in root hair elongation . next we observed the aerial part of each transgenic plant _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fused pm qa snares . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was specifically _PROTEIN_ and localized to the developing cell plates in the dividing cells during guard cell development which suggests that _PROTEIN_ might also be involved in the formation of guard cells . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were uniformly localized to the pm of epidermal cells in mature rosette leaves even in the absence of any fungal infection . _PROTEIN_ showed a strong steady state _PROTEIN_ in all rosette leaf cells throughout all stages of leaf development . in the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plant on the other hand clear _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was only observed in the epidermal cells of young rosette leaves . the intensity of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ attenuated gradually during leaf development and only faint signals of this snare remained in the mature epidermal cells of rosette leaves . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were also _PROTEIN_ in trichome cells of rosette leaves and the inflorescence stem . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of these _METHOD_ snares was observed uniformly on the pm of the cells . in the inflorescence stem _PROTEIN_ of the subgroup snares _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was restricted to the epidermal cell layer whereas the _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was observed not only in epidermal cells but also in mesophyll cells . no _METHOD_ _METHOD_ on the pm was ever observed in guard cells or trichome cells of wild type arabidopsis . in flower tissues the _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was detected in epidermal cells . strong _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was observed in epidermal cells around the top of the stigma while none was detected in the stigmatic papilla at flowering stage . in mature pollen grains _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ with clear pm localization although other which were _PROTEIN_ in vegetative tissues were not _PROTEIN_ in pollen grains . in contrast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were specifically _PROTEIN_ in the pollen grains . intriguingly these snares did not show clear subcellular localization patterns on the pm . instead faint _METHOD_ signals were observed throughout the cytoplasm of pollen grains . we compared these _METHOD_ signals with the _METHOD_ pattern of a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker monomeric red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in pollen grains and found that the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ not to be localized to particular organelle _LOCATION_ such as the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . intriguingly the _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localized to the tip region of pollen tubes during pollen tube elongation not to the cytoplasm of pollen grains . the localizations of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in growing pollen tubes are a little bit different . namely _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localized to the apical region of the pollen tube while _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localized to the subapical region of the tip . in contrast the _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localized uniformly to the _METHOD_ not only of pollen tubes but also of pollen grains . we examined the _PROTEIN_ patterns of _METHOD_ during embryonic development . only _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ in embryos at any stage of development . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was highly _PROTEIN_ in leaf primordia cells probably due to the high dividing frequency of the cells in this region . strong _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in the forming cell plates while relatively weak _METHOD_ was observed in the mature pm . meanwhile _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ showed constitutive _PROTEIN_ throughout the development of embryos and was localized uniformly on the pm of all embryonic cells . no other were _PROTEIN_ during the development of embryos .
arabidopsis thaliana ecotype columbia seeds were surface sterilized and grown on jiffy peat pellets for appropriate periods under continuous light at . for the observation of roots seeds were placed on _METHOD_ agar plates . after vernalization for d seeds were germinated under the conditions described above on vertically oriented plates . the translational fusions between _METHOD_ and the were generated using the _PROTEIN_ method described by tian et al . with some modifications . briefly for each about bp of an upstream region sequence with cacc an _METHOD_ sequence with a ggsg linker and an open reading frame followed by bp of a downstream sequence were each amplified separately by pcr . then the three dna fragments were conjugated in order using the triple template pcr method to form a single dna fragment which carries the orf with the _METHOD_ sequence at the end in tandem . in the case of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ about bp of an upstream region sequence followed by an _METHOD_ sequence was used for its construction . whole constructs were designed to _PROTEIN_ the snare molecule fused with _METHOD_ protein at the n terminus . the fragment was subcloned into pentr/d topo sequence verified and then transferred into a binary vector according to the gateway method . the sequences of primers used to generate constructs are listed in supplementary table . these constructs were introduced into agrobacterium tumefaciens strain subsequently arabidopsis wild type plants were transformed by the floral dipping method . screening of transgenic plants was performed on _METHOD_ plates containing ml hygromycin . lines which showed a segregation ratio of for antibiotic resistance were used for further experiments . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signals and differential interference contrast images were obtained using the nikon eclipse laser scanning microscope equipped with the ready confocal system and an argon laser . the endocytosis marker fm was treated for h before observation at a final concentration of and g l of propidium iodide solution was used to stain the cell wall . pollen germination was performed as described previously . the collected images were processed using nikon ez software . to examine the distribution of _METHOD_ in a surface model of a root hair was reconstructed from a series of confocal images and the intensities of _METHOD_ signals were mapped on the reconstructed model . as a preprocessing step to reduce the noise a gaussian filter was applied using imagej . the reconstruction and intensity mapping was performed according to the technique employed by kutsuna and hasezawa using reantlight software . once the models were reconstructed images were rendered interactively using paraview . microarray _PROTEIN_ analysis data for nine pm qa snares were obtained using the genevestigator microarray database and analysis toolbox . the genevestigator program is available on the web site at .
