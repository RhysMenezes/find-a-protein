mediated regulation of the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is crucial for pi acquisition and translocation in plants . because of a potential role for _PROTEIN_ in protein degradation and its association with _LOCATION_ an itraq based quantitative _LOCATION_ proteomic method was employed to search for components downstream of _PROTEIN_ . a total of proteins were identified from arabidopsis thaliana roots by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of which were predicted to contain at least one transmembrane helix . among the quantifiable proteins five were significantly differentially _PROTEIN_ between the wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant under two growth conditions . using immunoblot analysis we validated the upregulation of several members in phosphate family and phosphate transporter traffic _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ mediates the degradation of proteins . genetic evidence that loss of _PROTEIN_ or alleviated pi toxicity in _PROTEIN_ further suggests that they play roles as downstream components of _PROTEIN_ . moreover we showed that _PROTEIN_ interacts with in the postendoplasmic _LOCATION_ compartments and mediates the ubiquitination of endomembrane localized . this study not only uncovers a mechanism by which _PROTEIN_ modulates pi acquisition by regulating the abundance of in the secretory pathway destined for _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but also provides a database of the _LOCATION_ proteome that will be widely applicable in root biology research .
in order to minimize the complexity of proteome data and improve the detection of target proteins of low abundance we first examined in which cellular fraction _PROTEIN_ protein is preferentially located . by immunoblot analysis using the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody we detected the native _PROTEIN_ protein in the microsomal fraction isolated from the roots of the wild type but not from _PROTEIN_ . by contrast no signal was observed in the soluble fraction . in addition we observed an increased level of _PROTEIN_ protein in the _LOCATION_ but not the soluble fraction isolated from the roots of _PROTEIN_ overexpressing transgenic plants . as _PROTEIN_ is not predicted to possess any transmembrane helix domain our results showing _PROTEIN_ enrichment in the _LOCATION_ fraction suggest that _PROTEIN_ is a peripheral _LOCATION_ protein . our previous analysis of the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ by examining the c terminal _METHOD_ protein tagged _PROTEIN_ showed both reticular and spotted patterns . to confirm this we further examined the colocalization of the n terminal _METHOD_ protein tagged _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts and performed statistical analysis of the subcellular colocalization of _PROTEIN_ and several subcellular markers . similarly to the c terminal _METHOD_ protein tagged _PROTEIN_ the n terminal _METHOD_ fusion protein was not observed at the pm or tonoplast . while the reticular pattern of _PROTEIN_ signal largely overlapped with the signals from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ markers at _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the punctate signal of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ colocalized with the markers for _LOCATION_ but to a lesser extent with the markers for the trans _LOCATION_ network early endosomes and _PROTEIN_ endosomes . hence we conclude that _PROTEIN_ is a peripheral _LOCATION_ protein predominately associated with the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . interestingly although both the n and c terminal _METHOD_ protein fusions of _PROTEIN_ are functional proteins capable of complementation of _PROTEIN_ by reducing the shoot pi concentration when _PROTEIN_ under its native promoter we failed to observe a _METHOD_ signal for _PROTEIN_ in these complemented lines . the difficulty of detection of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions in planta has also been reported even when the inducible system was used . we speculate that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein may be present at a very low level below the detection limit owing to its rapid protein degradation and this possibility remains to be further examined . given the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ and potential engagement of _LOCATION_ proteins in _PROTEIN_ mediated activities we focused on the comparison analysis of the _LOCATION_ proteomes of the wild type and _PROTEIN_ by applying the method that we previously developed based on gel assisted digestion isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation technology combined with off line two dimensional liquid chromatography tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . since the function of _PROTEIN_ in the root is responsible for the pi toxicity phenotype root samples were used for analysis . the d old and d old roots grown under solid agar and hydroponic media containing were collected for isolation of _LOCATION_ proteins . the elevated pi level in the shoots of _PROTEIN_ was confirmed for both growth regimes . after gel assisted digestion peptides from different samples were extracted and labeled with itraq reagents combined and separated by strong cation exchange chromatography into fractions . each strong cation exchange fraction was desalted and analyzed in duplicate by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . three biological replicates were conducted for each growth condition . the raw data generated from the liquid chromatography _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis were processed to detect _METHOD_ peaks using uniqua followed by the protein identification and quantification using mascot version _PROTEIN_ . the processed spectra were searched against the database . details of the liquid chromatography _METHOD_ _METHOD_ data processing are described in the supplemental methods online . after combining total protein of four samples _PROTEIN_ from three biological replicates we identified peptide spectra corresponding to proteins with confidence . next we employed various tools to annotate the _LOCATION_ proteins identified . first transmembrane hidden markov model server version algorithm was used to predict the proteins containing transmembrane helices . a total of proteins were predicted to contain at least one transmembrane helix and are likely to be integral _LOCATION_ proteins . in addition subcellular localization was classified using the gene ontology database and _PROTEIN_ . the posttranslational modifications associated with _LOCATION_ anchoring such as myristoylation palmitoylation prenylation and glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors were also predicted . collectively these analyses yielded _LOCATION_ or putative _LOCATION_ proteins . to increase confidence for those proteins without a transmembrane helix we considered the prediction reliable only if the protein was present in at least two analyses . using this principle a total of proteins were classified as _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ associated proteins . as the genome frequency of annotated _LOCATION_ proteins predicted by tmhmm and go is and respectively our results displayed a higher frequency of annotated _LOCATION_ proteins suggesting enrichment of _LOCATION_ proteins in our analysis . nevertheless validation of _LOCATION_ localization for those noncharacterized proteins will be required . furthermore we searched our data set against the most updated database of proteomic and green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ localization sets in _PROTEIN_ and observed that proteins do not exist in the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ database and therefore likely represent newly identified proteins . identification of such large numbers of _LOCATION_ proteins demonstrated the depth of our data set and the uniqueness of our methodology . the detailed descriptions including the protein scores and _METHOD_ annotation predicted transmembrane helices and quantification for the proteins identified are listed in supplemental data set online . we next subjected the identified proteins to go analysis . several go _METHOD_ were significantly enriched including catalytic activity transferase activity transporter activity and anion binding in the molecular function category as well as cellular process localization transport and establishment of localization in the biological process category . many of these categories are tightly associated with _LOCATION_ proteins . for quantitative proteomic comparison between the wild type and _PROTEIN_ roots a total of proteins with at least two identified peptides were quantified . among them proteins were identified from all three biological replicates and subjected to statistical analysis by one tailed student s t test . we considered the difference in protein amount to be significant when the p value was < and there was at least a fold change . using these criteria we identified and proteins differentially _PROTEIN_ between the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ roots grown in solid agar and in hydroponic culture respectively . we found five proteins displaying a reproducible trend of change across the two different samples grown in the solid agar and hydroponic _METHOD_ in all three biological replicates . among them three proteins were upregulated and two were downregulated in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the protein levels of several pi transporters and in the family were increased in the _PROTEIN_ roots . members of the family localize to the pm and are thought to account for pi uptake directly from the rhizosphere . when examining other annotated pi transporters or pi transport related proteins in the list we found that and _PROTEIN_ proteins were upregulated in the agar grown _PROTEIN_ roots yet did not show significant changes in the hydroponic samples . _PROTEIN_ functions to facilitate the exit of protein out of the _LOCATION_ and subsequent targeting to the pm . because the upregulation of and _PROTEIN_ proteins may be closely associated with the increased pi uptake activity in _PROTEIN_ mutants we analyzed and _PROTEIN_ along with other pi transporters in the following analyses . it is worth noting that although _PROTEIN_ was identified only in the third biological replicate its amount was increased in _PROTEIN_ roots grown under both growth conditions . this result _METHOD_ our previous finding that _PROTEIN_ directs the degradation of _PROTEIN_ . next we investigated whether the alteration in protein abundance in _PROTEIN_ resulted from changes in gene _PROTEIN_ at the transcript level . by quantitative rt pcr analysis we found that the transcriptional levels of and were increased in younger seedlings likely attributable to the low pi concentration in the roots of younger seedlings of _PROTEIN_ . a detailed comparison between the transcript and protein levels of in hydroponically grown older seedlings is described below . to examine whether the increased levels of and _PROTEIN_ proteins are responsible for pi toxicity of _PROTEIN_ we employed genetic approaches by analyzing the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants . in contrast with the elevated pi concentration of the _PROTEIN_ shoots the and _PROTEIN_ single mutants displayed reduced shoot pi concentrations compared with the wild type . introduction of the mutation of or _PROTEIN_ into _PROTEIN_ giving rise to the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant significantly reduced the shoot pi concentration of _PROTEIN_ by or respectively . compared with loss of function of _PROTEIN_ had a greater impact on reduction of shoot pi in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the shoot pi level in the _PROTEIN_ mutant was also lower than that of the mutant . this could be attributed to the regulatory role of _PROTEIN_ in controlling the _PROTEIN_ of multiple proteins besides . interestingly _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants had higher shoot pi concentrations than the respective and _PROTEIN_ single mutants suggesting that additional _PROTEIN_ such as other members revealed by our quantitative proteomic data or _PROTEIN_ homologs may contribute to shoot pi accumulation of _PROTEIN_ . taken together the genetic interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ and supports the role of _PROTEIN_ and in contributing to the high shoot pi level of _PROTEIN_ . to investigate to what extent the other major members and may contribute to the phenotype of _PROTEIN_ we generated the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ double mutants generation of _PROTEIN_ by crossing is not feasible because of the close proximity of the and _PROTEIN_ genes on chromosome . under pi sufficient conditions we found that the shoot pi concentrations were _PROTEIN_ < _PROTEIN_ < _PROTEIN_ indicating that makes a greater contribution than or to the pi accumulation in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . this may be explained by a much higher transcript level of relative to and when pi is adequate . based on the previously observed increased mrna level of and in _PROTEIN_ roots it was postulated that and are downstream components of _PROTEIN_ that contribute to pi toxicity of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . we did not identify these two proteins as candidates in our proteomic analysis and decided to examine their possible involvement using a genetic approach . under pi sufficient conditions the and single mutants did not display any apparent phenotype distinguishable from the wild type and had similar shoot pi levels as the wild type . notably the shoot pi concentrations of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants remained as high as that of _PROTEIN_ . this result strongly argues against the involvement of and in the _PROTEIN_ regulatory pathway . we speculate that the upregulation of and transcripts is likely a result of secondary effects . in order to validate the results obtained from _LOCATION_ proteomics we raised antibodies against and _PROTEIN_ using synthetic peptides . because of the high amino acid sequence similarity among and a common peptide was used to generate an antibody recognizing all three of them . the protein signals detected by immunoblot using these antibodies are specific because signals corresponding to the same size of protein in the t dna insertion mutants were not detected _PROTEIN_ or reduced compared with wild type plants . consistent with the data from quantitative _LOCATION_ proteomics of d old seedlings we found that the protein levels of and _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ roots were higher than those in the wild type controls under pi sufficient conditions . the increased amount of proteins in _PROTEIN_ is in agreement with our previous observation of the increased vmax of pi uptake activity in _PROTEIN_ . under pi deficient conditions the amounts of these proteins were increased compared with the pi sufficient conditions and the level was similar in _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants . in other words the increase of these proteins in _PROTEIN_ was observed only under pi sufficient conditions the differences between _PROTEIN_ and the wild type became negligible when pi was limited . this is in line with our previous finding that the difference of pi uptake activity between _PROTEIN_ and the wild type was drastic only under pi sufficient conditions . it has been shown that suppression of _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ under pi deficiency is reversed when pi is resupplied to the medium . to examine the role of _PROTEIN_ in regulating the accumulation of and _PROTEIN_ proteins upon pi resupply we examined the _PROTEIN_ of these proteins following d of pi replenishment after d of pi starvation . while the increased amounts of proteins and _PROTEIN_ were comparable between the wild type and _PROTEIN_ after the eighth day of starvation a more rapid reduction of these proteins was observed in wild type plants than in _PROTEIN_ mutants after pi replacement . this suggests that _PROTEIN_ plays a role in downregulating the accumulation of these proteins once the pi starved plants sense the adequate resupply of pi . in order to elucidate the role of _PROTEIN_ in downregulating the protein level of and _PROTEIN_ we compared the mrna and protein levels of and _PROTEIN_ concurrently in the same sample of roots . in addition because of the ambiguity resulting from transcriptional activation by reduced pi concentrations in the roots of young _PROTEIN_ seedlings we focused on the analysis of hydroponically grown older seedlings whose root pi concentrations were comparable between the wild type and _PROTEIN_ . while the mrna levels of and showed no difference between wild type and _PROTEIN_ roots these proteins increased significantly in the _PROTEIN_ root . because the transcript level of was much higher than those of and the protein signal detected by anti antibody in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ may be contributed _PROTEIN_ by . interestingly the protein signals detected by anti antibody in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ double mutants remained relatively high when compared with the and single mutants respectively supporting that _PROTEIN_ mediates the protein abundance of more than one member as revealed by proteomic analysis . it is also worthwhile to mention that the signal detected by the anti antibody in the was stronger than in the wild type . we suspected that this might result from upregulation of and in compensation for the loss of . however such effect _METHOD_ to be developmental stage dependent because it was not observed in younger seedlings . consistent with the proteomics result immunoblot analysis of showed no difference between the wild type and _PROTEIN_ in the hydroponically grown samples . however more protein was accumulated in the _PROTEIN_ than without any significant changes of the transcript level . additionally without the elevated transcript level we also detected an increase in _PROTEIN_ proteins in _PROTEIN_ compared with . on the basis of this comparison we conclude that _PROTEIN_ regulates the _PROTEIN_ of and likely _PROTEIN_ as well at the protein level . we next examined the protein stability of and _PROTEIN_ by applying cycloheximide an inhibitor of protein translation to wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings grown under pi sufficient conditions . the _PROTEIN_ of and _PROTEIN_ proteins in the root was examined at and h after chx treatment . notably the chx treatment resulted in a more rapid decline of and proteins in the wild type than in _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ posttranslationally regulates these proteins probably via degradation . the half life of and is estimated to be h in the wild type plant . by contrast the degradation rate of and in _PROTEIN_ was much slower . to our surprise the _PROTEIN_ protein was not affected by h of chx treatment in either wild type or _PROTEIN_ plants . we speculate that either _PROTEIN_ proteins are relatively stable or degradation of a negative regulator of _PROTEIN_ during chx treatment is involved . because of the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ compartments through which pass prior to their final destination of the pm we next examined the physical interaction between these proteins . bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation in tobacco leaves using agrobacterium tumefaciens infiltration and the split ubiquitin yeast two hybrid system were employed . to prevent protein degradation presumably mediated by the ubiquitin conjugase activity of _PROTEIN_ we generated a _PROTEIN_ variant _PROTEIN_ with a mutation in the conserved catalytic cys residue in the ubc domain . when the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and or was examined the reconstitution of yellow _METHOD_ protein signal was observed as intracellular dots only when coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ while no signal was observed in the corresponding negative controls . this indicated that _PROTEIN_ is in close proximity to these hinting at a possible physical interaction . a previous study showed that coexpression of _PROTEIN_ with in agrobacterium infiltrated tobacco leaves is critical to enhancing or stabilizing the _PROTEIN_ of as well as facilitating its targeting to the pm . it is possible that _PROTEIN_ mediated _LOCATION_ exit of the is a prerequisite to the potential interaction of _PROTEIN_ with the at the post _LOCATION_ compartments . the interaction of _PROTEIN_ and was also validated by the split ubiquitin system . unfortunately we were unable to confirm the interaction of _PROTEIN_ and in yeast cells for unknown reasons . we also attempted to examine the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but we could not draw any conclusion because of inconsistent results . instead we detected the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and the in both bifc and analyses which corroborates the role of _PROTEIN_ in facilitating targeting of to the pm . the observation of interaction of _PROTEIN_ and the in the _LOCATION_ was consistent with the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ and its function in assisting the exit of out of the _LOCATION_ . to examine whether _PROTEIN_ mediates ubiquitination of the we attempted to detect in vivo ubiquitinated proteins following immunoprecipitation . total _LOCATION_ proteins isolated from the pi replete roots of d old wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings were subjected to immunoprecipitation analysis . whereas immunoprecipitation using anti antibody was successful anti and anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies produced low signal or high background after immunoprecipitation . when probed with the antiubiquitin antibody the immunoprecipitated proteins showed a smear pattern at the higher molecular weights in the wild type sample indicating that the presence of polyubiquitinated or multimonoubiquitinated . as the smeared signal was diminished in the samples of and _PROTEIN_ loss of greatly contributed to the reduced intensity . the remaining signal in and _PROTEIN_ may result from the ubiquitination of and . interestingly we did not observe a reduction in the level of ubiquitinated in _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type . considering that the em rather than the pm is the location where _PROTEIN_ interacts with the we separated the total microsomal _LOCATION_ into pm and em fractions for immunoprecipitation analysis . the pm and em fractions were separated and enriched as shown by immunoblot using their respective protein markers . whereas the protein level of was increased in both the pm and em fractions of _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type the level of ubiquitinated protein was moderately _PROTEIN_ in the em but not in the pm of _PROTEIN_ . when we normalized the intensity of ubiquitination signals in the pm and em fractions of the wild type or _PROTEIN_ with the corresponding protein level of a more prominent reduction of ubiquitination of was detected in the em of _PROTEIN_ than in the pm . these results support the notion that _PROTEIN_ mediates the ubiquitination of at the em rather than the pm . we reasoned that the ubiquitination of in the pm of _PROTEIN_ is independent of _PROTEIN_ because of the absence of _PROTEIN_ in the pm . it is possible that other unidentified _PROTEIN_ in the pm are involved in the augmented ubiquitination of to compensate for the loss of _PROTEIN_ activity in the em as the excessive pi accumulates throughout the growth of _PROTEIN_ . to minimize this secondary effect we analyzed the root samples from much younger seedlings . as expected the ubiquitination of was clearly reduced in total _LOCATION_ isolated from _PROTEIN_ . altogether these results reveal a role for _PROTEIN_ in mediating the ubiquitination of in the em compartment where _PROTEIN_ and the interact .
