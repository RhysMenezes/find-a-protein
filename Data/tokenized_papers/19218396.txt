glutaredoxins _PROTEIN_ have thus far been associated _PROTEIN_ with redox regulated processes participating in stress responses . however _PROTEIN_ encoding a _PROTEIN_ has recently been shown to regulate _PROTEIN_ primorida initiation and further _PROTEIN_ morphogenesis in arabidopsis thaliana . _PROTEIN_ belongs to a land plant specific class of _PROTEIN_ that has a cc type active site motif which deviates from ubiquitously occurring _PROTEIN_ and cgfs _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ studies of yellow _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ fusion genes driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter reveal a nucleocytoplasmic distribution of _PROTEIN_ . we demonstrate that _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ is indispensable and thus crucial for its activity in flower development . yeast two hybrid screens identified tga transcription _PROTEIN_ as interacting proteins which was confirmed by bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation experiments showing their _LOCATION_ interaction in planta . overlapping _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ and tga genes during flower development demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ protein interactions can occur in vivo and support their biological relevance in _PROTEIN_ development . deletion analysis of _PROTEIN_ demonstrates the importance of the c terminus for its functionality and for mediating _PROTEIN_ protein interactions . phenotypic analysis of the _PROTEIN_ pan double mutant and an engineered chimeric repressor mutant from perianthia _PROTEIN_ a floral tga gene supports a dual role of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ development . together our results show that the _PROTEIN_ protein functions in the _LOCATION_ likely by modifying _PROTEIN_ posttranslationally and thereby regulating its activity in _PROTEIN_ primordia initiation . additionally _PROTEIN_ affects _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ morphogenesis probably by modulating other tga _PROTEIN_ that might act redundantly during differentiation of second whorl organs .
information about intracellular localization of _PROTEIN_ is scarce . for plant _PROTEIN_ or cgfs _PROTEIN_ it has been reported that _LOCATION_ and chloroplastic activities are implicated in the assembly and delivery of iron sulfur clusters . given the function of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ primordia initiation and morphogenesis we were interested in determining where this land plant specific cc type _PROTEIN_ exerts its function within the cell . yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ was fused to the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ . the construct was transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaf epidermal cells under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter and then monitored by capturing _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was localized in the _LOCATION_ and also in the cytoplasm . availability of a characteristic _PROTEIN_ phenotype in the _PROTEIN_ mutant which produces only instead of _PROTEIN_ on average allowed us to determine the complementation capacity of this fusion protein in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants _PROTEIN_ the fusion gene . eighty nine percent of the analyzed transgenic plants formed four wild type _PROTEIN_ proving that the nucleocytoplasmic _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is capable of rescuing the _PROTEIN_ phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . this also demonstrates that n terminal fusions to _PROTEIN_ do not disrupt its function . to discriminate between _LOCATION_ and cytoplasmic contributions to the _PROTEIN_ function we generated fusion proteins of _PROTEIN_ that are either localized in the _LOCATION_ or excluded from it and accumulate in the cytoplasm . a _LOCATION_ localization signal derived from the large t antigen which has been shown to be functional in plant cells was fused to the n terminus of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ yielding nls _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . this fusion protein was detectable exclusively in the _LOCATION_ . indeed this _LOCATION_ localization is sufficient to mediate a wild type like _PROTEIN_ activity that complements the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ phenotype . out of the transgenic plants examined plants developed wild type _PROTEIN_ . exclusive localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein in the cytoplasm was achieved by cloning three _METHOD_ fragments _METHOD_ in frame upstream of _PROTEIN_ generating _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . strikingly the restricted localization to the cytoplasm disturbed the capability to complement the _PROTEIN_ mutant . fifty eight plants were investigated and all showed the _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ phenotype with a reduced number of _PROTEIN_ and the occurrence of _PROTEIN_ abnormalities such as formation of smaller or folded _PROTEIN_ . however functionality of this large fusion protein could be proven . the generation of an nls _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct allowed us to redirect this _PROTEIN_ fusion protein exclusively to the _LOCATION_ and as a consequence restored its potential to rescue the _PROTEIN_ development of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . among the analyzed transgenic lines lines formed wild type _PROTEIN_ . collectively these results show that in contrast with other intracellular localization studies of _PROTEIN_ and cgfs _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ activity of the cc type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is required and sufficient to regulate normal _PROTEIN_ development . intrigued by the finding that _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ activity is crucial for flower development we aimed to identify target proteins that interact with _PROTEIN_ . a yeast two hybrid screen was conducted using _PROTEIN_ as bait to isolate interaction partners from a prey library containing arabidopsis cdnas . sequence analysis of interacting partners led to the identification of four cdnas encoding _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively which all belong to the family of tga transcription _PROTEIN_ for whose members _LOCATION_ activity has been demonstrated . retransformation of these prey cdnas into the bd _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ yeast strain further confirmed that truncated versions of tga _PROTEIN_ interacted with _PROTEIN_ . moreover in the absence of _PROTEIN_ none of the transformants grew on selection medium . similarly the bd _PROTEIN_ containing yeast strain did not grow on selection medium without tga _PROTEIN_ . the arabidopsis genome contains tga genes and eight of them _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ have been further investigated . full length cdnas for these eight tga _PROTEIN_ were cloned into behind the gal ad domain and transformed into the bd _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ yeast strain . prototrophic growth was observed when coexpressing _PROTEIN_ with any of the tga genes tested . moreover _PROTEIN_ protein was found to interact differentially with tga _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ showed a strong affinity for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ an intermediate affinity for _PROTEIN_ and a weak affinity for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . interactions of wild type or mutagenized _PROTEIN_ with tga _PROTEIN_ revealed by yeast two hybrid screens to further investigate the interactions of _PROTEIN_ with tga _PROTEIN_ in planta the bifc technique was employed . for bifc experiments the n terminus of _METHOD_ was cloned upstream of _PROTEIN_ . the c terminus of _METHOD_ was fused n and c terminally in frame to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ individually . by conducting agrobacterium tumefaciens coinfiltration constructs were pairwise transiently _PROTEIN_ in abaxial epidermal cells of tobacco leaves . reconstitution of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was examined by confocal microscopy to d after transient coexpression of protein pairs . yellow _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ was detected for coexpression of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of the two tested fusion orientations for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . no yellow _METHOD_ was observed when coexpressing _PROTEIN_ and each of the other tga _PROTEIN_ that showed only a weak interaction in the yeast two hybrid experiments . as negative controls coexpression of nonfused yn with nonfused yc or one of the fusion proteins with nonfused yn or nonfused yc failed to reconstitute a _METHOD_ _METHOD_ chromophore . the in planta _LOCATION_ interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ together with the finding that the _LOCATION_ activity of _PROTEIN_ is crucial for its function suggests that this cc type _PROTEIN_ might modify tga _PROTEIN_ posttranslationally in the _LOCATION_ . all _PROTEIN_ share a conserved thioredoxin fold . in addition all arabidopsis cc type _PROTEIN_ possess a predicted helix at the n terminus a predicted helix at the c terminus and a special c terminal extension . in comparison with other cc type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ also has a specific amino acid n terminal extension and an additional amino acid intervening region between and which are also present only in its closest homolog _PROTEIN_ . to determine the effects of these specific regions on the _PROTEIN_ activity three deletion mutants were constructed _PROTEIN_ in which the n terminal extension including the helix was deleted _PROTEIN_ lacking the intervening region and _PROTEIN_ where the c terminal eight amino acids were removed . interactions of these mutagenized proteins with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were tested in yeast two hybrid and bifc experiments . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ still revealed a strong interaction affinity for the tested tga _PROTEIN_ in the yeast experiments . these results are consistent with a recent report that the n terminus of the arabidopsis cc type _PROTEIN_ protein does not contribute to the interactions with various tga _PROTEIN_ . however _PROTEIN_ failed to interact with any of the tested tga _PROTEIN_ . these findings were confirmed by in planta bifc experiments . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ each were cloned downstream of yn . yc was fused n terminally to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ individually . yellow _METHOD_ reconstitution was observed in the _LOCATION_ of tobacco leaf cells when _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were coexpressed with any of the examined tga _PROTEIN_ . although _PROTEIN_ still showed a nucleocytoplasmic _PROTEIN_ it lost the ability to interact with these tga _PROTEIN_ in transient _PROTEIN_ experiments demonstrating the importance of the _PROTEIN_ c terminus for mediating interactions with tga _PROTEIN_ in planta . finally the three mutated versions of _PROTEIN_ were introduced into _PROTEIN_ mutants and _PROTEIN_ under the control of the endogenous regulatory sequences of _PROTEIN_ . the construct _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ served as a positive control and rescued the _PROTEIN_ phenotype of _PROTEIN_ mutants in all analyzed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants . similarly all analyzed lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ complemented the _PROTEIN_ mutant . by contrast none of the investigated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants produced wild type flowers . these experiments prove that the n terminal extension and the intervening region are dispensable whereas the cc type specific c terminus is required for interactions with tga _PROTEIN_ and for the _PROTEIN_ protein to exert its function during _PROTEIN_ development . given the importance of the _PROTEIN_ c terminus cc type _PROTEIN_ with a different composition of the c terminal extension were further analyzed . to this end a phylogenetic tree was constructed for all cc type _PROTEIN_ including _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the first two characterized members of this _PROTEIN_ type . all other cc type _PROTEIN_ were named successively to _PROTEIN_ according to _PROTEIN_ protein sequence similarities with _PROTEIN_ . complementation analysis of _PROTEIN_ mutants was conducted for selected _PROTEIN_ genes driven under the control of _PROTEIN_ endogenous promoter sequences . besides _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ serving as positive controls known to complement the _PROTEIN_ mutant seven closely related cc type _PROTEIN_ were tested and three more distantly related ones _PROTEIN_ were included . this selection comprised at least one _PROTEIN_ as a representative for the different cc type active site motifs the ccmc _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . _PROTEIN_ phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ mutants were rescued in seven out of the tested cc type _PROTEIN_ genes . alignment of the c terminal amino acids for the cc type _PROTEIN_ reveals that all complementing _PROTEIN_ share a short motif al/iwl located at the end of the c terminus . one cc type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ contains a similar alwa motif at the c terminus but did not show a _PROTEIN_ like activity which might be due to a leu to ala exchange in the last position . these findings further highlight the importance of the _PROTEIN_ c terminus particularly the presence of an alwl motif for its functionality . to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ and tga genes are _PROTEIN_ in overlapping domains a prerequisite for an in vivo interaction we conducted in situ hybridization experiments for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ during different floral stages . _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in regions where floral buds and floral organ primordia are formed confirming earlier results . generally both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ exhibit a broader _PROTEIN_ pattern that includes the region of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in young flower buds _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts are localized in the floral meristem . for _PROTEIN_ a signal is also detected in the inflorescence apical meristem confirming earlier protein localization data . _PROTEIN_ continues to be _PROTEIN_ in a few cells in younger developing floral organs like _PROTEIN_ and stamens . here _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ show hybridization signals although weaker throughout _PROTEIN_ stamens and carpels in flowers of the same developmental stages . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ can be detected at _PROTEIN_ stages of flower development at the inner surface of carpels where ovules will be formed . in summary _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are coexpressed in floral tissues including _PROTEIN_ demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ protein interactions can occur in planta . currently _PROTEIN_ is the sole tga gene in arabidopsis with a known function specifically associated with flower development . to further test the genetic relationship between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ double mutants between _PROTEIN_ and pan were generated . whereas the _PROTEIN_ number is reduced in the _PROTEIN_ mutant and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ morphogenesis also is disturbed floral organ numbers in the pan mutant are increased in whorls and and _PROTEIN_ in whorl such that a pentamerous pattern is formed confirming data obtained from other pan alleles . in _PROTEIN_ pan double mutants similar to the pan single mutant flowers develop a pentamerous phenotype and are composed of sepals _PROTEIN_ and stamens in the first three whorls respectively . thus _PROTEIN_ is epistatic to _PROTEIN_ with respect to its function of regulating _PROTEIN_ primorida initiation . however pentamerous double mutant _PROTEIN_ also display an abnormal _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ morphogenesis such as the formation of smaller or folded _PROTEIN_ . this effect on _PROTEIN_ stages of _PROTEIN_ development is also observed in _PROTEIN_ single mutants . therefore _PROTEIN_ likely exerts an additional function that acts independently of _PROTEIN_ . as a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ likely modifies cys residues in target proteins posttranslationally . as our data show physical and genetic interactions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we further tested the importance of different cys residues in the _PROTEIN_ protein that might represent target sites for modification . out of the six cys residues present in _PROTEIN_ five of them _PROTEIN_ and are located in a _PROTEIN_ specific n terminal extension . the sixth cys is localized in one of the two conserved gln rich regions that may function as transactivation domains . all cys residues were individually mutagenized and converted into ser residues . wild type and the six mutated _PROTEIN_ cdnas were put under the control of the camv promoter and introduced into the pan mutant and the complementation capacity of mutagenized proteins was analyzed in transformants . the wild type and five n terminally mutated _PROTEIN_ proteins _PROTEIN_ were able to complement the pan mutant . however the _PROTEIN_ protein with a mutagenized failed to exert a wild type like activity . these data show that the conserved is crucial for _PROTEIN_ activity in flower development and this cys might therefore represent a target for a posttranslational modification by _PROTEIN_ . tga _PROTEIN_ are known to act redundantly in the regulation of pathogen response gene _PROTEIN_ and disease resistance in arabidopsis . the floral _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ raises the possibility that tga _PROTEIN_ might act redundantly during flower development . the chimeric repressor gene silencing technology was employed to overcome experimental limitations caused by functional redundancy of transcription _PROTEIN_ families . _PROTEIN_ was fused to the ear motif repression domain _PROTEIN_ that has been shown to dominantly repress the target gene _PROTEIN_ of transcription _PROTEIN_ and was _PROTEIN_ under the control of the camv promoter _PROTEIN_ in wild type plants . ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ induced severe defects during flower development whereas vegetative development was not affected . floral phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants could be classified into four groups tetramerous wild type flowers developing four normal _PROTEIN_ pentamerous flowers with five normal sepals _PROTEIN_ and stamens tetramerous flowers forming four _PROTEIN_ with normal small or folded shapes and pentamerous flowers with five _PROTEIN_ that are normal small or folded and five normal sepals and stamens . a similar phenotype distribution was observed when we _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in wild type plants under the control of a kb long upstream region of the _PROTEIN_ gene . overall the majority of flowers in the transgenic _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants thus resembled those of the _PROTEIN_ pan double mutant which also showed a pentamerous second whorl pattern and abnormalities in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ morphogenesis . the pentamerous pan like floral phenotype is likely caused by specific repression of _PROTEIN_ target genes by the cres t approach . however the additional phenotype an altered _PROTEIN_ morphogenesis can not solely be attributed to a reduced _PROTEIN_ activity . this phenotype might be caused by the chimeric _PROTEIN_ repressor having also silenced activities of other tga _PROTEIN_ which participate redundantly in the regulation of _PROTEIN_ morphogenesis .
arabidopsis thaliana mutants and wild type plants are all columbia ecotypes . arabidopsis seeds were sown in soil and treated at for a week . both tobacco and arabidopsis plants were grown in the greenhouse under controlled environmental conditions and irrigated from below . to identify target proteins that interact with _PROTEIN_ the intronless _PROTEIN_ coding sequence was pcr amplified from arabidopsis genomic dna and fused in frame as bait to the dna binding domain of in the bait vector by ecori and bamhi restriction sites . the mere _PROTEIN_ of this chimeric construct was not sufficient to activate marker genes in or thus enabling its use in screening _PROTEIN_ interaction partners . an arabidopsis whole plant cdna library fused to the coding sequence of the transcriptional activation domain of the prey vector _PROTEIN_ was transformed into the yeast strain serving as prey to identify _PROTEIN_ interaction partners on plates containing sd/ trp his leu ade and amino triazole _PROTEIN_ . after mating yeast cells were plated on selection medium as above colonies were picked and the corresponding cdna inserts isolated . to examine whether all eight tga _PROTEIN_ interact with _PROTEIN_ full length cdnas were pcr amplified cloned into and introduced into the yeast strain using a recombination strategy as detailed in supplemental methods online . after cotransformation yeast cells were plated on selection medium containing sd/ trp his leu ade and amino triazole _PROTEIN_ and then incubated in a growth chamber at for to d. to examine whether the n terminus the intervening region or the c terminus is crucial for _PROTEIN_ protein interactions three mutated versions of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were constructed and fused in frame as bait to the dna binding domain of in the bait vector by ecori and bamhi restriction sites respectively . primers used for cloning are listed in supplemental table online . leaves from to week old n. benthamiana plants were transformed by infiltration using a ml syringe of agrobacterium tumefaciens cells harboring appropriate plasmids . a. tumefaciens strain was used to examine intracellular localization of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ proteins . _METHOD_ was fused to the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ generating _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . an nls derived from the large t antigen was fused to the n terminus of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ yielding nls _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . cloning three _METHOD_ fragments _METHOD_ in frame upstream of _PROTEIN_ generated _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the generation of a nls _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct was achieved by n terminally fusing the same nls to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ fusion genes encoding these _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins were introduced into the pbar _PROTEIN_ vector by xmai and xbai restriction sites and transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaf epidermal cells under the control of the camv promoter and then monitored by capturing _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . to further confirm whether wild type and three mutagenized _PROTEIN_ proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as shown above interact in planta with tga _PROTEIN_ the bifc technique was applied . _PROTEIN_ compatible vectors pe _PROTEIN_ pe _PROTEIN_ and psyc were used to generate _PROTEIN_ vectors using a _PROTEIN_ cloning strategy where fusion genes are under the control of the camv promoter . the n terminus of _METHOD_ was cloned upstream of wild type and three mutagenized _PROTEIN_ proteins in the pe _PROTEIN_ vector . the c terminus of _METHOD_ was in frame fused n terminally for pe _PROTEIN_ and c terminally for psyc to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ individually . constructs were transformed into a. tumefaciens strain . to avoid cosuppression a. tumefaciens strain carrying the viral silencing suppressor gene was always included in the infiltration mixture . infiltrated tobacco leaves stayed attached to the plants and after to d leaves were examined for reconstitution of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and images captured with a leica tcs _PROTEIN_ confocal laser scanning microscope . coexpression of nonfused yn with nonfused yc or one of the fusion proteins with nonfused yn or nonfused yc was used as a negative control . primers used for cloning are listed in supplemental table online . protein sequences for all cc type arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were aligned using the clustalw program with default settings and adjusted manually . a neighbor joining tree was constructed with the program package phylip and visualized with treeview software . bootstrap analysis was performed with replications and obtained bootstrap values are indicated . to obtain _PROTEIN_ pan double mutants _PROTEIN_ was crossed with a homozygous pan line _PROTEIN_ . all plants developed wild type flowers . a segregating population was genotyped by pcr and _PROTEIN_ pan double mutants were identified and phenotypically analyzed . flower phenotypes were documented using a binocular microscope _PROTEIN_ mz fliii and images were made using a digital camera . primers used for pcr genotyping are listed in supplemental table online . to test whether three deleted versions of _PROTEIN_ or the selected cc type _PROTEIN_ exert a _PROTEIN_ like activity and complement _PROTEIN_ mutants respective cdnas were cloned in by xbai restriction sites upstream of a nos terminator and downstream of a kb _PROTEIN_ promoter fragment known to confer its endogenous _PROTEIN_ . secondary structure prediction for _PROTEIN_ allowing the identification of _PROTEIN_ specific regions was conducted using the protein sequence analysis tool . as described below intracellular _PROTEIN_ localization studies were performed using the pbar vector by driving the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of the camv promoter which has been demonstrated to complement the _PROTEIN_ mutant . _LOCATION_ localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was obtained by fusing an nls derived from the large t antigen to its n terminus . cytoplasmic _PROTEIN_ localization was achieved by adding three _METHOD_ fragments to the n terminus and further addition of an nls to this construct redirected the protein to the _LOCATION_ and thereby restored its functionality in the _PROTEIN_ complementation test . individual substitutions of all _PROTEIN_ cys residues by ser residues were performed by a pcr based mutagenesis approach using paired mutagenic oligomers and mutated versions of _PROTEIN_ were cloned into pbar by xmai and xbai restriction sites . as described previously by citation the chimeric _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ repressors were generated by fusing the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence to the c terminus of the _PROTEIN_ coding region introduced by xmai and xbai restriction sites into pbar for ectopic _PROTEIN_ under the control of the camv promoter and into pbar a for _PROTEIN_ in the genomic context of _PROTEIN_ using a bp genomic fragment . all these constructs were introduced into a. tumefaciens strain and transformation of wild type plants or mutants was performed with the floral dip method . transgenic plants were obtained by spraying with a _PROTEIN_ solution . for

_PROTEIN_ transgenic plants floral organ phenotypes were analyzed in at least transgenic plants . primers used for cloning are listed in supplemental table online . reverse primers containing the
