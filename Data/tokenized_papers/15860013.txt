most plant microtubule associated proteins have homologues across the phylogenetic spectrum . to find potential plant specific maps that will have evaded bioinformatic searches we devised a low stringency method for isolating proteins from an arabidopsis cell suspension on endogenous taxol microtubules . by tryptic peptide _METHOD_ fingerprinting we identified proteins that were enriched on taxol microtubules . amongst a range of known maps such as kinesins _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ we detected unknown kda proteins that belong to a family of five closely related arabidopsis proteins having no known homologues amongst non plant _METHOD_ . to verify that associates with microtubules in vivo it was _PROTEIN_ as a _METHOD_ fusion . this confirmed that the protein decorates all four microtubule arrays in both transiently infected arabidopsis and stably transformed tobacco by suspension cells . microtubule directed drugs perturbed the localization of but cytochalasin d did not . contains four predicted coiled coil domains and truncation studies identified a central domain that targets the fusion protein to microtubules in vivo . this study therefore introduces a novel family of plant specific proteins that interact with microtubules .
the present study involved a two stage strategy a low stringency identification of proteins enriched on taxol microtubules without any other pre selection and verification that any unknown putative maps as _METHOD_ fusion proteins bind microtubules in living cells . microtubule protein was isolated by inducing the polymerization of endogenous tubulins contained within extracts of arabidopsis protoplasts . polymerization was induced by incubating extracts in the presence of taxol but for min at . this clearly promoted the sedimentation of protein bands of kda that were established to be tubulin by immunoblotting using anti tubulin antibodies . immunoblotting with anti antibodies also confirmed the enrichment of two bands . cross reaction of an enriched kda band with an antibody to the bimc type kinesin related protein indicated the purification of the arabidopsis homologue . none of these bands was enriched in control samples to which taxol was not added . the procedure was cell line specific it was successful for the small dense suspension of arabidopsis landsberg ecotype cells but was unsuccessful for the larger more vacuolated columbia ecotype suspension cells or carrot or tobacco by suspension cells . bands specifically enriched in the microtubule pellets collected in the presence of taxol were then fractionated further by eluting the taxol pellet with mm nacl . the salt eluted fractions and salt resistant pellets were separated on long format _PROTEIN_ gels using a variety of polyacrylamide concentrations to optimize resolution . one dimensional gels were used as d gels would not have identified bands greater than ca . kda like the kda bimc kinesins and kda _PROTEIN_ . bands enriched by the addition of taxol were excised from the gel trypsinized and analysed by maldi tof _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . an example of the salt eluted fractions is presented in figure and the results from several gels at different concentrations are presented in table . maldi tof _METHOD_ _METHOD_ confirmed that cytoskeletal proteins were enriched in the presence of taxol . we identified eight of the nine beta tubulin isotypes in the arabidopsis genome five of the six alpha tubulin and both gamma tubulin genes . several well characterized maps were detected . in addition to the microtubule organization protein _PROTEIN_ two _METHOD_ of were found confirming to be the predominant _METHOD_ present in microtubule protein isolated from non synchronized cells . several kinesins were also enriched by the method three bimc kinesins and three c terminal kinesins the first two being _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . the method was not optimized for kinesins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ so it is interesting that six of the kinesin family members in the arabidopsis genome were concentrated in the taxol pellet . in other experiments amp _PROTEIN_ was added to prevent _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis from causing elution of kinesins from microtubules but no new kinesins were found in addition to the others already identified . antibodies used to investigate the carrot map method were employed to immunoblot the arabidopsis proteins in the taxol pellet . this confirmed the enrichment of _METHOD_ and the bimc kinesin . in addition to structural maps and microtubule motor proteins citation identified a third and more heterogeneous class of proteins that although not thought of as classical maps nevertheless associate with microtubules and may co purify with them . examples include glycolytic enzymes kinases proteins involved in biosynthesis and ribonucleoproteins carrying mrna . these interactions are not always well defined but they point to the _LOCATION_ as a transient _PROTEIN_ for many metabolic activities . in agreement with this a range of such proteins was enriched in the arabidopsis taxol pellet . briefly these include proteins involved in translation and transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ consistent with the idea that mrna complexes may be _PROTEIN_ to various parts of the cytoplasm via an association with microtubules heat shock proteins _PROTEIN_ two cohesins chromosome associated protein _PROTEIN_ and structural _PROTEIN_ of chromosome protein _PROTEIN_ considered to generate dynamic tension between microtubules and sister chromatids glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase reported to bundle microtubules and link vesicles of the endomembrane system to microtubules and sucrose synthase immunolocalized near cortical microtubules . however as the overall aim of this investigation was to screen for proteins not previously known to interact with microtubules we concentrated on a group of uncharacterized kda proteins . _GENE_ is an _PROTEIN_ protein of unknown function and localization with a predicted length of amino acids its predicted molecular weight of da corresponded with the position of the band on the gel . in the second part of the screen proteins of interest were transiently _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis suspension cells as n terminal _METHOD_ fusions to confirm that they locate to microtubules in living cells as well as in vitro . _METHOD_ decorated cortical microtubules in transverse patterns often labelling _PROTEIN_ bundles . to confirm that the labelling pattern of the fusion protein was dependent on microtubules the transformed cells were treated with anti cytoskeletal drugs . addition of taxol caused the microtubules to form bundles and this drew the _METHOD_ into _PROTEIN_ bundled patterns . depolymerization of microtubules with the herbicide oryzalin destroyed the pattern of cortical microtubules as well as the filamentous pattern of _METHOD_ . in this case the _METHOD_ label was found in scattered foci . in contrast depolymerization of actin filaments with cytochalasin d did not affect the filamentous pattern of the _METHOD_ label . although _METHOD_ labelled the mitotic spindle and the phragmoplast preprophase bands are not abundant in this arabidopsis suspension culture . in addition it is also possible that the higher levels of overexpression induced by transient infection could give rise to abnormal patterns and affect the progress of division we therefore made a stably transformed tobacco by line to study the division figures . in this stable cell line the fusion protein decorated microtubules around the cell cycle as previously seen for the transiently infected arabidopsis suspension . _METHOD_ decorated the cortical microtubules in a continuous rather than a punctate manner together with dot like material alongside the tubules . during division _METHOD_ decorated all of the microtubule containing structures . it decorated the preprophase band and the spindle microtubules labelling both the kinetochore bundles and the interpolar microtubules that passed across the metaphase plate . during cytokinesis the fusion protein bound the phragmoplast and at the _PROTEIN_ stage _PROTEIN_ phragmoplast figure shows that it does not decorate the midline . because bound taxol microtubules in vitro and decorated arabidopsis and tobacco microtubules in vivo it was designated . a blast search against genbank entries indicated that the protein is one of five similar arabidopsis proteins . _GENE_ protein named is similar to _GENE_ similar to _GENE_ similar to _GENE_ and similar to _GENE_ . is also related to four proteins from rice and one from tomato . multiple alignments of all five arabidopsis proteins using clustalx are shown in figure . a phylogenetic tree for the genes shows that arabidopsis _METHOD_ are most closely related to each other and that is the most divergent . blast and fasta searches against non redundant databases indicate that none of the family members has relatives amongst non plant _METHOD_ and could be only very distantly related to myosin ii heavy chain lamin a periplakin and binding protein kinase . is less similar to its nearest non protein hits than the plant is to its animal homologue _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is to . this indicates that are plant specific proteins . a psi blast search indicated that n terminal regions of all proteins share some homology to the rho associated coiled coil domain of a binding protein kinase . has no predicted trans _LOCATION_ domains and this applies to all other _METHOD_ . calculating the hydropathic properties using the kyte doolittle method indicates that proteins are largely hydrophilic and have no distinct hydrophobic regions consistent with its occurrence in the soluble arabidopsis cell homogenate . the _PROTEIN_ pattern of all five family members was investigated using publicly available microarray data . this showed that all five _METHOD_ are ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ throughout the arabidopsis plant . which is the subject of this study is the most highly _PROTEIN_ isoform in the hypocotyls and is also highly _PROTEIN_ in the shoot apex . this might suggest that is involved in cell elongation and/or the mitotic cycle . therefore to analyse the _PROTEIN_ of the family during the division cycle we examined the microarray data for synchronized arabidopsis suspension cells . in arabidopsis suspension cells synchronized by releasing them from sucrose starvation the mitotic marker cyclin _PROTEIN_ peaked h _PROTEIN_ . however only shows any significant upregulation over this period the more rapid increase in transcript levels suggesting a role in cell growth and/or re entry into the division cycle . by contrast shows relatively little variation as the cells enter division . this indicates that it is not transcriptionally regulated during the cell cycle and that the cycling of the protein between the various microtubule arrays is most probably post translationally controlled . to investigate the region of responsible for interaction with microtubules we examined its structure prior to making _METHOD_ fusions of variously truncated polypeptides . there is a high probability that has three coiled coil domains occurring between amino acids and a moderate probability of a fourth c terminal coiled coil . a non regular secondary structure region was found in between amino acids and that is between coiled coils and . this disordered region could represent a structurally flexible extended loop that is conserved in proteins and may play an important role in their function . in their genome wide screen of arabidopsis proteins predicted to form long coiled coils citation described as having three coiled coil domains but in our analysis we identified a fourth shorter coiled coil domain c terminal to the other three . to determine which if any of these four domains is necessary for targeting to microtubules in cells a series of truncations all fused at the n or the c terminus to _METHOD_ were transiently _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis cell suspensions . this showed that neither the n terminal domain nor the c terminal domain is necessary to target the protein to microtubules in living cells . further truncations established that an intact plus an n terminal portion of the nors domain and a c terminal portion of the domain stretching from amino acid to amino acid are essential for directing the fusion protein to microtubules . still further truncation of amino acids at either the c or the n terminus resulted in loss of the microtubule labelling confirming that part of the coiled coil and part of the nors domain together with play a role in targeting the protein to microtubules . this region is conserved within the arabidopsis family and in blast searches this restricted domain shows no homology to any known maps . bioinformatics searches have shown that many maps known in other eukaryotes have relatives in the plant kingdom but methods based on homologies obviously can not identify plant maps like _PROTEIN_ that have no fungal or animal relatives . biochemical binding assays offer an alternative direct approach . citation have already used a proteomics based search for arabidopsis maps . that study used columns of neuronal tubulin to isolate a range of tubulin binding proteins from arabidopsis suspension cultures but the inability to identify authentic maps like suggests that proteins that bind the assembled microtubule lattice as opposed to the tubulin dimer may have been excluded by such an approach . if further plant maps remain to be detected then assays involving microtubule binding are likely to play an important part .

on one ml flask of cells . after min at the microtubules were collected by centrifugation at g for min at . in other experiments the pellets were washed with m nacl containing taxol to release maps and centrifuged again . the procedure was also conducted without taxol microtubules to control for proteins that sediment independently of microtubules . the protein composition of the supernatant and
