_LOCATION_ kda acyl coa binding proteins _PROTEIN_ function in the storage and intracellular transport of acyl coa esters in eukaryotes . fatty acids synthesized de novo in plant chloroplasts are exported as oleoyl coa and palmitoyl coa esters . in arabidopsis other than the kda _PROTEIN_ there exists five larger _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of which homologues have not been characterized in other _METHOD_ . to investigate the significance of this gene family we have attempted to subcellularly localize them and compare their acyl coa binding affinities . we have previously shown that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _LOCATION_ associated proteins while _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ contain kelch motifs . here to localize _PROTEIN_ we have _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ red _METHOD_ protein from the camv promoter . _PROTEIN_ dsred was localized _LOCATION_ in transiently _PROTEIN_ tobacco by cells and onion epidermal cells . the function of the acyl coa binding domain in _PROTEIN_ was investigated by in vitro binding assays using _PROTEIN_ which was observed to bind arachidonyl coa with high affinity in comparison to palmitoyl coa and oleoyl coa . to identify the residues functional in binding five mutants with single amino acid substitutions in the acyl coa binding domain of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were generated by site directed mutagenesis . binding assays with arachidonyl coa revealed that replacement of a conserved r residue _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ disrupted binding . in contrast other substitutions in _PROTEIN_ and in _PROTEIN_ did not affect arachidonyl coa binding unlike their equivalents in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which had altered binding to palmitoyl coa or oleoyl coa .
using the psort www server as available on http //psort.nibb.ac.jp _PROTEIN_ was predicted to contain a cleavable n terminal signal sequence and was _LOCATION_ localized with high certainty . the putative cleavage site lies between amino acids and on _PROTEIN_ . the previous use of the psort www server had demonstrated its reliability in the subcellular localizations of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which was subsequently confirmed by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions . using the method of tusnady and simon we further located the presence of one transmembrane domain in _PROTEIN_ which overlapped its putative signal sequence . to investigate the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ a translational fusion of full length _PROTEIN_ peptide fused to the n terminus of was generated . following particle bombardment the protein fusion transiently _PROTEIN_ from the constitutive camv promoter in tobacco by cells or onion epidermal cells was examined under a laser scanning confocal microscope . on confocal microscopy the signal from the _PROTEIN_ dsred fusion protein was observed at the periphery of the cells while that of the control construct _PROTEIN_ dsred alone was confined to the _LOCATION_ . to determine if the _PROTEIN_ dsred fusion protein is associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ the bombarded onion epidermal cells were subjected to plasmolysis . it was observed that the dsred signal was not associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ upon plasmolysis . in contrast no _METHOD_ was detected in untransformed by and onion epidermal cells . thus it appears that _PROTEIN_ is localized _LOCATION_ consistent with its subcellular prediction . to investigate the function of the acyl coa binding domain in _PROTEIN_ it was essential to _PROTEIN_ it for in vitro binding assays with acyl coa esters . to this end the cdna encoding _PROTEIN_ was obtained by rt pcr for production of tagged recombinant protein in e. coli . the cdna was cloned in _PROTEIN_ vector prsetb in frame to the tag to enable easy purification of the recombinant proteins from crude bacterial extracts using ni _PROTEIN_ agarose . initially the _PROTEIN_ of recombinant _PROTEIN_ from the full length cdna on plasmid _PROTEIN_ posed some _METHOD_ with e. coli growth . using the psort program the recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ from plasmid _PROTEIN_ was predicted to be targeted to the e. coli _LOCATION_ . possibly the _PROTEIN_ recombinant protein affected bacterial _LOCATION_ integrity and was consequently detrimental to the transformed cells hence the observed growth inhibition . subsequently the acyl coa binding domain of _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in e. coli . in psort analysis this smaller _PROTEIN_ recombinant protein would be targeted to the _LOCATION_ . its accumulation was observed in the insoluble fraction of bacterial extracts . on _METHOD_ blue stained gel _PROTEIN_ had an apparent molecular _METHOD_ of kda . on western blot analysis the kda band cross reacted with the qiaexpress ni _PROTEIN_ ap conjugate . in comparison the calculated molecular _METHOD_ of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ from the truncated cdna is kda . _PROTEIN_ protein was recovered from the insoluble fractions by urea solubilization of inclusion bodies . the solubilized fusion proteins were then purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography using ni _PROTEIN_ resin under denaturing conditions . using _PROTEIN_ polyacrylamide gel followed by _METHOD_ blue staining _PROTEIN_ eluted in both buffer d and buffer e . following dialysis refolding and concentration the purified recombinant _PROTEIN_ was used for in vitro binding assays . using lipidex assays the binding of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to commercially available acyl coa esters palmitoyl coa oleoyl coa and arachidonyl coa representative of saturated monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids respectively were tested . this set of fatty acids had been previously used in binding assay tests with recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and a comparison of their binding affinities with recombinant _PROTEIN_ was sought . also previous investigations on recombinant _PROTEIN_ had not tested its binding to arachidonyl coa . both recombinant _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were shown to preferentially bind arachidonyl coa rather than palmitoyl coa or oleoyl coa . the k d values for arachidonyl coa calculated from the scatchard plots for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were and respectively while the k d values for both oleoyl coa for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were . to investigate the possibility of the binding of recombinant _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to plant polyunsaturated fatty acyl coa non radiolabelled linolenoyl coa was used as a competitor in lipidex assays with arachidonyl coa since radiolabelled linolenoyl coa is not commercially available . the results indicate that linolenoyl coa could not compete with arachidonyl coa in binding _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . to establish the significance of the acyl coa binding domain in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ altogether five single amino acid substitutions at the acyl coa binding domain in each _PROTEIN_ were created using in vitro site directed mutagenesis . since _PROTEIN_ has been recently observed to bind arachidonyl coa with an affinity similar to palmitoyl coa but lower than those of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ it was noted that substitutions in _PROTEIN_ that had impaired palmitoyl coa binding were also conserved in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ except for in _PROTEIN_ . thus these four residues in each of recombinant _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were initial targets for site directed mutagenesis . in comparison both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which bind oleoyl coa with high affinities but do not bind arachidonyl coa are conserved in only two of the four _PROTEIN_ equivalents deemed essential for palmitoyl coa binding _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . single amino acid substitutions affecting the four _PROTEIN_ equivalents were made in each of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . these mutant _METHOD_ of recombinant _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were created by in vitro mutagenesis on plasmid templates and _PROTEIN_ respectively . the mutant proteins were _PROTEIN_ and extracted from e. coli following conditions established for wild type and were subsequently used in lipidex assays . however results revealed that these single amino acid substitutions did not adversely affect arachidonyl coa binding when compared to wild type . since an r residue had been previously demonstrated to be important in binding arachidonic acid the function of the only r residue conserved in both the acyl coa binding domains of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was further tested . this r residue is conserved in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which bind arachidonyl coa but not in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . mutants _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and in _PROTEIN_ were generated and were _PROTEIN_ in e. coli following conditions established for wild type . they were subsequently used in lipidex assays for binding arachidonyl coa . results showed that this r substitution in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ culminated in reduced arachidonyl coa binding activity . all five amino acid residues chosen for site directed mutagenesis in recombinant _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are predicted to lie within the acyl coa binding pocket based on a homology model generated with the aid of the x ray crystal structures of bovine _PROTEIN_ . the structures of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ show the front views of the proteins . the structures of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are similar to those of other previously reported _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ because the fold of the peptide backbones of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ show each protein as an up down down up four helix bundle with an overhand loop connecting helices and . in contrast to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ contains three helices and lacks the fourth helix when compared to the template bovine _PROTEIN_ .

confirmation of this truncated _PROTEIN_ cdna . plasmid prgd used in this study was derived from plasmid pgdr which contains the gene encoding the red _METHOD_ protein dsred . dsred was amplified by pcr using forward primer _PROTEIN_ and reverse primer _PROTEIN_ and then cloned into vector pgem t easy . after confirmation of the pcr insert by dna sequencing analysis the apai bglii fragment of dsred from the pgem t easy derivative was cloned into the apai and bamhi sites on vector pgd to yield prgd . _PROTEIN_ consisting of amino acids to on a kb bamhi apai fragment of _PROTEIN_ cdna from plasmid _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was fused in frame with dsred of prgd to yield construct _PROTEIN_ that was subsequently used for localization studies . the end deletion derivative of the _PROTEIN_ cdna

amino acids at the n terminal of _PROTEIN_ . protein concentrations of bacterial crude extracts were determined by the method of bradford and samples harvested at various time intervals were analysed

transferred to ecl _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gel using the trans blot cell following the manufacturer s instructions . western blot analysis was performed as described by sambrook .

binding assays with palmitoyl coa _METHOD_ oleoyl coa or arachidonyl coa were carried out using lipidex with recombinant _PROTEIN_ following leung et al . . lipidex consists of sephadex lh a hydrophobic column packing material that separates protein bound and unbound fatty acids . recombinant _PROTEIN_ were equilibrated in buffer with radiolabelled acyl coa after which lipidex was added to bind unbound acyl coa. subsequently the lipidex/acyl coa complex was sedimented by centrifugation and the acyl coa bound to recombinant _PROTEIN_ was estimated by determining the radioactivity in the supernatant . assays were performed in triplicates with blanks at each concentration of acyl coa . each recombinant _PROTEIN_ was dissolved in of binding buffer to obtain a stock solution of
