the _LOCATION_ is an important power generator in most eukaryotic cells . to preserve its function many essential _LOCATION_ encoded _PROTEIN_ play specific roles in mitochondrial rna metabolic processes including rna editing . rna editing consists of post transcriptional deamination which alters specific nucleotides in transcripts to mediate gene _PROTEIN_ . in plant cells many pentatricopeptide repeat proteins _PROTEIN_ participate in diverse organellar rna metabolic processes but only _PROTEIN_ type _PROTEIN_ are involved in rna editing . here we report a p type _PROTEIN_ protein from arabidopsis thaliana p type _PROTEIN_ modulating editing _PROTEIN_ which has a distinct role in mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ rna editing via rna binding activity . in the homozygous ppme mutant cytosine to uracil conversions at both the _PROTEIN_ and sites were abolished disrupting to _PROTEIN_ and to amino acid changes in the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ protein . _PROTEIN_ is a critical component of mitochondrial respiration complex i its activity is severely reduced in the homozygous ppme mutant resulting in significantly altered growth and development . both abolished rna editing and defective complex i activity were completely rescued by camv promoter and _PROTEIN_ native promoter driven _PROTEIN_ genomic fragments tagged with _METHOD_ in a homozygous ppme background . our experimental results demonstrate a distinct role of a p type _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ in rna editing in plant organelles .
the arabidopsis salk t dna insertional mutant collection was screened for mutants with defects in post embryonic development and/or seed germination . one mutant had an abnormal phenotype in progenies segregated from heterozygotes and the homozygous mutant harbored a t dna insertion that disrupted the coding region of the arabidopsis gene . this gene does not contain any intron instead it encodes an uncharacterized p type _PROTEIN_ protein involved in mitochondrial rna editing . therefore we named it p type _PROTEIN_ modulating editing _PROTEIN_ protein . the homozygous ppme mutant ppme / is a null mutant with undetectable transcription as demonstrated by rt pcr . _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ during almost all growth and development stages suggesting that it has a housekeeping role . indeed when heterozygous ppme seeds were germinated in soil no mutants were detected in the ppme self pollinated generation for which the wild type to ppme progeny segregation ratio was . these results reflect defective embryonic and/or post embryonic development in the mutant . nevertheless when ppme seeds were germinated on solid _METHOD_ medium small ppme / seedlings were recovered but the growth of day old seedlings was significantly stunted . after continuous growth on solid _METHOD_ medium for days these seedlings survived but exhibited significant dwarfing after transfer to soil . figure type

generation . in total seeds harvested from heterozygous ppme plants were germinated in soil for month . genotyping revealed that and of the progeny were wild type and heterozygous plants respectively and no homozygous ppme plants were found . the p value indicates that the segregation ratio was according to the chi square test . to complement the defective growth of camv promoter driven and _PROTEIN_ native promoter driven _PROTEIN_ genomic fragments tagged with _METHOD_ were transformed into the ppme mutant . both constructs successfully rescued the phenotypes and rt pcr confirmed the presence of transformed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in complementation lines . furthermore at the reproductive stage produced normal flowers with severely aborted siliques containing shriveled seeds and the plants exhibited significantly reduced viability . therefore the stunted phenotype of was caused by the loss of functional _PROTEIN_ which is essential for both post embryonic development and vegetative and reproductive growth and development . _PROTEIN_ encodes a protein harboring degenerate pentatricopeptide motifs and it is classified as a p type _PROTEIN_ protein . in flowering plants most _PROTEIN_ are localized to the chloroplasts or additionally the growth retarded phenotype of is similar to the phenotypes of several arabidopsis mitochondria localized _PROTEIN_ mutants with defective mitochondrial rna processing including _PROTEIN_ and next we investigated the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ . complete colocalization of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and mito tracker signals was observed in root hairs of stable complementation lines containing _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ genomic fragments in a background . similar results were obtained using targetp prediction software . thus we confirmed that _PROTEIN_ is a mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ protein that may be involved in regulating mitochondrial rna metabolism . figure localization of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis plant

the splicing efficiency and abundance of all arabidopsis mitochondrial transcripts . in general real time qrt pcr revealed comparable splicing efficiencies for most mitochondrial transcripts between wild type and camv promoter driven seedlings . the seedlings had a lower splicing efficiency for _PROTEIN_ intron transcripts but this _PROTEIN_ efficiency was not as obvious compared with our previously characterized splicing mutants and slow growth we examined the levels of spliced transcripts for individual mitochondrial exons and found that the _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ transcript level was slightly reduced in seedlings compared with wild type and seedlings . then we examined the abundances of individual mitochondrial transcripts in wild type and seedlings . in seedlings most transcripts were upregulated as previously reported in other mitochondrial while the _PROTEIN_ mrna level was slightly downregulated . similar impairments in _PROTEIN_ intron splicing have been observed in several unrelated mutants with defects in mitochondrial rna therefore this phenomenon might simply be due to abnormal mitochondrial activity and may not contribute to the phenotypic defects observed in these mutants including described in this study . next we examined another aspect of rna metabolism the overall mitochondrial rna editing profiles in wild type and complemented seedlings . to identify mitochondrial editing sites mitochondrial transcripts were extracted from all samples and converted to cdna . the cdna fragments complementary to editing sites were amplified using specific primer pairs described and were subjected to dna sequencing . surprisingly among all examined editing sites only the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ sites located at positions and of the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ gene respectively exhibited completely abolished and substantially reduced editing in seedlings . the reduced editing in these seedlings could be completely rescued by either camv promoter driven or _PROTEIN_ native promoter driven constructs . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are non silent editing leading to codon switches from cgg to ugg at _PROTEIN_ and from ccu to ucu at _PROTEIN_ after editing resulting in amino acid changes in the _PROTEIN_ subunit of nadh dehydrogenase . figure editing at mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ rna editing sites in homozygous

by stopping the reaction with ddatp . the edited and unedited products were separated in a sequencing gel and visualized by detection of fam _METHOD_ signals . the edited products are from wild type and seedlings and seedlings from complementation lines . to validate the sequencing results the _PROTEIN_ site exhibiting complete loss editing deficiency was analyzed using a more sensitive approach the poisoned primer extension _PROTEIN_ to determine the corresponding sizes of completely edited and non edited controls synthetic correct and mutated nucleotide sequences were used in the _PROTEIN_ assay . accumulated edited products were detected in the mitochondria of wild type seedlings and seedlings from complemented lines however almost no edited products were detected in the mitochondria of seedlings . these results are consistent with the previous sequencing results . taken together these findings not only suggest that defects in both the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ editing sites coordinately contribute to the phenotype but also imply that both the arg to trp and pro to ser amino acid conversions are critical for proper mitochondrial functioning during normal arabidopsis growth and development . most _PROTEIN_ are known as site recognition _PROTEIN_ because of their abilities to bind to specific rna targets . for example arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ recognize and bind to corresponding editing sites e.g. _PROTEIN_ directly binds to the region surrounding _PROTEIN_ to regulate the _PROTEIN_ rna editing we showed that _PROTEIN_ influenced the editing efficiencies of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and subsequently more closely examined this _PROTEIN_ mediated regulation . first to assess the rna binding capacity of _PROTEIN_ a recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein n terminally tagged with maltose binding protein and an in vitro transcribed region spanning to of the _PROTEIN_ editing site were tested by rna electrophoretic mobility shift assay _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ was used as it exhibited completely disrupted editing in the _PROTEIN_ null mutant . mbp alone and the sequences surrounding _PROTEIN_ which showed complete conversion from cytidine to uridine in both wild type and seedlings in our editing screen were used as the trans and cis negative controls respectively to validate the binding specificity . mbp alone had no detectable affinity for the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ probe however mbp tagged _PROTEIN_ exhibited dose dependent binding to the _PROTEIN_ but not to the _PROTEIN_ probe . the affinity between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was completely titrated by addition of competitive cold _PROTEIN_ probe . the _METHOD_ result clearly demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ can bind the region surrounding the _PROTEIN_ site likely affecting rna editing by this means . figure _METHOD_ showing that recombinant _PROTEIN_ specifically binds to sequences surrounding the _PROTEIN_ editing site . mbp tagged _PROTEIN_ recombinant proteins were co incubated with _PROTEIN_

and pm probe was used for the all rna _METHOD_ . next to validate the specificity of the cis element for _PROTEIN_ binding to _PROTEIN_ and other possible target sites including _PROTEIN_ rna probes specifically designed to cover and/or overlap the nucleotides in the areas surrounding the editing sites were used to examine affinity for _PROTEIN_ by rna _METHOD_ . among the different probes used including the negative control cis element _PROTEIN_ to only the nad and regions were bound by mbp tagged _PROTEIN_ . however the probe partially overlapped with but was not recognized by mbp tagged _PROTEIN_ . the cis elements required for trans acting _PROTEIN_ binding and rna editing specificity have been reported to be located in regions including the nucleotides around the editing in addition a region upstream of _PROTEIN_ near the downstream of _PROTEIN_ is required for _PROTEIN_ binding . the reduced rna editing efficiency at the _PROTEIN_ site in the ppme mutant may be a secondary effect of the loss of interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the downstream region . therefore this interaction may be critical for the binding of other trans _PROTEIN_ to these editing sites downstream of _PROTEIN_ . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ functions as a promising editing _PROTEIN_ that specifically binds to the typical cis elements spanning the to nucleotides surrounding the _PROTEIN_ site in vitro . recently several studies have suggested that _PROTEIN_ proteins recognize their targets by screening their targeted transcripts for combination codes in brief pairing of the sixth amino acid residue in each _PROTEIN_ motif with the first amino acid residue in the following motif may result in tracking and binding to specific nucleotides located upstream of editing sites . the _PROTEIN_ protein contains p type _PROTEIN_ motifs thus the combination of sixth amino acid residues in motifs to and the first amino acid residues in motifs to were analyzed to determine the _PROTEIN_ code for the _PROTEIN_ upstream sequence . however _PROTEIN_ had a less conserved combination code another prediction software tool tprpred revealed that _PROTEIN_ had _PROTEIN_ motifs and a less commonly predicted combination code for _PROTEIN_ binding was obtained . additionally approve software was used to analyze the conserved combination code for _PROTEIN_ but none was detected . the current known _PROTEIN_ combination code might not be suitable for our _PROTEIN_ protein and further extensive study of amino acid changes within the _PROTEIN_ domains of _PROTEIN_ may provide new insights into _PROTEIN_ combination code usage . alternatively _PROTEIN_ may interact with other _PROTEIN_ and/or dyw domain containing proteins to perform rna editing as observed in other _PROTEIN_ family to test this hypothesis we immunoprecipitated potential _PROTEIN_ interacting proteins from day old seedlings complemented with _METHOD_ tagged camv promoter driven or _PROTEIN_ native promoter driven _PROTEIN_ genomic fragments . neither dyw containing proteins nor _PROTEIN_ proteins were found . compared with the well characterized editing functions of _PROTEIN_ type _PROTEIN_ the p type _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ may be a new site recognition trans _PROTEIN_ that modulates the rna editing of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis mitochondria . table _PROTEIN_

experiment . the stunted growth of is similar to that of a mutant with defective trans splicing of mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ encodes the _PROTEIN_ component of nadh dehydrogenase which is essential for functional complex i activity in the loss of function of _PROTEIN_ has been shown to cause disassembly of mitochondrial complex i in one _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ further a mutation of _PROTEIN_ resulted in the failed editing of both mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and no change in the or amino acid in the _PROTEIN_ protein . nevertheless an amino acid comparison revealed that a trp residue resulting from the change from to _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ but not a ser residue from to in _PROTEIN_ after editing is highly conserved in humans and in most plant mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ proteins . we next examined the activity of mitochondrial complex i in seedlings . crude mitochondrial protein extracts were separated using native _PROTEIN_ and then nadh dehydrogenase activity was interestingly complex i activity was markedly reduced in seedlings and this defect could be fully rescued by either _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or genomic _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs . these results also demonstrate the critical influences of conserved _PROTEIN_ and likely of divergent in _PROTEIN_ on arabidopsis mitochondrial complex i activity . briefly our findings suggest that abnormal developmental growth of is caused by _PROTEIN_ complex i activity resulting from loss of rna editing of mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ transcripts . figure _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ editing plays an important role in arabidopsis mitochondrial complex i activity . comparison of the amino acid identities of _PROTEIN_ c termini from different _METHOD_ shows that the conserved edited form of _PROTEIN_ has an

the ppme mutant was obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center . seeds were surface sterilized and placed on half strength murashige and skoog medium containing sucrose and phytoagar with subsequent stratification for d at . then they were grown inside of a growth chamber under a h h dark cycle at . after days of germination on _METHOD_ medium ppme homozygous seedlings were transferred to soil for further growth . the coding region and kb genomic fragments of _PROTEIN_ were amplified using the following primers bamhi _PROTEIN_ bamhi ctatcctgaggttgcagggtttg bamhi

_PROTEIN_ cellular localization was evaluated in root hair cells from homozygous _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants with a ppme homozygous background . seven day old seedlings were stained with mitotracker orange and observed using a confocal microscope with excitation at nm and _PROTEIN_ ir detection filters . total rna was isolated from g day old wild type homozygous and complemented seedlings with a qiagen rneasy mini kit . then cdna was synthesized with m mlv reverse transcriptase and random hexamer primers as previously the rna splicing efficiencies of mitochondrial genes were evaluated using strategies . primers targeting either the exon exon or exon intron junctions of individual introns in mitochondrial genes were used for amplification . then the amplicons for these junctions were detected using power sybr green supermix _METHOD_ and an abi prism sequence detection system _METHOD_ . the spliced/unspliced ratio was calculated from the ratio of the quantity of exon exon junctions to the quantity of exon intron junctions as previously the spliced products were further amplified by rt pcr with the primer sets targeting the exon exon junctions pcr was performed for cycles to saturation and any unspliced products were detected . mitochondrial rna stability was evaluated using primer sets as previously all quantifications were normalized to housekeeping genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ubc and _PROTEIN_ . all known editing sites in the coding regions of mitochondrial genes were amplified from cdna generated from day old seedlings using previously described methods of a splicing experiment and the corresponding primer the resulting amplicons harboring editing sites were further sequenced to determine the editing efficiency at each site . for example the primers _PROTEIN_ tctttccaggaggttggccg and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were used to generate amplicons harboring _PROTEIN_ . further sequencing was performed with the _PROTEIN_ primer . _PROTEIN_ assay was performed as previously the primer fam labeled ctaatgatagaggcaagaacactttcc was used to assess the editing efficiency of _PROTEIN_ . for _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ recombinant protein the n terminal transit peptide of _PROTEIN_ was excluded . the primers ecori _PROTEIN_ and hindiii ctaatgatgatgatgatgatgtcctgaggttgcagggtttg were used to amplify the _PROTEIN_ coding region without the n terminal transit peptide which was then ligated into a pmal cri vector . both the _PROTEIN_ construct and pmal cri empty vector were further transformed into the e. coli codonplus strain . the recombinant proteins were _PROTEIN_ at after hr induction with mm iptg and were then further purified using dextrin sepharose high performance chromatography resin . the following primer sets were used to synthesize _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ probes respectively via in vitro transcription using rna polymerase taatacgactcactatagggagacatttccacgatatcgttatg and _PROTEIN_ and taatacgactcactatagggagacggtgcaaaatcaatag and taccgatagcagctcccgctgaagc . further the following synthetic rna oligos were used as probes to examine the regions surrounding _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to
