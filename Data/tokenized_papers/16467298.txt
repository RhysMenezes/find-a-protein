the folding of glycoproteins in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ depends on a quality control mechanism mediated by the calnexin/calreticulin cycle . during this process continuous _PROTEIN_ trimming and udp _PROTEIN_ dependent re _PROTEIN_ of unfolded glycoproteins takes place . to ensure proper folding increases in misfolded proteins lead to up regulation of the components involved in quality control through a process known as the unfolded protein response . reglucosylation is catalyzed by the _LOCATION_ lumenal located enzyme udp _PROTEIN_ glycoprotein _PROTEIN_ but as udp _PROTEIN_ is synthesized in the _LOCATION_ a udp _PROTEIN_ transporter is required in the calnexin/calreticulin cycle . even though such a transporter has been hypothesized no protein playing this role in the _LOCATION_ yet has been identified . here we provide evidence that _PROTEIN_ a udp galactose/glucose transporter from arabidopsis thaliana responds to stimuli that trigger the upr increasing its _PROTEIN_ around fold . the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ transcript is accompanied by an increase in the level of the _PROTEIN_ protein . moreover subcellular localization studies indicate that _PROTEIN_ is localized in the _LOCATION_ of plant cells . we reasoned that an impairment in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ should perturb the calnexin/calreticulin cycle leading to an increase in misfolded protein and triggering the upr . toward that end we analyzed an _PROTEIN_ insertional mutant and found an up regulation of the _LOCATION_ chaperones bip and calnexin suggesting that these plants may be constitutively activating the upr . thus we propose that in a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ is the udp _PROTEIN_ transporter involved in quality control in the _LOCATION_ .
_PROTEIN_ responds to the analyzed the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene in day old plants treated with dtt a treatment that is known to trigger the upr given its interference in the formation of disulfide bonds . northern blot analysis showed that plants treated with dtt increased the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ as well as the _PROTEIN_ of the chaperones bip and calnexin two genes up regulated under this treatment . the _PROTEIN_ of actin showed no change confirming that the treatment was specific . to obtain more accurate and quantitative information of the changes in _PROTEIN_ transcript levels caused by dtt we performed real time pcr analysis . the results of this experiment showed a fold increase in the _PROTEIN_ transcript amount in plants exposed to dtt confirming the result obtained by northern analysis . to study whether the changes in transcript levels correlated with an increase in the accumulation of the protein we performed western blot analysis using an _PROTEIN_ peptide affinity purified antibody . the results showed that seedlings treated with dtt had an increase in the amount of the _PROTEIN_ protein whereas actin levels did not change under these conditions . all these results strongly suggest that _PROTEIN_ is an upr up regulated gene . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is related to genes involved in protein plants grown under different conditions the analysis of genes that show the same profile of _PROTEIN_ as the _PROTEIN_ gene may provide information _PROTEIN_ the cellular processes in which they are involved . using the data base module of csb.db and genome _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ profiles obtained from different plant growth condition a co _PROTEIN_ analysis was carried out . the results indicate that _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ strongly correlates with the _PROTEIN_ of bip calnexin and other chaperones or proteins related to stress . in addition the largest set of genes co _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ bip and calnexin at the same time correspond to proteins related to stress and redox regulation . as a control the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ a _LOCATION_ localized udp galactose transporter was analyzed . however its _PROTEIN_ pattern did not show any correlation with the _PROTEIN_ of genes encoding for proteins involved in protein folding . _PROTEIN_ is localized at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ transports udp _PROTEIN_ and responds to the upr we hypothesized that this protein could be in the _LOCATION_ . to investigate its subcellular location we constructed a chimera by fusing the green _METHOD_ protein to the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ . this chimeric protein was capable of incorporating udp galactose into microsomes from tobacco leaves infiltrated with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ indicating that the fusion protein was functional . since most of the nucleotide sugar transporters identified to date are localized in the _LOCATION_ apparatus the distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in epidermal cells of tobacco leaves was compared with the pattern of both _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ markers . the distribution of soluble _METHOD_ was also analyzed . the results showed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ has a reticulated distribution resembling that obtained for _METHOD_ hdel an _LOCATION_ located protein . in contrast _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a _LOCATION_ localized gdp mannose transporter showed a punctate pattern . the _METHOD_ dots were motile and sensitive to brefeldin a . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is located at the _LOCATION_ and not at the _LOCATION_ apparatus . to confirm the localization of _PROTEIN_ we performed subcellular fractionation of arabidopsis plants and analyzed the location of _PROTEIN_ using an affinity purified peptide antibody raised against the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ . upon homogenization of the tissue the organelles were separated on a discontinuous sucrose gradient and fractions enriched both in _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were obtained . the signal detected by the antibody against _PROTEIN_ showed the same distribution as the _LOCATION_ marker distinct from the distribution of the two _LOCATION_ markers . these results along with those obtained using the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein strongly suggest that _PROTEIN_ is indeed located at the _LOCATION_ . an _PROTEIN_ insertional mutant _PROTEIN_ shows up regulation of upr related _PROTEIN_ provides the udp _PROTEIN_ required for the re _PROTEIN_ of misfolded glycoproteins the absence of _PROTEIN_ should produce an alteration in the normal folding process in the _LOCATION_ . thus an increase in misfolded proteins may occur triggering the upr . to investigate this hypothesis we searched for mutants in _PROTEIN_ . a gene trap line containing an insertion of the ds element in the _PROTEIN_ gene was characterized . the analysis of this line using pcr indicated that the ds insertion was in the first exon of the _PROTEIN_ gene . southern analysis showed changes in the pattern of _PROTEIN_ genomic dna digested with ecori consistent with the insertion of the ds element in this region . in addition pcr analysis and the observation that of the plants obtained upon self pollination were resistant to kanamycin the selection marker indicated that the _PROTEIN_ insertion line was homozygous . the analysis of the number of insertions by southern blot analysis detecting the gus gene present in the ds element revealed a single band indicating that a single insertion was present in _PROTEIN_ . furthermore the population obtained from the backcross showed that of the plants were able to grow in kanamycin whereas of the plants were sensitive to the antibiotic . this segregation ratio together with the molecular analysis indicated the presence of a single ds insertion in the genome of _PROTEIN_ . northern blot analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ was not _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . finally udp _PROTEIN_ uptake assays were performed in _LOCATION_ derived vesicles obtained from wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants . the result showed that _LOCATION_ derived vesicles obtained from _PROTEIN_ plants had a _PROTEIN_ uptake of udp _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type . to test the hypothesis that the upr could be activated in the _PROTEIN_ mutant we analyzed the _PROTEIN_ of bip . northern analysis showed that the bip transcript was much more abundant in the _PROTEIN_ mutant whereas the level of the actin transcript or the udp galactose transporter _PROTEIN_ transcript was similar in wild type and mutant plants . to quantify the magnitude of the changes in gene _PROTEIN_ of chaperones involved in quality control we carried out real time pcr experiments . the results showed that bip was fold and calnexin fold more abundant in the _PROTEIN_ mutant compared with the wild type plants . in contrast the level of the _PROTEIN_ transcript was the same in both the mutant and the wild type . thus bip and calnexin are overexpressed in the mutant suggesting that _PROTEIN_ plants have the upr constitutively activated .
