_PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is an ubiquitin ligase that represses photomorphogenesis in the dark . therefore proteins interacting with _PROTEIN_ could be important regulators of light dependent development . here we identify _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as a novel interaction partner of _PROTEIN_ . a green _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ fusion protein colocalizes with _PROTEIN_ to _LOCATION_ speckles when transiently _PROTEIN_ in plant cells . this localization requires the b box domains in _PROTEIN_ indicating a novel function of this domain . a loss of function _PROTEIN_ mutant has longer hypocotyls in red light and in short days . unlike constans the _PROTEIN_ mutant flowers early and shows a reduced number of _PROTEIN_ branches in short days . the mutant also exhibits reduced formation of _PROTEIN_ roots . the _PROTEIN_ mutation partially suppresses the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations in the dark suggesting that _PROTEIN_ acts downstream of both of these repressors . however the _PROTEIN_ mutation exerts opposing effects on _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ roots and anthocyanin accumulation suggesting that _PROTEIN_ also has activities that are independent of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in conclusion we have identified _PROTEIN_ as a positive regulator of photomorphogenesis that acts downstream of _PROTEIN_ but can promote _PROTEIN_ root development independently of _PROTEIN_ and also function as a daylength sensitive regulator of shoot branching .
_PROTEIN_ was used as bait in a yeast two hybrid screen in an effort to identify novel light signaling components . in addition to the previously reported _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins the screen identified three cdnas encoded by the _PROTEIN_ gene _GENE_ . _PROTEIN_ is one of the five _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ like proteins most closely related to _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ like _PROTEIN_ has two n terminal tandemly repeated b box domains a _PROTEIN_ domain in the c terminal half of the protein and a conserved motif in the c terminus . the b boxes show amino acid identity and the _PROTEIN_ domain shows amino acid identity between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . the ligating b box has been proposed to be a protein interaction domain but it does not appear to be required for the interaction with _PROTEIN_ in yeast because all three cdnas identified in the screen encode a truncated _PROTEIN_ protein lacking the n terminal amino acids . the _PROTEIN_ protein used as bait contains three protein interacting domains a _PROTEIN_ finger a coiled coil domain and a repeat domain . to further examine the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we used dna binding domain fusions of _PROTEIN_ proteins identified in three _PROTEIN_ alleles _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ lacks the domain whereas _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ contain a deletion and an amino acid substitution in the domain respectively . we found that _PROTEIN_ is unable to interact with either of the _PROTEIN_ proteins containing deletions or mutations in the domain suggesting that the domain in _PROTEIN_ is required for the interaction with _PROTEIN_ . previous studies have identified val pro pairs in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins that are critical for their interaction with _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ contains five vp pairs and we substituted three of these with ala _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to examine whether they were involved in the interaction with _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ proteins were all _PROTEIN_ at similar levels in yeast . as shown in figure both the and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ proteins interact with _PROTEIN_ but the _PROTEIN_ substitution renders _PROTEIN_ unable to interact with _PROTEIN_ suggesting that as in the b box containing proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ a vp pair in the c terminus is required for the interaction with _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ protein localizes to _LOCATION_ speckles in the dark and the _LOCATION_ abundance of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the light . furthermore _PROTEIN_ has been found to colocalize with several interaction partners such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ hfr and the _PROTEIN_ domain of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ speckles when _PROTEIN_ in onion epidermal cells . both _PROTEIN_ and hfr localize to _LOCATION_ speckles when _PROTEIN_ in onion cells but _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ give a diffuse _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ when _PROTEIN_ alone and require coexpression of _PROTEIN_ for speckle localization . we made two green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion constructs to examine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ containing the entire coding sequence of _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ lacking amino acids to encoding the b box domains . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein is exclusively _LOCATION_ when _PROTEIN_ in onion cells and it localizes to _LOCATION_ speckles both in the dark and in the light . the speckles were consistently smaller and more numerous in cells incubated in the dark compared with cells incubated in the light . by contrast no speckles were observed for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the truncated _PROTEIN_ protein was predominantly _LOCATION_ and gave a diffuse _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ both in the dark and in the light . thus the n terminal b boxes in _PROTEIN_ are required for _PROTEIN_ to localize to speckles whereas the c terminus is required for interaction with _PROTEIN_ in yeast . _METHOD_ fusions of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ give diffuse _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ when _PROTEIN_ alone but localize to speckles when coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ . to test whether overexpression of _PROTEIN_ also can localize _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to speckles we coexpressed the two proteins and found that in these cells _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localized to speckles . because both full length _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ localize to speckles we set out to examine whether the two proteins are found in the same subnuclear structures using the _METHOD_ resonance energy transfer technique . to this end we coexpressed cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fused _PROTEIN_ with yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fused _PROTEIN_ and analyzed fret by acceptor photobleaching using a confocal microscope . as shown in the top panels of figure a _LOCATION_ coexpressing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ excited with and nm lasers resulted in the emission of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ respectively before the nm bleach of the region of interest . after the bleach emission from _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the region of interest was reduced dramatically whereas we saw a clear increase in the emission of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the region of interest indicating that fret had occurred . the relative intensities of emissions from _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the region of interest before and after bleach are shown in figure . to further characterize the role of _PROTEIN_ in plants we screened the arabidopsis knockout collection at madison wisconsin for t dna insertions in the _PROTEIN_ gene . the collection was screened with primers annealing to sequences and of _PROTEIN_ and we identified a t dna insertion within the gene . the same t dna insertion was identified with both and primers suggesting that the insertion consists of at least two t dnas inserted in a head to head orientation . sequencing of the flanking regions revealed that the t dna was inserted in the first exon at nucleotide position from the translational start site . the t dna results in the insertion of codons for the amino acids _PROTEIN_ followed by a stop codon after glu in _PROTEIN_ . rna gel blot hybridization revealed that a truncated mrna is _PROTEIN_ at wild type levels in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the truncated mrna in _PROTEIN_ was amplified with rt pcr and sequencing confirmed that an mrna fusion between _PROTEIN_ and the t dna was transcribed . the t dna line was backcrossed into the wild type and crossed into _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ alleles . analyses of these crosses revealed a single t dna locus cosegregating with the phenotype conferred by _PROTEIN_ . to confirm that any observed phenotypes were indeed caused by disruption of the _PROTEIN_ gene we introduced a bp genomic construct containing the _PROTEIN_ gene and bp and bp sequences into the _PROTEIN_ mutant as well as into each of the _PROTEIN_ double mutants . for these genomic complementation experiments we used the _METHOD_ vector which allowed analysis in the generation . to examine whether _PROTEIN_ is involved in light responses _PROTEIN_ seedlings were germinated in different fluences of blue red and far red light . the _PROTEIN_ seedlings did not differ significantly from wild type seedlings in blue or far red light but had longer hypocotyls in high fluence red light . the finding that _PROTEIN_ is specifically hyposensitive to high fluence red light suggests that _PROTEIN_ acts as a positive regulator of the phytochrome mediated inhibition of hypocotyl elongation . transgenic _PROTEIN_ seedlings transformed with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ displayed hypocotyl lengths similar to wild type plants indicating that a functional _PROTEIN_ gene could complement the phenotype conferred by _PROTEIN_ in red light . analysis of a segregating _PROTEIN_ population revealed that the _PROTEIN_ mutation is recessive . the complementation experiments and the recessive nature of the _PROTEIN_ mutation are consistent with _PROTEIN_ being a loss of function mutation . we then examined _PROTEIN_ seedlings grown in white light under different daylength conditions . we found no significant difference between wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings in constant light or under long day conditions but _PROTEIN_ showed reduced inhibition of hypocotyl elongation in short day conditions . also this phenotype was complemented in transgenic _PROTEIN_ seedlings transformed with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the mutation resulted in reduced inhibition of hypocotyl elongation in all light conditions . we generated a _PROTEIN_ double mutant and examined the hypocotyl length in different light conditions . in all conditions tested _PROTEIN_ behaved like the mutation . _PROTEIN_ the founding member of the _PROTEIN_ like family was identified as a _PROTEIN_ promoting flowering in long days . to examine whether _PROTEIN_ affects flowering time we compared _PROTEIN_ with co grown in short days and long days respectively . we found that _PROTEIN_ plants flower earlier than wild type plants in both short and long days . the early flowering seen in long day grown _PROTEIN_ plants is opposite that seen in co but similar to the early flowering seen in mutations in the genes encoding two _PROTEIN_ interacting proteins and hyh whereas neither _PROTEIN_ nor _PROTEIN_ affects flowering time . when grown in short day conditions _PROTEIN_ plants were taller and their primary shoots had fewer _PROTEIN_ branches than those of wild type plants . neither the wild type nor _PROTEIN_ produced secondary shoots under our short day growth conditions . the elongated shoot and reduced branching phenotypes were observed only in short day conditions no significant difference in either height or branching was seen between _PROTEIN_ and the wild type under long day conditions . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ promotes the formation of branches and inhibits the growth of the primary shoot specifically during short days . the observation that the _PROTEIN_ mutation affects the growth of the shoot prompted us to examine whether _PROTEIN_ has any effect on root growth . to this end we germinated _PROTEIN_ and wild type seeds on vertical plates in constant white light and measured the growth of the primary root . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ seedlings had shorter primary roots than wild type seedlings . the difference in root length was most pronounced at day after germination and _PROTEIN_ at _PROTEIN_ time points . interestingly we found that _PROTEIN_ seedlings produced fewer _PROTEIN_ roots than wild type seedlings . _PROTEIN_ seedlings transformed with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ displayed wild type primary root length and number of _PROTEIN_ roots indicating that the _PROTEIN_ gene complemented both phenotypes . because the reduction of _PROTEIN_ branches in the shoot was seen in short day conditions only we examined _PROTEIN_ root formation in both short and long days but similar results were obtained in all three light conditions indicating that the _PROTEIN_ root phenotype unlike the branching phenotype is independent of daylength . both _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ regulated transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ affect _PROTEIN_ root formation . the _PROTEIN_ mutation reduces the number of _PROTEIN_ roots whereas the mutation enhances both the initiation and elongation of _PROTEIN_ roots . in addition to the _PROTEIN_ root phenotype seedlings show altered gravitropic and touching responses enhanced cell elongation in root hairs and reduced greening and secondary _PROTEIN_ of the root . we examined whether _PROTEIN_ affects any of these processes but we found no difference in gravitropic responses greening secondary _PROTEIN_ or root hair elongation between _PROTEIN_ and the wild type . to examine the genetic relationship between _PROTEIN_ and on _PROTEIN_ root formation _PROTEIN_ double mutant seedlings were analyzed . the double mutants were indistinguishable from suggesting that is epistatic to _PROTEIN_ with respect to _PROTEIN_ root formation . we generated double mutants between _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ alleles _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as well as with _PROTEIN_ to examine the genetic relationships between these genes . _PROTEIN_ seedlings germinated in the dark were indistinguishable from wild type plants . however when the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants were germinated in the dark we found that the double mutants had longer hypocotyls than either the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ single mutant indicating that _PROTEIN_ can partially suppress the hypocotyl phenotype of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the dark . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings transformed with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ displayed hypocotyl lengths similar to those of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutants indicating that a functional _PROTEIN_ gene could reverse the _PROTEIN_ dependant suppression . deetiolated _PROTEIN_ seedlings that have been germinated in darkness are sensitive to high fluence light and most of them are unable to green and will die upon transfer to white light . this _PROTEIN_ dependent block of greening phenotype follows an allelic series and becomes more pronounced the longer the seedlings have been grown in the dark . we found that a higher percentage of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings were able to green when germinated in the dark for d and then transferred to light for d compared with the _PROTEIN_ single mutant . the difference was smaller between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ acts as an allele specific suppressor of this _PROTEIN_ phenotype . we found a reduced competence to green also in _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant displayed slightly improved greening and the _PROTEIN_ suppression of _PROTEIN_ was similar in magnitude to the suppression of _PROTEIN_ . in conclusion the _PROTEIN_ mutation like the mutation can suppress the hypocotyl phenotypes of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the dark . furthermore similar to and hyh _PROTEIN_ acts as an allele specific suppressor of the _PROTEIN_ dependent block of greening phenotype . although the mutation enhances the formation of _PROTEIN_ roots both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ show reduced numbers of _PROTEIN_ roots . we consistently found a higher number of _PROTEIN_ roots formed in red light . to facilitate the analysis of the emergence of _PROTEIN_ roots in the double mutants we performed the experiments in red light . similar results albeit with fewer _PROTEIN_ roots were seen in white light . in red light _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ all showed reduced numbers of emerged _PROTEIN_ roots . when analyzing the double mutants we found that _PROTEIN_ enhanced the phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ whereas no significant difference was seen between _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ acts as an allele specific enhancer of the _PROTEIN_ root phenotype in _PROTEIN_ . surprisingly _PROTEIN_ suppresses the _PROTEIN_ root phenotype of _PROTEIN_ . the reduced number of _PROTEIN_ roots in _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ enhancement of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ root phenotypes and the suppression of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ root phenotypes were complemented in seedlings carrying a functional _PROTEIN_ gene indicating that the phenotypes were caused by the _PROTEIN_ mutation . thus although _PROTEIN_ partially suppresses the dark phenotype of weak _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ alleles alike we found very different genetic interactions in _PROTEIN_ root formation . although the _PROTEIN_ mutation partially suppresses the reduced formation of _PROTEIN_ roots in the _PROTEIN_ mutant it acts as an allele specific enhancer of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . we found that the _PROTEIN_ seedlings were slightly paler than wild type seedlings during the first days after emergence from the seed coat . we assayed chlorophyll and anthocyanin contents of the seedlings to ascertain whether _PROTEIN_ affects the accumulation of either of these pigments . we found no significant difference in chlorophyll content however _PROTEIN_ seedlings had approximately half the amount of anthocyanin compared with the wild type in both red and white light . the difference was more pronounced at day after germination and had _PROTEIN_ to at day . the reduction in anthocyanin levels in d old red light grown _PROTEIN_ seedlings was complemented in seedlings transformed with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ indicating that the phenotype was caused by the loss of the _PROTEIN_ gene . the mutation causes reduction in both chlorophyll and anthocyanin levels during deetiolation . because is epistatic to _PROTEIN_ with respect to _PROTEIN_ root formation we analyzed anthocyanin levels in the _PROTEIN_ double mutant . however we found that the effect of the _PROTEIN_ and mutations was additive in red light whereas the anthocyanin levels of _PROTEIN_ were intermediate between those of the _PROTEIN_ and mutants in white light suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and regulate anthocyanin accumulation independently . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have increased _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ synthase the first committed enzyme in the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway . to further characterize the genetic relationship between _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we analyzed anthocyanin accumulation in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . as seen in figures and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have increased levels of anthocyanin in d old seedlings germinated in red or white light . the _PROTEIN_ mutation has and fold increases in anthocyanin content compared with the wild type in red and white light respectively . the _PROTEIN_ mutation results in and fold higher anthocyanin content than the wild type in red and white light respectively . double mutant analysis revealed that _PROTEIN_ has opposite effects on anthocyanin accumulation in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings . in the case of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the anthocyanin content was reduced to and of _PROTEIN_ levels in red and white light respectively . by contrast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ had higher anthocyanin content than the _PROTEIN_ single mutant and fold above wild type levels in red and white light respectively . these results suggest that although the _PROTEIN_ mutation can suppress the accumulation of anthocyanin in both red light and white light grown _PROTEIN_ seedlings it enhances the anthocyanin accumulation in _PROTEIN_ particularly in white light .
