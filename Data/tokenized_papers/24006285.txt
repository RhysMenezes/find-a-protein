this study of the arabidopsis nitrate transporters _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ reveals how the interplay between xylem and phloem transport of nitrate ensures optimal nitrate distribution in leaves for plant growth . functional analysis in xenopus laevis oocytes showed that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are low affinity nitrate transporters . quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunoblot analysis showed higher _PROTEIN_ of these two genes in larger expanded leaves . green _METHOD_ protein and _PROTEIN_ reporter analyses indicated that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ transporters _PROTEIN_ in the companion cells of the major vein . in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants more root fed was translocated to mature and larger expanded leaves but less to the youngest tissues suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are required for transferring root derived nitrate into phloem in the major veins of mature and larger expanded leaves for redistributing to the youngest tissues . distinct from the wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants show no increase of plant growth at high nitrate supply . these data suggested that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are involved in xylem to phloem transfer for redistributing nitrate into developing leaves and such nitrate redistribution is a critical step for optimal plant growth enhanced by increasing external nitrate .
_PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ similar to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are in subgroup iv of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ family . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ share amino acid sequence identity . nitrate transporters characterized in the _PROTEIN_ family are low affinity nitrate transporters except _PROTEIN_ which is a dual affinity nitrate transporter . the high and low affinity nitrate uptake activities of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were assessed by analyzing uptake activity of complementary rna injected oocytes at mm and respectively . compared with the water injected control _PROTEIN_ crna injected xenopus laevis oocytes showed enhanced uptake activities at both mm and while _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ crna injected oocytes only exhibited enhanced uptake at mm but not at . as expected for proton coupled transporters mm nitrate uptake activities of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ crna injected oocytes at ph were and lower than those at ph respectively . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are low affinity nitrate transporters and that nitrate transport is ph dependent . nitrate transport activities of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were further confirmed by electrophysiological analysis of crna injected oocytes . as shown in figure inward currents were elicited by mm nitrate in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ crna injected oocytes suggesting that they are electrogenic transporters . some members of the _PROTEIN_ family could transport dipeptides/tripeptides . to test whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ could transport dipeptides electrophysiological analyses of crna injected oocytes exposed to gly gly and leu leu were performed . no significant current differences were detected among _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and water injected oocytes when incubated with gly gly and leu leu . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are nitrate transporters but not dipeptide transporters . to determine the affinity of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for nitrate current elicited by different concentrations of nitrate was recorded and calculated by fitting the michaelis menten equation . the km values of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are approximately and mm respectively confirming that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are low affinity nitrate transporters . _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in d old seedlings grown with different nitrogen sources such as potassium nitrate ammonium nitrate or ammonium succinate were investigated by quantitative reverse transcription pcr analysis . as shown in figure a and b _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the shoot while _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in both shoot and root . in the shoot the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ were about fold higher than in _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ levels of these two genes showed no significant difference in three different nitrogen supplemented media suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is not affected by nitrogen sources . since the dominant gene _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in shoot the _PROTEIN_ of these two genes in different leaves of d old plants was further analyzed . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was developmentally regulated with the transcript level increasing from leaf to leaf reaching the maximal level in leaf or and then declining in younger leaves . the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in different leaves were further confirmed by immunoblot analysis . consistently the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ protein levels in d old plants were higher in leaf and leaf . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels are more abundant in larger expanded leaves . to find out where _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ in actively growing leaves the kb upstream region of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was used to drive the _PROTEIN_ of the gus reporter gene and transformed into wild type columbia plants . in five independent transgenic lines for each gene gus staining in shoot was _PROTEIN_ found in major veins . this tissue specific _PROTEIN_ pattern was identical in plants grown at different nitrate concentrations . this _PROTEIN_ pattern was further confirmed by quantitative rt pcr analysis of the petiole midrib and lamina . as shown in supplemental figure the _PROTEIN_ levels in the petiole and the midrib were approximately times higher for _PROTEIN_ and four times higher for _PROTEIN_ than their respective levels in lamina . after bolting in addition to the major vein of rosette leaves the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ could also be found in the major vein of cauline leaves the junction of silique and pedicel and the apex of silique . cross sections of gus stained petiole revealed that gus signals were restricted to the phloem side of the vascular tissues . to confirm the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in phloem transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ fusion protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ driven by their native promoters were generated . as shown in figure e and f consistent with the gus staining pattern _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were located in the phloem of the major vein . in figure g and h when sieve plates were revealed by aniline blue staining the sieve elements can be recognized by the presence of sieve plates and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals were detected in the cells next to sieve elements and with similar end positions to the sieve elements suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ in companion cells . to investigate the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter were transiently _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis mesophyll protoplast . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals were found to be confined to a _PROTEIN_ external to the chloroplasts while the _METHOD_ control was seen in the cytoplasm . these results suggest that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are localized in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to determine the in vivo functions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ two independent transfer dna insertion mutants in the col ecotype were isolated for each gene . in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants the t dna was inserted in the fourth exon and the second intron of _PROTEIN_ respectively . in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants the t dna was inserted in the second intron of _PROTEIN_ . the t dna insertion was confirmed by genomic dna pcr . moreover _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ protein could not be detected in the mutants by immunoblot analysis using _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ specific antibody suggesting that they are null mutants . in addition _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants were generated by crossing single mutants . for the allocation assay was fed to the root of wild type and mutant plants for min and then the enrichment in individual leaves was analyzed . compared with the wild type no significant differences of the enrichment were found in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutants . however as shown in figure enrichment was higher in leaves to of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants than in wild type plants . despite no statistical significance enrichment in leaf and the shoot apical meristem including emerging leaves and leaf primordium of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants was slightly lower than in the wild type . to further elucidate the relative amount of transported to larger expanded leaves versus the youngest tissues the enrichment ratios of leaf and shoot apical meristem to leaf were calculated and are shown in figure . in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant the ratios were lower than in the wild type . similar results were found in another double mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . when the data for the enrichment presented in figure a and c were recalculated and converted absolute value or relative distribution in different leaves showed a similar pattern of higher values in the mature leaves of the double mutants but lower values in the younger tissues of the double mutants . the nitrate uptake activity and shoot to root ratio between the wild type and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants showed no significant differences suggesting that the increases of in the mature leaves are not due to the enhanced uptake or the increased nitrate transport to shoot in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . these results supported the functional redundancy between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and showed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ work together to reduce the amount of nitrate transported to mature and larger expanded leaves but enhance the amount of nitrate allocated to the youngest tissues . to further confirm the contribution of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in regulating nitrate allocation into the youngest leaf nitrate content analysis was performed . in this experiment residual nitrate in the leaves was first depleted by growing plants in the nitrate free medium for d. in addition the nitrate reductase inhibitor tungstate was added to repress the rapid nitrate reduction in the leaf . as shown in figure nitrate concentration change in the youngest leaf of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant after shifting to nitrate containing medium for h was lower than in the wild type . this result together with the distribution experiments supported that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are involved in nitrate allocation to the youngest leaf . we next examined whether the loss of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ has any effect on leaf growth by measuring the dry weights of individual true leaves in double mutants . as shown in figure increases of nitrate concentration from mm to or mm were associated with increased growth in the wild type particularly in younger leaves leaf and up . however in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants no increase of the growth of younger leaves was observed when the nitrate concentrations were increased . these results suggest that nitrate redistribution mediated by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is important for enhancing the growth of younger leaves at high nitrate concentrations .
