the a/t rich interaction domain and the _PROTEIN_ box domain represent dna interaction modules that are found in sequence specific as well as nonsequence specific dna binding proteins . both domains are found in a variety of dna interacting proteins in a wide range of eukaryotic _METHOD_ . proteins that contain both an arid and an _PROTEIN_ box domain here termed arid _PROTEIN_ proteins appear to be specific for plants . this protein family is conserved in higher plants as well as lower plants such as the moss physcomitrella . since arid _PROTEIN_ proteins have not been studied experimentally we have examined here two family members from arabidopsis . the genes encoding arid _PROTEIN_ and arid _PROTEIN_ are widely _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis but at different levels . subcellular localization experiments studying arid _PROTEIN_ and arid _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ by _METHOD_ microscopy show that both proteins localize primarily to cell _LOCATION_ . analyses of the dna binding properties using electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that mediated by the _PROTEIN_ box domain arid _PROTEIN_ binds structure specifically to dna minicircles . mediated by the arid the protein binds preferentially to a/t rich dna when compared with g/c rich dna . therefore both dna binding domains contribute to the dna interactions of arid _PROTEIN_ . accordingly the protein combines dna binding properties characteristic of arid and _PROTEIN_ box proteins .
to get an overview about the plant proteins that contain both an arid and an _PROTEIN_ box domain we searched the arabidopsis database and the plant chromatin database . our survey yielded a number of amino acid sequences containing both types of dna binding domains . thus the genome of the dicot plant arabidopsis codes for four sequences while the genome of the monocot plant rice encodes two proteins of this type . in line with earlier observations citation proteins containing both an arid and an _PROTEIN_ box domain termed here arid _PROTEIN_ appear to be specific for plants because we did not find related sequences in other _METHOD_ when searching genbank . in addition to higher plants we identified a related protein that is encoded in the genome of the moss physcomitrella patens . therefore arid _PROTEIN_ proteins occur in higher and lower plant species . the overall structure of arid _PROTEIN_ proteins is relatively conserved among the proteins of different species . they contain an arid in the n terminal part while the _PROTEIN_ box resides within the c terminal part of the proteins . the amino acid sequences of the arid _PROTEIN_ proteins from arabidopsis poplar rice maize and physcomitrella were used for construction of a neighbor joining tree that showed that the proteins group into subfamilies . thus zm _PROTEIN_ and os _PROTEIN_ form for instance a monocot specific branch while the branches around arid _PROTEIN_ at _PROTEIN_ and pt _PROTEIN_ or at _PROTEIN_ pt _PROTEIN_ and pt _PROTEIN_ are dicot specific . the group around arid _PROTEIN_ appears to occur in both mono and dicot plants . a multiple sequence alignment of the amino acid sequences revealed that the arids and _PROTEIN_ box domains are well conserved among the arid _PROTEIN_ proteins . outside the two domains only a short region of residues situated between the two domains is well conserved among the different arid _PROTEIN_ proteins . within the arid five residues found to be characteristic of animal arids citation are well conserved among the arids of plant arid _PROTEIN_ proteins . similarly the sequence around the primary dna intercalating residue and the invariant tryptophan residue of the _PROTEIN_ box domains citation is conserved in the _PROTEIN_ box domains of arid _PROTEIN_ proteins while the sequence around the position of the secondary dna intercalating residue is less conserved . of the four arabidopsis genes encoding arid _PROTEIN_ proteins according to the arabidopsis database currently there is no evidence for _PROTEIN_ for the gene _GENE_ while appears to be _PROTEIN_ at very low levels . therefore we have chosen the kda arid _PROTEIN_ and the kda arid _PROTEIN_ for experimental analysis . to examine the _PROTEIN_ of the two genes encoding these proteins in arabidopsis rna was isolated from different tissues and after reverse transcription it was used for estimating relative transcript levels by pcr . using arid _PROTEIN_ specific primers the amplification product was obtained from all rna samples but with very different efficiency . thus the transcript level is clearly higher in leaves flower buds and seedlings compared to roots cultured cells and seeds . by contrast the arid _PROTEIN_ specific pcr product is detected similarly with all rna samples indicating that this gene is _PROTEIN_ at comparable levels in all tissues similar to the rna control . the rtpcr experiment shows that the two arid _PROTEIN_ genes are widely _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis and that the _PROTEIN_ levels of arid _PROTEIN_ differ between different tissues . in animals there are arid containing proteins that display a broad _PROTEIN_ pattern while other family members are _PROTEIN_ in a tissue specific manner citation . similarly some animal _PROTEIN_ box proteins are broadly _PROTEIN_ while others have a more restricted _PROTEIN_ pattern citation . in plants _PROTEIN_ box proteins of the _PROTEIN_ family citation and of the _PROTEIN_ family citation are widely _PROTEIN_ . according to predictions using the software psort _METHOD_ arid _PROTEIN_ and arid _PROTEIN_ are _LOCATION_ proteins but predictions of the subcellular localization of proteins currently are not very accurate citation . therefore we have examined the subcellular localization of the two arabidopsis proteins . we have constructed plasmids suitable for _PROTEIN_ of n terminal _METHOD_ fusion proteins in plant protoplasts . in transient transformation assays performed with tobacco by suspension cell protoplasts the _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ fusion proteins was driven by the camv promoter . transformed protoplasts were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy . we have used constructs that served as controls in this experiment _METHOD_ that is found in both the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ and _METHOD_ nls _PROTEIN_ nes that accumulates in the _LOCATION_ due to a strong functional basic _LOCATION_ localization signal citation . _METHOD_ arid _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ arid _PROTEIN_ show a prominent localization in the _LOCATION_ . however they did not completely accumulate in the _LOCATION_ compartment like the control _METHOD_ nls _PROTEIN_ nes or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ citation . with both _METHOD_ arid _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ arid _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was also observed in the _LOCATION_ that is much weaker than that in the _LOCATION_ but clearly detectable . part of this finding could be due to the overexpression of the _METHOD_ fusion proteins in the protoplasts . on the other hand control _METHOD_ fusion proteins containing strong nlss did not show this effect in the same system . alternatively the weak _LOCATION_ signal of _METHOD_ arid _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ arid _PROTEIN_ may indicate the presence of relatively weak nlss in these proteins and/or their association with as yet unknown partner in the _LOCATION_ . the occurrence of speckles in the _LOCATION_ may favor the latter view . to examine the dna binding properties of arid _PROTEIN_ we set out to produce in e. coli the full length protein and individual domains . despite testing a variety of conditions we were unable to produce soluble his tagged arid _PROTEIN_ . however we succeeded in producing arid _PROTEIN_ fused to gluthatione s transferase _PROTEIN_ albeit the _PROTEIN_ level was relatively low . despite testing various conditions we were unable to produce the individual arid in e. coli whereas the individual _PROTEIN_ box domain could be _PROTEIN_ efficiently as his tagged protein . the _PROTEIN_ arid _PROTEIN_ fusion was purified by affinity chromatography while the _PROTEIN_ box domain was purified by three step column chromatography . _PROTEIN_ analysis of the purified proteins revealed that both _PROTEIN_ arid _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ box domain are essentially pure . using cd spectroscopy we have examined the _PROTEIN_ box domain of arid _PROTEIN_ . cd wavelength scans were recorded in the range of nm . the spectrum displays a shape typical of helical proteins having the characteristic local minima around and nm . as seen with _PROTEIN_ box domains of plant _PROTEIN_ proteins citation the cd measurements indicate that the _PROTEIN_ box domain of arid _PROTEIN_ has an helical structure consistent with the solved structures of a number of _PROTEIN_ box domains citation . it is well documented that plant _PROTEIN_ proteins and _PROTEIN_ mediated by their _PROTEIN_ box domains bind dna nonsequence specifically but they interact with high affinity with certain dna structures including dna minicircles and four way junctions citation . purified full length arid _PROTEIN_ and the individual _PROTEIN_ box domain were examined for structure specific dna binding using electrophoretic mobility shift assays _METHOD_ . for comparison we have used the _PROTEIN_ box domain of the well characterized maize _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ citation . increasing amounts of the three proteins were incubated with a mixture of linear and circularized bp dna fragment and dna binding was examined by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the samples . with increasing protein input protein/dna complexes with reduced electrophoretic mobility appear demonstrating that the proteins bind to dna . the three proteins bind structure specifically to the minicircle dna since compared to the minicircle dna binding to linear dna requires higher protein concentrations . this is seen very clearly with the reference protein zm _PROTEIN_ which from a concentration of nm binds the dna minicircle while binding to the linear fragment requires a protein concentration of nm . compared to the maize _PROTEIN_ the affinity for dna of the arid _PROTEIN_ is lower . thus arid _PROTEIN_ box binds the minicircle from a concentration of nm and no interaction with the linear fragment is seen at nm . however the two _PROTEIN_ box domains form the same type of complexes with the minicircle dna . therefore the dna binding properties of the arid _PROTEIN_ resemble those of the _PROTEIN_ box domain of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ type protein _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ since this protein also binds dna minicircles structure specifically but it has a generally reduced affinity for dna when compared to the zm _PROTEIN_ citation . as seen by the _PROTEIN_ amount of the unbound dna band full length arid _PROTEIN_ binds the minicircle from a concentration of nm and the linear fragment from a concentration of nm . in contrast to the _PROTEIN_ box domains with full length arid _PROTEIN_ no distinct complexes are formed but the protein bound dna rather appears to accumulate in the wells of the gel . a similar effect was seen with the full length maize _PROTEIN_ protein but not with the individual _PROTEIN_ citation . the _METHOD_ experiment shows that both arid _PROTEIN_ and full length arid _PROTEIN_ bind dna structure specifically and it appears that this property is mediated by the _PROTEIN_ box domain . the significantly higher affinity for dna of full length arid _PROTEIN_ relative to the individual arid _PROTEIN_ most likely is due to the presence of the arid domain in the full length protein generally enhancing the affinity for dna . therefore our experiments indicate that both the arid and the _PROTEIN_ box domain contribute to the dna binding of arid _PROTEIN_ . some mammalian arid containing proteins interact preferentially with a/t rich dna sites while other members of the arid family do not share this property citation . therefore recognition of a/t sites is not an intrinsic feature of the domain . we have compared dna binding of full length arid _PROTEIN_ to a/t rich and g/c rich dna . increasing amounts of the protein were incubated with bp dna fragments and dna binding was examined by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the samples . with the a/t rich dna fragment binding was observed from a concentration of nm as evident from the appearance of a distinct protein/dna complex . at higher protein concentrations additional complexes of lower electrophoretic mobility appeared . with the g/c rich fragment protein binding was observed only from a concentration of nm indicating that arid _PROTEIN_ displays a higher affinity for a/t rich dna . moreover distinct complexes like those formed with the a/t rich fragment were not seen with the g/c rich fragment . since no binding to the a/t and g/c rich fragments was observed with the individual _PROTEIN_ box domain of arid _PROTEIN_ most likely the binding of arid _PROTEIN_ to the linear dna fragments can be attributed to interactions . this is consistent with the _METHOD_ using the bp linear fragment and minicircle where binding to the linear fragment is only observed for arid _PROTEIN_ but not for the individual arid _PROTEIN_ . in summary our dna binding experiments show that like _PROTEIN_ arid _PROTEIN_ belongs the group of arid proteins that bind preferentially a/t rich dna . mediated by the _PROTEIN_ box domain arid _PROTEIN_ can bind dna structure specifically . accordingly both the arid and the _PROTEIN_ box domain contribute to the dna interactions of arid _PROTEIN_ giving the protein characteristics of arid and _PROTEIN_ box proteins .
the sequence encoding arid _PROTEIN_ was amplified by pcr using deepvent dna polymerase primers and and an arabidopsis cdna library as template . the pcr fragment was digested with bamhi/hindiii at terminal restriction enzyme recognition sites and cloned into the bamhi/hindiii digested plasmid giving arid _PROTEIN_ . similarly the sequence encoding arid _PROTEIN_ was amplified by pcr using primers and and cloned into bamhi/hindiii digested plasmid giving arid _PROTEIN_ . the sequence encoding the _PROTEIN_ box domain of arid _PROTEIN_ was also amplified by pcr using primers and and cloned into bamhi/hindiii digested plasmid giving arid _PROTEIN_ . plasmid arid _PROTEIN_ was consecutively treated with hindiii klenow enzyme and bamhi and the sequence encoding arid _PROTEIN_ was cloned into bamhi/smai digested pgex giving pgex arid _PROTEIN_ . plasmids arid _PROTEIN_ and arid _PROTEIN_ were consecutively treated with hindiii klenow enzyme and ecori and the sequences encoding arid _PROTEIN_ and arid _PROTEIN_ were cloned into ecori/smai digested _METHOD_ citation giving _METHOD_ arid _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ arid _PROTEIN_ . all plasmid constructions were checked by dna sequencing . full length arid _PROTEIN_ fused to glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli using the plasmid pgex arid _PROTEIN_ and purified by affinity chromatography using as previously described citation except that the protein was eluted with mm reduced glutathione in mm tris hcl ph . his tagged _PROTEIN_ box domains of maize _PROTEIN_ and arabidopsis arid _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ in e. coli using the plasmids cm _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ citation and arid _PROTEIN_ and purified by three step column chromatography as previously described citation . purified recombinant proteins were checked for purity by _PROTEIN_ and maldi tof _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . cd measurements using arid _PROTEIN_ were performed using a jasco j instrument as described previously citation . a. thaliana ecotype col was grown under long day conditions as previously described citation . total rna was extracted from mg of frozen plant tissue using the _PROTEIN_ method and treated with dnase . reverse transcription was performed using of rna and revert aid h minus m mulv reverse transcriptase . the obtained cdna was used for pcr analyses using taq dna polymerase and oligonucleotide primers specific for arid _PROTEIN_ arid _PROTEIN_ and rna . protoplasts were prepared from dark grown tobacco by cells and transiently transformed with plasmids encoding _METHOD_ fusions by peg mediated transformation as described previously citation . excitation of _METHOD_ was performed with a standard uv light source and fluorescein isothiocyanate filters . for confocal laser scanning microscopy samples were directly examined under oil with a objective and a dm re microscope equipped with an laser _METHOD_ . analysis of the localization of the _METHOD_ fusion proteins was performed in three independent experiments representing approximately transformed protoplasts . structure specific dna binding of recombinant proteins was examined by _METHOD_ using a mixture of linear and circularized bp kpni/xbai dna fragment originating from pbluescript . the circularized form of the fragment was produced by intramolecular ligation of the labeled fragment using dna ligase in the presence of recombinant maize _PROTEIN_ as described previously citation . proteins were incubated with the dna in a final volume of of binding buffer for min . to test protein binding to a/t and g/c rich dna bp dna fragments of the _PROTEIN_ promoter region were amplified by pcr from genomic physcomitrella dna and labeled as previously described citation . protein binding reactions with the a/t and g/c rich fragments were performed as described above . all binding reactions were analyzed in polyacrylamide gels in tbe and the dna was visualized by phosphorimaging using a typhoon instrument .
