a common feature of plant defense responses is the transcriptional regulation of a large number of genes upon pathogen infection or treatment with pathogen elicitors . a large body of evidence suggests that plant wrky transcription _PROTEIN_ are involved in plant defense including transcriptional regulation of plant host genes in response to pathogen infection . however there is only limited information about the roles of specific wrky dna binding transcription _PROTEIN_ in plant defense . we analyzed the role of the _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis in plant defense against the bacterial pathogen pseudomonas syringae . _PROTEIN_ protein recognizes the _PROTEIN_ w box sequences and its translational fusion with green _METHOD_ protein is localized to the _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is responsive to general environmental stress . analysis of stress induced _PROTEIN_ in the defense signaling mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ further indicated that this gene is positively regulated by the salicylic acid signaling pathway and negatively regulated by the jasmonic acid signaling pathway . two independent t dna insertion mutants for _PROTEIN_ supported normal growth of a virulent strain of p. syringae but developed reduced disease _METHOD_ after infection . by contrast arabidopsis constitutively overexpressing _PROTEIN_ supported enhanced growth of p. syringae and displayed increased disease symptom severity as compared to wild type plants . these _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants also displayed reduced _PROTEIN_ of the sa regulated _PROTEIN_ gene after the pathogen infection despite normal levels of free sa . the _LOCATION_ localization and sequence specific dna binding activity support that _PROTEIN_ functions as a transcription _PROTEIN_ . based on analysis of both t dna insertion mutants and transgenic overexpression lines stress induced _PROTEIN_ functions as a negative regulator of sa mediated defense responses to p. syringae . this proposed role is consistent with the recent finding that _PROTEIN_ is a substrate of arabidopsis map kinase a repressor of sa dependent defense responses .
arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ encodes a protein of amino acids with a molecular weight of kd and an isolelectric point of . based on the presence of two wrky domains _PROTEIN_ is classified as a group i wrky protein . the n terminus and the region between the wrky domains are rich in serine and/or threonine residues . thus _PROTEIN_ may be regulated at least in part via protein phosphorylation by a protein kinase such as _PROTEIN_ . wrky transcription _PROTEIN_ are thought to function by binding their cognate _PROTEIN_ w box cis elements in the promoter regions of target genes and activating or repressing their _PROTEIN_ . a number of isolated wrky proteins have been shown to bind w box sequences _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to examine the dna binding activity of _PROTEIN_ we _PROTEIN_ the gene in e. coli purified the recombinant protein and assayed its binding to an oligonucleotide that contains two direct _PROTEIN_ repeats using _METHOD_ . several _PROTEIN_ complexes with differing mobility were detected when purified recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein was incubated with the probe . whether the different complexes represent probes in which one or both of the w boxes are bound by _PROTEIN_ or whether they are caused by formation of monomeric and oligomeric _PROTEIN_ complexes is unclear . alternatively some of these complexes might result from protein degradation or incompletely translation of the _PROTEIN_ gene . binding of _PROTEIN_ was not detected with a mutant probe in which both _PROTEIN_ sequences were changed to _PROTEIN_ . thus binding of _PROTEIN_ to the _PROTEIN_ w box sequence is highly specific . if _PROTEIN_ is a transcription _PROTEIN_ it is likely to be localized in the _LOCATION_ . the presence of putative _LOCATION_ localization signal predicted by the psort ii program is consistent with this possibility . to determine the subcellular location of _PROTEIN_ we constructed a _METHOD_ protein fusion of _PROTEIN_ . the fusion construct driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter was directly bombarded into onion epidermal cells . as shown in figure the transiently _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was localized exclusively to the _LOCATION_ . by contrast _METHOD_ was found in both the _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm due to its small size . a possible role for _PROTEIN_ during defense signaling was further investigated by analyzing its _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis after inoculation with . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ mrna levels increase in wild type plants after infiltration with either the control solution or the bacterial suspension . however _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was prolonged in pathogen infected plants as transcript levels remained elevated at hours post infiltration whereas they were nearly undetectable in treated plant at this time . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is influenced by the sa et and/or ja signaling pathways _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was monitored in various signaling mutants . induced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was modestly reduced in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants which are defective in sa signaling and biosynthesis respectively . by contrast no significant difference was observed in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ between the wild type plants and the et insensitive _PROTEIN_ mutant plants following mock or pathogen inoculation . analysis of the ja insensitive _PROTEIN_ mutant revealed a delay in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ following mock inoculation however it was significantly enhanced after pathogen infiltration as compared with that observed in wild type plants . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is sensitive to environmental cues and it appears to be positively regulated by the sa signaling pathway but negatively regulated by the ja pathway . we also analyzed induction in wild type plants sprayed with water sa aminocyclopropane _PROTEIN_ acid or methyl ja . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was rapidly induced in water treated plants underscoring that the gene is very responsive to environmental stimuli . plants sprayed with sa or acc accumulated greater levels of _PROTEIN_ transcripts than water sprayed plants whereas ja treated plants accumulated less . thus both sa and et regulate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in a positive manner whereas ja has a negative effect on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to analyze the role of _PROTEIN_ in disease resistance we identified two t dna insertion mutants for _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ contains a t dna insertion in the promoter region while _PROTEIN_ contains a t dna insertion in the last intron of the _PROTEIN_ gene . homozygous mutant plants were identified by pcr with _PROTEIN_ specific primers . we then compared the wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutants for induced accumulation of _PROTEIN_ transcripts . since treatment and pathogen infection had almost the same potency in inducing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ we used only pathogen infection in these experiments . northern analysis using a full length _PROTEIN_ cdna clone as the probe detected _PROTEIN_ transcripts in wild type plants but not in _PROTEIN_ plants after pathogen infection . by contrast a _PROTEIN_ transcript of reduced size was detected in pathogen infected _PROTEIN_ plants . this transcript was not detected when the same blot was probed with a dna fragment corresponding to the region downstream of the t dna insertion site in _PROTEIN_ . thus the t dna insertion in the _PROTEIN_ mutant results in generation of a truncated _PROTEIN_ transcript that is predicted to generate a truncated _PROTEIN_ protein lacking the c terminal wrky domain which is important for dna binding . analysis of both _PROTEIN_ mutants revealed no difference in growth or morphology from that of wild type plants flowering also occurred at the normal time . following inoculation with the mutant lines supported similar levels of bacterial growth as wild type plants . however the inoculated leaves of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants consistently displayed less disease symptom than wild type plants . to examine the effect of _PROTEIN_ overexpression we generated plants containing a full length _PROTEIN_ cdna driven by the camv promoter . northern blotting identified several transgenic plants that contained elevated levels of _PROTEIN_ transcript constitutively . two transgenic lines that constitutively _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ at elevated levels and contain a single t dna locus in their genomes based on the ratio of antibiotic resistance phenotypes were chosen for further study . analysis of homozygous plants from both lines revealed no difference in growth or development from that of wild type plants although their leaf color appear to be slightly paler . following inoculation with the transgenic overexpression lines displayed substantially greater bacterial growth than wild type plants . the inoculated leaves of _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants also developed more severe disease _METHOD_ than those of wild type plants after infection . to study the molecular basis for the altered responses to infection _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ was monitored . consistent with the enhanced susceptibility phenotype _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines contained substantially lower levels of _PROTEIN_ transcripts than wild type plants . in contrast _PROTEIN_ transcript levels in the _PROTEIN_ mutants were comparable to those in wild type plants . to determine whether altered _PROTEIN_ induction in the _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants correlated with reduced sa accumulation the levels of both free sa and sa _PROTEIN_ conjugates were monitored . both wild type plants and the t dna insertion mutants displayed similar levels of free sa and sag following infection . free sa levels in _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants were comparable to those in wild type plants at and hpi however the level of free sa at hpi was somewhat lower than in wild type plants . sag levels in uninoculated _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants also were fold lower than those in wild type plants although they rose to nearly wild type levels after infection .
