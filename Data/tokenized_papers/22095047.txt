transcriptional activities of plants play important roles in responses to environmental stresses . ethylene response _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is a drought induced transcription _PROTEIN_ that belongs to the _PROTEIN_ superfamily and has a highly conserved _PROTEIN_ domain . it can regulate drought responsive gene _PROTEIN_ by binding to the gcc box and/or the dehydration responsive element in the promoter of downstream genes . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter resulted in an unstable drought tolerant phenotype in transgenic arabidopsis plants . using a yeast two hybrid screen we identified a _PROTEIN_ domain ubiquitin ligase _PROTEIN_ which interacts with _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ . the copine domain of _PROTEIN_ exhibited the strongest interacting activity . we also demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ could move from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ under stress treatment . using an in vitro ubiquitination assay _PROTEIN_ and its closest sequelog _PROTEIN_ were shown to have ligase activity and mediated _PROTEIN_ ubiquitination for proteasome degradation . the _PROTEIN_ double mutant but not the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ single mutant exhibited a drought tolerant phenotype when compared with wild type plants . _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ proteins _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ double mutants were stable . the _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ showed enhanced _PROTEIN_ regulated gene _PROTEIN_ and had greater tolerance to drought stress than the _PROTEIN_ double mutant . in conclusion _PROTEIN_ negatively regulates the drought stress response by mediating _PROTEIN_ transcriptional activity in arabidopsis .
_PROTEIN_ patterns of the _PROTEIN_ gene were analyzed under various abiotic stress conditions and hormone treatments using rna gel blot analysis with total rna isolated from week old arabidopsis ecotype columbia plants grown on murashige and skoog _METHOD_ agar medium . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ could not be detected under normal growth conditions . rna gel blot results showed that _PROTEIN_ transcript accumulation was induced within min after exposure to dehydration and salt treatments . under drought and salt treatments _PROTEIN_ reached its highest transcript level at the h time point . the increase in _PROTEIN_ transcript levels occurred before the increase in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which was detected h after stress treatment . the rna gel blot analysis also showed that the transcript level was not induced within h after application of aba jasmonic acid or aminocyclopropane _PROTEIN_ whereas the marker gene _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed specific induced _PROTEIN_ . histochemical analysis of gus _PROTEIN_ in transgenic plants showed that there was no gus _PROTEIN_ under normal growth conditions . seven day old seedlings and and week old transgenic plants were analyzed after h of drought treatment and min of rehydration . in d old seedlings transgenic plants showed weak gus activity in the shoot apical meristem and vascular tissues in leaves and roots . in week old transgenic plants gus activity was observed in leaves and roots especially in vascular bundles . the gus activity did not occur in guard cells of leaves . in week old transgenic plants gus activity was observed in all tissues examined with low activity in flowers and siliques . _PROTEIN_ was detected in sepals of very young closed buds . when the sepals and _PROTEIN_ withered _PROTEIN_ was detected at the bottom of the silique in the abscission zone and in the pedicel region below that . strong gus _PROTEIN_ was observed in the vasculature of most tissues . for subcellular localization of the protein _PROTEIN_ cdna was fused in frame to the c terminal side of the _METHOD_ marker gene and the resulting construct was introduced into protoplasts isolated from arabidopsis together with the construct carrying nls _METHOD_ by polyethylene glycol mediated transformation . the nls _METHOD_ construct served as a positive _LOCATION_ targeting control . green and red _METHOD_ were detected in _LOCATION_ . transgenic arabidopsis constitutively _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cdna _PROTEIN_ was generated . we compared the drought stress tolerance of the _PROTEIN_ plants with that of wild type plants . we found that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ in transgenic plants did not cause improved stress tolerance suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ protein is unstable or requires posttranslational modification for its activation . transgenic arabidopsis plants harboring an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct driven by the promoter were generated in an attempt to determine _PROTEIN_ protein stability in cells . as shown in figure the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene was highly _PROTEIN_ in transgenic plants under normal growth conditions but the _METHOD_ fusion protein was not detected in western blot analysis . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein was not detected in either roots or leaves under normal growth conditions . however when these plants were treated with the proteasome inhibitor clear _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed microscopically in both roots and cotyledons . _METHOD_ fusion proteins were also detected in the western blot analysis . although the _PROTEIN_ transgene was _PROTEIN_ under normal growth conditions the corresponding protein is apparently unstable and may be degraded by the proteasome . a yeast two hybrid screen was performed to identify proteins that interact with _PROTEIN_ . full length _PROTEIN_ was fused to the yeast dna binding domain and used as a bait protein for screening against an arabidopsis cdna library fused to the yeast activation domain . approximately yeast transformants were screened on a synthetic defined medium lacking trp leu and his plus mm amino triazole . forty five positive clones were obtained and the galactosidase activity was individually assessed for all of these clones . sequence determination from the clone exhibiting the strongest activity identified a _PROTEIN_ domain containing protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . according to a previous study the _PROTEIN_ structure is shown in figure . _PROTEIN_ proteins contain a so called copine _PROTEIN_ domain . using protein analysis _METHOD_ such as pfam no transmembrane domain was indicated . therefore we designed three different fragments of _PROTEIN_ according to the structure and fused them to the yeast ad vector and each construct was cotransformed into yeast cells with the _PROTEIN_ bait vector . all three kinds of transformed yeast cells could grow well even under several selective conditions . the growth of the yeast cells transformed with negative control vectors was completely inhibited . a galactosidase activity assay was performed to verify the interacting activity of the five fragments with the bait mentioned above . the fragment including the copine region of the _PROTEIN_ fragment between amino acids and exhibited the highest galactosidase activity supporting this fragment having the strongest interacting activity with _PROTEIN_ . and it is sufficient for the protein protein interaction with _PROTEIN_ . this fragment was designed according to the sequence results of yeast two hybrid screening suggesting that there might be some posttranscriptional modification of _PROTEIN_ mrna or posttranslational modification of the _PROTEIN_ protein . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ a sequelog of _PROTEIN_ also interacts with _PROTEIN_ full length _PROTEIN_ was constructed in the yeast ad vector and tested in yeast two hybrid assays . when the construct was transformed into yeast cells containing empty or the _PROTEIN_ bait construct all cells could grow on sd/ l t plates . but on the selective medium sd/ l t h a only yeast cells transformed with the constructs _PROTEIN_ ad and _PROTEIN_ bd or t ad and bd could grow well . to further confirm the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in vivo we first checked the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ in the protoplasts . the protoplasts were transformed with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct by peg mediated transformation and observed with _METHOD_ microscopy . some _METHOD_ signals were observed at the margin of the protoplasts with lots of accumulated foci in about of transformed protoplasts and some _METHOD_ signals were observed in the _LOCATION_ in about of transformed protoplasts . to explain this result we further examined the localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants under normal conditions and under salt stress . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ translocalized from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ into the _LOCATION_ under salt stress . in vitro pull down assays were performed to test the interaction between the full length _PROTEIN_ protein and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was fused to the c terminus of the glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ tag in the pgex vector and _PROTEIN_ was fused to the thioredoxin tag in the vector . as a result the full length trx _PROTEIN_ could be pulled down by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . a bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation system was also used to study the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in plant cells . _PROTEIN_ was fused to the c terminal region of the cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ cdna was fused to the n terminal region of venus . the two constructs were cotransfected into arabidopsis protoplasts . the empty vectors in combination with each fusion construct were also cotransfected into arabidopsis protoplasts as negative controls . after about h of incubation yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in the _LOCATION_ of protoplasts in samples cotransfected with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and nvenus _PROTEIN_ whereas samples cotransfected with the empty vector and either _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or nvenus _PROTEIN_ did not yield any _METHOD_ signal . the bifc results of _PROTEIN_ interacting with _PROTEIN_ are also shown in supplemental figure . _METHOD_ signals were also observed in the _LOCATION_ . these results suggest that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ colocalize and interact with _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ of arabidopsis protoplasts under stress conditions . we carried out in vitro ubiquitination experiments with the _PROTEIN_ protein to confirm its function as an ligase . full length _PROTEIN_ was fused to _PROTEIN_ in the pgex vector . purified _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was mixed with his tagged ubiquitin rabbit and human . an immunoblot analysis with anti ubiquitin showed that ubiquitinated proteins were detected in the presence of all these components . furthermore an immunoblot analysis with anti _PROTEIN_ showed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the presence of ubiquitin and was attached to one ubiquitin monomer . as a result one additional higher molecular weight protein band appeared . these results suggest that the _PROTEIN_ protein can be autoubiquitinated in the presence of the and enzymes . as for _PROTEIN_ the ubiquitination assay was also performed to demonstrate its ligase activity using ubiquitin antibody . in order to determine whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ can mediate _PROTEIN_ protein ubiquitination we also conducted an in vitro ubiquitination assay using _PROTEIN_ protein as a substrate . full length _PROTEIN_ was fused to trx and a his tag in the vector and the recombinant fusion protein was purified by the his tag affinity to a nickel nitrilotriacetic acid agarose _PROTEIN_ . an immunoblot analysis with anti trx showed that a higher molecular weight shifted band was observed in the presence of ubiquitin and _PROTEIN_ or ubiquitin and _PROTEIN_ . the shifted band should correspond to one additional ubiquitin monomer attached to the substrate according to the mr. _PROTEIN_ mrnas are rather abundant and ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ but with tissue specific variations . according to the microarray data of the online arabidopsis _METHOD_ browser _METHOD_ _METHOD_ supplemental figure shows the _PROTEIN_ changes of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ during drought and salt stress treatments . during earlier drought stress treatment both genes were slightly down regulated . this might favor the transient accumulation of tf _PROTEIN_ and thus enable plants to acquire a sufficient amount of effective _PROTEIN_ to activate downstream gene _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ s closest sequelog _PROTEIN_ was not found by our yeast two hybrid screening . their functions are redundant according to citation . we hypothesized that _PROTEIN_ also participates in the interaction with _PROTEIN_ . the homozygous _PROTEIN_ double mutant showed a bush like phenotype completely lacking apical dominance . it also showed significant plant growth retardation and a _PROTEIN_ flowering phenotype compared with those of the col wild type and the two single mutants . to test the drought stress tolerance of _PROTEIN_ water was withheld from week old double mutant and wild type plants for about to d and then they were rewatered for to d. the survival rate of the _PROTEIN_ double mutant was which was significantly higher than that of wild type plants . no significant difference was observed between wild type plants and single mutants _PROTEIN_ . to confirm _PROTEIN_ s and _PROTEIN_ s functions in the stability of the _PROTEIN_ protein we transformed a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct into the _PROTEIN_ double mutant and obtained two independent transgenic lines . real time reverse transcription pcr revealed that the transgene _PROTEIN_ in both double mutant and wild type backgrounds was relatively high whereas _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ at very low levels under normal nonstressed conditions in wild type plants . interestingly green _METHOD_ signals were observed in _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ but not _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants . we performed an immunoblot analysis to detect the _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ fusion protein in transgenic plants using anti _METHOD_ . a protein band of approximately kd which is the predicted _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ molecular _METHOD_ was detected in two independent _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic lines . however no _METHOD_ fusion protein was detected in two _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic lines . to examine the potential _PROTEIN_ regulated genes the _PROTEIN_ of several drought responsive genes such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was tested using real time pcr in transgenic plants . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was compared in two different lines from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ was greater in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ than in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the _PROTEIN_ overexpressor even under nonstressed conditions . drought tolerance tests of _PROTEIN_ double mutants and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants were also performed . after withholding water for about d _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants showed much greater drought tolerance than _PROTEIN_ double mutants . we also compared the drought tolerance between the wild type _PROTEIN_ double mutants and the _PROTEIN_ overexpressor which is supposed to be like _PROTEIN_ knockout mutants . after withholding water for about d both the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ overexpressor showed a non drought tolerant phenotype while _PROTEIN_ double mutants showed greater drought tolerance than the _PROTEIN_ overexpressor . we have also examined the pro contents in the wild type double mutants and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . as shown in supplemental figure we observed higher pro levels in both double mutants and overexpression lines than in the wild type plants . moreover overexpression lines contained more pro than double mutants . in conclusion _PROTEIN_ overexpression increases drought tolerance by elevating stress responsive genes such as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ negatively regulates drought stress tolerance by mediating _PROTEIN_ ubiquitination . the stable _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein accumulation and drought tolerance experiments provide indirect evidence that _PROTEIN_ plays a redundant role of _PROTEIN_ in regulating the function of _PROTEIN_ .
