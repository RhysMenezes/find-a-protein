to gain insights into the molecular details of photosystem i biogenesis we characterized the psbp domain _PROTEIN_ mutant of arabidopsis thaliana that specifically lacks psi activity . deletion of _PROTEIN_ results in an inability of the mutant to grow photoautotrophically and a specific loss of the stable psi complex . unaltered transcription and translation of _LOCATION_ encoded psi genes indicate that _PROTEIN_ acts at the posttranslational level . in vivo protein labeling experiments reveal that the rate of synthesis of psi reaction center proteins _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ is comparable to that of wild type plants whereas the rate of turnover of _PROTEIN_ proteins is higher in _PROTEIN_ than in wild type plants . with increasing leaf age _PROTEIN_ content _PROTEIN_ considerably while psi content remains constant . _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ encoded _LOCATION_ lumenal protein and is associated with psi but is not an integral subunit of psi . biochemical and molecular analyses reveal that _PROTEIN_ interacts directly and specifically with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . yeast two hybrid experiments show that _PROTEIN_ interacts with some lumenal loops of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . our results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is a psi assembly _PROTEIN_ that assists the proper folding and integration of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ into the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ .
the psbp is a well characterized psii subunit that is required for optimal oxygen evolving activity in arabidopsis . plants contain a family of psbp related proteins termed psbp like _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins . in arabidopsis there are two _PROTEIN_ genes and seven _PROTEIN_ genes . it has been reported that the _PROTEIN_ protein is involved in psii repair process under high light conditions and that the _PROTEIN_ protein contributes to ndh complex accumulation and function suggesting that psbp related proteins may be involved in other photosynthetic processes . recently it has been suggested that the _PROTEIN_ protein is involved in strigolactone biosynthesis . however the functions of the remaining six _PROTEIN_ proteins are largely unknown . thus we initiated a project to systematically characterize the functions of the other six _PROTEIN_ proteins . here the function of the _PROTEIN_ protein is characterized . the t dna insertion line of _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ obtained from the arabidopsis biological source center _PROTEIN_ was identified . when grown in soil homozygous _PROTEIN_ seedlings were lethal . cultivation on suc containing medium rescued mutant seedlings . however they were still pale yellowish and growth retarded compared with wild type plants and were not able to flower . to gain insight into the primary target of _PROTEIN_ mutation noninvasive fluorometric analyses were conducted . the ratio of variable _METHOD_ to maximal _METHOD_ which is an indicator of the maximum efficiency of psii photochemistry was reduced in _PROTEIN_ . photochemical quenching nonphotochemical quenching and the actual psii efficiency were and respectively in wild type plants . however qp npq and could not be measured in _PROTEIN_ which is a behavior typical for mutants blocked in photosynthetic electron transport downstream of psii . to further investigate whether and how psi is affected in _PROTEIN_ the light induced redox kinetics of psi were examined . the mutant did not show any detectable absorbance changes of at nm indicating that psi was not functional in _PROTEIN_ . in addition _METHOD_ emission spectra were also characterized in _PROTEIN_ . the maximum _METHOD_ emission band peaking at nm in the wild type characteristic for a functional psi was shifted to nm in _PROTEIN_ . as no psi core complex was detectable but _PROTEIN_ proteins were still detectable in _PROTEIN_ this blue shift in _PROTEIN_ could be attributable to the free uncoupled light harvesting complex i proteins . similar observations have been shown in several psi deficient arabidopsis mutants . to verify the observed phenotype in the _PROTEIN_ mutant is specific for the knockout of _PROTEIN_ a second line with a t dna insertion in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was obtained from the arabidopsis thaliana t dna mutagenized population . the _PROTEIN_ line behaved like the _PROTEIN_ line with respect to growth and spectroscopic characterization . to confirm that the _PROTEIN_ gene disruption was responsible for the mutant phenotype complementation for the _PROTEIN_ line was performed with _GENE_ genomic dna . the complemented plant showed normal wild type behavior . thus it can be concluded that disruption of the _PROTEIN_ gene is responsible for the observed _PROTEIN_ phenotypes . because of the nonfunctional psi photosynthetic electron transport is blocked thus psii becomes the major target of excessive light . to test this possibility the wild type and the mutant were grown under either higher or lower light conditions and then the changes in fv/fm and the amount of subunits of psii were investigated . our data show that under higher light conditions there was a greater _PROTEIN_ in fv/fm and the amount of subunits of psii in the mutant but no significant changes were observed in fv/fm and the amount of subunits of psii in wild type plants suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ in fv/fm in the mutant may be caused by photoinhibition . taken together these data suggest that electron transport through psi in _PROTEIN_ was primarily affected . we then investigated the impaired psi function in _PROTEIN_ at the molecular level . thus _LOCATION_ proteins were analyzed immunobiochemically using a set of antibodies against diagnostic subunits of four multiprotein complexes in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . none of the psi subunits _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pasc psad and _PROTEIN_ were detectable and only traces if any of psi subunits psae _PROTEIN_ and psah could be detected in _PROTEIN_ . this was independent of the light intensity in which the seedlings were grown . however considerable psi antenna proteins were still present in _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were slightly reduced in _PROTEIN_ compared with those in the wild type . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the mutant _PROTEIN_ to and of those in the wild type respectively . the psii subunits psbo and light harvesting complex ii were largely unchanged in the mutant compared with the wild type whereas there was a considerable _PROTEIN_ in the amount of other psii subunits . the diagnostic subunits of cyt complex and _PROTEIN_ synthase _PROTEIN_ in the mutant accumulated to similar levels compared with the wild type . to investigate the possible changes in structure of _LOCATION_ proteins chlorophyll protein complexes were solubilized from _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ using dodecyl d maltopyranoside and separated by blue native _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . figure shows that after the first dimensional separation in the presence of _METHOD_ blue dye six major bands were resolved representing psii supercomplexes monomeric psi and dimeric psii monomeric psii minus psii trimeric lhcii and monomeric lhcii according to our previous study . the bn _PROTEIN_ analysis demonstrates that the amount of psii and psi per unit of chlorophyll was significantly lower in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ isolated from _PROTEIN_ than that from the wild type . analyses of the two dimensional _PROTEIN_ urea _PROTEIN_ gels after _METHOD_ blue staining _METHOD_ that psi core proteins were not detectable in _PROTEIN_ and the relative amounts of the psii core subunits and were considerably reduced in _PROTEIN_ while no significant changes were observed in the amounts of cyt and _PROTEIN_ synthase . lack of psi in _PROTEIN_ is accompanied by alterations in chloroplast ultrastructure . only few stroma lamellae could be observed in _PROTEIN_ . moreover the grana stacks located in parallel bundles in the wild type appeared to be less organized in _PROTEIN_ probably due to the lack of connecting stroma lamellae . there are alternative possibilities for the lack of psi accumulation in _PROTEIN_ . for example _PROTEIN_ may be involved in the transcription of psi genes accumulation of stable psi mrnas and/or translation of psi subunits . since _PROTEIN_ is localized to _LOCATION_ only the psi genes in the _LOCATION_ genome are relevant to any possible function of _PROTEIN_ prior to psi assembly _PROTEIN_ . the _LOCATION_ genome of higher plants encodes three essential subunits of psi _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . as _LOCATION_ encoded assembly _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is essential for psi accumulation we also included the _PROTEIN_ gene in the analysis of the _PROTEIN_ of _LOCATION_ psi genes in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . we first examined psi transcript patterns and accumulation in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ . the levels of transcripts of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were unchanged in _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ acts neither at the transcriptional level nor at the level of mrna maturation or stability . to investigate the possible involvement of _PROTEIN_ in the translation of psi mrnas the association of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with ribosome in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ was compared by polysome loading experiments . total leaf lysates were fractionated and rna purified from the gradient fractions was analyzed with probes specific for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts . no significant differences in the association with polysomes between the wild type and _PROTEIN_ were observed for the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes suggesting that psi mrna translation proceeds at comparable efficiency and that _PROTEIN_ is not a translation _PROTEIN_ for _LOCATION_ genome encoded psi mrnas . to further investigate whether the lack of psi accumulation in _PROTEIN_ is associated with either impaired protein synthesis or accelerated degradation of psi component proteins the synthesis of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins was examined by in vivo pulse labeling experiments . to this end the leaf proteins were pulse labeled with met in the presence of cycloheximide which inhibits the synthesis of the _LOCATION_ encoded proteins . our results show that the rate of synthesis of psi reaction center _PROTEIN_ proteins remained largely unchanged in _PROTEIN_ . in addition the rates of synthesis of the psii subunits the and proteins and the and subunits of the chloroplast _PROTEIN_ synthase _PROTEIN_ remained almost unchanged in _PROTEIN_ . this indicates that accelerated degradation rather than a block in protein synthesis is responsible for the lack of psi accumulation in ppd . the impairment in stability and/or assembly of psi complex may result in the accelerated degradation of psi complex which leads to the absence of psi reaction center polypeptides in _PROTEIN_ . to investigate this possibility pulse labeling for min was followed by a chase with unlabeled cold met in the presence of cycloheximide to monitor the turnover rates of _LOCATION_ encoded proteins . our results show that the turnover rate of _PROTEIN_ proteins was higher in _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type . also the turnover rates of psii subunits and were higher in _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type . these results suggest that the absence of psi reaction center polypeptides in _PROTEIN_ is due to the impairment in stability and/or assembly of psi complex . recently the relationship between psi assembly _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and psi accumulation during tobacco leaf ontogenesis was investigated and it was found that the amount of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ strongly while psi contents remain constant with increasing leaf age . it is thus suggested that _PROTEIN_ is not required for psi stability but acts an assembly _PROTEIN_ for psi . therefore we also investigated the relationship between _PROTEIN_ and psi accumulation during leaf ontogenesis to examine whether _PROTEIN_ is involved in stability or assembly of psi . we compared the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ with that of the psi reaction center subunits _PROTEIN_ in a series of leaves harvested from d old wild type plants . in these plants leaf number represents the oldest leaves and leaf number represents the youngest leaves . there were no significant differences in chlorophyll contents between these young and old leaves indicating that leaf chlorophyll did not begin to degrade and that senescence did not start yet in these leaves . figure shows that the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ remained largely unchanged with increasing leaf age . however the _PROTEIN_ protein exhibited an age dependent _PROTEIN_ in protein accumulation . the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ was highest in very young leaves and continuously _PROTEIN_ with leaf age . since psi levels remain unchanged with leaf age this in turn suggests a high stability of the psi complex . thus our results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is not required for psi stability and that _PROTEIN_ may act as an assembly _PROTEIN_ for psi . to determine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion was introduced into arabidopsis protoplasts by transient transformation . the analyses of the subcellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins by confocal laser scanning microscopy reveal that _PROTEIN_ is localized to the chloroplast . to further determine the localization of _PROTEIN_ in the chloroplast polyclonal antiserum was raised against _PROTEIN_ protein . a kd protein was detected in total leaf proteins in wild type plants but no signal was detected in total leaf proteins prepared from the mutant . the immunoblot analyses of soluble and _LOCATION_ fractions from percoll purified chloroplasts demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of isolated chloroplasts . protease digestion assays of intact _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ show that _PROTEIN_ was protected from trypsin treatment as is the oxygen evolving lumenal psbo protein of psii . however after sonication of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and psbo both were sensitive to trypsin digestion . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ lumenal protein which is in agreement with the results of previous proteomic studies . to assess whether _PROTEIN_ is a peripheral or intrinsic _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein sonicated _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were incubated with chaotropic salts or alkaline known to release the peripheral proteins from _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . a considerable amount of _PROTEIN_ was released from _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ by treatment with m nacl or m and effectively removed by m or m naoh indicating that _PROTEIN_ is peripherally associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to further investigate whether _PROTEIN_ is localized in grana and/or lamellae _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ the fractions of grana _LOCATION_ and stroma lamellae were isolated from _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ by differential ultracentrifugation . our results show that _PROTEIN_ was detected _PROTEIN_ in the stroma lamellae enriched fraction . taken together our results reveal that _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ lumenal protein but peripherally and _PROTEIN_ associated with stroma exposed _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to test whether _PROTEIN_ is part of a multiprotein complex or an integral subunit of psi isolated _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were solubilized by dm and separated by suc gradient sedimentation . fractions of the gradient were subjected to immunoblot analysis . we observed that the psi complex was completely missing in _PROTEIN_ but psi antenna proteins were detected as monomers at the top of the suc gradient indicating that _PROTEIN_ has little effect on the _PROTEIN_ of the outer antenna but specifically fails to assemble mature psi core complexes . probing of gradient fractions with anti _PROTEIN_ antiserum reveals the presence of two distinct protein complexes . while the bulk of the _PROTEIN_ protein was present in a complex peaking at kd a considerable fraction was associated with much larger complexes peaking at kd . detection of _PROTEIN_ in gradient fractions corresponding to much higher _METHOD_ than free _PROTEIN_ indicate that _PROTEIN_ may not act alone but _METHOD_ to be part of a larger assembly complex for psi . moreover these larger complexes were found in fractions that contained the psi reaction center _PROTEIN_ . in addition _PROTEIN_ was also found in the psi preparations . these results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is associated with psi . we further explored whether _PROTEIN_ is a subunit of psi . to this purpose the content of _PROTEIN_ was compared between the wild type and psi deficiency mutant _PROTEIN_ . our results show that the content of the _PROTEIN_ protein in _PROTEIN_ was comparable to that in the wild type suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is independent of the accumulation of psi complexes and not an integral part of psi complexes . taken together our results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is partially associated with psi complexes but not a subunit of the psi complex . the above results show that _PROTEIN_ is required for the accumulation of psi and is associated with the psi complex . it is thus expected that it may interact with some subunits of the psi complex . to test this possibility coimmunoprecipitation assays were performed on dm solubilized _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . figures and show that the psi complex could be precipitated by anti _PROTEIN_ antiserum . by contrast the proteins cyt f and _PROTEIN_ were not precipitated under such conditions . in addition pull down assays provided further support for such interactions between _PROTEIN_ and the psi complex . additional evidence came from the results obtained by immunoblotting with anti _PROTEIN_ and anti _PROTEIN_ antisera of bn/sds _PROTEIN_ gels showing colocalization of _PROTEIN_ with the psi core complex both in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant . overlay assays were performed further to explore which subunits of psi complexes interact with _PROTEIN_ . the chlorophyll protein complexes were separated by bn _PROTEIN_ followed by fractionations and then resolved proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose _LOCATION_ . the _LOCATION_ were first incubated with purified his _PROTEIN_ fusion protein and the possible proteins binding to _PROTEIN_ were subsequently detected by immunoblotting with the his tag specific antibody . figure shows that one spot was detected to comigrate with the distinct signal of the _PROTEIN_ proteins in the psi complex as identified by probe of a duplicate _LOCATION_ with anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies . as a negative control probing the nitrocellulose _LOCATION_ without addition of his _PROTEIN_ with anti his tag antibody did not yield any signal . this suggests that _PROTEIN_ interacts with only _PROTEIN_ proteins of psi complexes . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ alone or both bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation analyses were performed . our results reveal that _PROTEIN_ interacts directly with both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but not with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ and that psbp does not interact with _PROTEIN_ . far protein gel blot assays also demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ interacts with both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . thus our results clearly show that _PROTEIN_ interacts directly and specifically with both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . since our results show that _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ lumenal protein we further examined which lumenal domains of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are responsible for the direct interactions with _PROTEIN_ by yeast two hybrid assay . the lumenal loops of _PROTEIN_ were designated as to respectively . similarly the lumenal loops of _PROTEIN_ were designated as _PROTEIN_ to respectively . our results show that _PROTEIN_ interacted with three loops of _PROTEIN_ corresponding to and but not with and . _PROTEIN_ also interacted with three loops of _PROTEIN_ corresponding to loop _PROTEIN_ and but not with _PROTEIN_ and . these data demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ interacts specifically with distinct lumenal loops of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . since plant _PROTEIN_ is a transmembrane protein with a large n terminal lumenal domain containing an additional amino acid residue extension but not found in cyanobacteria and because this domain is close to the lumenal loops of _PROTEIN_ we further investigated whether there is an interaction between _PROTEIN_ and the lumenal domain of _PROTEIN_ by yeast two hybrid assay . our results show that there was no interaction between _PROTEIN_ and the lumenal domain of _PROTEIN_ .

for pulse labeling primary leaves from d old young seedlings were preincubated in cycloheximide for min prior to radiolabeling with ci met in the presence of cycloheximide for min at . pulse labeling of the leaves was followed by a chase in the presence of mm cold unlabeled met . after labeling the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were isolated and the proteins were subjected to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ before autoradiography . total rna was extracted from fresh leaf tissues using trizol reagent and separated on a agarose formaldehyde gel blotted to positively charged nylon _LOCATION_ and hybridized with labeled cdna probes prepared according to our previous study . polysomes were isolated from leaf tissues according to citation . rna in each fraction was isolated separated and transferred onto nylon _LOCATION_ which were probed following high stringency hybridization and washing the blots were exposed to x ray film for to d. for the production of polyclonal antibodies against _PROTEIN_ the
