background chloroplasts are plant cell organelles of cyanobacterial origin . they perform essential metabolic and biosynthetic functions of global significance including photosynthesis and amino acid biosynthesis . most of the proteins that constitute the functional chloroplast are encoded in the _LOCATION_ genome and imported into the chloroplast after translation in the _LOCATION_ . since protein targeting is difficult to predict many _LOCATION_ encoded _LOCATION_ proteins are still to be discovered . results by tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ we identified different proteins from purified arabidopsis chloroplasts . most proteins could be assigned to known protein complexes and metabolic pathways but more than of the proteins have unknown functions and many are not predicted to localize to the chloroplast . novel structure and function prediction methods provided more informative annotations for proteins of unknown functions . while near complete protein coverage was accomplished for key chloroplast pathways such as _PROTEIN_ fixation and photosynthesis fewer proteins were identified from pathways that are downregulated in the light . parallel rna profiling revealed a pathway dependent correlation between transcript and relative protein abundance suggesting gene regulation at different levels . conclusions the chloroplast proteome contains many proteins that are of unknown function and not predicted to localize to the chloroplast . _PROTEIN_ of _LOCATION_ encoded chloroplast genes is regulated at multiple levels in a pathway dependent context . the combined shotgun proteomics and rna profiling approach is of high potential value to predict metabolic pathway prevalence and to define regulatory levels of gene _PROTEIN_ on a pathway scale .
we used purified chloroplasts for two different protein fractionation strategies based on multidimensional chromatography of proteins and peptides and enrichment of envelope _LOCATION_ proteins because envelope and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins can not be separated by mdc . altogether proteins were identified with high confidence . the mdc approach allowed the exclusive identification of proteins and proteins were exclusively identified from the envelope fraction while proteins were identified by both fractionation procedures . we have compiled all relevant information on the identified proteins into a database that is available at http //www.pb.ipw.biol.ethz.ch/proteomics/ . we determined to which extent targetp citation predicted the chloroplast localization of the identified proteins . since most of the proteins from the outer envelope _LOCATION_ do not contain a transit peptide we separately analyzed the targetp prediction of _LOCATION_ encoded proteins for the proteins identified by the two fractionation strategies excluding all putative contaminants . targetp predicted a chloroplast localization of only of the envelope proteins while proteins were predicted to localize to mitochondria to the secretory pathway and to any other location citation . in contrast targetp correctly predicted the chloroplast localization of of the proteins identified by the mdc approach . only proteins were predicted to localize to mitochondria to the secretory pathway and to any other location . considering targetp specificity and sensitivity citation it is likely that the prediction for different subcellular localizations results from incorrect negative predictions of true chloroplast proteins . we can not exclude however that these proteins are targeted to more than one organelle . dual targeting has been described for several proteins and there is currently no evidence that the published list is exhaustive . in this context it is interesting to note that proteins with homology to components of the mitochondrial protein import machinery _PROTEIN_ have been identified from chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ citation . although we can not completely rule out that some incorrect negative predictions of true chloroplast proteins are due to misannotated n termini these findings suggest that organellar protein import and protein trafficking are more complex than previously anticipated . it is also possible that some of the proteins not predicted by targetp to localize to the chloroplast were from other cell organelles and not removed during chloroplast isolation and purification . most of these proteins are ribosomal proteins and were found in the preparation of outer envelope proteins . the envelope _LOCATION_ is in close contact with other cell organelles and the _LOCATION_ and the interaction of the identified _LOCATION_ proteins with the surface of the chloroplast envelope might be of biological relevance . additional experiments and functional analyses are now required to substantiate the envelope association of the identified proteins and the biological relevance of potential interactions . for the subsequent analyses we therefore focused our efforts on the proteins identified from the mdc approach . recent proteome analyses with arabidopsis mitochondria and _LOCATION_ identified the most abundant proteins of these organelles which provided a reference to assess the level of potential cross contamination citation . based on these studies we predict that two proteins in our mdc proteome analysis are more likely to be of peroxisomal origin and five are more likely to be of mitochondrial origin . this indicates that a potential crosscontamination with proteins from these organelles is approximately or less . we performed rna profiling analyses by using the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ genechip to determine if a correlation exists between the chloroplast proteins identified by _METHOD_ and their _PROTEIN_ levels . the analysis of rna samples from leaves of the same developmental stage revealed that approximately of the identified proteins were also highly _PROTEIN_ at the rna level citation . considering the specialized function of the chloroplast and the dynamic range of the proteins in the chloroplast proteome this correlation between rna levels and shotgun _METHOD_ protein identification provides a useful estimate of protein abundance citation . based on this correlation we compared the distribution of targetp predicted chloroplast proteins and nonpredicted proteins among the five categories of rna _PROTEIN_ levels shown in citation . as expected we found a significantly higher proportion of proteins with a chloroplast signal peptide in the two categories of highest rna _PROTEIN_ levels . proteins without a canonical transit peptide were also found in the categories of lower rna _PROTEIN_ levels . since contaminations typically result from abundant proteins that are also _PROTEIN_ highly at the rna level it is therefore unlikely that our identification of chloroplast proteins without a canonical transit peptide resulted from a systematic contamination of the chloroplast protein fractions with abundant proteins from other cell compartments . it is broadly accepted that during evolution genes were transferred from the cyanobacterial endosymbiont to the _LOCATION_ of the eukaryotic progenitor cells . our proteomics data should indicate how many of these genes may encode proteins that are now transported into the chloroplast without a canonical transit peptide . we therefore searched the cyanobacterial and saccharomyces cerevisiae genomes for the identified chloroplast proteins that lack a _LOCATION_ targeting signal _LOCATION_ to identify those proteins that have a homolog in cyanobacteria but not in yeast citation . the blast homology searches of cyanobacterial and yeast genomes by using both conservative and more permissive thresholds show a significantly larger fraction of these nonpredicted proteins to have a homolog in cyanobacteria but not in yeast than is typical of arabidopsis proteins as a whole . this result strongly suggests that the identified proteins are of cyanobacterial origin and imported into chloroplasts without a canonical transit peptide . we assigned the identified proteins to known chloroplast metabolic and regulatory pathways based on established functional categories . most of the proteins with known function were found in the categories metabolism and energy which include proteins with functions in amino acid metabolism _PROTEIN_ metabolism and photosynthesis . this reflects the _PROTEIN_ function of the chloroplast in cellular energy metabolism and is consistent with known chloroplast metabolic activities . we next classified the proteins that were identified from the mdc approach and were not predicted to localize to the chloroplast by their enzymatic function citation . as expected the functional profiles of predicted and nonpredicted chloroplast proteins were similar . the majority of the proteins not predicted to localize to the chloroplast were of unknown function citation . these data also allowed us to establish the chloroplast localization of an essential step in purine biosynthesis . we identified phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase which is predicted to localize to mitochondria in the chloroplast proteome . phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase is one of three enzymes that catalyze the conversion of glycinamide ribonucleotide to aminoimidazole ribotide . the two other enzymes are predicted to localize to the chloroplast which strongly argues that these steps in purine biosynthesis occur in _LOCATION_ . moreover phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase was also consistently found in by _LOCATION_ . the significant number of proteins with unknown function makes it difficult to assign novel metabolic activities to the chloroplast . we therefore applied structure and function prediction methods to develop more informative annotations for proteins of unclassified function citation . of the proteins in this set annotated as _PROTEIN_ hypothetical or unknown we were able to predict a molecular function and/or structure for at least one domain for by using the bioinformatics approaches described in the supplemental experimental procedures . we illustrate these predictions for four representative sequences _GENE_ _GENE_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ . analysis of _GENE_ suggested a potential n terminal transmembrane domain followed by two copies of a calcium binding domain _PROTEIN_ . _GENE_ has two different domains with related functions a galectin _PROTEIN_ recognition domain near the n terminus and a c terminal domain from the galactosyltransferase family . the third example _GENE_ has four copies of the rna binding domain . analysis of _GENE_ which was identified in the _LOCATION_ fraction revealed seven putative transmembrane helices . the automatically derived mips classification predicted this protein to be an amino acid transporter which we could confirm by our analysis . we identified proteins with predicted functions in transport processes including the putative amino acid transporter _GENE_ . most of these proteins were identified in the envelope fraction which would be consistent with their functions in the outer and inner envelope _LOCATION_ . of all identified proteins were predicted in silico to localize to the inner envelope _LOCATION_ citation and nine of these proteins have putative transport functions . our proteome analysis confirmed the chloroplast envelope localization of these proteins and provides further support for the nine predicted transporter proteins in the chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ . in addition the chloroplast envelope localization of five of the nine predicted transporter proteins was recently reported citation . we also identified components of the chloroplast protein import complex _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ except for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . this could indicate that these two proteins are present at substoichiometric levels compared to the other _PROTEIN_ and toc proteins or are perhaps not constitutive components of the import machinery . the identified proteins represent a cross section of the full chloroplast proteome . since _METHOD_ identification was biased toward abundant proteins citation our results most likely reflect the identification of biochemical pathways in the chloroplast that are most active at the developmental stage and growth condition of the plants used in our experiments . therefore we predicted that our proteomics approach could identify most if not all enzymes of active pathways . less active or inactive pathways would result in a comparatively lower coverage of identified proteins . we tested our hypothesis by analyzing the proteins we identified for important _LOCATION_ metabolic activities . coverage of chloroplast functions was e.g. for calvin cycle enzymes and for _LOCATION_ encoded photosynthetic electron transport proteins citation . the identified proteins included all enzymes of the calvin cycle except for a ribose epimerase which is also _PROTEIN_ at very low rna levels citation . this enzyme catalyzes the conversion of xylulose phosphate to ribulose phosphate which is important for the regeneration of ribulose phosphate as the primary substrate for _PROTEIN_ fixation . the failure to detect ribose epimerase in our mdc approach suggests that ribulose phosphate may be predominantly regenerated from sedoheptulose bisphosphate by the concerted action of transketolase and ribose phosphate isomerase both of which were identified under our experimental conditions citation . coverage of enzymes from amino acid synthesis pathways was less complete . since glutamate and glutamine synthesis occur in the light while synthesis of aromatic amino acids is downregulated in the light citation we investigated pathway coverage for these metabolic pathways in more detail citation . all enzymes from the glutamate and glutamine synthesis pathways were identified suggesting that they are most active during photosynthesis citation . several enzymes from the branched chain amino acid and arginine synthetic pathways were identified but pathway coverage was less complete . no enzyme was identified for the synthesis of aromatic amino acids . aromatic amino acids are precursors for a large variety of secondary metabolites many of which are involved in stress responses . their synthesis is induced during stress and is usually not detectable under normal growth conditions citation . pathway prevalence as suggested by pathway coverage is also well reflected at the rna _PROTEIN_ levels which are highest for enzymes in the glutamate glutamine and branched chain amino acid synthesis pathways and lowest for the aromatic amino acid synthesis pathways . for a general assessment of the correlation between transcript and relative protein abundance we calculated the spearman rank correlation for important chloroplast metabolic functions . collectively we found a positive correlation between transcript abundance and protein detection for the amino acid synthesis pathways and the calvin cycle citation resulting in a spearman rank correlation of and respectively . the positive correlation suggests that in photosynthetically active chloroplasts these metabolic pathways are regulated primarily at the transcriptional level . this is in contrast to the tetrapyrrole synthesis pathway for which we could not find a strong correlation between transcript levels and relative protein abundance . only a weak correlation was found for _LOCATION_ encoded proteins of _METHOD_ i and ii . since tetrapyrrole synthesis is tightly coordinated with the synthesis of photosystem light harvesting proteins our results support a view that this coordination is largely controlled by posttranscriptional processes which are not fully understood at present . similarly our proteome analysis identified only of the known proteins involved in the regulation of chloroplast gene _PROTEIN_ citation . together these results may reflect the growth of the plants at a light condition that reduces photodamage induced repair of photosystem ii and the time of harvest which is most likely before the chloroplasts have reached their full photosynthetic potential .
