protein s acylation commonly known as palmitoylation is a reversible posttranslational modification that catalyzes the addition of a saturated lipid group often palmitate to the sulfhydryl group of a cys . palmitoylation regulates enzyme activity protein stability subcellular localization and intracellular sorting . many plant proteins are palmitoylated . however little is known about protein s acyl transferases _PROTEIN_ which catalyze palmitoylation . here we report that the tonoplast localized _PROTEIN_ is critical for development and salt tolerance in arabidopsis thaliana . _PROTEIN_ loss of function resulted in pleiotropic growth defects including smaller leaves dwarfism and sterility . in addition _PROTEIN_ mutants are hypersensitive to salt stresses . we further show that _PROTEIN_ regulates the tonoplast localization of several calcineurin b like proteins _PROTEIN_ including _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ whose _LOCATION_ association also depends on palmitoylation . introducing a mutation within the highly conserved catalytic motif of _PROTEIN_ failed to complement _PROTEIN_ mutants indicating that _PROTEIN_ functions through protein palmitoylation . we propose that _PROTEIN_ mediated palmitoylation is critical for _LOCATION_ function by regulating _LOCATION_ association or the activities of tonoplast proteins .
we used a reverse genetic approach to understand the function of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and identified two t dna insertion lines for _PROTEIN_ . t dna was inserted at the intron or the exon of _PROTEIN_ genomic sequence for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . by pcr analysis we confirmed that the genomic sequences upstream and downstream of the insertion sites were intact in mutants . to find out whether the t dna insertions disrupted _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ we performed rt pcr analysis on rnas isolated from seedlings of the wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutants . rt pcrs with a primer pair that amplified upstream sequences of t dna insertions detected _PROTEIN_ transcript in both the wild type and _PROTEIN_ . however no transcript was detected in _PROTEIN_ mutants when primer pairs flanking the t dna insertion sites were used suggesting that _PROTEIN_ mutants were not able to produce full length _PROTEIN_ . experiments using both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ produced identical results . therefore results reported hereafter were those obtained with _PROTEIN_ unless noted . homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutants displayed pleiotropic developmental defects compared with the wild type under soil growth condition . _PROTEIN_ was substantially smaller and developed more slowly . as a result growth differences became more pronounced over time . rosette leaves of _PROTEIN_ were much smaller than those of the wild type at d after germination although leaf shape was normal . the size reduction was due to reduced cell number as well as reduced cell expansion . in addition _PROTEIN_ showed early senescence on the leaf tips when growing in soil at dag . during floral transition _PROTEIN_ showed no correlation between flowering time and rosette leaf number such that they flowered temporally _PROTEIN_ but had fewer rosette leaves than the wild type likely a consequence of slow development . inflorescence _METHOD_ were much shorter for _PROTEIN_ than for the wild type . mutant flowers were also smaller than those of the wild type . although stamen filaments of _PROTEIN_ were shorter than the wild type pistils of _PROTEIN_ mutants were also shorter allowing reaching of stigma surface by pollen . _PROTEIN_ growing in soil were completely sterile without elongating siliques . although we were able to obtain homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutants from self pollinated heterozygous _PROTEIN_ the ratio of homozygous to heterozygous mutants was much lower than expected . this suggested that the loss of _PROTEIN_ led to gametophytic defects . to find out which gametophyte was defective due to _PROTEIN_ loss of function we performed reciprocal crosses between heterozygous _PROTEIN_ mutants and the wild type . results showed that pollen of _PROTEIN_ did not transmit as well as that of the wild type while female gametophytes were not affected . these results suggested that the defective male gametophytes were caused by _PROTEIN_ loss of function . to find out at which stage male gametophytes of _PROTEIN_ was defective we next analyzed pollen viability using diamidino phenylindole and alexander s stain . no differences were observed _PROTEIN_ pollen viability between the wild type and _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ did not regulate pollen viability . however scanning electron microscopy _PROTEIN_ showed that the deposition of the pollen coat was abnormal in homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutants even though no difference was observed in the pollen coats of heterozygous _PROTEIN_ plants versus in the wild type . because deposition of the pollen coat depends on the sporophytic tapetum we concluded that _PROTEIN_ loss of function also caused sporophytic male defects . transmission electron microscopy further confirmed the pollen coat defect of _PROTEIN_ whereas _PROTEIN_ pollen contained fewer lipid bodies than the wild type . we further analyzed in vitro pollen germination and growth . a low percentage of _PROTEIN_ pollen germinated . pollen germination of heterozygous _PROTEIN_ was also significantly reduced compared with the wild type suggesting that mutations at _PROTEIN_ not only caused sporophytic male defects but also affected gametophytic male function . mutant pollen tubes ceased growth early resulting in short tubes . to find out whether _PROTEIN_ regulated pollen tube growth in vivo we performed aniline blue staining on emasculated wild type pistils hand pollinated with pollen either from the wild type or _PROTEIN_ . at h after pollination when most wild type pollen tubes reached to the bottom of a pistil pollen tubes of _PROTEIN_ just emerged from the style . at hap all ovules in pistils pollinated by the wild type were fertilized and developing . by contrast few ovules were targeted by _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes at hap despite the _PROTEIN_ that the mutant pollen tubes had reached the bottom of the pistils . these results suggested that _PROTEIN_ and directional growth of pollen tubes was compromised by _PROTEIN_ loss of function . our reciprocal analysis using the wild type and heterozygous _PROTEIN_ mutants indicated that female gametophytes were not affected by _PROTEIN_ loss of function . however reciprocal crosses using wild type pollen and _PROTEIN_ pistils failed to produce seeds . to find out whether _PROTEIN_ loss of function caused sporophytic female defects we performed aniline blue staining on _PROTEIN_ pistils pollinated with wild type pollen . at hap when wild type pollen tubes reached to the bottom of wild type pistils they hardly reached to the middle of _PROTEIN_ pistils suggesting that _PROTEIN_ pistils could not support pollen tube growth . _PROTEIN_ analysis of mature ovules did not reveal morphological differences between the wild type and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ovule integuments . we further performed optical sections on unfertilized mature ovules as well as ovules immediately after fertilization . interestingly embryo sacs of _PROTEIN_ were found to be disorganized at the _PROTEIN_ end compared with the ordered organization in the wild type . in contrast with normal embryo development in the wild type after fertilization embryo sacs of _PROTEIN_ gradually degenerated likely due to fertilization failure . no such embryo sac defects were observed in ovules from heterozygous _PROTEIN_ mutants which correlated with the normal transmission of mutant female gametophytes during reciprocal crosses . the pleiotropic developmental defects by _PROTEIN_ loss of function suggested a constitutive _PROTEIN_ pattern . indeed _PROTEIN_ was previously found to be _PROTEIN_ in all tissues via microarray analysis . in addition we analyzed the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ using gus _PROTEIN_ reporter lines by histochemical analysis . gus signals were detected in mature embryos cotyledons and whole seedlings . in mature leaves the gus signal was highest at hydathodes as well as in guard cells . _PROTEIN_ was strongly _PROTEIN_ at the sites of _PROTEIN_ root initiation and at root tips . dissection of gus signals in vascular bundles showed that _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ strongly in phloem but not in xylem . it is intriguing that the gus signal was not detected at most reproductive tissues whereas _PROTEIN_ loss of function resulted in developmental defects . we reasoned that the promoter sequences used to generate gus reporter lines might not contain all of the information required for _PROTEIN_ . therefore we next performed rna in situ hybridization to find out whether _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in reproductive tissues . indeed _PROTEIN_ was strongly _PROTEIN_ in the tapetal layer of developing anthers starting from anther developmental stage . with tapetal degeneration _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gradually increased in developing microspores and in mature pollen . _PROTEIN_ was also _PROTEIN_ at the embryo sacs and surrounding cells in mature pistils . in addition no signal was detected in reproductive organs when identical rna in situ hybridization was performed in _PROTEIN_ indicating that the probe was specific for _PROTEIN_ without cross reacting with the other _PROTEIN_ . to confirm that the pleiotropic developmental defects were caused by _PROTEIN_ loss of function we performed a complementation study in which we introduced a _PROTEIN_ genomic fragment green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ translational fusion _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ into _PROTEIN_ . exogenous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ rescued all defects of the _PROTEIN_ mutants confirming the null mutant identity of _PROTEIN_ . since the _METHOD_ translational fusion did not interfere with the function of _PROTEIN_ we therefore used it to study the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ by _METHOD_ microscopy . unlike the gus reporter lines which showed no signal in most reproductive tissues the _METHOD_ signal was detected in pollen confirming that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in reproductive tissues or cells requires intronic sequences . because animal _PROTEIN_ can have functions independent of their enzymatic activities we wondered whether arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ regulated development through its s acyl transferase activity . therefore we introduced a point mutation at _PROTEIN_ so that the conserved dhhc motif was changed to dhhs _PROTEIN_ as such a mutation was previously shown to abolish _PROTEIN_ activity . the exogenous _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not rescue _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ functions through its palmitate transferase activity . the subcellular localization of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ was recently performed via transient _PROTEIN_ in nicotiana benthamiana leaves . when _PROTEIN_ was transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco epidermal cells this protein mostly colocalized with a _LOCATION_ marker but reached the tonoplast several days _PROTEIN_ . we introduced the wave lines _PROTEIN_ red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ labeled endomembrane markers into the complemented plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ for analysis via confocal _METHOD_ microscopy . _PROTEIN_ did not colocalize with the trans _LOCATION_ network/early endosome marker nor the _LOCATION_ marker or the prevacuolar compartment marker . instead _PROTEIN_ showed significantly colocalization with the tonoplast marker . we also performed an uptake study in the complemented lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ using the endocytic dye . after h of uptake the _METHOD_ signal completely merged with at the tonoplast . addition of brefeldin a a fungal toxin that interferes with vesicle trafficking at the _LOCATION_ and the tgn/ee caused aggregation of positive vesicles but not _PROTEIN_ labeled compartments . since _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not rescue _PROTEIN_ we next wanted to find out if the mutation altered its subcellular localization thus failing to complement . an uptake study was performed in lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . similar to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the majority of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized at the tonoplast together with after h uptake . however in contrast with _PROTEIN_ additional punctate vesicles were detected for _PROTEIN_ . such punctate localization was also detected in pollen tubes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but not in pollen tubes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . upon bfa treatment these _METHOD_ labeled vesicles aggregated to regions surrounding the positive bfa compartments indicating that these vesicles were _LOCATION_ apparatus . the tonoplast localization of _PROTEIN_ prompted us to test the responses of _PROTEIN_ to salt and osmotic stresses because _LOCATION_ are critical organelles for plant responses to these abiotic stresses . we applied various stresses to _PROTEIN_ including high concentrations of nacl licl kcl cscl mannitol and abscisic acid . the _PROTEIN_ mutants were hypersensitive to nacl and licl as _PROTEIN_ grew poorly under high nacl and licl stresses . next we tested the _PROTEIN_ of salt responsive genes such as responsive to dessication _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ early responsive to _LOCATION_ and responsive to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ whose _PROTEIN_ was greatly induced by abiotic stresses . real time quantitative rt pcr analysis showed that salt stresses significantly induced higher _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type . although the absolute increase of _PROTEIN_ was slightly lower in _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type the induction ratio of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ was comparable to that of the wild type . however _PROTEIN_ itself was not induced by salt stresses . the hypersensitivity of _PROTEIN_ to salt stresses gave us a hint about candidate substrates of _PROTEIN_ . arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ play critical roles in abiotic stress responses . tonoplast localization of _PROTEIN_ is regulated by palmitoylation . in addition the cys residues for palmitoylation were conserved among several tonoplast localized _PROTEIN_ such as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ indicating that they are likely modified by palmitoylation . we therefore hypothesized that the tonoplast localized palmitoylated _PROTEIN_ are substrates of _PROTEIN_ . to find out whether the palmitoylation regulated tonoplast localization of _PROTEIN_ relies on _PROTEIN_ we tested the subcellular localization of _METHOD_ fused _PROTEIN_ in wild type or _PROTEIN_ protoplasts . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the wild type protoplasts showed tonoplast localization . however _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ was relocated to the cytoplasm similar to soluble _METHOD_ . because the cys residues proven to be the palmitoylation sites in _PROTEIN_ were also present in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we suspected that their tonoplast localization was also regulated by _PROTEIN_ . indeed both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were localized at the tonoplast in wild type protoplasts but they became _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ protoplasts . treatment with bromopalmitate _PROTEIN_ a specific inhibitor of protein palmitoylation caused relocalization of _PROTEIN_ from the tonoplast to cytoplasm in wild type protoplasts confirming their palmitoylation regulated tonoplast localization . taken together these results suggested that _PROTEIN_ are putative substrates of _PROTEIN_ . to exclude the possibility that loss of _PROTEIN_ tonoplast localization was caused by a general reduction of cellular palmitoylation owing to _PROTEIN_ loss of function we introduced _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ into _PROTEIN_ protoplasts . the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized _PROTEIN_ and the endosome localized _PROTEIN_ both contain sequences for palmitoylation and regulate plant responses to abiotic stresses . the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ was abolished by _PROTEIN_ treatment suggesting that its _LOCATION_ association depended on palmitoylation . however _LOCATION_ association of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was retained in _PROTEIN_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ loss of function did not reduce protein palmitoylation globally . the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ as well as that of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were not affected by _PROTEIN_ loss of function suggesting that the integrity of the endomembrane system was intact .
