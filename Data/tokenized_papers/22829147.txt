seed dormancy controls the start of a plant s life cycle by preventing germination of a viable seed in an unfavorable season . freshly harvested seeds usually show a high level of dormancy which is gradually released during dry storage . abscisic acid has been identified as an essential _PROTEIN_ for the induction of dormancy whereas gibberellins are required for germination . the molecular _METHOD_ controlling seed dormancy are not well understood . delay of _PROTEIN_ was recently identified as a major regulator of dormancy in arabidopsis thaliana . here we show that the _PROTEIN_ protein accumulates during seed maturation and remains stable throughout seed storage and imbibition . the levels of _PROTEIN_ protein in freshly harvested seeds highly correlate with dormancy . the _PROTEIN_ protein becomes modified during after ripening and its levels in stored seeds do not correlate with germination potential . although aba levels in _PROTEIN_ mutants are reduced and ga levels enhanced we show that _PROTEIN_ does not regulate dormancy primarily via changes in hormone levels . we propose that _PROTEIN_ protein abundance in freshly harvested seeds acts as a timer for seed dormancy release which functions largely independent from aba .
seed development consists of an embryogenesis phase followed by a seed maturation phase . seed maturation starts after the embryo has been fully developed and ends when the seed is mature and desiccated which under our growth conditions occurs at d after pollination and dap respectively . citation showed by rna gel blot analysis that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ can first be detected at the beginning of seed maturation peaked around the mid maturation stage and _PROTEIN_ toward the end of seed maturation . we confirmed these results by quantitative rt pcr on siliques and seeds of the highly dormant genotype near isogenic line _PROTEIN_ using primers that amplify all known _PROTEIN_ transcript variants from alternative splicing . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ shows a peak around dap followed by a reduction in _PROTEIN_ until of the peak level in freshly harvested seeds . we could also confirm that _PROTEIN_ transcript levels quickly disappear after seed imbibition . similar to _PROTEIN_ transcript levels its protein gradually increased in abundance after the start of seed maturation and reached a peak during the mid maturation phase . however in contrast with the transcript level _PROTEIN_ protein did not _PROTEIN_ after reaching its peak but remained at the same level suggesting that it is a very stable protein . as a consequence freshly harvested seeds contain low _PROTEIN_ transcript levels but high _PROTEIN_ protein levels . seed dormancy is released by after ripening and we were interested in the dynamics of the _PROTEIN_ protein during this process . the amount of _PROTEIN_ slightly _PROTEIN_ during dry storage of nil _PROTEIN_ seeds but was still relatively high after weeks of after ripening when dormancy had already been fully released . we also monitored the dynamics of transcript and protein levels during imbibition using freshly harvested and after ripened seeds . in contrast with _PROTEIN_ transcript levels which quickly disappear after imbibition _PROTEIN_ protein was hardly affected by imbibition both in dormant and after ripened seeds . these results indicate that germination potential is not correlated with _PROTEIN_ protein abundance in after ripened imbibed seeds . interestingly induction of _PROTEIN_ in imbibed seeds using a transgenic _PROTEIN_ line containing the _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ from the heat shock promoter was also not able to induce dormancy . seeds from this line germinated when _PROTEIN_ was induced by a h treatment after to h of imbibition . natural arabidopsis accessions show considerable differences in seed dormancy which can for an important part be explained by a quantitative trait locus located at the _PROTEIN_ gene both in laboratory and field experiments . in addition it was shown that differences in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ between arabidopsis accessions contribute to geographical variation in dormancy and germination . we confirmed the observation of citation that the strongly dormant nil _PROTEIN_ genotype shows higher _PROTEIN_ transcript levels than the low dormant ler accession . in addition the _PROTEIN_ mutant which was generated in the nil _PROTEIN_ background showed strongly _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transcript levels . consistent with the transcript levels an immunoblot analysis of seed protein showed that the _PROTEIN_ protein level in freshly harvested seeds is more abundant in nil _PROTEIN_ than in ler . _PROTEIN_ protein could not be detected in the _PROTEIN_ mutant which does not produce full length protein because of a one nucleotide deletion and subsequent frameshift halfway through the gene . we further studied the effect of _PROTEIN_ protein levels on seed dormancy using eight independent _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines that each contained a genomic fragment of _PROTEIN_ in a single introgression event . analysis of the _PROTEIN_ protein levels in freshly harvested seeds from these plants showed a high variation varying from line with _PROTEIN_ protein levels similar to ler to lines and in which _PROTEIN_ accumulated to much higher levels than nil _PROTEIN_ . the germination rate during dry seed storage of these lines showed a high correlation with their _PROTEIN_ protein levels . line showed low dormancy levels and germinated close to after weeks of storage but lines and germinated < after weeks of dry storage . in summary we always observed a strong correlation of _PROTEIN_ transcript and protein levels in freshly harvested seeds with seed dormancy levels . this indicates that the level of _PROTEIN_ protein in freshly harvested seeds determines the level of seed dormancy . environmental conditions during seed maturation influence dormancy . we were interested in the role of _PROTEIN_ in the dormancy response to temperature during seed maturation . ler _PROTEIN_ and nil _PROTEIN_ plants were grown until the onset of flowering under a day/night temperature regime of . next half of these plants were transferred to a day/night temperature regime of while the other half remained at . seeds subsequently harvested from ler and nil _PROTEIN_ plants showed increased seed dormancy at the lower seed maturation temperature . analysis of _PROTEIN_ transcript levels in freshly harvested seeds revealed that seeds matured at contained higher _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels compared with seeds that matured at in all three genotypes . in addition immunoblot analysis showed enhanced _PROTEIN_ protein levels under the cooler seed maturation condition . this indicated that reduced temperatures during seed maturation enhance _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ leading to higher _PROTEIN_ protein levels and higher dormancy levels . despite the strong correlation between _PROTEIN_ protein levels and dormancy in freshly harvested seeds such a correlation is completely lacking in after ripened seeds suggesting a loss of _PROTEIN_ activity during after ripening . such a loss of activity could be caused by an altered protein structure . this possibility was investigated by analysis of _PROTEIN_ protein on two dimensional gels . the _PROTEIN_ antibody is not entirely specific and recognizes some additional proteins which hinders the identification of _PROTEIN_ protein on gels . therefore we used transgenic columbia plants containing tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ from the cvi _PROTEIN_ promoter . figure shows that _PROTEIN_ protein of freshly harvested h imbibed seeds is focused at the isoelectric point value of . _PROTEIN_ proteins from imbibed seeds after weeks after ripening were detected at two major spots which were shifted toward the acidic side . this indicates that the _PROTEIN_ protein is altered during the after ripening process probably leading to its loss of function . the shift in isoelectric focusing of _PROTEIN_ protein during after ripening has been repeatedly observed in two independent seed batches . citation showed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is seed specific . to determine the tissue specific distribution of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ within the seed we performed an in situ hybridization analysis using developing seeds during mid maturation at which time _PROTEIN_ shows its peak _PROTEIN_ level . the hybridization signals of the antisense _PROTEIN_ probe in consecutive sections were _PROTEIN_ found in vascular tissues of the cotyledon hypocotyl and radicle of the embryo . similar experiments using the sense probe did not show any signal . we also monitored the activity of _PROTEIN_ driven by the _PROTEIN_ cvi promoter . consistent with the signal from in situ hybridization gus activity was observed in vascular tissues . we conclude that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the vascular tissue of the embryo . to examine the functional relevance of the tissue specific _PROTEIN_ that we observed a complementation analysis was performed in which _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ from the following tissue specific promoters prostm and and prozhoupi and . interestingly _PROTEIN_ was able to confer some level of dormancy with all of these promoters . differences in dormancy level between these misexpression lines could be caused by differences in the amount of produced _PROTEIN_ protein and was not further studied . these results suggested that although _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ from the vascular tissue it can function independent of where it is _PROTEIN_ in the seed . to elucidate the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ protein we constructed transgenic plants containing the _PROTEIN_ genomic fragment with an n terminal yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tag that was driven by the promoter and selected lines that complemented the _PROTEIN_ phenotype . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ detected in the _LOCATION_ . the balance between the aba and ga pathways determines the dormancy level and germination potential of seeds . both dormant and nondormant seeds show a decline in their aba levels within the first h of imbibition . thereafter dormant seeds show consistently higher aba levels than nondormant seeds . we studied the _PROTEIN_ kinetics of aba and ga metabolic genes during imbibition of fresh mature ler _PROTEIN_ and nil _PROTEIN_ seeds in detail . nine cis epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase genes are key regulatory genes of aba biosynthesis and were generally upregulated in nil _PROTEIN_ compared with ler and _PROTEIN_ . the aba catabolic mutants _PROTEIN_ are defective in aba hydroxylase activity and accumulate higher amounts of aba in dry and imbibed seed . among the four genes coding for the enzymes in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ has been shown to be responsible for degradation of aba during early imbibition of seeds . induction of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was not observed in nil _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ had similar _PROTEIN_ patterns in all three genotypes during imbibition . however the _PROTEIN_ levels in ler were lower at the beginning of imbibition while those in _PROTEIN_ were lower at extended imbibition times . overall our data suggest that _PROTEIN_ is not directly involved in the aba pathway but de novo aba synthesis partially contributes to dormancy _PROTEIN_ in nil _PROTEIN_ . we also examined the _PROTEIN_ pattern of several ga biosynthetic genes . the level of _PROTEIN_ transcript was already higher in dry seeds of _PROTEIN_ compared with nil _PROTEIN_ and ler . upon imbibition _PROTEIN_ and and _PROTEIN_ and were all induced in _PROTEIN_ from rather early stages onwards . this induction was not observed in dormant nil _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ negatively influences ga biosynthesis during imbibition . we determined the aba and ga levels in seeds to find out whether the differential _PROTEIN_ of the above mentioned genes alters the actual hormone levels . figure shows that the aba level in fresh mature dry seed was significantly higher in nil _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type . by contrast the _PROTEIN_ mutant showed lower aba levels . we also analyzed h imbibed seeds . as expected aba levels were _PROTEIN_ compared with that of dry seeds in all three genotypes . however they were still higher in nil _PROTEIN_ compared with the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the ga levels in h imbibed seeds showed larger differences between the three genotypes than the aba levels . ga levels were significantly higher in _PROTEIN_ which was in good accordance with the biosynthetic gene _PROTEIN_ pattern . these results indicated that ga production was repressed during imbibition in dormant nil _PROTEIN_ seeds . the nondormant phenotype of _PROTEIN_ mutants is very similar to that of mutants defective in either biosynthesis or signaling of aba . however in contrast with those mutants _PROTEIN_ can not germinate without ga as shown by the absence of germination in a double mutant with . in accordance germination of _PROTEIN_ seeds was sensitive to paclobutrazol an inhibitor for ga biosynthesis although at a reduced level compared with nil _PROTEIN_ . finally _PROTEIN_ has nearly wild type sensitivity to applied aba . these data indicated that the nondormant phenotype of _PROTEIN_ was not caused by severe impairment of aba signaling . however the strong _PROTEIN_ cvi allele is not able to induce dormancy when it is combined with the _PROTEIN_ mutation . to determine whether the nondormant phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutant could be explained by reduced _PROTEIN_ levels we checked _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mutant lines . surprisingly our qrt pcr results showed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is increased in the _PROTEIN_ background _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ allele . an immunoblot analysis showed that in accordance with the transcript levels _PROTEIN_ protein levels were higher in aba deficient genetic backgrounds . these data demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ function requires aba and that a feedback regulation exists between these two inducers of dormancy . seeds of the _PROTEIN_ mutant exhibit strongly increased aba levels and enhanced dormancy . we found that seeds from the double mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ show reduced dormancy compared with the _PROTEIN_ single mutant and germinated around directly after harvest as reported by citation . analysis of the aba levels in these mutants indicated strongly increased aba levels in _PROTEIN_ compared with its wild type background col which was also shown by citation . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant had aba levels comparable to the _PROTEIN_ single mutant . this indicated that high aba accumulation can not compensate for the absence of _PROTEIN_ function . therefore _PROTEIN_ and aba are both necessary for the induction of seed dormancy .
