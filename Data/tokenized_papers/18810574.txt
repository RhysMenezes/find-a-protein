plant _LOCATION_ stacks are mobile organelles that can travel along actin filaments . how _PROTEIN_ vesicles are transferred from _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ export sites to the moving _LOCATION_ stacks is not understood . we have examined _PROTEIN_ vesicle transfer in high pressure frozen/freeze substituted plant cells by electron tomography . formation of each _PROTEIN_ vesicle is accompanied by the assembly of a ribosome excluding scaffold layer that extends approximately nm beyond the _PROTEIN_ coat . these _PROTEIN_ scaffolds can attach to the cis side of the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ vesicles are then transferred to the _LOCATION_ together with their scaffolds . when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion protein of an arabidopsis thaliana homolog of the _PROTEIN_ vesicle tethering _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ localized to the _PROTEIN_ scaffold and to the cis side of the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . time lapse imaging of _LOCATION_ stacks in live root meristem cells demonstrated that the _LOCATION_ stacks alternate between phases of fast linear saltatory movements and slower wiggling motions . in root meristem cells approximately of the _LOCATION_ stacks were connected to an _LOCATION_ export site via a _PROTEIN_ scaffold and these stacks possessed threefold more _PROTEIN_ vesicles than the _LOCATION_ not associated with the _LOCATION_ in columella cells only of _LOCATION_ stacks were located in the vicinity of the _LOCATION_ . we postulate that the _PROTEIN_ scaffold first binds to and then fuses with the cis side of the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ transferring its enclosed _PROTEIN_ vesicle to the cis _LOCATION_ .
figure illustrates a tomographic slice image of a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ network complex and an _LOCATION_ cisterna in an a. thaliana root meristem cell . the surrounding cytoplasm is crowded with _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ bound ribosomes which delineate the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ as a ribosome free zone that completely encompasses the _LOCATION_ and tgn cisternae . the tomographic reconstruction of the _LOCATION_ tgn and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as well as of the ribosome excluding zone illustrated in fig . is based on tracings of the _LOCATION_ and of the interface region of the ribosome free zone in each of the nm _PROTEIN_ tomographic slices of this sample . the surface of the ribosome free zone possesses invaginations that contain ribosomes but these ribosomes do not make contact with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . identification of the cisterna types was according to the structural criteria defined by staehelin et al . . the model of the reconstructed _LOCATION_ stack and tgn cisternae displays a small cis most cisterna at the top a characteristic set of stacked cis medial and trans _LOCATION_ cisternae in the middle and three tgn cisternae on the bottom . figure provides three dimensional views of the tomographically reconstructed _LOCATION_ stack in fig . b in the context of the adjacent _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the presence of budding vesicles on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ closest to the cis side of the _LOCATION_ stacks indicates that this _LOCATION_ region corresponds to an _LOCATION_ export site . the morphological identification of the four _PROTEIN_ buds and six _PROTEIN_ vesicles was based on the six structural criteria defined in donohoe et al . . in addition to _PROTEIN_ vesicles _PROTEIN_ type vesicles were seen around the _LOCATION_ stack in fig . . among the _PROTEIN_ vesicles five vesicles displayed morphological features of the _PROTEIN_ type vesicles and they are located either in the vicinity of the cis _LOCATION_ cisternae or at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ interface . the other _PROTEIN_ vesicles conformed to the structural criteria of the _PROTEIN_ type vesicle and are located at the immediate outside of the edges of medial and trans _LOCATION_ cisternae and around the tgn cisterna attached to the trans side of the _LOCATION_ stack . the complex architecture of a meristem cell _LOCATION_ export site is seen most clearly in fig . in which the _LOCATION_ cisternae are displayed as _PROTEIN_ structures that do not obscure the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . although the _PROTEIN_ buds are clustered they are not being produced by one coherent _LOCATION_ domain . instead these _PROTEIN_ buds are forming on three different tubular _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ domains and are facing in different directions . this complex geometry together with the _PROTEIN_ that _LOCATION_ export sites in these cells contain only one to four budding _PROTEIN_ vesicles helps explain why it has been so difficult to identify _LOCATION_ export sites in high pressure frozen meristem cells and to display more than one _PROTEIN_ bud profile in a single thin section or tomographic slice image . in contrast to previous reports we have not observed any tubular _LOCATION_ connections between _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ cisternae in any of our high pressure frozen samples . in our root meristem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ the majority of the _LOCATION_ stacks were seen adjacent to _LOCATION_ cisternae exhibiting _PROTEIN_ type budding vesicle profiles and approximately of these budding profiles were located within nm of the nearest _LOCATION_ . interestingly all _LOCATION_ stacks in close apposition to _LOCATION_ export sites were oriented with their cis side facing the budding _PROTEIN_ vesicles . figure depicts the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ model shown in fig . together with the associated _LOCATION_ ribosome excluding _PROTEIN_ . in our _METHOD_ the ribosomes were identified as small black structures with a diameter of approximately nm that could be seen in six to seven sequential tomographic slices . the ribosome excluding _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ is seen to encompass all of the _LOCATION_ and tgn cisternae all of the _PROTEIN_ vesicles as well as two of the three budding _PROTEIN_ vesicles . the budding _PROTEIN_ vesicle marked by the yellow arrowhead in fig . is also surrounded by a ribosome excluding zone but this particular ribosome free zone is separate from the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . the model shown in fig . also depicts all of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ type vesicles associated with this _LOCATION_ stack and all but one of these vesicles are clearly contained within the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ region in the model . note that as previously reported by donohoe et al . the _PROTEIN_ type vesicles co localize with the _PROTEIN_ vesicles between the budding _PROTEIN_ vesicles and the cis _LOCATION_ cisternae whereas the _PROTEIN_ type vesicles are confined to the regions around the medial and trans _LOCATION_ cisternae and the first tgn cisterna . the ribosome excluding layer of a forming _PROTEIN_ vesicle is shown in greater detail in fig . c. a tomographic model of the ribosome free layer was generated to fit inside the ribosomes that came closest to the _PROTEIN_ vesicle surface . the average _PROTEIN_ of this ribosome free layer was determined by plotting the ribosome density at varying distances from the three budding _PROTEIN_ vesicle surfaces . at distances of < nm the ribosome density is typically less than but increases nearly fourfold at a distance of nm . thus we conclude that the ribosome excluding layer is approximately nm _PROTEIN_ and that this _PROTEIN_ is significantly larger than the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ coat . for comparison we show the ribosome density distribution adjacent to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ where the ribosome free zone is only approximately nm wide . the ribosome free layer of budding _PROTEIN_ vesicles can become continuous with the cis side of a _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and the two connected ribosome excluding _METHOD_ appear to be an extension of the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ that includes the budding _PROTEIN_ vesicle attached to the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . in fig . i a _PROTEIN_ vesicle located similarly close to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as the one shown in fig . f is also seen to be encompassed by a ribosome excluding layer but the vesicle has been severed from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ indicating that the layer persists after vesicle release . figure l illustrates a _PROTEIN_ vesicle that lies close to the edge of a small cis most _LOCATION_ cisterna . the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ around this vesicle is also approximately nm _PROTEIN_ and shows a bulge reminiscent of a _PROTEIN_ ribosome excluding layer that has partly fused with the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ during the course of delivery of the enclosed _PROTEIN_ vesicle to the cis _LOCATION_ region of the stack . the similarities between the postulated functions of vesicle tethering molecules and the ribosome free layer of _PROTEIN_ vesicles described in this paper suggest that the two structures might be related . two peripheral _LOCATION_ proteins with long coiled coil domains namely saccharomyces cerevisiae and mammalian have been shown to be recruited to _PROTEIN_ vesicle producing _LOCATION_ sites and to link _PROTEIN_ vesicles to _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . these proteins have also been postulated to form a scaffold like structure around the _LOCATION_ to which they are bound . recently latijnhouwers et al . reported the amino acid sequence and domain structure of an a. thaliana protein that is related to both and and localized the protein to tobacco _LOCATION_ stacks . although the protein was named _PROTEIN_ in the report we call the protein _PROTEIN_ here based on its homology with mammalian . the size and domain structure of _PROTEIN_ are more similar to those of than to those of . we cloned the cdna of _PROTEIN_ from an a. thaliana seedling rna extract and generated tobacco cell lines and a. thaliana transgenic plants that _PROTEIN_ an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein . we verified the _PROTEIN_ of the full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein in our transgenic by cell lines and a. thaliana plants by immunoblot analysis . the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is lower in a. thaliana plants than in tobacco by cells . ultrastructural analyses of the transformed cells demonstrated that the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein neither altered the overall architecture of the _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ stacks nor changed the geometry organization and/or number of _PROTEIN_ vesicles . immunogold labeling of thin sections of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cells localized the protein to _PROTEIN_ vesicle surfaces to the space between the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and cis _LOCATION_ cisternae and to the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ region of cis _LOCATION_ cisternae . these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is contained in the ribosome free layer of _PROTEIN_ vesicles . we termed this outer layer of the _PROTEIN_ vesicle coat the _PROTEIN_ scaffold based on the localization of the scaffold protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to the structure . in by cells the _LOCATION_ stacks carry out stop and go movements alternating between fast linear translocation and slower wiggling motions . _LOCATION_ stacks have been reported to be associated with _LOCATION_ export sites more frequently during the wiggling phases than during the fast linear movement phases . to characterize the dynamic behavior of _LOCATION_ stacks in root meristem cells we have taken time lapse movies of _LOCATION_ stacks in transgenic a. thaliana plants _PROTEIN_ a mannosidase i _METHOD_ fusion protein _METHOD_ . although the _PROTEIN_ of mani _METHOD_ in these plants is driven by a promoter with duplicated enhancer elements the mani _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ levels vary greatly among different cell and tissue types . in the root meristem region cells in which _LOCATION_ stacks are _METHOD_ labeled by mani _METHOD_ are only seen sporadically but frequently enough to allow for the systematic analysis of _LOCATION_ movements in meristem cells . to delineate the boundaries of individual cells the mani _METHOD_ a. thaliana seedling roots were briefly stained with before time lapse imaging . our video recordings indicate that the _LOCATION_ stacks in meristem cells also alternate between fast linear saltatory type movements and slower wiggling motions as seen previously in by cells . the d speed of the saltatory _LOCATION_ stacks was and that of wiggling _LOCATION_ stacks . was . of the meristem cell _LOCATION_ stacks that we recorded only ten displayed significant linear saltatory type movements . incubation of the roots in latrunculin b stopped the saltatory movements indicating that the fast linear movements are dependent on the actin _LOCATION_ . the central prediction of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ secretory unit model is that nearly of _LOCATION_ stacks are stably associated with _LOCATION_ export sites . to investigate the nature of the _PROTEIN_ scaffold linkage in root meristem cells we have determined the percentage of _LOCATION_ stacks that are connected to _LOCATION_ export sites by the _PROTEIN_ scaffold . since the architecture of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ can not always be clearly defined in micrographs of nm thin sections of high pressure frozen root meristem cells we utilized electron tomography to determine the arrangement of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and budding _PROTEIN_ vesicles in relation to _LOCATION_ stacks . as mentioned above of the _LOCATION_ stacks fully contained in our root meristem cell _METHOD_ ten appeared to be associated with an _LOCATION_ export site as evidenced by the presence of _PROTEIN_ scaffold linkages to the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . the remaining four _LOCATION_ stacks lacked the _PROTEIN_ scaffold connections to the _LOCATION_ and were located at distances of more than nm from the closest _LOCATION_ cisterna _LOCATION_ . the functional uncoupling of the latter _LOCATION_ from an _LOCATION_ export site is supported by the _PROTEIN_ that on average the free _LOCATION_ stacks had fewer _PROTEIN_ vesicles _PROTEIN_ near their cis cisternae than _LOCATION_ stacks associated with an _LOCATION_ export site _PROTEIN_ . in gravity sensing columella root tip cells all of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ are confined to the cell cortex where they form a compact _LOCATION_ network that excludes not only the amyloplast statoliths but also _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ stacks . due to this unique cellular architecture _LOCATION_ stacks located in the central cytoplasm typically several micrometers away from the closest _LOCATION_ can easily be distinguished in thin section electron micrographs from those that are close enough to the cortical _LOCATION_ to permit interaction with _LOCATION_ export sites . thus these cells provide an excellent model system for quantifying the number of _LOCATION_ associated versus _LOCATION_ free _LOCATION_ stacks without resorting to very time consuming electron tomography analyses . of the _LOCATION_ stacks analyzed in this manner only seven were located within possible reach of the _PROTEIN_ < nm from the cortical _LOCATION_ . further analysis demonstrated that some of these latter _LOCATION_ stacks were indeed associated with _LOCATION_ export sites identified by budding _PROTEIN_ vesicles . the tomographic data illustrated in fig . f demonstrate that the _LOCATION_ stacks of columella cells interact with _LOCATION_ export sites in the same way as those in meristem cells . first the _LOCATION_ stack always interacts via the cis side of its _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ with the _LOCATION_ export site . second the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ is always seen to be physically continuous with the _PROTEIN_ scaffold of at least one budding _PROTEIN_ vesicle . this appears to be the anchor that holds the _LOCATION_ stack to the site . third an _LOCATION_ export site is typically marked by the presence of multiple budding _PROTEIN_ vesicle profiles _PROTEIN_ and one to several _PROTEIN_ vesicles . in contrast to the _LOCATION_ seen interacting with the cortical _LOCATION_ export sites the free _LOCATION_ stacks in the cell interior are randomly oriented and show no association with any organelle . the cell interior type _LOCATION_ stack depicted in fig . did not have any _PROTEIN_ vesicles in the vicinity of its cis cisternae .
