the dcl gene of tomato is required for chloroplast development palisade cell morphogenesis and embryogenesis . previous work suggested that dcl protein is involved in rrna processing . the arabidopsis thaliana heynh . genome contains five sequences encoding for dcl related proteins . in this paper we investigate the function of atdcl protein which shows the highest amino acid sequence similarity with tomato dcl . atdcl mrna was _PROTEIN_ in all tissues examined and a fusion between atdcl and green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ was sufficient to target _METHOD_ to _LOCATION_ in vivo consistent with the localization of atdcl to chloroplasts . in an effort to clarify the function of atdcl transgenic plants with altered _PROTEIN_ of this gene were constructed . deregulation of atdcl gene _PROTEIN_ caused multiple phenotypes such as chlorosis sterile flowers and abnormal cotyledon development suggesting that this gene is required in different organs . the processing of the rrna was significantly altered in these transgenic plants indicating that atdcl is involved in _LOCATION_ rrna maturation . these results suggest that atdcl is the arabidopsis ortholog of tomato dcl and indicate that _LOCATION_ function is required for normal plant development .
sequence comparison of tomato dcl with proteins in current databases revealed significant similarity to five sequences from the arabidopsis genome sequencing project . these sequences showed no significant homology to any protein sequence in the database other than dcl except for a dcl related gene which is much larger than tomato dcl _PROTEIN_ and encodes a protein related to rna polymerase subunit . one of these dcl related sequences exhibited the highest amino acid sequence similarity with tomato dcl and was designated atdcl . it shows similarity and identity over the entire open reading frame . the highest sequence identity was seen at the c terminus which contains the dcl domain found in all dcl related proteins . analysis of these arabidopsis dcl related proteins using common targeting prediction _METHOD_ suggested that only atdcl is localized in the chloroplast . we suggest therefore that atdcl is the arabidopsis ortholog of dcl . to begin the study of the function of atdcl _PROTEIN_ analysis of the atdcl gene was undertaken . a screen of the est database identified two _PROTEIN_ sequence tags . neither of these cdna sequences is complete and so and _PROTEIN_ experiments were performed using total rna from leaves . the sequence of the full length cdna of atdcl was then determined . using atdcl cdna as probe the _PROTEIN_ pattern of atdcl was examined by northern blot experiments . the atdcl gene was _PROTEIN_ in all organs examined including leaves _METHOD_ flowers and siliques . this is consistent with the _PROTEIN_ pattern of tomato dcl which is also _PROTEIN_ in all types of tissues and stages of development examined . a kb transcript was detected in the four organs examined consistent with the size determined by sequencing the full length cdna of atdcl . however a second transcript of kb was detected in flowers and siliques . since atdcl genes are quite different from each other at the level of dna sequence we assume that this kb transcript in flowers and siliques corresponds to differentially spliced transcript or resulted from an alternative transcript termination . to confirm that atdcl is targeted to _LOCATION_ in vivo an in frame fusion between the coding regions of atdcl and the gene for _METHOD_ was made and used for stable transformation of arabidopsis . the _PROTEIN_ of atdcl _METHOD_ fusion in protoplasts isolated from a stably transformed arabidopsis plant was examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy . the results of these experiments clearly show that the fusion protein co localized with the chloroplast chlorophyll . without the putative transit peptide _METHOD_ signals were dispersed in the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ . thus atdcl is able to target proteins to _LOCATION_ in vivo confirming that atdcl is a _LOCATION_ localized protein . to explore the function of the atdcl gene phenotypic and molecular analyses of transgenic arabidopsis lines overexpressing the atdcl _METHOD_ fusion were performed . for this the atdcl _METHOD_ fusion was cloned downstream of the camv promoter . this promoter was chosen because it is known to be constitutively _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis an _PROTEIN_ pattern that matches that of the atdcl gene . this construct was transformed into arabidopsis wild type plants . in total transformants were obtained after selection on murashige and skoog medium containing hygromycin . when transferred to soil transformants showed similar developmental defects and were further analyzed . the transformants were pale green had chlorotic and poorly fertile flowers and their growth was extremely retarded compared to the wild type . the results presented here are all derived from studies of one of these transgenic lines named atdcl _METHOD_ . segregation analysis of the generation indicated that a single t dna was inserted into the atdcl _METHOD_ line . northern blot analysis revealed that this line accumulated a very high level of atdcl _METHOD_ transcript and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ indicated that the atdcl _METHOD_ fusion protein accumulated to high levels and was correctly localized in the _LOCATION_ . therefore these results suggest that the developmental defects observed in transgenic lines resulted from an overexpression of atdcl _METHOD_ fusion protein . when germinated in vitro the progeny of the atdcl _METHOD_ line contained seedlings with abnormal cotyledon development . this phenotype is consistent with the role of tomato dcl during embryogenesis . to test whether atdcl protein is involved in rrna processing we examined the _PROTEIN_ of the small rrna in the transgenic plants . as expected the _PROTEIN_ pattern of rrna was severely affected in the atdcl _METHOD_ mutant . in contrast rrna accumulated normally . together these data suggest that overexpression of atdcl _METHOD_ affects rrna formation which in turn affects normal _LOCATION_ function and plant development . therefore we suggest that overexpression of atdcl _METHOD_ behaves as a dominant negative mutation and indicates that atdcl might play the same function as tomato dcl . to further analyze atdcl function we generated transgenic arabidopsis plants that constitutively _PROTEIN_ antisense atdcl transcript . when selected on murashige and skoog medium containing hygromycin true transformants with healthy roots segregated into normal green and albino seedlings . the latter grew slowly and died before true leaves were formed which suggests that _PROTEIN_ of antisense atdcl is lethal . the survivor transformants were transferred to soil . from independent transgenic lines became chlorotic after weeks and were further analyzed . they gave rise to few seeds and their progeny segregated into normal and chlorotic seedlings characterized by variation in cotyledon number . five week old siblings of the progeny of one of the transformants are shown in fig . and . mutant plants grew extremely slowly had chlorotic flower buds and died after weeks . in contrast the normal progeny showed developmental defects at a more advanced stage yellow inflorescence initiation of many axillary _METHOD_ at the same place shoot apical meristem arrested stem fasciation and fasciated siliques . we assume that these plants still _PROTEIN_ the atdcl gene albeit at reduced levels while it is completely off in the mutant progeny exhibiting chlorosis at an early stage . together these data show that overexpression of antisense atdcl causes chlorosis throughout the vegetative cycle of the plant and affects normal plant development . rna gel blot analysis was used to investigate the effect of overexpression of antisense atdcl on the steady state level of rrna . leaf tissue was collected for total rna extraction from wild type and antisense atdcl mutant plants . figure shows that rrna accumulation was dramatically reduced in antisense atdcl mutant plants in comparison with the wild type which is consistent with previous data from overexpression of the atdcl _METHOD_ fusion . we then tested the effect of the overexpression of antisense atdcl on the accumulation of _LOCATION_ proteins . total leaf protein was extracted from mutant plants of two independent lines and protein gel blot analysis was performed using antibodies raised against _LOCATION_ proteins . while _PROTEIN_ protein accumulated to near normal level a strong reduction was observed in the abundance of _PROTEIN_ psi d and lhcii proteins . this is consistent with the effect of dcl m mutation on the accumulation of _LOCATION_ proteins in tomato . together these results demonstrate that overexpression of antisense atdcl affects rrna processing and strongly suggest that atdcl protein is involved in _LOCATION_ rrna maturation .
