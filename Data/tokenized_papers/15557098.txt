meiosis is often described as a special case of cell division since it differs from mitosis in having two _LOCATION_ divisions without an intervening s phase . it will be of great interest to uncover what molecular _METHOD_ underlie these special features of meiosis . we previously reported that the tardy asynchronous meiosis mutant of arabidopsis is slower in cell cycle progression in male meiosis . here we report that _PROTEIN_ encodes the a type cyclin _PROTEIN_ . the point mutation in tam replaced a conserved threonine with an isoleucine in the linker region between the and helices of the first cyclin fold . by studying the dynamics of a _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein fusion protein under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter we found that the fusion protein was most abundant at pachytene but was undetectable from _PROTEIN_ prophase i until telophase ii . nonetheless cell cycle progression in tam was delayed in both pachytene and meiosis ii . we conclude either that the _PROTEIN_ produced in prophase i indirectly regulates meiosis ii progression or that a very low level of _PROTEIN_ directly regulates meiosis ii progression . either of these scenarios is a deviation from the typical mode of action of mitotic cyclins in mitosis and meiosis i in which each _LOCATION_ division is coupled with a peak of _PROTEIN_ of mitotic cyclins .
to learn the molecular identity of _PROTEIN_ we mapped tam to a bacterial artificial chromosome clone corresponding to a region of approximately kb on the bottom arm of chromosome . two promising candidates in this region a gene predicted to encode a protein kinase _PROTEIN_ and a gene predicted to encode an a type cyclin _PROTEIN_ were chosen for complementation of tam . a wild type genomic fragment including the coding region and the upstream and downstream regions of each of the genes was introduced into tam via agrobacterium mediated transformation . a total of eight independent transformations were performed for each of the transgenes . because the kinase gene failed to complement tam in transformants and its cdna sequence from wild type and tam were identical we concluded that _PROTEIN_ is not the kinase . however every transformant with the fragment containing the cyclin gene produced only tetrads in male meiosis at either or . this phenotype was in sharp contrast to that in tam plants where there is typically a good portion of _PROTEIN_ at and nearly _PROTEIN_ at . we obtained the cdna for _PROTEIN_ from both the wild type and tam rna samples by reverse transcription pcr using primers outside the predicted coding region . comparison of the wild type cdna with that from tam revealed a nucleotide change from c to t in exon resulting in a thr to ile replacement at amino acid . these results indicate that the meiotic defect in tam results from the mutation in _PROTEIN_ . analysis of the wild type genomic and cdna sequences indicated that _PROTEIN_ has exons and encodes a protein of amino acids as correctly predicted by gene modeling in the arabidopsis database . _PROTEIN_ has the two typical cyclin folds at the c terminus that account for approximately of the protein . thr where the substitution in tam occurs is presumably the first amino acid in the linker region between the and helices of the first fold . this thr is conserved in a b d and e type cyclins . the linker region is predicted to be essential for forming the correct angle between the and helices . the substitution of a hydrophobic ile for a hydrophilic thr presumably results in incorrect folding of the and helices which likely leads to a loss of function of _PROTEIN_ . this interpretation is consistent with the recessive nature and temperature sensitivity of the tam mutation . based on this analysis we predicted that tam plants might exhibit a less severe meiotic defect if grown at a temperature lower than the customarily used for arabidopsis growth . indeed when we transferred mature tam plants from to and examined the meiotic products d _PROTEIN_ tam plants produced only tetrads further supporting that the ile to thr replacement causes a temperature sensitive phenotype . in addition to the meiotic phenotype we consistently observed that tam plants were delayed in bolting by approximately week suggesting that _PROTEIN_ might be _PROTEIN_ in cells other than microsporocytes . to test this prediction we performed rt pcr using _PROTEIN_ specific primers and total rna samples from different tissues . the transcript could be detected after pcr cycles but hardly at all after pcr cycles in roots rosette leaves _METHOD_ and inflorescences . from the results of this and eight other rt pcr experiments the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ appeared low in all tissues tested . to confirm this we compared its level in the inflorescence with that of the _PROTEIN_ transcript . _PROTEIN_ has a conserved role in recombination in eukaryotes . _PROTEIN_ can be _PROTEIN_ as a gene with a low or moderate _PROTEIN_ level in total rna isolated from the inflorescence because it is _PROTEIN_ predominantly in meiocytes in early meiosis . our rt pcr experiments indicated that while the _PROTEIN_ transcript could be detected simultaneously with an actin control in the same reaction tube the _PROTEIN_ pcr fragment whose length was similar to that of the _PROTEIN_ pcr fragment was undetectable when the actin control was in the same reaction tube . this result demonstrates that the level of _PROTEIN_ transcript is lower than that of the _PROTEIN_ transcript . microarray analysis of cyclin gene transcription indicated that the peak level of the _PROTEIN_ transcript was much lower than the peak levels of most of the other cyclins . interestingly the microarray data also indicated that the highest level of the _PROTEIN_ transcript was in the anther as compared with the levels in the other tested tissues including leaf root stem inflorescence stage flowers and silique . the overall low level of the _PROTEIN_ transcript perhaps reflects that the gene is _PROTEIN_ only in certain type of cells and/or in a particular period of the cell cycle . to further investigate the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ in male meiosis we generated a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion construct under the control of the same promoter region used for the tam complementation and introduced the gene construct into both wild type and tam plants . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene complemented the tam phenotype suggesting that the subcellular localization and stability dynamics of the fusion protein likely mimicked that of endogenous _PROTEIN_ . the _METHOD_ signal was observed in microsporocytes dissected from some but not all young anthers . this observation suggested that _PROTEIN_ might be present in the microsporocytes only at particular stages . determining the precise stages of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in microsporocytes is critical for understanding its function . however it was difficult to observe distinct chromosome morphology after diamidino phenylindole staining of fresh microsporocytes and conversely fixed microsporocytes had _METHOD_ in the _METHOD_ channel that was further intensified after dapi staining . these limitations hindered observation of the _METHOD_ signal and meiotic stage in the same microsporocytes . therefore we developed a method to indirectly assess the meiotic stage of each sample examined for the _METHOD_ signal . we determined the meiotic stage in a medial anther by examining a portion of the microsporocytes from the same anther or from another medial anther of the same bud . this method is based on the observations that the four medial anthers of arabidopsis are essentially simultaneous in development and that microsporocytes in an anther of _METHOD_ are closely synchronous in cell division . these observations have long been the basis for routine determination of meiotic stages in arabidopsis male meiosis . however as a precautionary measure and as required for determination of the durations of several cell cycle stages we investigated whether the medial anthers within the same buds were highly synchronous in wild type and tam plants at both and . we examined paraformaldehyde fixed and dapi stained medial anthers at various cell cycle stages . both the morphology of microsporocytes and the percentage of binucleate tapetal cells were used to determine the cell cycle stages . we found that the medial anthers within a bud were indeed highly synchronous in cell cycle progression in wild type and tam plants at both and . two or more cell cycle stages in one bud were only observed during the transitions between consecutive stages or around homolog separation presumably reflecting the transient nature of these processes . to detect the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal we recorded the status of the _METHOD_ signal in fresh microsporocytes within min after dissection then almost simultaneously fixed a portion of microsporocytes from the same anther or from another medial anther in the same bud to determine the meiotic stage . the meiotic stage was determined after dapi staining of chromosomes of the dissected microsporocytes or for precise identification of zygotene and pachytene by spreading the chromosomes before dapi staining . the incidence of binucleate tapetal cells which form when microsporocytes are in prophase i also helped in determining the meiotic stage . bleaching of the _METHOD_ signal occurs upon prolonged uv illumination thus for a valid semiquantitative comparison all _METHOD_ images were taken with a s exposure without prior uv illumination and all images were subjected to the same extent of digital adjustment of contrast . no _METHOD_ signal was detected in microsporocytes before zygotene a weak signal appeared at zygotene and the strongest signal was seen in pachytene . _METHOD_ was not detectable from _PROTEIN_ diplotene to anaphase ii . the _METHOD_ signal reappeared in microsporocytes at telophase ii presumably indicating that _PROTEIN_ plays a role in processes occurring after the second _LOCATION_ division . this timing of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was verified in and generation transgenic plants derived from different plants . these results that _PROTEIN_ is predominantly _PROTEIN_ in pachytene and is essentially not _PROTEIN_ again until telophase ii raised the possibility that a one time _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in prophase i was sufficient for normal progression of both meiosis i and meiosis ii . a type cyclins have been found to exist in both the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ and the function of cyclin a in drosophila mitosis is independent of its subcellular localization . sections p and q in figure indicate that the _METHOD_ signal appeared to be in both the cytoplasm and the _LOCATION_ in the tetrad with a slightly higher level in the nucleolus . the subcellular localization pattern of the signal in the zygotene pachytene microsporocytes appeared consistent with that in the tetrad but it was difficult to clearly visualize the _LOCATION_ in the microsporocytes because the microsporocytes were tightly associated . to further detect the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in pachytene microsporocytes which contained the highest level of signal we looked for and recorded the _METHOD_ signal in separate but intact microsporocytes after dissection of the anther . our data confirmed that the signal was in both the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ in pachytene microsporocytes . although we previously inferred that male meiosis in tam was slowed we had not determined precisely which meiotic stages were affected or how much slowing occurred at each stage . to accurately determine when cell cycle slowing occurs in tam we used two different methods to assess the durations of different cell cycle stages in tam relative to those in wild type . first we assumed that the duration of a stage would be positively correlated with the frequency of its occurrence i.e . in randomly sampled buds stages that last longer will be found more frequently while those that are shorter will be found infrequently . this assumption requires that no cell cycle arrest occurs at any stage of male meiosis in tam which was previously established . we investigated the relative frequencies of four consecutive stages of meiosis leptotene zygotene pachytene and early diplotene to early cytokinesis . early cytokinesis is early tetrad stage in wild type but corresponds to early _PROTEIN_ stage in tam . the frequency at leptotene was set to . the results indicated that meiocytes in pachytene were found more frequently in tam than in wild type suggesting that pachytene in tam is longer than that in wild type . this conclusion is consistent with the finding that _PROTEIN_ was predominantly _PROTEIN_ in pachytene in prophase i . we next determined the durations of several phases of the meiotic cell cycle in wild type and tam using a technically _PROTEIN_ method . this method is also based on the synchrony of cell cycle progression in microsporocytes in medial anthers of the same bud . we carefully removed one medial anther at one time point and determined its meiotic stage by fixation and dapi staining and similarly determined the meiotic stage in another medial anther in the same bud at a _PROTEIN_ time point . the difference between the two time points thus defined the time needed to proceed from the early stage to the _PROTEIN_ stage . the extent of chromosome synapsis in the anthers was determined by spreading the chromosomes to distinguish _PROTEIN_ zygotene pachytene or early diplotene . to practice the technique for minimizing damage of the second anther during the removal of the first anther and to obtain preliminary estimates of timing experiments on hundreds of buds were performed . the first and second anthers were chosen from the opposite sides of the bud to minimize the chances of damage to the second anther . because tam plants flower about week _PROTEIN_ than wild type plants and have a more severe phenotype at our formal analysis of the duration of each stage was carried out on to week old wild type plants and on to week old tam plants each _PROTEIN_ at . our data indicate that the duration of zygotene in both genotypes was essentially the same whereas pachytene in tam was approximately h significantly longer than in wild type . notably the durations from zygotene to early cytokinesis in wild type and in tam were approximately the same suggesting that the timing of cytokinesis was not affected in tam . the longer pachytene and the normal timing of cytokinesis apparently accounted for the initial formation of _PROTEIN_ in tam . furthermore these _PROTEIN_ did not become tetrads quickly . the duration of the second _LOCATION_ division in tam i.e . the time required for early _PROTEIN_ to become early tetrads was approximately h . in wild type approximately h were needed for transit from diplotene to early tetrad stage . we also estimated that the duration from diplotene to early prophase ii in wild type was approximately h thereby limiting the duration of the second _LOCATION_ division in wild type to about h. thus the second _LOCATION_ division in tam was approximately h longer than that in wild type . these data indicate that progression through both pachytene and meiosis ii in tam is slowed .
arabidopsis wild type and tam plants were grown in artificial soil in a percival growth chamber under a h h dark regime at or as specified in the text . _PROTEIN_ inflorescences of to week old wild type plants and to week old tam plants were used for determining the durations of meiotic stages . plants of similar or older ages were used in the other experiments . the mapping procedure was as described . the location of tam was narrowed down to a region delineated by cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence marker _PROTEIN_ and rflp marker _PROTEIN_ on chromosome . agrobacterium tumefaciens strain and vector were used for genetic transformation using the floral dip method . total rna from various tissues were prepared using the rneasy plant mini kit . the pcr and rt pcr conditions were essentially as previously described except that longer extension times were used for amplification of longer pcr products . primers for the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ analysis were and ttacgagataaagcaggttttggt . primers for amplification of full length _PROTEIN_ cdna were aaccctaaatctcaccggaaaac and tgcctgacccgactgatgaatt . other internal primers were also used for sequencing the cdna . primers for the genomic fragment used for tam complementation were _PROTEIN_ and tgcatgcatgcatggttggact . primers for the genomic fragment for the _METHOD_ fusion were _PROTEIN_ and acaatatgtacaatacacgagggt . primers to amplify the _METHOD_ fragment from the cambia vector were _PROTEIN_ and tcacacgtggtggtggtggtg . rt pcr was performed using the superscript one step rt pcr kit . appropriate restriction enzyme sites were added to the primers for cloning the products . long fragments were amplified with pfuturbo dna polymerase . an inflorescence on a plant was held with one hand while observing it under a dissecting microscope . one or two sepals of a meiotic stage floral bud were gently peeled back to expose the anthers using a dissecting tool . care was taken to avoid injuring the other anthers although this was not an issue for the one being removed for observation of developmental stage . an exposed medial anther was carefully removed from the bud using the needle . this anther was fixed immediately in paraformaldehyde and dissected as described . the plant being operated on was then returned to the growth chamber until it was time to remove the second medial anther . the second medial anther was selected from the side of the gynoecium opposite to that of the first anther . chromosome spreads dapi staining and the microscope and digital camera settings used were as described . a fitc hyg filter cube was used for _METHOD_ microscopy for detection of the _METHOD_ signal . all digital images were processed using software spot version and adobe photoshop . upon request all novel materials described in this publication will be made available in a timely manner for noncommercial research purposes subject to the requisite permission from any third party owners of all or parts of the material . obtaining any permissions will be the responsibility of the requestor .
