maturation of chloroplast ribosomal rnas comprises several endoribonucleolytic and exoribonucleolytic processing steps . however little is known about the specific enzymes involved and the cleavage steps they catalyze . here we report the functional characterization of the single arabidopsis gene encoding a putative ybey endoribonuclease . atybey null mutants are seedling lethal indicating that atybey function is essential for plant growth . knockdown plants display slow growth and show pale green leaves . physiological and ultrastructural analyses of atybey mutants revealed impaired photosynthesis and defective chloroplast development . _METHOD_ microcopy analysis showed that when fused with the green _METHOD_ protein atybey is localized in chloroplasts . immunoblot and rna gel blot assays revealed that the levels of chloroplast encoded subunits of photosynthetic complexes are reduced in atybey mutants but the corresponding transcripts accumulate normally . in addition atybey mutants display defective maturation of both the and ends of and rrnas as well as _PROTEIN_ accumulation of mature transcripts from the transfer rna genes contained in the chloroplast rrna operon . consequently mutant plants show a severe deficiency in ribosome biogenesis which in turn results in impaired _LOCATION_ translational activity . furthermore biochemical assays show that recombinant atybey is able to cleave chloroplast rrnas as well as messenger rnas and transfer rnas in vitro . taken together our findings indicate that atybey is a chloroplast localized endoribonuclease that is required for chloroplast rrna processing and thus for normal growth and development .
to investigate the role of putative ybey homologs in higher plants we searched for homologs of the e. coli ybey protein in sequenced plant genomes including photosynthetic eukaryotes and cyanobacteria . domain analysis revealed that all putative plant ybeys contain a domain that is similar to bacterial ybey . the majority of plant ybey proteins have an additional haloacid dehalogenase hydrolase like domain while cyanobacterial ybey proteins did not contain this domain . the conserved motif thought to confer a metal ion dependent hydrolytic function is present in most plant ybeys with both domain and had hydrolase like domain . phylogenetic analysis showed that these ybeys can be classified into bacteria lower plant or algae dicot and monocot groups . in arabidopsis there is only one homolog of the bacterial ybey which subsequently will be referred to as atybey . atybey contains both and had hydrolase like domains . reverse transcription pcr analysis showed that the atybey gene is _PROTEIN_ in all tissues examined but at a very low level in _METHOD_ . additionally the level of atybey transcripts was significantly increased when etiolated seedlings were transferred from the dark to the light . bacterial ybey was induced by heat shock . the levels of atybey transcripts were not significantly altered upon growth at or for and h while high temperature increased its transcript abundance at min and _PROTEIN_ subsequently . to determine the subcellular localization of the atybey protein we constructed a gene fusion of atybey with the gene for the _METHOD_ and transformed the chimeric gene into arabidopsis wild type plants . protoplasts were isolated from transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ atybey _METHOD_ and analyzed by _METHOD_ microscopy . the green _METHOD_ of the reporter proteins overlapped completely with the red _METHOD_ of the chlorophyll strongly suggesting that atybey is localized in chloroplasts . chloroplast localized arabidopsis _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ was used here as a positive control . this result is consistent with a recently published proteomic study that detected ybey peptides in the soluble proteome of the chloroplast . taken together our data indicate that ybey is a conserved protein in plants and localized in _LOCATION_ . to study the function of atybey we identified two independent mutant alleles for the atybey locus atybey and atybey from the collection of transfer dna insertion lines of the arabidopsis biological resource center . the t dna insertions in atybey and atybey are in intron and exon respectively of the atybey gene . quantitative reverse transcription pcr analysis indicated that _PROTEIN_ of atybey in atybey was extremely low and was undetectable in atybey . additionally we produced atybey complemented lines in the atybey background and transgenic plants in which _PROTEIN_ of atybey was down regulated by an artificial microrna approach . when compared with the wild type atybey and atybey amirna lines exhibited pale green cotyledons and true leaves and grew slower under greenhouse conditions . consistent with the pale green color of the leaves the total chlorophyll content and the levels of both chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b were significantly reduced in atybey and atybey amirna seedlings and mature plants compared with wild type plants . the ratio of chlorophyll a/b was _PROTEIN_ in atybey and atybey amirna plants tentatively suggesting that the _LOCATION_ photosystem cores are more severely affected than the _LOCATION_ antennae . the mutant phenotype and the pigment deficiency of atybey were fully rescued in the atybey complemented lines . consistent with atybey likely representing a null allele the atybey mutant displayed a much more severe phenotype than the atybey mutant . homozygous atybey plants are unable to complete their life cycle when grown under our standard greenhouse conditions while its heterozygous plants displayed no phenotype . on the contrary atybey complementation lines in atybey background had no defective phenotype and grew normally . in addition heterozygous atybey mutants produced approximately white seeds in young siliques . however abnormal or aborted seeds were not observed after seed maturation . the severe phenotype of the homozygous atybey null mutant suggests that the chloroplast localized atybey protein is very important for plant viability under photoautotrophic growth conditions . to obtain insights into the physiological role of atybey in photosynthesis we determined the psii capacity of atybey mutants . chlorophyll _METHOD_ induction experiments showed that the maximum quantum efficiency of psii and the electron transport rate _PROTEIN_ were significantly lower in atybey than in the wild type . nonphotochemical quenching was higher in atybey than in the wild type . to confirm the defect in chloroplast development suggested by the pale green leaves of atybey mutant plants cotyledons and true leaves of wild type plants and atybey mutant plants were observed by light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy . toluidine blue staining of transverse leaf sections showed that fewer chloroplasts are present in cotyledons of the atybey mutant compared with the wild type . tem analysis further revealed that while chloroplasts in cotyledons and true leaves of wild type seedlings contained a well formed _LOCATION_ system of stroma _LOCATION_ and grana _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ formation was severely altered in the mutant . no stroma _LOCATION_ and relatively more grana _LOCATION_ were observed in chloroplasts of atybey cotyledons and grana _LOCATION_ overaccumulated in true leaves of atybey plants . as expected the defect in _LOCATION_ formation was fully rescued in the complemented line . together these results clearly indicate that atybey is required for proper chloroplast development and _LOCATION_ formation in arabidopsis . the pale green phenotype and defective chloroplast development in atybey prompted us to examine photosynthetic pigment containing complexes by blue native _PROTEIN_ . compared with the wild type the accumulation of psii supercomplexes and psi monomers/psii dimers was strongly reduced in atybey while the accumulation of trimeric light harvesting complex ii was moderately increased . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ analysis of extracted total plant protein showed that the abundance of _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ encoded large subunit of rubisco is drastically _PROTEIN_ in atybey and atybey amirna lines to less than of the wild type level . to determine the consequences of reduced atybey _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ of the _LOCATION_ genome we used immunoblotting to analyze the levels of representative _LOCATION_ encoded protein components of _LOCATION_ protein complexes . in atybey the levels of and two reaction center proteins of psii were reduced to less than of the wild type levels in line with the results of our chlorophyll _METHOD_ measurements . a core subunit of the cytochrome complex and _PROTEIN_ an essential subunit of the _PROTEIN_ synthase were also significantly _PROTEIN_ in the atybey mutant . overall the reduction in photosynthetic complex accumulation is in good agreement with the measured _PROTEIN_ values . in contrast to the _LOCATION_ encoded subunits of the photosystem cores accumulation of _PROTEIN_ a _LOCATION_ encoded antenna protein associated with psii was unaltered in the atybey mutant . collectively the immunoblot data support the idea that the _PROTEIN_ of chloroplast genes is impaired in atybey mutant plants . the functions ascribed to the bacterial ybey protein and the obtained evidence for defective _LOCATION_ gene _PROTEIN_ in atybey mutants prompted us to investigate whether atybey mutations have an impact on chloroplast rrna processing . northern blot analysis using rna samples extracted from d old seedlings showed that the level of mature rrna was reduced in atybey seedlings while accumulation of the rrna precursor was increased compared with the wild type . additional hybridizations using probes that specifically recognize and unprocessed precursors revealed that both end and end maturation of the rrna were severely impaired in atybey plants . likewise rrna precursors and processing intermediates overaccumulated while mature transcripts were reduced in atybey plants . the overaccumulation of the precursor was confirmed by hybridization with specific probes that bind to and unprocessed precursor molecules . also abundance of the mature rrnas was slightly reduced in atybey plants compared with the wild type while pre rrnas overaccumulated in atybey . because rrnas are not stable if not assembled in ribosomal subunits rrna accumulation can serve as a proxy for ribosomal subunit accumulation . we therefore investigated the effect of atybey mutations on ribosome biogenesis at the cellular level . in atybey mutant plants the accumulation level of _LOCATION_ ribosomal subunits was reduced to about of the wild type level _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the rrna is further processed into and kb fragments . the ratio of also _PROTEIN_ whereas the ratio of slightly increased in atybey compared with the wild type . this result indicates that assembly of the ribosomal subunit is affected more severely than that of the subunit . taken together the ribosome accumulation data and the data from our rrna processing analyses suggest that _LOCATION_ ribosome biogenesis is specifically impaired upon atybey deficiency . the chloroplast rrna operon also contains three trna genes _PROTEIN_ trna and trnr . we examined whether the processing of these trna transcripts was affected in the atybey mutant . compared with the wild type the levels of mature _PROTEIN_ trna and trnr transcripts were moderately reduced in atybey plants while the polycistronic rrna operon precursor overaccumulated . the _PROTEIN_ and trna precursors were further analyzed using specific probes binding to their introns . no significant difference in the accumulation levels of the _PROTEIN_ and trna precursors was detected between the wild type and the atybey mutant suggesting that splicing of these two trnas is not affected by the atybey deficiency . to further assess the role of atybey in rrna processing and ends were mapped by circular reverse transcription pcr . as shown in figure among sequenced rrna molecules from the atybey mutant molecules were incorrectly processed at their end and at their end . the smallest fragment was consistently found to be a nucleotide rna in wild type plants . by contrast five molecules with a extension of nucleotides and molecules with different extensions were detected in the atybey mutant . likewise all clones sequenced for the second largest species represented the mature kb fragment in wild type plants whereas different extensions and different extensions were observed in the atybey mutant . additionally atybey deficiency led to accumulation of abnormal rrna molecules carrying extensions at their and/or ends . thus our findings indicate that atybey is involved in processing of both the and the ends of chloroplast rrnas . to test whether atybey has additional roles in the processing of other chloroplast rnas we examined the transcript levels of various chloroplast encoded and _LOCATION_ encoded genes using rna gel blot assay . no obvious differences between atybey and wild type plants were observed in transcript levels of _LOCATION_ encoded rna polymerase dependent genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ encoded rna polymerase dependent genes _PROTEIN_ and the examined _LOCATION_ genes for chloroplast proteins _PROTEIN_ . because protein accumulation of the _LOCATION_ encoded genes is reduced in the atybey mutant these data provide further evidence for atybey being required for chloroplast translation . interestingly overaccumulation of the _LOCATION_ encoded _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts was observed in the atybey mutant suggesting a possible relationship between atybey and mrna metabolism as proposed previously . rna gel blot analysis of a subset of _LOCATION_ trna genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ revealed overaccumulation in the atybey mutant . this could be a secondary consequence of the reduced usage of the trnas in translation which may make them more stable . however because the bacterial ybey protein is an endoribonuclease it is also possible that atybey has an additional role in mrna and trna metabolism in chloroplasts . to further confirm that protein biosynthesis in chloroplasts is impaired in atybey mutants we analyzed the association of chloroplast rnas with ribosomes . to this end polysomes were purified by suc density gradient centrifugation . northern blot analyses of fractionated polysome gradients revealed that the rrna profile of the atybey mutant was similar to that of the wild type . however the mature rrna was underrepresented in the polysomal fractions of the atybey mutant . similarly the mature hidden break products of the rrna were reduced in polysomal fractions of the mutant whereas the precursor overaccumulated in polysomes of atybey . we also examined the polysome association of six _LOCATION_ mrnas . compared with the wild type the mrnas of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were underrepresented in polysomal fractions from the atybey mutant indicating that these mrnas are associated with fewer ribosomes and hence their translation is reduced . taken together with defective processing of rrnas in atybey these results indicate that atybey deficiency leads to impaired _LOCATION_ rrna processing which in turn causes inefficient ribosome biogenesis and reduced translational activity in chloroplasts . to test whether atybey has rnase activity in vitro we purified recombinant atybey mutated atybey _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ and _METHOD_ proteins from e. coli for activity assay . recombinant atybey protein efficiently degraded total rrnas extracted from wild type plants while the mutated atybey _PROTEIN_ protein degraded them weakly . mutated e. coli ybey carrying the same amino acid exchanges was found to be ineffective in complementing the growth phenotype of the yeby mutant . in addition atybey moderately degraded _PROTEIN_ mrnas synthesized by in vitro transcription and had slight degrading activity toward chloroplast trna . as expected for a rnase atybey was unable to degrade either double or single stranded dna . consistent with its predicted metal dependent hydrolase activity atybey endoribonuclease activity was inhibited by edta a metal chelator . to further characterize the endoribonuclease activity of atybey we used synthetic or end biotin labeled oligoribonucleotide substrates mimicking the and terminus of the rrna . recombinant atybey displayed an endoribonuclease activity toward the synthetic substrates although it did not precisely cleave or terminal precursor sequences of the rna in vitro . taken together these in vitro results strongly suggest that atybey is an endoribonuclease .
