_LOCATION_ undergo dramatic changes in size shape number and position within the cell but the division process of _LOCATION_ has not been characterized . we screened a number of arabidopsis mutants with aberrant _LOCATION_ morphology . in one of these mutants _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ are long and reduced in number apparently as a result of inhibition of division . we showed that _PROTEIN_ encodes dynamin related protein _PROTEIN_ and that mutations in _PROTEIN_ also caused aberrant morphology of mitochondria . the transient _PROTEIN_ analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ is associated with the _LOCATION_ side of _LOCATION_ . these findings indicate that the same dynamin molecule is involved in peroxisomal and mitochondrial division in higher plants . we also report that the growth of arabidopsis which requires the cooperation of various organelles including _LOCATION_ and mitochondria is repressed in _PROTEIN_ indicating that the changes of morphology of _LOCATION_ and mitochondria reduce the efficiency of metabolism in these organelles .
to better understand peroxisomal division we attempted to generate mutants having _LOCATION_ with different sizes or shapes as these mutants would be expected to be defective in peroxisomal division . we used seeds of a transgenic arabidopsis termed _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in which _LOCATION_ with normal size and number can be visualized with _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seeds were mutagenized with ethylmethane sulfonate and allowed to germinate . of about plants examined under the _METHOD_ microscope we identified plants that had abnormal _LOCATION_ morphology . the apm mutants were classified into four classes . these were mutants with long _LOCATION_ giant _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ as well as in _LOCATION_ and other distributions of _METHOD_ . in the present study we focused on one class of the apm mutants referred to as _PROTEIN_ which have slightly larger _LOCATION_ with long string like tails . the lengths of _LOCATION_ are different in different organs . long shaped cells such as cells in the root hairs in the trichome and in the elongation zone of roots contain _LOCATION_ with a very long tail whose length is almost equal to the length of the cells . in addition the number of _LOCATION_ in the cells is markedly reduced . root hair cells have only one or two _LOCATION_ . the extent of appearance of aberrant _LOCATION_ is different between roots and leaves in the same plant . these results show that _PROTEIN_ mutants have defects in peroxisomal division and that peroxisomal division might be different between roots and leaves . immunoelectron microscopic analysis using anti _METHOD_ antibodies and antibodies raised against catalase which is a peroxisomal marker revealed the co localization of _METHOD_ and catalase . this _METHOD_ the presence of long _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ mutants . we investigated the morphology of other organelles especially chloroplasts and mitochondria . the _METHOD_ of chloroplasts revealed no differences in the size shape orientation or number between _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ alleles . the structures inside the chloroplasts such as grana stroma and starch grains were also indistinguishable between _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . these results indicate that the _PROTEIN_ mutation does not cause aberrant morphology of chloroplasts . next we examined mitochondria in protoplasts isolated from root cells of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the mitochondria in _PROTEIN_ are fewer and longer than those in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ although the morphological change of mitochondria was less dramatic than that of _LOCATION_ . in addition electron microscopic analyses revealed the presence of slightly long mitochondria as well as long _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ root cells compared to those in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . interestingly giant mitochondria in addition to long mitochondria were observed in leaf cells in _PROTEIN_ . on the other hand other organelles such as the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ apparatus and _LOCATION_ are indistinguishable between _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . therefore _PROTEIN_ is involved in the division of both _LOCATION_ and mitochondria . although _LOCATION_ are more abnormal in root cells than in leaf cells in _PROTEIN_ mutants the opposite is true for mitochondria . these results indicate that the _METHOD_ by which _PROTEIN_ regulates peroxisomal and mitochondrial division are somewhat different . we also investigated the relationship between the _PROTEIN_ mutation and peroxisomal and mitochondrial functions . _PROTEIN_ from storage lipids is necessary for the production of sucrose as the energy for germination and requires peroxisomal and mitochondrial functions . therefore peroxisomal oxidation defective mutants such as the _LOCATION_ defective _PROTEIN_ mutant require exogenous sucrose for germination _PROTEIN_ . although _PROTEIN_ mutants were able to germinate on medium without sucrose the root length in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was shorter than that of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . application of exogenous sucrose rescued the inhibition of root growth slightly but not completely suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ in activity of oxidation is not the only _PROTEIN_ for inhibition of root growth . we analyzed growth on medium with dichlorophenoxybutylic acid to confirm the reduction of activity for oxidation by another method . db is metabolized to the herbicide dichlorophenoxybutylic acid by the action of oxidation . accordingly the growth of wild type plants is inhibited on medium with db whereas oxidation defective mutants are able to germinate on medium with db _PROTEIN_ . the germination of three alleles _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ that we tested like that of wild type plants was inhibited on medium with db whereas the inhibition of germination in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was a little incomplete compared to that in _PROTEIN_ . however the root length of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is markedly shorter than that of _PROTEIN_ . this result confirmed the presence of other _PROTEIN_ except the _PROTEIN_ of activity for oxidation in _PROTEIN_ mutants although we can not exclude the possibility of the partial inhibition of activity for oxidation . in a normal atmosphere _PROTEIN_ mutants have different growth _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are indistinguishable morphologically . in contrast _PROTEIN_ represents the dwarf phenotype and the phenotype of _PROTEIN_ is more severe than that of _PROTEIN_ . as shown in figure aberrant _LOCATION_ are more abundant in _PROTEIN_ than in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the extent of dwarfism is consistent with the frequency of appearance of long _LOCATION_ . the wild type phenotype was recovered partially in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ when these mutants were grown in the presence of high _PROTEIN_ levels _PROTEIN_ in which case photorespiration is not required . we assumed that these effects were induced by the reduced activity of photorespiration . the reduction of photorespiration which also needs peroxisomal and mitochondrial functions represses plant growth . as activities for photorespiration in _PROTEIN_ and stm mutants are reduced they have yellow green leaves and show dwarf phenotypes . figure shows the result of the measurement of the maximal quantum yield of photosystem ii which can be estimated from the ratio of the variable _METHOD_ of dark _PROTEIN_ chlorophyll a to the maximum _METHOD_ . the fv/fm of the wild type plants would not be expected to change under strong illumination as photorespiration operates properly and photoinhibition is not induced . in an atmosphere containing high _PROTEIN_ under low light which reduces the effect of photoinhibition _PROTEIN_ mutants and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ had similar fv/fm values of approximately . these plants were then transferred to a normal atmosphere _PROTEIN_ where they were illuminated with a strong light . under these conditions the fv/fm ratios of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ as time passed . in case of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the values were as same as that of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . however the reduction of the fv/fm ratio of _PROTEIN_ was more severe than those of another alleles showing the reduction of activity for photorespiration in _PROTEIN_ mutant . the _PROTEIN_ mutation segregates as a monogenic recessive gene . we identified _PROTEIN_ alleles and determined that the _PROTEIN_ encodes a dynamin related protein that has been annotated as _PROTEIN_ . the nucleotide sequences of the alleles were identical except for single nucleotide substitutions . four alleles _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ have nonsense mutations at the codons encoding and respectively while alleles _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ have amino acid substitutions . in _PROTEIN_ the deletion of nucleotide causes a frameshift and produces a stop codon in the seventh exon . other alleles _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ have the mutations at the splice sites . to confirm that we had identified the correct gene the _PROTEIN_ cdna was _PROTEIN_ in an _PROTEIN_ background under the control of constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus promoter by in planta transformation . transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ have normal _LOCATION_ and mitochondria as shown in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and the root lengths of independent transgenic lines were almost as long as that of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in case of germination on medium without sucrose . these results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ cdna is able to restore wild type morphology in homozygous _PROTEIN_ . the presence of several alleles with independent mutations in the _PROTEIN_ and the finding that the wild type morphology can be restored by the _PROTEIN_ of the cdna indicate that the gene we identified is _PROTEIN_ . to identify the localization of _PROTEIN_ within cells we carried out a transient _PROTEIN_ analysis . the constructs of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were introduced into root cells of transgenic arabidopsis red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ whose _LOCATION_ were visualized with _METHOD_ by particle bombardment . as shown in figure the signal from _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is observed on the outside of _METHOD_ labeled _LOCATION_ . we obtained the same results in the case of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in addition when these constructs were introduced into root cells of transgenic arabidopsis mt _METHOD_ whose mitochondria were visualized with _METHOD_ the interaction with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and mitochondria was observed . this is in good agreement with the result by citation indicating that _PROTEIN_ is able to interact with _LOCATION_ as well as mitochondria . it has been reported that _PROTEIN_ is localized in chloroplasts where it may be involved in vesicle formation in the chloroplast . therefore we investigate the interaction with chloroplasts using the same constructs in the wild type leaf cells . as shown in figure we did not observe any co localization in _METHOD_ signal from _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and the _METHOD_ from chloroplasts . as shown in figure the morphology of chloroplasts was indistinguishable between _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ mutants . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is not localized in chloroplasts and that it is not involved in the division of chloroplasts .
_PROTEIN_ mutants and wild type plants of arabidopsis thaliana were grown as described previously by citation . germination was induced by a h incubation at followed by white light at . seeds were surface sterilized in naclo plus triton x and grown on germination media _METHOD_ sucrose myo inositol thiamin hcl pyridoxine nicotinic acid mes koh and agar . tissues of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were prepared and examined using an _PROTEIN_ laser scanning confocal microscope as previously described by citation . to visualize mitochondria _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plantlets were treated with a buffer containing cellulase onozuka rs pectolyase y m mannitol and mm mes koh for min to isolate protoplasts . subsequently protoplasts were soaked in mitotracker orange cm solution for min and observed using a rhodamine filter set . _PROTEIN_ homozygotes which were backcrossed three times with the parent plant _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were crossed with another ecotype landsberg _LOCATION_ . a total of progenies _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotypes were scored according to their genetic background as revealed by a series of cleaved amplified polymorphic length and simple sequence length polymorphism markers . rough mapping revealed that the _PROTEIN_ locus is located between the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ markers on chromosome . for fine mapping we made several sets of oligonucleotide primers for caps and sslp markers according to the cereon genomics database . a marker on a bacterial artificial chromosome clone is the one nearest to the _PROTEIN_ locus . examination of the nucleotide sequences in in the arabidopsis genome sequence project identified a gene as a possible candidate . based on this nucleotide sequence we designated a set of oligonucleotide primers that could amplify the predicted gene by pcr . dna fragments corresponding to this region were amplified from the genomic dnas of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ alleles using the same primer set and were fully sequenced . arabidopsis roots and leaves were harvested from _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . ultrathin sectioning microscopic analysis and immunogold labeling were performed as described previously by citation . to reduce the effect of photoinhibition plants were grown for days in an atmosphere containing pa _PROTEIN_ under low light . these plants were then illuminated with strong light for and min in a normal atmosphere _PROTEIN_ . after the end of each illumination period plants were kept for min in the dark . the ratio of fv/fm was automatically calculated from the result of the modulated chlorophyll _METHOD_ emission from the upper surface of dark _PROTEIN_ leaves which was measured using a pulse amplitude modulation fluorometer _PROTEIN_ . the constructs of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion genes which were kindly provided by drs tsutsumi and arimura were introduced into root cells from transgenic arabidopsis _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ mt _METHOD_ or leaf cells from wild type arabidopsis using a particle delivery system according to the manufacturer 's instruction _PROTEIN_ . the conditions of bombardment were a vacuum of in . of hg helium pressure of psi and cm of target distance using gold particles . after bombardment tissues were incubated on the _METHOD_ plates for h for and observed under a confocal laser scanning microscope .
