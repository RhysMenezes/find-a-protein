transforming growth _PROTEIN_ is a secreted protein that regulates proliferation differentiation and death in various cell types including thyroid cells although few details are known about its _METHOD_ of action in this cell type . here we studied the role of tgf on the regulation of sodium/iodide symporter gene _PROTEIN_ in pc thyroid cells . tgf inhibits thyroid stimulated hormone _PROTEIN_ induced nis mrna and protein levels in a dose dependent manner . this effect takes place at the transcriptional level as tgf inhibits _PROTEIN_ induced transcription of a luciferase reporter construct containing a kb dna fragment of the rat nis promoter . the inhibitory effect of tgf was partially overcome by inhibitory and mimicked by overexpression of either or a constitutively activated mutant of tgf receptor i . using internal deletions of the promoter we defined a region between to which includes the nis upstream enhancer as responsible for the tgf inhibitory effect . nue contains two binding sites for the paired domain transcription _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ controlling nis transcription . the physical interaction observed between and appears to be responsible for the _PROTEIN_ in binding to dna . _PROTEIN_ of mrna and protein was also _PROTEIN_ by tgf treatment . the results suggest that through activation of tgf _PROTEIN_ dna binding activity as well as mrna and protein levels which are at least partially involved in tgf induced down regulation of nis gene _PROTEIN_ in thyroid follicular cells . our results thus demonstrate a novel mechanism of function in regulating thyroid cell differentiation by functionally antagonizing the action of the paired domain transcription _PROTEIN_ .
tgf inhibits _PROTEIN_ induced nis mrna and protein pc cells were treated with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ plus tgf and nis mrna and protein levels were analyzed by northern and western blot assays . as described _PROTEIN_ stimulated nis mrna and protein levels and tgf repressed the stimulatory effect of _PROTEIN_ in a dose dependent manner . the maximum inhibitory effect was reached at ng/ml tgf . these data demonstrated that tgf interferes with _PROTEIN_ induction of nis gene _PROTEIN_ . tgf down regulates _PROTEIN_ dependent transcriptional activation of the nis study whether tgf regulates transcription of the nis gene we used a kb fragment of the rat nis promoter . the pnis contains the nue a regulatory element necessary for a full _PROTEIN_ response . luciferase reporter constructs containing the full length dna fragment or deletion derivatives were transiently transfected into pc cells and assayed for transcriptional activity in response to _PROTEIN_ and tgf _PROTEIN_ induced a significant stimulation of pnis activity whereas tgf _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ mediated transactivation in a dose dependent manner . the nis promoter activity was not affected by tgf in the absence of _PROTEIN_ . to identify the promoter region responsible for tgf regulation we analyzed the transcriptional activity of the nue less deletion constructs pnis pnis and pnis . as described previously the nue is required for full _PROTEIN_ stimulation of the nis gene and tgf had no effect on the transcriptional activity of any deletion constructs . tgf inhibition was thus abolished in chimeras that do not bear the nue enhancer . the transfection of the constructs pnis pnis nue and pnis nue showed a significant activity in response to _PROTEIN_ as well as a reduction in luciferase activity when tgf was added together with _PROTEIN_ for h . in summary the results indicate that tgf interferes with _PROTEIN_ dependent transcriptional activation of the nis gene and that tgf requires elements within or adjacent to the nue for this regulation . nis gene repression by tgf is signaled by the smad analyze the mechanism by which tgf down regulates _PROTEIN_ induced nis gene transcription we studied the intracellular mediators of the tgf pathway . a signaling cascade is initiated after tgf binding resulting in r smad activation oligomerization with and the subsequent translocation of the smad complex to the _LOCATION_ where it participates in regulation of gene transcription . to assess smad involvement in the tgf effect we cotransfected the rnis promoter construct with _PROTEIN_ vectors harboring or . _PROTEIN_ stimulated nis promoter activity was _PROTEIN_ by overexpression of and . as predicted the strongest inhibition was observed when both smads were _PROTEIN_ . the inhibition induced by might be caused by interaction with endogenous . overexpression of smad proteins thus mimicked the inhibitory effect of tgf on the nis gene transcription shown above supporting a role for the smad pathway in tgf action . as overexpression did not reproduce the tgf effect on nis promoter activity we discarded its mediation in tgf transcriptional repression . to confirm the participation of smad signaling in tgf regulation of nis we transfected pc cells with pnis in the presence of the constitutively activated that phosphorylates and activates tgf dependent r smads . through activation of endogenous smads acalk overexpression reduced _PROTEIN_ stimulated nis gene transcription mimicking the effect of tgf . acalk mediated inhibition was dependent on the amount of vector _PROTEIN_ in the cell and was similar to that exerted by tgf . we also analyzed the transcriptional activity of the nis promoter in the presence of an inhibitory smad . _METHOD_ a stable association with the activated type i receptors preventing phosphorylation of r smads and blocking downstream tgf signaling . transient overexpression of in pc cells partially abrogated repression of nis promoter activity by tgf . at the same concentrations partially prevented inhibition of the nis promoter construct by acalk indicating the specificity of in blocking smad mediated transcriptional repression . altogether the results firmly establish the functional requirement for in mediating tgf transcriptional repression . _LOCATION_ accumulation of and by tgf and normally reside in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells and are imported to the _LOCATION_ as complexes in response to tgf signaling to regulate target gene transcription . because the _LOCATION_ entry of the smads is a key step in signal transduction we analyzed the accumulation of and in the _LOCATION_ of pc cells after tgf treatment . we observed a rapid and a striking increase in both proteins in the _LOCATION_ fraction with a parallel _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ fraction . this effect is tgf specific because _PROTEIN_ alone did not induce smad translocation to the _LOCATION_ . after prolonged tgf treatment and levels in _LOCATION_ extracts fall although a corresponding increase was not detected in the cytoplasmic fraction . this effect could be explained by the previously described degradation of smads induced after long treatment with tgf . our results showed accumulation of both smads in the pc cell _LOCATION_ confirming activation of the smad signaling pathway by tgf and supporting smad participation as intracellular effectors of tgf action in thyroid follicular cells . tgf _PROTEIN_ the binding of to its response element in the nis nue has two binding sites which are required to obtain the full _PROTEIN_ dependent transcription . here we demonstrate that tgf requires the nue to _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ dependent transcriptional activation of nis . these observations prompted us to analyze whether tgf modified the ability of to bind dna . for the assay we used a radiolabeled synthetic oligonucleotide probe oligo _PROTEIN_ spanning to bp of the rnis promoter . the band shift assay showed that _PROTEIN_ stimulates binding to nue compared with unstimulated cells . these data showed a reduction in the intensity of the dna complex in tgf treated cells compared with the control . complex specificity was confirmed by competition with the related but not with an unrelated oligonucleotide . it is also displaced by an antibody that recognizes a dna binding domain epitope . a supershift was observed with another antibody raised against a peptide mapping downstream of the paired domain . the same tgf regulation was observed when the _PROTEIN_ oligonucleotide containing the other nue binding site was used . the results indicate that tgf alters binding to the nis promoter an event that could explain tgf inhibition of nis promoter activity . although smad binding elements are often present in the responsive region of tgf target genes we could not attribute the modulation of nis gene transcription to sbe because we did not observe binding of activated smads to sbe motifs in the nis promoter . on the other hand we never found binding of recombinant smad proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to the binding elements in the nis promoter . physical interaction between and proteins regulate transcription in collaboration with other transcription _PROTEIN_ through direct protein protein interactions . we thus studied a potential physical interaction between and using _PROTEIN_ pull down assays . is a _PROTEIN_ terminal deletion of which includes the dna binding domain and lacks the transactivation domain . both recombinant full length and form complexes with _PROTEIN_ linked to sepharose beads but not with _PROTEIN_ beads in a cell free system . the observation that the truncated binds the _PROTEIN_ indicates that the physical interaction between and proteins does not involve the activation domain whereas the amino terminal end of appears to be sufficient for this interaction . in a second experimental approach physical interactions between and were also demonstrated in vitro using a _PROTEIN_ pull down assay with _LOCATION_ pc cell extracts . specifically fusion proteins consisting of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or the _PROTEIN_ portion alone coupled to sepharose beads were incubated with _LOCATION_ extracts of quiescent pc cells or cells treated with _PROTEIN_ plus tgf . interaction between and was confirmed through the complexes formed with _PROTEIN_ beads and endogenous as well as with _PROTEIN_ beads and endogenous . no interaction was found with _PROTEIN_ beads . dna binding activity of to the nis promoter is reduced by we demonstrated that tgf _PROTEIN_ dna binding to the nis promoter and also found a physical interaction between and . we studied the possible role of in regulation of dna complex using recombinant _PROTEIN_ . the band shift assay performed with _LOCATION_ extract from pc cells or recombinant showed that as the _PROTEIN_ concentration increased the amount of dna complex _PROTEIN_ . no effect was found with _PROTEIN_ alone . these findings indicate that is able to inhibit a dna complex dependent upon the association of with the paired domain . tgf _PROTEIN_ mrna and protein levels of in pc also studied _PROTEIN_ of mrna and protein in response to tgf . the results demonstrated that tgf down regulated _PROTEIN_ stimulated mrna and protein levels . as predicted the _PROTEIN_ in mrna levels preceded the down regulation of protein _PROTEIN_ . all together the results indicate that tgf interferes with transcriptional activation of the nis promoter by two _METHOD_ that include an initial physical interaction between and and the _PROTEIN_ negative regulation of _PROTEIN_ .
