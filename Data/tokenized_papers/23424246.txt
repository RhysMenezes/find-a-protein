micrornas play key regulatory roles in numerous developmental and physiological processes in animals and plants . the elaborate mechanism of mirna biogenesis involves transcription and multiple processing steps . here we report the identification of a pair of evolutionarily conserved domain containing proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as components involved in arabidopsis thaliana mirna biogenesis . was identified by its interaction with the piwi/ago/zwille domain of dicer _PROTEIN_ an interaction that is conserved between rice and arabidopsis thaliana . inactivation of both genes in arabidopsis caused severe defects in male gametophytes and weak lines show pleiotropic defects reminiscent of mirna pathway mutants . impairment of _PROTEIN_ the accumulation of primary mirnas and mature mirnas and affects _PROTEIN_ but not hyponastic _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ localization in vivo . in addition _PROTEIN_ protein interacts with polymerase ii and other mirna processing _PROTEIN_ including two cap binding proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . finally we found that the mrna levels of some protein coding genes were also affected . therefore these results suggest that proteins act as general _PROTEIN_ to promote the transcription of protein coding as well as mirna genes and facilitate efficient _PROTEIN_ recruitment in mirna biogenesis .
our previous work demonstrated that os _PROTEIN_ is a key enzyme in rice mirna biogenesis . the piwi/ago/zwille _PROTEIN_ domain a conserved functional domain of _PROTEIN_ recognizes the end of the double stranded rna allowing _PROTEIN_ to measure and generate small rnas of the correct size . to further study the precise mechanism of rice mirna biogenesis we selected the _PROTEIN_ domain as a bait to screen for potential interacting partners associated with _PROTEIN_ . from this yeast two hybrid screen we identified the c terminal region of os as being represented by positive clones at the highest frequency . to further substantiate the interaction between os and os _PROTEIN_ we used stable coexpression of ad os _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and bd os in yeast and found this combination activated the and lacz reporter genes further confirming the bona fide interaction between os _PROTEIN_ and os . to further characterize the biological roles of in plants we first used rna interference to knock down os in rice . the transgenic rice with reduced os levels either could not regenerate from callus or became arrested at an early seedling stage indicating that os is vital for rice development . the lethality of os rnai in transgenic rice restricted further study of os therefore we next studied the function of in arabidopsis based on the high sequence conservation of proteins between rice and arabidopsis . to determine whether the interactions between _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ exist in arabidopsis we used yeast two hybrid assays . we generated the appropriate constructs with the arabidopsis proteins and cotransformed them into yeast . we found that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ both interact with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in yeast . to further verify this interaction we performed pull down assays using maltose binding protein his tagged _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ as a bait and glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as a prey . nickel pull down and immunoblotting assays showed that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ capture _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ efficiently in vitro compared with _PROTEIN_ alone . the similarities between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ prompted us to test the relationship of these two proteins . extensive interactions between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as well as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were detected in yeast two hybrid assays . the results indicated that both proteins can form heterodimers or homodimers and may act as a functional unit in vivo . in the following experiments _PROTEIN_ is used as a representative to explore the function of proteins . we first used protein deletions to determine which domain of interacts with _PROTEIN_ . the domain a conserved motif of os proteins is responsible for interaction with the _PROTEIN_ domain of os _PROTEIN_ according to our yeast two hybrid assay . the domain of _PROTEIN_ has been found to act as a repressor of promoters in reporter gene activity assays using in vitro transient transfections of human cells . thus we examined if the conserved domain of arabidopsis contributes to the interaction with _PROTEIN_ . three versions of mbp his tagged _PROTEIN_ including full length _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ full length with the domain deleted and the domain only were _PROTEIN_ for pull down assays . the protein that lacks the motif did not show an interaction with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but itself completely retained this association . the data thus indicate that the c terminal domain mediates the interaction with _PROTEIN_ . the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was also confirmed by examination of their subcellular locations using protein fusions with _METHOD_ markers transiently _PROTEIN_ in epidermal cells of n. benthamiana . the yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ localized in the _LOCATION_ which is consistent with previous reports . when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ were coexpressed _PROTEIN_ signals clearly overlapped with those of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . collectively these results indicated that proteins physically associate with _PROTEIN_ in rice and arabidopsis and the domain is critical for the direct interaction . to determine the physiological roles of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we identified the t dna insertion mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from the salk or nottingham arabidopsis stock centre collections . _PROTEIN_ is a null allele and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are weak alleles with reduced _PROTEIN_ transcript levels . under normal growth conditions the single mutants did not display any obvious developmental defects . however we failed to obtain the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant implying that the homozygous double mutant is likely unable to survive . to confirm this hypothesis we examined the fertility of _PROTEIN_ plants which should produce homozygous mutants as of their progeny . indeed we found some aborted ovules in the siliques of _PROTEIN_ . we classified these mutants as weak medium and severe based on the length of siliques which corresponded to the ratio of aborted ovules ranging from to . we further examined whether the mutant alleles were transmitted through the male and female gametophytes at the expected frequency . statistical analysis of the progeny of reciprocal crosses to the wild type with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ plants demonstrated that the transmission of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ alleles occurs at lower frequencies in both female and male gametophytes . the female gametophyte transmission showed a moderate _PROTEIN_ from the expected to in _PROTEIN_ plants indicating that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are important for normal female gametophyte development in arabidopsis . however the transmission of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ through the male gamete was and respectively instead of the expected in the wild type implying that absence of the homozygous double mutants is largely due to defects in male gametogenesis . also staining the anthers of _PROTEIN_ plants with alexander s stain revealed to nonviable pollen in the wild type there was < abnormal pollen . we next examined pollen formation in the mutants to determine the nature of the defect . during arabidopsis microgametogenesis meiosis of the microspore mother cell produces a tetrad of microspores . after release from the tetrad each microspore undergoes an asymmetric cell division pollen mitosis i to generate a bicellular pollen grain containing a generative cell and a much larger vegetative cell . then the generative cell _METHOD_ a second cell division pollen mitosis ii to give rise to a tricellular pollen . to further determine at which stage the aberrant pollen grains of _PROTEIN_ were arrested diamidino phenylindole staining was applied to observe the pollen _LOCATION_ at different developmental stages . we observed degenerated and aberrant pollen grains that did not stain with dapi at the tricellular bicellular and microspore stages in _PROTEIN_ plants indicating that male gamete defects occur at or before pollen mitosis i . the functional roles of in reproductive cells are also consistent with their high _PROTEIN_ in carpels and stamens . these results suggest redundant roles of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in early male and female gametophyte development . we also isolated a weak double mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which exhibits pleiotropic phenotypes including crumpled and serrated rosette leaves and _PROTEIN_ flowering . these phenotypes are similar to those of mirna biogenesis pathway mutants such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ se and _PROTEIN_ . to further confirm the abnormal phenotypes of loss of function of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we generated transgenic plants with knockdown of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ background . two lines designated as rnai and rnai showed slightly enhanced phenotypes similar to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . these observations suggested that the defects in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants are due to loss of function of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the combined evidence that binds _PROTEIN_ and that the phenotype of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is reminiscent of mirna biogenesis pathway mutants prompted us to test whether mirnas were affected by inactivation of . indeed we found that in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or rnai lines all nine tested mirnas were reduced in abundance by to fold relative to the wild type . mirna biogenesis is a sequential process proceeding _PROTEIN_ through three steps transcription of pri mirna pri mirna processing to pre mirna and pre mirna processing to mature mirna . to determine how mirna biogenesis was affected by we first examined the levels of pri mirnas . quantitative rt pcr revealed that the levels of pri mirnas at five mir loci _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were reduced by nearly twofold in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and rnai lines . this observation is in contrast with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ se and _PROTEIN_ mutants in which pri mirna transcripts accumulate to much higher levels than the wild type . this suggested that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are likely involved in transcriptional regulation of mir genes . to confirm that regulate mirna transcription we used a _PROTEIN_ reporter to test the effect of mutation of on gus _PROTEIN_ driven by the _PROTEIN_ promoter . the transgenic plants containing gus were crossed to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the individuals containing gus along with either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were isolated from the population for gus staining . gus _PROTEIN_ was markedly _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ compared with _PROTEIN_ . by contrast gus _PROTEIN_ driven by the promoter of a protein coding gene _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ did not exhibit reduction in the two genotypes . these results indicated that promote mir transcription . next we tested how regulate mir transcription . mir genes are predominately transcribed by pol ii we therefore examined the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and pol ii by pull down assays . the purified mbp his tagged _PROTEIN_ protein on beads was incubated with a crude protein extract of wild type arabidopsis seedlings and immunoblotting was conducted to determine whether pol ii was retained by the beads . pol ii _PROTEIN_ was coprecipitated with mbp his tagged _PROTEIN_ but not with mbp his only . furthermore a pull down experiment was performed using mbp his tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as the bait and _PROTEIN_ tagged c terminal domain of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as the prey . nickel pull down and immunoblotting showed retention of _PROTEIN_ mbp his along with ctd _PROTEIN_ but not with the _PROTEIN_ control indicating that _PROTEIN_ interacts directly with the ctd of pol ii . this result provided further support for the interaction between and pol ii . thus we conclude that promote mir _PROTEIN_ via interacting with pol ii . in arabidopsis pri mirnas are transcribed by pol ii and subsequently form fold back structures to recruit proteins necessary for their posttranscriptional processing . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interact and colocalize with each other forming a pri mirna processing and/or storage complex or center . the observation that physically associated with _PROTEIN_ and pol ii suggested that might act as a scaffold to bridge mirna transcription and _PROTEIN_ recruitment . we used bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation to determine whether can also interact with other proteins involved in pri mirna processing . as a positive control we found that _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ in discrete foci in the nucleoplasm which is consistent with previously published observations . intriguingly we observed that intense bifc _METHOD_ appeared when _PROTEIN_ was coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but bifc _METHOD_ was not observed for the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ pairs . independent assays by yeast two hybrid and pull down also confirmed that associated with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but not with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . consistent with previous studies we also observed that _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ in vivo and thus is part of the cbp complex . additionally we showed that _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ binds _PROTEIN_ in vivo and in vitro which further supports the hypothesis that cbc and _PROTEIN_ share common molecular functions . these data suggested that _PROTEIN_ may affect mirna biogenesis by binding _PROTEIN_ directly . therefore the cbc might be required for forming a pri mirna processing center by interacting with _PROTEIN_ directly or indirectly . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins are involved in pri mirna processing and they interact with each other directly or indirectly . protein interacts with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ therefore we proposed that may assist in the recruitment of these components to form an efficient processing center . to test this hypothesis we examined the effects of impairment on the localization of two major mirna processing components _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . a previous study revealed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ containing bodies distribute throughout the nucleoplasm and of plant cells harbor two or fewer _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ speckles in wild type arabidopsis . we used the population generated from transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ crossed to the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant and counted the number of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ bodies in each root cell in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ backgrounds . in the wild type most cells contained one or two _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ speckles consistent with a previous report . by contrast we observed three to four _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ speckles in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ root cells . statistical analysis based on observations of and _LOCATION_ of the wild type and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ respectively showed a significant increase in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ speckle number in the double mutant . by contrast the numbers of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ speckles were not significantly increased in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ compared with that in the wild type root cells . we also analyzed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and both showed equivalent induction in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which rules out the possibility that the increased number of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ speckles was due to upregulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . based on its positive regulatory role on mir transcription and its interaction with multiple mirna processing _PROTEIN_ we propose that coordinates the recruitment of _PROTEIN_ bodies onto pri mirnas subsequent to mir transcription loss of probably leads to the mislocalization of its direct interaction partner _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ which does not interact with directly . the association between and pol ii raised the question of whether affect pri mirnas specifically or act as general _PROTEIN_ in transcription . to address this question we performed high throughput rna sequencing using rna samples from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and wild type seedlings . the data quality is summarized in supplemental table online . compared with wild type columbia several mir genes were significantly reduced which is consistent with our quantitative rt pcr analysis . we also found downregulated and upregulated genes in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ respectively . the _PROTEIN_ levels of some downregulated genes were validated in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants and rnai lines . we found that the _PROTEIN_ of selected genes _PROTEIN_ was significantly reduced in the mutant or rnai lines indicating that might be a general _PROTEIN_ associated with pol ii promoting transcription at both mir and protein coding genes .
