_PROTEIN_ the target of the antibiotic rapamycin in both yeast and mammalian cells is a potent cell growth regulator in all eukaryotes . it acts through the phosphorylation of downstream effectors that are recruited to it by the binding partner raptor . in arabidopsis raptor activity is essential for postembryonic growth . though comparative studies suggest potential downstream effectors no raptor binding partners have been described in plants . _PROTEIN_ a plant raptor homologue binds the _PROTEIN_ protein in a yeast two hybrid assay . this interaction is mediated by the n terminal residues of _PROTEIN_ and marks _PROTEIN_ as a candidate attor kinase substrate in plants . the _PROTEIN_ n terminus additionally carries transcriptional activation domain activity . plants homozygous for insertion alleles at the _PROTEIN_ locus as well as plants homozygous for insertion alleles at all five loci in the aml gene family bolt earlier than wild type plants . _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ homologue of a protein that recruits substrates for phosphorylation by the major cell growth regulator _PROTEIN_ . identification of _PROTEIN_ as a putative downstream effector of _PROTEIN_ gives valuable insights into the plant specific mode of action of this critical growth regulator .
to test for an interaction between the arabidopsis proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the open reading frames of each of the transcripts predicted to encode these proteins were amplified via pcr with primers carrying suitable restriction sites for cloning into the yeast two hybrid vectors and . encodes a transcriptional activation domain which can recruit the yeast transcription machinery . encodes a dna binding domain which binds to the promoters of and . and additionally carry the genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . when transformed into the yeast line which is _PROTEIN_ co transformed cells will grow on yeast medium lacking leucine and tryptophan . cells co transformed with two hybrid constructs encoding proteins that interact will grow on media additionally lacking histidine and adenine . yeast cells co transformed with clones encoding _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in complementary two hybrid vectors grew on selective media . co transformations of control and empty vectors or either control vector co transformed with its complement harboring the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ orf yielded cells able to grow on media lacking leucine and tryptophan but not on selective media . evidence from other _METHOD_ indicates that raptor protein fragments lose the ability to bind substrates . therefore only full length _PROTEIN_ was tested in this assay . the fission yeast _PROTEIN_ homologue is highly modular . it is divided into distinct n terminal and c terminal domains . the n terminal half of the protein appears to play a regulatory role _PROTEIN_ . the c terminal half of is sufficient to complement lesions in the locus _PROTEIN_ . additionally the _PROTEIN_ c terminal half _PROTEIN_ in fission yeast meiosis signaling mutants is able to complement meiosis signaling defects upstream of _PROTEIN_ . therefore we generated clones encoding fragments of _PROTEIN_ and assayed them for interactions with full length _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ fragments and comprised of the first or the first residues of the residue _PROTEIN_ protein restored growth on media lacking leucine tryptophan histidine and adenine when cloned into and co transformed with pgbk raptor . neither nor nor could restore growth when cloned into and co transformed with pgbk raptor . _PROTEIN_ fragment comprised of residues to the c terminus of the protein and all c terminal fragments tested failed to restore growth on selective medium . none of the _PROTEIN_ fragments cloned into and cotransformed with empty control vector yielded transformants able to grow on selective medium . _PROTEIN_ cloned into restored growth on selective medium to cells co transformed with either pgad raptor or . to investigate this result further we tested all _PROTEIN_ fragments for native transcriptional activation domain activity in a yeast one hybrid assay . _PROTEIN_ fragments were cloned into singly transformed into yeast cells and assayed for growth on media lacking tryptophan and media additionally lacking adenine . the dna binding domain of the tethers any c terminally fused fragments to the promoter . in the absence of a binding partner bd fusion chimeric proteins trigger transcription of only if the protein fused to the bd contains native transcriptional activation activity . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but not full length _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or any c terminal _PROTEIN_ fragments were able to restore growth on media lacking tryptophan and adenine . _PROTEIN_ was similarly unable to restore growth . _PROTEIN_ fragments and in could not be stably transformed into yeast . these results were observed in multiple independent transformant lines for a given construct . cotransformation of any of the derived constructs with did not affect the growth of any of the transformed lines on media lacking tryptophan and adenine . an interaction with _PROTEIN_ points to _PROTEIN_ as a downstream effector of _PROTEIN_ signaling in plants . additionally the dramatic phenotype disruption and the intriguing mode of action led us to ask what the consequences would be of disruption of the _PROTEIN_ locus and of all five aml gene family members . to obtain insertion alleles in _PROTEIN_ and other aml gene family members we screened the insertion allele populations at the university of wisconsin arabidopsis knockout facility _PROTEIN_ obtaining alleles harboring insertions in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . an _PROTEIN_ insertion allele was obtained from the signal collection at the salk institute _PROTEIN_ . by rt pcr using primers which anneal to the cdna at sites spanning the insertion site of each insertion allele we established that no wild type transcripts accumulate in homozygous mutants . by a series of crosses we then generated higher order insertion homozygotes culminating in the quintuple insertion homozygotes and . all lines were viable and fertile . aml insertion homozygotes bolted earlier than wild type lines . this effect was independent of the number of insertion alleles carried by the mutants aml 'quint lines and were not qualitatively different than lower order insertion allele homozygotes . additionally aml insertion homozygote seedlings were assayed for a differential response to a range of signaling molecules . seedlings were germinated on culture medium supplemented with the gibberellic acid _PROTEIN_ paclobutrazol the auxin d amino cyclopropane _PROTEIN_ acid sucrose sucrose and kinetin and in the dark . quintuple insertion mutants responded slightly more than wild type seedlings to _PROTEIN_ as measured by the change in seedling length in the presence vs. in the absence of the hormone . this effect was repeatable but weak and no other differential hormonal response was observed . given the mild phenotype of the aml insertion homozygotes we further investigated the extent of the effect of the insertions at each locus . rt pcr as previously stated showed that no wild type transcripts accumulate in lines and . in fission yeast however the c terminal half of the protein is sufficient to complement lesions of the locus _PROTEIN_ . the insertion alleles of all but _PROTEIN_ are disrupted at or near the ends of their predicted coding regions . we therefore designed primers that anneal to the region downstream of the insertion site in each allele and performed polymerase chain reactions to assay for accumulation of fragments capable of encoding the c terminal half of any of the aml proteins . to determine whether the amplified fragments corresponded to aml cdnas we performed restriction digests on the pcr products which confirmed that the cdnas originated from aml gene transcripts . weak amplification of cdna representing transcripts originating downstream of the insertion site was observed for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ amplification of the _PROTEIN_ region was indistinguishable from the amplification seen from of wild type cdna template . the _PROTEIN_ orf was separately cloned into the _METHOD_ plant transformation vector both and of the _METHOD_ orf and the construct was transformed into arabidopsis via agrobacterium mediated floral dip _PROTEIN_ . transformants identified by resistance to the antibiotic hygromycin and confirmed through pcr were recovered at a very low rate of less than . no _METHOD_ was observed in any tissues of any transformants assayed and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transcripts could not be detected via rt pcr performed on cdna transcribed from rna extracted from bulk shoot tissue .
_PROTEIN_ was cloned via rt pcr . the cdna template was reverse transcribed using omniscript from rna extracted from bulk shoot tissue using trizol reagent . restriction sites ncoi and xmai/smai were added to the and ends of the orf and of all smaller _PROTEIN_ fragments via pcr using extaq high fidelity polymerase . an est clone tagging _PROTEIN_ was obtained from kazusa dna institute and sequenced . restriction sites ncoi and ecori were added at the and ends of the orf via pcr . and are distributed by bdbiosciences . cells _PROTEIN_ were grown in yepda liquid plates or on yepda plates with g/l agar y _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . cells were transformed using the yeastmaker yeast transformation and plated on medium lacking the appropriate macronutrients _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . colonies were observed days after transformation . dna from lines harboring insertion alleles was extracted using the alkaline boiling method . provisional homozygotes were confirmed via a second extraction using the c tab dna extraction protocol . pcr to assay for wild type and insertion alleles was performed in ul volumes using extaq polymerase and buffers and the following cycling parameters seconds seconds minutes cycles . genotyping primers were as follows _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ jl jl proc . the wild type loci were assayed with the above pairs . the insert was assayed using the following pairs _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ with jl or jl _PROTEIN_ with proc _PROTEIN_ with jl or jl _PROTEIN_ with jl or jl _PROTEIN_ with jl . insertions in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ loci were obtained from the university of wisconsin alpha collection using their described protocol and are in the wassiljewskia ecotype background . the _PROTEIN_ insertion was found in pool . the _PROTEIN_ insertion was found in pool . insertions in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ loci were obtained from the university of wisconsin basta collection and are in the ws background . the _PROTEIN_ insertion was found in pool f. the _PROTEIN_ insertion was found in pool h. the insertion in _PROTEIN_ was obtained from the line from the salk collection and is in the columbia ecotype background . aside from regions genetically linked to any of the insertion loci the aml quintuple insertion allele homozygote lines are in the genomic background of a col ws individual once backcrossed to the ws background . rna extraction was performed using _PROTEIN_ reagent essentially according to manufacturer 's instructions . total rna was treated with dna dnase and reverse transcribed using omniscript reverse transcriptase with an oligo dt primer . primer pairs spanning the insertion site for rt pcr on all five lines are as follows _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . reactions were performed using takara extaq and cycles of for sec annealing _PROTEIN_ or annealing _PROTEIN_ for sec and for one minute . primer pairs amplifying a region of the insertion site for rt pcr on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ insertion homozygotes are as follows _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . all reactions were performed with a annealing temperature .
