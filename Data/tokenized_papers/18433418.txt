the dynamics of the thiol disulphide redox proteome is central to cell function and its regulation . altered mobility of proteins in the oxidized and reduced state allows the _METHOD_ identification of those thiol disulphide proteins that undergo major conformational changes . a proteomic approach was taken with _LOCATION_ luminal and _PROTEIN_ stromal subproteome fractions of the chloroplast from arabidopsis thaliana . among the verified polypeptides were novel redox proteins previously not reported as being part of the redox proteome . among the proteins were _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ chloroplast monodehydroascorbate reductase and also the _PROTEIN_ protease . recombinant _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ revealed redox dependence of their proteolytic activity . the data provide new insights into the redox network of the chloroplast .
the first part of the experimental work aimed at identifying novel targets for thiol disulphide transitions in the chloroplast . to this end the intact chloroplasts were fractionated . in addition to the proteomics approaches it appeared necessary to deplete the stromal fractions from the superabundant rubisco protein that usually represents of the chloroplast protein . after fractionation of the chloroplast proteins into two _PROTEIN_ subfractions stroma and _LOCATION_ and envelope _LOCATION_ the stromal proteins were further fractionated by chromatography to _PROTEIN_ the rubisco content . the elution profile of the proteins was monitored with a uv detector and the fractions were analysed by _PROTEIN_ . the most abundant protein is also one of the largest enzymes with a molecular _METHOD_ of about kda composed of eight large and eight small subunits . the buffer used for chromatography _PROTEIN_ the quaternary structure of the rubisco that eluted in the first fraction . under the denaturing conditions of _PROTEIN_ the subunits dissociated and separated as small and large subunits . as judged from gel scan analysis of summed small and large subunit amounts the rubisco content _PROTEIN_ from in the first to a level below detection limit in the fifth fraction . the depletion was confirmed by western blotting . the depletion from rubisco caused a change in the overall protein pattern by increasing the ratio of low abundant proteins in the fraction . the fraction containing the _LOCATION_ and envelope _LOCATION_ were further fractionated first into _LOCATION_ and luminal proteins and further into integral and peripheral proteins . the fractionation strategy was employed to _PROTEIN_ the number of the protein spots on the gel to overcome the problem of the limited separation on diagonal gels . because pure fractions were not required the analysis of fraction purity was not conducted . the diagonal redox _PROTEIN_ of the different subfractions revealed a large number of polypeptide spots below and above the diagonal across the gel . proteins with intramolecular disulphide bridges often migrate faster in the oxidized form and separate above the diagonal while polypeptides linked through intermolecular disulphide bridges separate under reducing conditions and as individualized polypeptides run faster in the second dimension . proteins without conformational changes show identical electrophoretic mobility in the first and second dimension and form the predominant diagonal band . the application of ia and the resultant _PROTEIN_ of the thiol groups after the treatment itself arrested the thiol disulphide status of the proteins and prevented oxidation of free thiols during _PROTEIN_ gel electrophoresis . the second ia treatment after the full reduction of the proteins prior to the second dimension suppressed of the newly formed cysteines . because of low protein amount not all spots could be addressed by _METHOD_ spectrometric analysis . however among the identified polypeptides were verified as proteins located in the chloroplast being associated with its subproteomes and subjected to further analysis . a total of of these proteins have one or more cysteinyl residue in their amino acid sequence . the majority of these proteins separated above the diagonal compared with below the diagonal while were found on both sides of the diagonal . their function will partly be addressed in the discussion . with almost half the proteins have not been described as being redox regulated or as representing thioredoxin or glutaredoxin targets before . to validate the approach and to verify the function of one of the novel proteins the _PROTEIN_ protease was selected for further studies . the _LOCATION_ deg proteases are encoded by two _LOCATION_ isogenes . both proteases were heterologously _PROTEIN_ in e. coli cells purified through affinity chromatography and their purity verified through _PROTEIN_ . surprisingly doublet bands were observed in both fractions with a small size difference of about kda . both bands were subjected to _METHOD_ spectrometric analysis and confirmed as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteases respectively . the detected peptides completely covered the corresponding mature protein sequence showing that the smaller band is not a truncated version . the activities of the heterologously _PROTEIN_ proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ under different redox milieus were measured with two different methods . a zymogram is a technique to analyse enzyme activity the method employed in our study makes use of the substrate casein in the gel . the position of the active enzyme is indicated by _PROTEIN_ casein amounts and thus by a clear zone after staining and partial destaining with _METHOD_ brilliant blue . _PROTEIN_ exhibited significant substrate specificity towards casein rather than gelatine . activity was maximal at ph . as cofactor turned out to be optimal . interestingly at optimal ph also supported the activity . the heterologously _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ captured two different conformations . the transition was redox dependent because the ratio of the upper to the lower band shifted with more negative redox potential towards the lower band . the impact of the conformational change on the structure of _PROTEIN_ got even more obvious with the western blot analysis . the his tag probably became hidden in the structure and was not detectable with the specific antibody against the his tag . the lower band turned out to be the active conformation as revealed by white bands in the zymogram with and without ia treatment after redox state adjustment . _PROTEIN_ formed oligomeric complexes under oxidizing conditions possibly a trimer . _PROTEIN_ showed no activity in the zymogram assay possibly because of an irreversible inactivation by _PROTEIN_ . the enzcheck protease assay was performed to quantitatively evaluate the activity . this technique is based on casein heavily labelled with the green _METHOD_ fl . the _METHOD_ of the substrate is quenched unless the substrate is digested by proteases . the increase in _METHOD_ is proportional to the activity of the protease . in this assay both proteases were active but showed a different behaviour . under reducing conditions the activity of _PROTEIN_ was maximal and _PROTEIN_ under oxidizing conditions to and after mm and mm treatment respectively supporting the results obtained from the zymogram . for _PROTEIN_ the opposite reaction could be observed with an increased activity under oxidizing conditions to and . because the sample was dialysed after the dtt and ia treatment the increase of the activity observed for _PROTEIN_ is not explained by enhanced unfolding of the substrate casein .
