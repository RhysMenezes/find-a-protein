in plants it is unclear how dispersed cortical microtubules are nucleated _PROTEIN_ and organized in the absence of centrosomes . in arabidopsis thaliana cells _PROTEIN_ of a fusion between the microtubule end binding protein _PROTEIN_ and green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ results in labelling of spindle poles where minus ends gather . during interphase _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labels the microtubule plus end as a comet but also marks the minus end as a site from which microtubules can grow and shrink . these minus end nucleation sites are mobile explaining how the cortical array can redistribute during the cell cycle and supporting the idea of a flexible centrosome in plants .
in plants microtubules do not radiate from a discrete organizing centre such as the centrosome in animal cells but are instead dispersed beneath the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . during cell expansion they are known to be remodelled into parallel groups of overlapping tubules that are organized transversely around the cell . the lack of a centrosome has led to much debate about this re organization and how all four microtubule arrays are formed . the _LOCATION_ surface actively supports outgrowth of microtubules but observation of living cells suggests that microtubules can also be directly nucleated at the cortex . mazia hypothesized that relocation of microtubule nucleating material around the plant cell cycle could be explained by a flexible centrosome in which the nucleating material is not anchored to centrioles but is free to assume various morphologies and locations . the problem has been in identifying the dispersed nucleating material . in theory tubulin should be a good minus end marker . however it is located along the length of plant microtubules both in vitro and in vivo . to label microtubule ends we _PROTEIN_ an arabidopsis homologue of the animal microtubule end binding protein as a _METHOD_ fusion protein . has higher affinity for the polymerizing plus end and lower affinity for binding along the wall forming a comet like gradient of staining on growing microtubules . these comets are known to label microtubule plus ends from vertebrate cells to fungi . here we demonstrate that it also marks plus ends in plants . functions as an 'antipause _PROTEIN_ at microtubule plus ends regulating microtubule dynamics and promoting end on attachment to different cellular sites . it is well established that is also located at the opposite ends of microtubules in fungi flies and vertebrates and so it is clearly not an exclusive marker of plus ends . indeed in dictyostelium discoideum is an integral component of the centrosome where its location is independent of microtubules . experiments have shown that its function at the centrosome is not essential for microtubule nucleation per se but that it may anchor microtubules or function as a source for distributing to the outgrowing plus ends . here we show that despite the absence of centrioles _METHOD_ foci at regions where the minus ends of microtubules are gathered during mitosis and early cytokinesis . during interphase _PROTEIN_ is located as small dispersed foci in the cell cortex that are easily distinguishable from the plus end comets on the basis of their slower dynamics and association with microtubule minus ends . we show that these foci are highly dynamic structures that move independently of microtubules and that microtubules shrink back to and grow out from them . this behaviour demonstrates how microtubule arrays can be remodelled during _PROTEIN_ cell growth and the cell cycle providing direct evidence for the concept of a flexible centrosome . first we searched the tair database for like genes . the arabidopsis genome contains three predicted genes that encode proteins with a high degree of similarity to human _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were and identical respectively with calculated relative molecular _METHOD_ of and . sequence analysis of the three arabidopsis proteins showed that similar to all family members they contained a highly conserved amino terminal domain required for microtubule binding and a highly conserved coiled coil domain thought to mediate protein protein interactions . cdnas for the three arabidopsis members were isolated by rt pcr and tagged at the _PROTEIN_ terminus with _METHOD_ . only the labelling pattern of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is presented here . transient _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in arabidopsis suspension cells confirmed that _PROTEIN_ associates with microtubules in vivo . labelling was either continuous along the microtubule or found in linear punctate patterns with the ends often labelled as dots . variation in labelling pattern is unlikely to be caused by _PROTEIN_ levels as the same cell often contained both types of labelling . in addition we observed none of the conspicuous bundling reported after _PROTEIN_ in animal cells . the linear punctate pattern is consistent with observations from xenopus laevis egg extracts in which was found to label plus end foci as well as the tubule wall the balance of which was controlled by the stage of the cell cycle . to confirm that these patterns were based on microtubules we treated protoplasts with the microtubule stabilizing drug taxol . this resulted in colocalization of microtubule and _METHOD_ signals . conversely the anti microtubule herbicide oryzalin reduced the _METHOD_ signal and its ability to form linear patterns leaving _METHOD_ foci in the cell cortex . time lapse microscopy observations of living suspension cells showed that similarly to animal cells _PROTEIN_ was concentrated at the fast growing ends of microtubules where it formed a comet like gradient of _METHOD_ intensity at the tips . this was particularly evident in cells with punctate labelling patterns where there was little tubule wall labelling . comets originated from multiple sites and moved unidirectionally in the cell cortex before disappearing abruptly . kymographs showed that these microtubules exhibited sustained polymerization that is growth without catastrophe or pause . compared with the dynamics observed in some other cells the polymerization rate in cells with comets was high averaging . dynamic instability could be observed in microtubules labelled with _PROTEIN_ on tubule walls . kymographs showed that _PROTEIN_ was relatively concentrated at the growing ends of microtubules . the intense plus end labelling observed in the polymerizing phase of the kymograph was lost after depolymerization . although dimmer than during the growing phase _PROTEIN_ was still detected at the plus end of a depolymerizing microtubule . the rates of polymerization and depolymerization were and respectively . microtubules also exhibited pause/attenuation . the average frequencies of catastrophe and rescue were and events per second respectively . these rates of microtubule growth and shrinkage are very similar to those reported for arabidopsis epidermal cells . however the depolymerization rate is almost four times slower than reported for tobacco suspension cells labelled with vertebrate clip . under the conditions we used microtubule plus ends spent of their time growing of their time depolymerizing and in a paused/attenuated state . microtubule plus ends spent times longer polymerizing than depolymerizing . the dynamicity value of compares favourably with plus end values obtained from interphase animal cells . labelling with _PROTEIN_ revealed three other types of dynamic behaviour . pulling was observed when the plus end of a depolymerizing microtubule attached to the flank of another tubule . a characteristic of this type of behaviour was a reduction in the rate of microtubule disassembly from to once it had attached to the other microtubule and begun pulling on it . has been shown to interact with motor proteins in other cell types and it is conceivable that pulling can be explained by a motor protein at the plus ends of microtubules which couples microtubule movement to microtubule disassembly similarly to the way the kinetochore motor cenp e couples chromatid movement to microtubule depolymerization . conversely the plus ends of polymerizing microtubules were observed to push microtubules at the cortex . the third behaviour sliding would be difficult to detect within a microtubule bundle but was viewed when microtubules cross each other 's paths at an angle . in such cases microtubules slid with an average velocity of . these movements demonstrate the spatial freedom associated with acentriolar plant microtubules adding to the repertoire by which cortical microtubules can re orientate between transverse oblique and longitudinally orientated arrays . hook decoration studies have established the _PROTEIN_ of microtubules in the spindle and phragmoplast but the _PROTEIN_ of cortical microtubules remains unknown . the plus end revealing behaviour of _PROTEIN_ comets allowed us to examine the _PROTEIN_ of microtubule growth in elongated suspension cells . we conclude that first microtubules originate from multiple sites that are diffusely distributed at the cortex second they grow both clockwise and anti clockwise within the same cell third they grow in varying directions _PROTEIN_ . thus at least in suspension cells there is no evidence that the array as a whole must contain microtubules growing in the same direction for cell elongation to be _PROTEIN_ . consistent with animal studies _PROTEIN_ was found at the spindle poles of plant cells . despite the absence of centrioles _PROTEIN_ was still capable of forming _PROTEIN_ foci reminiscent of the centrosomes found at the poles of animal spindles . _PROTEIN_ labelling was also observed during early telophase where _PROTEIN_ surrounded the daughter _LOCATION_ but concentrated at their inner faces . at this stage of cytokinesis the two sets of phragmoplast microtubules were associated with the daughter _LOCATION_ a stage at which the minus ends are known to be directed towards the chromosomal _METHOD_ . therefore _PROTEIN_ accumulates near microtubule minus ends during mitosis and early cytokinesis . this association of _PROTEIN_ with material at the minus ends of microtubules during division was reflected in the labelling pattern during interphase . separate from the comet like labelling _PROTEIN_ was found at foci that did not demonstrate plus end dynamics . such foci were diffusely distributed at the cell cortex often associated with microtubule bundles and at the minus ends of mobile microtubules . time lapse microscopy indicated that these foci function as microtubule nucleation sites . fig . shows stills from a movie illustrating a microtubule growing from an _PROTEIN_ focus . fig . demonstrates a microtubule depolymerizing back to such a focus . when microtubules depolymerized the foci often remained in the same superficial focal plane as the cortical microtubules and so the foci are presumed to be attached to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . however the association was dynamic as foci were capable of appearing and disappearing from the cortex . an example of mobility is shown in fig . where a microtubule depolymerizes back to a focus that then moves to another position giving rise to another microtubule . this suggests that _PROTEIN_ labels foci from which cortical microtubules originate and that these foci are mobile capable of associating with and dissociating from the cortex . another form of mobility was detected in which the focus of _PROTEIN_ was attached to the minus end of a microtubule resulting a dumbbell like structure with foci at either end . importantly these ends are readily distinguishable by the fast polymerization rate of the comet end . by tracking the minus end foci it was possible to show that they exhibited slow but sustained plus end directed movement as they moved in the wake of a growing microtubule . not all cortical microtubules were motile some _PROTEIN_ fixed positions . as previously shown by photobleaching the movement of motile microtubules is most probably caused by a modified form of treadmilling rather than translocation of a non dynamic minus end . these are not inactive mobile sites dragged along by a treadmilling microtubule . fig . illustrates an active _PROTEIN_ focus at the minus end of a dynamic microtubule marking the outgrowth of a second microtubule . faster movement of the minus end has been observed with a maximum of resulting in complete and rapid depolymerization of the microtubule . however where minus end foci can be clearly monitored it is important to note that movement is slower . this suggests that the presence of the nucleation site protects the microtubule minus end from rapid depolymerization . in animal cells for instance microtubules detached from centrosomes have free minus ends that are unstable . therefore relocation of _PROTEIN_ which we have shown throughout the cell cycle could account for the destabilization of arrays on a cyclic basis . in conclusion these data demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ locates both to the plus ends of microtubules and to the sites of nucleation during division and interphase . such comet like as well as centrosomal labelling is well documented in animals and fungi underlining the evolutionary conservation of function . by analogy with function in other eukaryotes and bearing in _PROTEIN_ that knockdown experiments do not suggest a role in nucleation per se we hypothesize that _PROTEIN_ may be involved in anchoring microtubules to their nucleation sites and/or functioning as a reservoir for distribution to the growing end . in any case by marking the nucleation sites in interphase _PROTEIN_ has provided new information on the genesis of the dispersed cortical array . by moving with cortical microtubules and by translocating independently of microtubule growth the _PROTEIN_ tagged nucleation sites offer a way by which a dispersed centrosome equivalent can extend the cortical array during the _METHOD_ expansion that is characteristic of vacuolated plant cells . the data support the idea that nucleation sites are recycled . however our findings show that microtubule minus ends are not necessarily severed from the nucleation site and transported to the plus end of a microtubule as part of the recycling process . these observations provide direct evidence for mazia 's long standing hypothesis of the plant cell 's 'flexible centrosome in which nucleating material disperses at different stages of the cell cycle .
