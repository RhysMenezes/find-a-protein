dead box rna helicases are involved in many aspects of rna metabolism and in diverse biological processes in plants . arabidopsis thaliana mutants of two dead box rna helicases _PROTEIN_ response _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were previously shown to exhibit tolerance to abiotic stresses and up regulated stress responsive gene _PROTEIN_ . here we show that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines displayed a less tolerant phenotype and reduced _PROTEIN_ of stress induced genes confirming the _PROTEIN_ as attenuators of arabidopsis stress responses . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins exhibited localization to the nucleolus nucleoplasm and chromocenters and exhibited relocalization in response to abscisic acid treatment and various stresses . this relocalization was reversed when stress treatments were removed . the _PROTEIN_ proteins displayed mis localization in specific gene silencing mutants and exhibited rna dependent _PROTEIN_ and rna unwinding activities . in particular _PROTEIN_ showed mis localization in three out of four mutants of the rna directed dna methylation pathway while _PROTEIN_ was mis localized in the _PROTEIN_ mutant that is defective in histone deacetylase activity . furthermore heterochromatic rddm target loci displayed reduced dna methylation and increased _PROTEIN_ in the strs mutants . taken together our findings suggest that the _PROTEIN_ proteins are involved in epigenetic silencing of gene _PROTEIN_ to bring about suppression of the arabidopsis stress response .
we generated transgenic lines that overexpressed _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of the camv promoter in the strs mutant background to further strengthen the contention that the _PROTEIN_ are negative regulators of stress responses . at least four homozygous transgenic lines that _PROTEIN_ a single copy of either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ were assessed by real time polymerase chain reaction for the level of _PROTEIN_ overexpression . all transgenic lines exhibited higher _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ genes compared with wild type plants . we selected the _PROTEIN_ ox line and the _PROTEIN_ ox line for further study because both lines displayed persistent overexpression under salt stress . because the strs mutants are tolerant to stress we expected that the _PROTEIN_ ox lines would display reduced tolerance . the germination rate of wt and mutant lines under stress was compared with the respective germination rate under control conditions . figure shows that seeds of both _PROTEIN_ ox lines indeed exhibited a greater salt stress mediated reduction in germination than wt . seeds of the _PROTEIN_ ox lines were also less tolerant than wt seeds to heat stress during germination . accordingly a h heat stress treatment of led to a and reduction in germination index of _PROTEIN_ ox and _PROTEIN_ ox lines respectively whereas the wt germination index only fell by . the strs mutants have been previously shown to display up regulated _PROTEIN_ of stress responsive genes that encode transcriptional activators . although the _PROTEIN_ of the transcription _PROTEIN_ genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the dreb/cbf target gene _PROTEIN_ was induced by salt stress in all plant lines examined in _PROTEIN_ ox plants induction of gene _PROTEIN_ was reduced significantly compared with wt peak gene _PROTEIN_ at h in the _PROTEIN_ ox lines was only about of wt . _PROTEIN_ of the housekeeping gene _PROTEIN_ was unaffected by stress treatments in _PROTEIN_ ox or wt plants a finding that suggests a specific role for the _PROTEIN_ proteins in regulating stress induced gene _PROTEIN_ . similarly heat induced _PROTEIN_ of genes that encode heat shock proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was specifically reduced in the _PROTEIN_ ox lines . taken together our results reaffirm our hypothesis that the _PROTEIN_ proteins function as negative regulators of the arabidopsis response to multiple abiotic stresses . in order to examine organ specific _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ we generated transgenic arabidopsis plants that _PROTEIN_ the uida reporter gene under the control of _PROTEIN_ upstream dna . the _PROTEIN_ promoters are unusually small so plants were produced that _PROTEIN_ gus under the control of or bp _PROTEIN_ and or bp _PROTEIN_ upstream dna . several independent lines of homozygous single copy uida and uida plants were stained histochemically for gus activity . no gus staining could be detected in any organ of the prostrs uida lines except in pollen grains . the promoterless gus line showed no staining of any part of the plant this result suggested that gus staining in the anthers was specific to the putative _PROTEIN_ promoters . the observed prostrs uida _PROTEIN_ did not agree with previous qpcr analysis showing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in leaves roots _METHOD_ and inflorescences . several arabidopsis dead box rna helicases require both the promoter region and elements within the gene body for proper _PROTEIN_ . in arabidopsis wt plants that _PROTEIN_ full length genomic _PROTEIN_ uida fusions and driven by native _PROTEIN_ upstream dna fragments gus activity could be observed in all organs examined while constitutively high gus _PROTEIN_ was observed in a procamv uida line . these findings thus confirm previous qpcr results and indicate that a regulatory element within the _PROTEIN_ transcribed region is required for proper organ specific _PROTEIN_ . inspection of the speckled prostrs gstrs uida staining pattern suggested sub cellular _PROTEIN_ localization in the _LOCATION_ . we therefore generated transgenic arabidopsis plants that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in a wt background . at least four homozygous single copy lines were produced and two lines that exhibited constitutive overexpression under control and salt stress conditions of either _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ rna and protein were selected for further study . notably the _PROTEIN_ proteins were still functional when fused to green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ as demonstrated by reduced tolerance of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seeds during germination under either salt or heat stress similar to that of the _PROTEIN_ ox lines . figure shows that the _METHOD_ signal in protoplasts transformed with the respective _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plasmids was localized to the nucleolus with a weaker signal in the nucleoplasm . when _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ alone it was observed all over the protoplast thereby confirming that the nucleolar/nucleoplasmic localized _METHOD_ signal was due to fusion with the _PROTEIN_ proteins . protoplasts that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were also stained with diamidino phenylindole which stains the _LOCATION_ blue but does not stain the nucleolus . no overlap of dapi staining and _METHOD_ signal was observed supporting nucleolar _PROTEIN_ localization . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants exhibited the same nucleolar/nucleoplasmic _PROTEIN_ localization . finally co localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins with the nucleolar marker protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fused to red _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ confirmed _PROTEIN_ nucleolar localization . it is well accepted that use of the promoter for _METHOD_ localization studies does not affect protein localization . nevertheless we employed the knowledge gained from our gus studies which showed that an element in the _PROTEIN_ transcribed region is required for proper regulation of _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ to generate a _METHOD_ construct . transient _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts demonstrated the same nucleolar/nucleoplasmic localization as the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct . the nucleolus is highly dynamic and there is a continuous exchange of nucleolar proteins with the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm . to examine whether the _PROTEIN_ also exhibit relocalization from the nucleolus in response to stress day old _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings were transferred from murashige and skoog _METHOD_ medium to fresh _METHOD_ medium that was supplemented with mm nacl . approximately min after transfer _METHOD_ was no longer observed in the nucleolus and was distributed uniformly throughout the nucleoplasm . however no relocalization of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signal was observed when seedlings were transferred from _METHOD_ control plates to fresh _METHOD_ control plates this result confirmed that nucleolar nucleoplasmic relocalization had occurred in response to salt stress . salt stress mediated co localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with nucleoplasmic localized _METHOD_ and dapi stained _LOCATION_ provided further confirmation of salt stress mediated _PROTEIN_ relocalization to the nucleoplasm . to capture the kinetics of _PROTEIN_ relocalization day old _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings were transferred from control _METHOD_ plates to a coverslip chamber which was flushed with either liquid _METHOD_ or liquid _METHOD_ supplemented with mm nacl . relocalization of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal could be observed within min after application of salt stress and indicated rapid _PROTEIN_ relocalization from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm . re flushing with fresh liquid _METHOD_ led to a gradual recovery to the nucleolus . accordingly min after re flushing the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signal re localized into nucleoplasmic speckles . no recovery of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ into the nucleolus was observed at this time although some recovery of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ could be seen . by min after re flushing both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signals could be seen in the nucleolus in addition to nucleoplasmic speckles . these speckles disappeared gradually over the next min until by min the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signals resembled the control cells . continuous salt stress for h did not lead to reappearance of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signal in the nucleolus this finding demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ relocalization back from the nucleoplasm to the nucleolus is part of the recovery process from stress . notably fibrillarin a component of a nucleolar small _LOCATION_ ribonucleoprotein remained in the nucleolus in both unstressed and salt stressed seedlings this finding excluded the possibility of a stress induced breakup of the nucleolus and affirmed that relocalization is an inherent feature of _PROTEIN_ proteins . furthermore the fast nucleolar nucleoplasmic shuttling suggested that the _PROTEIN_ proteins are loosely bound at nucleolar sites . this suggestion was confirmed by _METHOD_ recovery after photobleaching assays which showed that the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signal in the nucleolus recovered to about of its pre bleached level in about sec . nucleolar nucleoplasmic _PROTEIN_ relocalization was also induced following aba application osmotic stress and exposure to heat . however whereas salt stress caused relocalization to the nucleoplasm within min relocalization took approximately min in response to aba and osmotic stress and min in response to heat stress . furthermore the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signal re localized transiently to a few chromosomal sites that were likely to be chromocenters in response to aba or osmotic stress . re flushing with fresh liquid _METHOD_ led to localization of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein back to the nucleolus at approximately or min after aba osmotic stress or heat stress respectively no nucleoplasmic speckles were observed as was seen after recovery from salt stress . inspection of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the nucleoplasm indicated that the _PROTEIN_ may also be localized to chromocenters intense dapi stained regions of heterochromatic dna that are generally transcriptionally inactive . chromocentric _PROTEIN_ localization was confirmed by immunolabeling using anti _METHOD_ against _LOCATION_ isolated from unstressed wt and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants followed by fish with fluorescein dutp labeled centromeric bp repeats _PROTEIN_ . figures and show that the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ proteins co localized with _PROTEIN_ repeats as well as with the nucleolus . however no chromocenter associated _METHOD_ signal was observed in _LOCATION_ of plants that had been subjected to h of salt stress . it is unlikely that this result was due to stress mediated break down of the chromocenters because the _PROTEIN_ signal was clearly visible in _LOCATION_ from stressed wt and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants . however the _METHOD_ signal accumulated in the nucleolar rim suggesting possible relocalization from the chromocenters to this sub _LOCATION_ region . the chromocentric _PROTEIN_ localization suggested that the _PROTEIN_ may be involved in gene silencing a notion that would be consistent with their role as negative regulators of gene _PROTEIN_ and their stress mediated relocalization out of the chromocenters . to test this hypothesis we obtained arabidopsis mutant plants that are defective in genes selected in accordance with their similar localization pattern to the _PROTEIN_ their involvement in gene silencing mutant plants that exhibited increased/reduced stress tolerance or displayed a high co _PROTEIN_ correlation coefficient with the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . protoplasts from each mutant were transformed with the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ constructs to determine whether any of the mutations led to aberrant _PROTEIN_ localization . details of the various mutants examined are provided in table . _PROTEIN_ exhibited perturbed localization in three mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ that are part of the rna directed dna methylation gene silencing mechanism at repetitive heterochromatic loci . _PROTEIN_ localization was also perturbed in a mutant of the _PROTEIN_ gene that is involved in _PROTEIN_ of histone methylation and may also be linked to rddm . finally aberrant _PROTEIN_ localization was observed in a mutant of the _PROTEIN_ gene that has a role in methylation induced gene silencing in euchromatin . _PROTEIN_ exhibited wt localization in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants but displayed perturbed localization in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . _PROTEIN_ is a histone deacetylase that is involved in aba and salt stress responses and that interacts with _PROTEIN_ a histone deacetylase functioning in heterochromatic dna silencing . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ exhibited aberrant localization in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . _PROTEIN_ displays nucleolar and cajal body localization and may be involved in small ribonucleoprotein splicing functions . however whereas _PROTEIN_ localized to _LOCATION_ bodies in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ exhibited uniform nucleoplasmic localization . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ localization was also perturbed in a mutant of _GENE_ that encoded an ribosomal protein . in mutants of _PROTEIN_ iii and the sdc mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ both _PROTEIN_ displayed wt localization . to assess whether the _PROTEIN_ function in gene silencing we compared transcript levels of the and transposons and the intergenic repeat sequence solo ltr in wt and the strs mutants as a measure of rddm mediated transcriptional silencing of these heterochromatic loci . figure shows that and solo ltr exhibited increased _PROTEIN_ in the strs mutants compared with wt which indicated de repression of these loci . _PROTEIN_ only displayed up regulation in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . furthermore digestion of genomic dna with the methylation sensitive haeiii restriction enzyme followed by pcr amplification with primers specific for demonstrated reduced dna methylation at this locus in the strs mutants . methylation was particularly reduced in _PROTEIN_ this result was consistent with greater de repression of transcriptional silencing in this mutant . overall the results support our contention that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may both play a role in rddm mediated gene silencing . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ possess all the conserved motifs of dead box rna helicases which have been implicated in rna interference pathways . to determine whether these proteins possess intrinsic rna dependent _PROTEIN_ activity purified his tagged _PROTEIN_ proteins were employed in a coupled spectrophotometric assay . in the absence of rna and _PROTEIN_ protein or with rna alone only a slight reduction in _PROTEIN_ activity was observed while the _PROTEIN_ in absorbance was higher when both rna and _PROTEIN_ protein were included in the reaction . thus both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ possess an rna dependent _PROTEIN_ activity . to examine whether the _PROTEIN_ exhibit rna unwinding activity the ability of purified his tagged _PROTEIN_ protein to unwind a _METHOD_ labeled synthetic rna duplex was examined . the appearance of single stranded rna and the concomitant disappearance of the mer rna duplex demonstrated that the _PROTEIN_ indeed possess an _PROTEIN_ dependent rna unwinding activity . this activity was not the result of contaminating e. coli protein . only of _PROTEIN_ protein was required to dissociate fully the rna duplex in min whereas _PROTEIN_ protein could not complete unwinding by min this finding suggested that _PROTEIN_ may possess higher helicase activity than _PROTEIN_ . we also showed that purified _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ proteins retained rna unwinding activity thereby providing further confirmation that the _METHOD_ tag does not impede _PROTEIN_ function . collectively our results establish the _PROTEIN_ as bona fide rna helicases .
