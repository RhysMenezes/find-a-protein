geranylgeranyl diphosphate is a key precursor of various isoprenoids that have diverse functions in plant metabolism and development . the annotation of the arabidopsis thaliana genome predicts genes to encode geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthases . in this study we analyzed ggpps activity as well as the subcellular localization and tissue specific _PROTEIN_ of the entire protein family in a. thaliana . and _PROTEIN_ showed ggpps activity in escherichia coli similar to activities reported earlier for and citation plant mol biol citation . did not produce ggpp in e. coli . based on dna sequence analysis we propose that is a pseudogene . ggpps _METHOD_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins of the ten functional ggpp synthases localized to _LOCATION_ mitochondria and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ with the majority of the enzymes located in _LOCATION_ . gene _PROTEIN_ analysis using quantitative real time pcr ggpps promoter gus _PROTEIN_ assays and publicly available microarray data revealed a differential spatio temporal _PROTEIN_ of ggpps genes . the results suggest that _LOCATION_ and mitochondria are key subcellular compartments for the synthesis of ubiquitous ggpp derived isoprenoid species . _PROTEIN_ and are the major isozymes responsible for their biosynthesis . all remaining paralogs encoding six _LOCATION_ isozymes and two _LOCATION_ isozymes were _PROTEIN_ in specific tissues and/or at specific developmental stages suggesting their role in developmentally regulated isoprenoid biosynthesis . our results show that of the predicted ggpps encoded in the a. thaliana genome are functional proteins that can synthesize ggpp . their specific subcellular location and differential _PROTEIN_ pattern suggest subfunctionalization in providing ggpp to specific tissues developmental stages or metabolic pathways .
using homology searches lange and ghassemian predicted twelve ggpps paralogs in the a. thaliana genome with having the weakest similarity to the other members of the protein family . with the discovery of a novel class of prenyl diphosphate synthase genes the gpp synthase small subunit _PROTEIN_ ii subfamily was reclassified as a member of this protein class . _PROTEIN_ are highly similar to ggpp synthases at the amino acid level but they lack two aspartate rich motifs dd d that are important in prenyl substrate binding rendering them inactive . in addition they have two cxxxc motifs that are important in physical interactions between the two subunits . we compared the amino acid sequences of functionally non characterized ggpp synthases with their active counterparts and with the . all ggpp synthases except have two dd d motifs and lack the second cxxxc motif suggesting that they are functional proteins . in addition other amino acids flanking the dd d motifs are important for prenyl substrate binding . these amino acids are also conserved in all ggpp synthases except . we used targetp and psort to identify putative subcellular localization domains in the ggpp synthases whose localization has not been reported . based on the in silico predictions and localize to _LOCATION_ either to mitochondria or to the _LOCATION_ and to mitochondria . inspection of the multiple sequence alignment revealed a shorter protein sequence for compared to its closest paralogs and . whereas is amino acids long and are both amino acids long and contain a _LOCATION_ targeting sequence at the n terminus . the dna sequences currently existing in the database for and were examined in more detail . compared to and has an insertion of four nucleotides _PROTEIN_ that causes a frame shift if translation is initiated from the _PROTEIN_ homologous to the and translation initiation codons resulting in a truncated protein sequence . therefore another _PROTEIN_ codon was selected by tair as the translation initiation start . this _PROTEIN_ codon is present in all homologous sequences indicating that it is not specific for . this _PROTEIN_ is also not preceded by typical translation initiation sequences such as the kozak consensus sequence gccrccaugg or the a. thaliana specific consensus sequence for aug context aa aauggcg . additionally no cdna is present in genbank for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ that would support the proposed gene model . we therefore consider a pseudogene and did not include it in our further analysis . based on dna sequence analysis we predict that the a. thaliana genome encodes ten functional ggpp synthases . both in vitro enzymatic assays and genetic complementation of e. coli are methods that are widely used to characterize functionality of ggpps . crude extracts or purified proteins from e. coli cultures _PROTEIN_ heterologous ggpp synthases were used for enzymatic reactions with ipp and an allylic substrate _METHOD_ . under these conditions and _PROTEIN_ synthesized ggpp but only a compound longer than _PROTEIN_ . did not produce any prenyl diphosphate . the ggpps activity of and was tested and confirmed by genetic complementation of e. coli . spectrum and length of prenyl _PROTEIN_ synthesized by prenyl transferases in vitro can be greatly affected by the type and concentration of the used substrate and by the ex vivo experimental conditions . we therefore used genetic complementation of e. coli to examine the activity of the uncharacterized a. thaliana ggpp synthases . all enzymes tested previously only in in vitro conditions were analyzed as well . the crte gene encoding ggpps from the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ lycopene biosynthesis gene cluster present in the paccrt _PROTEIN_ vector was mutated to generate plasmid paccrt bi . after e. coli cells are transformed with paccrt bi they only synthesize minor amounts of lycopene due to residual ggpp levels in the bacteria . lycopene production is increased after co transformation with another plasmid harboring a protein with ggpps activity . all putative ggpp synthases except and were cloned into pgex vectors after removal of the signal peptides from the n termini to improve the solubility of the recombinant proteins . as expected e. coli cells carrying the paccrt bi vector and the empty vector pgex produced very little pigment . in contrast e. coli co transformed with the paccrt bi vector containing the genes for the individual a. thaliana putative ggpp synthases formed red colored colonies except cells transformed with the pgex vector carrying . pigments were extracted from bacterial liquid cultures and quantified by measuring the absorbance of the extracts at nm . vectors containing and _PROTEIN_ highly increased lycopene production in e. coli cells harboring paccrt bi establishing that the genes encode active ggpp synthases . the absorbance of extracts from e. coli cells _PROTEIN_ and was not as strong but still significantly higher than the vector control suggesting that they can also produce ggpp . only was found to lack ggpp synthase activity confirming in vitro activity assays . together a. thaliana and are functional ggpp synthases and most likely functions as a _PROTEIN_ small subunit . the subcellular localization of and _PROTEIN_ has already been determined using transit peptide _METHOD_ fusion proteins in tobacco by cells . was shown to localize to the mitochondria and to the _LOCATION_ and and _PROTEIN_ to _LOCATION_ . the localization of and _PROTEIN_ to _LOCATION_ was also demonstrated by in vitro import into pea chloroplasts and _PROTEIN_ was detected in the stroma in chloroplast proteomics studies . all remaining functional ggpp synthases were predicted to have an n terminal transit peptide for _LOCATION_ localization except of that was predicted to localize to the _LOCATION_ or mitochondria . we fused _METHOD_ to the c terminus of the full length ggpps proteins to determine the subcellular localization of the entire protein family . figure b show that the _METHOD_ signal exhibited a punctuate pattern of a size shape and distribution that overlapped with the mcherry mitochondrial marker but not with chlorophyll _METHOD_ . is therefore a mitochondrial isozyme supporting earlier results obtained using a transit peptide _METHOD_ fusion protein . both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ signals formed a filamentous structure that overlapped with the mcherry _LOCATION_ marker . and therefore localize to the _LOCATION_ consistent with transit peptide _METHOD_ fusions . the _METHOD_ signals of and _METHOD_ fusion proteins were localized to _LOCATION_ based on both chlorophyll _METHOD_ and overlap with the mcherry _LOCATION_ marker confirming _LOCATION_ localization of all remaining proteins . these results are consistent with in vivo data and in silico data except for which was predicted by targetp and psort to localize to either mitochondria or _LOCATION_ . to gain insight into the differential _PROTEIN_ of the ggpps gene family we first used quantitative real time pcr which allows the specific differential amplification of transcripts from highly similar genes . we analyzed the _PROTEIN_ of individual paralogs in seedlings and plant organs such as roots rosette and cauline leaves _METHOD_ flowers and siliques . _PROTEIN_ levels lower or equal to a cycle threshold value of were _PROTEIN_ as significant . the analysis revealed the distinct distribution and accumulation of the ggpps transcripts in the different organs and in seedlings . _PROTEIN_ had the highest _PROTEIN_ level compared to all other paralogs in all organs and in seedlings representing more than of the total ggpps transcripts in all organs except siliques flowers and roots . only encoding the mitochondrial ggpps and encoding a _LOCATION_ ggpps are also ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ in all organs and in seedlings although at much lower levels . although is _PROTEIN_ in all organs _PROTEIN_ was significantly more pronounced in siliques and roots . _PROTEIN_ of is confined to specific organs and developmental stages . in seedlings all ggpps genes except and were _PROTEIN_ . in plants _PROTEIN_ of the remaining ggpps genes was confined _PROTEIN_ to roots siliques and flowers . together the ggpps paralogs in a. thaliana have significantly different quantitative and tissue specific _PROTEIN_ patterns . to obtain more detailed information on the tissue specific _PROTEIN_ of the ggpps genes we introduced ggpps promoter gus fusion constructs into a. thaliana and analyzed the transformants using histochemical staining . since and _PROTEIN_ were already characterized we focused on the remaining ggpps genes . we also included a _PROTEIN_ gus promoter fusion because of the discrepancy between the reported gus data that indicated little promoter activity in roots and our gene _PROTEIN_ data shown in fig . . to clone ggpps promoters intergenic regions of a maximum of kb were amplified . the _PROTEIN_ promoter contained also part of the upstream gene sequence and was bp longer than the construct used by okada et al . . plants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ promoter gus fusions showed discernable blue staining while plants _PROTEIN_ and promoter gus fusions did not give any signal even when stained for more than h. the _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ gus ubiquitously in all seedling tissues and during all subsequent phases of plant development including the roots . thus the distal bp sequence of the promoter region present in our construct is required for _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the root . and promoters directed gus _PROTEIN_ specifically in the roots of both seedlings and adult plants . the promoter region of restricted transcription of gus in the root tip . the promoter was also active in the meristematic zone of the root tip particularly in the columella and the _PROTEIN_ root cap . _PROTEIN_ was detected specifically in the outer cell layers located above the mitotically active area of the root . although _PROTEIN_ of in flowers siliques and seedlings in roots and siliques and in all organs and seedlings was detected by rt qpcr albeit transcript levels were low no gus staining was visible in these tissues . a possible explanation for the discrepancy between the _PROTEIN_ detected by rt qpcr and promoter gus fusions can be either the lower sensitivity of gus detection assay compared to rt qpcr or the lack of regulatory sequences in the selected promoter regions . rt qpcr analysis of gene _PROTEIN_ showed that all or most of the ggpps paralogs are _PROTEIN_ in roots and reproductive organs respectively . since the tissue specific _PROTEIN_ detected by rt qpcr did not fully coincide with the ggpps promoter gus fusion data we used available microarray data sets for roots and seeds and extracted microarray data for flower tissues at developmental stages and from the arabidopsis development baseline dataset . before the analysis we confirmed that the microarray data were similar to the rt qpcr data using comparable organ samples and that probesets were specific to capture paralog specific _PROTEIN_ data . as shown on supplemental table rt qpcr and microarrays were comparable although the sensitivity of rt qpcr was higher as previously reported for other genes _PROTEIN_ at low levels . additional signals observed in microarrays in some organs can likely be attributed to the differences in sample material used by the two _METHOD_ . except for and specific probesets for all paralogs are present on the _PROTEIN_ microarray and their specificity is supported by unique _PROTEIN_ pattern for each of the paralogs . there is only one probeset that hybridizes to both and and data obtained from microarrays for this probeset reflect _PROTEIN_ of both paralogs . and _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ in all flower tissues further substantiating their ubiquitous _PROTEIN_ pattern . _PROTEIN_ of another ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ paralog was not detected on the microarrays in any of the flower tissues although its _PROTEIN_ was detected in flowers by rt qpcr . the reason for this discrepancy might be the lower sensitivity of microarrays to detect gene _PROTEIN_ . two additional paralogs and are _PROTEIN_ in flowers . is _PROTEIN_ at all flower developmental stages _PROTEIN_ in stamens whereas are _PROTEIN_ specifically in carpels at the _PROTEIN_ stages of flower development . the _PROTEIN_ paralog is the most abundantly _PROTEIN_ ggpps in all flower tissues except for that is the most highly _PROTEIN_ paralog in stamens at flower developmental stage . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in flowers and in anthers was also observed using promoter gus fusions of the respective genes . while all paralogs are _PROTEIN_ in developing seeds _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ most highly at all developmental stages and in all tissues . _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ at the highest level in the _PROTEIN_ endosperm at pre globular globular and heart stages . all remaining paralogs are _PROTEIN_ in several tissues but at significantly lower levels and _PROTEIN_ of each paralog peaks at different developmental stages . is _PROTEIN_ most highly in the suspensor at the globular stage in the seed coat at the linear cotyledon stage in the peripheral endosperm at mature green stage in the seed coat at mature green stage in the embryo proper at the heart stage in the _PROTEIN_ endosperm at pre globular stage in the _PROTEIN_ endosperm at the heart stage and in the _PROTEIN_ endosperm at the pre globular stage . all ggpps paralogs are also _PROTEIN_ in roots . while _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ ubiquitously at all developmental stages and in all root tissues except the procambium its peak _PROTEIN_ level is similar to that of . the other paralogs have diverse developmental and/or tissue specific _PROTEIN_ patterns . similarly to _PROTEIN_ the gene for the mitochondrial is _PROTEIN_ ubiquitously in all tissues but its _PROTEIN_ is the strongest in the elongation zone . is _PROTEIN_ predominantly in the endodermis in the cortex and to a lesser extent in vascular tissues . and which encode _LOCATION_ localized ggpp synthases are _PROTEIN_ in the procambium and in the epidermis in root hair cells . although and are _PROTEIN_ in the same tissues is confined to the elongation zone while is _PROTEIN_ in the meristematic and maturation zones . _PROTEIN_ in vascular tissues is also consistent with the promoter gus _PROTEIN_ data while _PROTEIN_ of was observed in the root tip using a promoter gus fusion construct . is _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in columella _PROTEIN_ root cap cortex epidermis and vascular tissues but not the procambium . is the paralog that shows the strongest _PROTEIN_ in root tissues . _PROTEIN_ in the columella and _PROTEIN_ root cap is likely resulting from while is _PROTEIN_ in the vasculature as suggested by and promoter gus _PROTEIN_ patterns . is _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the epidermis especially in the elongation zone and in the _PROTEIN_ root cap consistent with the promoter gus _PROTEIN_ pattern . is weakly _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the epidermis and phloem while is _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the procambium although its _PROTEIN_ was observed in the ground tissue using promoter gus fusion . together the _PROTEIN_ of most of the ggpps paralogs in a. thaliana has become significantly constrained by tissue and cell specific transcriptional regulation .
the a. thaliana accession was used in this study . plants were grown either on basic murashige skoog _METHOD_ medium containing w/v plant agar or on soil in a climate controlled growth chamber under long day conditions at . the crt cluster responsible for the synthesis of lycopene in _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ has been cloned and widely used for complementation assays in e. coli . the paccrt bi plasmid was constructed from paccrt _PROTEIN_ by introducing a frameshift in the bstxi site of the crte gene encoding ggpp synthase . after digestion of paccrt eib with bstxi the overhangs were filled with the klenow fragment of dna polymerase i to create blunt ends . after ligation and transformation with the resulting paccrt bi construct positive transformants were identified by their absence of pigmentation compared to those transformed with paccrt _PROTEIN_ in which a functional crte protein produces ggpp to further synthesize lycopene resulting in red colonies . pgex ggpps vectors were constructed via ligation of the pcr amplified ggpps sequences into the bamhi and noti sites of the protein _PROTEIN_ pgex vector . pcr was performed using pentr/d topo ggpps vectors as template and primers listed in the supplemental table . the resulting constructs consisted of the fusion between the glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ and truncated ggppss controlled by the tac promoter . all constructs were checked by sequencing . e. coli cells were co transformed with both pgex ggpps constructs and paccrt bi . transformants containing both constructs were selected on lb plates containing both ampicillin and chloramphenicol antibiotics . positive colonies were selected and grown overnight in liquid lb . the next day ml of fresh lb cultures supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics were inoculated grown for days at and harvested . ml were used for the lycopene extraction . in brief pelleted cells were broken by vortexing for s and of acetone were added . samples were vortexed for more seconds and then incubated in the dark at for min . the tubes were centrifuged for min at at rpm . supernatants were collected in glass spectrophotometer cuvettes and absorbance was measured at nm . coding sequences of a. thaliana genes for ggpps isozymes were amplified without their stop codon from total arabidopsis cdna and cloned into the gateway compatible pentr/d topo entry vector resulting in pentr/d topo ggpps vectors . constructs were checked by dna sequencing . lr reactions were then performed to clone these cdnas into the binary vector . the resulting constructs pggpps _METHOD_ consisted of the ggpps _METHOD_ fusions under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . constructs were introduced into agrobacterium tumefaciens koncz and shell citation and then into wild type arabidopsis plants via agrobacterium mediated floral dip transformation . primary transformants were selected on _METHOD_ medium supplemented with kanamycin . at least two stable lines per isozyme were selected for further experiments . these lines were subsequently transformed by floral dipping with mcherry organelle reporter constructs as follows _METHOD_ lines with the mitochondrial reporter construct _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ lines with the _LOCATION_ reporter construct and _METHOD_ with the _LOCATION_ reporter constructs . double transformants were selected by both kanamycin and basta antibiotic resistance . leaves of young seedlings were analyzed under a leica _PROTEIN_ confocal laser scanning microscope . _METHOD_ was excited at nm and its emission signal was collected between and nm . mcherry was excited at nm and its emission signal was collected between and nm . chlorophyll was excited at nm and its emission signal was collected between and nm . plant material was collected from seven different organs namely roots rosette leaves cauline leaves _METHOD_ flowers seedlings and siliques . the root samples were collected from day old seedlings grown on _METHOD_ medium . the rosette leaves cauline leaves _METHOD_ flowers and siliques were collected as a pool from week old plants grown in parallel in soil under long day conditions . the seedlings were grown on standard _METHOD_ medium and collected days after germination . the plant material was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after collection and stored at until use . rna was isolated from plant tissues using the _PROTEIN_ reagent according to the manufacturer s instructions . equal rna amounts quantified using a nanodrop instrument were treated with rnase free dnase . cdna was synthesized in a reaction from rna using oligo dt primers and first strand cdna synthesis kit following the manufacturer s recommendations . the absence of genomic dna in cdnas was verified by pcr with primers act s tccacgagacaacctataac and act a _PROTEIN_ spanning the second intron of _PROTEIN_ and visualized on agarose gel . the relative quantification of transcripts was performed with the applied _METHOD_ fast real time pcr system _METHOD_ _METHOD_ using a hydrolysis probe based assay and the faststart master mix with ng of starting template according to the manufacturer s instructions . the oligonucleotides and probes used for rt qpcr are listed in supplemental table . the experimental design included three biological replicates and three technical replicates for each reaction being carried out . a gene was considered to be _PROTEIN_ when the corresponding quantification cycle value was below or equal to . the primer efficiencies were estimated from the raw _METHOD_ data for each reaction over all pcr cycles using the linregpcr software . the pavrge method was used to calculate an average pcr efficiency . valid primer efficiencies were included in subsequent calculations . the transcript amount of each ggpps gene was normalized based on the _PROTEIN_ levels of three reference genes . the reference genes namely _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were selected under the _PROTEIN_ stability criterion across different organ types of a. thaliana . the _PROTEIN_ levels of the reference genes cover the range of _PROTEIN_ of the ggpps genes as indicated by the refgenes tool from . the _PROTEIN_ stability of the three reference genes in our experimental settings was tested using the genorm software . all three reference genes received valid _PROTEIN_ stability scores and were further used to estimate the normalization _PROTEIN_ by calculating the geometric average . to compare the differences in transcript levels of the ggpps genes between different organ samples the following formula was used nq_ { sample\ x } \frac { { e_ { ggppsx } { cq } } } { { e_ { { \text { re } f } } { cq } } } where nq sample x is calculated for each ggpps gene and represents the transcript quantity relative to the normalization _PROTEIN_ in one organ type . to compare the different _PROTEIN_ of each ggpps gene in different organs the relative quantities were calculated . the cq values were transformed to relative quantities as follows for each of the ggpps and reference genes the cq values corresponding to one gene in different organs were subtracted from the minimal cq value of the respective gene _PROTEIN_ according to the formula \updelta cq \hbox { min } cq_ { gene\ x } cq_ { gene\ x } rq_ { gene\ x } e { \updelta cq } where rq gene x is the transcript amount of one gene in a certain organ sample relative to the sample with the highest _PROTEIN_ . the rq gene x for each ggpps gene was normalized as described before and the normalized relative quantities _PROTEIN_ were calculated according to the modified pfaffl method using the formula which takes into accounts the different pcr efficiencies _PROTEIN_ \frac { { rq_ { ggpps } } } { { rq_ { ref } } } the _PROTEIN_ ratios were subsequently _PROTEIN_ transformed . the mrna levels for each ggpps gene across different organs are relative to the highest _PROTEIN_ potential for the respective gene and are normalized to the reference genes . the data represent the mean and standard _LOCATION_ of three biological replicates . to clone the transcriptional regulatory elements the sequences located upstream of the _PROTEIN_ start codon were amplified by pcr using a. thaliana genomic dna as template . in brief the genomic dna was extracted from seedlings using the nucleon phytopure system according to the manufacturer s instructions . to amplify the fragment of interest the phusion high fidelity dna polymerase kit was used . the oligonucleotides used for the amplification can be found in the supplemental table . the amplicons were cloned into the entry vector pentr/d topo according to the manufacturer s instructions resulting in pentr/d topo ggppspro vectors . plant _PROTEIN_ vectors were obtained by performing the gateway lr reaction according to the manufacturer s instructions between the entry vectors and the gus containing reporter vector resulting in pggppspro gus vectors . the agrobacterium tumefaciens strain was transformed with the resulting binary vectors and transgenes were subsequently introduced into arabidopsis via the floral dip method . at least two stable lines per isozyme were selected for further experiments . plant material was harvested and submerged in the x _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ solution containing mg x _PROTEIN_ mm sodium phosphate buffer ph v/v triton x and mm edta . the samples were incubated in the dark at until blue staining became visible . the chlorophyll was removed during serial washing with ethanol . the tissues were cleared by submerging in histoclear solution for several hours . plants were then photographed . ggpps transcript levels were determined from atgenexpress microarray experiments encompassing various organs at different developmental stages of arabidopsis . for the specific root tissues _PROTEIN_ profiles the microarray dataset generated by birnbaum et al . was used . for the seed _PROTEIN_ profiles the microarray data generated by le et al . were analyzed . the corresponding microarray _PROTEIN_ data were downloaded from the bio array resource website . for all the experimental conditions considered in this analysis except of figs . and the _PROTEIN_ values were retrieved in _PROTEIN_ scale . genes with an _PROTEIN_ value below a threshold of were treated as absent .
