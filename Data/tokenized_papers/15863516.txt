in plant cells unlike animal and yeast cells endomembrane dynamics appear to depend more on actin filaments than on microtubules . however the molecular _METHOD_ of endomembrane actin filament interactions are unknown . in this study we isolated and characterized an arabidopsis thaliana mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which has a defect in the organization of endomembranes and actin filaments . the _PROTEIN_ plants form abnormally large aggregates that consist of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ with actin filaments in the perinuclear region within the cells and are defective in normal cell elongation . map based cloning revealed that the _PROTEIN_ gene is allelic to the _PROTEIN_ gene . we demonstrate that the _PROTEIN_ protein is a type ii _LOCATION_ protein composed of a short _LOCATION_ n terminal domain and a transmembrane domain followed by a large lumenal domain and is localized specifically on _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . we further show that actin filaments interact with _LOCATION_ stacks via _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ the proper organization of endomembranes . our results provide functional evidence that _PROTEIN_ is a novel component of the _LOCATION_ mediated organization of actin functioning in proper endomembrane organization and cell elongation .
to isolate arabidopsis mutants that have an abnormal endomembrane structure within the cells we used a transgenic arabidopsis _METHOD_ which _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ targeted _METHOD_ . previously we reported the light dependent disappearance of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ . light grown _METHOD_ does not exhibit fluoresced _LOCATION_ but _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in entire endomembranes including _LOCATION_ network structures and dot like structures of the _LOCATION_ complex . in this study all _METHOD_ images were taken from light grown plants . _METHOD_ seeds were mutagenized and lines were obtained . of seedlings examined with the _METHOD_ microscope we isolated a mutant whose endomembrane formed large aggregates and designated the mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ after the japanese word for aggregate . the aggregates were found in most of the cells of cotyledons hypocotyls and flower stalks they were also found in some cells of siliques roots root hairs and trichomes . a higher magnification of a _METHOD_ image showed that the aggregates were composed of many small particles . small aggregates of endomembranes that moved on the _LOCATION_ network were also observed on the surface of leaf cells . these observations imply that the endomembranes are fragmented and/or deformed . to identify the components of the aggregates we visualized various organelles in leaf epidermal cells from d old seedlings of _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ by transient _PROTEIN_ of monomeric red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged marker proteins staining and diamidino phenylindole staining . most of the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ were completely merged with the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ aggregates causing the aggregates to become yellow _METHOD_ . some of the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ stacks were engulfed in the aggregates . some of the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ were detected as red _METHOD_ particles in the aggregates . most of the stained endosomes were detected as red _METHOD_ small particles and their assembly which were found in the green _METHOD_ aggregates . these results suggested that the _LOCATION_ is specifically aggregated whereas the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and endosomes are nonspecifically engulfed in the aggregates in _PROTEIN_ cells . dapi stained _LOCATION_ were close to the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ aggregates suggesting that the aggregates are located in the perinuclear region . electron microscopic analysis showed that the epidermal cells of wild type roots were occupied by a large central _LOCATION_ surrounded by a _LOCATION_ . on the contrary epidermal cells of _PROTEIN_ roots had a cytoplasmic aggregate abnormally at the center of the cell . higher magnification revealed that the cytoplasmic aggregate contained many fragmented _LOCATION_ and a _LOCATION_ . these results suggest that the aggregates which are composed of various organelles including _LOCATION_ are found in cells of different organs in _PROTEIN_ . to identify the _PROTEIN_ gene we used a map based cloning approach with codominant cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence markers and simple sequence length polymorphism markers and found that _PROTEIN_ is located on chromosome between markers _PROTEIN_ and . further mapping using plants that exhibited the phenotype conferred by _PROTEIN_ and dna sequencing showed a single base pair mutation from c to t in the _GENE_ gene of _PROTEIN_ which might cause a nonsense mutation from caa to taa . to confirm that the mutation in the _GENE_ gene is responsible for the phenotype conferred by _PROTEIN_ we analyzed knockout mutants of the _GENE_ gene from the salk t dna insertion line collections . we isolated two lines in which t dna was inserted into the _GENE_ coding region and named these mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . to visualize the endomembranes a _LOCATION_ targeted _METHOD_ sp _METHOD_ was transiently _PROTEIN_ in epidermal cells of rosette leaves of each _PROTEIN_ allele by particle bombardment . figure shows the aggregates of endomembranes in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cells as seen in the _PROTEIN_ cells . in addition we confirmed that constitutive _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ rescued the phenotype conferred by _PROTEIN_ . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is the _GENE_ gene . the _PROTEIN_ gene encodes a polypeptide sequence of amino acids with a single putative transmembrane domain . immunoblot analysis with the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody showed that the kd protein was accumulated in _METHOD_ but not in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ had an exostosin like domain . exostosins act as glycosyltransferases which catalyze the formation of heparan sulfate an _LOCATION_ glycosaminoglycan in animal cells . the arabidopsis mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which have a missense mutation in the _GENE_ gene lacked glycosyltransferase activity . to determine whether a deficiency of glycosyltransferase activity in _PROTEIN_ is responsible for the defect in endomembrane organization in _PROTEIN_ we examined endomembrane organization in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the kd immunopositive protein was accumulated in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as in _METHOD_ . we _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ targeted _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ leaves and inspected the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ endomembranes . both mutants exhibited normal endomembrane organization in the cells like wild type plants . this result indicates that glycosyltransferase activity is not involved in the organization of the endomembranes . a hydropathy plot of _PROTEIN_ suggests that a transmembrane domain is located in the n terminal region . _PROTEIN_ was extracted from microsomes of wild type seedlings by detergent but not by high salt or alkaline ph . this profile was the same as that of an integral _LOCATION_ protein atvsr _LOCATION_ . this result indicates that _PROTEIN_ is an integral _LOCATION_ protein . to determine the _LOCATION_ topology of _PROTEIN_ we used transgenic arabidopsis plants which overexpress the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion in the _PROTEIN_ background . the phenotypes conferred by _PROTEIN_ were fully complemented in the transgenic plants suggesting that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ has activity for endomembrane organization like endogenous _PROTEIN_ . microsomes isolated from the transgenic plants were incubated with proteinase k either in the presence or the absence of detergent . subsequently the sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ was evaluated by immunoblot analysis with anti _PROTEIN_ antibody which was raised against the c terminal domain of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ became sensitive to protease digestion only when the microsomes were solubilized with detergent suggesting that the epitope is exposed to the lumen . these results together with the hydropathy analysis indicate that _PROTEIN_ has a type ii topology with a short n terminus exposed to the _LOCATION_ a single transmembrane spanning domain and a c terminus inside the lumen . in sucrose density gradient fractions of a homogenate of arabidopsis seedlings _PROTEIN_ cosedimented with a _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ but not with a prevacuolar compartment/trans _LOCATION_ network marker atvsr or a _LOCATION_ marker bip . this finding suggests that _PROTEIN_ is localized on the _LOCATION_ stack . to visualize the intracellular localization of _PROTEIN_ we constructed chimeric genes encoding modified _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was composed of the full length of _PROTEIN_ followed by _METHOD_ whereas _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was composed of the c terminal truncated form of _PROTEIN_ followed by _METHOD_ . each fusion protein was transiently _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts prepared from arabidopsis suspension cultured cells . these modified _METHOD_ were completely merged with a _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ localizes on the _LOCATION_ stacks and that its n terminal portion is sufficient for _LOCATION_ targeting . it is well known that the _LOCATION_ is involved in the intracellular positioning and movement of organelles . to investigate how the _LOCATION_ contributes to the _PROTEIN_ of endomembranes we examined the effect of _LOCATION_ disordering reagents on the endomembranes of _METHOD_ seedlings . latrunculin b which depolymerizes actin filaments disordered the endomembranes in epidermal cells of cotyledons . the network structure of the cortical _LOCATION_ was completely destroyed and blobs of the endomembranes were formed on the surface of latrunculin b treated cells . aggregates of endomembranes were found in the perinuclear region of the treated cells as in _PROTEIN_ cells . on the contrary neither of two microtubule disordering reagents had any effect on the structure of the endomembranes . we also found that the latrunculin b induced aggregates were perfectly colocalized with the _METHOD_ tagged _LOCATION_ marker . these results suggest that intact actin filaments but not microtubules are necessary for the _PROTEIN_ of endomembrane structures . treatment with the actin depolymerizing reagent caused _METHOD_ cells to develop a _PROTEIN_ like phenotype . this implies that actin is disorganized in the phenotype conferred by _PROTEIN_ . staining with phalloidin revealed that some of actin filaments coaggregated with the endomembranes in _PROTEIN_ cotyledon cells whereas no aggregates of actin were found in _METHOD_ cells . to confirm the organization of actin filaments in living cells we transiently _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ construct which encodes an actin binding domain of fimbrin protein followed by _METHOD_ in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ which has no _METHOD_ . the actin filaments were aggregated and the cortical network partially disappeared in _PROTEIN_ . however a few intact actin filaments were still found in _PROTEIN_ cells suggesting that the mutant phenotype is not completely equivalent to the result of actin depolymerization . these results raise the possibility that _PROTEIN_ interacts with actin and regulates the proper distribution of actin filaments in wild type plants . to investigate this possibility we immunoprecipitated detergent solubilized extracts from arabidopsis cultured cells with both anti _PROTEIN_ and anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies . the immunoprecipitates were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti _PROTEIN_ or anti actin antibodies . the results clearly show that _PROTEIN_ coimmunoprecipitated with actin . on the contrary actin did not precipitate in the control experiments with each preimmune serum or anti bip and anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies . this result suggests that _PROTEIN_ interacts with actin within the cells . _PROTEIN_ showed a dwarf phenotype at different developmental stages . the _PROTEIN_ seedlings were significantly smaller than the _METHOD_ seedlings . the _PROTEIN_ plants had wrinkled leaves and short petioles and exhibited dwarf stature . when grown in the dark the length of the _PROTEIN_ hypocotyl was only one third that of the _METHOD_ hypocotyl . these phenotypes were also observed in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants but not in _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ plants . the _PROTEIN_ cells in hypocotyls were significantly smaller and fatter than _METHOD_ cells and exhibited abnormal shape . on the contrary there were no differences in the number of epidermal cells of hypocotyls between _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ . therefore the dwarf stature of _PROTEIN_ is largely or exclusively attributable to a failure of individual cells to elongate rather than to a defect in cell division .

_PROTEIN_ and cgtctagaatgtttccaagggtttctatga and cgctcgagggaactagaattggctactggt for _PROTEIN_ . the amplified fragments were inserted into the xbai xhoi site of _METHOD_ . these chimeric genes encode
