the cell wall associated receptor kinase and wak like kinase gene family members are good candidates for physical linkers that signal between the cell wall and the cytoplasmic compartment . previous studies have suggested that while some wak/wakl members play a role in bacterial pathogen and heavy metal aluminum responses others are involved in cell elongation and plant development . here we report a functional role for the _PROTEIN_ gene in arabidopsis mineral responses . confocal microscopic studies localized _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein fusion proteins on the cell surfaces suggesting that like other wak/wakl proteins _PROTEIN_ protein is associated with the cell wall . histochemical analyses of the _PROTEIN_ promoter fused with the _PROTEIN_ reporter gene have shown that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is induced by na k and . a transgenic line with a t dna insertion at bp upstream of the _PROTEIN_ start codon was characterized . while the t dna insertion had little effect on the _PROTEIN_ transcript levels under normal growth conditions it significantly altered the _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ under various conditions of mineral nutrients . semiquantitative and quantitative reverse transcription pcr analyses showed that the promoter impairment abolished _PROTEIN_ induced _PROTEIN_ by na k and but not by . whereas the _PROTEIN_ promoter impairment resulted in hypersensitivity to k na and it conferred a better tolerance to toxic levels of the heavy metal . _PROTEIN_ was required for the up regulation of zinc transporter genes during zinc deficiency and the _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion resulted in a reduction of accumulation in shoots . a _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein fusion gene driven by either the _PROTEIN_ native promoter or the constitutive promoter complemented the phenotypes . our results suggest versatile roles for _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis mineral nutrition responses .
previous cellular and biochemical studies have shown that several wak/wakl members are localized on the cell surface and tightly associated with the cell wall . the predicted structural features for _PROTEIN_ protein suggest it may also be associated with the cell wall . to test this possibility we generated transgenic plants that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion proteins . as shown in figure protein gel blot analysis detected high levels of the _METHOD_ fusion proteins in the transgenic plants . confocal microscopic analyses of the root cells of the transgenic plants confirmed that _METHOD_ _METHOD_ is localized in the cell surface region overlapping the cell wall and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . closer examination of the root cell _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ revealed that the fusion proteins are forming patch like structures on the cell surface . to further verify the nature of the cell wall association of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins roots cells were plasmolyzed in a m nacl solution and the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was examined . while the majority of the green _METHOD_ remained in the cell wall region a small amount migrated together to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to biochemically confirm the nature of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ cell wall association soluble and insoluble proteins were fractionated from the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants and analyzed by protein gel blotting using a _METHOD_ antibody . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ shown as a band of kd was highly enriched in the insoluble pellet . extraction of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ from the insoluble fraction like that of _PROTEIN_ required boiling in mm dithiothreitol and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a known _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein was used as a control . as expected _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ shown as a band of kd was highly enriched in the soluble protein fraction . these results suggest _PROTEIN_ like other studied wak/wakl members is a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ tightly associated with the cell wall . prior analyses showed _PROTEIN_ was slightly _PROTEIN_ in the leaf hydathode _PROTEIN_ hypocotyl root junction and _PROTEIN_ root initiation site . to gain further insight into the _PROTEIN_ profile of the _PROTEIN_ gene in responding to environmental stresses transgenic plants carrying a construct of the _PROTEIN_ promoter fused to the _PROTEIN_ reporter gene were analyzed . seedlings were grown in either murashige and skoog _METHOD_ medium as a control or _METHOD_ medium supplemented with various additional mineral nutrients . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ gus activities strongly responded to elevated levels of na k and . under the _METHOD_ growth condition the _PROTEIN_ promoter is slightly active in the vasculature of the leaf petiole and hypocotyl and little gus activity was observed in roots . _PROTEIN_ gus activity in the vasculature was greatly enhanced by all five added mineral nutrients . high levels of gus activity were observed in vascular tissues of seedlings grown in media with mm nacl and . in particular heavy gus staining was observed in the vascular tissues of hypocotyls in seedlings grown in media with either nickel or zinc . _PROTEIN_ promoter activity was also greatly induced in hypocotyl root junctions by all five added mineral nutrients . in addition all nutrients but copper significantly enhanced _PROTEIN_ gus activity at the _PROTEIN_ root initiation sites . similar to that in the hypocotyls nickel or zinc treatment resulted in a higher gus _PROTEIN_ in the vasculature of the roots . a comprehensive analysis of publicly available microarray data was carried out . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ profiles were obtained through genevestigator by analyzing data from experiments of more than microarray _PROTEIN_ and were compared to our gus _PROTEIN_ results . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ patterns in different organs and under various biotic and abiotic stresses revealed by the microarray data were consistent with our gus results . microarray results confirmed that the highest _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was found in roots and that salt stress significantly induced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . as much as a fold increase of the _PROTEIN_ transcript was found in salt treated seedlings . consistent with our observations the salt induced _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to be related to elevated minerals and not to general water deprivation as various drought and osmotic stress conditions failed to induce _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to genetically analyze the functions of _PROTEIN_ we attempted to isolate _PROTEIN_ knockout mutants from a number of available collections of t dna transgenic plants . using a primer bp upstream of _PROTEIN_ and a t dna left border primer a pcr screening in a dna superpool _PROTEIN_ identified a line with a t dna inserted in the promoter region proximal to the beginning of the _PROTEIN_ gene . sequencing analysis confirmed a t dna insertion at bp upstream of the _PROTEIN_ start codon as illustrated in figure . this insertional line is hereafter designated as _PROTEIN_ . genomic dna gel blot and genetic segregation analyses suggested that the obtained line carried a homozygous mutation for _PROTEIN_ . dna isolated from either the wild type or the _PROTEIN_ were digested with ecori and fractionated . a _PROTEIN_ specific fragment used to probe the genomic dna blot identified one fragment in the wild type lane and two fragments in the _PROTEIN_ lane suggesting that the t dna insertion resulted in homozygous _PROTEIN_ interruption . _PROTEIN_ is part of the _PROTEIN_ gene cluster . specific reverse transcription pcr analyses of _PROTEIN_ showed that the t dna insertion had little effect on the _PROTEIN_ of other clustered wakl genes . to understand the regulatory _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ and to verify the functional roles for _PROTEIN_ protein two transformation constructs _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were generated and utilized to transform _PROTEIN_ plants . more than independent transgenic lines were obtained for each construct and representative lines were used for detailed molecular characterizations . seeds for wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants were plated in either _METHOD_ medium or _METHOD_ medium supplemented with mm nacl mm kcl and respectively . fourteen day old seedlings were harvested for total rna extraction and subsequently for rt pcr analyses . a pair of gene specific primers was designed in a unique region spanning the two introns of the _PROTEIN_ gene and their _PROTEIN_ specificity was confirmed by sequencing their rt pcr products . as shown in figure consistent with our previously established gus _PROTEIN_ profile _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was significantly up regulated by mm nacl mm kcl and . a constitutive actin gene was used to normalize the _PROTEIN_ transcript levels in each sample and the _PROTEIN_ transcript changes were calculated based on that of the wild type grown on _METHOD_ medium . compared to the wild type control both the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants gave more than fold higher _PROTEIN_ transcripts . while the _PROTEIN_ transcript level in _PROTEIN_ slightly dropped in _METHOD_ medium it was significantly reduced in medium containing either mm nacl or mm kcl . in contrast to other nutrients nickel has an opposite effect on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ . rt pcr analysis detected a noticeable increase of the _PROTEIN_ transcript in _PROTEIN_ grown in _METHOD_ medium with nickel . this observation was confirmed by several independently repeated rt pcr experiments . to further verify this unexpected result quantitative real time rt pcr analyses were used to determine _PROTEIN_ transcript abundance in samples grown in _METHOD_ medium with nickel . a constitutive actin gene was included in the same tube real time rt pcr assay for normalization purposes and changes of the _PROTEIN_ transcript abundance were calculated based on the level of that in the wild type as . as shown in figure the _PROTEIN_ transcript level in the _PROTEIN_ mutant grown in the presence of nickel showed a increase when compared to that in the wild type . it also confirmed high levels of _PROTEIN_ transcripts of as much as a fold increase in the overexpression lines consistent with the results from the previous semiquantitative rt pcr experiment . as a positive control na was shown to notably enhance _PROTEIN_ transcript abundance in the wild type . the results of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ studies strongly suggest a functional role for _PROTEIN_ in mineral nutrient responses . we initially observed that _PROTEIN_ seedlings consistently showed retarded root growth when grown in full or one half strength _METHOD_ nutrients . as shown in figure while little root length differences between the wild type and _PROTEIN_ were observed on _METHOD_ medium _PROTEIN_ root lengths on _METHOD_ were reduced by more than as compared to the wild type.the root length reduction phenotype was complemented when a wild type copy of the _PROTEIN_ gene in the form of either _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was introduced back into the _PROTEIN_ plants . to further determine which mineral nutrient in _METHOD_ medium caused _PROTEIN_ root sensitivity various nutrients were added into _METHOD_ medium and tested for _PROTEIN_ growth . as shown in figure both mm kcl and mm nacl had a dramatic effect on _PROTEIN_ root growth . root lengths of _PROTEIN_ seedlings were reduced by more than by both salts . both compl and ox showed restoration of root growth although the latter was less effective . seedlings of _PROTEIN_ were also tested on _METHOD_ medium supplemented with either or . as shown in figure both and significantly affected root lengths of _PROTEIN_ seedlings . and reduced _PROTEIN_ root length by more than and respectively . the root length reductions were recovered in both the compl and the ox lines . the arabidopsis zinc transporter _PROTEIN_ genes were known to be regulated by zinc availability . to gain further insight into a possible role for _PROTEIN_ in zinc response we analyzed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in both root and shoot tissues of wild type _PROTEIN_ compl and ox lines . seedlings were grown in either _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ medium supplemented with and used for total rna extraction . pairs of _PROTEIN_ gene specific primers were used for rt pcr analyses . figure shows that all four _PROTEIN_ genes were _PROTEIN_ in roots of the wild type plant and their _PROTEIN_ responded to deficiency . little _PROTEIN_ of all _PROTEIN_ genes but _PROTEIN_ was found in roots when the growth medium was supplemented with . in wild type shoots while _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were suppressed in the medium _PROTEIN_ was slightly induced under the same condition . the deficiency induced _PROTEIN_ for all four _PROTEIN_ genes appeared to be abolished in _PROTEIN_ . when _PROTEIN_ seedlings were grown on _METHOD_ medium transcripts for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ became undetectable and the transcript of _PROTEIN_ was dramatically reduced . transcript levels for all four _PROTEIN_ genes were completely recovered in both the _PROTEIN_ compl and the _PROTEIN_ ox line in both roots and shoots . zinc content was measured in wild type _PROTEIN_ compl and ox lines . seedlings were grown on _METHOD_ medium supplemented with and their shoots and roots were separated for determination . there was no significant difference in levels in roots of the four samples . in contrast levels were dramatically reduced in _PROTEIN_ shoots . this reduction was fully recovered in both the compl and ox lines . in addition the ox line contained a higher level of in both shoots and roots . on _METHOD_ medium supplemented with wild type roots accumulated twice the amount of as wild type shoots . the calculated ratios of content in shoots versus in roots of the wild type indicated an average value of whereas that of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to about . these results suggest a likely role for _PROTEIN_ in accumulation in shoots . a slightly increased _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ level was detected in _PROTEIN_ when treated with and a constitutively enhanced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was observed in the compl plants . to test whether the elevated _PROTEIN_ in had any physiological effects on arabidopsis growth we plated wild type _PROTEIN_ compl and ox on media containing various levels of . in general arabidopsis is considered to be nontolerant to . as shown in figure in the wild type as little as of caused a dramatic inhibition of root growth and resulted in lethality . in contrast seedlings of _PROTEIN_ compl and ox gave much better root growth than the wild type . both the _PROTEIN_ and the compl plants survived well at . ox plants consistently showed robust growth at the three concentrations . at root lengths of wild type seedlings were about of that of ox . increased concentration had a dramatic effect on wild type root length but not on ox . at root lengths of the wild type dropped to less than of that of ox . these results established a good correlation between _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the tolerance . measurements of plant content showed no significant differences of levels in either shoot or root among wild type _PROTEIN_ compl and ox plants suggesting a possible role of _PROTEIN_ in cellular detoxification rather than transportation or accumulation .
