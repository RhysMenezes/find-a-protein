secondary metabolites are major constituents of plant defense against herbivore attack . relatively little is known about the cell type specific formation and antiherbivore activities of secondary compounds in roots despite the substantial impact of root herbivory on plant performance and fitness . here we describe the constitutive formation of semivolatile diterpenes called rhizathalenes by the class i terpene synthase in roots of arabidopsis thaliana . the primary enzymatic product of _PROTEIN_ rhizathalene a which is produced from the substrate all trans geranylgeranyl diphosphate represents a so far unidentified class of tricyclic diterpene _PROTEIN_ skeletons with an unusual tricyclic spiro hydrindane structure . protein targeting and administration of stable isotope precursors indicate that rhizathalenes are biosynthesized in root leucoplasts . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is largely localized to the root stele suggesting a centric and gradual release of its diterpene products into the peripheral root cell layers . we demonstrate that roots of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ mutant plants grown aeroponically and in potting substrate are more susceptible to herbivory by the opportunistic root herbivore fungus gnat and suffer substantial removal of peripheral tissue at larval feeding sites . our work provides evidence for the in vivo role of semivolatile diterpene metabolites as local antifeedants in belowground direct defense against root feeding insects .
from the tps genes that are constitutively _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis roots five _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were previously predicted to function as diterpene synthases . therefore we investigated the possible formation of diterpenes in arabidopsis roots grown under different culture conditions . columbia wild type plants were grown in potting mix hydroponic culture axenic culture supplemented with suc and aeroponic culture . under the assumption that some of the diterpenes produced in arabidopsis roots were volatile we applied automated solid phase microextraction to collect volatiles from roots that were detached from plants grown under the different culture conditions . four diterpene olefins were detected by gas chromatography _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis of volatiles emitted from hydroponically grown roots . only the predominant diterpene compound a was detected from roots grown in the other culture conditions . the _METHOD_ spectrum of this compound resembled that of a tricyclic hydrocarbon diterpene but did not match the spectra of any other known diterpene compounds listed in the national institute of standards and technology/wiley libraries other databases or references . therefore we named these diterpene compounds rhizathalene a to d . quantitative analysis of the detected diterpenes by solvent extraction of root tissue and subsequent gas chromatography flame ionization detection showed highest concentrations of rhizathalene a in hydroponically grown roots of ng fresh weight . by comparison ng of rhizathalene was found in roots grown in sterile liquid culture and to ng fresh weight was detected in roots from plants grown in soil or under aeroponic culture conditions . other volatile terpenes that were detected in small amounts from arabidopsis roots were the monoterpene cineole and the sesquiterpene bisabolene which have been described as products of the root _PROTEIN_ terpene synthases _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . to identify the tps gene responsible for rhizathalene formation we analyzed roots from two independent t dna insertions in or near the genes of the five putative root specific diterpene synthases for the absence of rhizathalene a . only a single line with a t dna insertion in the sixth exon of the gene _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ did not produce rhizathalene a nor was the _PROTEIN_ transcript detected by rt pcr . by contrast a t dna insertion in the untranslated region of _PROTEIN_ in line _PROTEIN_ did not affect the formation of rhizathalene a or _PROTEIN_ transcript levels . _PROTEIN_ was therefore used as a t dna control line . since only a single _PROTEIN_ null mutant was available we conducted dna gel blot analysis to confirm that the lack of rhizathalene formation in the mutant was caused by a single t dna insertion in the _PROTEIN_ gene . to complement the _PROTEIN_ loss of function phenotype we transformed the _PROTEIN_ mutant with the _PROTEIN_ gene under the control of a kb _PROTEIN_ promoter fragment . _PROTEIN_ was found to be _PROTEIN_ and rhizathalene emitted from roots of at least three independently established transgenic plants . however the _PROTEIN_ transcript and diterpene compound were observed at lower abundance in the transgenic lines than in the wild type indicating that the phenotype was only partially restored because of a possible lack of full activity of the selected promoter region . to confirm the catalytic activity of the _PROTEIN_ enzyme we cloned a bp cdna of _PROTEIN_ lacking the first bp which encode a putative amino acid _LOCATION_ transit peptide into the escherichia coli _PROTEIN_ vector topo . the partially purified recombinant _PROTEIN_ enzyme converted all trans ggpp into several diterpene compounds . the retention time and _METHOD_ spectrum of the major enzymatic product were identical with that of rhizathalene a . accordingly the _METHOD_ spectra of the three less abundant compounds were identical to those of rhizathalene b c and d which had been detected in roots of hydroponically grown plants . incubation of the _PROTEIN_ recombinant enzyme with the substrates gpp and farnesyl diphosphate did not result in the formation of enzyme specific products in comparison to assays with protein extracts prepared from bacterial cells carrying the empty _PROTEIN_ vector . kinetic characterization of the partially purified recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein showed a low apparent km value for all trans ggpp of which is in the range of those reported from other plant diterpene synthases including the class i type casbene and taxadiene synthases . the vmax was pkat and the kcat was resulting in a kcat/km value of which is to fold lower than those found for taxadiene and casbene synthase . consistent with other tps enzymes the activity of _PROTEIN_ was dependent on the presence of as a divalent metal ion . to elucidate the molecular structure of rhizathalene a we produced larger amounts of the diterpene compound by transformation of the e. coli strain with the topo _PROTEIN_ vector construct . strain contained an additional pacycduet ragggps plasmid carrying the pseudomature ggpp synthase from grand fir ragggps . after collection of rhizathalene a from the headspace of liters of bacterial cultures coexpressing the ggpp synthase and _PROTEIN_ enzymes and subsequent purification of the compound by liquid chromatography _METHOD_ _METHOD_ the molecular formula and structure were verified and obtained using nmr experiments that included proton nmr double quantum filtered correlated spectroscopy _PROTEIN_ rotating frame overhauser enhancement spectroscopy total correlated spectroscopy heteronuclear single quantum coherence with distortionless enhancement by _PROTEIN_ transfer _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and heteronuclear multiple bond coherence . proton and _PROTEIN_ chemical shifts are shown in supplemental table online . the analysis revealed a novel tricyclic diterpene _PROTEIN_ structure with a cyclopenta spiro undecane skeleton . the relative stereochemistry was deduced from the roesy spectrum . complete listings of correlations are presented in supplemental table online . assignment of the relative stereochemistry was supported by the results of quantum chemical calculations . and chemical shifts for all possible diastereomers were computed using density functional theory and the assigned structure of rhizathalene a was the diastereomer whose computed chemical shifts best matched the experimentally determined chemical shifts with mean average deviations between computed and experimental shifts of only ppm for and ppm for . the relative stereochemistry proposed for rhizathalene a at and corresponds to that of the structurally related spiro decane sesquiterpene acoradiene . the absolute configuration of rhizathalene a has not yet been determined . since diterpenes are primarily synthesized in chloroplasts we examined whether _PROTEIN_ was targeted to _LOCATION_ of arabidopsis root cells . targetp and chlorop _METHOD_ predicted a _LOCATION_ transit peptide of _PROTEIN_ of amino acids . to determine the subcellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein we generated transgenic plants in the _PROTEIN_ knockout background _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ transit peptide in c terminal fusion with _METHOD_ proteins under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus and the native _PROTEIN_ promoters . analysis of hypocotyl tissue from independent _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ lines showed a subcellular localization of green _METHOD_ in _LOCATION_ confirming that the _PROTEIN_ protein is targeted to these organelles . in yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion lines carrying the _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in leucoplasts of the root stele indicating a primary _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in this tissue . to investigate to what extent rhizathalene a is produced from precursors synthesized by the _LOCATION_ mep pathway we administered different concentrations of deuterium labeled deoxyxylulose to axenic arabidopsis hairy root cultures and determined how much of the labeled precursor was incorporated into rhizathalene a after and h of incubation . headspace volatile analysis of roots incubated with or mg/ml dox for h indicated that of the detected rhizathalene a was labeled . occurrence of the fully labeled isomer is apparent by an increase in the molecular _METHOD_ of from to . we also analyzed the incorporation of deuterated mevalonolactone at a concentration of mg/ml under the same incubation times . under these conditions only a trace amount of labeled rhizathalene a was detected indicating a minimal contribution of precursors from the mva pathway to the formation of the diterpene compound . tissue specific activity of the _PROTEIN_ promoter was examined in planta by staining of transformed arabidopsis plants carrying a _PROTEIN_ fusion . gus staining was observed exclusively in the roots of at least three independent lines in the generation . in seedlings grown on sterile murashige and skoog medium weak gus staining was detected in the stele and at the tips of both primary and secondary roots . in comparison hydroponically grown gus plants showed considerably stronger gus activity in the same tissues and cell types . this result is consistent with the higher transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ observed under hydroponic culture conditions . to investigate the defensive activity of rhizathalene in planta we established an aeroponic clay pellet culture system that _PROTEIN_ a suitable belowground environment for a root herbivore while providing easy access to the root tissue . we selected bradysia as a root herbivore since bradysia larvae were shown to be destructive to arabidopsis seedlings and jasmonate insensitive mutants with impaired root defense . wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants were grown in aeroponic culture for weeks and subsequently treated with to bradysia larvae of the second and third instar which were allowed to feed on the roots for d. the number of larvae is equivalent to the offspring of a single fungus gnat female laying up to eggs . the amount of root _METHOD_ remaining after bradysia feeding was compared with that of noninfested control plants . wild type and mutant plants showed a reduction of root _METHOD_ but significantly less root tissue was recovered from _PROTEIN_ plants in comparison to wild type plants and the _PROTEIN_ t dna control which produced rhizathalene at wild type levels . the percentage of root _METHOD_ consumed from control plants ranged between and while to of root tissue was consumed from _PROTEIN_ plants amounting to a to higher loss of root tissue than that of controls . we also tested the effect of bradysia feeding on wild type and mutant plants at the seedling stage . fourteen day old seedlings planted in potting mix were subjected to a more moderate infestation of larvae per plant . the seedling _METHOD_ of the wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ by larval feeding was compared with that of nondamaged controls . all seedlings treated with bradysia larvae showed reduced growth . however seedlings of the _PROTEIN_ line consistently had significantly less _METHOD_ after larval feeding than wild type seedlings and those of the _PROTEIN_ line . the percentage of reduction in seedling _METHOD_ was between and for wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants . by comparison reduction of _METHOD_ was significantly higher for seedlings of the _PROTEIN_ line ranging between and . we did not determine differences in larval weight in both bioassays since a quantitative recovery and weight measurement of the small larvae from both substrates proved to be too difficult . since there was a significant difference in the amount of root tissue remaining after bradysia larval feeding we investigated possible differences in larval feeding behavior by comparing the larval root damage of aeroponically grown wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants . after removal of the clay granules undamaged and damaged roots were examined under a dissecting microscope . undamaged _PROTEIN_ roots were phenotypically indistinguishable from wild type roots . wild type roots were visibly damaged by larval feeding . portions of the root epidermis and cortex were removed and several root tips were severed . generally larvae avoided feeding on the vascular tissue and parts of the endodermis . by contrast damage of roots of the _PROTEIN_ line was much more severe per feeding site resulting in the consumption of approximately three times more tissue per site . large areas of the root tissue were completely stripped of the epidermis and cortex and the endodermis and phloem were consumed leaving only a string of lignified xylem cells and resulting in figures to . the difference between the total amount of tissue removed from _PROTEIN_ and wild type roots was somewhat smaller than that observed per feeding site indicating that larvae feeding on wild type roots moved more frequently from one site to the next whereas they spent more time per feeding site on roots of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . to further corroborate the effect of rhizathalene on bradysia larval feeding behavior we designed a nonchoice in vitro experiment according to citation . two fungus gnat larvae were placed in glass cylinders containing a mushroom and potato agar diet with various concentrations of rhizathalene a . after h of larval feeding the average volume of diet containing to ng of rhizathalene a was significantly less than control diets containing _METHOD_ . many terpene synthases that are involved in the defense against herbivores show induced _PROTEIN_ in response to mechanical wounding or feeding damage . using real time quantitative pcr _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels from aeroponically grown wild type arabidopsis roots exposed to and d of bradysia larval feeding were compared with the _PROTEIN_ in uninfested roots . no increased _PROTEIN_ mrna levels were found in response to larval feeding for these particular time points . we also tested whether _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ could be induced by treatment with the defense hormone jasmonic acid . _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were slightly induced upon treatment with ja for h in axenic culture but this increase did not correspond to a significant change in the amount of rhizathalene produced . however a more stringent correlation between diterpene production and the extent of _PROTEIN_ transcription was observed in roots of plants grown under different culture conditions . the highest _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were found in roots of hydroponically grown plants corresponding to the highest concentrations of rhizathalene a in these roots whereas the lowest accumulation of _PROTEIN_ mrna and rhizathalene a were present in roots of plants grown in potting mix .
