negatively regulates the drought response through the modulation of osmolytic components and regulates pollen tube length in arabidopsis .
in order to determine the key genes involved in cellular pro metabolism in arabidopsis pca mutants were generated and characterized under dehydration conditions . because _PROTEIN_ is known to hyperaccumulate pro in response to water deficit conditions the activation tagged population was screened for _PROTEIN_ pro concentration to drought stress compared with the _PROTEIN_ mutant . _PROTEIN_ mutants were transformed with agrobacterium harboring the binary vector which contained four copies of the cauliflower mosaic virus enhancer at the right border of the t dna and a bar gene as a selectable marker . transformants were selected on soil sprayed with _PROTEIN_ and subsequently screened under drought condition . approximately activation tagged _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines were screened and nine mutants were selected during drought stress . one of the mutant lines was analyzed for further physiological and molecular characterization . pro accumulation in the mutant was found to be similar under water deficit conditions to that of the wt while the pro content of was significantly lower than that of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . these results suggest that participates in the suppression of pro production in _PROTEIN_ mutants under drought conditions . proline content in the leaves of wt _PROTEIN_ and plants . light grown week old plants were grown for d without watering . leaf tissues were carefully excised after drought treatment and their proline content was measured . _LOCATION_ bars represent the sd . differences among wt _PROTEIN_ and plants grown under the same conditions are significant at < p < . et al . demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ an ubiquitin ligase is involved in the drought response . because the mutant was obtained from activation tagged _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines it is likely to be related to abiotic stress responses . to determine whether could be associated with abiotic stress responses we examined cotyledon greening in wt _PROTEIN_ and seedlings in the presence of mannitol peg or aba . the germination rate among the wt _PROTEIN_ and was similar and not poor in _METHOD_ medium . in addition developmental processes were not affected in the mutant . comparison of the and _PROTEIN_ mutants demonstrated that significantly fewer cotyledons expanded and turned green after d germination when grown on _METHOD_ medium containing mm mannitol peg or aba whereas the cotyledon greening rate was similar between wt and seedlings except under the peg condition . these results showed that the mutant was more likely to be sensitive to abiotic stresses than the _PROTEIN_ mutant . to evaluate further the response to drought stress cut rosette water loss rates of the plants were estimated . to assess water loss from leaves leaves of similar size age and positions on the wt _PROTEIN_ and were detached and measured for _PROTEIN_ in fresh weight as described previously . after detachment leaves from the mutant exhibited higher loss of fresh weight than those from _PROTEIN_ through an experimental time course while the rate of water loss was similar in wt and plants . effect of the mutant on sensitivity to dehydration stress and aba sensitivity . effect of osmotic stress and aba on cotyledon greening . seeds were sown on _METHOD_ agar plates supplemented with mannitol peg or aba and permitted to grow for d seedlings with green cotyledons were then counted . _LOCATION_ bars represent the sd . differences among wt _PROTEIN_ and plants grown under the same conditions are significant at < p < or p < . in order to investigate the molecular changes associated with dehydration stress we evaluated four genes responsive to desiccation _PROTEIN_ responsive to aba _PROTEIN_ delta _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ reductase _PROTEIN_ and delta _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ synthase which are induced by various abiotic stresses . the transcript levels of dehydration inducible genes were more markedly reduced in and wt lines than in _PROTEIN_ mutants following mannitol treatment however the _PROTEIN_ of the four genes was similar in wt and plants . these observations support the notion that regulates the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ mediated stress marker genes under dehydration stress conditions . et al . demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ a basic leucine zipper transcription _PROTEIN_ is involved in hypo osmolarity and pro responsive _PROTEIN_ of pro dehydrogenase . the _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ participates in the up regulation of _PROTEIN_ transcription . as shown in supplemetnary fig . and f rehydration induced _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was significantly reduced in the _PROTEIN_ mutant in comparison with that in wt and plants under dehydration conditions however the transcript level of _PROTEIN_ increased more in _PROTEIN_ than in wt and plants . these results indicate that molecular events associated with pro content were reduced more in than in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . to identify the position of the t dna insertion site and the activated gene tail pcr was performed on the mutant using primers from both ends of the lb and ad primers . the sequences flanking the lb region obtained from analysis of the tail pcr products were subjected to a blast search and a single insertion site was mapped in . the t dna insertion in was located on the intergenic region between the two genes and which encode an unknown protein and _PROTEIN_ respectively . the t dna locus in was found close to . to characterize further the t dna associated dna sequence specific primers _PROTEIN_ were designed and used in combination with t dna specific primers to confirm the insertion site within the wt _PROTEIN_ and genome . to genotype the locus pcr primers and _PROTEIN_ were used to amplify the wt and _PROTEIN_ sequences while primers and were used to detect the mutant . using the primer pair only the mutant but not the wt or _PROTEIN_ mutant could be amplified by pcr . furthermore rt pcr indicated that the _PROTEIN_ transcript accumulated in day old wt seedlings but was not detectable in _PROTEIN_ and mutant seedlings . pcr based genotyping analyses showed that the t dna insertion co segregated with the phenotype . identification of enhancer elements containing the t dna insertion region in . a map of the t dna insertion of on chromosome . the structure of the activation tagged locus of is shown in the flanking region containing and . the arrows mark the positions of gene specific primers and a t dna lb specific primer used for pcr amplification . t dna linkage analysis of the phenotype . genomic pcr using the gene specific primers and _PROTEIN_ yielded a dna band specific for the wt and _PROTEIN_ lines at the locus whereas pcr using primers and produced a specific band . rt pcr to compare the transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ control genes in wt _PROTEIN_ and mutants . _PROTEIN_ of the three neighboring genes encoding a functional protein near the activation tagged locus was analyzed in plants and compared with those in _PROTEIN_ by rt pcr . _PROTEIN_ was used as an internal control for rt pcr . because the original mutant was identified in the generation it was expected to be a gain of function mutant . therefore we examined which neighboring genes would be overexpressed owing to the four copies of the camv enhancer elements in the activation tagging vector . in order to test the hypothesis we used an rt pcr approach . through several approaches using different primer pairs in the rt pcr analyses we only detected the gene which was up regulated in the mutant among the three genes near to the t dna insertion site . these results suggested that the activated gene was tightly linked with the mutant phenotype . the gene was therefore designated as . to gain insight into the function of the gene we attempted to isolate this gene in arabidopsis . the isolated cdna sequence comprised bp and harbored one single orf encoding a protein of amino acids with a calculated mol . wt of kda which displayed identity with unknown proteins in camelina sativa capsella rubella brassica rapa and eutrema salsugineum . blast analysis revealed the presence of only a single copy of the gene in the arabidopsis genome . based on its amino acid sequence one highly conserved serine rich domain in the central region was identified in the homologous proteins although no function was assigned to this region . alignment of the full length deduced amino acid sequences of and orthologs from different phylogenetic origins . shown are the sequences of camelina sativa camelina sativa camelina sativa capsella rubella brassica rapa and eutrema salsugineum . black and gray shading indicate identical and similar amino acids respectively . gaps were used to optimize the alignment . phylogenetic tree depicting homology relationships among arabidopsis thaliana c. sativa c. rubella b. rapa and e. salsugineum members . numbers at branch points indicate bootstrap values after replications . the structure of the conserved regions of the protein . the primary structure contains a serine rich box within its central region which is indicated by the gray box . to demonstrate that activated is responsible for the mutant phenotype full length cdna under the control of the camv promoter was transferred into the _PROTEIN_ mutant . fourteen homozygous lines were obtained and two lines exhibiting high levels of transgene _PROTEIN_ were selected for phenotypic characterization . comparison of the and transgenic plants with the _PROTEIN_ mutant demonstrated significantly fewer expanded and green cotyledons and days after germination when grown on _METHOD_ medium containing mm mannitol peg or aba . conversely the cotyledon greening rate was similar between and and transgenic plants . taken together our results demonstrated that overexpression of the gene was able to suppress the dehydration and aba insensitive phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . we also examined the accumulation of pro in complementation lines under mm mannitol peg and drought conditions . as shown in supplementary fig . pro accumulation in the complementation lines was similar under dehydration conditions compared with the wt and but was significantly lower compared with the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the magnitude of pro induction of drought conditions in _PROTEIN_ was greater than that of mannitol and peg conditions while induction of pro in response to mannitol was similar with that of peg treatment . the complementation results demonstrate that the overexpression of in the _PROTEIN_ line is responsible for the dehydration and aba sensitivity of the mutant . mannitol peg and aba sensitivity as a result of overexpression in _PROTEIN_ mutants . the effects of mannitol peg and aba treatment on cotyledon greening . seeds were sown on _METHOD_ agar plates supplemented with mm mannitol peg or aba and permitted to grow for and days after germination . seedlings with green cotyledons were counted . _LOCATION_ bars represent the sd . differences between wild type and transgenic plants grown under the same conditions are significant at > p > or p < . previous studies showed increases in the mda content in plants subjected to drought stress . to investigate the effect of drought stress on lipid peroxidation we measured the mda content in wt _PROTEIN_ and complementation lines . as shown in supplementary fig . the mda contents did not differ substantially among the wt _PROTEIN_ and complementation lines under normal conditions . the mda content in all the plants was raised by drought stress . the mda level in _PROTEIN_ was lowerthan that in the wt whereas and complementation lines displayed significantly higher mda contents than the wt after drought stress . thus is involved in the production of lipid peroxidation by drought stress . to investigate the function of we initially assessed its _PROTEIN_ pattern . the results of qpcr experiments demonstrated that was _PROTEIN_ relatively strongly in flowers weakly in roots and very weakly in rosette leaves and _METHOD_ . next in an effort to determine the in vivo functions of we assessed the accumulation of rna in arabidopsis seedlings subjected to mannitol peg drought and aba treatment using qpcr . as shown in was reduced significantly in day old arabidopsis seedlings within h of mannitol peg or aba treatment . samples subjected to drought stress also showed a significant reduction in _PROTEIN_ in whole plants of day old seedlings . _PROTEIN_ was reduced under abiotic stress in contrast to _PROTEIN_ of the control _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes which was induced strongly . _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis plants grown under abiotic stress conditions . qpcr analyses showing the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in response to abiotic stress conditions . all quantifications were made in three independent rna samples obtained from plants treated with mm mannitol peg drought and aba for the indicated times . _LOCATION_ bars indicate the sd of three independent biological samples . differences among the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis seedlings with and without treatment with various abiotic stresses are significant at > p > or p < . to assess the subcellular localization of a camv promoter driven fusion gene _METHOD_ from cdna was constitutively _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . using phosphinothricin resistance segregation we selected homozygous plants for _METHOD_ . the _METHOD_ of the _METHOD_ construct was found to be quite strong in the cytoplasm of the root cells in transgenic seedlings . cytoplasmic localization of . five day old transgenic plants grown on half strength _METHOD_ agar medium were analyzed for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ by confocal microscopy . the _METHOD_ signal was _PROTEIN_ observed in the cytoplasm of the root cells . _METHOD_ green _METHOD_ protein b/w black and white . scale bars . to investigate the in vivo function of overexpression was induced in arabidopsis under the control of the promoter . eleven homozygous lines were obtained and two lines exhibiting high levels of transgene _PROTEIN_ were selected for phenotypic characterization . in an effort to evaluate further the functional consequence of the loss of rnai lines were generated using full length cdna sequences . _PROTEIN_ was assessed by rt pcr in two randomly selected independent lines . _PROTEIN_ was knocked down in the rnai lines and the effects of mannitol peg and aba on cotyledon greening efficiency in the transgenic lines were tested . seeds of wt and overexpressing plants were grown on sterile medium containing mm mannitol peg or aba . the percentage of germinated seeds was calculated from the number of seedlings with cotyledon greening and dag . wt and overexpressing seeds germinated almost evenly under normal conditions however in the presence of mm mannitol of the wt seeds and only of the overexpressing seeds germinated for dag . in contrast of the seeds germinated in the presence of mannitol . at peg of overexpressing seeds germinated for dag while this increased to and for wt and rnai seeds respectively . when permitted to grow for dag prior to the assessment of cotyledon greening rates in the overexpressing plants in response to aba of the wt leaves expanded and turned green as compared with in the lines . conversely of two overexpressing transgenic lines survived dag . these results show that lines are more likely to be insensitive to dehydration and aba stresses than the wt . however the overexpressing plants were shown to be more sensitive to dehydration stress and aba than the wt and plants . abiotic stress sensitivity of transgenic plants . effect of mannitol peg and aba treatment on cotyledon greening . seeds were sown on _METHOD_ agar plates supplemented with mm mannitol peg or aba and were permitted to grow for and days after germination . seedlings with green cotyledons were counted . _LOCATION_ bars represent the sd . differences between wt and transgenic plants grown under the same conditions are significant at > p > or p < . pro content in different lines was also determined . under normal unstressed conditions the pro content was similar in all lines . during drought stress conditions a significant increase in pro content was observed in lines but the _PROTEIN_ was more marked in overexpressing transgenic lines than in the wt . these results indicate that disruption of _PROTEIN_ promotes pro accumulation . because transcripts accumulate at high levels especially in flower organs it would be interesting to evaluate whether is associated with pollen tube growth . several papers also reported that pro is considered an important flowering signal during pollen tube germination and fertilization because it accumulates markedly in reproductive tissues . to determine whether is associated with pollen tube growth we measured pollen tubes in vitro after h pollen germination . as shown in and supplementary fig . pollen tubes were shorter than wt and _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes . however the average length of _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes was longer than that of the wt pollen tubes . the _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes were similar in appearance to pollen tubes . quantification of the lengths of wt and overexpressing pollen tubes revealed a significant difference in their length . pollen from both overexpressing lines formed relatively short pollen tubes . from this we concluded that can regulate the length of pollen tubes . length of in vitro grown wt _PROTEIN_ and transgenic pollen tubes . after h pollen germination the lengths of pollen tubes from each line were measured . and overexpressing pollen tubes were significantly shorter than wt _PROTEIN_ and pollen tubes . _LOCATION_ bars represent the sd . differences among wt _PROTEIN_ overexpressing and lines grown under the same conditions are significant at > p > or p < .

activation tagged transgenic _PROTEIN_ mutants were selected by spraying _PROTEIN_ once every d for weeks and were visually inspected to identify plants exhibiting wt like morphology . we selected _PROTEIN_ resistant generation lines . because _PROTEIN_ is known for the hyperaccumulation of pro in response to water deficit conditions the population was screened for _PROTEIN_ pro concentration to drought stress compared with the _PROTEIN_ mutant . to isolate pca mutants the pattern of pro accumulation was initially assessed in excised leaves from week old plants and _PROTEIN_ mutants subjected to drought induced pro accumulation following d drought . nine putative suppressor mutants were identified in the first screen and were grown to produce seeds . _PROTEIN_ resistance in generation plants from selected suppressor mutants segregated as a single locus . then seeds of putative suppressors were sown on dehydration medium to confirm the sensitive phenotype . after analyses

in a boiling water bath and then quickly cooled on ice . the absorbance of the colored supernatant was measured at nm and was corrected for non specific absorbance at nm and nm . the mda content was calculated with the equation mda . for relative water content values detached rosette leaves were placed on open lid petri dishes at room temperature with humidity under dim light . the weights of

thermal asymmetric interlaced pcr was performed using arbitrary degenerate and t dna left border end primers . purified fragments following _PROTEIN_ tail pcr were cloned into the pgem t easy vector for dna sequence analysis and the flanking sequences obtained were used to perform a blast search using the ncbi program . finally specific primers were designed and used in combination with the t dna lb primer to amplify specific fragments which were subsequently sequenced to confirm the t dna insertion site . total rna was isolated from arabidopsis leaves using _PROTEIN_ reagent . to construct the overexpression lines the full length cdna was amplified using rt pcr and the generated product was cloned into the pdonr/zeo vector for dna sequence analysis . the rt pcr primers were as follows forward ggggacaagttt _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ aagaggagagagttgg and reverse ggggaccac tttgtacaaga aagctgggt cacaaaggcaa ccacaacatctct . amplification proceeded for cycles consisting of for s for s and for min . the pcr amplified products were then directionally cloned into the plant _PROTEIN_ vector . the resultant construct was introduced into agrobacterium tumefaciens strain and the _PROTEIN_ mutant
