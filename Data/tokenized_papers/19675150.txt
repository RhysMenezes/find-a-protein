widespread antibiotic resistance is a major public health concern and plants represent an emerging antibiotic exposure route . recent studies indicate that crop plants fertilized with antibiotic laden animal manure accumulate antibiotics however the molecular _METHOD_ of antibiotic entry and subcellular partitioning within plant cells remain unknown . here we report that mutations in the arabidopsis locus multiple antibiotic confer resistance while overexpression causes hypersensitivity to multiple aminoglycoside antibiotics . additionally yeast _PROTEIN_ are hypersensitive to the aminoglycoside _PROTEIN_ . encodes a protein with putative transmembrane domains with low similarity to from danio rerio . a yellow _METHOD_ protein fusion localizes to the chloroplast and chloroplasts from plants overexpressing accumulate more of the aminoglycoside gentamicin while mutant chloroplasts accumulate less than the wild type . overexpression lines are slightly chlorotic and chlorosis is rescued by exogenous iron . _PROTEIN_ is also down regulated by low iron . these data suggest that is a _LOCATION_ transporter that is likely to be involved in cellular iron homeostasis and allows opportunistic entry of multiple antibiotics into the chloroplast .
was generated via ethyl methanesulfonate _METHOD_ mutagenesis and was found to be resistant to several aminoglycoside antibiotics including kanamycin streptomycin gentamicin amikacin tobramycin and apramycin . interestingly was not found to be resistant to the aminoglycosides hygromycin _PROTEIN_ or paromomycin . these compounds while structurally similar to other aminoglycosides are distinct in that they inhibit both prokaryotic and eukaryotic protein synthesis . no resistance was found to antibiotics of other classes including spectinomycin tetracycline chloramphenicol and lincomycin . each of these antibiotics target prokaryotic translational machinery but are structurally distinct from the aminoglycosides . a backcross of to the wild type revealed that the mutation is _LOCATION_ and monogenic . the mutant locus was isolated via map based cloning . a single nucleotide change was found in the exon of the locus _GENE_ which is annotated as having low similarity to from danio rerio . _GENE_ has been described as _PROTEIN_ based on sequence similarity to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ two iron regulated transporters in arabidopsis . more recently it has been described as _PROTEIN_ and two mutations in the gene _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were shown to confer kanamycin resistance at mg/l . native _PROTEIN_ of _GENE_ was able to complement the mutant . here we will refer to _GENE_ as since the gene name _PROTEIN_ does not accurately describe the functionalities we have uncovered for _GENE_ . the single nucleotide change in leads to a single amino acid change at position in the protein . this particular ala residue lies in the middle of a putative transmembrane domain of the protein and is highly conserved among homologs . as mentioned earlier has only two homologs in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . however there are three homologs in rice and two homologs in grape . is more closely related to rice homologs that are predicted to be chloroplast localized and to its grape homolog that is predicted to function in secretory pathways . this could indicate that the protein may localize to an intracellular compartment as opposed to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of the cell . we obtained two t dna insertion lines for from the arabidopsis biological resource center . we have designated as and as . both lines show an extreme reduction in transcript as measured by quantitative real time pcr and both were found to be nearly phenotypically identical to with respect to antibiotic resistance . note that salk lines are expected to be kanamycin and paromomycin resistant due to _PROTEIN_ of nptii but this does not lead to cross resistance to other antibiotics as illustrated by an unrelated kanamycin resistant nptii _PROTEIN_ salk insertion line . since the t dna insertion lines and phenocopy the _METHOD_ mutant and all mutations confer multiple antibiotic resistance we hypothesized that overexpressing would lead to the opposite phenotype hypersensitivity to multiple antibiotics . we _PROTEIN_ the genomic locus from start to stop codon under control of the promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus in wild type plants and found that it did confer a phenotype of hypersensitivity to both kanamycin and gentamicin based on severe chlorosis and stunted growth of seedlings . _PROTEIN_ in two independent overexpression lines was found to be at least fold higher than the wild type . to further confirm that mutations in _GENE_ are responsible for the phenotype of we _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ in the background . analysis of several independent transgenic lines revealed that this construct led to a reversal of the kanamycin resistance phenotype of i.e . mutant plants overexpressing were found to be hypersensitive to kanamycin . additionally native _PROTEIN_ of in a background reverted the phenotype back to approximately wild type levels of resistance . the _PROTEIN_ plant _LOCATION_ protein database uses data from individual _METHOD_ to arrive at a consensus prediction for subcellular location . this consensus prediction method predicts that the protein is targeted to the chloroplast . according to the chlorop program the predicted chloroplast transit peptide of includes the first amino acids of the protein . a c terminal yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion to the putative transit peptide of was transiently _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts . chloroplast transit peptides are known to effectively mediate transport across the chloroplast _LOCATION_ so the expected localization of _METHOD_ fused to a transit peptide would be the stroma . this is what was observed in our experiment based on distinct _METHOD_ colocalization with red _METHOD_ chloroplasts . c terminal and n terminal translational fusions between full length cdna and _METHOD_ were also _PROTEIN_ . in c terminal fusions _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was clearly associated with chloroplasts and in n terminal fusions _METHOD_ was cytoplasmic . the _METHOD_ c terminal translational fusion described above was also used to transform plants . _PROTEIN_ of this fusion protein was able to complement the resistance phenotype of . leaves of these plants were examined by confocal microscopy and compared to untransformed controls . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in transformed lines colocalized with chloroplast _METHOD_ and appeared particularly enhanced at the periphery of these organelles indicating that may be associated with the chloroplast envelope . to further test the function of the putative transport protein we _PROTEIN_ this protein in the yeast strain under control of the strong _PROTEIN_ promoter . both wild type and mutant alleles were used for these experiments . was used because it is only slightly sensitive to the aminoglycoside _PROTEIN_ . yeast _PROTEIN_ wild type were found to be hypersensitive to _PROTEIN_ when compared to empty vector controls . interestingly yeast _PROTEIN_ the mutant allele were also hypersensitive but to a lesser extent than the yeast . to eliminate the possibility that hypersensitivity was due to a general toxicity effect the experiment was repeated using varying concentrations of cycloheximide which is highly toxic to yeast . no growth differences were seen at any cycloheximide concentration among yeast _PROTEIN_ either or empty vector controls . to ensure that protein was being properly _PROTEIN_ and to determine its localization pattern in yeast we also _PROTEIN_ a _METHOD_ tagged version of . yeast _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were hypersensitive to _PROTEIN_ indicating functionality of the fusion protein . while _METHOD_ alone was clearly cytoplasmic _METHOD_ tagged localized to the yeast mitochondria which is typical for chloroplast _LOCATION_ proteins _PROTEIN_ in yeast . since the aminoglycoside _PROTEIN_ acts on both prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes _PROTEIN_ is likely to be inhibiting yeast growth in _PROTEIN_ strains by accumulating in mitochondria . since was found to localize to the yeast mitochondria we did an additional control using chloramphenicol which is known to inhibit yeast mitochondrial translation . we did not find resistance to chloramphenicol in or mutant plants therefore it is not likely to be a substrate for the transporter . in support of this we did not observe major growth differences between yeast lines _PROTEIN_ and empty vector controls when grown for h in the presence of or mg/ml chloramphenicol . since appeared to be a chloroplast localized transport protein and its disruption and overexpression caused antibiotic resistance and hypersensitivity respectively we decided to test its functionality as a transporter for antibiotics . to accomplish this we developed both a short term uptake assay using isolated chloroplasts and a longer term uptake assay using whole seedlings . for short term uptake isolated chloroplasts were exposed to high levels of antibiotic for short periods of time . for longer term uptake whole seedlings were exposed to lower levels of antibiotic for d . excess antibiotic was washed away and chloroplasts were lysed to release their antibiotic content . lysates were then spotted onto nitrocellulose in dot blot fashion along with gentamicin standards and gentamicin was detected via anti gentamicin antibody . this allowed for a simple yet quantitative method for measuring the gentamicin content of chloroplasts each dot was analyzed using the integrated density function of to determine a relative intensity value which correlated positively with the amount of antibiotic in the lysate . in short term uptake experiments with isolated chloroplasts it was found that chloroplasts from mutant plants accumulated less gentamicin than wild type _LOCATION_ controls while chloroplasts from overexpressors accumulated the most gentamicin . this experiment was performed a total of three independent times with the same result . in uptake experiments using whole seedlings it was found that chloroplasts from and mutant seedlings accumulated less gentamicin than the wild type control . evidence from these experiments demonstrates the role of as a chloroplast associated transporter that is capable of importing aminoglycoside antibiotic . it is unlikely that evolutionary pressures would have selected for a means of entry for toxic antibiotics into plant chloroplasts . therefore we propose that has a more conventional role in the plant and the transport of antibiotics is an opportunistic effect . the _PROTEIN_ pattern of does not yield many clues as to its potential function . promoter reporter fusion experiments using transgenic plants demonstrated that is _PROTEIN_ throughout the plant body in young seedlings . in addition appears to be fairly evenly _PROTEIN_ in most tissue types based on atgenexpress data . given its sequence similarity to ferroportin it is possible that could be involved in some aspect of iron transport . in an attempt to test this possibility we _PROTEIN_ cdna in the yeast double mutant which is defective in low and high affinity iron uptake . we found that _PROTEIN_ in vector was unable to complement on sd media or . this result is probably not surprising given 's localization to the yeast mitochondria . a common symptom of iron deficiency in plants is chlorosis since iron is essential for chlorophyll biosynthesis . interestingly we observed a visible and quantifiable phenotype of chlorosis in seedlings when grown for weeks on plain murashige and skoog _METHOD_ media or _METHOD_ media supplemented with fe edta . additionally when plants were grown in soil they appeared slightly more chlorotic than the wild type both in leaves and _METHOD_ . chlorosis was especially prominent along the midvein and older areas of cauline leaves which also displayed an altered leaf shape pinched toward the tip compared to ler . chlorosis of plate grown seedlings persisted until media was supplemented with fe edta . our results suggest that the overexpression of creates an iron limiting condition for the plant . one of the homologs in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ was found to be up regulated under iron deficiency . with this in _PROTEIN_ we examined for transcriptional changes under iron limitation and iron excess . plants were grown in liquid culture for d and baseline tissue samples were taken before addition of either fe edta or ferrozine . we observed a _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ after d of growth under iron deficiency along with the expected up regulation of iron regulated _PROTEIN_ under similar conditions . we also observed a down regulation of when plants were grown for weeks on plates containing a lower concentration of ferrozine . a subsequent increase in transcription was not observed when iron levels were elevated for d despite the expected down regulation of _PROTEIN_ under these conditions . because the chlorosis of can be rescued by excess iron and is down regulated under limiting iron conditions we postulate that may play a role in iron chelation storage or sequestration .

screen was performed to try to identify components of the dna methylation pathway . however the t dna containing the silenced nptii gene segregates away from the locus . the original line was
