phytohormone abscisic acid regulates many aspects of plant development and growth . to explore the molecular mechanism of aba we identified the novel aba regulated genes in arabidopsis thaliana by searching for genes possessing two or more _PROTEIN_ . one of these genes two or more _PROTEIN_ containing gene _PROTEIN_ is highly induced by aba and nacl . database searches revealed that _PROTEIN_ encodes a protein with no domains of known function . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein in arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts indicated that _PROTEIN_ is targeted to the _LOCATION_ . although the gene has a basal level of _PROTEIN_ in various arabidopsis organs/tissues except for adult leaves a high _PROTEIN_ level was detected in roots . constitutive overexpression of _PROTEIN_ in plants resulted in the insensitivity to aba and nacl suggesting that _PROTEIN_ plays a negative role in aba and salt stress responses . furthermore _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants exhibited the short roots _PROTEIN_ flowering and starch excess phenotypes . rt pcr analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of two floral and one starch degradation related genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively may lead to altered phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants . taken together our data reveal that _PROTEIN_ acts in the _LOCATION_ and is an important negative regulator of aba and salt stress responses and could play a critical role in controlling root elongation floral initiation and starch degradation .
to facilitate the genetic analysis of the aba response we have identified novel aba regulated genes using an in silico method by searching for genes possessing two more _PROTEIN_ within the promoter region in arabidopsis . one of these genes _PROTEIN_ in the locus _GENE_ contains three _PROTEIN_ within the bp region upstream of the translation start site . to examine whether _PROTEIN_ was up regulated by aba or abiotic stress northern blot assay was performed with the week old seedlings treated with aba or abiotic stress . the transcript accumulation of _PROTEIN_ under aba and salt treatments was higher than that with mock treatment while the level of _PROTEIN_ transcript in response to peg and cold treatments was less than that of the control . comparison of cdna and genomic dna sequences indicated that _PROTEIN_ is an intron less gene . the gene revealed an open reading frame encoding for a amino acid protein with a calculated molecular _METHOD_ of kda and _PROTEIN_ . southern blot hybridization revealed that _PROTEIN_ is a single copy gene . a blast search revealed that _PROTEIN_ has identity and similarity to arabidopsis _METHOD_ protein . _PROTEIN_ also shows a high degree of similarity to three unknown proteins _GENE_ _GENE_ and . although these proteins differ in length all share conserved sequences at the n and c termini . furthermore a search with use of the program pfam revealed no domains of known function in _PROTEIN_ . to examine the tissue _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis northern blot analysis was performed with total rna extracted from various tissues . the level of _PROTEIN_ transcript was high in seedlings and roots but lower in dry seeds flowers and siliques and barely detectable in rosette leaves of adult plants . to determine the spatial and temporal _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ more precisely the _PROTEIN_ promoter was fused to a reporter gene encoding _PROTEIN_ to generate _PROTEIN_ gus which was introduced into the wild type plants through agrobacterium mediated transformation . gus staining was readily visible in the leaves of seedlings root tip junction of primary and _PROTEIN_ roots filaments of opened flowers and junction of siliques and pedicels but barely detectable in rosette leaves of adult plants . after aba treatment gus activity was greatly increased in leaves and roots . these results are consistent with those of northern blot analysis of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in various tissues . to determine the subcellur localization of _PROTEIN_ protein in arabidopsis we amplified _PROTEIN_ full length cdna by rt pcr and fused it with _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which was introduced into arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts by peg mediated transfection . bright green _METHOD_ was detected in the _LOCATION_ of protoplasts after h of incubation which implies that _PROTEIN_ localizes to the _LOCATION_ . to functionally analyze the role of _PROTEIN_ in planta we used overexpression and rnai mediated suppression approaches to generate _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ rnai transgenic plants . rt pcr analysis showed that the _PROTEIN_ transcripts at the highest level in the independent _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines harvested at weeks . furthermore comparison of wild type with rnai transgenic plants the marked reduction of _PROTEIN_ transcript was observed in the rnai transgenic lines with or without aba treatment . we used the generation of these transgenic plants for further analyses . previous reports have demonstrated that high concentrations of aba or nacl inhibit the germination and growth of wild type seeds . to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ plays a role in the seed germination response to aba and nacl seeds of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ rnai and wild type plants were incubated on medium supplemented with aba or nacl . compared to wild type seeds the _PROTEIN_ transgenic seeds were more insensitive to inhibition of germination by aba especially at aba . at aba or above seed germination of the wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ rnai seeds was greatly inhibited with less clear differences in germination . the _PROTEIN_ transgenic seeds were also more resistant to nacl treatment than wild type and _PROTEIN_ rnai transgenic seeds . thus _PROTEIN_ modulates the responses of aba and nacl in germination . we next investigated the effects of _PROTEIN_ on aba induced stomatal closing and senescence as well as salt tolerance to confirm the roles of _PROTEIN_ in aba and nacl signaling . the stomatal closure in _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants was less sensitive to aba than _PROTEIN_ rnai and wild type plants at and aba . additionally fig . shows that the aba induced senescence of detached leaves was impaired in _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants . for salt tolerance assay _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ rnai transgenic and wild type seeds were plated on the half strength _METHOD_ medium containing nacl in the range from mm to mm and grown for days . as shown in fig . constitutive overexpression of _PROTEIN_ severely reduced the salt tolerance approximately wild type and _PROTEIN_ rnai transgenic plants survived in the medium plus mm nacl whereas only of _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants survived . all the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ rnai transgenic and wild type plants had a survival rate when they were not treated with nacl . we next examined the effect of _PROTEIN_ on aba induced gene _PROTEIN_ . surprisingly rt pcr analyses showed _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants with a markedly _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ of two aba induced genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as compared to wild type plants under aba treatment . since _PROTEIN_ was highly _PROTEIN_ in roots we further examined the effect of _PROTEIN_ on root development . the root length of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ rnai transgenic plants was compared with that of wild type plants . as shown in fig . the primary root length of tmac transgenic plants was markedly shorter than that of wild type plants while the length of _PROTEIN_ rnai transgenic plants was similar to that of wild type plants . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ overexpression affects the function of aba on root elongation day old seedlings were grown on the medium with or without aba for days . after aba treatment the root growth of wild type and _PROTEIN_ rnai transgenic plants were significantly inhibited . interestingly the primary root length of _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants on the medium containing or aba were longer than those on aba free medium and wild type and _PROTEIN_ rnai transgenic plants on aba containing medium . these results indicated that _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants exhibited insensitivity to the aba mediated inhibition of root elongation . to assess the role of _PROTEIN_ in growth and development wild type _PROTEIN_ overexpressing and rnai transgenic plants were grown under long day conditions and the time of flowering was recorded as the number of rosette leaves present upon the first appearance of flower buds . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ rnai transgenic plants flowered days and days on average respectively after imbibition as compared with days on average for wild type plants . consistent with the _PROTEIN_ flowering phenotype the rosette leaf number produced by _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants was greater than that in _PROTEIN_ rmai transgenic and wild type plants . to clarify the molecular basis of the altered flowering phenotype we examined the _PROTEIN_ of flowering related genes in _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants . genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have been reported to be involved in floral initiation in arabidopsis . the rt pcr analysis showed that the levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were lower in both _PROTEIN_ independent lines than in wild type plants . these results suggest that the alteration of flowering time observed in _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants is associated with the downregulation of these genes . since the _PROTEIN_ transcript was _PROTEIN_ detected in the veins of leaves we examined whether _PROTEIN_ plays a role in _PROTEIN_ metabolism . we determined the starch content in leaves because starch is the major source of _PROTEIN_ and the principal way plants store energy . after days of germination on half strength _METHOD_ medium the starch of seedlings was stained with iodine after the dark photoperiod . surprisingly the leaves of _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants were stained darker than those of wild type and _PROTEIN_ rnai transgenic plants . figure shows the starch content of _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants being about fold more than that of wild type and _PROTEIN_ rnai transgenic plants . gene _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is known to be a general regulator of starch degradation in arabidopsis therefore we checked the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants . rt pcr analysis showed that the level of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was reduced in _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants . starch is an important source of _PROTEIN_ and breakdown of starch provides the energy for plant growth and avoidance of sugar starvation . since _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants showed an impaired ability to degrade starch we further examined the _PROTEIN_ of two sugar starvation induced genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . as shown in fig . the level of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was significantly up regulated in _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants .

_PROTEIN_ ttacgtcacacccatcttccac _PROTEIN_ ggacatcggaaaggtcttgg caattaccatccaaagcccatc . the arabidopsis was amplified using primers ctaagctctcaagatcaaaggctta and ttaacattgcaaagagtttcaaggt and used as an internal control . the overexpression and rnai constructs were made in a binary vector gusless modified from vector and without the gus gene . to generate the overexpression construct of the _PROTEIN_ coding region _PROTEIN_ full length cdna was generated by rt pcr with the following primers having a bglii site _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the pcr product was confirmed by dna sequencing and subsequently cloned into the bamhi site of modified binary vector gusless under the control of the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus promoter to generate _PROTEIN_ . to construct rnai transgenic lines of _PROTEIN_ a sali bglii fragment from _PROTEIN_ full length cdna was fused with a bamhi bglii spacer fragment from plasmid pseap basic and cloned into the sali site of gusless to create an inverted repeat construct . for generation of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion the kb promoter region of _PROTEIN_ was fused to a gus gene . the promoter was obtained by pcr from the genomic dna with the following primers forward primer with hindiii aagcttccaacaaagcagaaacagccc and reverse primer with bamhi ggatccttcccctgcctcttatcatctcc . the promoter sequence was confirmed by dna sequencing and cloned into a binary vector between the hindiii and bamhi sites . these constructs were introduced into agrobacterium tumefaciens strain and then transformed into arabidopsis plants according to the floral dip method . transgenic lines transformed with these constructs were selected with use of kanamycin . selected plants were propagated by self pollination to obtain homozygous generation plants . histochemical gus staining was performed as previously described . briefly seedlings treated with aba and various tissues of _PROTEIN_ gus transgenic plants were incubated in staining buffer

by dna sequencing and cloned into the bamhi site of a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ vector _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to create the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion was introduced into arabidopsis protoplasts by peg mediated transfection . stomatal apertures were measured as described previously by kwak et al . . leaves of week old plants were incubated in stomatal opening buffer
