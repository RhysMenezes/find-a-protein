the present study identified a family of six a. thaliana genes that share five limited regions of sequence similarity with _PROTEIN_ a gene in oryza sativa shown to participate in the early gravity signaling for shoot gravitropism . a t dna insertion into the arabidopsis gene most similar to _PROTEIN_ increased the inflorescence branch angle to from the wild type value of . rna interference lines and molecular rescue experiments confirmed the linkage between the branch angle phenotype and the gene consequently named _PROTEIN_ . time resolved gravitropism measurements of _PROTEIN_ hypocotyls and primary inflorescence _METHOD_ showed a significantly reduced bending rate during the first hour of response . the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ protein was investigated to determine if the _LOCATION_ localization predicted from the gene sequence was observable and important to its function in shoot gravity responses . _PROTEIN_ fused to green _METHOD_ protein largely rescued the branch angle phenotype of _PROTEIN_ and was observed by confocal microscopy at the cell periphery and within the _LOCATION_ . mutation of the _LOCATION_ localization signal prevented detectable levels of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ without affecting the ability of the gene to rescue the _PROTEIN_ branch angle phenotype . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ functions in gravity signaling during shoot gravitropism being a functional ortholog of rice _PROTEIN_ . the _LOCATION_ pool of the protein appears to be unnecessary for this function which instead relies on a pool that appears to reside at the cell periphery .
a previous study identified an arabidopsis gene with some sequence similarity to the rice gene _PROTEIN_ . an alignment of _PROTEIN_ and _GENE_ showed where these limited regions of similarity occur . iterative database searches using each round of results as the next round of queries identified five regions of conservation that defined a family of six _PROTEIN_ like genes in arabidopsis which had similar predicted genomic structures . the only functional domains inferred from the sequence analysis of _GENE_ were _LOCATION_ localization signals located between regions iii and iv and an ear motif located in the conserved region v. two partially overlapping nlss were predicted separately by predictnls and cnls mapper . ear motifs are often found in transcription regulators and in many cases function as repressors . therefore the predicted occurrence of an ear motif could suggest a _LOCATION_ localized function of the product of _GENE_ . pairwise alignment showed that _GENE_ is the arabidopsis gene most closely related to _PROTEIN_ . considering this sequence similarity and the results to be described the gene is hereafter referred to as _PROTEIN_ . protein sequences and the unique identifiers for each arabidopsis protein were obtained from the tair website . pairwise alignment score between each homolog and rice _PROTEIN_ obtained using t _PROTEIN_ . this homolog was named _PROTEIN_ on the basis of the sequence similarity to _PROTEIN_ and the results obtained in this study . the _PROTEIN_ and enhanced green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ reporters were introduced into wild type plants under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter to investigate the natural _PROTEIN_ pattern of the gene . the gus activity was largely restricted to the shoot in dark or light grown seedlings . staining was observed around the shoot apical meristem and vascular tissues . the tissue stained around vascular tissue was the stele apparently including the endodermis . similar _PROTEIN_ patterns were displayed by the _METHOD_ transgenic plants . etiolated seedlings showed signal in the hypocotyl central cylinder and apical hook as well as the cotyledon petioles and blades . the upper portion of the inflorescence stem stained well . the shoot specificity of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is shared by _PROTEIN_ . the possible function of _PROTEIN_ on shoot gravitropism was investigated by genetically manipulating its _PROTEIN_ through t dna insertion and rna interference . a plant containing a t dna insertion immediately following the start codon was obtained . the mrna _PROTEIN_ in this t dna inserted _PROTEIN_ was converted to cdna by rapid amplification of cdna ends _PROTEIN_ and sequenced . as shown in figure a deletion spanning the first exon/intron boundary resulted in a transcript composed of the first proper amino acid followed by what would normally be an intron sequence . if a protein were to be made from this over _PROTEIN_ mutant mrna it would be an n terminal truncated protein . the t dna insertion mutant allele is hereafter called _PROTEIN_ . quantitative reverse transcription pcr was performed on extracts of light grown seedlings . as compared with _PROTEIN_ of the wild type the mutated gene was over _PROTEIN_ approximately fold higher probably because of the camv promoter located at the right border of the t dna sequence . we also produced transgenic lines carrying an _PROTEIN_ rnai construct . two of those _PROTEIN_ rnai lines _PROTEIN_ in which _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was suppressed by approximately were used for further analysis . phenotype analyses of this allele and independent _PROTEIN_ rnai lines and rescue of the phenotype with _PROTEIN_ genomic dna indicate that _PROTEIN_ can be considered a recessive loss of function mutant . the most apparent and striking feature of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ rnai plants was a large declination of their branches . many branches were nearly horizontal in the mutant and sometimes it adopted a nearly prostrate growth habit reminiscent of rice _PROTEIN_ mutants . the plants also tended to tilt their _PROTEIN_ shoots . when the branch orientation was quantified in _METHOD_ of the branch angle illustrated in figure wild type plants had branch angles of about whereas _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ rnai plants had branch angles of about . apart from the inflorescence morphology the adult _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ rnai plants appeared normal . the probability that the branch orientation phenotype was caused by the reduced gravitropic responsiveness of the mutant branches was tested by inverting plants with a first branch of approximately cm in length . the light source was placed under the plants after inversion to _PROTEIN_ the original illumination conditions . as shown in figure the _PROTEIN_ stem and branches of wild type plants curved upwards in response to reorientation but _PROTEIN_ plants did not . thus the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype is explained by impaired negative shoot gravitropism . to further investigate the role played by _PROTEIN_ in shoot gravitropism the gravitropic response of hypocotyls in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ rnai lines was compared with the wild type . digital images of etiolated hypocotyls were automatically collected in complete darkness at min intervals after rotation using infrared sensitive charge coupled device cameras . analysis was performed with the hypotrace computer program as previously described for phototropism . figure shows that _PROTEIN_ and the two _PROTEIN_ rnai lines described in figure responded more weakly than the wild type . the first derivative of the time courses in figure showed that the _PROTEIN_ difference between the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ rnai lines was slower bending during the initial hour of the gravitropic response in which the most rapid bending occurred in the wild type . this was not caused by any difference in growth rate because two of the three _PROTEIN_ lines grew at the wild type rate during the bending response . instead the data in figure indicated that _PROTEIN_ affects the magnitude of the growth differential across the hypocotyl during the early stage of gravitropism . inflorescence _METHOD_ were also subjected to gravistimulation and the response was measured in this case manually from time series of digital images . as in hypocotyls _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ rnai lines responded slower than the wild type during the early phase of curvature development . the first derivative analyses showed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ rnai lines differed from the wild type within the first h of the gravitropic response the period in which the most rapid bending occurred in the wild type . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ rnai lines also lacked the transient overshooting of the final angle displayed by the wild type . impaired hypocotyl gravitropism in the _PROTEIN_ lines is similar to the _PROTEIN_ coleoptile gravitropism phenotype . as rice _PROTEIN_ was found to be essential for coleoptile circumnutation a role for _PROTEIN_ in circumnutation of hypocotyls and inflorescence _METHOD_ was investigated . hypocotyl circumnutation enhanced by treatment with the ethylene precursor aminocyclopropane _PROTEIN_ acid was measured with the hypotrace tool . wild type and _PROTEIN_ hypocotyls began to nutate similarly approximately h after treatment with acc . thus _PROTEIN_ may not function in hypocotyl circumnutation . circumnutation of wild type inflorescence _METHOD_ became pronounced in darkness as recorded by a ccd camera under infrared illumination . similar circumnutation occurred in _PROTEIN_ plants . it was difficult to make a quantitative comparison between the wild type and _PROTEIN_ because the amplitude and period of the circumnutation were variable . the results however establish that _PROTEIN_ is not essential for stem circumnutation . to gain insight into the molecular function of the _PROTEIN_ protein its subcellular localization was examined . attempts to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein with _METHOD_ fused to the amino or _PROTEIN_ termini in _PROTEIN_ plants were not successful . the phenotype was not rescued and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was not observed . next _METHOD_ was inserted between the conserved regions to avoid disturbing the function of _PROTEIN_ to produce a construct _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ construct was introduced into _PROTEIN_ and its aberrant branch angle phenotype was rescued indicating that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein is functional . unfortunately the _METHOD_ signal was too weak to study even when the native promoter was replaced with the strong promoter . therefore a transient _PROTEIN_ system based on nicotiana benthamiana leaves was employed . figure shows that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was evident at the cell periphery and co localized with the _LOCATION_ marker dye consistent with a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization . plasmolysed leaf cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed _METHOD_ in hechtian strands of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ supporting the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization of at least some of the peripheral pool of _PROTEIN_ protein . figure shows that another region of _METHOD_ signal overlapped perfectly with the _LOCATION_ marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the n. benthamiana transient _PROTEIN_ system provided clear and useful results but subcellular localization of the protein should be studied in its native context as much as possible . the _PROTEIN_ heat shock inducible promoter was useful in this _PROTEIN_ . figure shows that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ could be visualized in apical hook cells of etiolated seedlings after a h treatment of . _METHOD_ was strongest at the cell periphery . the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ signal was always present although sometimes weak . these results are consistent with the results in figure and indicate that _PROTEIN_ is localized to the periphery and to the _LOCATION_ of cells in which the protein is naturally expected . to determine whether either of the two partially overlapping _LOCATION_ localization signals predicted in the _PROTEIN_ sequence is responsible for the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ critical lysine residues within each were replaced by alanine in two different constructs figure . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were studied separately in the n. benthamiana transient _PROTEIN_ system . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized to the cell periphery which was marked by the co _PROTEIN_ pm rk _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker and to the _LOCATION_ . fortuitously pm rk also rimmed the edge of the _LOCATION_ when transiently _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana providing a useful compartment outline . signal from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was in some cases observed in _LOCATION_ outlined with pm rk although the signal seemed weaker than that produced by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . on the other hand _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was never observed in _LOCATION_ . this _LOCATION_ exclusion result was also obtained when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ seedlings were induced by heat shock . these results indicate that the mutations prevent the _LOCATION_ import predicted by the nls in _PROTEIN_ . an experiment was designed to assess how well differently localized versions of _PROTEIN_ rescued the branch angle phenotype of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ mutants were transformed with the constructs _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . plants surviving selection were grown to maturity on soil and the angles of their first and second inflorescence branches were measured . in wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants the average branch angles were and respectively and their population distributions were clearly separated . figure shows that transformation of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ shifted the distribution significantly towards the wild type distribution . the distribution was broader compared with that of wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants possibly because of variation in the chromosomal position of the transgene insertion site . transformation with _PROTEIN_ rescued the phenotype as well as _PROTEIN_ and suggested that mutations did not significantly affect this rescue . whether the mutations prevented _LOCATION_ localization in these plants could not be definitively determined because the transgene did not include _METHOD_ . the small size of the native _PROTEIN_ protein might allow its passive entrance to the _LOCATION_ . as _LOCATION_ accumulation of the _METHOD_ tagged versions of _PROTEIN_ clearly requires an intact nls _PROTEIN_ mutants were transformed with _METHOD_ fusion constructs containing or not containing the nls mutations i.e . with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ shifted the branch angle distribution towards the wild type distribution although the shift was somewhat less than that caused by _PROTEIN_ .the _METHOD_ insertion somehow negatively affected _PROTEIN_ function . as shown in figure a similar shift was observed in the plants transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . this result strongly indicates that _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ is not required for its function in the control of gravitropic branch orientation .
