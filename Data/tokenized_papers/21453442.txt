_METHOD_ reporter proteins that allow repeated switching between a _METHOD_ and a _METHOD_ state are novel tools for monitoring intracellular protein trafficking . a variant of the reversibly photoswitchable _METHOD_ protein dronpa was designed for the use in transgenic arabidopsis plants . its codon usage is also well _PROTEIN_ to the mammalian codon usage . the synthetic protein shows photochemical properties and switching behavior comparable to that of the original dronpa from pectiniidae both in vitro and in vivo . fused to the protein _PROTEIN_ under control of the endogenous _PROTEIN_ promoter localizes to cytoplasm nucleoplasm and nucleolus of transgenic arabidopsis plants . to monitor the intracellular transport dynamics of _PROTEIN_ we set up a sensitive confocal _METHOD_ microscope . _METHOD_ recovery after selective photoswitching experiments revealed that _PROTEIN_ reaches the _LOCATION_ by transport . furthermore photoactivation experiments showed that _PROTEIN_ is exported from the _LOCATION_ . thus _PROTEIN_ is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein . our results show that the _METHOD_ marker is a versatile tool to track protein transport dynamics in stably transformed plants .
a variant of the reversibly photoswitchable dronpa protein was engineered to _PROTEIN_ the codon usage for _PROTEIN_ in a. thaliana . in addition fortuitous regulatory motifs including cryptic splice signals _PROTEIN_ boxes or ribosomal entry sites were avoided . to characterize in detail the photochemical properties of the synthetic protein we purified recombinantly _PROTEIN_ from escherichia coli . the absorption spectrum of the synthetic protein has a maximum at nm . the emission spectrum recorded at an excitation wavelength of nm peaks at nm . thus the variant resembles the original dronpa protein cloned from pectiniidaecitation . the photoswitching performance of the synthetic was tested in standard quartz cuvettes . irradiation at nm quantitatively transfers to the . subsequently the solution was exposed to laser light for min applying an excitation intensity of in order to generate the _METHOD_ . the procedure was repeated several times . between each round of photoswitching the _METHOD_ emission was recorded . plotting the integrated _METHOD_ against irradiation time revealed a photoswitching of seconds . to compare this to the literature we calculated the photoswitching of the original dronpa molecule based on the data by ando et al . to be seconds at . taken together these data indicate an dependence of photoswitching and laser intensity . subsequently we determined the minimal region of a sample that could be photoswitched with our confocal setup using immobilized protein . a layer was embedded in a mowiol polymer _PROTEIN_ . using a confocal microscope a single spot was irradiated at nm with an excitation power of for seconds to transfer to the . the intensity profile of an area of surrounding the photoswitched spot was approximated by a gaussian function revealing an effective focus diameter of in _PROTEIN_ direction . this implies that a minimal region of diameter can be selectively transferred to the upon laser irradiation . selective switching such a small area is of advantage to avoid bleaching of the cytoplasm surrounding plant _LOCATION_ that are localized at the periphery of the cell . the area could afterwards be switched to the several times without significant loss in _METHOD_ intensity . thus our synthetic is ideally suited for reversible photoswitching and _METHOD_ tracking experiments in living cells . next we compared the _PROTEIN_ characteristics of the to that of the pectiniidae sequence in three different _METHOD_ . for transient _PROTEIN_ in plants both and the open reading frame with the original codon usage present in the commercial vector were placed under control of the strong constitutive camv promoter . both constructs were introduced into n. benthamiana leaves via agroinfiltration . after days _METHOD_ was recorded in native protein extracts at excitation wavelength . extracts from leaves _PROTEIN_ showed a higher _METHOD_ intensity than leaves _PROTEIN_ . furthermore an immunoblot analysis showed that protein was present at higher levels than . we note that runs at a slightly higher apparent molecular weight . this may be attributed to an unknown modification . the synthetic sequence is also closer to the codon usage of mammals than the original nucleotide sequence . thus we compared and _PROTEIN_ under control of the strong constitutive cytomegalovirus promoter in cell culture . two days after transfection of _PROTEIN_ and hela cells respectively dronpa _METHOD_ recorded in native protein extracts at excitation wavelength was higher for cells _PROTEIN_ than for cells _PROTEIN_ . furthermore protein was present at higher levels in both transfected _PROTEIN_ and hela cells compared to . these data show is transiently _PROTEIN_ at higher levels in both plants and mammalian cell lines and suggest will likely yield high _PROTEIN_ levels in transgenic plants . transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ fused to the _PROTEIN_ coding region under control of the _PROTEIN_ regions including kb of the promoter intron and and untranslated regions were generated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . as a control alone was _PROTEIN_ using the same regulatory elements _PROTEIN_ . we monitored dronpa _METHOD_ predominantly in root cells of transgenic plants because of the high _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in roots . to confirm that the signal is not because of _METHOD_ we took advantage of the photoswitching capability of . after imaging under moderate excitation conditions the intensity was increased and was switched off . upon subsequent photoactivation with nm only the _METHOD_ returns because endogenous _METHOD_ is not photoactivatable . thus the synthetic could be stably _PROTEIN_ in transgenic plants . in a recent study stable _PROTEIN_ of proteins tagged with the irreversibly photoconvertable _METHOD_ protein in transgenic arabidopsis plants was not achieved citation . in transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ alone under control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter the _METHOD_ signal was distributed between the _LOCATION_ and the cytoplasm . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants also showed _METHOD_ in both the cytoplasm and the _LOCATION_ and an additional particularly strong signal in the nucleolus . whereas nucleolar localization has not been reported for _METHOD_ driven by the camv promoter citation citation we find _METHOD_ driven by its authentic promoter and regulatory elements also in the nucleolus of transgenic plants . nucleolar localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein with its role in splicing regulation is corroborated by the _PROTEIN_ that the nucleolus in addition to its traditional role in rrna biogenesis is engaged in rnp assembly mrna export and decay citation . to test whether _PROTEIN_ remains functional when fused to the chimeric _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ construct was transformed into the insertion line _PROTEIN_ . in this mutant the loss of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ leads to an elevated level of _PROTEIN_ a closely related protein that is under negative control by _PROTEIN_ due to relief of repression by _PROTEIN_ citation . furthermore the _PROTEIN_ mutant develops more leaves than plants until it starts to flower citation . if _PROTEIN_ can compensate for the lack of endogenous _PROTEIN_ in this mutant _PROTEIN_ protein should return to wt levels . in independent plants that showed a strong _METHOD_ the intact fusion protein as well as a small amount of degraded protein were detected with an antibody . whereas we can not rule out that a small amount of free is also present in planta most of it presumably is generated during protein extraction . the lack of endogenous _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ background was confirmed using an antibody specific for _PROTEIN_ . probing the blot with an antibody specific for _PROTEIN_ revealed that the strong upregulation of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant was reduced by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . furthermore whereas the _PROTEIN_ mutant flowers with leaves under conditions compared to wt plants that flower with leaves the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants flower with leaves . thus _PROTEIN_ can compensate for endogenous _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . we conclude that as a tag does not negatively influence the in vivo function of _PROTEIN_ and the fusion protein will reliably report subcellular localization and transport of _PROTEIN_ . next we investigated the switching behavior of in vivo . when the _METHOD_ was switched off in a small region of interest within the _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ plants for seconds with a power of _METHOD_ was lost inside the entire _LOCATION_ . we attribute this to diffusion of the protein inside the _LOCATION_ because in root cells fixed with paraformaldehyde the same treatment resulted in a bleached spot of a size similar to that observed for immobilized in mowiol . the _PROTEIN_ fusion protein localizes to both the cytoplasm and the _LOCATION_ . to visualize the _LOCATION_ import we performed _METHOD_ recovery after selective photoswitching experiments in transgenic arabidopsis plants . the confocal _METHOD_ microscope used operates with avalanche photodiodes instead of photomultiplier tubes commonly used . the enhanced sensitivity enables us to reduce the of during imaging by using a laser power of less than . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ inside the _LOCATION_ of a root cell was switched off by irradiating a spot of in diameter at nm for seconds . at that point in time _METHOD_ was lost in the entire _LOCATION_ due to diffusion inside the _LOCATION_ . _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ recovered within min . a typical recovery curve is shown in figure . saturation of the relative _METHOD_ intensity was reached at of the initial _METHOD_ intensity in the _LOCATION_ . this would point to a fraction of the protein being immobile . however the initial _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ is stronger than the initial _METHOD_ in the cytoplasm . therefore we consider it is more likely that a limited pool of _METHOD_ proteins in the cytoplasm precludes full recovery in the _LOCATION_ citation . in _PROTEIN_ when we normalized the _METHOD_ intensities in the _LOCATION_ to the initial _METHOD_ in the cytoplasm in control experiments the recovery reached indicating that there is only a small immobile protein fraction . full recovery is also masked by unwanted photoswitching as corroborated by control experiments with only . upon _METHOD_ recovery after selective photoswitching on _LOCATION_ of plants _PROTEIN_ lacking an nls levels of the _METHOD_ are reached much faster but at a strongly reduced level . this suggests that by itself enters the _LOCATION_ by diffusion but does not accumulate there . after reaching maximal recovery the curve shows a gradual linear drop of _METHOD_ . we attribute this to unintended photoswitching to the during image acquisition . for _PROTEIN_ this effect presumably is partially compensated through continued import . nevertheless the effect has to be considered to adequately describe _METHOD_ recovery curves measured in the _LOCATION_ . taken together these data indicate that in contrast to alone the _PROTEIN_ fusion protein reaches the _LOCATION_ by transport . this is congruent with our previous finding that _PROTEIN_ interacts with the _LOCATION_ import receptor _PROTEIN_ . furthermore when added to permeabilized hela cells _PROTEIN_ does not enter the _LOCATION_ in the absence of transportin citation . although the _PROTEIN_ protein is below the limit of the npc _LOCATION_ import obviously does not rely solely on diffusion . passive diffusion through the npc presumably occurs at a reasonable speed only for small proteins and does not allow the protein to accumulate against a concentration gradient citation . moreover transport allows for an additional possibility to regulate trafficking . _PROTEIN_ influences the circadian oscillation of its own transcript by binding to its causing a shift to an alternative splice form with a premature termination codon that is rapidly degraded via decay citation . this impact on selection obviously is a _LOCATION_ event . therefore we wanted to determine whether the _LOCATION_ uptake of _PROTEIN_ correlates with daytime . to simultaneously monitor _METHOD_ recovery after selective photoswitching at different times of the day plants were grown in an antiparallel day/night regime . for _METHOD_ recovery after selective photoswitching curves recorded around the time of the circadian maximum of the _PROTEIN_ oscillation the mean was seconds . around the time of the circadian minimum at was seconds . for alone the _METHOD_ recovery after selective photoswitching curves were nearly identical at the two . thus our data imply that the _LOCATION_ import of _PROTEIN_ appears to be slower around the circadian minimum . presently the molecular basis for this behavior is not known . one may speculate that the higher import rate at the time of maximal _PROTEIN_ mrna concentration may relate to an accordingly higher translation rate . also newly synthesized protein may bear modifications that impact import rates . whether the slightly different import rates impact _PROTEIN_ function e.g . the regulation of other oscillating downstream target transcripts citation remains to be determined . in mammals the protein hnrnp i that shuttles between the cytoplasm and the _LOCATION_ contributes to oscillations of the mrna encoding the circadian clock protein . hnrnp i causes degradation of the mrna through interaction with its utr citation . at times of the day when accumulation of hnrnp i in the _LOCATION_ is highest transcript oscillations are in the declining phase suggesting a contribution of hnrnp i trafficking in shaping the oscillations . to further explore our findings the import kinetics could be compared to those of other plant proteins and the measurements have to be extended to a full circadian cycle . we are working toward a microscope system allowing continuous monitoring over such a long time span without damage to the plant . furthermore the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in mutants with a defective circadian clock will be revealing . recombinant _PROTEIN_ is imported into the _LOCATION_ of cells citation and transgenic arabidopsis plants . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ is also exported from the _LOCATION_ to the cytoplasm photoswitching to the was performed . on immobilized in mowiol the minimal region that can be selectively switched off had a diameter of . using the same experimental design we switched off a region of recombinant embedded in mowiol by exposure to nm with an excitation power of and an exposure time of _METHOD_ . the minimal region that can be selectively switched back to the was determined to have a diameter of . this assures that during photoactivation experiments only fusion proteins inside the _LOCATION_ are photoswitched . using these laser settings the _METHOD_ in the entire cell was switched off . subsequently a small population of the _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was photoactivated inside the _LOCATION_ . the _METHOD_ loss in the _LOCATION_ and the concomitant accumulation of the _METHOD_ signal in the cytoplasm indicate that _PROTEIN_ is exported from the _LOCATION_ . differential subcellular localization is widespread for mammalian hnrnp proteins . while essentially _LOCATION_ at steady state several hnrnp proteins continuously shuttle between the _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm . hnrnp is particularly well studied and shuttles through the action of its domain citation . in plants bidirectional movement between the _LOCATION_ and the cytoplasm has been described for serine/arginine _PROTEIN_ proteins an important class of splicing regulators with _METHOD_ and domains rich in arg and ser . using _METHOD_ loss in photobleaching of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under the camv promoter nucleocytoplasmic shuttling was shown in transient _PROTEIN_ citation . _PROTEIN_ is the first protein in plants shown to undergo bidirectional trafficking between the _LOCATION_ and the cytoplasm . _PROTEIN_ does not harbor a classical _LOCATION_ export sequence that mediates export by _PROTEIN_ and thus the components mediating _PROTEIN_ export are not known citation . in mammals the domain is thought to mediate both import and export and in _PROTEIN_ mutagenesis failed to separate import and export activity citation . whether the domain mediates protein export from the _LOCATION_ in plants is presently unknown . the synthetic can be stably _PROTEIN_ at high levels in transgenic plants . it retains the photoswitching properties of the original dronpa molecule from pectiniidaecitation . thus allows combining _METHOD_ recovery after selective photoswitching and photoactivation experiments in the same cell . by repeating frap experiments in the same cell statistically significant data can be obtained on the level of a single cell . this is particularly important in plants because young meristematic cells with higher metabolic activity are located close to older differentiated cells . the synthetic is also better _PROTEIN_ to the codon usage of mammals than the original dronpa sequence cloned from the coral pectiniidae and indeed _PROTEIN_ was obtained in hela and _PROTEIN_ cells . therefore the synthetic variant can be used advantageously for various applications . the sensitive confocal _METHOD_ microscope we set up to monitor intracellular protein dynamics allowed the use of a low laser intensity and thus reduced of during imaging . _METHOD_ recovery after selective photoswitching measurements revealed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ from the native promoter undergoes transport into the _LOCATION_ . using photoactivation we showed that _PROTEIN_ is also exported from the _LOCATION_ into the cytoplasm . thus _PROTEIN_ is the first protein in plants shown to undergo bidirectional nucleocytoplasmic trafficking . our data suggest that this transport is faster at when the transcript levels are at their daily maximum than at when the transcript levels are at their daily minimum . whether this impacts _PROTEIN_ function e.g . the regulation of other oscillating downstream target transcripts citation citation is subject of further investigations .
