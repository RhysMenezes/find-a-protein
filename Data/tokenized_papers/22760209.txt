triacylglycerol levels and oil bodies persist in sucrose rescued arabidopsis seedlings disrupted in seed oil catabolism . this study set out to establish if tag levels persist as a metabolically inert pool when downstream catabolism is disrupted or if other _METHOD_ such as fatty acid recycling into tag are operating . we show that tag composition changes significantly in suc rescued seedlings compared with that found in dry seeds with and accumulating . however fa is not efficiently recycled back into tag in young seedlings instead partitioning into the _LOCATION_ lipid fraction and diacylglycerol . in the lipolysis mutant sugar the oxidation double mutant _PROTEIN_ levels of tag actually increased in seedlings growing on suc . we performed a transcriptomic study and identified up regulation of an acyltransferase gene _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with homology to a peanut _LOCATION_ acyltransferase . the acyl coenzyme a substrate for this acyltransferase accumulates in mutants that are blocked in oil breakdown postlipolysis . transient _PROTEIN_ in nicotiana benthamiana confirmed involvement in tag synthesis and specificity toward and fas . double mutant analysis with the peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ binding cassette transporter mutant peroxisomal abc indicated involvement of _PROTEIN_ in the partitioning of into tag in mutant seedlings growing on suc . fusion of the _PROTEIN_ protein with green _METHOD_ protein confirmed localization to the _LOCATION_ of n. benthamiana . this work has demonstrated active recycling of and fas into tag when seed oil breakdown is blocked in a process involving a soluble _LOCATION_ acyltransferase .
total tag content in suc rescued mutants disrupted in tag breakdown _PROTEIN_ fa transport across the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and the core reactions of oxidation _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ are shown in figure . while tag was almost completely catabolized in columbia seedlings _PROTEIN_ on suc at d after imbibition the total tag content in dai suc rescued mutant seedlings showed smaller changes compared with dry seed and in some cases increases . these results are consistent with published data on total fa composition and eicosenoic acid levels and confirm these mutants are severely impaired in their ability to catabolize seed storage tag . the increased tag levels in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ dai seedlings suggest de novo tag synthesis is occurring in these mutant seedlings . the slight _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ dai seedlings compared with ds is consistent with this mutant not being completely blocked in fa breakdown as previously reported based on eicosenoic acid levels . compositional analysis of individual tag species confirmed that for col all of the identified tags _PROTEIN_ to near undetectable levels in dai suc rescued seedlings compared with ds in marked contrast to the oil breakdown mutants . in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ suc rescued dai seedlings the levels of most of the tag species including those containing actually increased . in _PROTEIN_ suc rescued dai seedlings the majority of tag species were at similar levels compared with the corresponding ds and in _METHOD_ tag species content was slightly lower than in ds . interestingly in _PROTEIN_ suc rescued dai seedlings we observed an increase in tag species containing and to a lesser extent . these results indicate that blocking different steps in tag catabolism affects not only tag content in dai seedlings but also tag composition . in germinating seedlings the fas released from oil bodies are activated to acyl coas before they are catabolized by peroxisomal fa oxidation . to investigate how the acyl coa pool size and composition changes in concert with the apparent _PROTEIN_ in tag breakdown observed in the mutants we analyzed the acyl coa content in seedlings . in _PROTEIN_ the total acyl coa content in dai seedlings was similar to col . in contrast we observed that in _PROTEIN_ and all oxidation mutants there was an accumulation of acyl coas in dai seedlings compared with col . furthermore the acyl coa profile showed a relative enrichment in long chain acyl coas especially coa in _PROTEIN_ and oxidation mutants . these results confirm that _PROTEIN_ is impaired in lipolysis as has been reported by citation while in _PROTEIN_ and the oxidation mutants lipolysis is not impaired and fas are activated to acyl coas but further catabolism is compromised . in the case of _PROTEIN_ the data suggests efficient incorporation of de novo or recycled and fa/acyl coas into tag but poor utilization of accumulated acyl coa . the observation that impairing the peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ binding cassette transporter function affects tag and acyl coa pool content and composition suggests that other lipid pools may also be affected . to investigate this we analyzed dag and _PROTEIN_ lipid composition in col and _PROTEIN_ ds and dai seedlings . the only difference we observed in ds was a slightly higher dag content in _PROTEIN_ relative to col . however in dai seedlings there was a general increase in microsomal lipids and a _PROTEIN_ in galactolipids in _PROTEIN_ compared with col . the lipid fa composition in _PROTEIN_ dai seedlings showed an increase in content in dag phosphatidic acid phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine compared with col while there were no significant differences in and content between _PROTEIN_ and col in any of the _PROTEIN_ lipids analyzed . values are means sd of measurements from five separate batches of seedlings . asterisk indicates significantly different from col by _PROTEIN_ test . nd not detected . in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ has been described as the _PROTEIN_ enzyme responsible for tag synthesis and accumulation during seed development and is specifically found in tag . however our results imply that in _PROTEIN_ germinating seeds where fa are released from tag and activated to acyl coa but not catabolized via oxidation coa is transferred to microsomal lipids while coa and coa are preferentially incorporated into tag . this finding suggests that an alternative pathway that prefers and over for tag synthesis is operating during _PROTEIN_ seedling establishment . to further investigate the putative alternative pathway for tag synthesis during _PROTEIN_ seedling establishment we performed a transcriptomic study of col and _PROTEIN_ germinating seeds at h after imbibition and dai seedlings using the affymetrix _PROTEIN_ microarray . table ii shows the _PROTEIN_ levels of genes identified to be involved in lipid synthesis and catabolism . only three genes show a greater than fold change in _PROTEIN_ compared with col _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . of these the _PROTEIN_ gene is potentially interesting since it shows greater homology to a peanut cdgat than to _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . quantitative real time pcr analysis showed that while _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ levels in _PROTEIN_ were similar to col during seed germination and seedling establishment _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ hai seeds was fold more abundant than in col . these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ could have a role in an alternative pathway for tag synthesis during _PROTEIN_ seedling establishment . analysis of publicly available affymetrix data revealed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ throughout seed development and seedling establishment in col . although _PROTEIN_ showed the highest _PROTEIN_ levels in developing seeds during the period of maximum tag accumulation _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels were higher than _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ during seed germination and the latter stages of seedling establishment . therefore it is possible that in _PROTEIN_ the block in the import of fa into the _LOCATION_ leads to an increase of acyl coa substrate for the putative _PROTEIN_ and the incorporation of acyl coa into tag with a preference for and over . we used the genevestigator development tool to compare the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in affymetrix datasets in the public domain . we found that _PROTEIN_ shows strong _PROTEIN_ across development stages that is consistently higher than the other three genes apart from the senescence stage where _PROTEIN_ is more strongly _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis genome initiative . to test whether the putative _PROTEIN_ gene encodes for a _LOCATION_ dgat we performed agrobacterium mediated transient _PROTEIN_ in nicotiana benthamiana leaves using _PROTEIN_ as a positive control . five days after agrobacterium infiltration leaves were sampled and tags isolated and analyzed directly from fresh frozen tissue . the results showed a significant increase in tag content in n. benthamiana leaves _PROTEIN_ either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ genes compared with leaves from the empty vector negative control . these results support our homology based assumption that the _PROTEIN_ gene encodes a dgat enzyme although its overall activity appears lower than _PROTEIN_ . trilinolenin stood out in this analysis as the only tag accumulating to higher levels in _PROTEIN_ than _PROTEIN_ . indeed tag composition analysis revealed an enrichment of tags containing for _PROTEIN_ compared with _PROTEIN_ with the latter appearing to preferentially incorporate fa other than into tag . we obtained from the nottingham arabidopsis stock centre an arabidopsis gabi kat insertion line that carries a t dna at the position of the _PROTEIN_ open reading frame . homozygous plants were obtained by self pollination and confirmed by pcr . no obvious morphological or developmental differences compared with col were observed under standard growth room conditions . quantification of tag dag and galactolipids in ds and dai suc grown seedlings of this mutant which we now refer to as _PROTEIN_ showed no differences compared with col . however compared with _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ double mutant did show a significant _PROTEIN_ in the amount of fa derived from tags in dai suc grown seedlings providing further evidence that _PROTEIN_ contributes to recycling into tag . to compare the localization of _PROTEIN_ with that of _PROTEIN_ which is known to be localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ the genes were cloned and fused at their c termini with _METHOD_ . the fused genes were transiently _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana leaves which were analyzed for _METHOD_ patterns using confocal microscopy . as shown in figure the transiently _PROTEIN_ gene products presented a different pattern . while leaves _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ displayed strong _METHOD_ that localized to a reticular network characteristic of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ the more diffuse _METHOD_ pattern observed for the transiently _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ can be taken as evidence that this enzyme is _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ . there is precedence for this _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ versus _LOCATION_ labeling pattern in n. benthamiana leaves . these results indicate that there is a _LOCATION_ route for tag synthesis where the _PROTEIN_ encoded by _GENE_ preferentially incorporates and to a lesser extent into tag .
