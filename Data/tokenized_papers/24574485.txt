rna directed dna methylation is essential for de novo dna methylation in higher plants and recent reports established novel elements of this silencing pathway in the model organism arabidopsis thaliana . involved in de _PROTEIN_ dna methylation _PROTEIN_ and the closely related _PROTEIN_ of dna methylation _PROTEIN_ are members of a plant specific family of dsrna binding proteins characterized by conserved xh/xs domains and implicated in the regulation of rddm at chromatin targets . genetic analyses have suggested redundant as well as non overlapping activities for different members of the gene family . however detailed insights into the function of xh/xs domain proteins are still elusive . by the generation and analysis of higher order mutant combinations affected in _PROTEIN_ and further members of the gene family we have provided additional evidence for their redundant activity . distinct roles for members of the xh/xs domain gene family were indicated by differences in their _PROTEIN_ and subcellular localization . _METHOD_ protein tagged _PROTEIN_ genes were _PROTEIN_ either in _LOCATION_ or in the cytoplasm suggestive of activities of xh/xs domain proteins in association with chromatin as well as outside the _LOCATION_ compartment . in addition we observed altered location of a functional _PROTEIN_ venus reporter from the _LOCATION_ into the cytoplasm under conditions when availability of further _PROTEIN_ proteins was limited . this is suggestive of a mechanism by which redistribution of xh/xs domain proteins could compensate for the loss of closely related proteins .
for analysis of xh/xs domain proteins we first obtained potential loss of function mutants for all nine predicted members of the family characterized by an xh and a closely related xs domain . we adopted the nomenclature introduced recently and characterized t dna insertion mutants in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and identified a potentially leaky t dna insertion line for _PROTEIN_ with an insertion in the untranslated region . moreover we obtained insertion mutants for all three additional loci predicted to encode proteins with an xh and an xs domain but to lack a zf xs domain . phylogenetic analyses performed with the entire predicted coding region of these loci highlighted an overall similarity to xh/xs domain genes . we therefore termed these loci _PROTEIN_ . rt pcr analysis of the insertion lines demonstrated defects in _PROTEIN_ of full length mrnas for all lines except for for which no transcript could be detected under our experimental conditions . with respect to _PROTEIN_ we found defects in _PROTEIN_ of its untranslated region . nevertheless earlier analysis of this _PROTEIN_ allele suggested that it has retained some of its functionality taken together analysis of t dna insertion lines suggested identification of loss of function mutants for the xh/xs domain loci although we can not rule out the possibility that the _PROTEIN_ and alleles do not represent null alleles but still exhibit some remaining activity . analysis of _PROTEIN_ mutant lines revealed defects in rddm that appeared weaker than those of mutants deficient in additional characterized components of the rddm pathway . this led to suggestions of partially redundant activities among xh/xs domain proteins corroborated further by analysis of fdm mutant combinations . however recent reports indicated only limited functional redundancy within the gene family substantiated by the finding that _PROTEIN_ and at least two of its paralogues form complexes in which they could exhibit discernible functions in the control of rddm . having identified potential loss of function lines for the arabidopsis xh/xs domain proteins we determined their roles in dna methylation at selected rddm loci . moreover we obtained mutant combinations which culminated in the generation of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ hextuple and the triple mutant . loss of function mutants affected in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ loci have been described to impact on dna methylation of rddm targets and we therefore tested some of these loci . when probing methylation of the rrna gene by using restriction digests performed with hpaii and with haeiii a difference to that of the wild type was apparent in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ dna indicative of weakly reduced chg and cg methylation and a reduction in chh methylation in the hextuple mutant . single mutants as well as the triple mutant combination exhibited no strong differences to wild type dna in comparison . a similar observation was made when analysing the locus in haeiii cut dna samples with a reduction in dna methylation in the chh context apparent specifically for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ dna whereas less pronounced or no differences were observed for the other mutant lines under our experimental conditions . to further test the effects of xh/xs domain proteins on methylation in the cg and chg context we analysed hpaii and _METHOD_ cut genomic dna that was probed for _PROTEIN_ isr . this suggested reduced symmetric dna methylation most apparent in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ hextuple mutant . in contrast we did not observe clear differences when analysing rddm loci in idr single and triple mutant lines indicating that these loci are not essential for dna methylation of analysed targets . analysis of dna methylation and gene silencing in _PROTEIN_ mutants . southern blot

also analysed _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gus reporter line containing a transcriptionally silenced gus transgene that exhibits reactivation in a range of arabidopsis gene silencing mutants . within this context limited _PROTEIN_ gus reactivation has been described for arabidopsis mutants affected in loci functionally connected to rddm and we asked whether or not xh/xs domain proteins could be involved in the control of _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ as well . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gus exhibited a reproducible statistically significant increase in _PROTEIN_ gus activity when compared with _PROTEIN_ gus controls . however no prominent alterations in gus activity were observed in any of the single mutants or in . this indicated combinatorial activities of a subset of xh/xs domain proteins in the regulation of _PROTEIN_ gus . taken together analysis of single mutant lines suggested only a limited impact on dna methylation at endogenous rddm target sites and activation of _PROTEIN_ gus . in the case of _PROTEIN_ this might be a consequence of using a leaky allele which would explain discrepancies between our results and findings made with potentially more severe _PROTEIN_ alleles . nevertheless the more pronounced alterations in dna methylation that were observed in the _PROTEIN_ hextuple mutant indicated that these loci exhibit overlapping redundant activities in the control of dna methylation . this corroborates findings by et al . who described additive effects on dna methylation in fdm mutant combinations . to determine _PROTEIN_ of xh/xs domain genes we generated cdnas from different plant tissues and analysed transcript levels by rt pcr after normalization to _PROTEIN_ . these experiments revealed _PROTEIN_ of all loci except for transcripts of which were not detectable under our conditions . no prominent differences in tissue specificity in gene _PROTEIN_ were observed when analysing _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcript levels in mrna extracted from seedlings roots leaves or flowers whereas _PROTEIN_ of and appeared most pronounced in floral organs . _PROTEIN_ analysis of xh/xs domain genes in arabidopsis

. gus staining of _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ gus and _PROTEIN_ gus at dag . gus stained flowers of _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ gus and _PROTEIN_ gus from d old plants . bars . to address gene _PROTEIN_ in planta we generated promoter gus reporter constructs of selected _PROTEIN_ genes . specifically we analysed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which represent a distinct subclade in the phylogenetic tree of the protein family in order to determine overlaps and differences in gene _PROTEIN_ of these closely related loci . in seedlings _PROTEIN_ gus staining was detectable in distal portions of cotyledons and weaker _PROTEIN_ was observed in root tips a pattern that remained essentially unaltered throughout vegetative development . additional _PROTEIN_ gus activity was observed in flowers where it appeared to be restricted to the male gametophyte . only weak _PROTEIN_ gus activity was observed in root _METHOD_ which differed from rt pcr analyses and root _PROTEIN_ of a venus tagged _PROTEIN_ translational reporter line suggesting that cis acting elements required for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in root tissue are not fully active in _PROTEIN_ gus . _PROTEIN_ gus and _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ was stronger in comparison exhibiting signals in roots hypocotyls and cotyledons of seedlings whereas true leaves showed strong _PROTEIN_ only of _PROTEIN_ gus . in flowers _PROTEIN_ gus staining produced signals in the vasculature of sepals and _PROTEIN_ as well as in anther filaments and parts of the style whereas _PROTEIN_ gus staining was visible in the anthers including pollen as well as in the stigma . in addition _PROTEIN_ gus showed activity in the entire root both at the seedling stage and in older plants whereas _PROTEIN_ gus staining was essentially restricted to the root vasculature and emerging _PROTEIN_ roots . subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ venus reporters in live col root _METHOD_ and in root meristem epidermis cells at higher magnification . _PROTEIN_

iodide to visualize cell boundaries . bars . taken together the results obtained from gene _PROTEIN_ and reporter analysis indicated distinct gene _PROTEIN_ patterns reflecting tissue specificity in activity of these closely related arabidopsis xh/xs domain genes . to determine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ proteins we generated _PROTEIN_ venus and _PROTEIN_ venus _PROTEIN_ cassettes in which the entire _PROTEIN_ coding regions were fused to the venus _METHOD_ protein and _PROTEIN_ under control of their endogenous promoters . confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis revealed that both _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ venus and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ venus _PROTEIN_ could be observed in root _METHOD_ but the signals differed in their subcellular localization . when _PROTEIN_ in col _PROTEIN_ venus lines accumulated signals in the _LOCATION_ whereas _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ venus exhibited signals predominantly in the cytoplasm . we then asked whether or not differences in _PROTEIN_ reporter localization could result from differences in _PROTEIN_ levels and fused both _PROTEIN_ venus _PROTEIN_ cassettes to the strong ribosomal protein _PROTEIN_ promoter and analysed _PROTEIN_ of the resultant reporter constructs in wild type col . ectopic overexpression of both transgenes confirmed the results obtained with endogenous reporters with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ venus root _METHOD_ exhibiting signals in _LOCATION_ whereas _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ venus signals were most pronounced in the cytoplasm . in additional experiments we performed promoter swaps and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ venus under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter and vice versa _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ venus by the _PROTEIN_ promoter . these experiments demonstrated _LOCATION_ signals in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ venus lines and cytoplasmic signals in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ venus lines . collectively our analyses indicated that neither variations in _PROTEIN_ domains nor _PROTEIN_ levels significantly affected the distinct subcellular distribution of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ reporter proteins . this is in agreement with roles for _PROTEIN_ proteins in both the _LOCATION_ and the cytoplasm . differences in the subcellular distribution of closely related _PROTEIN_ proteins are suggestive of differing functions . we further addressed this issue and first determined _PROTEIN_ reporter protein functionality in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background . to this end we introduced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ venus and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ venus into _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ gus transgene . _PROTEIN_ gus activity was increased in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ reflecting defects in controlling the silenced state of the transgene . this was different in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ venus and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ venus which both exhibited reduced _PROTEIN_ gus activity a response that appeared more pronounced upon _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ venus reporter construct . these findings suggested that both _PROTEIN_ venus reporter proteins are capable of rescuing defects in _PROTEIN_ gus silencing . functional analysis of _PROTEIN_ venus reporter proteins . _PROTEIN_ gus

plotted as fold induction of activity found in the _PROTEIN_ gus controls . two independent experiments are shown and standard deviation is indicated . asterisks and brackets highlight significant differences in _PROTEIN_ gus activity between samples . analysis of _PROTEIN_ venus reporters in col revealed distinct _PROTEIN_ venus and _PROTEIN_ venus signals in root meristem cells . on the other hand both reporters rescued defects in _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ control in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ at least to some extent raising questions about the _METHOD_ involved . to address this issue we assayed the _PROTEIN_ venus reporter localization in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background . we first analysed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ venus and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ venus _PROTEIN_ in the corresponding _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutants . similar to col we found _PROTEIN_ venus signals in the _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ root meristem cells whereas _PROTEIN_ venus was visible in the cytoplasm of _PROTEIN_ root meristem cells . identical results were obtained when analysing _PROTEIN_ venus distribution in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ venus distribution in _PROTEIN_ suggesting that defects in endogenous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ do not influence _PROTEIN_ venus reporter distribution . subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ venus reporter proteins in fixed root meristem cells of _PROTEIN_ mutants . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ venus and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ venus in _PROTEIN_ . note the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ venus reporter signals in the nucleolar cavity whilst

and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ venus in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ hextuple mutant and determined reporter localization in root meristem cells . subcellular distribution of _PROTEIN_ venus remained detectable predominantly in the cytoplasm but alterations were observed for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ venus . this reporter line exhibited signals in the _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm when _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . thus unlike in col _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ in which _PROTEIN_ venus signals are restricted to the _LOCATION_ a combinatorial loss of xh/xs domain proteins coincided with a visibly altered subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ no longer confined to the _LOCATION_ compartment . when taken together analysis of _PROTEIN_ reporter lines indicated localization in the _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm and highlighted flexible subcellular _PROTEIN_ protein distribution under conditions when cytoplasmic _PROTEIN_ protein abundance appeared restricted .
