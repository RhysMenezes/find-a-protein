the ultimate goal of proteomic analysis of a cell compartment should be the exhaustive identification of resident proteins excluding proteins from other cell compartments . reaching such a goal closely depends on the reliability of the isolation procedure for the cell compartment of interest . plant cell walls possess specific difficulties the lack of a surrounding _LOCATION_ may result in the loss of cell wall proteins during the isolation procedure polysaccharide networks of cellulose hemicelluloses and pectins form potential traps for contaminants such as intracellular proteins . several reported procedures to isolate cell walls for proteomic analyses led to the isolation of a high proportion of predicted intracellular proteins . since isolated cell walls should hold secreted proteins one can imagine alternative procedures to prepare cell walls containing a lower proportion of contaminant proteins . the rationales of several published procedures to isolate cell walls for proteomics were analyzed with _PROTEIN_ to the bioinformatic predicted subcellular localization of the identified proteins . critical steps were revealed homogenization in low ionic strength acid buffer to retain cwp purification through increasing density cushions extensive washes with a low ionic strength acid buffer to retain cwp while removing as many _LOCATION_ proteins as possible and absence of detergents . a new procedure was developed to prepare cell walls from etiolated hypocotyls of arabidopsis thaliana . after salt extraction a high proportion of proteins predicted to be secreted was released belonging to the same functional classes as proteins identified using previously described protocols . finally removal of intracellular proteins was obtained using detergents but their amount represented less than in _METHOD_ of the total protein extract based on protein quantification . the new cell wall preparation described in this paper gives the lowest proportion of proteins predicted to be intracellular when compared to available protocols . the application of its principles should lead to a more realistic view of the cell wall proteome at least for the weakly bound cwp extractable by salts . in addition it offers a clean cell wall preparation for subsequent extraction of strongly bound cwp .
several strategies have been designed to gain access to cwp . the most labile cwp i.e . those having little or no interactions with cell wall components can be recovered in culture media of cell suspension cultures _PROTEIN_ or liquid cultured seedlings _PROTEIN_ . _LOCATION_ fluids can be harvested from cell suspension cultures _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or intact organs such as leaves _PROTEIN_ . however such analysis can not be done in all cases . it is then necessary to isolate cell walls starting with a drastic mechanical disruption of the material of interest . consequently labile cwp may be lost and intracellular proteins or organelle fragments may contaminate cell wall preparations . to design a procedure for cell wall isolation and subsequent protein extraction several general features should be kept in _PROTEIN_ . plant and fungal cell walls are _PROTEIN_ built up with highly dense polysaccharides . this property can be used to purify them through density gradients by centrifugation . the biochemical structure of walls is complex and cwp can be bound to the _PROTEIN_ by van der waals forces hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic or ionic attractions . such interactions can also be modulated by the composition of the isolation medium . commonly a low ionic strength is preferred to preserve ionic bonds but also to dilute the ionic strength of the cell wall itself . an acidic ph is chosen to _PROTEIN_ the interactions between proteins and polysaccharides as in planta . once isolated cell walls are classically treated by buffers to release proteins and by licl buffers for extraction of glycoprotein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the use of detergents has also been reported to extract proteins strongly embedded in the polysaccharide _PROTEIN_ like wall associated kinases _PROTEIN_ . finally cwp can be covalently bound to cell wall components so that they are resistant to salt extraction . at present there is no satisfactory procedure to isolate them . we analyze recent publications using different methods to isolate cell walls from plants or yeast prior to proteomic analysis _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ et al . used a. thaliana cell cultures to purify cell walls . the procedure is schematically represented in figure . the first step consisted in cell grinding in water . the homogenate was layered onto glycerol and let to sediment for several hours . the cell wall pellet was resuspended in water and washed times by repeated centrifugations . the proteins were sequentially extracted with m and urea buffer . the extracted proteins were separated by ge and identified by maldi tof _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the identified proteins were analyzed with several bioinformatic _METHOD_ and classified as outside having trans _LOCATION_ domain or intracellular . figure represents the results of both extractions . it appears that the extract contains the highest proportion of proteins predicted to be secreted and that the use of detergents and chaotropic agents brings out mostly intracellular proteins even if of this fraction corresponds to predicted secreted proteins . twenty four different proteins predicted to be secreted were identified with this method . cell wall preparation from a. thaliana cell cultures . a schematic representation of the purification of cell walls from a. thaliana cell suspension cultures and of the different extracts obtained . b number of proteins identified in each extract after separation by ge and maldi tof _METHOD_ analysis . after bioinformatic analysis proteins were classified as outside having at least one trans _LOCATION_ domain and intracellular . proteins for which predictions by different bioinformatic _METHOD_ are in conflict are classified as `` not clear '' . twenty four different proteins predicted to be secreted were identified in this study . _METHOD_ of medicago sativa were used for cell wall protein profiling . in this case a different procedure was used to isolate cell walls . tissues were frozen and ground in cold grinding buffer with pvpp . cell walls were isolated by filtering through a mesh nylon _LOCATION_ and washed sequentially with grinding buffer m nacl acetone and mm na acetate ph . the proteins were sequentially extracted with m and m licl buffers . the data obtained in this publication was analyzed as mentioned above and the results are presented in figure . the proportion of intracellular proteins in the extract is quite high . it _METHOD_ that the first washes do not eliminate such proteins . it is also possible that the wash performed with m nacl eliminates part of the secreted proteins . twenty five different proteins predicted to be secreted were identified in this study . cell wall preparation from m. sativa _METHOD_ . a schematic representation of the purification procedure of cell walls from m. sativa _METHOD_ and of the different extracts obtained . b number of proteins identified in each extract after ge separation and lc _METHOD_ analysis . proteins were classified as indicated in legend to figure . since the m. sativa genome is not fully sequenced the sequence of the n terminus of some proteins is not known . they were classified as `` not predictable '' . twenty five different proteins predicted to be secreted were identified in this study . the procedure for isolation of cell walls from the dimorphic fungus candida albicans used by pitarch et al _PROTEIN_ was based on previous methods designed to isolate proteins covalently linked to the polysaccharide _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . yeast and hyphae were collected by centrifugation and filtration washed several times with lysis buffer _METHOD_ and mechanically disrupted in lysis buffer . after centrifugation the pellet was successively washed with cold water and _PROTEIN_ concentrations of nacl in mm _METHOD_ . proteins were extracted with boiling _PROTEIN_ extraction buffer _PROTEIN_ . the residue was separated in two fractions one was extracted with alkali and the other was submitted to sequential digestions by a _PROTEIN_ followed by an exochitinase to break down the polysaccharide _PROTEIN_ . each of the four samples were separated by ge digested with trypsin and the peptides identified by maldi tof or maldi tof/tof _METHOD_ . the proteins identified in this publication were submitted to bioinformatic analysis and the results are represented in figure . only four proteins predicted to be secreted were identified . all the others are predicted to be intracellular proteins . preparation of cell walls from c. albicans . a schematic representation of the purification procedure of cell walls from the dimorphic fungus c. albicans and of the extracts obtained . b number of proteins identified in each extract after ge and analysis by maldi tof or maldi tof/tof _METHOD_ proteins were classified as indicated in legend to figure . four different proteins predicted to be secreted were identified in this study . altogether this evaluation of three procedures to isolate cell walls from plants or fungi prior to proteomic analyses shows that they all produce a material containing a high proportion of proteins predicted to be intracellular suggesting they are contaminants . even if a careful bioinformatic analysis allows the discrimination between secreted and intracellular proteins the time and effort consumed is not satisfactory . from the analysis of the presented methods and other classical cell wall preparations used for the purification of cell wall enzymes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ several points appear to be essential for the purification of cell walls . first the presence of nacl at early steps of cell wall preparations of m. sativa and c. albicans in grinding or washing buffers might induce a release of cwp even at a low concentration _PROTEIN_ . this might indirectly increase the proportion of intracellular proteins sticking non specifically to cell wall polysaccharides . the use of a low ionic strength buffer for tissue grinding and subsequent washes to purify cell walls appears as an interesting alternative to prevent loss of cwp . second the protocol used for a. thaliana cell suspension cultures is the only one including a purification of cell walls through a dense medium i.e . sedimentation in glycerol . proteins predicted to be secreted represented of the identified proteins . it _METHOD_ that a series of sedimentations/centrifugations in solutions of increasing densities would help in eliminating organelles and other vesicles less dense than cell wall polysaccharides _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . third despite repeated washes the cell wall preparation from a. thaliana cell suspension cultures still contained a high proportion of proteins predicted to be intracellular . a way to eliminate soluble contaminants such as intracellular proteins is to perform extensive washes of cell walls with a low ionic strength buffer _PROTEIN_ . finally the addition of polyvinyl polypyrrolidone to trap plant phenolic compounds _PROTEIN_ as well as anti proteases to limit protein degradation during the manipulations _PROTEIN_ improves the quality of protein identification by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . our procedure was established on the basis of these requirements . eleven day old etiolated hypocotyls were ground in a low ionic strength buffer mm acetate buffer ph in m sucrose . pvpp and anti proteases were added to the homogenate centrifuged and the resulting pellet resuspended in mm acetate buffer ph with increasing concentrations of sucrose and centrifuged . the residue was extensively washed on a nylon _LOCATION_ with large amounts of mm acetate buffer ph . the cell wall fraction was ground in liquid nitrogen in a mortar to reduce the size of the particles which improves the subsequent extraction of proteins . in a typical cell wall preparation from a. thaliana hypocotyls g of fresh material resulted in g of lyophilized powder . cell wall preparation from a. thaliana hypocotyls . schematic representation of the purification procedure of cell walls of a. thaliana etiolated hypocotyls . sixteen g of fresh etiolated hypocotyls were ground . all supernatants were discarded after each centrifugation . the residue was extensively washed on a nylon net with l of mm acetate buffer ph . the pellet was ground in liquid nitrogen in a mortar with a pestle in order to reduce the size of the fragments and lyophilized obtaining g of dry powder . the lyophilized powder was sequentially extracted with salts that can extract proteins ionically bound to the polysaccharide _PROTEIN_ . calcium chloride has been reported as an efficient salt for the extraction of cell wall proteins _PROTEIN_ and was used in this procedure to identify secreted proteins . from g of lyophilized powder of proteins were routinely obtained . licl was known as potent salt to extract hydroxyproline rich glycoproteins from chlamydomonas reinhardii cells and was successfully used on m. sativa cell walls and a. thaliana rosettes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . licl only extracted of proteins were identified as predicted to be secreted but only were specifically extracted by this salt . extraction of proteins from a. thaliana hypocotyls with salts . a half of the lyophilized powder was successively suspended in m mm acetate buffer ph and in m licl mm acetate buffer ph . the extract contained of proteins . the licl extract contained of proteins . b number of proteins identified in each extract after ge separation and analysis by maldi tof _METHOD_ or lc _METHOD_ . proteins were classified as indicated in legend to figure . seventy three different proteins predicted to be secreted were identified in this study . a recent review on cwp identified in proteomic studies by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ concluded that more than of them have a basic pi and around in salt extractable fractions . this is a serious problem for the separation of cwp by the classical ge since it is well known that basic glycoproteins are poorly resolved by this technique . we have then used ge for the separation each band stained with _METHOD_ blue was digested by trypsin and further analyzed by maldi tof _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ . each protein was analyzed using several bioinformatic _METHOD_ as described above . seventy three different proteins predicted to be secreted were identified in this study whereas only proteins predicted to be intracellular and proteins predicted to have trans _LOCATION_ domains were found . the protocol of cwp extraction we used is almost the same as the one employed with m. sativa _METHOD_ . but comparison of figures and shows big differences in the proportion of proteins predicted to be intracellular or having trans _LOCATION_ domains . since the _PROTEIN_ difference between the two protocols is the addition of centrifugations through a dense medium it shows that this step is critical for the purity of cell walls . the proteins predicted to be secreted identified in this study belong to the same functional classes as those described in previous cell wall proteomes established from cell wall preparations _PROTEIN_ . shortly these functional classes comprise proteins acting on polysaccharides _PROTEIN_ proteases proteins with interacting domains oxido reductases proteins involved in signaling processes structural proteins proteins of unknown function and miscellaneous proteins . the new protocol appears to be more efficient since a large proportion of identified proteins are predicted to be targeted to the compartment of interest . since we noticed that the use of detergents described in previous protocols increased the proportion of proteins predicted to be intracellular or having trans _LOCATION_ domains _PROTEIN_ we wanted to test it on our cell wall preparation . the pellet was treated with boiling _PROTEIN_ dtt buffer _PROTEIN_ . less than of proteins were obtained . as for the other fractions the proteins were concentrated separated by ge and the _METHOD_ blue stained bands were analyzed by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . fifty three proteins were identified in this fraction among which were predicted to be secreted were predicted to have trans _LOCATION_ domains and were predicted to originate from intracellular compartments including cytoplasm _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ microbodies and chloroplasts . comparison of these results with those shown in figures and in which detergents such as chaps urea dtt or _PROTEIN_ dtt were also used _METHOD_ that treatment with detergents _PROTEIN_ extract intracellular proteins as well as _LOCATION_ proteins trapped within the polysaccharide _PROTEIN_ respectively and of proteins predicted to be intracellular and of proteins having trans _LOCATION_ domain in the case of a. thaliana cell walls . unless looking for specific proteins only extractible in those conditions this step should be avoided for a large scale cell wall proteomic study . it can rather be a good method to get rid of contaminants and to have a cleaner preparation for subsequent extraction of strongly bound cwp .
one hundred and fifty mg of a. thaliana seeds were sowed per magenta box containing murashige and skoog medium _PROTEIN_ supplemented with w/v sucrose and w/v agar . seedlings were grown at in the dark for days . for one experiment hypocotyls from magenta boxes were collected . one cm long hypocotyls were cut below the cotyledons and above the root washed with distilled water and transferred into ml of mm acetate buffer ph m sucrose and protease inhibitor cocktail ml per g of hypocotyl fresh weight . the mixture was ground in a blender at full speed for min . after adding pvpp the mixture was incubated in cold room for min while stirring . cell walls were separated from soluble cytoplasmic fluid by centrifugation of the homogenate for min at g and . the pellet was further purified by two successive centrifugations in ml of mm acetate buffer ph respectively m and m sucrose . the residue was washed with l of mm acetate buffer ph on a nylon net . the resulting cell wall fraction was ground in liquid nitrogen in a mortar with a pestle prior to lyophilization . starting with g fresh weight of hypocotyls this process resulted in g dry powder . typically g of lyophilized cell walls was used for one experiment . proteins were extracted by successive salt solutions in this order two extractions each time with ml solution followed by two extractions with ml licl solution . cell walls were resuspended by vortexing for min at room temperature and then centrifuged for min at g and . supernatants were desalted using econo dg columns equilibrated with formic acid ammonium salt . the extract were lyophilized and resuspended in sample buffer for separation of proteins by ge as previously described _PROTEIN_ . the next extraction was carried out by _PROTEIN_ and dtt . the cell wall preparation was treated with ml solution containing mm tris _PROTEIN_ mm dtt ph . the mixture was boiled for min and centrifuged for min at g and . the supernatant was dialyzed against l in _LOCATION_ kda mwco bags at room temperature then concentrated by successive centrifugation using the centrifugal filter devices _LOCATION_ at g followed by speed vacuum centrifugation . the protein content of each extract was measured using the bradford method _PROTEIN_ with the _METHOD_ protein assay reagent kit using bovine serum albumin as standard . gels were stained with _METHOD_ brilliant blue based method _PROTEIN_ . colored bands were digested with trypsin and maldi tof _METHOD_ or lc _METHOD_ analyses were performed as previously reported _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the sequences of the identified proteins were subsequently analyzed with several bioinformatic _METHOD_ to predict their sub cellular localization _PROTEIN_ . in some cases predictions were not the same with the three _METHOD_ . results are then indicated as `` not clear '' . data are described in tables . ge one or two dimensional gel electrophoresis cwp cell wall proteins chaps propanesulfonic acid dtt dithiothreitol edta ethylene diamino tetraacetic acid lc _METHOD_ liquid chromatography tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ maldi tof _PROTEIN_ assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride pvpp polyvinyl polypyrrolidone _PROTEIN_ sodium dodecyl sulphate
