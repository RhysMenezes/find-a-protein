_LOCATION_ are dna containing organelles unique to plant cells . in arabidopsis one third of the genes required for embryo development encode _LOCATION_ localized proteins . to help understand the role of _LOCATION_ in embryogenesis and postembryonic development we characterized proteins of the mitochondrial transcription termination _PROTEIN_ family which in animal models comprises dna binding regulators of mitochondrial transcription . of arabidopsis mterf proteins are _LOCATION_ localized . genetic complementation shows that at least one _LOCATION_ mterf belaya smert _PROTEIN_ is required for embryogenesis . the _PROTEIN_ postembryonic phenotypes of genetic mosaics with the bsm mutation are severe abnormalities in leaf development . mutant bsm cells are albino are compromised in growth and suffer defects in global _LOCATION_ gene _PROTEIN_ . the bsm phenotype could be phenocopied by inhibition of _LOCATION_ translation with spectinomycin . _LOCATION_ translation is essential for cell viability in dicotyledonous species such as tobacco but not in monocotyledonous maize . here genetic interactions between _PROTEIN_ and the gene encoding _LOCATION_ homomeric acetyl coa _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ suggest that there is a functional redundancy in malonyl coa biosynthesis that permits bsm cell survival in arabidopsis . overall our results indicate that biosynthesis of malonyl coa and _LOCATION_ derived systemic growth promoting compounds are the processes that link plant development and _LOCATION_ gene _PROTEIN_ .
flowering plants have the highest number of mterf genes among eukaryotes . _METHOD_ fusions of all members of the arabidopsis mterf family showed that mterf proteins were targeted to chloroplasts and were mitochondrial whereas one fusion was distributed equally between the _LOCATION_ and the cytoplasm . six gene fusions showed no _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the detection of conserved protein motifs revealed the presence of two motifs specific for arabidopsis mterf proteins targeted to the mitochondria . integration of genome organization information indicated species specific gene family expansion through tandem duplication both in rice and arabidopsis . in contrast _LOCATION_ targeted mterfs belong to a single subtype probably representing the ancestral family composition . to determine the involvement of _LOCATION_ mterfs in embryo development we surveyed transferred dna insertion mutant alleles . plants with mutations in four genes developed seeds with arrested embryos . the bsm mutant has been first identified and first characterized in detail . in a progeny of _PROTEIN_ plants of the seeds had embryos arrested at the _PROTEIN_ globular stage of development . immature mutant seeds remained white indicating a failure of the endosperm and embryo to differentiate chloroplasts . these developmental defects were complemented by the wt _PROTEIN_ protein as well as by its _METHOD_ and tandem affinity purification tag fusions . dry seeds with arrested embryos were cultured in vitro . although wt seeds germinated within d the first germination events with bsm seeds were only observed after wk and led to poorly growing malformed albino seedlings . therefore to induce cell proliferation and de novo organogenesis these bsm seedlings were transferred to medium supplemented with cytokinin and auxin resulting in stable shoot cultures that _PROTEIN_ a slow growth over several years . dna gel blot hybridization showed that the shoot cultures were homozygous for the mutant bsm allele and contained chloroplast dna . we concluded that phytohormones promote the growth of albino bsm cells . _LOCATION_ possess two types of dna dependent rna polymerases a _LOCATION_ encoded bacteriophage type rna polymerase and a bacterium type multisubunit rna polymerase _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ catalytic core requires products of the _LOCATION_ genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _LOCATION_ encoded class i genes such as _PROTEIN_ are transcribed predominantly by _PROTEIN_ . class ii genes are transcribed by both _PROTEIN_ and nep whereas a few class iii genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are thought to be transcribed exclusively by nep . in arabidopsis rrna genes belong to class ii but _PROTEIN_ is responsible for most transcriptional activity of and genes . mature rrna and rrna were not detectable in bsm cells . the _PROTEIN_ dependent _PROTEIN_ of the protein coding genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was similarly affected whereas clpp transcripts levels increased . a similar response characterized albino tobacco plants mutated in _PROTEIN_ rna polymerase . to understand the changes in clpp transcript size we analyzed its splicing by rt pcr . in arabidopsis the coding region of clpp is disrupted by two introns that belong to group iib and group iia classes . in albino shoots rt pcr showed that the second clpp group iia intron was not spliced . the last gene exon codes for the aa residues that include two residues of a clpp catalytic triad indicating that the mutant polypeptide is catalytically inactive . the _LOCATION_ clppr protease complex is reported to be essential in both tobacco and arabidopsis . protein coding regions of _LOCATION_ genes for the _PROTEIN_ subunit of the _PROTEIN_ synthase and ribosomal proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are interrupted by group iia introns . the production of the _PROTEIN_ orf also requires a transsplicing event of a iib intron . results showed that _PROTEIN_ transsplicing was normal but that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ group iia introns were not spliced in bsm cells . these nonspliced transcripts encode mutant proteins of which _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are most probably nonfunctional . arabidopsis plants with defective _PROTEIN_ splicing are albino . rna editing increases the complexity of the _LOCATION_ transcriptome can influence the protein activity and be affected by pigment deficiency . sequencing of cloned cdna derived pcr fragments suggested that the clpp and _PROTEIN_ transcripts were fully edited in the mutant . plastomes of most flowering plants encode a _PROTEIN_ maturase that is thought to be a transacting splicing _PROTEIN_ for group iia introns . splicing of the clpp second intron is thought to be _PROTEIN_ independent . inhibiting _LOCATION_ translation in wt cells with the antibiotic spectinomycin allowed us to replicate the growth compromised albino phenotype of bsm . spectinomycin abolished splicing of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ group iia introns but not of the clpp second intron . thus processing of the clpp transcript depends on _PROTEIN_ and probably does not require _PROTEIN_ suggesting a more direct role for _PROTEIN_ in clpp second intron splicing . _PROTEIN_ protein sequence was aligned to create a structural model of the _PROTEIN_ protein with i tasser taking advantage of the recently solved crystal structures of human . _PROTEIN_ is slightly larger than and the model suggests that _PROTEIN_ consists of a central core that is structurally homologous to the mammalian mterfs flanked by n and c terminal extensions . the mterf fold _METHOD_ to have evolved to mediate protein _LOCATION_ acid interactions . in this respect the model predicts that _PROTEIN_ should be capable of binding dsdna and suggests a similar mode of interaction to that observed in human . nevertheless conservation of the critical residues that enable the human to bind and recognize dna was not observed in _PROTEIN_ probably reflecting a completely different _LOCATION_ acid binding specificity . moreover the n and c terminal extensions in _PROTEIN_ could conceivably confer additional functionalities to the protein although it is also possible that they simply allow _PROTEIN_ to interact with a dna sequence longer than the bp bound by human . to verify these conclusions bacterially produced _PROTEIN_ was refolded on ni beads and incubated with radioactively labeled double stranded restriction fragments of cloned arabidopsis chloroplast dna . although _PROTEIN_ bound dna no preferential retention of cpdna fragments was observed . next we characterized _PROTEIN_ protein fusions produced in planta . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was targeted to chloroplasts . when purified chloroplasts were treated with protease _PROTEIN_ tap proteolysis was facilitated by nonionic detergents indicating that the protein is localized within _LOCATION_ . mterfs are components of mitochondrial nucleoids in animals . chloroplast nucleoids are known to partition both into triton insoluble g chloroplast preparations and soluble > mda complexes of chloroplasts . in cell extracts prepared with nonionic detergents triton x or nonidet p one half of the _PROTEIN_ tap was retained in a soluble complex that did not enter the blue native polyacrylamide gels at a > mda cutoff . the remainder of the _PROTEIN_ tap partitioned into triton insoluble g chloroplast preparations . this partitioning was disrupted by digitonin and on bn gels digitonin extracted kda _PROTEIN_ tap comigrated with a discrete band of kda representing either a heteromeric complex or a homomeric trimer . digitonin sensitivity indicates that _PROTEIN_ could be a component of a peripheral _LOCATION_ complex . notably chloroplast nucleoids are thought to be anchored to the _LOCATION_ . previous studies have shown that mterf _PROTEIN_ copurifies with transcriptionally active _LOCATION_ chromosomes . _PROTEIN_ was identified as a component of the soluble nucleoid fraction . plants with a mutation in mterf _GENE_ have reduced rrna levels and protein synthesis rates in _LOCATION_ . taken together these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ is likely to be implicated in organellar gene _PROTEIN_ possibly in a similar way to the mterf proteins in metazoans . tobacco proteins encoded by the _LOCATION_ genes clpp _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and several components of the translational machinery have been shown to be essential for cell viability . our data suggest that a major deficiency of protein translation exists in bsm _LOCATION_ . to understand why bsm cells are still viable we applied genetic tests to investigate a possible functional redundancy in the _PROTEIN_ gene function . the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ gene encodes the _PROTEIN_ subunit of the heteromeric acetyl coa _PROTEIN_ whereas the other three subunits are encoded by the _LOCATION_ cac genes . he acc produces malonyl coa that is used for de novo biosynthesis of fatty acids which in plant cells occurs almost exclusively in _LOCATION_ . however because bsm cells are viable mutant _LOCATION_ most probably have sufficient malonyl coa for fatty acid synthesis . indeed analysis of fatty acid composition and content of albino bsm/bsm cells showed that there were no significant differences between mutant and wt cells except for lower levels of polyunsaturated fatty acid in the mutant and a correspondingly higher level of stearic acid and oleic acid . malonyl coa in _LOCATION_ can also be synthesized by the eukaryotic type homomeric acc . analysis of sequenced plant genomes indicates that three groups of plant species exist _PROTEIN_ the capacity for malonyl coa biosynthesis . some species depend exclusively on an he acc others rely only on an ho acc and some use both enzymes . the arabidopsis genome contains two genes for ho acc that are positioned on chromosome in a tandem duplication . the _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ enzyme . compared with _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ encoded by the gene _GENE_ is aa residues longer at the n terminus . the current gene model indicates that _GENE_ can produce two proteins but only the aa long _PROTEIN_ is expected to be fully active . the functional significance of the alternatively spliced c terminally truncated _PROTEIN_ is unclear . we produced _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in leaf protoplasts and both protein fusions localized to the chloroplasts suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is indeed a _LOCATION_ protein . to assess whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interact genetically we confirmed two t dna insertion mutations in the _PROTEIN_ gene as annotated in the salk institute mutant collection . t dnas were located in the and exon of the mutant _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ gene alleles respectively . homozygous _PROTEIN_ plants had no obvious mutant phenotype compared with the wt indicating that he acc is the major _LOCATION_ acetyl coa _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . embryos from flowering _PROTEIN_ bsm/bsm or _PROTEIN_ bsm/bsm plants were compared with _PROTEIN_ bsm/bsm plants that had been selected among the same segregating populations . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ embryo arrested earlier than the _PROTEIN_ embryos and in addition seeds with arrested _PROTEIN_ embryos did not germinate in vitro indicating synthetic lethality between the bsm and _PROTEIN_ mutations . hence _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ can not compensate for a deficiency in _LOCATION_ malonyl coa biosynthesis in bsm _LOCATION_ and functional redundancy in malonyl coa biosynthesis in _LOCATION_ of arabidopsis promotes bsm cell survival . the bsm cell proliferation defects were partially alleviated by external application of cytokinin and auxin . because phytohormones have a systemic action we wondered whether our results were indicative of a noncell autonomous function of _LOCATION_ during development . therefore we characterized postembryonic mutant phenotypes in mosaic plants generated by heat inducible cre loxp recombination . when _PROTEIN_ gene loss was induced in wk old plants grown on soil leaves preformed at the time of heat shock application remained green . young leaf primordia at the time of the heat shock however developed a proximo distal gradient of pigment deficiency . the subsequent three to four leaf primordia developed serrated small albino leaves and the youngest emerging leaves were rod like albino structures . mosaics were photoautotrophic plants that often developed large _METHOD_ of short albino shoots . heat stress applied to to wk old plants resulted in the development of mosaics with albino inflorescence shoots . albino flowers on primary shoots had sepals _PROTEIN_ anthers and carpels whereas in flowers of side shoots only filamentous structures usually developed instead of the internal whorls of _PROTEIN_ and anthers . no seeds were obtained after either self pollination or cross pollination with wt pollen indicating major _METHOD_ with gametophyte development . to characterize the timing of _PROTEIN_ decay after induction of gene deletion the fate of _PROTEIN_ tap was analyzed . _PROTEIN_ protein had a half life of d in green leaves of mosaics but was undetectable in albino tissues . therefore the relative stability of the _PROTEIN_ protein present at the time of heat shock application _PROTEIN_ wt functionality in green tissues suggesting that wt _LOCATION_ in mosaic plants produce growth promoting substances that had not been supplied to the in vitro grown bsm cells . characterization of foliar cell types showed that significantly less mesophyll cells were present in albino leaves and whereas stomata complex cells and trichomes were recognizable the epidermis pavement cells did not attain a wt interlocking jigsaw puzzle shape . in albino leaves mutant bsm _LOCATION_ differentiated as double _LOCATION_ bound often doughnut shaped small organelles without a developed _LOCATION_ system . albino leaves were also found to accumulate several abundant polypeptides identified as thioglucoside _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ or myrosinases . in arabidopsis myrosinases are specific markers of the myrosin cells of vascular bundles and guard cells of the stomata complex . _PROTEIN_ is also required for key abscisic acid responses of guard cells . the observed proteome phenotype was not however caused by ectopic gene activation .
the ecotypes and genetic markers were _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ bsm/bsm col _PROTEIN_ and col _PROTEIN_ . plants were grown as described . mutant cell/shoot bsm/bsm lines were _PROTEIN_ on a shoot inducing medium _METHOD_ . to induce mosaics plants were heat stressed at . _METHOD_ protein fusions were _PROTEIN_ transiently . tissue sections were analyzed by light and transmission em embryos were analyzed by nomarski optics and protoplasts in isotonic solutions epidermis peels or hand sections of leaves in water were analyzed by laser scanning confocal microscopy . surface morphology was examined with a tabletop electron microscope tm . sequences were analyzed as described . _PROTEIN_ recombinational cloning was used routinely . mterf primer sequences are in table . the binary vector for mosaic analysis was . lipids were extracted from mutant and wt calli and their fatty acid compositions and contents were quantified through their methyl esters as described . the nativepage novex bis tris gel system was used for bn _PROTEIN_ . tap tags were visualized with the peroxidase antiperoxidase soluble complex at a dilution . the _METHOD_ antigen was detected with diluted primary rabbit anti _METHOD_ antibody and diluted secondary ecl anti rabbit igg horseradish peroxidase linked whole antibody from donkey . peroxidase activity was detected with the western lightning chemiluminescence reagent plus and high performance chemiluminescent film hyperfilm ecl . labeled dna probes were prepared with the _LOCATION_ acid labeling readiprime ii random prime labeling system . gene fragments for labeling were amplified by pcr with gene specific primers .
