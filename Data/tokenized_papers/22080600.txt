an arabidopsis thaliana mutant with an altered structure of its hemicellulose xyloglucan identified by a forward genetic screen facilitating oligosaccharide _METHOD_ profiling was characterized . _PROTEIN_ exhibits increased xyg fucosylation and the occurrence of xyg fragments not present in the wild type plant . _PROTEIN_ was identified to encode an fucosidase acting on xyg that was previously designated _PROTEIN_ . green _METHOD_ protein fusion localization studies and analysis of nascent xyg in microsomal preparations demonstrated that this glycosylhydrolase acts _PROTEIN_ on xyg in the apoplast . detailed structural analysis of xyg in _PROTEIN_ gave unique insights into the role of the fucosidase in xyg metabolism in vivo . the genetic evidence indicates that the activity of glycosylhydrolases in the apoplast plays a major role in generating the heterogeneity of xyg side chains in the wall . furthermore without the dominant apoplastic glycosylhydrolases the xyg structure in the wall is _PROTEIN_ composed of xxxg and xxfg subunits .
screening of an ethyl methanesulfonate _METHOD_ mutagenized plant population by oligosaccharide _METHOD_ profiling identified a mutant termed _PROTEIN_ that exhibit significant changes in its xyg structure . _PROTEIN_ showed increased abundance of fucosylated xyg oligosaccharides but more importantly olimp indicated ions representing oligosaccharides that have not been observed in wild type olimp spectra . the gene responsible for the observed xyg oligosaccharide phenotype in _PROTEIN_ mutants was isolated using a combination of strategies . initially an _PROTEIN_ mapping population was established by crossing _PROTEIN_ to the arabidopsis landsberg _LOCATION_ ecotype . after self pollination the resulting hypocotyls were subjected to xyg olimp . out of hypocotyls displayed wild type col xyg profiles while showed the characteristic _PROTEIN_ xyg profile . a value of is consistent with a segregation ratio model indicative of a _LOCATION_ encoded monogenic recessive trait . to narrow down the genomic region of the responsible mutation a bulk segregant analysis by a microarray based mapping approach was performed . the analysis of the hybridization data pinpointed the mutation to the distal end of chromosome iv between and mbp . further fine mapping performed by pcr based mapping of individual recombinants delimited the mutation between marker at position mb and _PROTEIN_ at mb . this genomic region encompasses genes all of which were sequenced in _PROTEIN_ . a point mutation was identified in the locus _GENE_ resulting in a premature stop codon in the third exon of the gene _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in the olimp screen several mutants with the _PROTEIN_ phenotype were found and _GENE_ was sequenced in all those mutants . all _PROTEIN_ mutants exhibit mutations in this gene locus including mis sense mutations _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and additional non sense mutations _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to confirm further that _GENE_ coincides with the _PROTEIN_ locus t dna insertion lines were obtained _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and their xyg olimp phenotype determined . whereas the _PROTEIN_ transcript is still present in those lines albeit in reduced abundance both displayed the characteristic _PROTEIN_ xyg oligosaccharide profile of a higher abundance of fucosylated oligosaccharides and the presence of the unusual oligosaccharides . in addition the genomic sequence of wild type _PROTEIN_ was placed under the control of the constitutive promoter and transformed into col . indeed the xyg oligosaccharide profile was restored to the wild type in _METHOD_ of absence of unusual oligosaccharides and a reduction xyg fucosylation level . in summary these data provide conclusive evidence that _PROTEIN_ is represented by _GENE_ . _PROTEIN_ encodes a protein consisting of amino acids with a calculated molecular _METHOD_ of kd including a potential amino acid signal peptide . the protein is not predicted to contain any transmembrane domains or a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor . _PROTEIN_ has been designated _PROTEIN_ as it belongs to a glycosylhydrolase family . when _PROTEIN_ heterologously in tobacco it exhibits fucosidase activity not only against a model compound fucosyl lactose but also against xyg oligosaccharides as it converts xxfg to xxlg and releases fucosyl residues from the xyg polymer . this designation is consistent with the observed increase in fucosylated xyg oligosaccharides in the _PROTEIN_ mutants due to a nonfunctional fucosidase . hence the impact of _PROTEIN_ on overall fucosidase activity present in arabidopsis was assessed . protein extracts from various _PROTEIN_ mutants _METHOD_ were tested for fucosidase activity against fucosyl lactose indeed a > drop in activity was observed in all mutants . the data provide further evidence that _PROTEIN_ encodes a fucosidase represented by _GENE_ . by contrast constitutive _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ led to a fold increase in fucosidase activity in plant extracts . the dominance of _PROTEIN_ as a source of plant fucosidase activity is consistent with its ubiquitous _PROTEIN_ as shown by _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ fusion analysis . in etiolated seedlings where the _PROTEIN_ xyg oligosaccharide phenotype was observed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to be _PROTEIN_ in all tissues including all cell layers of the hypocotyl . in adult plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to be strongest in vascular tissue in leaf trichomes in the root elongation zone and in emerging _PROTEIN_ roots but it is also present in other tissues at a low level . consistent with the ubiquitous _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is the data obtained from xyg olimp analysis of various plant tissues demonstrating the presence of the _PROTEIN_ structural xyg phenotype higher fucosylation levels and unusual xyg oligosaccharides in leaves and flowers . the subcellular localization of the fucosidase _PROTEIN_ was investigated by transient _PROTEIN_ of its green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion constructs in tobacco epidermal cells . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion was present in the apoplast and was retained in the apoplast when the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as indicated by the marker fm receded under plasmolysis inducing conditions . these experiments confirmed earlier reports that _PROTEIN_ represents a soluble protein and that plant fucosidase activities can be found in apoplastic extracts of plants . apoplastic proteins are translated into the lumen of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ transiently move through the _LOCATION_ apparatus and are exported via exocytosis into the apoplast . hence there is a possibility that the fucosidase protein might come in contact with xyg in the _LOCATION_ apparatus . to assess if the fucosidase acts on xyg in the _LOCATION_ a microsomal preparation was generated from etiolated seedlings essentially separating microsomes from the cell wall . the xyg structure in both fractions was assessed by olimp . both fractions harbor similar xyg oligosaccharide structures in _PROTEIN_ . however in the wild type wall preparation fucosylated xyg oligosaccharides are reduced in relative abundance compared with the microsomal preparations . this is consistent with the action of a fucosidase in the apoplast . _PROTEIN_ microsomes contain a higher degree of fucosylated xyg oligosaccharides than do col microsomes suggesting that the fucosidase can act to some extent already in the microsomes . however it appears that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ active in the apoplast as wall xyg from _PROTEIN_ contains more fucosylated xyg oligosaccharides compared with col . furthermore the abundance of fucosylated xyg oligosaccharides in the _PROTEIN_ mutant remains constant in the wall fraction compared with the microsome fraction again consistent with a lack of apoplastic fucosidase action . in summary the data are consistent with _PROTEIN_ representing an fucosidase that acts on xyg once deposited in the cell wall . furthermore the unusual oligosaccharides present in _PROTEIN_ occur only in the wall fraction not the microsomal fraction indicating that they arise through metabolism of xyg in the apoplast rather than biosynthesis in the _LOCATION_ apparatus . the xyg structure in _PROTEIN_ is distinctly different from wild type xyg in three aspects . an increase in the fucosylated xyg oligosaccharide xxfg is observed along with a concomitant _PROTEIN_ in the abundance of xxlg and unusual small xeg generated ions _METHOD_ that are not present in wild type xeg extracts with m/z and . in addition when extending the _METHOD_ range of the _METHOD_ spectrometer other xeg generated ions appear that are much larger than the usual xyg oligosaccharides found in plants with m/z of and . to determine the structure of the unusual small xyg oligosaccharides an attempt was made to purify or at least enrich them for subsequent analysis . using a combination of size exclusion chromatography followed by reversed phase chromatography fractions could be collected whose major components were these unusual xyg oligosaccharides in the case of fraction m/z and in the case of fraction m/z coeluting with the regular xyg oligosaccharides m/z and . the _METHOD_ of all four unusual ions is consistent with a sugar composition of a single deoxyhexose one or two pentoses presumably xyl and various contents of hexoses . since _METHOD_ can not determine the nature of the deoxyhexosyl or hexosyl residues nmr was used on the two fractions to gain further insight into the structures of these unusual oligosaccharides . the nmr spectrum of the wild type xyg oligosaccharides contained resonances at and diagnostic for the presence of the l fucp d galp d xylp side chain at of a d glcp residue at any position in the oligosaccharide except the nonreducing end . the spectrum of the _PROTEIN_ xyg oligosaccharides contained these resonances along with additional resonances diagnostic for the presence of structures such as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which have fucosylated side chains at of the d glcp residue at the nonreducing end . based on this information the most probable structure for is _PROTEIN_ . furthermore the spectrum of the _PROTEIN_ xyg oligosaccharides contains a resonance at characteristic of a nonreducing terminal glc linked to a glc residue bearing a fucosylated side chain such as in gfg which has been isolated from apple xyg . these resonances are consistent with the structure gfg for the oligosaccharide with the composition . however the presence of the structure _PROTEIN_ can not be ruled out without purification of the oligosaccharides . similarly the oligosaccharide may correspond to the structures gfgg ggfg and/or _PROTEIN_ . the nmr spectrum of fraction is very similar to a control xyg oligosaccharide sample obtained by xeg digest of wild type walls . this is not surprising as the major xyg oligosaccharides are xxxg and xlxg/xxlg . however it also contains resonances at and characteristic of oligosaccharides with a fucosylated side chain at of the d glcp residue next to the reducing end . based on the nmr data the most probable structure for the oligosaccharide in this fraction is xfg . in summary the unusual xyg oligosaccharides present in _PROTEIN_ do not appear to be novel xyg structures but rather truncated versions of fucosylated xyg oligosaccharides with backbone structures having fewer than the usual four _PROTEIN_ units . the data also indicate that the xyl content of the _PROTEIN_ xyg is reduced compared with the wild type . an attempt was made to elucidate the structures of the large unusual xeg released xyg oligosaccharides not found in wild type arabidopsis . it was noted that while these oligosaccharides are present after an xeg digest of _PROTEIN_ walls they were absent when digesting _PROTEIN_ wall preparations with a commercial endo _PROTEIN_ . other features of the _PROTEIN_ xyg structure remained upon eg digestion . in particular the unusual xyg oligomer consistent with a structure of gfg was very prevalent . therefore the large xyg oligosaccharides have structural properties that allow them to be hydrolyzed with eg but not xeg . using high performance anion exchange chromatography with subsequent _PROTEIN_ assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight analysis a fraction could be collected that was enriched in these larger xyg oligosaccharides . based on the _METHOD_ the likely side chain composition could be assigned . when using these putative compositions the oligosaccharides would have a backbone of between six and seven _PROTEIN_ units . however the order of the side chains could not be ascertained by _METHOD_ to gain more insight into the order of the side chains the enriched large xyg oligosaccharides were reduced with deuterated to their respective alditols specifically labeling the reducing end of the large oligosaccharides . they were then digested with eg . the ions of the resulting reduced xyg oligosaccharides are consistent with the regular xyg oligosaccharides found in arabidopsis xyg xxxg and xxfg . the resulting nonreduced xyg is consistent with the unusual xyg oligosaccharides observed in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and gfg . one oligosaccharide consistent with xfg was found in both reduced and unreduced form . hence the likely structures of the large xyg oligosaccharides are _PROTEIN_ xxxg or _PROTEIN_ xxfg gfg xxxg or gfg xxfg or xfg xfg and gfg xfg . all of those cases have in common that a fucosylated xyg fragment resides on the nonreducing end and an oligosaccharide with an x residue on the reducing end . however whereas these are the most likely side chain scenarios other side chain distributions can not be excluded . in any case it is clear that the large unusual xyg fragments contain the smaller unusual xyg fragments not present in arabidopsis wild type walls . the absolute amount of xyg present in the walls can be determined by hpaec pulsed amperometric detection _PROTEIN_ using an xxxg standard curve . since xeg does not release all xyg present in the walls an extraction with alkali was performed to capture the structure of as much xyg as possible . based on these data the total amount of the unusual xyg fragments make up of all xyg oligosaccharides released by enzyme . total xyg stripped of microfibrils using alkali contain only of these xyg fragments while xyg in the alkali fraction after enzymatic predigestion contains only of these fragments . hence the fragments are dominant in an enzyme accessible domain of xyg in the wall hinting that they might be derived through apoplastic enzymes . whereas the total amount of xyg present in the wall is not significantly different between wild type and _PROTEIN_ walls there is a significantly larger proportion of xyg that can be extracted with the enzyme xeg from _PROTEIN_ walls and a concomitant lower amount of xyg remaining in the wall after the enzyme pretreatment . therefore inactivating a fucosidase as in _PROTEIN_ leads to an increase in enzyme accessible xyg . quantification of xyg oligosaccharides of etiolated seedlings by hpaec _PROTEIN_ the dominant structural feature of _PROTEIN_ xyg is its increase in fucosylation . given the lack of a fucosidase activity in _PROTEIN_ this is not surprising . the total amount of fucosylated xyg oligosaccharides including the unusual fucosylated xyg fragments is increased from in wild type arabidopsis xyg to in _PROTEIN_ xyg . this increase is independent of the xyg domain as the enzyme accessible domain _PROTEIN_ and the remaining alkali extractable domain display an increase in fucosylation . the quantitative analysis of xyg oligosaccharides by hpaec allows also the separation of the structural isomers xlxg and xxlg unlike _METHOD_ methods such as olimp . the oligosaccharide xxlg is drastically reduced in _PROTEIN_ compared with wild type seedling walls by in total alkali extractable xyg again in both xyg domains in the xeg accessible domain and in the xyg domain closely attached to the cellulose microfibrils . the origin of the unusual xyg oligosaccharides was assessed using a genetic approach . one hypothesis is that these fragments are the result of partial degradation of xyg . for this to occur other glycosidases would be necessary . one prominent glycosidase would be an xylosidase as this enzyme is the first enzyme to remove the xylosyl residue from the nonreducing end of a xyg polymer or oligomer . therefore _PROTEIN_ the fucosidase mutant was crossed with _PROTEIN_ a mutant with an inactive xyg xylosidase . xyg analysis by olimp and hpaec of the double mutant indicated a complete lack of the unusual xyg fragments . hence the xylosidase is required for generating these fragments . the _PROTEIN_ xyg phenotype with a higher degree of fucosylation still prevails in the double mutant . xyg in the xylosidase mutant _PROTEIN_ can be extracted to a larger extent both with enzyme and alkali . while still present in the double mutant in total alkali extracted xyg and each xyg domain it does not reach the high amounts as in _PROTEIN_ alone . the overall cell wall structure of the _PROTEIN_ mutants was assessed beyond xyg . the monosaccharide composition of the _PROTEIN_ polysaccharides showed an increase in wall fuc levels in all _PROTEIN_ alleles tested and a corresponding _PROTEIN_ in wall fuc levels in the _PROTEIN_ overexpression line . other significant changes were not consistent in all _PROTEIN_ alleles . hence based on wall monosaccharide compositional analysis there is no evidence of an alteration of the structure or abundance of any wall polymer other than xyg . all axy mutants mentioned here with the exception of _PROTEIN_ which has shorter siliques and lower seed set as previously described did not differ from arabidopsis wild type plants in _METHOD_ of growth morphology of seedlings or adult plants . the _PROTEIN_ phenotype prevailed in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant indicating that an apparent lack of a fucosidase does not have any impact positive or negative on this phenotype .
