bundles cortical microtubules and we examined how this property is regulated during division in time lapse studies of arabidopsis suspension cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . spindle _METHOD_ is diffuse during metaphase restored to the central spindle at anaphase and then compacted at the midline during _PROTEIN_ anaphase/early telophase . however mutagenesis of the microtubule associated protein consensus cdk site to a non phosphorylatable form allows premature decoration of microtubules traversing the central region of the metaphase spindle without affecting the timing of the subsequent compaction . this suggests that mutagenesis does not affect compaction but does affect a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation switch that normally targets to the central spindle at the metaphase/anaphase transition . _METHOD_ continues to label the midline of the early phragmoplast suggesting a structural continuity with the central spindle both structures being composed of anti parallel microtubules . however once the cytokinetic apparatus expands into a _PROTEIN_ the map becomes depleted at the midline . despite this cytokinesis is not arrested and _LOCATION_ and callose are deposited at the cell plate . it is concluded that plays a role in the central spindle at anaphase to early cytokinesis but is not essential at the midline of the phragmoplast at _PROTEIN_ stages .
first to establish that the _PROTEIN_ protein was capable of bundling microtubules in this cell system in vivo we examined transiently infected arabidopsis suspension cells during interphase . figure shows the fusion protein has a dramatic effect on the bundling of interphase microtubules . it induces excessive bundling of both the cortical and the _LOCATION_ associated radial microtubule arrays drawing the normally evenly distributed microtubules into only a few groups . figure shows that this enhanced bundling occurs in cells containing longitudinal as well as transverse arrays . by contrast untransformed control cells stained with anti tubulin antibodies did not contain bundled microtubules nor did cells transformed with another fusion protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ figure illustrates a cortical array and figure illustrates a radial array in which microtubules emerge from the _LOCATION_ surface . by tracking cells undergoing cell division at min time intervals it was possible to demonstrate that _METHOD_ was both spatially and temporally regulated during mitosis and cytokinesis . regulation was first observed at prometaphase/metaphase in that spindle labelling was diminished as shown in the _METHOD_ study of citation and figure . in contrast to the clearly labelled cortical and _PROTEIN_ microtubules it became difficult at prometaphase/metaphase to discern specific microtubule _METHOD_ against the dim outline of the spindle . the diminution was most clearly seen by comparing _METHOD_ levels within a time lapse series not by single images taken from different cells at different microscope settings . _METHOD_ intensity measurements of three such cells that could be tracked from preprophase through to cytokinesis confirmed that while the _PROTEIN_ was times brighter than the general cytoplasm the _METHOD_ in the region of the prophase/metaphase spindle was only times brighter than the cytoplasmic level . clear fibrillar _METHOD_ patterns then reappeared in early anaphase in the central spindle region . then during _PROTEIN_ anaphase the _METHOD_ became concentrated in a zone in the midline amongst the phragmoplast initials . the midline labelling was however transient as it then redistributed amongst the microtubules of the two phragmoplast halves leaving a zone depleted of labelling in the midline as the phragmoplast matured . this compaction of label at the _PROTEIN_ anaphase/telophase transition is better illustrated in figure . we tested whether these cell cycle specific staining patterns represented changes in protein level or cellular distribution of _METHOD_ by measuring the _METHOD_ intensities of the _LOCATION_ region of cells as they underwent spindle morphogenesis . however despite the _PROTEIN_ that the spindle associated _METHOD_ was times higher than the cytoplasmic level at early anaphase and times higher at _PROTEIN_ anaphase the total level of _METHOD_ hardly varied . from metaphase to early anaphase the _METHOD_ signal only varied by and from early anaphase to _PROTEIN_ anaphase/telophase by . this suggests that the changed labelling pattern is due to a redistribution rather than a general increase in the amount of _METHOD_ protein . in view of the time lapse data showing that the labelling of the metaphase spindle by _METHOD_ was diminished compared to the rest of mitosis we examined the possibility that the map was modified at this stage . citation have examined the role of cdk in regulating the homologue _PROTEIN_ during division and citation examined this further by mutagenizing the consensus cdk sites . we therefore mutagenized the corresponding consensus cdk phosphorylation site of between amino acid residues and p x . we mutated serine to non phosphorylatable alanine and transfected arabidopsis cells with the _METHOD_ mutant . the mutated was still able to induce heavy bundling of cortical microtubules and these cells could be shown to complete division . overall the mutated _METHOD_ showed a similar pattern of decoration to the control in that the spindle labelling was less intense than on the preprophase band but then concentrated again on the midzone of the nascent phragmoplast at the _PROTEIN_ anaphase to telophase transition . the timings were also similar in both cases . by tracking three cells at min time intervals we found that it took an average of min for control cells to progress from prometaphase _PROTEIN_ to a stage in _PROTEIN_ anaphase and it took min for the mutant . the intense discrete labelling in the central spindle region then redistributed within min in the control versus min in the mutant background . however there was a qualitative difference in the staining pattern of spindles . spindles labelled by mutant _METHOD_ produced a fibrous staining pattern in the central region of the spindle throughout spindle morphogenesis in contrast to control cells in which unmutagenized fusion protein only appeared to accumulate at the central spindle from anaphase onwards . this difference is particularly evident in the detailed sequence of spindle morphogenesis illustrated in figure . mutant _METHOD_ labelled fibres of the central spindle region within min of _PROTEIN_ breakdown whereas it took an average of min in the sampled wild type cells . this early targeting of mutant _METHOD_ to the central spindle was also investigated by taking _METHOD_ profiles along the spindle axis . figure compares the profiles of _METHOD_ versus mutant _METHOD_ spindles min after the disappearance of the _PROTEIN_ . as can be seen _METHOD_ yielded relatively flat traces across the spindle axis consistent with the staining pattern being diffuse and non _PROTEIN_ at this stage . by contrast the _METHOD_ in _METHOD_ mutant cells was more focused to the centre of the spindle consistent with the presence of fibrous staining patterns in this area . antibodies to have shown that the protein is concentrated in the midzone of the phragmoplast but in the present study overexpression changed this phenotype . in transformed cells _METHOD_ was not concentrated in the midline but appeared to label the entire phragmoplast . notably the fusion protein induced extensive microtubule bundling during cytokinesis normally the phragmoplast microtubules are difficult to resolve but overexpression caused them to be drawn into countable bundles . this bundling was apparent at all stages of cytokinesis from _PROTEIN_ anaphase to the _PROTEIN_ stage of phragmoplast expansion depicted in figure . overexpression of _METHOD_ also promoted the bundling of the aster like microtubules that interact with the cell cortex . movie and figure show that despite the bundling of the phragmoplast microtubules and the poor/non labelling of the midline the cytokinetic apparatus was still capable of centrifugal outgrowth and transition to interphase . these data suggest that it may not be essential for to be compacted at the midline of the phragmoplast for the cytokinetic apparatus to expand . to check whether cells plates were actually deposited under such conditions transfected cells were stained with the _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ dye which has been shown to label _LOCATION_ of forming cell plates in plant suspension cells . figure shows the _METHOD_ signal of a cell undergoing a _PROTEIN_ form of cytokinesis where the phragmoplast has already contacted the mother wall at the left . the leading edge of the phragmoplast to the right is marked by abnormal curled microtubule bundles and in figure the staining of the same cell shows that membranous material is contributing to the formation of the cell plate that has contacted the left hand wall of the mother cell . to check that the membranous disk contained cell plate polysaccharide transformed cells were stained with the callose dye aniline blue . figure _METHOD_ that forming and completed cell plates contain disk shaped deposits of aniline blue positive material .
