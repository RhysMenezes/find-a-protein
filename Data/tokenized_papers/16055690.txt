previously in an effort to better understand the male contribution to fertilization we completed a maize sperm _PROTEIN_ sequence tag project . here we used this resource to identify promoters that would direct gene _PROTEIN_ in sperm cells . we used reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction to identify probable sperm specific transcripts in maize and then identified their best sequence matches in the arabidopsis genome . we tested five different arabidopsis promoters for cell specificity using an enhanced green _METHOD_ protein reporter gene . in pollen the _PROTEIN_ promoter is active in the sperm cells and not in the progenitor generative cell or in the vegetative cell but it is also active in ovules roots and guard cells . the _PROTEIN_ promoter is active only in the sperm cells and in the progenitor generative cell but not in the vegetative cell or in other tissues . a third promoter _PROTEIN_ was active in the vegetative cell during the _PROTEIN_ stages of pollen development the other promoters tested did not function in pollen . comparisons among _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ homologs from maize rice arabidopsis and poplar revealed a core binding site for dof transcription _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ promoters will be useful for manipulating gene _PROTEIN_ in sperm cells for localization and functional analyses of sperm proteins and for imaging of sperm dynamics as they are transported in the pollen tube to the embryo sac .
we previously reported the analysis of eight maize sperm transcripts that had similarity to hypothetical or unknown arabidopsis proteins and demonstrated by in situ hybridization that one of these transcripts was sperm specific in the mature pollen grain . here we used reverse transcription pcr analysis to test an additional transcripts from the maize sperm ests for their _PROTEIN_ patterns in maize . we focused on transcripts whose deduced amino acid sequences were similar to hypothetical arabidopsis proteins . sperm specific transcripts are probably poorly represented in cdna libraries prepared from inflorescences or flowers we therefore reasoned that genes without est support in arabidopsis might be sperm specific . we also tested transcripts that were present several times in the maize sperm est database but were not represented in other maize est databases . rt pcr was carried out on random primed rna from mature pollen unpollinated ear unpollinated silks seedlings and root . we identified transcripts that were _PROTEIN_ primarily in pollen . these transcripts were examined further by rt pcr analysis using rna prepared from different developmental stages i.e . isolated unicellular microspores bicellular and tricellular pollen grains and _METHOD_ activated cell sorted sperm cells . we identified transcripts that appeared to be sperm specific in mature pollen grains or were _PROTEIN_ primarily in isolated sperm cells . while maize is an excellent system for gamete isolation it is not easy to transform . we were interested in examining gamete gene _PROTEIN_ in a more easily manipulated plant . we started with the maize ests that appeared to be sperm specific and then identified arabidopsis genes whose deduced protein sequences were the best amino acid match to the deduced protein sequences of these maize ests . occasionally the maize ests had limited coding sequence so we first identified a similar gene from rice and then used the rice gene to identify the most similar arabidopsis gene . this was particularly important for transcripts such as _METHOD_ where most of the maize sperm est was from the untranslated region . an arabidopsis gene without est support could not be found for all of the maize transcripts but we identified arabidopsis genes for testing in some cases two arabidopsis genes that were both similar to one maize transcript were tested . we determined the _PROTEIN_ patterns for these arabidopsis genes using rt pcr . figure shows the analysis of the five transcripts that appeared to be present predominately in rna isolated from bud flower or pollen while supplemental figure shows the analysis of the other transcripts . _GENE_ and _GENE_ are both similar to _METHOD_ . the _METHOD_ transcript was shown to be present in sperm cells by in situ hybridization on pollen grains . the _GENE_ transcript was present primarily in unopened buds while the _GENE_ transcript was present in mature pollen unopened buds open flower pistils and detectable in leaves . _GENE_ is similar to _METHOD_ it was present in pollen and seedlings . the _GENE_ transcript is similar to _METHOD_ and was present in mature pollen and flowers . the _GENE_ transcript is similar to a contig composed of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ and was present in mature pollen buds and open flowers . the _PROTEIN_ patterns for _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ in maize were reported . briefly _METHOD_ was present in all stages of pollen development and also showed some _PROTEIN_ in silks . _METHOD_ was present primarily in isolated facs sorted sperm cells and was detectable in mature pollen . the _METHOD_ transcript was strongly _PROTEIN_ in facs sorted sperm cells but it was also present to a lesser extent in the unicellular and mature pollen samples . because these five arabidopsis genes appeared to be _PROTEIN_ in pollen or unopened buds we tested whether any of their promoters would confer _PROTEIN_ in sperm cells in vivo . accordingly sequences upstream of the putative initiating met for each gene were amplified by pcr and cloned in front of the _METHOD_ coding region . arabidopsis plants were transformed and the primary transformants were examined for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ during pollen development . numerous plants containing the _GENE_ _METHOD_ and _GENE_ _METHOD_ constructs showed no _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in any tissue examined .this was unexpected because _GENE_ was _PROTEIN_ in buds and _GENE_ was _PROTEIN_ in pollen perhaps the promoter fragments used were not long enough or the _PROTEIN_ level was too weak . nonetheless figure shows that the other three promoters tested did _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the pollen grain and that two directed _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ in the sperm cells . we named these two genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the vegetative cell _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ promoter was vegetative cell specific in pollen . in tricellular pollen both the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the sperm cells . we wanted to determine whether the promoters were active only in the sperm cells or if transcription was initiated earlier in pollen development . this question was relevant because by rt pcr analysis we had found that a number of the maize sperm transcripts that were _PROTEIN_ in the sperm cells were also present at the unicellular and bicellular stages of pollen development . to examine the developmental pattern of _PROTEIN_ anthers were dissected the pollen was stained with diamino phenylindole to determine the developmental stage and then the pollen was examined for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . in pollen the _PROTEIN_ promoter is only active in mature sperm cells _METHOD_ and not in bicellular pollen or unicellular pollen . because the _PROTEIN_ promoter is not active in earlier stages of development these results suggest that transcription and translation of the transgene must occur in the sperm cells . the _PROTEIN_ promoter also drives _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ in the ovules roots and guard cells . in plants with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ in sperm cells was seen _METHOD_ but this promoter apparently initiates _PROTEIN_ at the bicellular stage of pollen development because _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was also seen in generative cells . dapi staining showed two _LOCATION_ one brightly staining and one diffusely staining . for both constructs some green _METHOD_ was seen at an earlier stage of pollen development . we believe this is _METHOD_ and not _METHOD_ because the _METHOD_ is present in all of the pollen grains _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ even in heterozygous plants and more importantly it is present in wild type plants . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is not _PROTEIN_ in any other tissues . the _PROTEIN_ promoter was active in the vegetative cell of the pollen grain in tricellular pollen grains _METHOD_ and weakly active in bicellular pollen grains however _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was not observed in unicellular pollen . in addition to the spatial variations observed with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs we occasionally observed a low level of greenish _METHOD_ in the vegetative cell of mature pollen this _PROTEIN_ appeared in addition to the sperm cell _PROTEIN_ . the pollen grains shown in figure a and c are from different flowers on the same _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plant examined on the same day . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct only contained the putative promoter region so we tested if the of the _PROTEIN_ gene would affect the _PROTEIN_ or translation of _METHOD_ in the pollen grains . however _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in plants transformed with a construct containing the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was not appreciably different from that in plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the control of the promoter region alone . we saw the same sporadic _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants figure b and d shows _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ pollen from the same plant examined on different days . over the course of several months we examined whether developmental stage time of collection heat treatment or repeated desiccation influenced this greenish _METHOD_ in the vegetative cell but none of these _PROTEIN_ correlated with it . pollen from wild type plants grown side by side with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants occasionally exhibited greenish _METHOD_ thus the sporadic _METHOD_ in the vegetative cell is not true _PROTEIN_ of the transgene from the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ promoters but is _METHOD_ . the _PROTEIN_ promoter has lower _PROTEIN_ levels overall than the _PROTEIN_ promoter and has variable _PROTEIN_ even in homozygous lines . this is most obvious in a quartet background where all of the pollen grains from one meiosis remain attached to each other . figure shows pollen from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants in the quartet background . figure shows quartets from a plant that is heterozygous for the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene sperm cells are visible in only one or two pollen grains in the quartet . the variable _PROTEIN_ is also present in plants homozygous for the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene . figure shows two quartets in one sperm cells are visible in all four pollen grains as expected while in the other sperm cells are only visible in three pollen grains . by contrast the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is fully penetrant the heterozygous plants always have two pollen grains with green sperm in each quartet while in homozygous plants all of the pollen grains have _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the sperm cells . these patterns of _PROTEIN_ were consistent in the six independent _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines and in the more than independent _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines we analyzed suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ differences between the promoters are not the result of position effects . transmission electron microscopy studies of sperm cells have revealed the subcellular organization of the sperm cells and their close association with the vegetative cell _LOCATION_ . however such studies give only a static picture . by contrast _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ allows imaging of live sperm cells over time and reveals that the sperm cells are highly dynamic . in living cells when the promoter is used to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ it is possible to see sperm shadows within the _METHOD_ green vegetative cell . the _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ in the cytoplasm of the sperm cells allows visualization of sperm morphology that is significantly superior to that possible after dapi staining of sperm _LOCATION_ or with _LOCATION_ targeted _METHOD_ protein markers . figure shows cytoplasmic _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in sperm cells . figure is the same pollen grain stained with dapi so that the sperm _LOCATION_ are visible . the superimposition of these images clearly illustrates the differences between imaging the cytoplasm and the _LOCATION_ of the sperm cells . figure e to t shows examples _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ of the vastly different morphologies of the sperm cells in vivo similar images are obtained with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ pollen . note the tail like cytoplasmic extension of the sperm cells as well as the _LOCATION_ shadows within the sperm cells . these images contradict the common perception that sperm cells are largely a _LOCATION_ with minimal cytoplasm . unlike the sperm cells in vivo sperm cells released from broken pollen grains are round . supplemental figure a to d are time lapse movies . the movement of sperm is highly dynamic as the cells can be seen going up and down in the pollen tube and moving around within the pollen grain before entering the tube . the cytoplasmic extensions of the two sperm cells can be seen as well as their interaction with the vegetative _LOCATION_ . genes with common patterns of _PROTEIN_ frequently have common sequence motifs in their promoters . we wanted to determine if there were any common sequence motifs that might be responsible for sperm cell _PROTEIN_ . we compared _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to from lily to the putative maize promoter to the putative rice and promoters and to the putative poplar and promoters . the putative promoter was identified using the blast function at the maize genome assembly project . the _METHOD_ sequence was used to identify a maize assembled genomic island that contained the same sequence . successive searches using each identified magi to find an overlapping magi allowed us to isolate the entire coding region of the gene and kb upstream of the predicted initiating met . we called the region upstream of the predicted initiating met the putative promoter . there currently is no magi that contains the initiating met of the gene so we were unable to examine the putative promoter region from this gene . we used a database search to identify the rice proteins that were most similar to the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins . we then analyzed the kb regions upstream of the initiating met of these rice proteins . it has been reported that the promoter has a _PROTEIN_ box and a gc box but none of the other promoters examined had a gc box . the promoter also has a region similar to a g or t box with a core acgt motif this motif is often the target of _PROTEIN_ binding proteins . supplemental figure illustrates the relative location of the promoter elements identified in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ promoters . the _PROTEIN_ and promoters have an obvious _PROTEIN_ box and a ccaat box but the and the putative promoters do not have either . the _PROTEIN_ promoter does not have an obvious _PROTEIN_ box but does have a canonical ccaat box whereas the putative promoter has a _PROTEIN_ box but no ccaat box . the putative promoter lacks both a _PROTEIN_ and a ccaat box . a number of testis specific promoters from mammals are _PROTEIN_ less . like the _PROTEIN_ promoter has three core acgt binding sites the japonica putative promoter contains four of these core sites while the indica putative promoter has only two . has no acgt binding sites . all of the _PROTEIN_ promoter regions also contain acgt core motifs has four japonica has one indica has two has six and _PROTEIN_ has five . g boxes were found in the _PROTEIN_ promoter and in both putative promoters . a g box binding protein transcript was present several times in the maize sperm est sequences . additionally all of the _PROTEIN_ promoters contained at least one aaag sequence which is the core binding site for dof transcription _PROTEIN_ . interestingly the _PROTEIN_ promoter and the putative promoters of japonica indica and each have an aaag sequence located between bp and bp upstream of the translational start site . the _PROTEIN_ and the japonica and indica promoters also have an aaag sequence located within this same region however in the and promoters the aaag is located closer to the translational start site . the promoter also contained two of these motifs but they are outside of the region required for generative cell specific _PROTEIN_ . dof transcription _PROTEIN_ are known to interact with _PROTEIN_ binding proteins . no other common known motifs could be found among all of the promoters using visual inspection or the matinspector program from genomatixsuite with the plant cis acting regulatory dna elements database . we also compared the promoters of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to two other promoters known to drive _PROTEIN_ in sperm cells _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ all had an aagt/atc motif located approximately bp upstream of the translational start site however this consensus was not found in the rice maize or poplar gex promoters . an alignment of the rice maize sorghum poplar and arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ proteins is shown in supplemental figure and an alignment of the partial protein sequence and the rice poplar and arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ proteins is shown in supplemental figure . we used the blastp program to search for conserved domains in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins but we were unable to find any significant matches i.e . e values of or smaller . the tmpred program predicts that _PROTEIN_ encodes a protein with three transmembrane domains . the psort program predicts a cleavable signal sequence of amino acids . this predicted signal sequence is not included in the annotated version of _GENE_ but is in frame with an upstream met in the genomic sequence . the annotated protein includes this region which encodes a predicted signal sequence . the and the genes also have a predicted signal sequence . since all four proteins appear to have a similar structure we believe that the arabidopsis protein is misannotated . we isolated the _PROTEIN_ coding region with the exception of a single amino acid change it does not differ from the protein sequence predicted in the database . tmpred predicts that and have three transmembrane domains . _PROTEIN_ is predicted to have six transmembrane domains but is not predicted to have a cleavable signal sequence . the _PROTEIN_ coding region we isolated has a splice site change from the annotated protein sequence that removes amino acids these amino acids are not present in the rice and poplar _PROTEIN_ proteins . the presence or absence of these amino acids does not affect the prediction of the transmembrane domains . the japonica and indica proteins are also predicted to have six transmembrane domains . they also have predicted cleavable signal sequences by psort however they have approximately additional n terminal amino acids and for both proteins there is a met present after the predicted signal sequence . thus these proteins maybe misannotated . is also predicted to have six transmembrane domains however because of the uncertainty of the initiating met we can not determine whether it has a cleavable signal sequence . we have not isolated the full length coding region . proteins involved in sperm egg or sperm central cell interactions are likely to be secreted or _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ bound . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ in sperm and the proteins encoded by them are both predicted to encode _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins . to determine if _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ bound we examined their _PROTEIN_ as n terminal fusion proteins with _METHOD_ under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . the constructs were bombarded into onion epidermal peels . figure shows an onion cell _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein the _METHOD_ signal is located primarily in the margins of the cell . when these onion peels were plasmolyzed by treating with m sodium chloride according to the protocol of citation the _METHOD_ signal remained associated with the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein behaved in a similar manner figure shows the cells before salt treatment and figure e and f shows the cells after salt treatment . the _METHOD_ control was _PROTEIN_ at a higher level and was present predominantly in the cytoplasm . more _METHOD_ was seen in the cytoplasm after salt treatment in the _METHOD_ control than with either of the fusion proteins .

were collected and all zea mays rna was isolated as described . for the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ analysis of total rna was reverse transcribed using the superscript ii system according to the manufacturer 's instructions with random hexamers in a reaction . pcr was carried out using of the rt reaction in reactions primer reverse primer taq buffer and units taq polymerase using these conditions min at cycles at s at s at s at and min at except for _GENE_ for which primer annealing was done at . the primers used for pcr are as follows _GENE_ f and r _GENE_ f and r _GENE_ f and r
