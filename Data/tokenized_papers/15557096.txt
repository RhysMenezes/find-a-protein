plant cells produce different microtubule arrays that are essential for cell division and morphogenesis without equivalent in other eukaryotes . microtubule associated proteins influence the behavior of microtubules that is presumed to culminate into transitions from one array to another . we analyzed the microtubule binding properties of three arabidopsis members and in live cells using laser scanning confocal microscopy . depending on the overall organization of the cortical array _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ associated with a subset of microtubules . in cells containing both coaligned and oblique microtubules _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ tended to be associated with the coaligned microtubules . cortical microtubules labeled with _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ appeared as _PROTEIN_ bundles and showed more resistance to microtubule destabilizing drugs . the polymerization rates of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ microtubules were similar to those of tubulin _METHOD_ marked microtubules but were different from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a microtubule plus end binding like protein that stimulated polymerization . by contrast depolymerization rates of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ labeled microtubules were reduced . _METHOD_ associated with polymerizing microtubules within a bundle and with fixed microtubule termini suggesting that 's function is to bundle and stabilize adjacent microtubules of the cortex . polymerization within a bundle took place in either direction so that bundling occurred between parallel or antiparallel aligned microtubules . _METHOD_ did not label cortical microtubules or the preprophase band despite continuous _PROTEIN_ driven by the promoter and its subcellular localization was restricted to microtubules that rearranged to form a spindle and the _PROTEIN_ sides of the spindle proper . the _PROTEIN_ of peaked at mitosis in agreement with a function related to spindle formation whereas and were _PROTEIN_ throughout the cell cycle .
previously we have localized members of the protein family by _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ fusion constructs in by cells . the _METHOD_ fusion products resulted in the differential labeling of cytoskeletal structures suggesting that members of the family have distinct microtubule binding properties . to investigate the population of microtubules labeled by the _METHOD_ fusion products we imaged the _METHOD_ signal together with immunostained microtubules of by cells that produced either _METHOD_ tagged tubulin _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or the _METHOD_ fusion protein . dual _METHOD_ imaging of microtubules decorated with anti tubulin and _METHOD_ labeled microtubules revealed that _METHOD_ was associated with a subset of the cortical microtubules . the _METHOD_ protein was predominantly associated with coaligned microtubules that were usually _PROTEIN_ than other microtubules crossing the cell in different directions . transverse and obliquely oriented microtubules were labeled with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ as well as with the anti tubulin antibody . upon treatment of by cells carrying the _METHOD_ construct with the severing drug oryzalin microtubules were still clearly detected . control cells that were treated likewise lost their _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labeled microtubules almost completely . thus microtubules labeled with _METHOD_ seemed more resistant to the severing drug oryzalin than nonlabeled microtubules . next we analyzed the sensitivity of microtubules to oryzalin in life cells by time lapse microscopy . a short treatment of min removed almost all microtubules in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ by cells . the same treatment applied to cells producing _METHOD_ resulted in the incomplete depolymerization of the labeled microtubules . the remnant microtubules were more intensively labeled and appeared as _PROTEIN_ bundles . to determine the localization and to investigate the behavior of the proteins in life cells we coexpressed the _METHOD_ chimers together with monomeric red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged tubulin _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or with _METHOD_ tagged microtubule binding domain of . introduction of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ mbd in by allowed the visualization of homogeneously _METHOD_ cortical microtubules in the cell periphery . the _PROTEIN_ fusion protein tended to give more specific microtubule labeling displaying lower background _METHOD_ in the cytoplasm than did _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . by suspension cultures producing _METHOD_ mbd and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were transformed with the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ constructs . _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ strongly labeled the transversely organized cortical microtubules . the microtubule bundles appeared to be _PROTEIN_ than those observed in cells producing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ mbd alone . by cells producing _METHOD_ did not label cortical microtubules although microtubules at the _LOCATION_ periphery were labeled . recording of the green and red _METHOD_ channels separately showed that _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were bound to a subset of cortical microtubules . the abundance of microtubules not labeled with _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ varied from cell to cell and was most obvious in cells with oblique arranged microtubules . in cells with predominantly transverse arranged microtubules the overlap of both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was the highest . in these cells we also noticed that the majority of non labeled microtubules were oblique . to have an impression on the suspected preference for coaligned microtubules we counted the number of clearly oblique versus coaligned microtubules . approximately of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labeled microtubules were oblique whereas this was only for the _METHOD_ labeled microtubules . the population of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labeled microtubules that was not detected in the green _METHOD_ channel remained dark even after increasing the detector sensitivity to its maximum indicating that _METHOD_ did not label these microtubules . fully expanded and elongated cells had predominantly transverse microtubules and showed strong colocalization of _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ whereas rounded cells often had oblique microtubules with much less overlap . thus microtubule association of and shows preference for coaligned microtubules . some of the _METHOD_ microtubules appeared to be resistant to degradation by the microtubule drug oryzalin . to analyze the drug sensitivity of microtubules labeled with _METHOD_ in live cells by cultures that coexpressed _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were treated with amiprophos methyl and propyzamide . amiprophos methyl is a phosphoroamidate with an action similar to that of the closely related oryzalin a dinitroaniline that binds to plant tubulin and affects protofilament interactions . propyzamide on the other hand is a benzamide that may have a more subtle effect on microtubule polymerization as transversely organized microtubules are better protected against its action . in the presence of amiprophos methyl or propyzamide cortical microtubules of control cells producing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ decayed within min . by contrast some microtubules in cells producing _METHOD_ remained despite the microtubule drugs . degradation was apparent in amiprophos methyl treated cells resulting in the accumulation of _METHOD_ dots . propyzamide caused a weaker effect with most of the microtubules labeled with _METHOD_ still intact after h although the _METHOD_ intensity was reduced . thus _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ stabilizes and increases drug resistance of microtubules . upon viewing a number of video recordings of the cortical array from _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ cells we noticed that the frequency at which newly formed microtubules coming into the scanned field was lower than that observed in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ mbd cells . to have an impression on the dynamics of the cortical array we measured the abundance of microtubule bundles accumulated in a time frame of min by counting the number of _METHOD_ tracks that crossed a bar placed perpendicular to the long axis of a fully expanded cell . in recordings an average of _METHOD_ mbd labeled microtubules crossed the bar . the number of microtubules counted in _METHOD_ labeled cells was significantly lower in _METHOD_ and in cells producing _METHOD_ . an average of microtubules crossed a bar in cells producing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ stimulated microtubule polymerization dynamics . a more detailed observation of the _METHOD_ tracks in the time lapse recordings from _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ by cells revealed changes in _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the labeled microtubule bundles consistent with growth and shrinkage of microtubules alongside the bundle . we digitally linearized a number of _METHOD_ tracks and plotted these against time in separate kymographs . the kymograph shown in figure illustrates a _METHOD_ track with relatively simple polymerization and depolymerization dynamics of an individual microtubule that lies within an existing microtubule bundle . polymerization and depolymerization occurred in the two directions within the same microtubule bundle . the kymograph in figure identifies a position on the microtubule that appears to be a nucleation site from which two microtubules polymerize in opposing directions . many of the track histories were difficult to interpret because of a relatively high background _METHOD_ of the microtubule bundle and because each track carried the life history of multiple microtubules . these data indicate high dynamicity of adjacent microtubules within a microtubule bundle . as there were relatively few new _METHOD_ tracks appearing in our recordings it is possible that most _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ labeled microtubules initiated at positions near or on the cortical microtubules . microtubule initiation sites occur in association with existing microtubules but can also be independent from microtubules . microtubule nucleation independent from existing microtubules was not found in by cells producing _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ probably because such sites do not involve polymerization of bundled microtubules . microtubules labeled with _METHOD_ often carried hot spots of _METHOD_ that appeared as dots along a weakly fluorescing track . occasionally dots were also seen in cells producing _METHOD_ but these occurred less frequently . the abundance of the _METHOD_ spots varied from cell to cell and they were mostly within or adjacent to microtubule bundles although some were also apparently not connected to labeled microtubules . in time lapse recordings that we screened for _METHOD_ spots none of them was mobile during the course of monitoring indicating that they were different from the rapidly moving microtubule plus ends or the slow moving minus ends . the absence from dynamic microtubule plus ends was further confirmed in transiently transfected tobacco epidermal cells carrying combinations of the _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion constructs . the _METHOD_ spots that were observed in this experimental setup were not labeled with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and we did not observe microtubule initiation emanating from the spots so they must be different from the nucleation sites described before . some spots appeared to localize to the end of a microtubule . the _METHOD_ spots also marked microtubule ends that occurred within a bundle . in several occasions we observed that microtubules polymerizing within a bundle paused at the position of a strongly _METHOD_ spot and subsequently started to depolymerize . analysis of the _METHOD_ intensity plots of the microtubule tracks further revealed that _METHOD_ label varied along with the red _METHOD_ mbd label over a distance within the same microtubule bundle . figure illustrates the intensity in _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ mbd _METHOD_ within the same track recorded over a time period of min . the _METHOD_ and the _METHOD_ mbd signals showed two consecutive reductions in intensity albeit it was more pronounced for _METHOD_ . the shifts in _METHOD_ coincided with the positions where a microtubule joined the bundle as if it was dependent on the density or number of microtubules within the bundle . the increase in green signal from _METHOD_ _METHOD_ corresponded to the relative amplitude of the red signal from _METHOD_ mbd indicating that they were interrelated . in _PROTEIN_ the trace with the weakest _METHOD_ signal might correspond to a single microtubule that on its own does not suffice for _METHOD_ binding . the data suggest that _METHOD_ associates with adjacent microtubules and concentrates at stable microtubule ends . the increases and _PROTEIN_ in length of _METHOD_ tracks occurring in interphase cells over a time period of min were taken as a measure for the rate of polymerization and depolymerization respectively . data were collected from microtubules labeled with _METHOD_ mbd _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ in by cells that were cultivated and observed under similar experimental conditions . the microtubule shown in figure displayed a polymerization speed of and in the first and the second events respectively . the shrinkage rate of the same microtubule in figure was and . these latter values are about one half of that measured for control markers suggesting that _METHOD_ labeled microtubules had a reduced depolymerization speed . the catastrophe and rescue events of microtubules growing and shrinking along existing bundles were difficult to measure because of the high background _METHOD_ from neighboring fibers and because of the complexity of the variations in _METHOD_ intensity . we therefore determined the dynamicity parameters more accurately from newly appearing microtubule tracks that were not visibly in contact to other microtubules . polymerization and depolymerization speeds were determined from at least three individual tracks per cell . these values were averaged for n cells and used to calculate the average speeds . figure shows the frequency at which a given average speed was recorded per cell . from table i it can be inferred that _METHOD_ mbd microtubules grow at an average speed of and shrink at . application of _PROTEIN_ statistics and sheffy analysis on the raw data set classified _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ polymerization rates together with the result from _METHOD_ mbd . depolymerization rate on the other hand was found to be significantly different . thus the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ depolymerization rate was reduced for microtubules that had newly appeared as well as for those embedded in preexisting bundles . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labeled microtubules polymerized at an average speed of . this is significantly faster than tubulin _METHOD_ labeled microtubules . the stimulatory effect on polymerization was specific to _PROTEIN_ as _PROTEIN_ did not display increased growth rates . depolymerization rates and transition frequencies could not be analyzed for microtubules labeled with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ because these proteins were removed from the microtubule plus end upon catastrophy . catastrophy and rescue of microtubules labeled with _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were calculated from the inverse of the mean time spent in shrinkage and the mean time in growth respectively . a significant reduction in rescue frequency was evident for microtubules labeled with _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ compared to _METHOD_ mbd labeled microtubules . together these data indicate that cortical microtubules show distinct dynamic behavior depending on whether they are labeled with _METHOD_ mbd or _PROTEIN_ . microtubule instability parameters the presence of a conserved destruction box in several of the family members is indicative of the regulation of protein abundance throughout the course of the cell cycle . the tobacco cyclin _PROTEIN_ protein for example has been shown to carry a functional destruction box xn that is essential for its degradation at the onset of anaphase by the proteasome complex . we found a conserved d box in the n terminus of the sequence . in addition to posttranslational control b type cyclins are also regulated at the transcriptional level . we therefore decided to analyze the rna profiles of the transcripts using publicly available affymetrix microarray data of synchronized arabidopsis tissue culture cells . figure shows the _PROTEIN_ profiles that were retrieved for and _PROTEIN_ . was coactivated with _PROTEIN_ at the onset of mitosis h after release from the aphidicolin block . showed a moderate increase in _PROTEIN_ peaking at mitosis . by contrast _PROTEIN_ was reduced from s phase through m phase . it contains a conserved d box sequence at a similar position as . _PROTEIN_ of is therefore most likely regulated at the transcriptional and posttranslational level . cortical array microtubules are not decorated by _METHOD_ despite continuous _PROTEIN_ driven by the promoter and production of the _METHOD_ protein . however a distinct _METHOD_ pattern developed during early events of the preprophase . at that time of the cell division program the preprophase band is still present and appears as a narrow band at either side of the _LOCATION_ in optical confocal sections . the preprophase band contains microtubules labeled with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and was slightly labeled with _METHOD_ . much stronger _METHOD_ _METHOD_ labeling occurred at the perinuclear array where _LOCATION_ microtubules start to assemble into a bipolar spindle structure . the _METHOD_ protein was unevenly distributed at the periphery of the _LOCATION_ very early at the beginning of microtubule organization when the _LOCATION_ envelope is intact and the remains of the degrading _PROTEIN_ are still visible . the two poles of the plant spindle are not focused into a single point like in yeast or metazoan cells but wider and more loosely arranged . _METHOD_ was associated with the spindle microtubules and preferentially localized to the spindle poles . the concentration at the poles became more evident as the metaphase progressed into anaphase and chromosomes separated . _METHOD_ was not associated with spindle microtubules that connect the two poles . at the end of anaphase _METHOD_ dissociated from the spindle and either disappeared into the cytoplasm or was proteolytically removed . thus the primary function of function is restricted to mitosis and more specifically to spindle formation .
_PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were cloned into the _PROTEIN_ entry vector . the open reading frames of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the mdb of were amplified by pcr and cloned into . for amplification of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the same set of primers was used . primers were compatible with the _PROTEIN_ vector and no _PROTEIN_ sequences were included _PROTEIN_ fwd _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ttagtattcctctccttcatcatcc mbd fwd tcccggcaagaagaagcaaagg mbd _PROTEIN_ ttaacctcctgcaggaaagtggcca . promoter driven _METHOD_ fusion constructs were generated in the destination vector for c terminal fusions and for n terminal fusions via lr reactions _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ fusion constructs were made similarly except that in the destination vector _METHOD_ was substituted with _METHOD_ . stable by transformation was carried out as described . tobacco leaf epidermal cells were transfected as described . _METHOD_ microscopy was done with a confocal microscope with software package lsm version equipped with a water corrected objective to scan the cell cortex and the middle of dividing by cells . dual _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was imaged in a multichannel setting with nm and nm light for _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ excitation respectively . emission _METHOD_ was captured in the frame scanning mode alternating _METHOD_ _METHOD_ via a to nm bandpass emission filter and _METHOD_ via a nm cutoff filter . images were recorded at to digital zoom . four days after subculture _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ by cells were fixed and processed for immunolabeling with anti tubulin monoclonal antibodies according to the procedure described in citation . for live cell recordings samples were applied to a chambered cover glass and immobilized in a thin layer of of by medium containing vitamins and of low melting point agar . selected cells were imaged before the addition of oryzalin amiprophos methyl or propyzamide _PROTEIN_ . drugs were added in a volume of of by medium with added vitamins and the drug at a concentration adjusted to a final volume of . stock solutions of apm and propyzamide were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide . as control and dimethylsulfoxide dilutions in by medium were used . microtubule behavior was monitored in consecutive image stacks taken min and h after drug application . the cell cortex was monitored over the course of min and imaged every s . the number of _METHOD_ tracks in these time lapse recordings _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ that crossed a straight line placed perpendicular to the _PROTEIN_ axis of the transversely oriented microtubules was counted . _METHOD_ intensity of microtubule tracks was measured on single optical sections or flattened z stack images averaged for _METHOD_ intensity using the imagej software program . data points were collected from individual microtubule tracks and resliced against time as kymographs . _METHOD_ intensity variations in microtubule bundles were plotted as the respective gray value of the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ against the position within a track . cells preincubated for h in chambered cover glass wells were recorded in solidified by medium containing low melting point agar at room temperature . images were taken every s during the course of min . growth and shrinkage velocities were calculated by dividing the distance covered by the time spent for growth or shortening . polymerization rates were averaged from at least three individual measurements per cell . a minimum of and a maximum of events were analyzed from up to different cells . _PROTEIN_ and scheffe statistical tests indicated that the average polymerization rates calculated for microtubules labeled with _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ mbd fell into a single category and that they were significantly distinct from that of the _PROTEIN_ labeled microtubules . depolymerization rates were calculated from a minimum of and maximum of individual events . _PROTEIN_ and scheffe tests indicated that the average depolymerization rates of microtubules labeled with _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were statistically distinct from those labeled with _METHOD_ mbd . frequency of catastrophy and rescue were calculated as the inverse of the mean time spent in depolymerization and in polymerization respectively .
