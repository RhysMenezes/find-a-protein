endomembrane proteins belonging to the evolutionarily conserved transmembrane nine superfamily in yeast and mammalian cells are characterized by the presence of a large lumenal n terminus nine transmembrane domains and a short cytoplasmic tail . the arabidopsis thaliana genome contains emp members _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but little is known about their protein subcellular localization and function . here we studied the subcellular localization and targeting mechanism of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis and demonstrated that both endogenous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion localized to the _LOCATION_ apparatus in transgenic arabidopsis plants _METHOD_ fusion at the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ caused mislocalization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to reach post _LOCATION_ compartments and _LOCATION_ for degradation in arabidopsis cells the _PROTEIN_ cytoplasmic tail contained dual sorting signals _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the _LOCATION_ retention motif of _PROTEIN_ retained several post _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins within the _LOCATION_ apparatus in gain of function analysis . these sorting signals are highly conserved in all plant emp _METHOD_ and thus likely represent a general mechanism for emp targeting in plant cells .
all _METHOD_ of arabidopsis emp proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ share high similarity at the amino acid level and in predicted topology . all at emps are predicted to have a large lumenal n terminal domain followed by nine tmds and a short ct . eleven at emp members _PROTEIN_ are predicted to have a signal peptide in their n terminus . as a first step to understanding the biology of emps in plants we analyzed the subcellular localization and trafficking route of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . we first used a _METHOD_ fusion approach by making a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct in which a sp _METHOD_ was used to replace the sp of _PROTEIN_ . to test if this new fusion _PROTEIN_ the identical topology as _PROTEIN_ we performed a protease protection assay using microsomes isolated from arabidopsis cells _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion followed by immunoblot analysis using _METHOD_ antibody . the n terminus of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was found to be resistant to protease digestion because the kd _METHOD_ fragment remained intact in the presence of trypsin whereas the kd full length _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion did not indicating the lumenal location of the _METHOD_ tag as predicted . the reliability of such a protease protection assay was further verified by an identical experiment using a _METHOD_ fusion of the type i integral _LOCATION_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ as a control in which the lumenal _METHOD_ remained intact upon protease digestion . to study the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ we next generated _PROTEIN_ antibodies and transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ for immunoblot analysis . as shown in figure _METHOD_ antibody detected a single protein band around kd likely representing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the cell _LOCATION_ fraction but not the cell soluble fraction of the transgenic arabidopsis seedlings _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ whereas no such protein band was detected in wild type plants . by contrast anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies detected the putative kd endogenous emp protein band in the cm fraction of both wild type and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants as well as the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion . a subcellular fractionation study using a continuous sucrose gradient and wild type arabidopsis cells showed that anti _PROTEIN_ had an identical distribution pattern as the cis _LOCATION_ marker anti _PROTEIN_ thus indicating a possible _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ . to further prove this confocal _METHOD_ labeling was next performed in root cells of transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . as shown in figure the punctate _METHOD_ signals of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were fully colocalized with anti _PROTEIN_ . in addition anti _PROTEIN_ was found to fully colocalize with the cis _LOCATION_ marker yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ but was largely separated from the pvc marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in these transgenic arabidopsis root cells indicating that both endogenous _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion are localized to the _LOCATION_ apparatus in arabidopsis cells . thus _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ can be used to study the subcellular localization and trafficking of _PROTEIN_ in plant cells . to further confirm the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ proteins from the above confocal _METHOD_ study we next performed immunogold electron microscopy using either _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ antibodies on ultrathin sections prepared from high pressure frozen/freeze substituted root tips of wild type or transgenic _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis plants . as shown in figure in wild type arabidopsis root cells anti _PROTEIN_ labeled the _LOCATION_ apparatus in which the majority of the gold particles were found in the cis and medial _LOCATION_ . similar patterns of _LOCATION_ localization were also obtained in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transformed arabidopsis root cells using anti _METHOD_ antibodies . in addition _LOCATION_ labeling with _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ antibodies was specific as little labeling was seen in other organelles including tgn mvb and mitochondria in these experiments . taken together these confocal _METHOD_ and immunogold em studies demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localized to the _LOCATION_ apparatus with preferential localization to the cis and medial _LOCATION_ in arabidopsis cells . we next wanted to test if the established transient _PROTEIN_ system of arabidopsis protoplasts could be used to study the trafficking of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . consistent with the above _METHOD_ and immunogold em studies in transgenic arabidopsis root cells _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was found to be fully colocalized with the cis _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ when they were transiently coexpressed together in arabidopsis protoplasts . by contrast _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was largely separated from the tgn marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and the pvc marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts . in addition when the _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ traffic was blocked by overexpression of a _PROTEIN_ specific guanosine nucleotide exchange _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ vesicle formation both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were trapped and colocalized within the _LOCATION_ indicating that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ reached the _LOCATION_ via the _PROTEIN_ dependent _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ sorting route a result consistent with the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . since _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is fully colocalized with the endogenous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ apparatus in arabidopsis cells or with the _LOCATION_ marker in arabidopsis protoplasts we thus used arabidopsis protoplasts to study the targeting of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . since little is known about the _LOCATION_ targeting of emps with nine tmds we first tested whether the large lumenal n terminus or the short _LOCATION_ c terminus are essential for _LOCATION_ localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ by generating two truncated constructs _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in which either the lumenal n terminus or the _LOCATION_ ct was deleted respectively . as shown in supplemental figure online upon transient _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ remained in the _LOCATION_ as it colocalized with the _LOCATION_ marker indicating that the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ was not essential for its _LOCATION_ localization . by contrast ct deletion resulted in _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ because _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fully colocalized with the _LOCATION_ marker calnexin _METHOD_ upon their coexpression indicating the possible existence of an _LOCATION_ export signal at the ct of _PROTEIN_ . so far various _LOCATION_ export signals have been identified at the cytoplasmic part of integral _LOCATION_ proteins . best known examples are the diacidic motif dxe within the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein _LOCATION_ tail the dihydrophobic motifs _PROTEIN_ found in the family proteins and the tyro based signals identified in the tail sequence of _LOCATION_ family proteins . alignment analysis of cts of arabidopsis emps indicates the existence of a putative dihydrophobic motif and a tyr residue in all at emps . to find out if the putative dihydrophobic motif and tyr residue in the _PROTEIN_ ct are important for the _LOCATION_ export of _PROTEIN_ we performed mutagenesis analysis on the dihydrophobic or tyr motifs of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ ct . mutations of dihydrophobic combined with tyr motifs totally block the _LOCATION_ export of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ which was fully colocalized with the _LOCATION_ marker calnexin _METHOD_ . interestingly the solo tyr mutation only partially inhibited the _LOCATION_ export of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . however the combined mutations of tyr with one hydrophobic amino acid phe or val effectively blocked the _LOCATION_ export of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ indicating that the dihydrophobic residue synergistically combined with tyr to drive the _LOCATION_ export of _PROTEIN_ . this conclusion was further confirmed by double mutation of the dihydrophobic motif phe and val that only partially blocked the _LOCATION_ export of _PROTEIN_ as they colocalized with both _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ markers however single mutation on one hydrophobic amino acid phe or val had no effect on the _LOCATION_ export of _PROTEIN_ . mutations of other amino acids besides the dihydrophobic or tyr residues did not affect the _LOCATION_ export of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . taken together these results support the conclusion that both the hydrophobic motif and tyr residue in the _LOCATION_ tail play essential roles in the _LOCATION_ export of _PROTEIN_ . transmembrane cargos usually possess a binding affinity with _PROTEIN_ prebudding complexes through their _LOCATION_ export signals in order to be included in _PROTEIN_ vesicles for _LOCATION_ export . we next wanted to find out if _PROTEIN_ subunits interact with the _LOCATION_ export motifs in the _PROTEIN_ ct using in vitro peptide binding experiments . the soluble fractions isolated from arabidopsis protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were used as a source of _PROTEIN_ subunits for binding with columns conjugated with synthetic peptides of _PROTEIN_ ct or its mutation on the dihydrophobic/tyr residues . as shown in figure the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was retained in the column with the _PROTEIN_ ct peptides but such binding was dramatically reduced in the mutated column indicating that the dihydrophobic /tyr residues of _PROTEIN_ ct preferably bound to the _PROTEIN_ subunit . interestingly when _METHOD_ was fused at the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ the resulting _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was found to localize to both the _LOCATION_ and punctate structures distinct from the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ but partially colocalized with the tgn marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and the pvc marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts indicating that _METHOD_ fusion at the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ caused it to move from the _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ via tgn/pvc . in addition _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ also passed through the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ sorting route via the _PROTEIN_ vesicle en route to the _LOCATION_ because overexpression of trapped it within the _LOCATION_ indicating that the c terminal _METHOD_ fusion did not affect the _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ transport but caused mislocalization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to post _LOCATION_ compartments including tgn pvc and the _LOCATION_ . to further find out if the _PROTEIN_ ct is essential for its _LOCATION_ retention we used a gain of function approach and added an additional _PROTEIN_ ct sequence to the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . indeed the resulting _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ct was found to remain in the _LOCATION_ as it colocalized with the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ but largely separated from the tgn and pvc markers upon their transient coexpression in arabidopsis protoplasts . further mutagenesis analysis of the _PROTEIN_ ct demonstrated that the last six amino acids rnikcd _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or even the last three residues kcd _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were sufficient to retain the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ within the _LOCATION_ or efficiently retrieve _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ back to the _LOCATION_ apparatus . interestingly sequence alignment analysis of the cts of emp homologs from arabidopsis rice and maize showed the presence of a highly conserved lys in the position and an acidic residue in the position . to test if this conserved lys based motif kxd/e was essential for _LOCATION_ retention we performed point mutation analysis on this motif via substitution with ala residues . double point mutations on lys and asp _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or single mutation on lys _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or asp _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ all resulted in mislocalization of these _METHOD_ fusions to _LOCATION_ and post _LOCATION_ pvc organelles that were largely distinct from the _LOCATION_ apparatus . thus it _METHOD_ that both k and d/e in the kxd/e motif are essential for _LOCATION_ localization or retention of _PROTEIN_ . in addition the kxd/e motif must be presented at the c terminal end to function as a _LOCATION_ retention signal as the addition of three ala residues at the c terminus of the _LOCATION_ localized _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ rnikcd caused its mislocalization to the _LOCATION_ and pvc . the pvc mediated degradation of these mislocalized _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions was further proved by coexpression with a constitutively active mutant _PROTEIN_ which can induce pvc enlargement and trap the degradative cargo proteins within its lumen . indeed both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ rnikcdaaa occurred as large round dots within the lumen of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labeled _PROTEIN_ like structures distinct from the punctate patterns of _LOCATION_ localized _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ rnikcd . the detection of _METHOD_ signals in the _LOCATION_ in cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tagged transmembrane proteins usually indicates the occurrence of protein degradation . to provide further evidence that these various _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ rnikcd mutation fusions were degraded in _LOCATION_ upon their _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts we performed immunoblot analysis using _METHOD_ antibodies . as shown in figure upon _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts the _LOCATION_ localized _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ rnikcd largely remained as the full length protein in the cm fraction while < of the signal was detected as the _METHOD_ core in the cs fraction . by contrast in cells _PROTEIN_ the three other constructs with a mutation on the kxd/e motif _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or c terminal addition > of the detected signals were found as the _METHOD_ core in the cs fraction indicating that their turnover rate is much higher than that of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ rnikcd . quantification analysis of these _METHOD_ signals in the cm versus cs fractions of individual proteins further confirmed this conclusion . thus both confocal data and immunoblot analysis point to the same conclusion that the c terminal kxd/e motif functions as a _LOCATION_ retention signal for _PROTEIN_ . to further explore the molecular mechanism of kxd/e motif function in _LOCATION_ retention we next used the synthetic peptides corresponding to the _PROTEIN_ ct as bait to isolate possible interacting proteins from wild type arabidopsis proteins in pull down experiments followed by protein elution separation via _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis for protein identification . in duplicate experiments several proteins that were specifically pulled out by the _PROTEIN_ ct peptide column were identified as the _PROTEIN_ coat subunits . the _PROTEIN_ vesicles are the predominant means by which the _LOCATION_ proteins recycle back to the _LOCATION_ or are retained in the _LOCATION_ . we thus further tested whether _PROTEIN_ coatomers could bind with the kxd/e motif using in vitro peptide binding experiments as described previously . the soluble fraction isolated from arabidopsis protoplasts _PROTEIN_ myc an arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ protein was used as a source of _PROTEIN_ coat protein in the binding experiment using the synthetic peptide of _PROTEIN_ ct or its mutants of the kxd/e motif as binding baits . as shown in figure myc specifically binds to the _PROTEIN_ ct as detected by anti myc antibody but such binding was completely abolished when the kxd motif in the ct was mutated to either aca or _PROTEIN_ while the binding ability was reduced significantly for the kca peptide indicating that the lys in the kxd motif played a more critical role in _PROTEIN_ binding . these binding results are consistent with those obtained with confocal subcellular localization and immunoblot analysis of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ rnikca . therefore binding with the _PROTEIN_ coatomer was a means by which the kxd/e motif achieved the _LOCATION_ retention function . to find out if the _LOCATION_ retention signal rnikcd identified in the _PROTEIN_ ct would have a similar function in other _LOCATION_ proteins we next used a gain of function approach by adding this motif to the c terminus of _METHOD_ fusions of two selective post _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ fusions with the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ an integral _LOCATION_ protein with four tmds were localized to both the tgn and pm via an _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ tgn pm pathway . indeed the original tgn/pm localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was altered by the addition of the rnikcd motif to the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ because _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ rnikcd was largely colocalized with the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in arabidopsis protoplasts . a similar result was obtained when the rnikcd motif was fused to the c terminus of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ because the resulting _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ rnikcd fusion was also found to be trapped in the _LOCATION_ colocalizing with the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ indicating that the rnikcd motif showed similar _LOCATION_ retention function even without direct fusion with _METHOD_ . the arabidopsis two pore potassium channel _PROTEIN_ protein is a tonoplast localized potassium channel with four tmds and a cytoplasmic n terminus and c terminus . as expected _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed a typical tonoplast localization pattern that was distinct from the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in arabidopsis protoplasts . however when rnikcd was added to its c terminus the resulting _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ rnikcd was found to localize to both _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and tonoplast indicating that rnikcd partially trapped the tonoplast localized _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ within the _LOCATION_ . such dual localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ rnikcd in the _LOCATION_ and tonoplast may be caused by the competition between the kxd/e _LOCATION_ retention signal and the tonoplast targeting signals found in _PROTEIN_ . thus it will be interesting to investigate the combinational effect of these distinct targeting signals in determining targeting of these proteins . taken together the c terminal addition of rnikcd caused _LOCATION_ retention of two post _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which were originally localized in the tgn/pm and tonoplast respectively . in addition since most of these targeting studies were performed using the arabidopsis protoplast transient _PROTEIN_ system it will be of interest to generate transgenic tobacco bright yellow or arabidopsis cell lines and transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ some of the key fusion constructs _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ for use in future studies .
