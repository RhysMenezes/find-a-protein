in plants very long chain fatty acids _PROTEIN_ are precursors of sphingolipids triacylglycerols cuticular waxes and suberin . vlcfas are synthesized by a multiprotein _LOCATION_ bound fatty acid elongation system that catalyzes four successive enzymatic reactions condensation reduction dehydration and a second reduction . a bioinformatics survey of the arabidopsis genome has revealed two sequences homologous to _PROTEIN_ encoding a saccharomyces cerevisiae ketoacyl reductase which catalyzes the first reduction during vlcfa elongation . _PROTEIN_ analyses showed that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes were transcribed in siliques flowers inflorescence _METHOD_ leaves as well as developing embryos but only _PROTEIN_ transcript was detected in roots . _METHOD_ protein tagged _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ the site of fatty acid elongation . complementation of the yeast _PROTEIN_ mutant demonstrated that the two kcr proteins are divergent and that only _PROTEIN_ can restore heterologous elongase activity similar to the native yeast kcr gene . analyses of insertional mutants in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ revealed that loss of _PROTEIN_ function results in embryo lethality which can not be rescued by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ using the _PROTEIN_ promoter . in contrast a disruption of the _PROTEIN_ gene had no obvious phenotypic effect . taken together these results indicate that only _PROTEIN_ is a functional kcr isoform involved in microsomal fatty acid elongation . to investigate the roles of _PROTEIN_ in postembryonic development transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ rna interference and overexpression constructs targeted against _PROTEIN_ were generated . morphological and biochemical characterization of these lines confirmed that suppressed kcr activity results in a reduction of cuticular wax load and affects vlcfa composition of sphingolipids seed triacylglycerols and root glycerolipids demonstrating in planta that kcr is involved in elongation reactions supplying vlcfa for all these diverse classes of lipids .
the isolation of the yeast kcr gene _PROTEIN_ resulted in the identification of a single arabidopsis ortholog _GENE_ which we refer to as _PROTEIN_ . further exploration of the arabidopsis genome revealed another kcr like sequence _GENE_ which we designate _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ has a bp open reading frame that encodes a protein of amino acids with a predicted molecular _METHOD_ of kd . _PROTEIN_ has a bp orf that encodes a protein of amino acids with a predicted molecular _METHOD_ of kd . both these proteins have a putative nadh binding site and contain highly conserved ser tyr lys residues essential for catalysis though a dilysine motif required for _LOCATION_ retention is obvious only in _PROTEIN_ . unlike the maize orthologs and that are identical and have partially redundant biochemical functions _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ exhibit only amino acid identity suggesting that they could play diverse roles in vlcfa production in arabidopsis . percentage of amino acid sequence identity between different kcr proteins to investigate the in planta function of the two predicted atkcr enzymes we initiated a reverse genetic approach by identifying insertional mutants disrupted in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes . a single line g obtained from plant functional genomics research group of _PROTEIN_ genomic sciences center was found to carry a ds transposon in the second intron of the _PROTEIN_ gene . the exact site of insertion was determined by sequencing the pcr product generated using a combination of gene and ds transposon specific primers . surprisingly no homozygous _PROTEIN_ plants were identified by pcr genotyping of the progeny of the self fertilized insertion line and the segregation of wild type to heterozygous plants was approximately suggesting that homozygous _PROTEIN_ loss of function mutation may be embryo lethal . to test this hypothesis we dissected the siliques developing on heterozygous _PROTEIN_ plants and compared them with the siliques from the wild type plants . siliques from the wild type contained uniformly green developing seeds whereas siliques from the self fertilized _PROTEIN_ heterozygotes contained approximately of aborted seeds . initially aborted seeds appeared white or transparent in color at a stage when wild type appearing siblings were green . _PROTEIN_ on the aborted seeds were dark brown shrunken and deformed . attempts to confirm by pcr amplification that these aborted seeds were indeed homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutants failed . however reverse transcription pcr analysis using _PROTEIN_ specific primers showed reduced _PROTEIN_ transcript levels in _PROTEIN_ and no detectable transcript in the presumed homozygous white seeds . seeds from siliques developing on heterozygous plants were further analyzed by differential interference contrast microscopy to compare the progression of embryogenesis in these two seed types . in young siliques all the seeds were white and contained embryos at the globular stage . however in older siliques only wild type appearing green seeds continued to develop normally with embryos proceeding from globular stage to maturation over the course of d after flowering . in contrast embryos from white seeds arrested at the globular stage . we also obtained two t dna insertion lines in the _PROTEIN_ gene and sail with t dna insertions in the second and fourth exons respectively . no visible developmental phenotypes were observed in homozygous _PROTEIN_ progenies from either t dna mutant line . to determine if the two apparent arabidopsis homologs are both constitutively _PROTEIN_ and to delineate their _PROTEIN_ domains we performed rt pcr analyses and _PROTEIN_ assays in transgenic plants transformed with _PROTEIN_ gus and _PROTEIN_ gus constructs . as shown in figure both genes are _PROTEIN_ in green siliques flowers inflorescence _METHOD_ and leaves with the highest _PROTEIN_ levels detected in siliques and flowers . high _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were also present in roots whereas _PROTEIN_ transcript was almost undetectable in root tissues . these _PROTEIN_ results were confirmed by gus activity assays . in addition _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ directed gus activity was also detected in embryos of different stages and young developing seedlings but was absent from mature seeds and stem bases . to compare the subcellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion constructs were initially transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco under the control of the promoter . visualization of tobacco leaves revealed that both proteins were localized in the _LOCATION_ . we also introduced both _METHOD_ protein fusion constructs into arabidopsis . to ensure that the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is fully functional we _PROTEIN_ it in _PROTEIN_ heterozygous plants . sixteen out of recovered independent transgenic lines had siliques with only green wild type looking seeds and no white seeds indicating complementation and demonstrating that the mutation in the _PROTEIN_ gene is responsible for the embryo lethality . in all the complemented _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines examined by confocal microscopy _METHOD_ _METHOD_ labeled a reticulate network typical of the _LOCATION_ . because the disruption of _PROTEIN_ did not result in a detectable phenotype we could not verify if the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein is active by complementation of a loss of function mutant but we decided to proceed with its localization . for this purpose we transformed the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion construct into wild type arabidopsis . this experiment revealed that the _PROTEIN_ protein also resides in the _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ has been previously shown to restore heterologous elongase activity of the yeast _PROTEIN_ mutant similar to the _PROTEIN_ of native yeast kcr gene _PROTEIN_ indicating that the arabidopsis and yeast enzymes are functionally equivalent and that _PROTEIN_ also likely catalyzes the reduction of the ketoacyl coa . this result was confirmed in this study . by contrast the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ failed to restore heterologous fatty acid elongation mediated by either _PROTEIN_ or the isochrysis galbana elo like elongating activity in the _PROTEIN_ yeast mutant and also failed to rescue the slow growth phenotype of _PROTEIN_ yeast cells associated with impaired endogenous elongase function suggesting that _PROTEIN_ has no kcr activity in yeast . the _PROTEIN_ that _PROTEIN_ loss of function mutation is embryo lethal suggests that either _PROTEIN_ is not a functional kcr or that _PROTEIN_ is not _PROTEIN_ during embryogenesis . gus activity assays in transgenic plants transformed with the _PROTEIN_ gus construct and global gene _PROTEIN_ analyses during arabidopsis embryogenesis indicate that _PROTEIN_ is transcribed at all times during embryo development albeit at a much lower level than _PROTEIN_ . to determine if the low _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ was the reason why _PROTEIN_ could not support embryogenesis in the absence of _PROTEIN_ or whether the _PROTEIN_ was indeed inactive we _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ using the _PROTEIN_ promoter in the _PROTEIN_ background . in contrast to _PROTEIN_ which complemented the _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ could not rescue the embryo lethality of _PROTEIN_ even when _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ manner behind the _PROTEIN_ promoter confirming that it is not a functional kcr isoform . embryo lethality prevented further phenotypic analysis on homozygous _PROTEIN_ lines and no developmental differences or changes in seed vlcfa composition or cuticular wax accumulation were detected in _PROTEIN_ heterozygotes in comparison with wild type plants . we therefore generated transgenic plants in which _PROTEIN_ was down regulated by rnai to characterize their morphological and biochemical phenotypes and determine the role of _PROTEIN_ in the different vlcfa metabolic pathways . to test the specificity of our rnai construct and ensure that the phenotypes that we describe are due to suppression of _PROTEIN_ alone we performed rt pcr analysis of the rnai suppressed plants using mrna prepared from flowers that showed high _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the wild type in previous assays . this experiment confirmed that the rnai construct specifically down regulates the _PROTEIN_ of only _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ . twenty rnai transformants were chosen for further evaluation . these plants displayed a variety of phenotypes including growth retardation and fused rosette leaves . individuals with the most severe morphological phenotype never formed rosettes but instead produced incompletely developed leaf like structures . they were also highly sensitive to dehydration and needed to be cultivated in a controlled environment with atmospheric humidity above in wet soil at all times . eleven plants failed to grow to maturity developed necrotic spots and died . from the nine remaining plants three required mechanical organ separations to allow distorted leaves and inflorescence _METHOD_ to develop . soil grown progeny of these atkcr rnai primary transformants exhibited two predominant phenotypes glossy inflorescence _METHOD_ or twisted and curled fiddlehead like _METHOD_ that were not obviously glossy . both glossy and nonglossy plants were present in the progeny of the and lines . these three lines together with a fourth line were selected for a detailed morphological and biochemical characterization . examination of the flowers from glossy plants revealed an unusual bushy stigma morphology with longer papillae and stamen with shorter filaments unable to position anthers at the height of the stigma similar to that reported for _PROTEIN_ . these plants also produced short and crooked siliques containing mostly aborted seeds suggesting a problem with pollen viability/fertility . cross pollination of glossy plants with wild type pollen resulted in longer siliques and a considerably increased number of seeds produced . similar short and crooked siliques were also found on the nonglossy plants . interestingly mature dried seeds collected from both glossy and nonglossy atkcr rnai plants were considerably larger than seeds collected from wild type plants grown under identical conditions . dry weight of seeds collected from glossy and nonglossy atkcr rnai plants compared to the wild type each value is the mean of three independent measurements sd . gl glossy ngl nonglossy . an aspect of the atkcr rnai phenotype that has not previously been reported in other mutants impaired in vlcfa biosynthesis is the abnormal root morphology of the glossy plants . when grown horizontally on plates the roots of these plants ran on the surface of the gel _PROTEIN_ lacked _PROTEIN_ branches and had dramatically reduced root hairs . closer observation revealed that _PROTEIN_ root primordia were formed but did not elongate . in contrast roots of nonglossy plants with curly inflorescences appeared wild type . to determine if the phenotypes observed were due to _PROTEIN_ rnai suppression _PROTEIN_ transcript levels in transgenic lines were determined by rt pcr in d old seedlings and in a number of tissues from week old plants . as shown in figure in the developing seedlings and in all of the tissues analyzed the levels of _PROTEIN_ transcripts were lower than in the wild type . the reduction in kcr transcripts was more pronounced in the glossy plants compared with the more limited reduction observed in the nonglossy lines . within each line and for each plant phenotype levels of _PROTEIN_ transcripts were similar in all tissues . these results show a clear correlation between reduced levels of _PROTEIN_ transcripts and increased severity of the phenotype in the generation . we also overexpressed the _PROTEIN_ cdna under the control of promoter . about of transgenic lines displayed abnormal phenotypes similar to those of the _PROTEIN_ rnai lines including dwarfism curly cauline leaves fused flower buds and bright green glossy _METHOD_ . to investigate if these phenotypes were caused by _PROTEIN_ cosuppression _PROTEIN_ transcript levels in a variety of tissues of transgenic plants were determined by rt pcr . as shown in supplemental figure in cauline leaves _METHOD_ and floral buds the organs exhibiting the most pronounced phenotypes _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were considerably lower than in the wild type . as previously reported for _PROTEIN_ fdh _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ both glossy and nonglossy atkcr rnai plants display clearly altered trichome morphology . as shown in figure trichomes are sparsely distributed have fused branches in glossy plants and have shorter or bent branches in nonglossy plants . scanning electron microscopy examination showed that the basal cells of these trichomes are swollen and bulging out of the epidermal surface . a further inspection of the surface of young leaves revealed impaired integrity of the epidermis in glossy plants . groups of cells appeared swollen to the point were they did not adhere tightly to each other resulting in deep intercellular grooves and probably contributing to the extreme sensitivity of glossy _PROTEIN_ rnai plants to dehydration . this type of abnormal epidermal structure could not be detected in nonglossy plants . organ fusions and stem glossiness observed in the _PROTEIN_ rnai plants are typically associated with defects in plant cuticles . cuticle abnormalities can be detected by a toluidine blue test which results in staining of organs with permeable cuticles . we used the tb test to evaluate cuticles of glossy line and nonglossy line individuals . the test resulted in complete staining of line glossy seedlings indicating severe cuticular abnormalities of this rnai line . nonglossy line seedlings displayed a range of partially stained patterns including patchy or random staining as observed for fdh and _PROTEIN_ mutants . because vlcfas are precursors of all the aliphatic components of cuticular wax we suspected that cuticle permeability of _PROTEIN_ rnai lines may at least in part be due to reduced wax accumulation . we therefore examined the glossy inflorescence stem surfaces of the _PROTEIN_ rnai plants by scanning electron microscopy . as shown in figure wild type _METHOD_ are densely covered with epicuticular wax crystals . in contrast glossy stem surfaces of _PROTEIN_ rnai plants are virtually devoid of wax crystals . wax analyses confirmed major reductions in wax loads in _PROTEIN_ rnai plants . the total wax coverage on wild type columbia inflorescence _METHOD_ under the conditions used here was per g fresh weight . in contrast wax loads measured in glossy _PROTEIN_ rnai plants reached per g fresh weight in line and per g fresh weight in line . quantification of wax components demonstrated that reduced wax loads were due to _PROTEIN_ accumulation of all compound classes . in nonglossy _PROTEIN_ rnai plants the _PROTEIN_ in wax load was far less pronounced and it was proportional to the levels of _PROTEIN_ transcripts detected in the stem of those plants . wax loads measured for nonglossy plants from lines and were and per g fresh weight respectively . however these data indicate that while lines and were phenotypically classified as nonglossy they do have a reduction in wax load as might be expected for plants with an impaired capacity to synthesize vlcfas . since arabidopsis leaves contain very low levels of vlcfas we analyzed the fatty acid composition in the roots of wild type and atkcr rnai plants that exhibit abnormal root morphology . a clear reduction in the content of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fatty acids was detected in glossy lines and . vlcfas accounted for of the total root fatty acid extracted from wild type col plants grown in this study predominantly reported in phospholipids such as phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine . the vlcfa content measured in glossy plants was reduced to and in lines and respectively . the vlcfa content in nonglossy plants was similar to that of wild type plants with and measured in lines and respectively . these results correlated well with the levels of vlcfas measured in the acyl coa pool in roots of the same plants . surprisingly in the root fatty acid methyl ester extracts prepared from glossy plants we detected three novel peaks that were either absent or low in wild type extracts . these peaks were tentatively identified by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ as and dicarboxylic acids and an hydroxy fatty acid compounds that are abundant in the cutin and suberin in arabidopsis . the presence of these usually highly polymerized constituents in the _PROTEIN_ rnai fame samples after mild methanolic acid extraction may reflect the altered composition and/or structure of the suberin when the synthesis of longer _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ compounds is reduced . the nonglossy plant extracts did not contain the three additional compounds founds in the roots of glossy plants . because arabidopsis seed oil also contains vlcfas we examined the fatty acid composition and content of mature dry seeds . compositional analyses of oil produced by the _PROTEIN_ rnai seeds revealed that only the oil from glossy plants was depleted in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids . the total vlcfas content in these seeds was about lower compared to the wild type . the larger seeds collected from both glossy and nonglossy _PROTEIN_ rnai plants had a higher fatty acid content than wild type seeds . overall the increase in total fatty acid content was largely proportional to the increase in seed size and did not result from a higher proportion of oil as a percentage of the seed weight . fatty acid composition of seed storage lipids in wild type and atkcr rnai lines each value is the mean of three independent measurements sd . gl glossy ngl nonglossy . to evaluate the effect of reduced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ on vlcfa incorporation into sphingolipids we analyzed the complex sphingolipid composition in the _METHOD_ of glossy and nonglossy _PROTEIN_ rnai plants that all exhibit abnormal shoot morphology . all the examined lines accumulated free long chain bases which are characteristic of impaired sphingolipid metabolism as reported for the yeast fae mutants . in addition a moderate but statistically significant _PROTEIN_ in almost all the sphingolipid species was detected . conversely neither the accumulation of free lcbs nor the reduction in any of the sphingolipid species could be detected in the _METHOD_ of morphologically normal plants . this suggests that the twisted shoot phenotype may also be caused by altered sphingolipid structure and not only the defective cuticular lipid composition as proposed for the fdh mutant .
