it has been known for decades that red light pretreatment has complex effects on subsequent phototropic sensitivity of etiolated seedlings . here we demonstrate that brief pulses of red light given h prior to phototropic induction by low fluence rates of blue light prevent the blue light induced loss of green _METHOD_ protein tagged phototropin _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of cortical cells of transgenic seedlings of arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in a _PROTEIN_ null mutant background . this red light effect is mediated by phytochrome a and requires h in the dark at room temperature to go to completion . it is fully far red reversible and shows escape from photoreversibility following min of subsequent darkness . red light induced inhibition of blue light inducible changes in the subcellular distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is only observed in rapidly elongating regions of the hypocotyl . it is absent in hook tissues and in mature cells below the elongation zone . we hypothesize that red light induced retention of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ may account for the red light induced increase in phototropic sensitivity to low fluence rates of blue light .
as blue light induces a loss of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and as red light sensitizes the phototropic response to low fluence rates of blue light we investigated whether red light treatment would affect the blue light activated phototropin relocalization we previously described . we first determined how much blue light is required to saturate the blue light induced _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ relocalization . using an external light source we administered blue light fluences ranging from to . we then examined the cortical cells of the elongation region of etiolated hypocotyls of arabidopsis seedlings using the confocal microscope for any changes in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ distribution after a h dark period . as shown in supplemental figure online the response was not induced by but was clearly detectable after exposure to or in agreement with our previous results . thus when we used an external light source in subsequent experiments instead of the microscope laser we used of blue light to make certain that the blue light response was saturated . a time course showing the effect of blue light alone is shown by the projection images in figure . for this experiment the blue light source was the laser in the confocal microscope . at time zero _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is relatively evenly distributed at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of these cortical cells from the elongation region of an etiolated arabidopsis hypocotyl . within min of the start of blue light irradiation some reorganization and mottling of the label is evident and this mottling increases over the course of an hour in all of the cells shown in the field . by min after the onset of blue light movement of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ into the cytoplasm can be observed in single optical sections of the cortical cells . these results confirm our previous results and provide a control for experiments investigating possible involvement of phytochrome in the phenomenon . the protein gel blot shown in supplemental figure online indicates that a fraction of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ released to the cytoplasm on blue light treatment is in the supernatant following centrifugation of seedling extracts for h at and is likely soluble . the experiment does not eliminate the possibility that some of the cytoplasmic _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ may still be _LOCATION_ associated but the results confirm previous observations by citation that a fraction of the released _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ can not be sedimented under the above conditions . the blue light induced movement of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ into the cytoplasm is not a general property of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins and is not indicative of a major endocytosis . figure shows the effect of blue light on three _METHOD_ labeled _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ an aquaporin _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ a brassinolide receptor and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ an aquaporin . none of the three marker proteins shows a change in distribution even after min of blue light treatment . these results are in sharp contrast with the dramatic effect of the same blue light treatment on _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . if a brief pulse of red light is given h prior to the onset of blue light treatment these dramatic changes in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ distribution are almost completely eliminated . the slight mottling seen in the red light treated cells in figure after blue light treatment stands in sharp contrast with the extensive relocalization response seen without the prior red light treatment . thus red light pretreatment appears to cause retention of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of these cells . the effect of red light in preventing the movement of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ into the cytoplasm is illustrated in the single optical sections shown in figure . the h dark period was chosen as it was the time period used in virtually all of the physiological experiments cited in the introduction investigating the effect of red light preirradiation on subsequent phototropic responses . to test whether a brief pulse of red light affected phototropism under our growth conditions we tested the phototropic responses of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ lines with or without prior red light treatment . a h dark incubation period followed the red treatment . in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is the only functional phototropin . in the line both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are functional . in the _PROTEIN_ line only _PROTEIN_ is functional . furthermore a blue light fluence rate of can only activate _PROTEIN_ whereas activates both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . effect of red light on subsequent blue light induced phototropic curvature at blue light fluence rates of either or red light significantly enhanced the response of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line after both and h exposure . when _PROTEIN_ alone is functional _PROTEIN_ red light treatment also significantly enhanced the phototropic response . the line irradiated with of blue light failed to show strong enhancement possibly because both red light treated and control seedlings had reached the saturation level for curvature . when the blue light fluence rate was some enhancement occurred although the enhancement was less than seen in the other lines . the _PROTEIN_ line failed to curve in response to as it lacked _PROTEIN_ and the fluence rate was too low to activate _PROTEIN_ . we conclude that under the conditions we used to demonstrate a red light effect on blue light induced _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ relocalization the same red light treatment enhances the phototropic response mediated by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . since of red light administered h prior to blue light treatment was sufficient to reduce blue light induced relocalization dramatically we investigated how much dark time was required between red light pretreatment and a blue light pulse for the red light to be effective . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ relocalization was then allowed to proceed for min in darkness following the blue light pulse prior to observation with the confocal microscope . the results are shown in figure . red light administered or min prior to blue light was essentially ineffective . in all three cases blue light induced movement of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ into the cytoplasm . however by h after red light treatment the effect of blue light was eliminated . this effect of red light persisted at least for an additional hour . we next asked how much red light was required to prevent the effect of blue light on the subcellular distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the elongating hypocotyl cells . the results are shown in figure and figure . the red light effect was saturated between and in both experiments . this range is well within that to be expected for a classic low fluence phytochrome response . furthermore the reciprocity law holds under these experimental conditions . if the effect of red light is indeed a low fluence phytochrome response one would expect it to be fully far red reversible . indeed of far red completely reversed the effect of red light . figure shows that the effect of blue light was diminished if of red light was followed immediately by the far red treatment . the appearance of the cells min after the blue light pulse is virtually identical to that of blue light without any red pretreatment and essentially indistinguishable from that seen in figure . as expected red light alone almost eliminated the blue light response . we next investigated how much far red light is required to reverse the effect of red light . the results are shown in figure which presents cells near the bottom of the hypocotyl elongation zone . far red light was sufficient to reverse the effect of red light . finally we investigated the time course for escape from far red reversibility . the results are shown in figure . _PROTEIN_ of when far red light was given the total dark period was always h. with a min dark period between red and far red treatment the effect of far red light in reversing the red light effect was diminished and with a min dark period after red light far red light was completely ineffective . hence the consequences of red light treatment become fixed relatively rapidly although they are not fully _PROTEIN_ until h has passed following red light treatment . we were puzzled that we did not always obtain an effect of red light in preventing subsequent blue light induced _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ relocalization . we identified two reasons for this variability first if the hypocotyls are handled a little roughly some _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ relocalization occurred in the absence of any blue light treatment . we solved this problem by mounting the seedlings carefully on agar . however some variability still persisted . the effect of red light in blocking blue light inducible _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ movement into the cytoplasm had a developmental component . we found that the standard red light fluence had little effect on blue light induced _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ distribution in the hook or in the mature cells below the elongation zone but prevented the blue light effect in the elongation zone . it was logistically possible in these experiments to observe two regions from the same seedlings but not three . thus the images shown in the center and bottom panels of figure were taken from the same seedlings but those in the top panel were from a different seedling . experiments shown in figure indicate that substantial blue light induced _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ relocalization can be observed well before min from the onset of blue light treatment . however no effect is detectable after min in the elongation zone cells given prior to red light treatment . by contrast by min there is a strong effect of blue light both above and below the elongation zone despite red light pretreatment . thus the interaction between phytochrome and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ develops as cells enter their elongation phase and is lost when they are mature . since the red light effect is restricted to the hypocotyl elongation zone we were unable to detect a red light induced _PROTEIN_ in the level of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the soluble fraction . it is likely that a red induced _PROTEIN_ in the amount of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ released to the cytoplasm in the elongation zone in response to blue light treatment would be masked by its blue light induced release in the cotyledons hook and mature hypocotyl tissues especially given the large amount of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ detectable in the cotyledons and hook . this latter release is unaffected by the red light treatment . we made crosses for plants carrying the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene in the _PROTEIN_ null background with strong mutant alleles of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and with the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant to identify the phytochrome that mediated the red light response described above . the seedlings were given of red light h of darkness a blue light pulse and min of darkness prior to observation with the confocal microscope . in the _PROTEIN_ mutant red light still blocks blue light induced relocalization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ whereas in the _PROTEIN_ mutant blue light induces normal relocalization despite the prior red light treatment . as expected from these results the response of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant is no different from that of the _PROTEIN_ mutant there is no red light effect . thus the red light induced inhibition of blue light activated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ relocalization from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ is mediated by _PROTEIN_ . from following subsequent generations we identified the three classes of phytochrome mutant lines in which _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was the only functioning _PROTEIN_ . red light treatment still prevented the blue light induced relocalization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the absence of wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as long as functional _PROTEIN_ protein was present .
we used the _PROTEIN_ mutant of arabidopsis thaliana transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructed by citation . seeds were surface sterilized and plated onto half strength murashige and skoog medium containing agar and sucrose . the plates were held in darkness for d at and then exposed to red light for h to induce uniform germination . the seedlings were then grown in complete darkness at for d. the mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ kindly provided by peter h. quail were crossed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants . seeds were selected under red or far red light and seedlings with long hypocotyls were screened for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . to confirm the _PROTEIN_ mutant background we performed pcr genotyping with forward primer gcaggtacatagagctagagc and reverse primer _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ mutation deleted the primary site for the forward primer and therefore produced no pcr product . the wild type _PROTEIN_ gene yielded a pcr product of kb while the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion produced a band of kb . we selected plants that only produced the kb product . the red light source to induce germination consisted of two w red _METHOD_ tubes filtered through one layer of rohm and haas red plexiglas . the red light source used to treat the seedlings was a bank of _PROTEIN_ . the source of far red light was a v w tungsten halogen lamp filtered through a rohm and haas frf plexiglas filter . the different fluence rates used in the individual experiments are provided above . for certain experiments the source of blue light was the laser in the confocal microscope . for other experiments except phototropism it was a bank of _PROTEIN_ . unless otherwise indicated the fluence rate from blue light sources was . for phototropism experiments the blue light sources were either two _METHOD_ lamps with the light passed through a blue plexiglas filter or a kodak carousel slide projector equipped with a corning blue filter . as mentioned above even slight physical damage could cause the loss of some _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to the cytoplasm . to avoid this physical damage a layer of agar dissolved in distilled water was allowed to solidify between two cover slips . when it had hardened the upper cover slip was slid off and the seedlings were gently placed on the remaining agar bed on the lower cover slip . a cover slip was then gently placed over the seedling and the assembly was turned over and transferred to the microscope upside down . uniform _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ on initial observation with the confocal microscope was taken as evidence that no damage had occurred . all images were acquired with a nikon inverted _METHOD_ microscope equipped with appropriate nikon water immersion objective lenses and a bio rad mrc confocal head . all experiments were repeated three or more times with results similar to those presented above . phototropism experiments were performed as described elsewhere . three day old seedlings were treated with red light and returned to darkness for h prior to blue light treatment . blue fluence rates were either or and exposure times were either or h. the plates of seedlings were scanned and the hypocotyl images were analyzed with _PROTEIN_ imagej software . representative data from four different experiments are shown . in all phototropism experiments the curvatures of or more seedlings were measured for each data point with similar results . total protein was extracted from control or blue light treated seedlings under dim red light as described elsewhere . the extract was centrifuged for min at rpm in an eppendorf tabletop centrifuge to sediment cell walls larger organelles and cellular debris not fully broken up . the supernatant was then centrifuged for h at to obtain soluble and _LOCATION_ fractions . subsequent steps were as described . sequence data from this article can be found in the arabidopsis genome initiative or genbank/embl databases under the following accession numbers _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the following materials are
