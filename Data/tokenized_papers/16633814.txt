the phytohormone abscisic acid regulates essential growth and developmental processes in plants . recently rna binding proteins have been described as components of aba signaling during germination . we have identified ten aba regulated rna binding proteins in arabidopsis seedlings . among those genes _PROTEIN_ and are highly _PROTEIN_ in seedlings . using promoter reporter gene analyses we showed that both _PROTEIN_ and were in particular _PROTEIN_ in photosynthetically active organs like green cotyledons leaves and petioles . the analysis of _METHOD_ fusion proteins demonstrates that localized to chloroplasts and _PROTEIN_ to chloroplasts and stromules . whereas rna binding of has previously been shown we demonstrated through in vitro rna binding assays that recombinant _PROTEIN_ binds to rna and that chloroplast _PROTEIN_ rna can serve as a target of _PROTEIN_ . developmental or environmental stimuli affected the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and in seedlings . both genes were repressed during senescence but only _PROTEIN_ was significantly repressed upon water stress . in addition _PROTEIN_ and exhibited low _PROTEIN_ in etiolated seedlings compared to green seedlings and was regulated during the day photoperiod . homozygous t dna insertion lines were isolated characterized on the molecular level and monitored for phenotypic changes . taken together the data show that both proteins are regulated during processes that are known to involve aba signaling . their localization in chloroplasts and rna binding activity suggest a role in chloroplast rna metabolism in arabidopsis seedlings .
in a recent study we investigated aba responsive gene _PROTEIN_ at the whole genome level in arabidopsis seedlings ecotype landsberg _LOCATION_ using _METHOD_ parallel signature sequencing _PROTEIN_ . upon treatment of the seedlings with aba about genes displayed a significant change in transcript abundance . among those were ten genes that encode putative rna binding proteins based on similarity to known proteins or the prediction of an rna binding motif . while only two genes _GENE_ and were aba induced the remainder showed reduced transcript abundances after aba treatment . microarray data derived from aba treated columbia and wassilewskija seedlings that were available from genevestigator indicated similar aba regulation for six of the ten genes . from these six genes we selected two genes exhibiting strongest _PROTEIN_ in seedlings namely _GENE_ and _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ for further analyses . whereas aba repression of _PROTEIN_ has been approved by rna gel blot experiments we confirmed the repression of by aba through rt pcr analyses of rna samples from wild type plants that were treated for h with aba or mock solution . to approach the possible function of and _PROTEIN_ in growth development and stress response we studied the _PROTEIN_ pattern of both genes during the plant life cycle . we generated promoter reporter gene plants to study the distribution of and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . for analysis of _PROTEIN_ we studied promoter gus and promoter _METHOD_ plants . gus activity was detected in cotyledons in the hypocotyl in the shoot apex in adult leaves and petioles and in sepals . using confocal laser scanning microscopy we observed promoter driven _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in epidermis and guard cells of the lower and upper side of leaves and in trichomes . however we did not detect gus staining in all trichomes and can thus not exclude that _METHOD_ synthesized in epidermis cells symplastically moved into trichomes . analyses of _PROTEIN_ promoter gus and _PROTEIN_ promoter _METHOD_ plants revealed the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the hypocotyls and cotyledons of young seedlings . in older seedlings _PROTEIN_ promoter driven _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was detected by confocal laser scanning microscopy in the lower and upper side of all leaves tested as well as in the petiole . an optical z section through the lower side of leaves elucidated that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was limited to the outer epidermal cell layer including guard cells . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in trichomes was indicated by _PROTEIN_ promoter driven _METHOD_ and gus _PROTEIN_ . in addition _PROTEIN_ promoter driven gus activity was found in hydathodes of adult leaves sepals and in siliques . the shown data for both genes are in agreement with the microarray _PROTEIN_ data summarized in the gene atlas of genevestigator . we also studied the regulation of gene _PROTEIN_ by environmental and developmental signals to gain insights into gene function . with respect to the aba repression of _PROTEIN_ and we investigated the regulation of these genes during processes that have been suggested to involve aba . in vivo imaging experiments on transgenic arabidopsis plants that exhibit aba dependent reporter activation showed that water stress applied to the root system increased aba pools in the shoot and with a certain delay in cotelydons . to test whether water stress affects the _PROTEIN_ of the two aba repressed genes we incubated col seedlings for h in the presence and absence of mm mannitol . using rt pcr analyses we observed that transcript levels were not or only weakly affected . however there was a pronounced repression of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . correspondingly _PROTEIN_ promoter gus plants showed strong gus activity in cotyledons after incubation in the absence of mannitol but staining was very weak after incubation on mm mannitol . the quantification of the gene _PROTEIN_ data by real time rt pcr revealed a fold repression for _PROTEIN_ . this mannitol repression of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ that we have shown by two independent approaches is consistent with _PROTEIN_ data that were collected by kudla and colleagues and are summarized in the genevestigator . another physiological response that can be promoted by aba is leaf senescence . we therefore studied gene _PROTEIN_ during leaf senescence in week old col plants that showed _METHOD_ of senescence namely yellowing of leaves . for that purpose we harvested green leaves early senescent leaves and leaves showing progression of senescence . _PROTEIN_ of was only slightly diminished but _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was strongly repressed during the senescence process in leaves . real time rt pcr experiments that were performed on rna samples of three independent treatments indicated a fold repression for and a fold repression for _PROTEIN_ during the senescence process from green leaves to leaves that showed progression of senescence . in early senescent leaves only _PROTEIN_ was significantly repressed . during the determination of the tissue specific _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ the staining of leaves that were cut from _PROTEIN_ promoter gus plants for gus activity revealed _PROTEIN_ promoter activity at the sites of injury . the role of aba during the response of plants to wounding is still unclear . it has been suggested to be involved in the general _PROTEIN_ of plant physiology upon injury rather than in defense gene activation . the regulation of _PROTEIN_ by wounding was tested in more detail via incisions in leaves and via soft pressure that was applied by pressing one side of the leaf between two fingers . histochemical analyses revealed that gus activity was induced specifically at the wounding sites . to exclude the possibility that the increased gus activity at the sites of wounding may simply result from a better accessibility for the substrate into the injured tissue cell free extracts were received from tissues that had been wounded via incisions and from untreated control tissues . gus activities in these extracts were determined via the hydrolysis induced _METHOD_ of the gus substrate methylumbelliferyl d _PROTEIN_ . whereas strong _METHOD_ was observed in wounded _PROTEIN_ promoter gus leaf tissues the signal was significantly lower in untreated leaves from the identical plants . the weak _METHOD_ in control tissues might derive from the wound induction at the cutting site of the petiole . from three independent experiments we determined a wound induction of fold . some aba mediated processes in plants also depend on the light environment . we therefore studied gene _PROTEIN_ during the day photoperiod under short day conditions . the _PROTEIN_ of but not _PROTEIN_ showed a diurnally regulated increase in the afternoon towards the end of the photoperiod . the _PROTEIN_ stayed on a high level for additional h in darkness before returning to the basal _PROTEIN_ level . this peak of _PROTEIN_ was highly similar under long day conditions thus indicating that is regulated by circadian rhythm . in agreement with this assumption was found to be under clock control following data from the genevestigator . these data that were collected in continous white light also showed a peak _PROTEIN_ in the same time interval . we also studied the _PROTEIN_ of both genes in day old etiolated seedlings in comparison to green seedlings . both genes and _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ to only low levels in etiolated seedlings but their _PROTEIN_ was strongly increased after greening . as an approach towards the functional understanding of the rna binding proteins we studied the subcellular localization of and _PROTEIN_ . for that purpose we generated dna constructs that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins driven by the camv promoter . from in vitro import assays of precursors into isolated pea chloroplasts it has been suggested that is a chloroplast located protein . this prediction was supported by studies of the chloroplast proteome . we were aiming at the in vivo verification of the localization by detecting the _METHOD_ fusion protein in living cells using noninvasive confocal laser scanning microscopy . following particle bombardment of onion epidermis cells with the promoter _METHOD_ dna construct _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was found in spots that had the size of _LOCATION_ . in leaves of transgenic promoter _METHOD_ tobacco plants the _METHOD_ signal was detected in small _LOCATION_ in the epidermal cell layer . no previous localization data were available for _PROTEIN_ . following the same approach as for we transiently _PROTEIN_ an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein in onion and tobacco leaf cells . the _METHOD_ signal in a bombarded tobacco guard cell indicated the targeting of _PROTEIN_ to chloroplasts . in onion epidermis cells the fusion protein also localized to small spots that were likely _LOCATION_ structures . in addition these structures exhibited protruding fibers that were reminiscent to stromules . the localization in chloroplasts and stromules was confirmed in leaves of transgenic promoter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ arabidopsis plants . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was strong in tissues of high stromule density like the hypocotyl and cotyledons . _PROTEIN_ encodes a protein of amino acids with similarity to the spinach _PROTEIN_ protein that has been shown to bind to rna . in contrast to _PROTEIN_ that shares amino acid sequence identity to _PROTEIN_ from spinach _PROTEIN_ shares only about amino acid sequence identity to the spinach protein . to examine whether _PROTEIN_ can bind to rna we carried out in vitro binding assays with recombinant _PROTEIN_ . his tagged _PROTEIN_ protein was _PROTEIN_ in e. coli and purified under denaturing conditions together with proteins that served as positive or as negative controls in the rna binding experiment _PROTEIN_ . after separation of the purified proteins via _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ we observed prominent bands for _PROTEIN_ and together with several faster migrating bands of lower abundance . these smaller proteins could be detected by anti his antibodies in western blot experiments suggesting that they corresponded to c terminally truncated _METHOD_ of the respective protein . in northwestern blot experiments using a utp labeled kb viral rna substrate we observed a signal corresponding to the full length _PROTEIN_ . an even stronger signal was detected with a truncated _PROTEIN_ protein which could be due to a more efficient renaturation of this subdomain of the protein into a functional rna binding motif . rna binding to a truncated protein in addition to the full length protein also occurred for his tagged that was used as a positive control . in contrast rna binding was absent in both negative controls his tagged and _PROTEIN_ . for the spinach protein strong specificity for the _PROTEIN_ rna sequence has been demonstrated . the _PROTEIN_ gene encodes subunit iv of the cytochrome b complex . to identify a target rna for _PROTEIN_ we investigated binding to _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis . indeed full length _PROTEIN_ as well as the truncated form could bind _PROTEIN_ rna in northwestern blotting experiments . to further confirm rna binding by _PROTEIN_ a gel retardation analysis was performed as an alternative experimental approach . for this the _PROTEIN_ tagged proteins _PROTEIN_ and were _PROTEIN_ in cells and affinity purified using anti _PROTEIN_ affinity gel . as determined by western blot analysis only full length _PROTEIN_ was purified from mammalian cells . equal amounts of the purified proteins _PROTEIN_ and were then incubated together with a labeled rna probe derived from the end of the hcmv gene . after native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis retarded rna protein complexes were detected via autoradiography . as shown in fig . the addition of increasing amounts of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ resulted in a strong retardation of the rna probe which was also observed for the known rna binding protein _PROTEIN_ . in contrast no significant retardation was detected with the rna binding deficient mutant protein . in summary this demonstrates that full length _PROTEIN_ could bind to rna in vitro indicating its function as an rna binding protein . to gain insight into the physiological functions of _PROTEIN_ and we sought to assess the consequences of loss of _PROTEIN_ or . we isolated homozygous t dna insertion lines _PROTEIN_ from segregating seeds corresponding to stock number from the salk collection . however the insertion that was localized to position upstream of the start _PROTEIN_ did not cause a significant change of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ seedlings indicating that the truncated promoter is sufficient to mediate wild type like _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . for we established the homozygous t dna insertion line from segregating lines originally received from the salk institute . sequence analysis identified the insertional site in exon iii after bases following the start _PROTEIN_ . we determined left border sequence on both sides of the t dna suggesting that the insertion occurred in tandem orientation . rt pcr analysis failed to detect full length transcript in the mutant . however we detected the _PROTEIN_ of a truncated transcript in front of the insertion . the mutant plants did not have any visible whole plant growth phenotype under long or short day conditions respectively . hypocotyl elongation was not affected in the mutant plants . mutant plants did also not differ from wild type plants during drought response dark induced senescence or greening of etiolated seedlings after transfer to light . _PROTEIN_ the aba regulation of we investigated aba dependent germination and growth that represents a classical assay for aba signaling mutants . however the mutation did not result in phenotypic differences in the presence of or aba when compared to wild type .

to bombard the lower epidermis of tobacco leaves or the inner epidermis of white onion peels under vacuum using _METHOD_ helium pulses of bar . after bombardment leaves and onion peels were incubated for h on agar plates containing murashige and skoog medium and m mannitol . high resolution images of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were made with a confocal laser scanning microscope _METHOD_ using

gaaacattttctgtgaacgattcct for actin . real time rt pcrs were carried out using a rotorgene and the sybr green pcr master mix from qiagen . samples were standardized to the actin mrna levels . for the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in e. coli we amplified a bp ecori/xhoi fragment from the _PROTEIN_ cdna _METHOD_ fusion construct using primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the pcr amplified open reading frame encoding for _PROTEIN_ was cloned into zero blunt topo and sequenced . thereafter it was inserted into the _PROTEIN_ vector via sphi and psti restriction sites by pcr cloning using primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which allows the _PROTEIN_ of a recombinant protein as fusion with a leader peptide containing a hexahistidyl sequence . an eukaryotic _PROTEIN_ vector for _PROTEIN_ was generated by pcr amplification of the _PROTEIN_ cdna using primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ followed by insertion into vector _PROTEIN_ via ecori and xhoi . this vector could be used for _PROTEIN_ of a _PROTEIN_ tagged
