the plant hormone jasmonate activates gene _PROTEIN_ by promoting ubiquitin dependent degradation of jasmonate _PROTEIN_ domain transcriptional repressor proteins . a key feature of all jaz proteins is the highly conserved jas motif which mediates both jaz degradation and jaz binding to the transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . rapid _PROTEIN_ of jaz genes in response to ja is thought to attenuate ja responses but little is known about the _METHOD_ by which newly synthesized jaz proteins exert repression in the presence of the hormone . here we show in arabidopsis that desensitization to ja is mediated by an alternative splice variant _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ that lacks the jas motif . unbiased protein protein interaction screens identified three related basic helix loop helix transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the corepressor _PROTEIN_ as _PROTEIN_ binding partners . we show that the amino terminal region of _PROTEIN_ contains a cryptic _PROTEIN_ binding site that resembles the jas motif and that the _PROTEIN_ motif of _PROTEIN_ functions as a transferable repressor domain whose activity is associated with the recruitment of _PROTEIN_ . functional studies showed that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ from the native _PROTEIN_ promoter complemented the ja hypersensitive phenotype of a _PROTEIN_ mutant . moreover treatment of these complemented lines with ja resulted in the rapid accumulation of _PROTEIN_ protein . our results provide an explanation for how the unique domain architecture of _PROTEIN_ links transcription _PROTEIN_ to a corepressor complex and suggest how ja induced transcription and alternative splicing of _PROTEIN_ premessenger rna creates a regulatory circuit to attenuate ja responses .
as an unbiased approach to identify binding partners of _PROTEIN_ we performed a high throughput yeast two hybrid screen for arabidopsis proteins that interact with _PROTEIN_ . sequence information obtained from positive clones produced a list of putative interacting proteins . based on calculated confidence scores five proteins were categorized as high confidence interactors _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and general regulating _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was not identified as a _PROTEIN_ interacting protein in planta and thus was not characterized further . sequencing of positive clones provided information on the minimal interaction domain of each prey protein . the results suggested that _PROTEIN_ interacts with the n terminal region of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and the c terminal region of _PROTEIN_ . these findings are in agreement with previous studies showing that most full length jazs _PROTEIN_ interact with the n terminus of myc tfs and that _PROTEIN_ interacts with the c terminal region of _PROTEIN_ . as an alternative approach to identify _PROTEIN_ interacting partners we used _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ to identify proteins that copurify with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in cultured arabidopsis cells . the utility of this system for studying jaz proteins was assessed by an analysis of cell lines _PROTEIN_ yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusions of each _PROTEIN_ splice variant . confocal microscopy and western blot analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulate to higher levels than _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in both control and ja treated cells . this finding is consistent with previous studies showing that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are more stable than _PROTEIN_ in ja treated seedlings . _METHOD_ based analysis of coimmunoprecipitated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ complexes identified _PROTEIN_ as a major copurifying protein . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were also identified as _PROTEIN_ interacting partners in at least two of the four replicate experiments . we also identified _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as components of the _PROTEIN_ complex which is in agreement with studies showing that jazs form heteromeric complexes with other _PROTEIN_ domain containing proteins . these collective findings show that _PROTEIN_ interacts in vivo with _PROTEIN_ and the basic helix loop helix tfs _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . nd not detected . the ability of _PROTEIN_ to interact with _PROTEIN_ was unexpected because previous studies have shown that the jas motif which is not present in _PROTEIN_ is necessary and sufficient for interaction with _PROTEIN_ . we used assays to map the _PROTEIN_ interacting domain of _PROTEIN_ . the strength of the _PROTEIN_ interaction with _PROTEIN_ in this assay was comparable to that of the jas motif containing full length splice variant _PROTEIN_ . deletion of the _PROTEIN_ domain abolished _PROTEIN_ dimerization but did not affect _PROTEIN_ interaction with _PROTEIN_ as reported previously . however constructs lacking the n terminal amino acids _PROTEIN_ or lacking only amino acid residues to _PROTEIN_ failed to bind _PROTEIN_ . systematic deletion analysis identified a amino acid fragment _PROTEIN_ that is sufficient for _PROTEIN_ interaction . interestingly this cryptic _PROTEIN_ interacting domain contains a nine amino acid sequence that strongly resembles the core of the jas motif of _PROTEIN_ and other jaz proteins including a tribasic cluster of residues . in the jas motif of _PROTEIN_ the central r residue within the tribasic cluster is essential for interaction with _PROTEIN_ . to assess whether the tribasic cluster in the _PROTEIN_ cmid plays a role in _PROTEIN_ binding we mutated each arg residue individually and in combination to an ala and tested the resulting constructs for interaction with _PROTEIN_ . single and double substitutions had no effect on _PROTEIN_ binding in yeast . however substitution of all three residues abolished _PROTEIN_ binding but did not affect _PROTEIN_ dimerization . we also _PROTEIN_ wild type and mutant _PROTEIN_ versions of _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli as maltose binding protein jaz fusions and tested these proteins in pull down assays for their ability to bind a cmyc tagged derivative of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . the results verified that the motif of _PROTEIN_ is required for _PROTEIN_ binding . to determine whether the cmid of _PROTEIN_ is sufficient for _PROTEIN_ binding we fused the n terminal amino acids of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to the c terminus of a _PROTEIN_ derivative _PROTEIN_ that lacks the entire jas motif and thus does not interact with _PROTEIN_ . pull down assays showed that fusion of _PROTEIN_ to the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ partially restores interaction with _PROTEIN_ . introduction of the mutation into the full length _PROTEIN_ isoform had no effect on _PROTEIN_ binding presumably because _PROTEIN_ contains an intact jas motif . to determine whether the cmid is required for _PROTEIN_ function in vivo we compared ja responses in transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ that overexpress _METHOD_ fusions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in agreement with previous studies of all _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants tested exhibited hallmark characteristics of ja associated male sterility including short anther filaments and reduced anther dehiscence . root growth inhibition assays also showed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ seedlings were strongly insensitive to ja . all _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines were fully fertile and showed no signs of ja associated male sterility . experiments performed with seedlings that are homozygous for the transgene further showed that the sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ seedlings to ja is comparable to that of wild type seedlings . confocal microscopy analysis showed that both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localize to the _LOCATION_ of trichome cells . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ also showed _LOCATION_ localization in roots although the signal was more diffuse _LOCATION_ than that of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . this suggests that the inability of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to repress ja responses does not result from mislocalization of the jaz fusion protein . taken together the results indicate that the n terminal region of _PROTEIN_ contains a cryptic _PROTEIN_ binding site that is required for _PROTEIN_ mediated repression of ja responses . the identification of _PROTEIN_ as a _PROTEIN_ interacting protein suggests that repression of ja responses by _PROTEIN_ involves recruitment of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ corepressor complex to the _PROTEIN_ domain of _PROTEIN_ . to address this question we tested whether the _PROTEIN_ domain of _PROTEIN_ is capable of conferring repressive activity on a jaz that binds _PROTEIN_ but fails to associate with the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ corepressor complex . we took advantage of the _PROTEIN_ that repression of ja responses by _PROTEIN_ does not depend on its _PROTEIN_ domain but rather relies on an ear motif at the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ that directly binds _PROTEIN_ . a mutant _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ lacking the ear motif does not interact with _PROTEIN_ and is unable to repress ja responses . a chimeric protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in which the _PROTEIN_ domain of _PROTEIN_ was replaced with the _PROTEIN_ domain of _PROTEIN_ exhibited strong interaction with _PROTEIN_ in yeast . in root growth assays transgenic lines that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ from the promoter exhibited a ja insensitive phenotype identical to that of _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines . thus the _PROTEIN_ domain of _PROTEIN_ restores repression activity to a jaz variant _PROTEIN_ that binds _PROTEIN_ but is unable to recruit the corepressor complex . the highly conserved ile residue of the _PROTEIN_ domain is required both for _PROTEIN_ dimerization and the repression of ja responses by _PROTEIN_ . given that _PROTEIN_ represses ja responses through its interaction with the _PROTEIN_ domain of jaz we tested whether ile of _PROTEIN_ may also be important for interaction with _PROTEIN_ . assays showed that whereas substitution of ile to ala eliminates _PROTEIN_ dimerization this mutation reduced but did not abolish _PROTEIN_ interaction with _PROTEIN_ . a mutation had no effect on _PROTEIN_ binding to either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ suggesting that the effect is specific for ile . in vitro pull down assays confirmed that eliminates _PROTEIN_ dimerization and reduces the extent to which _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ analysis of protein complexes immunopurified from cells provided additional evidence that disrupts the ability of _PROTEIN_ to copurify with _PROTEIN_ . based on the number of assigned _METHOD_ spectra corresponding to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we estimated that the amount of _PROTEIN_ copurifying with _PROTEIN_ was less than of that copurifying with wild type _PROTEIN_ . these findings show that ile is not only critical for _PROTEIN_ dimerization but also suggest a key role for this residue in stabilizing the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction . to further test the hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ participates in a negative feedback loop to restrain ja responses we tested whether _PROTEIN_ of this splice variant from the native _PROTEIN_ promoter is sufficient to attenuate ja responses . for these experiments we used a kb _PROTEIN_ promoter fragment that confers ja inducible _PROTEIN_ of a gus reporter gene . a hemagglutinin epitope tag was added to the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ to facilitate protein detection in plant tissues . the resulting ha _PROTEIN_ transgene was introduced into the _PROTEIN_ mutant that is hypersensitive to ja induced root growth inhibition . of eight lines that were confirmed to contain a single segregating copy of the transgene all were significantly less sensitive to exogenous methyl jasmonate than _PROTEIN_ seedlings . further analysis of five representative ha _PROTEIN_ lines showed that all but one line were also less sensitive than _PROTEIN_ to meja . on medium containing meja root growth of some lines was significantly less sensitive than that of wild type seedlings . this finding suggests that differences in the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ between transgenic lines may modulate sensitivity to ja . we used immunoblot analysis to test whether the level of ja induced accumulation of _PROTEIN_ in specific transgenic lines correlates with observed differences in root growth sensitivity to ja . lines that exhibited either wild type like or reduced sensitivity to the hormone were grown in liquid murashige and skoog medium and treated with meja . at various times after treatment seedlings were harvested for western blot analysis with an anti ha antibody . we detected the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ protein in both lines within h of treatment . in the case of line _PROTEIN_ protein levels steadily increased during the h time course . in the moderately ja insensitive line however ja treatment resulted in a much stronger accumulation of _PROTEIN_ with protein levels peaking at h and then declining slowly at _PROTEIN_ time points . these results show that _PROTEIN_ when _PROTEIN_ from the native _PROTEIN_ promoter rapidly accumulates in response to ja treatment and that the strength of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ inversely correlates with the level of sensitivity to ja .
