the sub cellular location of enzymes of fatty acid oxidation in plants is controversial . in the current debate the role and location of particular thiolases in fatty acid degradation fatty acid synthesis and isoleucine degradation are important . the aim of this research was to determine the sub cellular location and hence provide information about possible functions of all the putative ketoacyl coa thiolases and acetoacetyl coa thiolases in arabidopsis . arabidopsis has three genes predicted to encode kats one of which encodes two polypeptides that differ at the n terminal end . _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis cells of cdnas encoding each of these kats fused to green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ at their c termini showed that three are targeted to _LOCATION_ while the fourth is apparently _LOCATION_ . the four kats are also predicted to have mitochondrial targeting sequences but purified mitochondria were unable to import any of the proteins in vitro . arabidopsis also has two genes encoding a total of five different putative acats . one isoform is targeted to _LOCATION_ as a fusion with _METHOD_ while the others display no targeting in vivo as _METHOD_ fusions or import into isolated mitochondria . analysis of gene co _PROTEIN_ clusters in arabidopsis suggests a role for peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ in oxidation while _PROTEIN_ co _PROTEIN_ with genes of the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ clearly co _PROTEIN_ with genes of the _LOCATION_ mevalonate biosynthesis pathway . we conclude that kats and acats are present in the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ but are not found in mitochondria . the implications for fatty acid oxidation and for isoleucine degradation in mitochondria are discussed .
searches of the arabidopsis genome identify five loci with sequence similarity to genes encoding known thiolase proteins . comparison of predicted amino acid sequences shows that they fall into two classes . three loci encode the type i class of enzyme kat and typically involved in acetyl coa formation in fatty acid oxidation by removal of a _PROTEIN_ chain from a ketoacyl coa . the other two genes encode the type ii class of enzyme acat and typically involved in acetoacetyl coa formation from two molecules of acetyl coa . the type i genes have previously been annotated as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ based on the chromosome on which they are found . all three are closely related to known peroxisomal located type i thiolases in human mouse and yeast and this cluster also contains representatives from the fungus neurospora crassa and the monocot rice . the _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ bound type i mitochondrial thiolases involved in fatty acid degradation in human mouse and drosophila cluster separately and do not contain members from the completed genome sequences of fungi arabidopsis or rice . the two arabidopsis type ii thiolases _PROTEIN_ cluster with the known _LOCATION_ type ii thiolases from yeast and the _LOCATION_ and mitochondrial type ii thiolases from human mouse and drosophila . the monocot rice also has two type ii thiolases that cluster in this set and n. crassa contains a single type ii gene that clusters with the yeast _LOCATION_ type ii protein . the sequence divergence of mitochondrial type i thiolases in mammals from the peroxisomal type i kats in plants fungi and animals makes the presence of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis mitochondria appear unlikely based on phylogenetic evidence if thiolase location is conserved . however the sequence analysis does not define the location of the type ii acat proteins in arabidopsis and leaves open the possibility of a mitochondrial location of at least one of these proteins especially given the presence of multiple type ii thiolases in both plants and mammals . analysis of est sequences and tiling array data shows that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ loci each encode single polypeptide sequences . in contrast _PROTEIN_ encodes two proteins that differ at the n terminus due to alternative rna splicing that generates either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ exons . the n terminal sequences of proteins encoded by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ include putative _PROTEIN_ type sequences while the protein encoded by _PROTEIN_ does not . interestingly proteins encoded by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins are predicted to be targeted to mitochondria by at least two of three different _METHOD_ . analysis of est sequences and tiling array data shows that and _PROTEIN_ loci also encode three and two proteins respectively . differential rna splicing results in the protein encoded by lacking ten amino acids at the c terminus relative to the protein encoded by . the protein has different amino acid residues at the n terminus relative to . none of the proteins has predicted organelle targeting information . differential rna splicing also accounts for the n terminal amino acid residues of the protein encoded by _PROTEIN_ being replaced by different amino acid residues in the case of the protein encoded by _PROTEIN_ . neither protein has predicted organelle targeting information . to localize thiolases in vivo _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusions were employed . _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ have been used extensively to study protein targeting to mitochondria _LOCATION_ and chloroplasts . to demonstrate specific mitochondrial and peroxisomal targeting in vivo and our ability to distinguish the two an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct and an _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct were employed . the two gene constructs were co delivered into arabidopsis suspension culture cells using a biolistic gene gun . after h individual cells _PROTEIN_ both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were imaged . the results show that _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were targeted to discrete organelles consistent with specific targeting to mitochondria and _LOCATION_ respectively . to examine thiolase targeting we made translational fusions with _METHOD_ at the c terminus since peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ and mitochondrial targeting sequences are both n terminal . thiolase cdnas encoding all nine proteins were linked to the _METHOD_ coding region and cloned downstream of the camv promoter . they were each delivered into arabidopsis suspension culture cells together with the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct . after h individual cells _PROTEIN_ both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were imaged and the images merged . the results show that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and acat were targeted to _LOCATION_ as indicated by coincidence of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ images . in contrast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ show diffuse _METHOD_ throughout the cell indicating that no specific targeting to any organelle has occurred suggesting a _LOCATION_ localization . with peroxisomal targeting of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and acat although it was apparent that the patterns of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were essentially identical the higher intensity of the former means that when merged the green _METHOD_ was dominant in some cells . none of the thiolases were apparently targeted to mitochondria in vivo . however it is possible that uptake was prevented by the _METHOD_ fusion or that mitochondria normally take up less thiolase than _LOCATION_ such that _METHOD_ _METHOD_ from mitochondria did not reach an intensity to be detected . to test these possibilities we examined the ability of isolated mitochondria to take up all nine thiolases . each protein was synthesized in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation system in the presence of radiolabelled methionine and then tested for import into mitochondria isolated from arabidopsis cell cultures . as a control the import and processing of _PROTEIN_ and rubisco _PROTEIN_ were examined the former as a positive control for import and the latter as a control to demonstrate the specificity of import into isolated mitochondria . in this case the _PROTEIN_ precursor protein was imported and cleaved to a mature protein as previously demonstrated . addition of protease resulted in the kda mature form being resistant to protease digestion indicating uptake by mitochondria . this resistance was abolished by the addition of valinomycin that dissipates the inner _LOCATION_ potential . the phosphate translocator from maize was used as an additional control after uptake into mitochondria and rupture of the outer _LOCATION_ protease digestion results in a small cleaved protected fragment of kda indicating that the added protease has access to inside the outer _LOCATION_ . in contrast to the mitochondrial controls rubisco _PROTEIN_ was not protected from protease digestion indicating it was not imported into mitochondria . when the nine thiolase proteins were tested for mitochondrial uptake two distinct patterns were observed _PROTEIN_ acat acat acat _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ did not yield any protease protected products upon incubation with mitochondria and thus were deemed not to be imported . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ yielded resistant products upon incubation with mitochondria . although _PROTEIN_ was not proteolytically cleaved by mitochondria a protease resistant product with a lower mol _METHOD_ was obtained when mitochondria were treated with proteinase k . notably this was also generated in the presence of valinomycin . however upon rupture of the outer _LOCATION_ this product was absent . in the case of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ a similar pattern was observed except that the protected protein had the same molecular _METHOD_ as the protein added to the import assay . again with rupture of the outer _LOCATION_ no protease protection was observed . although the protease protected fragments produced upon incubation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may suggest uptake by mitochondria their presence when valinomycin was added to the import assay and their sensitivity when the outer mitochondrial _LOCATION_ is ruptured suggests that they may represent protease resistant products in the presence of intact mitochondria . the protease susceptibility of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was tested by the ability of added protease to digest the radiolabelled precursor protein . incubation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with proteinase k alone indicated that they were resistant to protease digestion in contrast _PROTEIN_ was completely digested . thus it was concluded that there was no uptake of any radiolabelled thiolase proteins into isolated mitochondria in agreement with the _METHOD_ targeting . the probable functions of these type i and type ii thiolases in their determined subcellular locations was examined by analysis of co _PROTEIN_ of these genes in microarray data from arabidopsis . we used the _PROTEIN_ angler co _PROTEIN_ correlation tool from the botany array resource to find the most co _PROTEIN_ genes based on microarray hybridization data on arabidopsis genechips the top co _PROTEIN_ genes are shown in each case . this analysis shows that _PROTEIN_ co _PROTEIN_ more highly with a range of peroxisomal fatty acid degradation components in the _LOCATION_ than with any other _LOCATION_ genes in arabidopsis . these included the fatty acid multifunction protein _METHOD_ citrate synthase acyl coa oxidases and enoyl coa hydratase . curiously _PROTEIN_ angler showed _PROTEIN_ is not co _PROTEIN_ with oxidation enzymes but instead with a series of flavonoid biosynthesis enzymes including flavanone hydroxylase courmarate coa ligase _PROTEIN_ synthase _PROTEIN_ isomerase . notably this pathway requires short acyl coas for biosynthesis . the gene encoding a type ii enzyme _PROTEIN_ was found by _PROTEIN_ angler to be co _PROTEIN_ with a range of genes but notably hydroxymethylglutaryl coa synthase and mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase were highly co _PROTEIN_ . this is consistent with the role of type ii genes in the _LOCATION_ mevalonate pathway leading to isoprene containing compounds such as sterols and terpenoids . the isoleucine catabolism pathway involves the branched chain amino acid dehydrogenase complex isovaleryl coa dehydrogenase enoyl coa hydratase in mitochondria and then hydroxy methylbutyryl coa dehydrogenases and the fatty acid multifunction proteins in addition to a thiolase but these fore mentioned genes do not appear to be co _PROTEIN_ with any of the thiolase genes . to confirm the co _PROTEIN_ groups in fig . we used genevestigator to cluster _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and their cohort of highlighted co _PROTEIN_ genes across a series of microarray data based on tissue specific _PROTEIN_ . this bootstrapped cluster tree showed three separate groupings of genes confirming the _PROTEIN_ angler analysis of distinct _PROTEIN_ patterns of these three thiolases correlating with distinct roles in metabolism . note this type of _PROTEIN_ analysis can not distinguish differential roles for _METHOD_ of proteins resulting from alternative splicing as the probe sets used to determine _PROTEIN_ do not distinguish between splice _METHOD_ .
the predicted protein sequence encoded by _GENE_ previously shown to be a thiolase was used to define other thiolase encoding genes in arabidopsis and the sequences from other species as previously published . a similarity tree was made using clustalw multiple sequence alignment and neighbour joining . the gene structures were obtained from the arabidopsis information resource annotation version and three individual cdnas were amplified for all possible cdnas . the cdnas produced from the genes were defined using the arabidopsis genome tiling array . targeting predictions of the encoded proteins were carried out using a variety of prediction _METHOD_ targetp mitoprot subloc ipsort predotar mitpred and peroxp . percentage identity and similarity was calculated using matgap . the coding sequences of the predicted thiolase proteins were cloned in frame with the coding region of _METHOD_ in pgem containing the camv promoter . the alternative oxidase _PROTEIN_ coding region fused to _METHOD_ and the red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fused to a type peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ targeting signal from pumpkin were used as mitochondrial and peroxisomal controls respectively . the constructs were used to transform arabidopsis suspension culture cells by biolistic transformation as previously outlined . _METHOD_ patterns were obtained h after transformation by visualization under an olympus _METHOD_ microscope and imaged using the cellr imaging software . in vitro protein import assays into mitochondria isolated from arabidopsis suspension cell cultures were carried out as described in lister et al . . in vitro mitochondrial uptake assays were performed by adding precursor protein to of isolated mitochondria in in the presence of respiratory substrate and _PROTEIN_ and adp in import buffer bsa mm mm methionine and mm dtt . reactions were incubated at for min then divided into two equal aliquots and placed on ice . to one aliquot proteinase k was added to a final concentration of and incubated for min on ice followed by the addition of _METHOD_ to mm to terminate protease digestion . the mitochondria were pelleted washed twice in ice cold import buffer . the final pellet was resuspended in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ sample buffer and proteins separated in polyacrylamide gels then dried . radiolabelled proteins were visualized by exposing to a _PROTEIN_ imaging plate for h and reading on a _PROTEIN_ bio imaging analyser . outer _LOCATION_ ruptured mitochondria were prepared after the import assay to test for the intraorganelle location of imported protein . rupture of the outer _LOCATION_ allowed access of added protease to intermembrane space components or inner _LOCATION_ proteins exposed to the intermembrane space . mit om were prepared by resuspending of mitochondrial protein in ml _PROTEIN_ buffer and then adding of mm hepes ph and incubating on ice for min . to restore osmolarity of m sucrose and of m kcl was added and mixed re pelleted and washed in import buffer . valinomycin was added to a final concentration of where indicated prior to the addition of the precursor protein to mitochondria and commencement of the import assay . _PROTEIN_ was used as a positive control and the small subunit of ribulose bisphosphate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as a negative control . as some precursor proteins displayed protease insensitivity even in the presence of valinomycin the sensitivity of the precursor proteins alone to added protease was tested . sensitivity of the in vitro synthesized radiolabelled proteins was tested by adding proteinase k to the synthesized protein alone in the absence of mitochondria to ensure that the added protease could digest the protein . _PROTEIN_ correlation for genes encoding kats and acats was performed using the _PROTEIN_ angler program on the botany array resource . the genevestigator arabidopsis microarray database was used to analyse the response of the genes of interest in this study in a variety of tissue types . the meta analyser tool was the function utilized _PROTEIN_ array wild type only arrays were chosen and the genes of interest were selected . the data was visualized using a linear scale from a total of array experiments . tmev programme was used to cluster the genes and stresses and euclidean distance and complete linkage were chosen for the hierarchal clustering .
