arabinogalactan proteins _PROTEIN_ are a family of highly glycosylated hydroxyproline rich glycoproteins . _PROTEIN_ and comprise the lysine rich classical _PROTEIN_ subfamily in arabidopsis . overexpression of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins in arabidopsis revealed localization of the fusion proteins on the plant cell surface of different organs . subcellular localization of the fusion proteins at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was further determined by plasmolysis of leaf trichome cells . to elucidate _PROTEIN_ function these _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ without the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tag under the control of cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . in contrast to _PROTEIN_ overexpressors which showed phenotypes identical to wild type plants _PROTEIN_ overexpressors displayed several phenotypes distinct from wild type plants . specifically these overexpressors had smaller rosettes and shorter _METHOD_ and roots produced more branches and had less viable seeds . moreover these _PROTEIN_ overexpressors exhibited similar phenotypes to tomato leagp overexpressors suggesting these two _PROTEIN_ genes may have similar function in arabidopsis and tomato .
rt pcr results showed _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in seedlings flowers _METHOD_ and rosette leaves and weakly _PROTEIN_ in roots . these results are in agreement with previous northern blot analyses from our lab and are also consistent with the microarray data from genevestigator . surprisingly western blotting with _PROTEIN_ antiserum shows that _PROTEIN_ is highly _PROTEIN_ in roots and flowers moderately _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ and weakly _PROTEIN_ in siliques and leaves . this finding demonstrates that the mrna _PROTEIN_ level is not always consistent with the level of protein _PROTEIN_ . in order to examine _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ at the tissue level a p _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ construct was made and introduced into arabidopsis wild type plants . the promoter sequence used in this construct included kb of dna upstream of the start codon since a previous study showed kb of this promoter region was insufficient to drive the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . transgenic p _PROTEIN_ gus lines were identified by pcr however gus staining was not detected in the transgenic lines in various organs while gus staining of positive controls _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed distinct staining patterns consistent with previous published data indicating this kb promoter region was not able to drive _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the ss _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ overexpression constructs were transferred into arabidopsis wild type plants by floral dip transformation . for convenience transgenic plants were named over over and over respectively . rt pcr was performed to examine _PROTEIN_ mrna _PROTEIN_ levels in the transgenic plants . _PROTEIN_ mrnas in the transgenic plants were from both the endogenous gene and the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgene . as a result the rt pcr product of _PROTEIN_ mrna from the transformants was considerably more than that from wild type . to verify the presence of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein western blotting was carried out using _METHOD_ antibody . protein samples were boiled for min prior to loading to release the _METHOD_ from the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein since a previous study showed heating releases the _METHOD_ from the fusion protein . as fig . shows _METHOD_ was present in over but was absent in wt . green _METHOD_ was also observed in different transgenic lines indicating _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins were localized to the cell surface in different plant organs including root leaf stem and flower . to examine the subcellular localization of some of these _METHOD_ fusion proteins leaf trichome cells of over and over were plasmolyzed and enhanced _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ however no hechtian strands were observed . to overexpress _PROTEIN_ without the _METHOD_ tag the _PROTEIN_ constructs as well as a vector control were transformed into arabidopsis wild type plants . for convenience the transformants were named _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and vc respectively . ten lines and lines were identified by pcr and their rna _PROTEIN_ levels were determined . phenotypes of these lines however were not different from wild type plants with respect to plant height branch number and reproduction . there was only one line which was smaller and shorter compared with the wild type plants . this might be due to the disruption of some important genes by random insertion of the transgene . thirty two lines were identified to contain the _PROTEIN_ construct . among these lines lines displayed several phenotypes distinct from wild type and vector control plants . furthermore rna was extracted from day old cauline leaves of individual plants and rt pcr was performed to monitor _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the lines had high _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ while the vc lines had low _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as did wild type plants . the various phenotypes of lines are discussed below . the differences between lines and the wild type plants were not dramatic during the first weeks after germination . during the week and _PROTEIN_ when the wild type plants developed long inflorescence _METHOD_ plants developed multiple short branches from the rosette . the length of these _METHOD_ was usually less than one fifth of the wild type stem and the branching number was usually more than twice that of the wild type resulting in multiple flower buds crowded near the rosette . moreover the rosette of plants was smaller than that of the wild type and some rosette leaves showed an epinastic phenotype . the reproductive system in plants was also affected . although plants had the same flowering time as wild type plants they usually produced smaller and sterile siliques . as a result most of the lines were sterile and even the partially fertile lines still had less seeds than the wild type . when flowers were dissected some flowers from plants were found to have short stamens that presumably could not function normally . the lines also had shorter primary roots and less _PROTEIN_ roots than the wild type and vc lines . these plants without the normal root system might have difficulty obtaining water and nutrients from the soil and as a result some lines died weeks after germination . microarray data of hormone treated plants from the tair website showed that aba down regulated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in order to test the validity of this microarray data an rt pcr experiment was designed . specifically and day old seedlings were treated with aba before isolating rna for rt pcr to monitor _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . it was determined that this aba treatment resulted in yellowing of the seedlings and a marked reduction in _PROTEIN_ mrna levels consistent with the microarray data .
