a reverse genetics approach was used to evaluate the function of the two orthologs of with the highest levels of _PROTEIN_ in pollen _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the two proteins differ mostly in the presence of a _PROTEIN_ domain in _PROTEIN_ and its absence in _PROTEIN_ . by screening the salk institute genomic analysis laboratory collection for insertion mutants we retrieved one insertion in the _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ and one insertion in the _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ . dna sequencing of the regions adjacent to the left border confirmed that in _PROTEIN_ the insertion was found to disrupt the coding sequence in the ninth exon downstream of the initiation codon . similarly in _PROTEIN_ the insertion was found to disrupt the coding sequence in the exon . analysis of homozygous mutant lines showed a null _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ confirming that the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ homozygous mutant plants are knockout mutants . these plants when fully grown did not exhibit significant morphological phenotypes when compared with the plants . similarly the pollen grains from _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ homozygous flowers were found to be indistinguishable from pollen in shape and size . aniline blue and neutral red staining showed no abnormalities in the cytoplasm or wall of the pollen grains and correctly differentiated vegetative and sperm cell _LOCATION_ . in vivo the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ pollen grains were able to grow in the stigma and style . we pistils with pollen from or homozygous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants and stained them with aniline blue or h after pollination . eight hours after pollination we observed that most pollen grains had germinated and that pollen tubes had crossed the stigma style and reached the ovary . sixteen hours after pollination the pollen tubes had reached the base of the transmitting tract . pollen was also able to germinate in the female transmitting tracts of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ homozygous flowers . to obtain additional insights into _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ phenotypes a comparison of silique length seed count incidence of seed gaps and incidence of deformed seeds was performed . data showed statistically differences between mutant and plants . these results show that under optimal growth conditions single _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations do not result in significant impairment of pollen fitness and competitiveness in vivo . to test the hypothesis of complementary functionality in _PROTEIN_ genes double mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were generated from reciprocal crosses of both single mutant lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the resulting plants were allowed to and the progeny was screened by pcr for the presence of double homozygous mutants . of plants that were screened three double mutants were detected . after pearson 's test this result is not significantly different from the mendelian segregation ratio and so no transmission defects are assumed . similar to the single mutant lines the double mutant plants developed to maturity with no severe vegetative morphological defects . in order to obtain more double mutants bbdd and bbdd plants from were allowed to set self seed . plants were screened by pcr to determine their genotype and four double mutants were recovered . after pearson 's test this result is not significantly different from the mendelian segregation ratio and again no transmission effects are assumed . the pollen grains from double mutant plants did not differ from single mutant pollen in _METHOD_ of shape and size and were able to germinate and develop pollen tubes in vitro . the genetic data referred to above were obtained when plants were grown under optimized and fully controlled biotic and abiotic conditions . this is likely to mask minor disadvantages which under normal conditions could result in _PROTEIN_ mutant male gametophytic competitiveness . to test this hypothesis we performed a series of morphological analyses on pollen tube growth in vitro that is in culture medium which is known to fall short of mimicking the in vivo conditions . the germination percentage of pollen grains from _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ homozygous flowers was found to be statistically indistinguishable from pollen but pollen from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ flowers revealed a lower and variable germination capacity suggesting that the effect of the two genes is additive . furthermore under similar growth conditions the germinated _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes revealed a higher but statistically growth rate which prompted us to undertake a more detailed morphological analysis of individual phenotypes . as reported previously in pollen the frequency of abnormal morphologies _PROTEIN_ was found to be and again we found differences in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes when looking at this parameter . however h after germination mutant cells exhibited a significantly higher frequency of transient perturbation in tip growth as evidenced by measurements of apical tip diameter . twelve or more hours after germination _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes when compared with the exhibited a higher frequency of abnormal morphologies apical bursting and total growth arrest . interestingly h after germination _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes exhibited not only abnormal morphologies but a high degree of plasmolysis indicative of an osmoregulation problem . these observations are consistent with a defect in _LOCATION_ dynamics/recycling and support an important role of _PROTEIN_ proteins in pollen germination and tip growth as suggested previously . to test whether _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes show perturbations in _LOCATION_ secretion and recycling cells were loaded with the _METHOD_ probe a dye useful for exploring the and exocytosis _METHOD_ . confocal imaging of growing arabidopsis and mutant pollen tubes labeled with for min revealed a _METHOD_ pattern similar to previous reports with a stronger signal in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and in the apical zone . mutant cells however exhibited a lower _METHOD_ intensity suggesting a reduced rate of _LOCATION_ recycling . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was identical in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant cells . intracellularly the reduction was higher in _PROTEIN_ cells suggesting that the two genotypes differ mostly from each other in the amount of internalized dye which could reflect different subcellular localizations . to assess possible changes in _LOCATION_ ph we used the _LOCATION_ acridine orange a neutral dye which on protonation exhibits a bathochromic shift in its _METHOD_ emission . thus an increase in _METHOD_ emitted in the range vs light emitted at nm can be used as a relative measure of acidification . control conditions involved exposure of pollen tubes to _LOCATION_ acidic ph . using this ratio procedure we found that _PROTEIN_ cells exhibited lower _METHOD_ shifting than cells suggesting an impaired capacity for _LOCATION_ acidification . by analogy with measurements _PROTEIN_ cells exhibited lower _METHOD_ shifting . in both cases collection of data in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen revealed additive effects . however the significance of these data is compromised by the fragility of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tubes germinating in vitro . osmotic changes have been related to ptdins levels changes in endocytosis and the production of ros . considering the plasmolysis observation made in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes and the importance of ros in tip growth we used the dye to test whether their production was also altered in _PROTEIN_ mutants . the staining in arabidopsis pollen tubes was similar to that reported previously for tobacco and papaver with a higher signal in the regions near the apex and bright structures . as control condition cells were with mm for min . such treatment resulted in increased and uniform _METHOD_ as observed for tobacco under similar _METHOD_ . similar to measurements _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes exhibited lower _METHOD_ intensity with a greater reduction in _PROTEIN_ cells . collection of data in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen again revealed additive effects but the fragility of the double mutant cells recommends a critical interpretation of the data . the stable transformation of arabidopsis with pollen _METHOD_ constructs resulted in weak _METHOD_ emissions and difficulties in performing live imaging over long time periods . furthermore these cells grow slowly and are very sensitive to laser irradiation preventing the appropriate collection of series to confidently establish the localization of _PROTEIN_ proteins . as an alternative we transiently transformed nicotiana tabacum pollen with _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ constructs the cdnas were cloned downstream of the promoter . this strategy has already been successful in previous works . tobacco pollen is easily transformed using biolistics the tubes grow faster than those from arabidopsis and they are larger and more tolerant to the laser irradiation required for imaging . in addition images were collected with a laser power and care was taken to ensure a medial section through the pollen tubes . the subcellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein was investigated using a _METHOD_ fusion construct containing the complete open reading frame of the _PROTEIN_ gene . actively growing cells were observed c. h after transformation when the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ levels are sufficiently strong for appropriate imaging with laser irradiation before this period the _METHOD_ signal was hardly visible possibly as a result of the high molecular weight of _PROTEIN_ and lower diffusion to the target location . _METHOD_ was found to exhibit mostly a reticulate distribution more intense at the _LOCATION_ and subapical region a distribution resembling _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _METHOD_ was also found to decorate the tonoplast in older regions of the tube . this distribution is distinct from that observed for intrinsic protein which revealed a punctuate pattern . is known to localize at the tonoplast of lytic _LOCATION_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ localizes at a different _LOCATION_ pool _LOCATION_ . this is consistent with a reticulate _METHOD_ signal and a protein role in _LOCATION_ reorganization and endocytosis _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ localization was similarly achieved using a _METHOD_ fusion construct containing the open reading frame of the _PROTEIN_ gene . observations made h after transformation revealed a mostly _LOCATION_ localization of _METHOD_ protein in accordance with the absence of a _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ domain . however a stronger _METHOD_ signal could be observed at the generative and sperm cells particularly before or at early germination stages . such a pattern of localization is in agreement with _PROTEIN_ data and further supports the hypothesis of a complementary functionality in _PROTEIN_ genes .
