heat shock protein is an abundant and highly conserved molecular chaperone . in arabidopsis the gene family consists of seven members . here we report that the gene gives rise to two mrna populations termed and due to alternative initiation of transcription . the and transcription start sites are located nucleotides upstream and nucleotides downstream of the annotated translation start site respectively . both transcripts are detected under normal or heat shock conditions . the inducibility of mrnas by heat shock implies a potential role of both _METHOD_ in stress management . stable transformation experiments with fusion constructs between the n terminal part of each isoform and green _METHOD_ protein indicated import of both fusion proteins into mitochondria . in planta investigation confirmed that fusion of the n terminus to green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ did result in specific chloroplastic localization . the _METHOD_ of regulation for mitochondria and _LOCATION_ localized chaperone encoding genes are not well understood . future work is needed to address the possible roles of harsh environmental conditions and developmental processes on fine tuning and compartmentalization of the and proteins in arabidopsis .
the full length protein of the arabidopsis thaliana is reported in the ncbi database to contain amino acid residues . however the open reading frame of the corresponding cdna contains four in frame translation initiation codons at the n terminal region . therefore the cdna could potentially encode for proteins starting at any initiation codon . the consensus sequence for translational initiation is defined as gcca/gccaugg/a with positions and being the most critical . inspection of the genomic sequence of revealed that the first two augs are located within a sequence context matching the demand of kozak s rule . in contrast aug and aug are located within a poor kozak configuration to be considered as initiation codons . these observations led us to investigate whether could be a multifunctional gene coding for various _METHOD_ of by alternative use of transcription/translation initiation codons . primer extension analysis was performed to determine the potential transcription initiation sites of . the results indicated that two major transcript ends can be detected in a. thaliana one mapping nucleotides upstream of the first translation start site and one mapping nucleotides upstream of the second translation start site . consequently it is very likely that the gene has multiple transcriptional start sites . the first exon of the longer transcript is identical to that deposited in the arabidopsis genome database . the _PROTEIN_ start codon of the shorter transcript is located within the second exon of the . the region of the sequence contains a predicted intron of bp . the dna sequence conservation rule near the exon intron boundaries is fulfilled with _PROTEIN_ located at the initiation and _PROTEIN_ at the termination sites of the intron respectively . to corroborate the presence of two different mrna populations corresponding to and rt pcr analysis was performed using forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers specific for the utr intron exon and exon as shown in fig . . dna fragments of different sizes were amplified and the two transcript populations were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing of the rt pcr products . the corresponding cdnas did not contain any intron sequences . as anticipated no amplification products were obtained using primer combinations and while the primer combination produced the predicted fragment . since both and primers are located within the first intron and the latter covers the determined initiation of transcription the existence of the smaller mrna is expected . to rule out the possibility that the pcr products originated from contaminating genomic dna additional rt pcr reactions were performed . reverse primer together with the sense primers or did not produce any amplification fragments . sequencing of both cdnas deriving from the long and short transcripts showed that they were identical except for the ends . we therefore concluded that produces at least two different mrnas encoding and proteins . it should be noted that the gene in the ncbi database possesses exons . however a careful comparison of the genomic sequence to the cdna sequences obtained in the course of the present study revealed that consists of exons . this _LOCATION_ is due to a misannotation of the intron/exon boundaries for exons and . in silico analysis of the kb region upstream of the gene transcription start sites revealed the presence of a heat shock element _PROTEIN_ consisting of three perfect and one imperfect core units . two ccaat sequences were identified near the putative _PROTEIN_ . it has been reported that ccaat box sequences _PROTEIN_ act cooperatively with _PROTEIN_ . interestingly no perfect _PROTEIN_ boxes were identified . further inspection of the promoter region revealed the presence of potential binding sites for various transcription _PROTEIN_ including activating enhancer protein mitochondrial stress response element _METHOD_ and stress response element _PROTEIN_ . these cis elements play important roles in regulating _PROTEIN_ of genes in response to heat shock heavy metal dehydration low temperature light and pathogen elicitors . however the biological significance of the putative elements within the promoter region of the remains to be verified experimentally . since our results suggested that the annotated met codon might not serve as the only site for the initiation of translation we investigated whether this met codon was dispensable for translation of the gene . given that every _PROTEIN_ codon is not necessarily used for translation initiation we attempted to translate in vitro the two coding sequences . open reading frames encoding or amino acids of the or cdna respectively were cloned into the pgem vector and the resulting polypeptide products were methionine labeled in a tnt coupled reticulocyte lysate system . as shown in fig . two translation products of or kda were produced from the long or the short template respectively . these results suggested that both _PROTEIN_ are suited for translation initiation as predicted by the presence of typical kozak sequences . we therefore propose that the _METHOD_ were not generated by alternative splicing but resulted from the utilization of alternative transcription initiation sites . the majority of _LOCATION_ encoded organellar proteins are translated by _LOCATION_ ribosomes and directed to the appropriate organelle by the n terminal signal peptides . sequence comparison between members of the protein family revealed that and contain a highly variable n terminal region composed of amino acids . in the case of the targeting peptide is predicted to be amino acids long as determined by in silico analysis . the intracellular prediction program targetp indicated that could be localized to both mitochondria and chloroplasts whereas predotar predicted only mitochondrial localization . interestingly in the case of in silico protein targeting analysis indicated that the translation initiation at the aug start codon did not contain any organelle target sequence . to determine the intracellular targeting of and proteins in planta _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ reporter constructs were used for arabidopsis transformation . arabidopsis transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ the fusion proteins were established and analyzed by _METHOD_ microscopy . both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusion proteins were detected in numerous spherical bodies of root hair cells . staining with the mitochondria specific dye mitotracker orange revealed co localization with the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signals confirming that _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusion proteins were delivered into mitochondria . in control plants only red and no green _METHOD_ was detected . to investigate whether any of the two fusion proteins had a dual targeting to both mitochondria and chloroplasts isolated arabidopsis leaf protoplasts were analyzed . using the _METHOD_ of chlorophyll as a marker it was clear that the _METHOD_ signal did not co localize with the red chlorophyll _METHOD_ . the above results indicate that the n terminal sequences present in _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ include a mitochondrial targeting sequence that is necessary and sufficient to transport the fusion proteins into mitochondria . there are many and varied ways by which cross compartment targeting is achieved by _LOCATION_ encoded organellar proteins including n terminal and internal signal sequences . computer assisted analysis for localization signals predicted that the protein has a amino acid transit peptide . the intracellular prediction program targetp indicated that the could be localized to both chloroplasts and mitochondria while predotar predicted only chloroplastic localization . to independently verify the _LOCATION_ localization of in planta a _METHOD_ fusion construct was used to generate stably transgenic arabidopsis plants . targeting of the encoded fusion protein was monitored using _METHOD_ microscopy presented in fig . . the green _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ clearly co localized with the red _METHOD_ of chlorophyll demonstrating that the protein was efficiently targeted to chloroplasts . to investigate whether the fusion protein was also targeted to mitochondria arabidopsis root cells were analyzed . using mitotracker as a _METHOD_ marker for mitochondria it was clear that the detected _METHOD_ signal in _LOCATION_ of root cells did not overlap with the red mitotracker _METHOD_ signal . in transgenic lines harboring the _METHOD_ control construct _METHOD_ the _METHOD_ was observed in the cytoplasm corroborating the principally _LOCATION_ localization reported for wild type _METHOD_ . in order to investigate how the abundance of and was regulated under control or heat stress conditions we determined the levels of the corresponding transcripts using semiquantitative rt pcr on rna isolated from day old plants . mrna levels were also monitored . whereas a strong gapdh derived band was observed neither nor derived transcript was detectable after cycles of pcr . after cycles of pcr amplification mrna was detected under heat stress conditions whereas after cycles both and mrnas were amplified under control or heat shock conditions . the results indicate that the _PROTEIN_ profile of both transcript _METHOD_ is similar however was _PROTEIN_ at higher levels under the conditions tested . _PROTEIN_ levels were low under control or heat shock conditions . as shown previously mrna levels were almost undetectable in mature plants suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ of is developmentally regulated . to determine whether the _PROTEIN_ pattern of the fused genes in the transgenes harboring the constructs _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ resembled that of the corresponding endogenous mrna levels rt pcr analysis was performed . twenty eight day old transgenic arabidopsis plants harboring a single transgene copy were exposed to for or h. rna was reverse transcribed from a pool of ten independent transgenic lines and the _PROTEIN_ profiles of the and were determined . transcription patterns of the _METHOD_ gene constructs and the corresponding endogenous genes were similar for both _METHOD_ transgenes and wild type plants . however in transgenic plants the _METHOD_ fusion transcript levels were higher than the endogenous under heat shock conditions suggesting a stronger interaction of the promoter to hsfs and/or a difference in mrna stability .
