arabidopsis contains only one functional dihydroflavonol _PROTEIN_ gene but several _PROTEIN_ genes encoding proteins with the conserved nad h binding domain . _GENE_ named _PROTEIN_ is a closely related homolog of the rice gene reported previously . two mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were found to have impaired pollen formation and seed production . histological analysis revealed defective microspore development after tetrad release in both mutants . microspore walls were found to rupture releasing the protoplasts which eventually degenerated . the _PROTEIN_ promoter is in closed flower buds . analysis in transgenic arabidopsis revealed _PROTEIN_ in tapetum tetrads and developing microspores but not in mature anthers . enhanced yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ analysis demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ is a soluble _LOCATION_ protein that may also be localized in the _LOCATION_ . restoration of male fertility and seed formation was only achieved by a native construct but not by a construct demonstrating the importance of spatial and temporal specificities of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ may be involved in a novel metabolic pathway essential for pollen wall development . _PROTEIN_ homologs were identified as and _PROTEIN_ sequence tags from different species suggesting that _PROTEIN_ may have a conserved functional role in male fertility in flowering plants .
_PROTEIN_ contains six exons and five introns and an open reading frame of bp encoding a protein with amino acids . we have obtained two independent insertion mutants for _PROTEIN_ . in _PROTEIN_ the insertion occurred at bp upstream of the predicted stop codon while in _PROTEIN_ the insertion was found within intron . the mutants were indistinguishable from wild type in the heterozygous state and hence the mutation alleles are both recessive . on the other hand homozygous lines for the two insertion mutants showed different degrees of male sterility . flowers of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ homozygous plants are of normal size and shape and filaments of stamens elongate as in the wild type . however no pollen grains were found on the surfaces of anthers and stigma in the mutant flowers . most mature anthers of _PROTEIN_ homozygous plants were empty although some had a little pollen which stained purple with alexander 's stain indicating that they are viable . however the _PROTEIN_ pollen appeared irregular in shape and less intact compared with the pollen . consequently the _PROTEIN_ plants displayed a partial fertility phenotype with small number of seeded siliques . on the other hand mature anthers of _PROTEIN_ homozygous plants were completely devoid of pollen and the mutant plants showed undeveloped siliques without seed formation . hence the _PROTEIN_ homozygous mutants are completely sterile and this mutation allele could only be propagated in the heterozygous state . of the _PROTEIN_ mutant stigmas with pollen grains resulted in normal seed fertility indicating that the female reproductive tissues were functional in the homozygous plants . anther dehiscence was normal in both mutant alleles suggesting that defects in pollen development were the major cause of male sterility . flowers of different stages from and mutant plants were fixed embedded and sectioned for histological examination of reproductive development . in anthers meiotic division proceeded normally with the formation of microspore tetrads . the microspores then started to expand and separated from one another with a distinct cell wall . afterwards they continued to increase in size and the cell walls _PROTEIN_ . as development progressed large _LOCATION_ and sculptured exine walls were readily observed in the microspores . microgametogenesis then began as prominent starch granules accumulated in the microspore cytoplasm . in the mature pollen grains during the time of dehiscence the generative cell was embedded within the tube cell and the tapetum was completely degenerated . in the _PROTEIN_ homozygous mutants the initial anther development was normal up to the completion of meiosis with the formation of microspore tetrads . although the microspores rounded up and separated from one another they remained small . moreover a distinct sculptured cell wall was absent in these microspores . as development progressed the walls began to rupture releasing the protoplasts into the anther locules . the protoplasts then increased in size with the accumulation of starch granules and gradually occupied the entire space of the anther locules . as the flowers matured the protoplasts degenerated rapidly leaving remnants of cytoplasm and starch granules . similar to the wild type the mutant tapetum remained intact during the course of anther development and it became degenerated in the mature anthers . pollen development in the _PROTEIN_ mutant was essentially the same as it was observed in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . however some _PROTEIN_ mature anther locules were found to contain a few pollen grains which apparently resulted in the partial fertility phenotype in the mutant plants . it is important to note that embryo sac sections from both mutant flowers appeared normal further confirming that the female reproductive functions were not affected by the _PROTEIN_ mutations . to better understand the physiological function of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis experiments were conducted with rna samples prepared from different tissues in plants . transcripts of _PROTEIN_ were not detected in seedlings cauline leaves or inflorescence stalk but only in a mixture of young and mature flowers indicating that the gene _PROTEIN_ is specific in reproductive tissues . a null mutation in _PROTEIN_ was expected in the _PROTEIN_ mutant as the insertion occurred in the middle of the gene . on the other hand the reduced fertility phenotype of _PROTEIN_ mutant suggested that _PROTEIN_ may be partially functional in the plant . _PROTEIN_ experiments were performed to map the of the _PROTEIN_ transcript which was found to be polyadenylated and chimeric containing the endogenous _PROTEIN_ sequence up to the insertion site followed by sequence derived from the left border of the . the _PROTEIN_ encodes a protein of amino acids in length . the predicted _PROTEIN_ mutant protein would be truncated at the amino acid with a extension of amino acids derived from the sequence . the truncation might have reduced the stability and enzyme activity of the mutant protein . spatial and temporal _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was examined in transgenic plants carrying the gus reporter gene driven by a kb upstream region of the putative _PROTEIN_ promoter . we have analyzed > independent lines and the _PROTEIN_ patterns were found to be consistent . staining of whole plants from the transgenic lines demonstrated that gus activities were not present in vegetative tissues . consistent with the results gus activities were detected only in floral tissues but were restricted to anthers . anther staining was first visualized in c. mm buds and was intensified as the buds increased in size . gus _PROTEIN_ in anthers gradually declined as the flowers were maturing and no anther staining was detected in fully open flowers . isolated anthers from young buds revealed gus activities in the developing microspores and the tapetal region . histological investigations of stained anther sections demonstrated that gus activities were strongly _PROTEIN_ in both tapetum and developing microspores . staining was first observed at the tetrad stage and became intensified during microspore release . gus activities started to decline as development progressed while staining could still be detected in the maturing pollen grains and the tapetal cells . subsequently no staining was found in mature anther and pollen grains . to conclusively define the role of _PROTEIN_ in male fertility two complementation constructs in a plant binary vector were generated and transformed into the completely sterile _PROTEIN_ mutant . in one construct the _PROTEIN_ coding region was driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . in another construct the coding region was driven by the kb upstream putative promoter sequence . the binary vectors were transformed individually to _PROTEIN_ heterozygous plants using a. tumefaciens . transformants were selected on hygromycin medium and homozygous lines _PROTEIN_ were identified by pcr . restoration of normal pollen development silique elongation and seed formation was achieved in all the transgenic homozygous lines carrying the native promoter construct but not the promoter construct . these results demonstrated conclusively that the _PROTEIN_ is indispensable for male fertility in arabidopsis . furthermore and _PROTEIN_ driven by the native promoter is essential for _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ its normal physiological functions . to investigate the cellular localization of _PROTEIN_ a translational fusion of _PROTEIN_ upstream to _METHOD_ driven by the promoter was generated . the fusion construct was then introduced to onion epidermal cells by particle bombardment . as shown in fig . _METHOD_ signals were detected throughout the whole onion cells including the _LOCATION_ . plasmolysis treatments resulted in _METHOD_ signals contained in the shrinking cytoplasm . the same localization patterns were observed for an _METHOD_ control construct . accumulation of _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ is expected to occur by passive diffusion . however the _METHOD_ fusion is slightly larger than the limit in the _LOCATION_ pore complexes suggesting that _PROTEIN_ may also be localized in the _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ shows weak sequence identity to other _PROTEIN_ family proteins in arabidopsis to _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ and to _PROTEIN_ . by contrast a number of _PROTEIN_ homologs from different plants with sequence identity between to to _PROTEIN_ were identified in the _PROTEIN_ plant gene indices by tblastn searches . interestingly these sequences were exclusively derived from cdna libraries of floral tissues such as anthers pollen immature flowers or inflorescence _PROTEIN_ . phylogenetic analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ clustered with the _PROTEIN_ homologs instead of the other arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ proteins suggesting a distinct functional role of _PROTEIN_ in plants . _PROTEIN_ and the dicot sequences form a separate clade within the group of conserved _PROTEIN_ homologs while the cereal sequences were clustered in another clade . alignment of the translated proteins of the different cdnas with _PROTEIN_ revealed the putative nad domain and the high degree of homology throughout their entire sequences . the region is believed to be involved in the binding site of nad metabolic enzymes .
arabidopsis thaliana heynh . accession columbia was used as the control in this study . _PROTEIN_ insertion lines were obtained from the french national institute for agricultural research _PROTEIN_ and the arabidopsis biological resource center _PROTEIN_ . seeds were germinated in the dark for d at . all plants were grown on soil and kept under conditions at in growth chambers . pcr genotyping was used to identify homozygous insertion lines . for _PROTEIN_ mutant lp primer and rp primer and lb primer were used . for _PROTEIN_ mutant lp primer and rp primer and lb primer were used . for homozygous mutants only lb and rp primers resulted in a pcr product . for plants only the primers resulted in a pcr product . for heterozygous plants pcr reactions were positive for both combinations of primer sets . pcr amplifications were programmed as follows followed by cycles of denaturation annealing and extension followed by a final extension step at for min . the precise insertion sites in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were determined by sequencing the pcr products . anthers were removed from flowers and mounted in a drop of alexander 's stain under a cover glass to study the abundance of pollen grains . for histological examinations flower buds of different stages were fixed in glutaraldehyde and paraformaldehyde buffered with m phosphate buffer for h at . after fixation the flowers were dehydrated using an ethanol series and embedded in historesin as described previously . serial sections of _PROTEIN_ were sliced using a microtome and stained with periodic _PROTEIN_ reaction for total _PROTEIN_ and counterstained with amido black for proteins or toluidine blue o for general histological organization followed by examination under a leitz photomicroscope . in order to confirm the nature of the _PROTEIN_ granules the starch staining method detailed by et al . was also used . total rna was extracted from different organs by the trizol method . rna samples were and by reverse transcriptase . primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were used for amplification of _PROTEIN_ while primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were used for amplification of an actin gene . the end of the _PROTEIN_ allele was mapped by a rapid amplification of cdna ends _PROTEIN_ procedure as described by the manufacturer followed by dna sequencing . cdna was amplified by pcr using a primer upstream of the insertion site and an _PROTEIN_ primer _PROTEIN_ . the pcr amplification program was the same as described earlier . a kb region upstream of the _PROTEIN_ initiation codon was amplified from genomic dna using the primers and . following sequence confirmation the pcr fragment was used to construct a _PROTEIN_ fusion gene in a binary vector . plants were transformed with the agrobacterium tumefaciens strain harboring the fusion gene construct using the floral dip method . transformants were selected on _METHOD_ plates containing hygromycin and seeds were germinated for gus _PROTEIN_ analysis . different tissues collected from plants were incubated with _PROTEIN_ in mm phosphate buffer triton and mm ferrocyanide for h. gus staining patterns were recorded using a leica stereomicroscope equipped with a leica _PROTEIN_ digital camera . for histological examinations the stained flowers were fixed and processed as detailed earlier after the staining . the stained sections were examined without an applied cover glass in order to visualize the blue staining product . the _PROTEIN_ coding region was cloned in frame with an enhanced yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ gene under the control of the promoter in a binary vector to generate the fusion construct _METHOD_ . the _PROTEIN_ coding region was amplified with the primers _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ using a cdna clone obtained from the _PROTEIN_ bioresource center as the template . particle bombardment was used to introduce the fusion plasmid into onion epidermal cells by a biolistic _PROTEIN_ system . gold particles were coated with the plasmid and a helium pressure of psi was employed . about of gold particles were coated with dna in one bombardment . the target distance between the stop screen and onion scales was _PROTEIN_ at cm . the bombarded samples were kept in darkness at for h and subsequently examined under the leica stereomicroscope . to induce plasmolysis a layer of onion epidermal cells was removed from the bombarded scales and incubated in m sucrose solution for min . a kpn i/sal i fragment containing the _PROTEIN_ coding region was released from the cdna clone . the dna fragment was inserted between the camv promoter and the nopaline synthase in a binary vector . to generate the native promoter complementation construct the promoter region was replaced by the kb upstream _PROTEIN_ genomic fragment . the two complementation constructs were transformed independently into heterozygous _PROTEIN_ insertion lines by the floral dip method as described earlier .
