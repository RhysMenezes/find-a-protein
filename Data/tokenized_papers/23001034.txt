after transcription mrna editing in angiosperm chloroplasts and mitochondria results in the conversion of cytidine to uridine by deamination . analysis of arabidopsis thaliana mutants affected in rna editing have shown that many pentatricopeptide repeat proteins _PROTEIN_ are required for specific cytidine deamination events . _PROTEIN_ proteins have been shown to be sequence specific rna binding proteins allowing the recognition of the c to be edited . the c terminal dyw domain present in many editing _PROTEIN_ has been proposed to catalyze c deamination as it shows sequence similarities with cytidine deaminases in other _METHOD_ . however many editing _PROTEIN_ such as the first to be discovered _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lack this domain so its importance has been unclear . using a reverse genetic approach we identified _PROTEIN_ an rna editing _PROTEIN_ acting specifically on the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ editing site recognized by _PROTEIN_ . unlike other known editing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ contains no identifiable _PROTEIN_ motifs but does contain a clear dyw domain . we were able to show interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ by bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation and to reconstitute a functional chimeric _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein complementing the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant . we propose that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ act together to edit the _PROTEIN_ site .
the _GENE_ gene _PROTEIN_ attracted our attention because it encodes a protein unique in arabidopsis with a clear dyw domain characteristic of the _PROTEIN_ dyw subgroup but lacking any identifiable _PROTEIN_ motifs . the intronless _GENE_ locus consists of a bp open reading frame encoding a putative amino acid protein . this protein is composed of a amino acid region with weak similarity to _PROTEIN_ proteins and a amino acid c terminal dyw domain . about arabidopsis proteins carry a dyw domain at the c terminus but _PROTEIN_ is the only one with no identifiable _PROTEIN_ e or e motifs . by contrast its dyw domain is highly conserved and is close to the dyw domain consensus . this implies that this domain is under strong selection and that _PROTEIN_ is not simply a degenerating pseudogene . two putatively full length gslt cdnas that correspond to the _GENE_ model have been described . both cdnas start just after the _PROTEIN_ codon of the _PROTEIN_ model _PROTEIN_ indicating that the _PROTEIN_ codon at position _PROTEIN_ is likely to be the translation start used in the plant cell . two apparent insertion mutants in the _GENE_ locus are listed in the t dna _PROTEIN_ database of the salk institute . after sequence verification of the insertions we found that the t dna in is inserted bp upstream of the _PROTEIN_ codon whereas the t dna in is inserted bp downstream of the orf . as neither insertion disrupts the _PROTEIN_ orf we requested a screen for ethyl methanesulfonate _METHOD_ induced mutations in the _GENE_ locus from the seattle arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ project . forty three different mutations across the bp locus were obtained . among them were in noncoding regions eight were in the orf but did not change the protein sequence and mutations _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ did alter the predicted protein sequence . one of these the _PROTEIN_ mutation was a deletion of a guanidine at the position _PROTEIN_ and caused a frameshift in the orf . the putative amino acid protein encoded by this allele would be identical to the wild type protein for the first amino acids then differ with a premature stop codon amino acids after the mutation . in particular this truncated protein would completely lack the dyw domain . this mutant and the other alleles were backcrossed three times to arabidopsis ecotype columbia to segregate other _METHOD_ induced mutations . homozygous mutant plants were identified after self pollination of heterozygous plants obtained after backcrossing . all of them exhibited a macroscopic phenotype identical to wild type col plants as shown for homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutants . using either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ as the start of the protein coding sequence both targetp and predotar predict that the _PROTEIN_ protein is targeted to chloroplasts . the cleavage site is predicted to be after the amino acid leading to a protein of kd after cleavage . to test this localization prediction two fusion proteins were transiently _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis plantlets . the sequences encoding the first or amino acids of the protein were fused in frame upstream of the red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ coding sequence . _PROTEIN_ of the fusion protein did not lead to detectable _METHOD_ . by contrast _PROTEIN_ of the fusion protein led to _METHOD_ specific _METHOD_ signals in _LOCATION_ . this observation was further confirmed by _PROTEIN_ of the full length protein fused to _METHOD_ . the emission spectrum of _METHOD_ was confirmed for these signals and they were shown to colocalize with chlorophyll _METHOD_ . a polyclonal antibody directed against _PROTEIN_ was used to detect the protein in subcellular fractions . figure shows that an kd signal was observed in a total extract of leaf proteins of arabidopsis and strongly increased in a subcellular fraction enriched in chloroplasts . by contrast this signal was not observed in a mitochondrial protein extract . both the transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ fusions and the analysis of subcellular fractions by immunoblot using a _PROTEIN_ specific antibody confirmed the bioinformatics predictions that the _PROTEIN_ protein is targeted to _LOCATION_ . most dyw proteins investigated to date have been shown to be involved in rna editing so we screened all known chloroplast editing sites in _PROTEIN_ by sequencing of rt pcr products surrounding these sites . among the sites a very strong defect was observed at the first editing site of the _PROTEIN_ transcript . none of the other sites were affected in the mutant . a complete lack of editing of _PROTEIN_ was confirmed by a quantitative and very sensitive poisoned primer extension _PROTEIN_ assay . the editing of the _PROTEIN_ site was also characterized by rt pcr product sequencing in the other _PROTEIN_ x alleles . a defect in three lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was observed with a reduction of to when compared with col . to confirm that the editing defect observed in _PROTEIN_ was a consequence of the frameshift in _PROTEIN_ the mutant was complemented with a bp genomic fragment comprising a region of bp before _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ orf and bp downstream . after agrobacterium tumefaciens transformation of _PROTEIN_ with this construct two complemented lines were shown to be restored in the editing of _PROTEIN_ by the _PROTEIN_ assay . this complementation experiment and the defects observed in weaker alleles demonstrated that the abolition of _PROTEIN_ editing shown by sequencing and _PROTEIN_ is due to the frameshift in _PROTEIN_ . to examine whether the loss of editing was a secondary effect of altered rna processing or rna stability the _PROTEIN_ transcript was analyzed by rna gel blot analysis of the _PROTEIN_ mutant compared with the wild type . no variation in the pattern or level of the monocistronic _PROTEIN_ or polycistronic _PROTEIN_ transcripts was observed . this result supports a specific and direct role of _PROTEIN_ in the editing of the _PROTEIN_ site . the _PROTEIN_ site is partially edited in the wild type plant and editing at this site converts a thr codon into a met codon that is the _PROTEIN_ putative translation initiation codon . the chloroplast ndh complex catalyzes electron donation probably from ferredoxin to plastoquinone . when ndh activity is present a transient increase of chlorophyll _METHOD_ can be observed when actinic light is switched off . we analyzed this change of _METHOD_ to examine whether or not the ndh complex was affected in _PROTEIN_ . unlike the col control the mutant showed no transient increase in _METHOD_ after the al was turned off . this defect was reverted in the complemented transgenic plants . immunoblot analysis using an antibody against _PROTEIN_ showed a _PROTEIN_ in the level of the ndh complex in _PROTEIN_ . the editing site impaired in the _PROTEIN_ mutant is exactly the same site that has been shown to be unedited in _PROTEIN_ mutants . to perform a fine comparison of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants were grown and characterized in parallel . the primary molecular defect _PROTEIN_ the resulting lack of ndh activity the _PROTEIN_ in the level of ndh complex and the macroscopic phenotypes of adult plants compared with the wild type were identical in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants are indistinguishable by phenotype indicating that the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins have essential roles in the same process . however the common phenotype also indicates that _PROTEIN_ is not able to complement the _PROTEIN_ function in the _PROTEIN_ background and equally _PROTEIN_ is not able to complement the _PROTEIN_ function in the _PROTEIN_ background . this observation could suggest that the _PROTEIN_ protein interacts with the _PROTEIN_ protein to form a protein complex that functions in _PROTEIN_ editing . to test this hypothesis we used bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation assays to visualize any interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in planta . in these experiments one protein is fused to the n terminal half of the yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and the potential partner is fused to the c terminal half of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . arabidopsis plantlets were transiently cotransformed with pairs of plasmids encoding _METHOD_ fusions . because each half of the _METHOD_ is not intrinsically _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ is observed only when intermolecular interactions occur between _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ tagged proteins . the emission spectrum of _METHOD_ was confirmed for each positive interaction . the results presented in table and figure show a positive interaction between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins that was not observed when the opposite interaction _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was assayed . furthermore no bifc signal was observed for coexpressed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ does not dimerize unlike known cytidine deaminases . to test the specificity of the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we tested the interaction between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ e protein necessary for the editing of clpp and _PROTEIN_ sites and functionally and structurally very similar to _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ did not interact with _PROTEIN_ in this assay as shown by the absence of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in plant cells . in addition several negative controls testing for interactions between either _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and unrelated proteins that have been shown to interact in _LOCATION_ using bifc were tested _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the consistent lack of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in these control cells supports that the _METHOD_ observed in the bifc assays resulted from a specific _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction . approximately of the editing _PROTEIN_ identified so far contain the e e and dyw motifs as defined by citation whereas the other lack these c terminal domains to varying degrees . _PROTEIN_ lacks a dyw domain and the c terminal amino acids of the e motif . interestingly _PROTEIN_ contains not only a complete dyw domain but also the c terminal segment of the e motif . thus a complex of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ would reconstitute all of the amino acid motifs found in full length editing _PROTEIN_ such as _PROTEIN_ . to test this model we crossed the _PROTEIN_ mutant with the _PROTEIN_ mutant to obtain a homozygous double mutant and then attempted to complement it with a chimeric construct consisting of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and e e domains and the _PROTEIN_ e dyw domain . as one would expect the double mutant completely lacks _PROTEIN_ editing . eight lines complemented with the chimeric construct were tested and all were shown to be restored for the editing of _PROTEIN_ by cdna sequencing . seven of the eight plants tested showed a higher proportion of edited transcripts than the wild type . thus a fusion of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is functional further evidence in favor of interaction between these two proteins .
