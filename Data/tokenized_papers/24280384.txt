apical growth in pollen tubes _PROTEIN_ is associated with the presence of tip focused ion gradients and fluxes implying _PROTEIN_ localization or regulation of the underlying transporters . the molecular identity and regulation of anion transporters in _PROTEIN_ is unknown . here we report a negative gradient of _LOCATION_ anion concentration focused on the tip in negative correlation with the _LOCATION_ concentration . we hypothesized that a possible link between these two ions is based on the presence of dependent protein kinases . we characterized anion channels and cpk transcripts in _PROTEIN_ and analyzed their localization . yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagging of a homolog of slow _PROTEIN_ channel _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was widespread along _PROTEIN_ but in accordance with the anion efflux _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was strictly localized at the tip _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ with either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in xenopus laevis oocytes elicited s type anion channel currents . interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was confirmed by resonance energy transfer _METHOD_ lifetime microscopy in arabidopsis thaliana mesophyll protoplasts and bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation in living _PROTEIN_ . compared with wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as well as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ had reduced anion currents . double mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ had reduced _LOCATION_ anion fluxes at the tip . our studies provide evidence for a dependent _PROTEIN_ regulation of the anion channel _PROTEIN_ to regulate _PROTEIN_ growth .
in lily and tobacco pollen tube growth is associated with quasi steady or oscillatory anion effluxes at the tip always correlated with growth rate furthermore the large efflux at the tip is accompanied by a steady nonoscillatory anion influx behind the tip . from the chemo osmotic point of view the rapid anion flux variations associated with the pollen tube tip favor a passive anion channel driven ion translocation mechanism rather than a carrier driven transport . to investigate the physiological role of in pollen tube growth we measured n. tabacum pollen tube diameters under various _LOCATION_ anion concentrations . the pollen tube diameter increased during an increase in _LOCATION_ concentration from to and finally mm . in seven time series experiments of the same concentration series the tube diameters were and respectively . the diameter increased by in mm compared with the mm control medium . we thus hypothesized that the _LOCATION_ anion concentration changes feedback on _LOCATION_ anion homeostasis . to test this hypothesis we performed live cell imaging experiments on biolistically transformed n. tabacum pollen tubes . we _PROTEIN_ the genetic anion sensitive probe chloride sensor to monitor changes in anion level . this cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ based fret sensor for anions has a relatively high anion sensitivity _PROTEIN_ in contrast with previous genetically encoded anion sensors . chloride sensor _PROTEIN_ tobacco pollen tubes were exposed to an increase in _LOCATION_ chloride concentration . false color coded ratio images of such a pollen tube recording are exemplified in the time series displayed in figure . to visualize the dynamic anion distribution of the whole time series experiment we generated a kymograph of the pollen tube ratio signal . a kymograph is an intuitive way to present ratio intensity dynamics in one dimension over time . standard growth conditions with mm in the medium revealed a _LOCATION_ anion gradient . high ratio values symbolizing high anion concentrations were apparent in the region to behind the tip . in contrast the tip and subapical region as well as the base of the tube revealed a relatively low ratio value . this anion distribution pattern was _PROTEIN_ during an increase in _LOCATION_ chloride concentration but the overall ratio intensity signal increased in stepwise fashion after each gradual concentration increase . the application of nitro benzoic acid an efficient anion channel blocker resulted in a dramatic _PROTEIN_ in ratio signal growth arrest and eventually pollen tube death . interestingly pronounced growth oscillations were observed after the application of mm chloride symbolized by the alternating modification of the kymograph slope as indicated by the arrows in figure . a detailed analysis of pollen tube growth velocity and apical _LOCATION_ anion concentration in figure demonstrates an apparent correlation in _METHOD_ of period and that these periods are in counter phase . a burst of growth was always accompanied by a _PROTEIN_ of the tip focused ratio value equivalent to a _PROTEIN_ in anion concentration in the pollen tube tip . this observation is in line with vibrating probe studies using anion selective _LOCATION_ electrodes demonstrating anion effluxes at the tip which is most pronounced when the outburst of a growth cycle begins . interestingly the period of the simultaneous growth and apical anion oscillations increased with increasing _LOCATION_ concentrations . a possible interference of the chloride sensor ratio signal through the well described ph gradient in growing pollen tubes was evaluated using the ratiometric _LOCATION_ ph sensor phluorin . again we biolistically transformed tobacco pollen and performed _LOCATION_ ph measurements during an increase in _LOCATION_ concentration using an experimental design similar to the one described for figure . if a pronounced ph effect within the chloride sensor ratio signal exists one would expect a similar _LOCATION_ ratio signal using the two probes . interestingly an elevation in _LOCATION_ chloride concentration increased the apical ph gradient at the tip however the relative anion concentration in the extreme tip does not vary in such a fashion . in addition a change in _LOCATION_ ph could not be detected in the zone behind the subapical region where a pronounced increase in the chloride sensor ratio value occurs . a comparison of the ratio signal of both probes thus illustrated their fundamental differences along growing pollen tubes during an increase in the _LOCATION_ chloride concentration and point to negligible crosstalk within our experimental design . interestingly the apical ph gradient started to oscillate when we increased the _LOCATION_ chloride concentration . on in vitro growing conditions it is well established that pollen tubes tend to display oscillations in growth rate which are associated with changes in tip localized cyt changes in various species . a set of cpks was recently demonstrated to regulate anion channel activity in guard cells . to test whether a relationship exists between anion and homeostasis at the pollen tube tip we _PROTEIN_ the cyt reporter yellow cameleon . transiently transformed tobacco pollen grains were grown in medium containing mm chloride and cyt was monitored upon the application of mm chloride as in figure . the false color coded kymograph of time lapse images of a representative pollen tube _PROTEIN_ time is presented in figure . simultaneous analysis of the tip focused cyt gradient and growth rate demonstrates a weakly oscillating tip focused cyt gradient under standard growth conditions . upon application of mm chloride however pronounced growth alterations were recorded and tip focused cyt started to oscillate robustly . high cyt at the tip correlated with increased growth velocity which corresponded with a reduction in _LOCATION_ anion concentration at the tip indicating a temporal coupling of anion and homeostasis . in support of this observation switching back from mm to mm _LOCATION_ chloride resulted in a dampening of the cyt and growth velocity oscillations . application of nppb however abolished the tip focused cyt gradient and reduced growth velocity . to identify anion channels _PROTEIN_ in pollen tubes quantitative rt pcr was performed with cdna from in vitro grown arabidopsis pollen tubes . the transcript numbers of slac/slah type and aluminum activated malate transporter/quickly activating _PROTEIN_ channel type anion channel proteins were normalized to transcripts . relative transcript numbers of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were and respectively . transcripts of _PROTEIN_ were at the detection level whereas other members of the slac/slah family _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ appeared not to be _PROTEIN_ in pollen tubes . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were thus considered as pollen anion channels . employing a _PROTEIN_ promotor _PROTEIN_ line _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was confirmed in pollen grains and pollen tubes within the pistil of arabidopsis . because _PROTEIN_ was already identified as a target of cpk action in guard cells we decided to focus on the effect of _PROTEIN_ on pollen tube performance . first we biolistically transformed n. tabacum pollen tubes and determined the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ . the fusion protein of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed a uniform _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ with a slight tendency to _PROTEIN_ toward the apex . in contrast with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ anion channel soluble _METHOD_ could be detected throughout the _LOCATION_ . the s type anion channel _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in guard cells and mesophyll cells and its activation depends on trans phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ . we hypothesized that in the context of tip growth pollen tube _PROTEIN_ cpks could also interact with _PROTEIN_ . on the basis of results of a database analysis and transcriptomic data from citation we cloned the pollen _PROTEIN_ cpks and transiently _PROTEIN_ them as _METHOD_ fusion proteins in n. tabacum pollen tubes . the cpk family comprises members that can be divided into four subgroups . the majority of cpk family members harbor a putative n terminal myristoylation and/or palmitoylation site suggesting that they are _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ associated target proteins . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are relatively closely related proteins from subgroup i . these kinases are predicted to lack a myristoylation site and they indeed revealed a cytoplasmic _METHOD_ signal when fused to a _METHOD_ protein . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from subgroups iii and iv are predicted to be myristoylated and appeared to have a dual subcellular localization . a minor _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ signal was detected which was absent from the tip . however the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal of _PROTEIN_ was visible in the vegetative _LOCATION_ and that of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ of the generative cell . a more diffuse _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was detected in the base of the pollen tube with an increasing intensity toward the grain but it was absent from the _LOCATION_ on the first to . closely related _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from subgroup i are specifically _PROTEIN_ in pollen tubes and root hairs . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ revealed a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ signal exclusively at the growing pollen tube tip . tissue specific gus activity of transgenic arabidopsis plants carrying gus or gus showed strong promoter activity in pollen and a tip localized _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was confirmed in transgenic arabidopsis plants carrying _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . double loss of function mutants of the similar _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are impaired in pollen tube growth and subsequently in fertilization . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of the pollen tube tip but their physiological target proteins are not known . the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ at the tip is in line with our hypotheses of cpk induced anion channel activation . to test whether posttranscriptional modifications at the n terminus are important for unique _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ targeting of the latter cpks we generated point mutation constructs eliminating myristoylation and/or palmitoylation sites of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . eliminating either myristoylation or palmitoylation resulted in a cytoplasmic localization of both cpk proteins . an n terminal _METHOD_ fusion of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ prevented correct _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ targeting as well and gave rise to _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ in pollen tubes _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . these results strongly indicate the necessity of posttranslational modification for the distinct subcellular localization patterns of _LOCATION_ associated pollen cpks presented in figure . next we hypothesized that pollen tube cpks phosphorylate _PROTEIN_ in a calcium dependent fashion similar to previous studies of the guard cell anion channels _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which are activated via _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation when coexpressed . to identify interacting partners for _PROTEIN_ among the putative cpk candidates localized to the pollen tube tip we performed fret flim . therefore _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as well as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with a c terminal mturquoise _METHOD_ fusion were either _PROTEIN_ alone or coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ lifetime was recorded under both conditions . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ alone resulted in an average _METHOD_ lifetime of ns and ns respectively . no significant reduction of the average _METHOD_ lifetime was detectable when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the average _METHOD_ lifetimes of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ alone were ns and ns respectively and were thus comparable with the average lifetimes of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ alone . however the average _METHOD_ lifetime was significantly reduced to ns and ns respectively when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . these results indicated a specific interaction of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with the anion channel _PROTEIN_ . the average lifetime of _METHOD_ alone and a _METHOD_ _METHOD_ fusion were compared as an additional control and gave rise to a strong reduction of the _METHOD_ lifetime from ns to ns in _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cells . a _METHOD_ lifetime reduction of ps in _PROTEIN_ and ps in _PROTEIN_ coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ was much less than the _PROTEIN_ in the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ fusion protein most likely because of the transient nature of the interaction between cpks and their target proteins . _METHOD_ bifc was also used to test the association between _PROTEIN_ and the different cpks . results and controls are shown in supplemental figure online . however in control experiments a _METHOD_ complementation could be detected with a coexpression of the c terminal half of a _METHOD_ and the n terminal half of the _METHOD_ alone or _PROTEIN_ yn yc in the cytoplasm _PROTEIN_ yn yc at the _LOCATION_ of the apex and _PROTEIN_ yn yc _PROTEIN_ yc yn and _PROTEIN_ yn _PROTEIN_ uniformly at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . when bifc constructs of yc _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ yn were coexpressed it was difficult to find and image intact pollen tubes because the majority collapsed and died . interestingly we detected a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ complementation exclusively at the apex pointing to a specific _PROTEIN_ complex forming only at the pollen tube tip . in combination with the fret flim results these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interact . however the pleiotropic localization responses observed for the different controls most likely because of a general overexpression of the proteins would advise for caution for direct conclusions from the bifc data . to further detail the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and tip localized pollen specific cpks in relation to anion channel function we took advantage of the two electrode voltage clamp technique . we injected the crna of _PROTEIN_ fused to the c terminal half of _METHOD_ together with a variety of elongation _PROTEIN_ hand truncated cpk versions . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were fused to the n terminal half of _METHOD_ in x. laevis oocytes to analyze ion currents and bifc . in this type of experiment bifc conclusions are directly verifiable by the induction of currents . ef hand truncated cpk versions were used because their kinase activity is independent of oocyte _LOCATION_ variations . to resolve anion currents voltage clamped oocytes were exposed to a depolarization voltage pulse of mv to allow channel activation followed by s voltage pulses ranging from to mv in mv _PROTEIN_ . these voltage steps were followed by a s voltage pulse to mv . s type anion channel activity is characterized by slow deactivating currents upon voltage steps from depolarized to hyperpolarized _LOCATION_ potentials whereas instantaneous or slowly activating currents are recorded in the depolarized voltage range . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ yc alone or coexpression of _PROTEIN_ yc with _PROTEIN_ yn or _PROTEIN_ yn did not elicit macroscopic anion currents . however coexpression of _PROTEIN_ yn or _PROTEIN_ yn with _PROTEIN_ yc resulted in instantaneous currents with typical time dependent s type anion channel deactivation kinetics . _PROTEIN_ which is known to activate _PROTEIN_ was coexpressed as a positive control and gave rise to macroscopic currents comparable to those with _PROTEIN_ . in line with a phosphorylation dependent anion channel activation point mutation versions of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ rendering the kinase inactive did not result in macroscopic _PROTEIN_ currents . mean steady state _PROTEIN_ currents at mv are presented upon coexpression with the cpks as indicated in figure and revealed with _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ and with _PROTEIN_ . for _PROTEIN_ yc alone coexpression of the anion channel with _PROTEIN_ yn _PROTEIN_ yn _PROTEIN_ yn or _PROTEIN_ yn did not elicit macroscopic currents . as expected oocytes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ yc alone exhibited no yellow _METHOD_ signal upon spectroscopic analysis . coexpression of _PROTEIN_ yc with _PROTEIN_ yn or _PROTEIN_ yn resulted in weak _METHOD_ _METHOD_ whereas _PROTEIN_ yn _PROTEIN_ yn _PROTEIN_ yn _PROTEIN_ yn and _PROTEIN_ yn showed a bright _LOCATION_ bifc signal indicating a physical interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . double barreled electrodes were used to impale growing arabidopsis pollen tubes on a semi solid medium to characterize anion currents using the tevc technique . wild type and mutant pollen grains were germinated in parallel by dotting freshly harvested flowers on semi solid medium . to resolve pollen tube anion currents a potassium free medium was used to exclude typical time dependent hyperpolarization activating k currents which occur in the presence of mm _LOCATION_ potassium . an increase in medium concentration from to and mm while _PROTEIN_ constant and nominal mm k concentration resulted in a current amplitude increase in the negative and positive voltage range . negative or positive currents represent anion efflux from or influx into the cell respectively . increasing media concentrations resulted in a reversal potential shift toward more positive potentials . the reversal potentials at and mm medium concentration were mv mv mv and mv respectively . according to the nernst equation this indicates a _LOCATION_ accumulation with increasing media anion concentration from mm to mm mm and mm respectively . in line with a times higher to permeability and an _LOCATION_ dependent _PROTEIN_ channel activation we recorded higher anion currents in compared with conditions . a plot of the steady state current/voltage relation demonstrated an up to fold increase in negative current for pollen grown in a mm based versus mm based medium . because of the high variation in currents only a significant difference in the voltage range from to mv was apparent . these s type currents could be blocked by and of the anion channel blockers niflumic acid and nppb by and at mv respectively . currents were significantly blocked at all voltages applied except and mv for nppb and at mv for na . these anion channel blockers are weak acids and acidify the cytoplasm of growing pollen tubes but a _LOCATION_ acidification per se for example through acetate does not have an effect on anion currents or pollen growth . this demonstrates that both channel blockers specifically block s type anion channels under our experimental conditions . to investigate the in vivo function of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we isolated t dna insertion lines of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ alleles . we performed voltage clamp experiments with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as well as double _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants and recorded anion currents in pollen tubes grown in chloride as well as nitrate based medium . we used double _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants to avoid gene redundancy because _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are both _PROTEIN_ in pollen tubes and closely related proteins . similar to patch clamp analysis of anion currents in lily pollen tube protoplasts our analysis revealed depolarization activated slowly deactivating currents in wild type columbia whereas typical s type anion currents were absent or strongly reduced in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant cells . a plot of the steady state currents from _LOCATION_ voltages clamped from mv to mv revealed significantly reduced anion currents in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes in both chloride based and nitrate based solution pointing to a function for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in s type anion channel regulation . the steady state currents were significantly reduced in _PROTEIN_ at voltages from to mv and to mv and in _PROTEIN_ at voltages from to mv and to mv whereas the currents recorded for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were significantly reduced from to mv and from to mv . the steady state current of col wild type pollen was na that of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen was na and those of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ pollen were na and na respectively at a _LOCATION_ potential of mv . tip focused anion efflux was quantified by means of ion selective vibrating microelectrodes in arabidopsis wild type col _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant pollen tubes . in contrast with mean anion fluxes of pmol in wild type col _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant pollen tubes were characterized by reduced anion fluxes with pmol and pmol respectively . however because of the great variation in fluxes we could not confirm this variation to be statistically significant . pollen tubes of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants demonstrated a reduced growth rate compared with col . mean growth rates of in the wild type were recorded whereas _PROTEIN_ was characterized by a growth rate of and that of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants was significantly reduced to .
arabidopsis thaliana ecotype col plants were grown on soil and cultivated in growth chambers for to weeks under short day conditions and after that in a greenhouse in long day conditions with illumination provided by _METHOD_ tubes . unless otherwise stated experiments were performed using a. thaliana ecotype col as wild type . in the case of transcript quantification the pollen tube growth medium was composed of the following mes kcl and . the standard medium for electrophysiological measurements with arabidopsis pollen tubes consisted of the following mes and either or . for media with different anion concentrations ca _PROTEIN_ was used to ensure unaltered concentrations . tevc measurements of arabidopsis pollen were performed in medium containing the following mes supplemented with either or k _PROTEIN_ to resolve k channel activity . osmolarity of all arabidopsis pollen media was adjusted to mosmol with d suc and ph was adjusted to with tris . tobacco _PROTEIN_ plants were grown on soil with a day/night regime of h and a temperature of to to provided by a klux white light until flowering for pollen collection . pollen used in all assays was collected from anthers immediately after anthesis and used fresh or frozen at . tobacco pollen germination medium consisted of the following mes and . the ph was adjusted to with tris and osmolarity was adjusted to mosmol with d succhrose . essentially was kept constant and k was not added to the medium for the application of different concentrations . to elevate only we adjusted its concentration with hcl and buffered the medium with tris . osmolarity was kept the same in all solutions and was adjusted with suc . suc content in the medium with mm chloride was . thus we assumed that we were working with suc concentrations that were saturating in _METHOD_ of suc transporter capacity in all media . for transient transformation of mesophyll protoplasts arabidopsis ecotype col plants grown on soil were kept under short day conditions for to weeks . mesophyll protoplasts were prepared using the tape arabidopsis sandwich method . in tevc studies oocytes were perfused with tris/mes buffers . the standard solution contained the following mes/tris ca _PROTEIN_ mg _PROTEIN_ and . osmolality was adjusted to mosmol/kg with d sorbitol . particle bombardment was performed using a homemade biolistic device similar to the _PROTEIN_ biolistic system . a way valve allowed application hold and release of the vacuum to the chamber while a magnetic valve controlled helium pressure pulse injection . approximately mg tungsten particles of diameter were coated with plasmid dna according to the bio rad instruction manual . particles diluted in water were placed on a filter screwed in position right behind the pressure valve . the parameters of particle travel distance were as follows cm between the filter and a grid and cm between the grid and the pollen . bombardment of hydrated n. tabacum pollen grains was spotted on agarose plates containing standard tobacco growth medium . after transformation tobacco pollen were transferred to dishes glued to precision cover slips of mm previously coated with poly and mixed with warm tobacco medium containing low melt agarose resulting in a final agarose concentration of . on a hot plate pollen grains were allowed to sink to the bottom of cover slip glass needless medium was discarded and the remaining medium was allowed to solidify at room temperature . this procedure allowed pollen tubes to grow on the surface of the cover slip in a manner that was suitable for imaging . widefield imaging of n. tabacum pollen tubes was performed on an inverted zeiss microscope axioobserver _PROTEIN_ . hardware and data management were performed via visiview software _METHOD_ . fluorophores were excited with the visichrome high speed polychromator system _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ was captured through either a or objective and a pixel evolve emccd camera . for _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ illumination excitation wavelengths of nm or nm were used respectively and _METHOD_ emission was reflected via a dual band dichroic mirror and filtered with a dual band emitter . a position high speed filter wheel mounted at the side port equipped with a _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ bandpass filter was used to separate the emission wavelengths of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . for illumination _METHOD_ emission was recorded under _METHOD_ excitation at nm _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ under cpf excitation _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the sensor was illuminated the same way and _METHOD_ was recorded at _METHOD_ excitation _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and ratio analysis was performed with three channels . because the emission spectrum of _METHOD_ the _METHOD_ fret acceptor protein in the sensor is dependent on h concentrations the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ ratio of the sensor possesses degrees of ph dependency originating from the ph gradient in pollen tubes . to subtract the ph dependency of the fret ratio signal the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ channel was divided by the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ channel prior to the division by the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ channel which is ph independent . the ph probe phluorin was excited at nm and nm and emission was filtered through a dichroic mirror and bandpass filter . image processing was performed using macbiophotonics imagej . simultaneous pollen tube growth and ratio analysis were performed with a self made script for the octave free software . data were processed and plotted with igor pro software . because of the probe photobleaching and phototoxicity that occur during long term live cell imaging experiments we were not able to determine cross correlation in the subsecond range between the _LOCATION_ anion as well as and h gradients and growth velocity in detail . for documentation of the oocyte bifc results and the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in arabidopsis pollen tubes images were taken with a confocal laser scanning microscope _METHOD_ equipped with leica hcx irapo and hcx pl apo w _PROTEIN_ cs objectives respectively . voltage clamp experiments on pollen tubes were performed by impalement with double barreled electrodes using a drift free piezo driven sensapex micromanipulator . double barreled electrodes were pulled from two borosilicate capillaries with filament . the two capillaries were aligned heated and twisted in a customized vertical electrode puller and finally pulled on a horizontal laser puller as described previously . both barrels were filled with mm kcl and connected by means of ag/agcl wires to the microelectrode amplifier equipped with head stages of input impedance . voltage clamp protocols were applied with pulse software . data were low pass filtered at khz and sampled at khz . arabidopsis pollen tubes were grown on the top of a semisolid medium containing low melt agarose . to ensure a high germination rate only freshly opened flowers were used and dipped on the surface of the semisolid medium . germinated pollen tubes were covered with liquid medium to h after dipping in medium with the same composition prior to electrode impalement . after impalement the _LOCATION_ potential was recorded until values reached a plateau usually within to s. pollen tubes were voltage clamped at the free running _LOCATION_ potential only to perform current recordings and when voltage pulses in the range of mv to mv were applied . tevc recordings were performed with xenopus laevis oocytes to d after crna injection with a turbo tec amplifier . the electrodes were filled with m kcl and had typical input resistances of to . voltage clamp protocols were applied with patchmaster software . starting from a holding potential of mv single s voltage pulses were applied in mv _PROTEIN_ from to mv followed by a s voltage pulse to mv . instantaneous currents were extracted directly after the voltage jump from the holding potential of mv to _METHOD_ test pulses ranging from to mv . data points with _LOCATION_ bars represent the mean sd and statistical significance was verified by a paired student 's t test . _LOCATION_ anion flux measurements were performed as follows . arabidopsis pollen grains were collected from fresh flowers and germinated in liquid medium containing the following kcl hepes and of suc at ph . after at least h of incubation at measurements were performed on growing pollen tubes that were at least in length . the respective growth rate was evaluated simultaneously with the _LOCATION_ anionic fluxes defined as the total length grown during the experiment divided by the amount of time spanned . _LOCATION_ anionic flux at the pollen tube tip was estimated with the ion selective vibrating probe . anion specific microelectrodes were fabricated from mm borosilicate glass capillaries and pulled with a sutter p electrode puller baked at overnight and then internally covered with n n dimethyltrimethylethylsilamine for min . electrodes were backfilled with mm kcl and subsequently front loaded with a column of the anion selective liquid cocktail . a silver/silver chloride wire was inserted into the back of the electrode and a dry electrode was used as a reference . electrode calibration was performed by measuring the nernst potential of three different concentration solutions . electrode positioning and vibrating was performed with a stepper motor driven three dimensional positioner . data acquisition setting of the voltage parameters and the three dimensional electrode micromanipulator were controlled via aset software . the ion selective probe vibrated with an excursion of completing the cycle of acquisition in s which includes a tunable settling time after each move two measurement periods and the respective excursion time . all measurements were obtained as close as possible to the tip _LOCATION_ without touching the tube . background voltage values were taken after each measurement away from any other pollen grain or tube and the values were subtracted from the millivolt differential recordings during data processing using a custom made microsoft excel sheet . fluxes were calculated using fick s law and the chloride diffusion coefficient in aqueous solution at . a gus staining assay was performed on fully opened flowers of the gus reporter gene line grown as described in the section on plant material growth conditions and media . flowers were submerged in ml staining solution _PROTEIN_ and vacuum infiltrated for min . the samples were incubated overnight at followed by several washing steps with ethanol to destain specimens . documentation was performed with a keyence vhx digital microscope and was processed via macbiophotonics imagej software . a. thaliana ecotype col pollen were collected via the vacuum cleaner method and germinated/grown by placing pollen grain covered gaze directly on semisolid medium containing agarose . after h the tissue was frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground using glass beads . rna isolation of pollen tubes was performed using oligo dt dynabeads according to the manufacturer s instructions with some minor modifications . ground pollen tube samples were mixed with lysis buffer agitated for min and centrifuged and the supernatant was then mixed with activated dynabeads . after min on a rotation mixer beads were washed consecutively with buffer containing lithium dodecylsulfate and with non lithium dodecylsulfate containing buffer . after every washing step the beads were separated from the supernatant by magnetic force . washed mrna was eluted from the dynabeads in elution buffer at . the purified mrna was subsequently used for cdna synthesis performed by adding poly primer deoxynucleotide triphosphate and master mix incubated at for min and then placed on ice . reverse transcriptase was added and the sample was incubated for h at . quantitative rt pcr was performed according to the abgene sybr green assay in an eppendorf realplex cycler . for transcription quantification cdna was diluted in containing t rna . samples were mixed with sybr green mix and a gene specific primer mix . a detailed list of the qrt pcr primers used is presented in supplemental table online . in addition to the pollen cdna samples an internal standard curve for each gene was quantified . transcripts were normalized to molecules of using standard curves calculated for the individual pcr products . fret flim measurements between mturquoise _METHOD_ and venus _METHOD_ were performed as described previously using the bio rad radiance _PROTEIN_ system combined with a nikon te inverted microscope . two photon excitation pulses were generated by a ti sapphire laser pumped by a w coherent verdi laser . pulse trains of mhz were produced . the excitation light was directly coupled to the microscope and focused into the sample using a _PROTEIN_ plan apochromat water immersion objective lens with a numerical aperture of . _METHOD_ emission was detected using the nondescanned single photon counting hamamatsu hpm hybrid detector using a bandpass filter . images with a frame size of pixels were acquired . donor _METHOD_ lifetimes _METHOD_ were analyzed using spcimage software and a two component decay model . the statistical significance of differences between donor only and donor acceptor combinations was determined using student s t test . to analyze the subcellular localization of the ion channels and cpks used in this study their cdna was cloned into a plant _PROTEIN_ vector as described by citation with a cloning technique based on a uracil specific excision reagent combined with a proof reading dna polymerase . the plant _PROTEIN_ vector used was based on a _PROTEIN_ vector containing either the full length _METHOD_ or n or c terminal halves upstream or downstream of a user cassette . similar to studies described previously gene _PROTEIN_ was ensured through the promoter and terminator sequence of the and ribulose bis phosphate _PROTEIN_ enzyme downstream and upstream of the user cassette respectively . the primers used to amplify the
