the trans _LOCATION_ network is a tubular vesicular organelle that matures from the trans cisternae of the _LOCATION_ apparatus . in plants the tgn functions as a central hub for three trafficking pathways the secretory pathway the _LOCATION_ trafficking pathway and the endocytic pathway . here we describe a novel tgn localized _LOCATION_ protein _PROTEIN_ vascular _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ that is crucial for tgn function in arabidopsis . the _PROTEIN_ gene was originally identified from the stem vascular patterning mutant of arabidopsis thaliana . however the molecular function of _PROTEIN_ was not identified . _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ proteins co localized with the tgn marker proteins syntaxin of plants and _LOCATION_ type h _PROTEIN_ subunit . consistently _PROTEIN_ localized compartments were sensitive to concanamycin a a specific inhibitor of vha . intriguingly _PROTEIN_ mutants exhibited abnormal _LOCATION_ morphologies including a reduction in the number of _LOCATION_ cisternae and a reduced association between the tgn and the _LOCATION_ apparatus . a deficiency in _PROTEIN_ also resulted in a defect in _LOCATION_ protein sorting which was characterized by the abnormal accumulation of storage protein precursors in seeds . moreover we found that the development of an idioblast the myrosin cell was abnormally increased in _PROTEIN_ leaves . our results demonstrate that the novel tgn localized protein _PROTEIN_ is required for _LOCATION_ morphology _LOCATION_ trafficking and myrosin cell development .
to determine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ we constructed translational fusions of either _METHOD_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ _METHOD_ with the genomic _PROTEIN_ sequence and introduced each of them into _PROTEIN_ mutants . stereomicroscopic analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ throughout the whole plant examined . both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ complemented the defects in root growth and stem elongation in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . this indicates that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are functional . confocal microscopic analysis of the transgenic plants revealed that the _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ proteins were localized on mobile punctate structures . to identify the _PROTEIN_ localized structures we stained cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with the endocytic tracer . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and rapidly co localized at the punctate structures after min of staining . one of the earliest organelles labeled by is the tgn therefore this observation suggested that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized at the tgn . to verify this we treated seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with brefeldin a which is a fungal toxin that causes an agglomeration of the tgn and endosomes to form bfa compartments in arabidopsis . co localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with the bfa compartments would support the notion that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized at the tgn . the results showed that bfa treatment caused the relocation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to the core of bfa compartments that are labeled by . this was consistent with a rapid co localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and and strongly suggested that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized to the tgn . we further confirmed the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ by performing co localization experiments using well established _METHOD_ organelle markers . transgenic arabidopsis lines stably _PROTEIN_ each of the tgn markers _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and the prevacuolar compartment and tonoplast marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were used in combination with either _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . confocal microscopy visualization showed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ co localized with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and vha _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ co localized with vha _METHOD_ . in contrast no co localization was detected between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . in addition a transient _PROTEIN_ analysis in tobacco leaf cells revealed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not co localize with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a trans _LOCATION_ marker . furthermore _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ punctate structures in arabidopsis were sensitive to conca a v _PROTEIN_ inhibitor which caused aggregation of the tgn . taken together these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is localized to the tgn . previous studies reported that tgn localized proteins were required for the _PROTEIN_ of normal morphologies of the _LOCATION_ and tgn . therefore the tgn localization of _PROTEIN_ prompted us to investigate the ultrastructure of the _LOCATION_ apparatus and the tgn in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . we found that the tgn did not associate with _LOCATION_ stacks in _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ was required for the association of the tgn with the trans side of the _LOCATION_ apparatus . in addition the number of cisternae per _LOCATION_ stack in _PROTEIN_ was less than that in wild type ler . however the length of _LOCATION_ cisternae in _PROTEIN_ was indistinguishable from that in ler . these observations suggest that _PROTEIN_ is involved in the organization of the _LOCATION_ apparatus and the tgn . the tgn localization of _PROTEIN_ suggested that _PROTEIN_ could be involved in protein sorting at the tgn . to examine the involvement of _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ protein transport we analyzed the transport of major storage proteins into protein storage _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ seeds . a defect in the transport of storage proteins should result in an abnormal accumulation of precursor _METHOD_ of globulin and albumin in seeds and their missorting out of cells . immunoblot analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and their seeds _PROTEIN_ abnormally accumulated the precursor _METHOD_ in their seeds suggesting a defect in transport into the psvs . _METHOD_ analysis with anti globulin antibody revealed a positive signal surrounding cells in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in addition to the strong signal in the psvs within cells . these results indicate that globulin is abnormally secreted out of the mutant cells in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seeds demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ functions in the efficient transport of _LOCATION_ proteins . _PROTEIN_ exhibited more severe defects in _LOCATION_ protein sorting than _PROTEIN_ . this is consistent with other phenotypes _PROTEIN_ showed more severe defects in stem vascular patterning stem elongation and root growth . _PROTEIN_ was previously shown to be involved in the vascular patterning in _METHOD_ but not in leaves and cotyledons . consistent with this report our quantitative analysis of the number of vein junctions in a leaf revealed that the complexity of vascular development in leaves of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is indistinguishable from that in the wild type . apparent vein patterning in a whole leaf in each mutant is similar to that of the wild type . however in a more detailed observation significant portions of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ leaves showed the v shaped vein splice at the leaf tips which was not observed in ler leaves . in addition _PROTEIN_ mutants exhibited abnormal tangled branches of leaf veins . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ functions in vein patterning in leaves . next we examined the development of the myrosin cell in _PROTEIN_ mutants because we previously found an abnormally increased development of myrosin cells in the defective mutants of family proteins . to evaluate the development of myrosin cells quantitatively we measured the accumulation levels of the myrosin cell protein thioglucoside _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which is one of the two major myrosinases in arabidopsis . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ leaves accumulated higher levels of _PROTEIN_ than wild type leaves . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is required for myrosin cell differentiation in leaves . to analyze the distribution pattern of myrosin cells in a whole leaf we developed a transgenic line that specifically _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ reporter in myrosin cells . the promoter of the gus construct was derived from the kb upstream region of _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ . gus stained cells were distributed along the leaf vein in the wild type background . these cells were easily stained by _METHOD_ brilliant blue which was previously used to stain the myrosin cells . to confirm further the specificity of the promoter we compared the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ with that of venus _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the _PROTEIN_ promoter was used previously as a specific promoter for myrosin cells . cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ also _PROTEIN_ venus at the inner tissue layer of leaves . these results confirmed that the promoter was specific for myrosin cells . we introduced the gus reporter into _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ leaves had an increased number of myrosin cells that formed denser network patterns _PROTEIN_ . collectively our results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is required for the proper development of myrosin cells .

targeting venus sequence were cloned into pdonr and pentr d topo respectively . subsequently these two plasmids were introduced into the binary vector by the lr reaction to generate venus . to generate the gus construct the kb promoter region of _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ was amplified and the promoter region of the binary vector was replaced with the amplified fragment using restriction enzymes . to generate the _METHOD_ construct the same region of _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ was cloned into pentr d topo . next we introduced this plasmid into the binary vector using an lr reaction . agrobacterium
