the _LOCATION_ envelope acts as a selective barrier to macromolecule trafficking between the _LOCATION_ and the cytoplasm and undergoes a complex reorganization during mitosis . different eukaryotic _METHOD_ show specializations in ne function and composition . in contrast with vertebrates the protein composition of the ne and the function of ne proteins are barely understood in plants . _METHOD_ attachment _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is a plant specific ne associated protein first identified in tomato . here we demonstrate that two arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ homologs _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are associated with the ne specifically in undifferentiated cells of the root tip . reentry into cell cycle after callus induction from differentiated root segments _METHOD_ their ne association . based on green _METHOD_ protein fusions and immunogold labeling data the proteins are associated with the outer ne and the _LOCATION_ pores in interphase cells and with the immature cell plate during cytokinesis . rna interference based suppression of the arabidopsis wpp family causes shorter primary roots a reduced number of _PROTEIN_ roots and reduced mitotic activity of the root meristem . together these data demonstrate the existence of regulated ne targeting in plants and identify a class of plant specific ne proteins involved in mitotic activity .
plant rangap has been shown to contain an n terminal ne targeting domain that appears to be unique to plants and is not shared with yeast or mammalian rangap . this domain called the wpp domain is similar to the ne associated protein _PROTEIN_ from tomato . we used the tomato _PROTEIN_ sequence to identify proteins encoded in the arabidopsis genome similar to the wpp domain . in addition to the two members of the rangap family _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ there are three open reading frames encoding small wpp domain containing proteins similar to _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis termed wpp domain proteins and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . figure shows the alignment of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and the n terminal domains of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . among the arabidopsis proteins _PROTEIN_ is most closely related to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are more closely related to each other than to _PROTEIN_ and all three family members are more closely related to each other than they are to the rangap wpp domains . a polyclonal rabbit antiserum was raised against recombinant _PROTEIN_ . the antiserum _PROTEIN_ recognized recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ affinity . the top panel in figure shows an immunoblot analysis performed on total protein extracts from different arabidopsis organs with the _PROTEIN_ antibody . a single band of kd was detected in flowers leaves roots and _METHOD_ . although the predicted size of wpp proteins is between and kd all three recombinant proteins also have an apparent molecular weight in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of to kd . a similar observation is obtained with tomato _PROTEIN_ . in addition a band was detected at kd which is the predicted size of _PROTEIN_ . to investigate the _PROTEIN_ pattern of each gene separately rt pcr with gene specific primers was performed . figure shows that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was detected in leaves roots and _METHOD_ but not flowers whereas _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was detected in all four organs . endogenous tomato _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ are localized at the ne of suspension cultured cells . the subcellular localization of the arabidopsis wpp family was investigated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as _METHOD_ fusion proteins under the control of the promoter in transiently transformed arabidopsis protoplasts . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulated at the ne and showed an additional diffuse staining in the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ similar to the localization pattern of _PROTEIN_ . by contrast _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is present in the _LOCATION_ and in the cytoplasm but does not accumulate at the ne resembling the distribution of free _METHOD_ . inspection of the sequence alignment revealed that _PROTEIN_ is missing several amino acid residues conserved among the other wpp domain proteins . therefore a possible reason for its different behavior is that some of these conserved residues are necessary for ne targeting . figure shows the secondary structure prediction of _PROTEIN_ using methods described by citation and citation . the underlined wpp motif is conserved in all known higher and lower plant wpp domain proteins and was shown to be crucial for _PROTEIN_ targeting to the ne . to determine whether the same motif is important for _PROTEIN_ ne localization wpp was mutated to aap . this mutation disrupts the ne targeting of _PROTEIN_ as shown in figure . to define the minimal length of the wpp domain we took advantage of the extension of the most conserved domain in an alignment of all known wpp domain containing proteins which coincides with the domain predicted to consist of a strand and three helices in figure . two deletion constructs indicated by the arrows in figure were _PROTEIN_ as _METHOD_ fusions and analyzed for accumulation at the ne level . figure shows that residues to are sufficient for ne targeting whereas residues to are not . together these data suggest that the central most conserved domain of _PROTEIN_ is sufficient for ne targeting and that the wp motif is required . to investigate the localization pattern of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in different cell types arabidopsis transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ the fusion proteins under the control of the promoter were created . seven day old light grown seedlings were imaged for _METHOD_ localization by confocal microscopy . figure shows the definition of zones of the primary root used in figure and the text . root zone a includes the division and elongation zone . root zone b includes the maturation zone defined by the appearance of root hairs and indicative of differentiated cells . root zone a spans mm from the tip of a primary root in arabidopsis seedlings . figure shows an overview of root zone a cells of a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic line indicating the accumulation of the fusion protein at the ne in the small undifferentiated cells in this zone . figure shows the localization pattern of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and free _METHOD_ in cells of root zone a root zone b hypocotyl cells and leaf epidermis cells . as seen in arabidopsis protoplasts the distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is indistinguishable from free _METHOD_ in all cell types imaged indicating that this protein does not have a functional ne targeting domain . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are targeted to the ne in root zone a cells . in contrast with this specific localization pattern the distribution of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in these lines resembled that of free _METHOD_ in the other three cell types . root zone a is composed of cells that have recently divided or are primed for cell division . all other cell types shown are differentiated and have exited the cell cycle . this indicates that ne targeting of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is developmentally regulated and likely corresponds to the undifferentiated cycling status of the cells . as evident from figures and a less intense labeling of the cell cortex and of cytoplasmic speckles was also observed . whereas ne association was consistently observed labeling of the cell cortex and the speckles was only found in some cells . there was no difference between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with respect to this pattern . localization in cytoplasmic speckles had also been observed for _PROTEIN_ . to investigate their identity we performed a dual labeling experiment with transiently transformed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and biodipy tr ceramide to label the _LOCATION_ complex and/or its derivatives in by cells . we found colocalization of some but not all _METHOD_ labeled speckles with the _LOCATION_ marker indicating that some of the speckles are related to elements in the _LOCATION_ pathway . secondary _METHOD_ are responsible for the emergence of _PROTEIN_ roots from root zone b . figure shows a section of a _PROTEIN_ root emerged from the _PROTEIN_ root . cells at the tip of the _PROTEIN_ root show _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at the ne indistinguishable from the pattern at the primary meristem . by contrast differentiated cells in zone b of the primary root as well as older cells of the _PROTEIN_ root show diffuse _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm . to verify that the different localization patterns of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are not simply because of an increasing accumulation of the fusion protein which would eventually obscure the signal at the _LOCATION_ rim we compared the _METHOD_ fusion protein accumulation in zone a and zone b by immunoblot analysis . figure shows that equivalent amounts of _METHOD_ fusion protein per total cellular protein are present in both zones . differentiated plant cells can be induced to dedifferentiate and reenter the cell cycle by hormone treatments . root explants from zone b of d old _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and free _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants were placed on callus induction medium . cells in developing calli were imaged and d after transfer to callus induction medium . at all three stages _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ associated with the ne in callus cells again correlating with the dividing dedifferentiated state of the cells . no change occurred in the localization pattern of free _METHOD_ . figure shows cells counterstained with propidium iodide to confirm the location of the _LOCATION_ . the previously described localization of tomato _PROTEIN_ in tobacco by cells was only investigated at the light microscopy level . therefore it was not known if _PROTEIN_ is associated with the inner or outer surface of the ne or both . here we have investigated by transmission electron microscopy immunolocalizations the precise subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ . antisera against _METHOD_ were used to localize _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in d old callus tissue induced from transgenic _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ arabidopsis roots . figures and show an example of an immunogold labeled section with the _LOCATION_ containing the nucleolus and the ne . in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ clusters of two or more gold particles were found primarily at the _LOCATION_ rim and predominantly associated with the cytoplasmic side of the ne in the vicinity of _LOCATION_ pores . the bar graph in figure quantifies the distribution of gold particles at the ne level which was calculated by counting gold particles from _LOCATION_ of three independent experiments . few lone gold particles or doublets were found at the level of the _LOCATION_ rim in control _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ callus cells but they were distributed equally at both sides of the ne and single gold particles and doublets were also found in the cytoplasm of both _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cells . samples treated with preimmune rabbit serum did not show any labeling . a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic tobacco by cell line was created to visualize _PROTEIN_ localization during cell division . this transgenic line also contained a microtubule binding domain dsred marker to visualize microtubules during cell division . figure shows images collected at different time points during cell division in this cell line . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ marker accumulates at the ne during preprophase and also shows a faint but consistent localization at the preprophase band site . upon ne breakdown and the onset of metaphase _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ intrudes into the spindle apparatus and the surrounding cytoplasm . _PROTEIN_ during anaphase this marker shows preferential localization to the midzone and is incorporated to those regions of the nascent cell plate where vesicle activity is highest . this accumulation is transient and is not seen in more developed areas of the cell plate . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ repartitions to the reforming nes during telophase where it persists at the end of cytokinesis . to investigate the loss of function phenotype of wpp family members rnai _PROTEIN_ transgenic arabidopsis plants were created . several lines were recovered that showed no detectable protein accumulation . separate lines were constructed with _PROTEIN_ rnai _PROTEIN_ rnai and _PROTEIN_ rnai constructs . however subsequent analysis of the lines by gene specific rt pcr showed that all three constructs were capable of silencing the _PROTEIN_ of all three genes . plants grown on vertical _METHOD_ agar plates developed a significantly shorter primary root compared with plants transformed with the empty vector . figure shows the average length of primary roots from d old light grown seedlings . figure shows a typical seedling from line compared with the vector control . no other features of the plant such as hypocotyl length shoot size leaf number leaf size or flowering time were significantly affected in the rnai lines . to test whether the short root phenotype was caused by reduced cell elongation length and width of root cells were measured . no noticeable cell size differences were detected between the vector control and rnai lines in root zones a and b . figure shows that the number of _PROTEIN_ roots was also reduced in d old light grown seedlings . this is evident in figure which shows the shortest vector control root placed next to the longest root from rnai line . it is apparent that the rnai line has fewer _PROTEIN_ roots compared with the vector control root of a comparable developmental stage . similarly shorter roots and fewer _PROTEIN_ roots were also observed in _PROTEIN_ antisense lines . to examine mitotic activity in rnai lines we transformed transgenic arabidopsis plants containing a _PROTEIN_ fusion gene with the _PROTEIN_ rnai construct . because of a mitotic degradation signal in the protein the reporter gene activity is seen only in actively dividing cells . the number of cells undergoing mitosis as visualized by the gus staining is reduced from in wild type roots to in rnai line and in rnai line . figure shows representative images of a wild type root tip next to a root tip of rnai line .
