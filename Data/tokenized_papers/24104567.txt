_LOCATION_ provide plants with metabolic pathways that are unique among eukaryotes including the methylerythritol phosphate pathway for the production of isoprenoids essential for photosynthesis and plant growth . here we show that the first enzyme of the pathway deoxyxylulose phosphate synthase _PROTEIN_ interacts with the j protein _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis thaliana . j proteins typically act as _PROTEIN_ that provide substrate specificity to heat shock protein _PROTEIN_ a molecular chaperone . immunoprecipitation experiments showed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are found together in vivo and confirmed the presence of _PROTEIN_ chaperones in _PROTEIN_ complexes . mutants defective in _PROTEIN_ activity accumulated significantly increased levels of _PROTEIN_ protein and displayed reduced levels of _PROTEIN_ enzyme activity indicating that loss of _PROTEIN_ function causes posttranscriptional accumulation of _PROTEIN_ in an inactive form . furthermore _PROTEIN_ promotes degradation of _PROTEIN_ following a heat shock . together our data indicate that _PROTEIN_ might identify unfolded or misfolded _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ and target them to the _PROTEIN_ system for proper folding under normal conditions or degradation upon stress .
posttranscriptional regulation is a major _PROTEIN_ determining the levels of active _PROTEIN_ the first enzyme of the mep pathway . to identify protein partners that could posttranslationally modulate _PROTEIN_ activity in arabidopsis we performed yeast two hybrid screening . among the possible _PROTEIN_ partners identified only four proteins were calculated to be interactors with high or very high confidence . of the three category b proteins only one of them might localize to _LOCATION_ but its function is unknown . here we report our work with the only category a protein identified _PROTEIN_ also named and . _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ localized j protein that was proposed to contribute to photosynthetic efficiency . the ability of _PROTEIN_ to bind to _PROTEIN_ was confirmed in vitro by pull down assays . bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation experiments using leek epidermal cells further showed that in plant cells these two proteins interacted in _LOCATION_ . to confirm that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were part of the same complex in arabidopsis we performed immunoprecipitation experiments using transgenic plants constitutively _PROTEIN_ a green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged version of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . untransformed plants and transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ a _METHOD_ fused _PROTEIN_ enzyme _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ were also used for immunoprecipitation experiments with both anti _METHOD_ and preimmune sera . _PROTEIN_ was detected only in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ samples immunoprecipitated with the anti _METHOD_ antibody despite the very low level of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein detected in the input samples . taken together these data show that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ can efficiently interact in vivo . extensive work performed _PROTEIN_ in nonplant _METHOD_ has previously demonstrated that j proteins like _PROTEIN_ typically act as _PROTEIN_ that recognize and deliver protein substrates to _PROTEIN_ a molecular chaperone highly conserved in plants . the j domain responsible for the interaction with _PROTEIN_ is well conserved in _PROTEIN_ including the his pro asp tripeptide required for interaction with the chaperone . upon interaction _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis is stimulated to transfer the protein substrate to the _PROTEIN_ chaperone and to drive conformational changes . to test the prediction that _PROTEIN_ might target _PROTEIN_ to the _PROTEIN_ chaperone transgenic arabidopsis plants overexpressing a _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ enzyme _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were used to immunoprecipitate _PROTEIN_ containing complexes using an anti _METHOD_ serum . immunoblot analysis with an antibody specific for chloroplast _PROTEIN_ proteins showed that these chaperones were indeed present in the immunoprecipitated samples confirming that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ can be found together in vivo . to understand the biological relevance of the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ we next analyzed whether plants defective in _PROTEIN_ had any _PROTEIN_ related phenotype . changes in _PROTEIN_ activity cause altered sensitivity to clomazone _PROTEIN_ a specific _PROTEIN_ inhibitor . in arabidopsis germination and growth in the presence of _PROTEIN_ result in concentration dependent bleaching and a concomitant inhibition of true leaf development likely due to a reduced production of _LOCATION_ isoprenoid products such as chlorophylls carotenoids and mep derived hormones . plants with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ activity such as the dxs mutant showed lower resistance to _PROTEIN_ than the wild type whereas _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines displayed reduced sensitivity to the inhibitor . because a good correlation exists between _PROTEIN_ sensitivity and total _PROTEIN_ activity in arabidopsis we used this _PROTEIN_ assay to evaluate whether the loss of _PROTEIN_ function resulted in altered _PROTEIN_ activity . we first analyzed the syngenta arabidopsis insertion library line harboring a t dna insertion in the first exon of _PROTEIN_ here referred to as . wild type and plants were germinated and grown on murashige and skoog _METHOD_ plates supplemented with different concentrations of the inhibitor . the visual phenotype of the mutant at a given concentration of _PROTEIN_ was similar to that of wild type seedlings grown in the presence of higher concentrations of the inhibitor indicating that the loss of _PROTEIN_ activity causes an increased sensitivity to _PROTEIN_ . quantification of _PROTEIN_ sensitivity by measuring chlorophyll levels in _PROTEIN_ treated plants led to the same conclusion . measurement of _PROTEIN_ activity in wild type and seedlings confirmed that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ resistance phenotype of the mutant was caused by a substantial reduction in _PROTEIN_ activity . because determining _PROTEIN_ activity in plant extracts is complicated from this point we only used the _PROTEIN_ sensitivity assay to estimate _PROTEIN_ activity in vivo . two independent lines of evidence confirmed that the phenotype of the mutant line was specifically caused by the loss of _PROTEIN_ activity . first independent t dna insertion alleles from the syngenta arabidopsis insertion library and the salk collections herein referred to as and also showed _PROTEIN_ sensitivity . second transformation of plants with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct complemented the _PROTEIN_ sensitivity phenotype of the mutant . there are more than j domain proteins in arabidopsis and several of them are targeted to _LOCATION_ . however sequence analyses showed that _PROTEIN_ is more similar to j proteins of other plant species than to the closest arabidopsis j domain proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and . arabidopsis mutants impaired in _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ did not show the characteristic _PROTEIN_ sensitivity phenotype observed in _PROTEIN_ defective plants . because the similarity between _PROTEIN_ and other _LOCATION_ j proteins from arabidopsis including _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is much lower at the c terminal domain which provides substrate specificity it is likely that this domain might confer specificity on _PROTEIN_ allowing it to interact with _PROTEIN_ to deliver the protein to the _PROTEIN_ chaperone . two _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ chaperones and are found in arabidopsis . if _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are part of the same mechanism regulating _PROTEIN_ activity it should follow that mutants defective in _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ activity also show a phenotype of higher sensitivity to _PROTEIN_ . since mutants defective in both and are not viable we analyzed single mutant lines . as shown in figure both single mutants showed a phenotype of increased _PROTEIN_ sensitivity relative to the wild type although this phenotype was stronger in the case of the mutant . these results together demonstrate that loss of _PROTEIN_ function leads to reduced _PROTEIN_ activity _PROTEIN_ in vivo most likely because it impairs targeting of this enzyme to the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ chaperone system . _PROTEIN_ chaperones participate in protein import into organelles _LOCATION_ protein folding and assembly and protein quality control . if _PROTEIN_ activity is required for the import of _PROTEIN_ into _LOCATION_ the _PROTEIN_ in enzyme activity observed in plants might be a result of reduced _PROTEIN_ protein levels in _LOCATION_ . to address this possibility _PROTEIN_ levels were analyzed in chloroplasts isolated from wild type and mutant plants . strikingly immunoblot experiments with an anti _PROTEIN_ antibody showed not _PROTEIN_ but increased levels of _PROTEIN_ protein in mutant chloroplasts . this result suggests that loss of _PROTEIN_ function impairs processes occurring after the import of _PROTEIN_ resulting in the accumulation of inactive _PROTEIN_ protein in _LOCATION_ . consistent with this the levels of _PROTEIN_ protein in total protein extracts of plants were threefold higher than those in the wild type without changes in the levels of _PROTEIN_ encoding transcripts . although previous results have shown that posttranscriptional _METHOD_ regulating the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ protein can also affect the levels of _PROTEIN_ the next enzyme of the mep pathway the amount of _PROTEIN_ protein detected in the same protein extracts showed no differences between mutant and wild type plants . in agreement with the presence of similar levels of _PROTEIN_ activity in wild type and plants no differences were observed in their sensitivity to the _PROTEIN_ specific inhibitor fosmidomycin . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is not involved in regulating _PROTEIN_ levels or activity . neither _PROTEIN_ nor _PROTEIN_ levels changed when the activity of close _PROTEIN_ related j proteins such as _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ was disrupted in mutants . to provide additional experimental support to the conclusion that defective _PROTEIN_ activity results in posttranscriptional accumulation of inactive _PROTEIN_ protein inside chloroplasts a transgenic _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line generated in the wild type ecotype columbia was selected to introgress the transgene into the background . after the cross siblings that were double homozygous for the transgene and either the wild type or the mutant _PROTEIN_ gene were selected . in agreement with the results described above confocal laser scanning microscopy of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ showed that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein was localized to chloroplasts of siblings with either wild type or mutant _PROTEIN_ genes but the levels were much higher in mutant _LOCATION_ . interestingly a spotted pattern of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in both types of siblings even though spots were much larger in the case of the mutant . this might be caused by the formation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ aggregates although we can not exclude other possibilities such as the accumulation of the transgenic protein in subplastidial structures . such aggregates would most likely contain _PROTEIN_ in an inactive form because transgenic siblings of the background showed reduced resistance to _PROTEIN_ despite accumulating increased levels of constitutively _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein compared with siblings with functional _PROTEIN_ protein . the results described above suggest that under normal growth conditions _PROTEIN_ prevents the accumulation of inactive _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ in chloroplasts . if the _PROTEIN_ role of _PROTEIN_ is to identify non native _PROTEIN_ polypeptides and deliver them to _PROTEIN_ for proper folding or refolding it could be expected that upregulating _PROTEIN_ levels would result in improved _PROTEIN_ activity . however the presence of increasing levels of a functional _METHOD_ tagged version of _PROTEIN_ in different _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines led to reduced _PROTEIN_ levels and a bleached phenotype . transgenic lines with highest _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ levels showed an albino phenotype similar to that of the _PROTEIN_ defective dxs mutant . despite this dramatic phenotypic effect no major changes in the levels of other proteins like _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were detected in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines relative to wild type or mutant dxs plants . these results suggest that abnormally high levels of _PROTEIN_ prevent the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ polypeptides without altering the levels of other _LOCATION_ proteins . to evaluate whether _PROTEIN_ might contribute to degrade _PROTEIN_ polypeptides that could be damaged following environmental stress plants growing at were transferred to and samples were collected at different times after the heat shock for immunoblot analysis of _PROTEIN_ protein levels . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ was rapidly degraded after the heat shock in the wild type whereas the degradation rate was slower in mutant plants . by contrast _PROTEIN_ was more stable after a heat shock and its levels remained similar in wild type and plants . the levels of _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ proteins also remained unchanged in wild type and mutant plants during this period supporting the conclusion that the rate of _PROTEIN_ degradation depends on the levels of _PROTEIN_ but not of _PROTEIN_ chaperones . together our data suggest that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ might promote degradation of _PROTEIN_ proteins that are damaged and hence inactivated after a heat stress episode .
