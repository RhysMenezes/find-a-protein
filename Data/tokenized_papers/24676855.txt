the phytohormone abscisic acid is crucial for plant growth and _PROTEIN_ responses to various stress conditions . plants continuously adjust the aba level to meet physiological needs but how aba homeostasis occurs is not fully understood . this study provides evidence that _PROTEIN_ an aba uridine diphosphate _PROTEIN_ and its two closely related homologs and _PROTEIN_ play crucial roles in aba homeostasis and in _PROTEIN_ to dehydration osmotic stress and high salinity stresses in arabidopsis . ugt rna interference plants that had low levels of these three ugt transcripts displayed hypersensitivity to exogenous aba and high salt conditions during germination and exhibited a defect in plant growth . however the ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant background aggravated the aba deficient phenotype of _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . in addition modulation of the _PROTEIN_ of the three ugts affects the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ which encode aba hydroxylases four were _PROTEIN_ at higher levels in the ugt rna interference plants but at lower levels in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overexpressing plants . based on these data this study proposes that _PROTEIN_ and its two homologs play a critical role in aba homeostasis by converting active aba to an inactive form _PROTEIN_ depending on intrinsic cellular and environmental conditions in plants .
arabidopsis ugts represent a superfamily containing more than homologs . phylogenetic analysis reveals that the arabidopsis ugt superfamily can be divided into distinct subgroups . _PROTEIN_ is located in group e. two additional ugt homologs that are in group e with _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ have more than amino acid sequence similarity to _PROTEIN_ and are located immediately upstream and downstream of _PROTEIN_ on chromosome respectively . thus _GENE_ and _GENE_ were named and _PROTEIN_ respectively . to test whether and _PROTEIN_ have similar functions to _PROTEIN_ with respect to inactivation of aba we examined the effect of these genes on the _PROTEIN_ of an aba responsive gene using protoplasts derived from wild type arabidopsis . first we established how _PROTEIN_ affects the _PROTEIN_ of aba responsive genes in protoplasts . for this experiment we produced a fusion construct containing the firefly luciferase reporter driven by the aba responsive _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ . a second construct containing _PROTEIN_ tagged with _METHOD_ at the c terminus or containing only _METHOD_ as a control was used as an effector . the luc and _PROTEIN_ constructs were cotransformed into protoplasts or luc and _METHOD_ control and the transcript level of luc was determined by quantitative real time pcr . the luc transcripts were significantly reduced when cotransformed with _PROTEIN_ compared with that for the cotransformation of luc with _METHOD_ as a control effector . these results confirm that _PROTEIN_ reduces cellular aba levels . next we examined the effect of the two ugt homologs and _PROTEIN_ on the _PROTEIN_ of luc . when _METHOD_ tagged _METHOD_ of and _PROTEIN_ were cotransformed with _PROTEIN_ luc they suppressed the _PROTEIN_ of luc as was observed for cotransformation with _PROTEIN_ . however an unrelated ugt _PROTEIN_ which belongs to group d did not show any noticeable effect on the _PROTEIN_ of luc when the _METHOD_ tagged form of _PROTEIN_ was cotransformed into protoplasts with _PROTEIN_ luc . these results indicate that and _PROTEIN_ reduce the aba levels similar to that observed for _PROTEIN_ thereby resulting in the suppression of _PROTEIN_ luc . in addition these results suggest that the c terminal _METHOD_ moiety did not affect the activity of ugts . these results prompted us to examine if these genes play a role in osmotic stress responses . therefore we examined their gene _PROTEIN_ under osmotic stress conditions . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is induced under high osmotic stress conditions and by the application of exogenous aba . to test whether the _PROTEIN_ of and _PROTEIN_ is regulated under these conditions week old wild type plants were treated with aba mm nacl or mm mannitol for h and total rna from these plants was used for qrt pcr analysis . _PROTEIN_ was included as a positive control . the transcript levels of these three ugt homologs were rapidly induced by aba nacl and mannitol treatments albeit at different levels . these results indicate that and _PROTEIN_ are involved in the osmotic stress response . next we examined the spatial _PROTEIN_ patterns of these three ugt homologs . to quantify the _PROTEIN_ level total rna was prepared from rosettes cauline leaves _METHOD_ flowers siliques and roots of wild type plants and subjected to qrt pcr analysis . _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ at high levels in rosette and cauline leaves at low levels in _METHOD_ flowers and siliques and essentially no _PROTEIN_ was detected in root tissues . was _PROTEIN_ at high levels in rosette and cauline leaves flowers and siliques at low levels in _METHOD_ and essentially no _PROTEIN_ was detected in roots . by contrast _PROTEIN_ was strongly _PROTEIN_ only in siliques with a low level of _PROTEIN_ in flowers . these results indicate that the three ugts showed different spatial and tissue specific _PROTEIN_ patterns . in addition we also examined the spatial _PROTEIN_ patterns of three ugt homologs upon abiotic stresses using transgenic plants harboring the ugt promoter gus constructs . the promoter regions of three ugts were placed upstream of the gus coding region and transgenic plants harboring these constructs were generated . two week old _PROTEIN_ gus gus and _PROTEIN_ gus seedlings were treated with aba or dehydration stress for h. the gus _PROTEIN_ in rosette leaves of all three transgenic plants was higher under both aba and dehydration stress conditions than under the no stress condition suggesting that all three ugts are involved in the osmotic stress and drought responses which is consistent with the data shown in figure . to obtain insight into the physiological roles of ugt homologs at the cellular level we examined their subcellular localizations . we generated transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the three ugts tagged with _METHOD_ at the c terminus under the control of the promoter . the localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was examined in protoplasts isolated from these transgenic plants . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of all three fusion proteins was observed as a diffuse pattern indicating that they are localized in the _LOCATION_ . to verify this result protein extracts from transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were separated into soluble and _LOCATION_ fractions by ultracentrifugation and the fractions were analyzed by western blotting using anti _METHOD_ antibody . all three ugts were detected in soluble fractions which _METHOD_ their _LOCATION_ localization . as a control for the soluble fractionation arabidopsis aleurain like protein _PROTEIN_ was detected with anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . it was specifically detected in the soluble fraction confirming the fractionation . a previous work showed that _PROTEIN_ loss of function mutant plants did not display any noticeable phenotype . when we examined single knockout mutants of or _PROTEIN_ they did not show any noticeable phenotype . one possible explanation is a functional redundancy among these three ugts . it may be necessary to generate double or triple ugt mutants to observe any noticeable phenotype . however the tandem localization of the three genes on chromosome makes it difficult to generate the double or triple knockout mutant plants . as an alternative approach we generated inducible ugt rna interference transgenic plants using a bp fragment of the highly conserved region under the control of the dexamethasone inducible promoter . ugt rnai transgenic plants were generated in the wild type background we obtained independent lines at the generation . in ugt rnai line and ugt rnai line the transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ used as a control were greatly reduced when detected by qrt pcr . when continuously exposed to dex ugt rnai transgenic plants showed multiple phenotypes such as smaller rosette leaves shorter roots and pale green leaves . these phenotypes were observed only in ugt rnai plants but not in pta control plants confirming that these phenotypes are caused by the suppression of the three ugts . glc conjugation to the _PROTEIN_ group of aba is one of the two catabolic pathways that lower aba levels . we determined whether knockdown of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ affects aba responses . in these experiments vector control rnai and rnai seeds were planted on one half strength murashige and skoog _METHOD_ plates supplemented with dex and the germination rate was determined at varying time points . at d after planting the germination rate of vc seeds was more than whereas the germination rate of the two independent rnai seeds was less than . when the germination rate was examined on a plate supplemented with aba or mm nacl in the presence of dex the seed germination rate was reduced further at d after planting rnai seeds treated with mm nacl barely produced any green cotyledons compared with the control seeds which showed cotyledon greening . one possible explanation is that the cellular aba levels are higher in rnai seeds than in vc seeds . next we examined the aba related developmental phenotype of rnai plants at postgermination stages under different abiotic stress conditions . transgenic plants of two independent rnai and vc lines grown on _METHOD_ plates for d were transplanted onto _METHOD_ plates containing dex together with aba or mm mannitol . at weeks after transplantation plant growth was measured by the primary root length and fresh weight . the growth rate of rnai transgenic plants was greatly reduced in the presence of exogenous aba compared with that of the vc plants . moreover rnai transgenic plants showed higher resistance to mannitol than vc plants . these results indicate that ugt rnai transgenic plants are hypersensitive to exogenous aba and display enhanced resistance to osmotic stress . next to assess whether the suppression of all three ugts has any effect on the dehydration stress response we measured the relative water loss . the aerial parts of vc and rnai plants were excised and the rate of water loss was examined under dehydration conditions . rnai plants lost water more slowly than vc plants confirming that rnai plants are more resistant to dehydration stress . to gain insight into the underlying cause of the aba hypersensitive phenotype we examined whether the mode of aba signaling was affected in rnai transgenic plants . total rna was isolated from d old rnai transgenic plants grown in the presence or absence of dex for h and the _PROTEIN_ of the aba responsive genes responsive to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cold _PROTEIN_ and responsive to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the cytokinin responsive genes type a responsive _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as negative controls was examined by qrt pcr . the dex treatment increased the transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ by more than fold whereas the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was not altered . these results confirm that aba mediated signaling is specifically activated in ugt rnai plants . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overexpressing transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ cause no noticeable aba deficient phenotype or only a weakly deficient phenotype despite the _PROTEIN_ that _PROTEIN_ can lower the cellular aba level by converting aba to aba ge . similar to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants both _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants did not display any noticeable alteration in osmotic and dehydration stress responses compared with wild type plants except an increase in cotyledon greening in the presence of glc indicating that overexpression of ugts has a minor effect on aba levels . recent work shows that two _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which localize to the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ respectively can hydrolyze aba ge to aba . we questioned if _PROTEIN_ and/or _PROTEIN_ were involved in the lack of an apparent aba deficient phenotype in the _PROTEIN_ overexpressing transgenic plants . one possible scenario is that hydrolysis of aba ge to aba by these two _PROTEIN_ may compensate for the _PROTEIN_ mediated reduction in aba levels . to test this we introduced _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ into _PROTEIN_ mutant plants and examined their phenotype . under normal growth conditions transgenic plants of two independent lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed a significantly higher germination rate than _PROTEIN_ or wild type plants . the higher germination rate of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants was more prominent in the presence of or mm nacl . similarly _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants had significantly higher germination rates than _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants in the presence of aba indicating that the transgenic plants have lower levels of aba . one possible explanation is that _PROTEIN_ overexpression causes a reduction of the cellular aba level . these results also support the hypothesis that two opposing pathways conjugation of glc to aba by _PROTEIN_ and hydrolysis of aba ge to aba by _PROTEIN_ and/or _PROTEIN_ contribute to the homeostasis of cellular aba levels . to gain further insight into the physiological roles of _PROTEIN_ the aerial parts of wild type _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants were excised and the rate of water loss was examined under dehydration conditions . as observed previously _PROTEIN_ plants displayed an increased rate of water loss compared with wild type and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants . the rate of water loss in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mutant plants was higher than that in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ plants and appeared to be equivalent to the additive effects of both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ plants . this indicates that _PROTEIN_ overexpression causes an additional reduction of aba levels in the _PROTEIN_ background . to confirm this result we grew wild type _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants for weeks on soil under normal growth conditions kept the plants in a greenhouse without watering for d and then started watering again . the survival rate was determined at d after the start of rewatering . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants were the most sensitive to dehydration stress followed by _PROTEIN_ plants indicating that _PROTEIN_ plays an important role in the cellular response to dehydration stress . to gain further insight into the function of _PROTEIN_ in osmotic stress responses the _PROTEIN_ of osmotic stress inducible genes was examined in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plant . total rna from wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants that had been treated with or without mm mannitol for h was used for qrt pcr analysis . _PROTEIN_ mutant plants were included as a positive control . in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants the induction of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ by mm mannitol was delayed compared with that in the _PROTEIN_ plants which in turn was delayed compared with the _PROTEIN_ in wild type plants . these results indicate that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ inhibits the _PROTEIN_ of osmotic stress inducible genes under high osmotic stress conditions . this occurs through a _PROTEIN_ mediated reduction of the cellular aba levels . to examine the effect of _PROTEIN_ overexpression on aba levels in plants the aba content was measured by elisa using an anti aba antibody . wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ vc and rnai plants were grown on _METHOD_ plates supplemented with or without dex . _PROTEIN_ mutant plants were included as a control . consistent with the published results aba contents in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings were essentially the same under the no stress condition . however the aba content of dex treated rnai plants was that of the dex treated vc plants whereas the aba contents of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants were only and that of the wild type respectively . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ play important roles to reduce the cellular aba level . these results are consistent with the phenotypes of these plants . the cellular aba levels in plants are also reduced by the hydroxylation pathway . to gain insight into possible interactions between hydroxylation and conjugation catabolic pathways we examined whether modulation of the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ affects the _PROTEIN_ of four genes _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ which are involved in the hydroxylation of aba . vc and rnai plants grown on _METHOD_ plates supplemented with dex were treated for h with or without dehydration stress and total rna from these plants was used for qrt pcr analysis of the four . the transcript levels of all four were significantly higher in rnai compared with vc plants both with and without dehydration stress . similarly upon treatment with salt and osmotic stress the transcript levels of all four were remarkably higher in rnai than in vc plants both with or without stress treatment . these results indicate that suppression of ugt _PROTEIN_ induces the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ which functions to compensate for the loss of the ugt mediated catabolic pathway . next we examined the transcript levels of the four in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants after treatment for h with or without dehydration stress . the transcript levels of the four were strongly reduced in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants . similar results were obtained with salt and osmotic stress treatments indicating that strong _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ suppresses . these results raised the possibility that a regulatory circuit exists to coordinate the opposing _PROTEIN_ of genes involved in the two aba catabolic pathways .
