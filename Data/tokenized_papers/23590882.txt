molecular genetic and electrophysiological evidence indicates that at least one of the plant glu receptor like molecules _PROTEIN_ functions as an amino acid gated channel at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the aspect of plant physiology growth or development to which _PROTEIN_ contributes is an open question . protein localization studies performed here provide important information . in roots _PROTEIN_ and the related _PROTEIN_ protein were present primarily in the phloem especially in the vicinity of the sieve plates . _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in most cells of the growing primary root but was not enriched in the phloem including the sieve plate area . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ physically interacted with each other better than with _METHOD_ as evidenced by a biophotonic assay performed in human embryonic kidney cells and nicotiana benthamiana leaf cells . _PROTEIN_ interacted poorly with itself or the other two glrs . mutations in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ caused the same and equally severe phenotype namely a large overproduction and aberrant placement of _PROTEIN_ root primordia . loss of _PROTEIN_ did not affect _PROTEIN_ root primordia . these results support the hypothesis that apoplastic amino acids acting through heteromeric _PROTEIN_ channels affect _PROTEIN_ root development via signaling in the phloem .
according to promoter strength and mrna analyses at least five of the seven genes comprising the clade to which _PROTEIN_ belongs are _PROTEIN_ at much higher levels in roots than shoots . this localization information was refined by visualizing the localizations of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ each fusion being _PROTEIN_ in the respective glr knockout mutant and under the control of its native promoter . confocal microscopy confirmed _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ protein in roots . despite the low _METHOD_ signal originating from the center of the root specific _PROTEIN_ patterns could be resolved . they compared very favorably with published tissue specific transcriptome data . the arabidopsis thaliana _METHOD_ browser tool indicated _PROTEIN_ mrna to be fold more abundant in the phloem than any other tissue or cell type in roots . a transcriptome analysis that distinguished different developmental stages of phloem showed _PROTEIN_ mrna to be eightfold higher in the protophloem near the root apex than in mature phloem . these mrna patterns closely matched the _PROTEIN_ protein patterns visualized by confocal microscopy _PROTEIN_ . the images shown were difficult to obtain because signal intensity was not high and because the majority of _PROTEIN_ was restricted to one tissue comprising a minor fraction of the deepest region of the root . nonetheless the live cell visualization results contained an additional potentially important result . special concentrations occurred in spots spaced apart along the mature phloem cell files readily apparent in the _PROTEIN_ example shown . when hand cut root cross sections contained these special locations of high signal intensity the spots were observed at positions consistent with phloem and they overlapped with locales of aniline blue staining considered diagnostic of the callose that accumulates at specialized cell cell contact points in sieve tube members known as sieve plates . the next clue about _PROTEIN_ function in roots came from a machine learning analysis of transcriptome patterns . _PROTEIN_ was among the genes predicted to play a role in _PROTEIN_ root initiation . microscopy inspection of _PROTEIN_ mutants showed they produced twice as many _PROTEIN_ root primordia as the wild type though the number of emerged _PROTEIN_ roots and therefore the overt root system architecture was not affected . the _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ used to visualize the _PROTEIN_ pattern rescued this phenotype . the related _PROTEIN_ gene was included in the same transcript behavior cluster as _PROTEIN_ . the arabidopsis _METHOD_ browser tool showed _PROTEIN_ mrna to be fold more abundant in the phloem of roots than in the adjacent tissues and cell types and fold enriched in the protophloem compared with mature phloem again consistent with the observed protein localization . like _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ accumulated at sieve plates . in agreement with this correlated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants also hyperproduced _PROTEIN_ root primordia . the related _PROTEIN_ should be _PROTEIN_ generally in the root apex according to the citation _PROTEIN_ atlas . indeed the protein was evident in all cell types of the growth zone consistent with the root gravitropism phenotype determined by computational image analysis . _PROTEIN_ displayed some tendency to accumulate in the phloem in the mature region of the root but it did not accumulate at sieve plates and it was not predicted to play a role in _PROTEIN_ root initiation on the basis of its spatiotemporal mrna patterns . accordingly two independent _PROTEIN_ alleles did not differ from the wild type with respect to production of _PROTEIN_ root primordia . each primordium and _PROTEIN_ root counted in figure was also classified as early _PROTEIN_ emerged or elongated . the results presented in table show that the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ phenotypes were due mostly to extra early stage root primordia but the higher rate of initiation was offset by a higher rate of subsequent arrest . in addition _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations affected primordium positioning . the wild type typically initiated successive primordia on alternate sides of the root but the mutants typically did not . the location of each detected primordium was mapped onto a macroscopic image of the same root as shown by the black arrowheads in figure . white arrowheads indicate emerged _PROTEIN_ roots that are not visible in the macroscopic image . this display method shows the much higher density of _PROTEIN_ root primordia in representative single and double mutant roots relative to the wild type as well as the high incidence of successive primordia produced on the same side of the root . light micrographs show wild type and mutant primordia to be anatomically similar . also shown is an example of successive primordia located on the same side of a _PROTEIN_ root . the strong similarities in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ localization patterns and their similar knockout phenotypes raised the possibility that these two receptors could function together possibly as subunits of the same tetrameric channel . if so the double mutant phenotype would be expected to display a phenotype similar to either single mutant rather than an additive defect . microscopy inspection of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants produced data in support of this _PROTEIN_ heteromeric hypothesis . the double mutant hyperproduced _PROTEIN_ root primordia indistinguishably from the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutants . loss of one subunit from the presumed heterotetramer produced the same phenotype as loss of the other loss of both was no worse . these genetic results are consistent with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ subunits forming a heteromeric channel in the phloem that functions in the production of _PROTEIN_ root primordia . a phenomenon known as resonance energy transfer can occur between excited cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ if the two are not more than nm apart a distance consistent with a physical interaction . _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ was fused to the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ and then _PROTEIN_ in hek cells where _METHOD_ was observed at the cell periphery with a confocal laser scanning microscope . to test for fret between one glr fused to _METHOD_ and the same or a different glr fused to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ from the donor within a region of interest including the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was measured before and after photobleaching of the acceptor in coexpressing cells . the relative increase in _METHOD_ _METHOD_ after photobleaching was quantified to determine the fret efficiency values shown in figure . fret did not occur between free _METHOD_ and free _METHOD_ as expected . substantial amounts of fret occurred between identical glrs as expected at least for _PROTEIN_ given the previously published evidence of channel activity from _PROTEIN_ homomers . _PROTEIN_ showed very little or no fret with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . by contrast fret efficiency between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was high similar to that observed between aquaporin subunits that interact to form water channels . the _PROTEIN_ signal was greater than either homomeric signal to a degree that is highly significant indicating a preference for heteromerization . transient _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaf cells produced essentially the same degree of fret as observed in hek cells greatly reducing concerns about physiological relevance that sometimes accompany results obtained with heterologous _METHOD_ . the _PROTEIN_ that two subunits displaying a high fret efficiency show a similar subcellular localization pattern in phloem along with their equivalent and nonadditive mutant phenotypes leads to the conclusion that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are components of heteromeric amino acid gated channels in the phloem . patch clamp electrophysiology assays for _PROTEIN_ channel function in transfected hek cells did not produce positive results . _PROTEIN_ homomers may not form functional channels in the hek cell due to the lack of some important _PROTEIN_ or the amino acids tested are not effective agonists for _PROTEIN_ . lack of information about homomeric _PROTEIN_ channel activity left open the question of what activity to expect from _PROTEIN_ heteromeric channels predicted to form based on the fret results in figure when coexpressed in hek cells . current voltage analysis of asn gated currents in _PROTEIN_ coexpressing cells were performed with the patch clamp technique as previously described . the expectation was that any such currents would reflect the activity of _PROTEIN_ heteromers because the fret studies and genetics indicated that these two subunits interacted . the slopes of the difference i v curves and their zero current voltages which indicate large selectivity for of the asn gated current were essentially the same as those previously obtained for _PROTEIN_ alone . the small differences between the two curves could be due to different levels of _PROTEIN_ heteromerization with _PROTEIN_ did not have a large effect on the asn induced activity of _PROTEIN_ in these conditions . however differences in properties not yet tested such as a comprehensive agonist profile or kinetic properties remain possible . another possible explanation of why coexpressing _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ did not create a substantially new activity is that the only functional channels produced in the coexpressing cells were _PROTEIN_ homomers formed from subunits that failed to partner with _PROTEIN_ subunits . an interesting possibility not supported by the coexpression experiment is that the phenomenon of glr desensitization so apparent in planta but apparently absent in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ hek cells is an emergent property of native heteromers . asn activated _PROTEIN_ currents were sustained _PROTEIN_ steady state during agonist presentation as in cells _PROTEIN_ only _PROTEIN_ . otherwise the analysis shown in figure would not have been possible because the currents in figure are the difference between steady state currents recorded before and after asn . some _PROTEIN_ in the plant is apparently required for desensitization possibly a third glr to join _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the tetramer .
seeds of arabidopsis thaliana were surface sterilized and sown on petri plates containing medium diluted fold and supplemented with suc and mm mes adjusted to ph with naoh and gelled with agarose . the plates with seeds were _PROTEIN_ at for to d before being placed vertically in a growth chamber under constant light . after d of growth seedlings were transferred to mm petri plates containing

live at room temperature in hank s balanced buffer solution without phenol . a zeiss lsm meta confocal imaging system with a mw argon laser and a numerical aperture oil immersion plan apochromat objective was used to visualize live cells or n. benthamiana epidermal cells coexpressing subunit pairs consisting of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or glr c terminally tagged with _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ as indicated in figure . fret was measured by acceptor photobleaching with the following modifications . prebleach _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ images were collected simultaneously following excitation at nm . a selected region of interest was irradiated with the nm laser line using a nm dual dichroic mirror for to s to photobleach _METHOD_ . postbleach _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ images were collected simultaneously immediately following photobleaching . _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were separated using online fingerprinting and linear unmixing with the zeiss meta detector and zeiss aim software as previously described . fret was measured as an increase in _METHOD_ _METHOD_ intensity following _METHOD_ photobleaching . fret efficiency was calculated as _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the fret ratios at all the pixels in a region of interest within the cell were averaged to quantify the interactions of the glr receptor subunits . whole cell patch clamping and current voltage analysis was performed as previously described . briefly cells were transfected with both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs . cells _PROTEIN_ both constructs were selected on an olympus upright fixed stage _METHOD_ microscope equipped with a dipping lens with an emission filter setup that allows simultaneous separation and imaging of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . whole cell patch clamp and current voltage analysis protocol was essentially the same as described by citation including both bath and pipette solutions except the bath solution contained mm instead of mm . the methods for analyzing the steady state currents before and after ligand to generate the difference i v curve shown in figure were exactly as described by citation . the zeiss confocal laser scanning microscope was used to visualize _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in roots stained with propidium iodide for min . optics employed were a plan apochromat lens or a c apochromat water immersion lens . the samples were excited with the nm laser line and channel mode detection was used to record the emission of enhanced _METHOD_ and propidium iodide . for sieve plate imaging root tissue was stripped of epidermal and cortical layers with fine tweezers to expose the central stele region and stained with aniline blue for min and visualized by _METHOD_ microscopy using a short wavelength emission filter set or enhanced
