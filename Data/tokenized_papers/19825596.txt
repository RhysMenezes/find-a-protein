sorting nexins are conserved proteins that function in vesicular trafficking and contain a characteristic phox homology domain . here we characterize the ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis thaliana sorting nexin . sub cellular fractionation studies indicate that is peripherally associated with _LOCATION_ . the px domain binds to phosphatidylinositol phosphate in vitro and this association is required for the localization of _METHOD_ to punctate structures in vivo identified as the trans _LOCATION_ network prevacuolar compartment and endosomes . overexpression of _METHOD_ tagged produces enlarged _METHOD_ labeled compartments that can also be labeled by the endocytic tracer . endocytic trafficking of to the _LOCATION_ is arrested in these _METHOD_ compartments and similar accumulating compartments are seen upon overexpression of untagged . this suggests that exit of _LOCATION_ components from these enlarged or aggregated endosomes is inhibited . _LOCATION_ proteins containing an n terminal propeptide but not those with a c terminal propeptide are also present in these enlarged compartments . we hypothesize that is involved in vesicular trafficking from endosomes to the _LOCATION_ .
three putative snxs have been identified in the model plant arabidopsis . here we focus on a potential snx based on amino acid similarity with yeast and human snxs with the majority of the similarity residing in the region of the px domain . of the arabidopsis sorting nexins is most similar to and shows much lower similarity to _PROTEIN_ . has two major domains an n terminal conserved px domain which defines a snx and a c terminal coiled coil region potentially important for protein protein interactions . to determine the _PROTEIN_ pattern of rna was extracted from different arabidopsis plant organs and rt pcr was performed using gene specific primers . shows that _PROTEIN_ can be detected in all of the plant organs tested including roots rosette leaves cauline leaves stem flowers and siliques suggesting that its function is important throughout the plant . for comparison the _PROTEIN_ pattern of was also determined . mrna was also detected throughout the plant although at lower levels in flowers siliques and senescing leaves . the overlapping _PROTEIN_ patterns of and raises the possibility that the two genes may also have overlapping functions . to analyze the protein antibodies were raised against recombinant . full length protein was synthesized in escherichia coli as a his tagged fusion protein and purified by affinity chromatography . the protein was injected into rabbits and the generated antibodies were affinity purified against the recombinant protein prior to use . immunoreactivity of the affinity purified antibodies was compared with that of the crude serum and preimmune serum by immunoblotting against the recombinant protein antigen and a protein preparation from arabidopsis . the purified anti antibodies recognized the recombinant protein and a band of similar molecular weight in a total protein preparation from arabidopsis which was not recognized by the pre immune serum . cross reacting bands were present in the crude serum blots that were mostly absent after affinity purification . it was observed that in addition to a prominent band of the expected molecular _METHOD_ a second weak band of slightly lower mobility on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was sometimes recognized by the antibodies . we hypothesized that this band may either correspond to a modified form of or because of the sequence similarity between and may correspond to . to investigate this further an arabidopsis knockout mutant was isolated from the gabi kat flanking sequence tag database in which the gene was disrupted by a t dna insertion . loss of gene _PROTEIN_ was confirmed by rt pcr using gene specific primers . no phenotype has yet been observed for the mutant either at a morphological level after examination throughout its lifecycle in protein trafficking pathways to the _LOCATION_ or in hormone related responses such as gravitropism . as the protein is closely related in sequence and and have overlapping _PROTEIN_ patterns we hypothesize that the two genes may perform redundant functions . comparison of protein extracts from the mutant with those from wild type plants by immunoblotting demonstrated that the major lower band of the doublet recognized by the antibodies was absent in the mutant confirming that it corresponds to itself . the higher much weaker band was still present in the mutant suggesting that this is most likely rather than a modified version of . the distribution of protein in aerial organs of arabidopsis mature plants was analyzed and compared with the rt pcr analysis of mrna level . high protein levels were seen in flowers inflorescence _METHOD_ and cauline leaves and lower but detectable levels in siliques and rosette leaves as well as a significant amount in roots and young seedlings . these results are consistent with the rt pcr analysis although much greater variation is seen in protein level than mrna level possibly suggesting that post translational regulation may occur . because snxs are typically associated with _LOCATION_ a total protein extract was separated into _LOCATION_ and soluble fractions by centrifugation at g and analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies . was detected in both the pellet and soluble fractions indicating that is partially _LOCATION_ associated . to analyze further this _LOCATION_ association differential centrifugation was performed at and g and fractions were probed for the presence of . was detected in all three _LOCATION_ fractions and the soluble fraction confirming that is partially _LOCATION_ associated . the upper weak band potentially also appeared to be _LOCATION_ associated although the weak and variable cross reactivity made it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about this protein . to determine how protein associates with the _LOCATION_ total _LOCATION_ pellets were re suspended in either extraction buffer alone or extraction buffer containing m nacl m na _PROTEIN_ m urea or triton x . after incubation for h _LOCATION_ were repelleted and pellet and supernatant fractions analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies . each of the treatments was able to extract from the _LOCATION_ indicating that is peripherally associated with _LOCATION_ . as a control _PROTEIN_ an integral _LOCATION_ protein was only extracted from the _LOCATION_ by the detergent triton x . snxs are defined by the presence of a px domain and its ability to bind phosphoinositol lipids . to determine if the px domain can associate with _PROTEIN_ lipids or phospholipids in general the px domain fragment of was fused with _PROTEIN_ to generate _PROTEIN_ px . as a control point mutations were introduced into the px domain to create an amino acid change that has been shown previously to prevent _PROTEIN_ binding in human snxs . _PROTEIN_ fusions with the wild type or mutant px domains were synthesized in e.coli purified over a glutathione resin and allowed to bind to _PROTEIN_ strips containing various phospholipids . binding was detected using antibodies against _PROTEIN_ . the px domain of _PROTEIN_ specifically bound to _PROTEIN_ while the px domain mutant _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ alone were not able to bind to any lipid . to gain insight into function its sub cellular localization was examined in vivo . a _METHOD_ fusion was generated with full length _METHOD_ and transiently _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts derived from suspension cultured cells . in addition _METHOD_ using anti antibodies was used to assess sub cellular localization in arabidopsis protoplasts . both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusion localization show that localizes to punctate spots in the cytoplasm . to verify that a full length _METHOD_ fusion is produced and correctly associates with _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and soluble fractions were prepared from protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ as a control . the proteins were _PROTEIN_ for h to allow the proteins to accumulate to high enough levels for detection by immunoblotting using _METHOD_ antibodies . a _METHOD_ fusion of the expected size was detected predominantly in the _LOCATION_ fraction . to analyze the role of the px domain in localization of to these structures a fusion between the full length protein containing the px domain mutation described above and _METHOD_ was generated _METHOD_ . in contrast to the wild type protein the _METHOD_ mutant did not localize to discrete structures but rather showed a diffuse _METHOD_ pattern throughout the cell suggesting that the px domain is required for correct localization in vivo . to determine whether the px domain alone is sufficient for localization to punctate spots _METHOD_ was fused with the px domain or mutant px domain alone and the localization analyzed by _METHOD_ microscopy . _METHOD_ px and _METHOD_ px fusions showed diffuse _METHOD_ patterns similar to the _METHOD_ mutant . to confirm this result an additional px domain mutant was generated . unfortunately the full length _METHOD_ fusion protein was not _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts based on _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the fusion of _METHOD_ with the px mutant px domain also showed diffuse cytoplasmic localization as for the wild type and px fusions . our results suggest that the px domain is necessary but not sufficient for the localization of to punctate compartments . as an initial approach to determine the identity of the labeled structures the distribution of and several known intracellular markers in a sucrose density gradient was examined . fractions from the gradient were analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies against aleurain _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fumarase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and . both the band and the cross reacting kda band were visible in these fractions . shows that has a bipartite distribution with a small part soluble and the majority _LOCATION_ bound as predicted from the differential centrifugation . the kda band was present in the same fractions as but showed a greater percentage present in the soluble fractions compared with _LOCATION_ bound . the distribution of the _LOCATION_ associated portion of on the sucrose gradient overlapped extensively with that of _PROTEIN_ and with the upper band of _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ antibodies recognize a triplet of proteins all of which correspond to the _PROTEIN_ protein the nature of these three _METHOD_ is unclear but may be due to post translational modifications . these results suggest a possible localization to an organelle with similar density to the tgn and/or pvc and distinct from the _LOCATION_ and mitochondria . to determine more precisely the localization of roots of transgenic arabidopsis lines _PROTEIN_ markers for the tgn _PROTEIN_ pvc _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ endosomes _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _LOCATION_ apparatus _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were analyzed by double _METHOD_ labeling using and antibodies or comparison with _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ _METHOD_ as appropriate . as in protoplasts antibodies recognized punctate structures in root cells that were not labeled with preimmune serum . to assess the specificity of labeling _METHOD_ was also performed under identical conditions on roots from the knockout mutant . no specific signal was seen indicating that the _METHOD_ staining observed corresponds only to . white spots in merged images show that some of the labeled organelles also contained _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . by contrast no overlap was seen between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and suggesting that does not reside in the _LOCATION_ apparatus . percent co localization was determined by counting the number of labeled structures that co localized with each of the markers . partial co localization of with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was observed . the pvc and _PROTEIN_ endosomal markers _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ show extensive overlap in their localization leading to the conclusion that a large portion of does not co localize with any of the markers tested . as our antibodies are specific for under these experimental conditions this localization pattern suggests that might localize to or cycle between pvc/late endosomal compartments the tgn which has been suggested also to be an early endosome and possibly an additional unidentified compartment . it is known that arabidopsis cells contain multiple endosome types and we therefore hypothesized that the unidentified compartment with which associates could be an additional type of endosome . to test this hypothesis we analyzed the localization of _METHOD_ in transiently transformed protoplasts compared with the _METHOD_ marker . is widely used as an endocytic tracer in live cells . the cell cultures used contain cells of varying sizes no differences were seen between large and small cells in any experiment . binds to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ is internalized by endocytosis traffics through the endosomal system and reaches the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ after h in arabidopsis . arabidopsis protoplasts were transiently transformed with _METHOD_ and incubated for h to allow _PROTEIN_ of the protein . they were then labeled with and uptake of the dye was observed over a time course of up to h . after h of uptake staining was seen _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ with a few puncta in the cytoplasm no co localization of with _METHOD_ was seen at this early time point . between and h of uptake was found in punctate structures that have been shown previously to correspond to _LOCATION_ pvc and endosomes . almost complete co localization of and _METHOD_ was seen at these times suggesting that is predominantly localized to organelles on the endocytic pathway . by the h time point reached the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in control protoplasts transformed with _METHOD_ alone while in _METHOD_ transformed protoplasts was not present on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ instead being trapped in cytoplasmic structures containing _METHOD_ . was not able to exit the _METHOD_ labeled compartments even after h. in addition the appearance of the _METHOD_ structures varied over time . at early time points the _METHOD_ localized to structures similar in appearance although apparently somewhat larger than the structures in which endogenous resides the size of these organelles is difficult to assess by _METHOD_ microscopy . at _PROTEIN_ time points these structures became enlarged and/or aggregated and by h of labeling the protoplasts contained just a few large _METHOD_ labeled structures . this is not related to the presence of as similar effects are seen in the absence of staining with a gradual increase in the size of the labeled structures over time . the _METHOD_ in the enlarged structures is most likely _LOCATION_ associated as it pellets with a _LOCATION_ fraction after lysis of protoplasts and it co localizes with which is a _LOCATION_ bound dye . these results suggest that overexpression of causes inhibition of trafficking to the _LOCATION_ possibly by blocking the exit of material from endosomes . to confirm that the inhibition of transport of to the _LOCATION_ was caused by an effect on trafficking rather than a loss of cell viability protoplasts were transiently transformed with the _METHOD_ construct and _PROTEIN_ allowed to proceed for up to h. _METHOD_ microscopy confirmed the formation of enlarged structures as above and protoplasts were stained with the vital stain fluorescein diacetate to assay for cell viability . no difference was seen between untransformed and transformed protoplasts and in both cases almost all protoplasts survived indicating very little loss of viability . to verify that overexpression of alone affects trafficking to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ rather than the presence of the _METHOD_ tag an untagged overexpression construct was introduced into protoplasts followed by labeling as above . similar to the effect of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ enlarged structures were observed in the cytoplasm and most of the failed to reach the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ even at _PROTEIN_ time points . this _METHOD_ that overexpression of affects trafficking along the endocytic pathway to the _LOCATION_ . biosynthetic protein trafficking to the plant _LOCATION_ occurs through at least two major pathways and markers are available for each pathway consisting of _METHOD_ fused to an n terminal _LOCATION_ sorting signal _METHOD_ or a c terminal _LOCATION_ sorting signal _METHOD_ . to determine whether the overexpression of inhibits either of these biosynthetic pathways in addition to endocytic trafficking was co _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts with either ntpp _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ ctpp . at h after transformation punctate motile _METHOD_ spots were seen along with a clear _LOCATION_ ntpp _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ ctpp signal . by h after transformation motile _METHOD_ spots diminished and _LOCATION_ labeling of _METHOD_ became very dominant . in protoplasts transformed with ntpp _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ ctpp alone only _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ signal was observed after h. in double transformants _PROTEIN_ ntpp _METHOD_ plus non motile _METHOD_ spots accumulated in addition to _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ labeling after h in contrast double transformed _METHOD_ ctpp protoplasts did not accumulate _METHOD_ spots and only _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ labeling was evident at the h time point . these results indicate that overexpression of causes accumulation of ntpp _METHOD_ in punctate structures in addition to the _LOCATION_ whereas no effect is seen on _METHOD_ ctpp trafficking . to determine whether the structures accumulating ntpp _METHOD_ upon overexpression of are the same structures in which accumulates protoplasts overexpressing and ntpp _METHOD_ were labeled with . at h after uptake labeling co localized with non _LOCATION_ ntpp _METHOD_ signal these co localized structures persisted up to h after uptake . this demonstrates that the ntpp _METHOD_ containing bodies that are the result of overexpression of are endosomes . while most of the ntpp _METHOD_ still reaches the _LOCATION_ upon overexpression these results suggest that overexpression of partially interferes with the normal trafficking of ntpp _METHOD_ . endogenous co localizes with tgn and endosomal markers . to determine whether these markers are also present in the enlarged structures produced upon overexpression protoplasts overexpressing _METHOD_ were probed with antibodies against the tgn marker _PROTEIN_ or the pvc marker _PROTEIN_ followed by _METHOD_ confocal microscopy . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were present in the enlarged _METHOD_ containing structures and the typical punctate organelles labeled by these antibodies in wild type cells are largely absent . this indicates that these enlarged structures are likely to be aberrant _LOCATION_ structures or aggregates containing markers proteins from multiple organelles .
