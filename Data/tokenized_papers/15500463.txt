in higher plants although several genes involved in shoot apical meristem formation and organ separation have been isolated the molecular _METHOD_ by which they function are largely unknown . cup _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are examples of two such genes that encode the nac domain proteins . this study investigated the molecular basis for their activities . _LOCATION_ localization assays indicated that green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ cuc proteins accumulate in the _LOCATION_ . yeast one hybrid and transient _PROTEIN_ assays demonstrated that the c terminal domain of the cuc has transactivation activity . domain swapping experiments revealed that the functional specificity of the cuc for promoting adventitious shoot formation resides in the highly conserved nac domain not in the ctd in which motifs specific to the cuc subfamily are located . taken together these observations suggest that cuc proteins transactivate the target genes involved in sam formation and organ separation through a specific interaction between the nac domain and the promoter region of the target genes .
