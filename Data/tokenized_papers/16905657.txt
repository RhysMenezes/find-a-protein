epsin and related proteins play important roles in various steps of protein trafficking in animal and yeast cells . many epsin homologs have been identified in plant cells from analysis of genome sequences . however their roles have not been elucidated . here we investigate the _PROTEIN_ localization and biological role in protein trafficking of an epsin homolog arabidopsis thaliana which is _PROTEIN_ in most tissues we examined . in the cell one pool of is associated with actin filaments producing a network pattern and a second pool localizes primarily to the _LOCATION_ complex with a minor portion to the prevacuolar compartment producing a punctate staining pattern . protein pull down and coimmunoprecipitation experiments reveal that arabidopsis interacts with clathrin _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ related protein and _LOCATION_ sorting _PROTEIN_ . in addition colocalizes with clathrin and _PROTEIN_ . the mutant which has a t dna insertion in displays a defect in the _LOCATION_ trafficking of sporamin green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ but not in the secretion of invertase _METHOD_ into the medium . stably _PROTEIN_ ha complements this trafficking defect . based on these data we propose that plays an important role in the _LOCATION_ trafficking of soluble proteins at the trans _LOCATION_ network via its interaction with adr _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and clathrin .
the arabidopsis genome encodes three highly similar epsin related proteins and . in this study we investigated the biological role of . has the highly conserved enth domain at the n terminus . however the rest of the molecule is less similar to other epsin related proteins although it has motifs such as lidl and dpf that may function as clathrin and ap binding motifs respectively . to understand the biological role of its _PROTEIN_ in various plant tissues was examined . an antibody was raised against the middle domain of . the antibody recognized a protein band at kd which was much larger than the expected size kd of . it was shown previously that epsin related proteins migrate slower than expected in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the control serum did not recognize any protein bands . this result suggested that the antibody specifically recognized . to confirm this protoplasts were transformed with tagged with ha at the n terminus and protein extracts from the transformed protoplasts were analyzed by protein gel blotting using anti ha and anti antibodies . the anti ha antibody specifically recognized a protein band from the transformed protoplasts but not from the untransformed protoplasts at kd . in addition the kd protein species was recognized by the anti antibody confirming that the kd band was . the _PROTEIN_ of in various tissues was examined using the anti antibody . protein extracts were prepared from various tissues at different stages of plant growth and used for protein gel blot analysis . was _PROTEIN_ in all of the tissues examined with the highest _PROTEIN_ in cotyledons and flowers . to examine the subcellular distribution of total protein extracts from leaf tissues were separated into soluble and _LOCATION_ fractions and analyzed by protein gel blotting using anti antibody . was detected in both _LOCATION_ and soluble fractions . as controls for the fractionation arabidopsis aleurain like protease _PROTEIN_ and arabidopsis _LOCATION_ sorting receptor were detected with anti _PROTEIN_ and anti vsr antibodies respectively . _PROTEIN_ is a soluble protein present in the _LOCATION_ lumen and vsr is a _LOCATION_ protein that is localized primarily to the pvc with a minor portion to the _LOCATION_ complex . as expected _PROTEIN_ and vsr were detected in the supernatant and pellet fractions respectively . these results indicated that localized to multiple locations consistent with the behavior of other epsin related proteins . next we defined the subcellular localization of . our initial attempts to localize the endogenous with the anti antibody failed . thus we determined the localization of protein transiently _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts . was tagged with the ha epitope green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ or red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . the amount of total protein was determined using various amounts of ha plasmid dna by protein gel blot analysis with anti antibody and was found to be proportional to the amount of plasmid used . for the localization we used a minimal amount of plasmid dnas . protoplasts were transformed with ha and localization of was determined by immunostaining with anti ha antibody . ha produced primarily a punctate staining pattern . in addition to punctate stains we occasionally observed weakly stained strings that connected punctate stains . by contrast the nontransformed controls did not produce any patterns . in protoplasts transformed with _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ both fusion proteins produced a network pattern with punctate stains whereas _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ alone produced diffuse patterns indicating that produces the network pattern with punctate stains . these results were further confirmed by cotransforming the protoplasts with either _METHOD_ and ha or _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . the punctate staining pattern of _METHOD_ closely overlapped that of ha . in addition the network and punctate staining patterns of _METHOD_ closely overlapped those of _METHOD_ . however the fine networks revealed by _METHOD_ in the live protoplasts were nearly absent in the fixed protoplasts . thus the differences in the staining patterns between fixed and live protoplasts may be attributable to the _PROTEIN_ that the network pattern of live protoplasts are not well preserved under the fixing conditions used . in addition the strings occasionally observed in the fixed protoplasts may represent the remnants of the network pattern revealed by ha . these results strongly suggest that is responsible for the network pattern as well as the punctate stains . the network pattern was reminiscent of the _LOCATION_ or actin pattern in plant cells whereas the punctate staining pattern suggested that may localize to the _LOCATION_ complex or endosomes as observed previously with epsin homologs in animal and yeast cells . therefore protoplasts were cotransformed with _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ talin a marker for actin filaments consisting of _METHOD_ and the actin binding domain of mouse talin . as expected _METHOD_ talin produced the network pattern . furthermore the red _METHOD_ network pattern of _METHOD_ closely overlapped the green _METHOD_ network pattern of _METHOD_ talin raising the possibility that _METHOD_ bound to the actin filaments rather than to the _LOCATION_ . to confirm this the _METHOD_ pattern was examined after treatment with latrunculin b a chemical agent known to disrupt actin filaments . lat b treated protoplasts produced the diffuse green _METHOD_ pattern of _METHOD_ talin an indication of solubilized actin filaments as observed previously . in addition the lat b treated protoplasts displayed a diffuse red _METHOD_ pattern of _METHOD_ indicating that is associated with actin filaments but not with the _LOCATION_ . furthermore the punctate staining pattern of _METHOD_ also was not observed in the presence of lat b indicating that actin filaments played a role in yielding the punctate staining pattern of . in the same conditions bip _METHOD_ an _LOCATION_ marker produced a network pattern indicating that lat b does not disrupt the _LOCATION_ network patterns . to identify the organelle responsible for the punctate staining pattern of its localization was compared with that of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a chimeric protein between rat sialyltransferase and _METHOD_ localizes to the _LOCATION_ complex and _PROTEIN_ a t snare localizes to the pvc . protoplasts were cotransformed with ha and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the localization of these proteins was examined after staining with anti ha antibody . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was observed directly with the green _METHOD_ signals . a major portion of the ha positive punctate stains closely overlapped with those of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . to further confirm the _LOCATION_ localization of ha protoplasts transformed with ha were treated with brefeldin a a chemical known to disrupt the _LOCATION_ complex and the localization of ha was examined . in the presence of bfa ha yielded a largely diffuse pattern with aggregates but not the punctate staining pattern indicating that bfa affects localization . in the same conditions _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ produced a network pattern with large aggregates confirming that the _LOCATION_ complex was disrupted . these results support the notion that localizes to the _LOCATION_ complex . next we examined the possibility of localizing to the pvc . protoplasts were cotransformed with _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ ha . the localization of _PROTEIN_ ha was examined after staining with anti ha antibody . _METHOD_ was observed directly with the green _METHOD_ signals . only a minor portion of the _METHOD_ positive punctate stains overlapped with the _PROTEIN_ ha positive punctate stains . these results indicated that localized primarily to the _LOCATION_ complex with a minor portion to the pvc . to obtain independent evidence for the localization we examined the colocalization of with _PROTEIN_ a v snare that is distributed equally to both the tgn and the pvc . protoplasts were cotransformed with _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ ha and the localization of these proteins was examined by immunostaining with anti ha antibody . positive punctate stains largely colocalized with those of _PROTEIN_ ha confirming that localizes to both the _LOCATION_ complex and the pvc . the members of the epsin family have two clathrin binding motifs . sequence analysis indicated that has a potential clathrin binding motif . to explore the possibility that binds to clathrin glutathione s transferase fused _PROTEIN_ was constructed for a protein pull down assay . _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli and purified from e. coli extracts . the purified _PROTEIN_ was mixed with protein extracts obtained from leaf tissues . proteins pelleted with glutathione agarose were analyzed by protein gel blotting using anti clathrin antibody . _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ alone precipitated from the plant extracts a kd protein species that was recognized by anti clathrin antibody indicating that bound to clathrin . to further examine its binding to clathrin was divided into two regions the enth and the remainder of the molecule . these regions were _PROTEIN_ in e. coli as _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins _PROTEIN_ enth and _PROTEIN_ respectively . protein pull down experiments using leaf cell extracts were performed with purified _PROTEIN_ enth and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ enth precipitated clathrin from the plant extracts . to identify the clathrin binding motif the c terminal region containing the putative clathrin binding motif lidl as well as _PROTEIN_ ridl which contained an arg substitution of the first leu residue in the motif were _PROTEIN_ as _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins in e. coli . _PROTEIN_ lidl but not _PROTEIN_ ridl precipitated clathrin from protein extracts indicating that the lidl motif functioned as a clathrin binding motif . the in vitro binding of with clathrin strongly suggested that was likely to colocalize with clathrin . therefore immunohistochemistry for the localization of and clathrin was performed . protoplasts were transformed with ha and the localization of ha and clathrin was examined by staining with anti ha and anti clathrin antibodies respectively . the anti clathrin antibody produced a punctate staining pattern . a majority of the ha positive punctate stains closely overlapped with a pool of clathrin positive punctate stains consistent with an interaction between and clathrin . there was also a pool of clathrin positive punctate stains that lacked the ha signal suggesting that clathrin also was involved in an independent process . to further characterize the interaction between and clathrin we examined whether or not is permanently associated with ccvs . protein extracts from leaf tissues were first separated into soluble and pellet fractions by ultracentrifugation . the pellet fraction was treated with triton x and further fractionated by gel filtration and the fractions were analyzed by protein gel blotting using anti clathrin anti epsin and anti vsr antibodies . clathrin was detected in a peak between and kd . interestingly vsr the _LOCATION_ cargo receptor was eluted at the same position with clathrin . by contrast was eluted at kd . these results suggest that is not permanently associated with ccvs . epsin related proteins in animal and yeast cells are involved in either endocytosis or _LOCATION_ protein trafficking . to elucidate the pathway of involvement binding partners of were examined . in animal and yeast cells epsin like proteins have been shown to interact with snares . because localized to the _LOCATION_ complex and the pvc interactions with arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were examined . _PROTEIN_ is a v snare that localizes to the tgn and travels to the pvc . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were tagged with ha at the c terminus and introduced into protoplasts . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ ha and _PROTEIN_ ha in protoplasts was confirmed by protein gel blot analysis using anti ha antibody . the anti ha antibody detected protein bands at and kd the expected positions of _PROTEIN_ ha and _PROTEIN_ ha respectively . purified _PROTEIN_ from e. coli extracts was mixed with plant extracts from the _PROTEIN_ ha or _PROTEIN_ ha transformed protoplasts and _PROTEIN_ bound proteins were precipitated from the mixture using glutathione agarose beads . the pellet fraction was analyzed by protein gel blotting using anti ha antibody . _PROTEIN_ ha but not _PROTEIN_ ha was detected from the pellet . _PROTEIN_ alone did not precipitate _PROTEIN_ ha from the plant extracts . these results indicated that although _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are highly similar to each other specifically binds to _PROTEIN_ ha . to further confirm this interaction we performed a reciprocal protein pull down experiment _PROTEIN_ using protein extracts obtained from protoplasts transformed with _PROTEIN_ ha and _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ ha bound proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti ha antibody and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by protein gel blotting using anti ha anti _METHOD_ and anti calreticulin antibodies . anti calreticulin antibody was used as a negative control . in addition to _PROTEIN_ ha _METHOD_ was detected in the immunoprecipitates . however calreticulin was not detected in the pellet . these results further confirm the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and . to determine the _PROTEIN_ binding domain of protein pull down experiments were performed using _PROTEIN_ enth and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ enth but not _PROTEIN_ precipitated _PROTEIN_ ha from the plant extracts indicating that the enth domain contained the _PROTEIN_ binding motif . similarly in animal and yeast cells epsinr and _PROTEIN_ have been shown to bind to _PROTEIN_ and respectively . epsin homologs bind to _PROTEIN_ proteins . in animal cells binds to the _PROTEIN_ of ap via the and fxdxf motifs . arabidopsis has three dpf motifs to which _PROTEIN_ of ap could bind . in addition has two regions with motifs similar to the acidic phe motif for binding ap and ggas . therefore the interactions of with ap complexes were examined . we isolated the arabidopsis proteins _PROTEIN_ related protein adr and adr which were most closely related to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ of ap ap and ap respectively . these arabidopsis proteins were tagged with _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ transiently in protoplasts . protein extracts from the transformed protoplasts were mixed with purified _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ bound proteins were precipitated . the pellet was analyzed by protein gel blotting using anti _METHOD_ antibody . _METHOD_ adr but not adr _METHOD_ or adr _METHOD_ was detected in the pellet . the control for the protein pull down assay _PROTEIN_ alone did not precipitate any of these proteins . these results strongly suggested that interacts with adr specifically . to further confirm the interaction between and adr we performed a reciprocal protein pull down experiment . the ear domain of adr was _PROTEIN_ as a maltose binding protein fusion protein mbp adr in e. coli . purified mbp adr was mixed with protein extracts obtained from protoplasts transformed with full length ha or its deletion mutants and mbp adr bound proteins were precipitated with amylose resin . the precipitates were analyzed by protein gel blotting using anti ha antibody . full length ha and ha but not ha enth were detected in the pellets further confirming the interaction between adr and . furthermore these results indicated that the c terminal region of was responsible for the interaction with adr . to confirm the interaction between and adr and that binds to adr directly the binding of was examined with mbp fused ear domains of adr or adr _PROTEIN_ in e. coli respectively . _PROTEIN_ was incubated with mbp adr mbp adr or mbp alone . _PROTEIN_ bound proteins were precipitated from the reaction mixture and analyzed by protein gel blotting using anti mbp antibody . mbp adr bound strongly to _PROTEIN_ . interestingly mbp adr also bound weakly to _PROTEIN_ possibly because of the three dpf motifs in the middle domain of . dpf or dpw motifs are known to bind to the ear domain of ap . however the binding affinity of for the adr ear domain was > fold higher than that for the adr ear domain . these results strongly suggest that adr and adr are arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ of ap and _PROTEIN_ of ap respectively and that binds primarily to adr . it is not clear whether the adr binding of has a physiological role in vivo . to further characterize the binding partners of binding to arabidopsis _LOCATION_ sorting receptor that localizes primarily to the pvc but travels to the tgn for cargo examined . _PROTEIN_ tagged with ha at the c terminus was _PROTEIN_ transiently in protoplasts . we showed previously that transiently _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ha localized primarily to the pvc with a minor portion to the _LOCATION_ complex . protein extracts were prepared from the transformed protoplasts and incubated with _PROTEIN_ . as negative and positive controls protein extracts were prepared from protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ha and _PROTEIN_ ha respectively . bound proteins were precipitated from the reaction mixture and analyzed by protein gel blotting using anti ha antibody . _PROTEIN_ ha but not _PROTEIN_ ha was detected in the pellet indicating that bound specifically to _PROTEIN_ . to further confirm the interaction we performed a protein pull down experiment of _METHOD_ with _PROTEIN_ ha from the extracts of protoplasts cotransformed with _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ ha . _PROTEIN_ ha was immunoprecipitated with anti ha antibody and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by protein gel blotting using anti ha anti _METHOD_ and anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies . anti _PROTEIN_ antibody was used as a negative control . in addition to _PROTEIN_ ha _METHOD_ was detected in the immunoprecipitates . however _PROTEIN_ was not detected in the pellet . these results further confirm the interaction between and _PROTEIN_ . to define the _PROTEIN_ binding region of _PROTEIN_ enth and _PROTEIN_ were used in protein pull down experiments . _PROTEIN_ enth but not _PROTEIN_ brought down _PROTEIN_ ha from the reaction mixture indicating that the enth domain contained the _PROTEIN_ binding domain . the protein protein interaction data of strongly suggested that was involved in trafficking soluble proteins to the lytic _LOCATION_ . to examine the role of the t dna insertion mutant from the salk t dna insertion mutant library was used . pcr was used to confirm that this mutant had a t dna insertion in the promoter region of . homozygote mutant plants were screened by pcr because the mutant did not display any morphological alterations . because the mutant had a t dna insertion in the promoter region of protein gel blot analysis with anti antibody was used to determine the level . in the homozygote plants the level was reduced to to of the wild type level . the mutant plants were examined for defects in protein trafficking . previously we showed that sporamin _METHOD_ _METHOD_ a chimeric protein consisting of _METHOD_ and the n terminal region of sporamin was targeted to the central _LOCATION_ in protoplasts . it had been shown previously that when spo _METHOD_ was transported to the central _LOCATION_ in protoplasts it was processed from a kd precursor to a kd form . therefore the amount of the processed form could be used to measure trafficking efficiency . protoplasts obtained from the mutant were transformed with spo _METHOD_ and trafficking of the reporter protein to the central _LOCATION_ was examined by protein gel blot analysis using anti _METHOD_ antibody . protein extracts were obtained from protoplasts at various time points after transformation . with wild type protoplasts at and h after transformation and of the spo _METHOD_ respectively was in the processed form . however in protoplasts from mutants the amount of kd processed protein was reduced significantly at and h after transformation the amount of the processed form was and respectively . these results clearly indicated that was involved in the _LOCATION_ trafficking of spo _METHOD_ . to confirm that the inhibition of _LOCATION_ trafficking was attributable to the mutation transgenic plants were generated with ha on the background . the _PROTEIN_ of ha in transgenic plants was examined by protein gel blot analysis using protein extracts obtained from three independent lines of the generation . the anti ha antibody detected a specific band from all three independent lines . furthermore the levels of proteins were significantly increased in the transgenic plants compared with plants . next protoplasts were obtained from the leaf tissues of wild type plants and plants and transformed with spo _METHOD_ . the trafficking efficiency was recovered to the wild type level in the plants confirming that the defect in the _LOCATION_ trafficking in mutant plants is attributable to the mutation in . to examine the specificity of in _LOCATION_ trafficking the secretion into the medium of invertase _METHOD_ a chimeric protein consisting of secretory invertase and _METHOD_ was examined . protoplasts obtained from and wild type plants were transformed with invertase _METHOD_ . protein extracts were prepared from the transformed protoplasts and from the incubation medium and analyzed by protein gel blotting using anti _METHOD_ antibody . as expected wild type protoplasts efficiently secreted invertase _METHOD_ into the medium . nor was the secretion of invertase _METHOD_ affected in protoplasts from the mutants indicating that is not involved in the secretion of the protein .
