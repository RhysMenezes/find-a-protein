the lipophilic biopolyester suberin _METHOD_ important boundaries to protect the plant from its surrounding environment or to separate different tissues within the plant . in roots suberin can be found in the cell walls of the endodermis and the hypodermis or periderm . apoplastic barriers composed of suberin accomplish the _PROTEIN_ to restrict water and nutrient loss and prevent the invasion of pathogens . despite the physiological importance of suberin and the knowledge of the suberin composition of many plants very little is known about its biosynthesis and the genes involved . here a detailed analysis of the arabidopsis aliphatic suberin in roots at different developmental stages is presented . this study demonstrates some variability in suberin amount and composition along the root axis and indicates the importance of hydroxylation for suberin biosynthesis . using reverse genetics the cytochrome fatty acid hydroxylase _PROTEIN_ has been identified as a key enzyme for aliphatic root suberin biosynthesis in arabidopsis . the corresponding _PROTEIN_ mutants show a substantial reduction in hydroxyacids with a chain length < _PROTEIN_ demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ functions as a hydroxylase of root suberized tissue . detailed _PROTEIN_ studies revealed a strong root specificity and a localized _PROTEIN_ in the root endodermis . transgenic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ distributed _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ indicating that suberin monomer biosynthesis takes place in this sub cellular compartment before intermediates are exported in the apoplast .
to gain more insights into the biochemical reactions involved in the formation of aliphatic root suberin suberin compositional changes in the course of root development were studied in more detail . roots of week old fully developed arabidopsis plants were dissected in three zones along the root axis for histochemical and chemical analysis . the basal zone ranged from the root base mm towards the tip . the middle zone contained the tissue of the next consecutive mm and the apical root zone is represented by the remaining distal tissue including the root tip . representative cross sections were microscopically examined and histochemically analysed using sudan a lipophilic dye commonly used to stain suberin depositions . the basal root zone is _PROTEIN_ represented by roots in a secondary developmental stage characterized by suberin depositions in the cell walls of the outermost peridermal cell layer . similar suberized _METHOD_ were observed in cross sections from the middle root zone . the apical root zone was dominated by roots in a primary developmental stage characterized by the presence of an endodermis with apoplastic suberin depositions . tissue distribution and suberin composition in different developmental stages of the arabidopsis root . arabidopsis root sectioned in the three zones investigated . the positions of the cross sections from b c and d are indicated by dashed lines . bright field microscopic picture of representative cross sections of the arabidopsis root stained with the lipophilic dye sudan . the red stained suberin is deposited in the periderm of the roots in a secondary developmental stage or in the endodermal cell walls of the roots in a primary developmental stage . aliphatic suberin composition and amount in the different developmental stages of the arabidopsis root . suberin monomer composition in dry weight in the basal middle and apical root zone . substance class distribution in the three root zones in relative amounts . total aliphatic suberin amount in dry weight in the three root zones . values alc. alcohols oh ac. hydroxyacids diac. diacids ac. hydroxyacid are given as mean of three replicates each containing mg isolated suberized root cell wall material . p periderm e endodermis c cortex . to analyse the quantity and composition of the aliphatic root suberin root tissue of the different root zones was subjected to depolymerization and subsequently analysed using gc and gc _METHOD_ . the same monomers were detected in the suberin hydrolysate of all three root zones unsubstituted fatty acids ranging in chain length from to _PROTEIN_ primary alcohols _PROTEIN_ hydroxyacids _PROTEIN_ diacids _PROTEIN_ and hydroxyacids _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the most prominent substance classes in all root zones are hydroxyacids and diacids . along the root axis all aliphatic suberin monomers increase from the tip to the base . the total aliphatic suberin amount in the basal root part is more than twice the amount in the apical part . in the substance class composition the relative amounts of diacids and alcohols did not change . however significant changes in the relative amounts of hydroxyacids and fatty acids were detected among the different root zones . comparing the apical and the basal root zones the relative amount of hydroxyacids increased > in the basal zone . by contrast the relative amount of fatty acids is significantly reduced in this zone compared with in the apical zone . a reduction from the tip to the base was also observed in the minor compounds of the hydroxyacid class . the abundance of hydroxyacids and diacids in aliphatic root suberin in arabidopsis and the significant increase in hydroxyacids as suberin formation goes on during root development indicates that hydroxylases are required for suberin monomer biosynthesis . of the known fatty acid hydroxylases _PROTEIN_ is preferentially _PROTEIN_ in roots . therefore _PROTEIN_ seemed to be a good candidate for an involvement in suberin biosynthesis . to investigate the in vivo function of _PROTEIN_ a reverse genetics approach was chosen . two allelic t dna insertion mutant lines in _PROTEIN_ were obtained from the nottingham arabidopsis stock centre and further characterized . since it was supposed that _PROTEIN_ encodes a hydroxylase in suberin formation the mutant lines were named _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for hydroxylase of root suberized tissue . pcr amplification of t dna flanking genomic sequences showed that _PROTEIN_ carries the t dna insertion in the first exon of _PROTEIN_ whereas in _PROTEIN_ the t dna insertion is located in the second exon . the progeny of the salk insertion lines were genotyped using pcr and homozygous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants were used to determine the _PROTEIN_ transcript levels by semi quantitative rt pcr . in contrast to wild type no _PROTEIN_ transcript could be detected in total rna from _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings . no obvious phenotypes could be observed when _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant lines were grown together and compared with wild type plants . _PROTEIN_ locus and mutant verification . structure of the _PROTEIN_ gene and designated locations of the _PROTEIN_ alleles . rt pcr analysis of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in d old seedlings of wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complemented plants . to investigate a potential involvement of _PROTEIN_ in suberin biosynthesis a qualitative and quantitative root suberin analysis of _PROTEIN_ mutants was performed by gc and gc _METHOD_ and compared with the corresponding wild type . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ aliphatic suberin exhibited significant reductions in the amount of specific monomers of all compound classes except alcohols . the most pronounced reductions were detected in hydroxyacids of chain length and and diacids with chain length _PROTEIN_ . however significant reductions could also be detected in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fatty acids and significant but less pronounced reductions can be detected in hydroxyacids of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ suberin . in total _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ aliphatic root suberin amount is reduced by and respectively compared with the wild type . aliphatic suberin composition in wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . suberin monomer composition . total amount of each substance class and total aliphatic suberin amount . suberin analysis of week old plants in dry weight of four or five replicates each containing one or two roots . statistically significant changes are indicated at . to verify that the suberin phenotypes determined in _PROTEIN_ mutant lines are attributed to the knockout of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants were transformed with a wild type genomic fragment comprising the kb region upstream of the predicted _PROTEIN_ start codon and the _PROTEIN_ encoding genomic sequence . rt pcr analysis on total rna from hygromycin resistant seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ confirmed the successful reintegration and _PROTEIN_ of wild type _PROTEIN_ . wild type levels of _PROTEIN_ intron excised transcript were detected in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants . root suberin analysis of the complemented _PROTEIN_ transformed _PROTEIN_ plants revealed a quantitative and qualitative aliphatic suberin composition similar to the wild type . since hydroxyacids and diacids the most strongly affected compounds in the _PROTEIN_ mutant suberin are also abundant monomers in the biopolyesters of leaves and seeds these tissues were also analysed for compositional changes in their long chain aliphatic compounds . no significant differences could be detected in the leaf and seed polyester composition of the wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . other significantly reduced monomers in _PROTEIN_ suberin are unsubstituted fatty acids . however the amount of long chain fatty acids as part of leaf waxes and other fatty acid derived wax monomers is not modified in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . cutin seed coat and wax analysis in wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . leaf cutin substance class composition and total amount in of three replicates each containing leaves . seed coat substance class composition and total amount in dry weight of five replicates each containing at least seeds . leaf wax substance class composition and total amount in of five replicates each containing seven leaves . to investigate the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ in more detail on the organ and tissue level experiments using rt pcr and gus reporter gene constructs were performed . rt pcr analysis on total rna preparations from different organs resulted in no detectable _PROTEIN_ transcript levels in above ground organs such as leaves _METHOD_ flowers and siliques . in roots high _PROTEIN_ levels for _PROTEIN_ were detected in all three root zones from the tip to the base . organ specific _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ determined by rt pcr of _PROTEIN_ transcript levels in three different root zones leaves _METHOD_ flowers and siliques of week old fully developed arabidopsis plants . in each reaction of total rna was used . actin was used as a control . for _PROTEIN_ analysis of _PROTEIN_ on the tissue level the kb putative promoter region upstream of the predicted _PROTEIN_ start codon was fused in frame to the _PROTEIN_ gene and used to transform wild type arabidopsis . several independent gus transgenic plant lines were investigated . gus staining was observed in the root of all gus seedlings while gus activity was not found in the hypocotyl or cotyledons . microscopic examination of the intact seedling roots showed gus staining in the centre of the root inside cortical tissue . in cross sections of gus stained gus roots gus protein activity could be located to the endodermis . similar to seedlings no gus staining could be observed under these conditions in above ground organs like leaves or _METHOD_ of mature plants . tissue _PROTEIN_ pattern and sub cellular protein localization . gus staining in arabidopsis transformed with a gus construct in a d old seedling gus staining is only observed in the root close up view of the intact seedling root with a gus staining limited to the centre of the root cross section through the seedling root showing gus staining restricted to the endodermis . confocal microscope pictures of

structures over the time indicated by an arrow co localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and hdel dsred in _LOCATION_ network shown in the merged image . cc central cylinder e endodermis c cortex . in order to examine the sub cellular protein localization of _PROTEIN_ the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ was fused to the end of the coding sequence of _PROTEIN_ . employment of the native promoter to drive the _PROTEIN_ of this construct in transgenic arabidopsis plants resulted in a weak _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in roots only slightly above background . the weak _METHOD_ signal did not allow the _METHOD_ localization inside the root tissue with a resolution high enough for sub cellular localization in endodermal tissue . therefore we focused on heterologous _PROTEIN_ and transiently _PROTEIN_ this construct _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the control of the promoter in the epidermis of nicotiana benthamiana leaves . using confocal laser scanning microscopy intense _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in reticulate structures characteristic for _LOCATION_ . continuous observation of the _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ revealed the movement of these membranous structures typical of _LOCATION_ in vital cells . co _PROTEIN_ with an _LOCATION_ marker construct containing the hdel retention signal for _LOCATION_ fused to dsred revealed it co localized with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ .
