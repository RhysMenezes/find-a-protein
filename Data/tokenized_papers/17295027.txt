a group of _LOCATION_ transcription _PROTEIN_ the whirly proteins were recently shown to be targeted also to chloroplasts and mitochondria . in order to find out whether other proteins might share this feature an in silico based screening of transcription _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis and rice was carried out with the aim of identifying putative n terminal chloroplast and mitochondrial targeting sequences . for this the individual predictions of several independent _METHOD_ were combined to a consensus prediction using a bayes method . this consensus prediction shows a higher specificity at a given sensitivity value than each of the single _METHOD_ . in both species transcription _PROTEIN_ from a variety of protein families that possess putative n terminal _LOCATION_ or mitochondrial target peptides as well as _LOCATION_ localization sequences were found . a search for homologues within members of the _PROTEIN_ protein family revealed that target peptide containing proteins are conserved among monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous species . fusion of one of these proteins to _METHOD_ revealed indeed a dual targeting activity of this protein . we propose that dually targeted transcription _PROTEIN_ might be involved in the communication between the _LOCATION_ and the organelles in plant cells . we further discuss how recent results on the physical interaction between the organelles and the _LOCATION_ could have significance for the regulation of the localization of these proteins .
for most of the annotated plant transcription _PROTEIN_ no experimental data concerning their subcellular localization are available . analyses of these proteins are complicated by the _PROTEIN_ that they are often present in trace amounts only . sensitive methods like _METHOD_ spectrometric analysis of compartmental proteomes are prone to artifacts because of the danger of cross contamination from other cell compartments . optical in vivo techniques based on the fusion with _METHOD_ proteins such as _METHOD_ or immunological methods are more reliable but are only available for a few selected proteins . for the task of identifying potential candidates that are targeted to one of the organelles a prediction method of the subcellular localization that picks up as many true positives for a given compartment while keeping the number of false positives or true negatives as low as possible is highly desired . wagner and pfannschmidt have recently listed putatively _LOCATION_ targeted transcription _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis based on the prediction with the program targetp . in contrast we have chosen an approach where the results of several prediction _METHOD_ were combined to a consensus prediction using a bayes method . in order to compare the performance of the consensus prediction to those of the individual single prediction _METHOD_ that contribute to it the specificities were calculated using sets of organellar test proteins consisting of > proteins from arabidopsis and other species . for control a test set of > proteins of confirmed non organellar localization was used . we found that for both _LOCATION_ and mitochondrial proteins the consensus prediction method showed a higher specificity at a reference sensitivity of than the single predictions which contribute to the consensus . the vast majority of the organellar test set proteins achieved consensus score values of and above . when used on the experimental sets of dna binding _PROTEIN_ domain proteins and transcription _PROTEIN_ we found again that those proteins with a confirmed localization _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ had values of above . our algorithm predicted high scores of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for these proteins respectively . two more _PROTEIN_ domain proteins also received high scores for _LOCATION_ and mitochondria whereas the remaining _PROTEIN_ domain proteins were not indicated as being organelle targeted by the prediction method . this is consistent with their confirmed or presumed location according to the _PROTEIN_ proteomic database . based on these results we decided to use as cutoff value . below this value the risk of contamination by false positives was observed to increase . the arabidopsis transcription _PROTEIN_ database currently lists different proteins from transcription _PROTEIN_ families . a similar list containing currently different loci grouped in transcription _PROTEIN_ families was compiled for rice by the rice transcription _PROTEIN_ database . the protein sequences from these lists were subjected to a search for targeting sequences to _LOCATION_ and mitochondria . among the arabidopsis transcription _PROTEIN_ we identified proteins that possess putative _LOCATION_ targeting sequences and proteins with a putative mitochondrial presequence . fifty one of the proteins with a ctp possess an additional sequence that can target the protein to the _LOCATION_ while proteins lack such a sequence . of the putative mitochondrial proteins possess no additional targeting sequences while contain a nls . most of the proteins without known _LOCATION_ localization sequences have a molecular weight below kda and might thus not necessarily need a nls for _LOCATION_ import . in rice proteins with a ctp and proteins with a mitochondrial presequence possess a nls . furthermore proteins exclusively possess a ctp while proteins have only a mitochondrial presequence . in tables and these proteins are listed according to their affiliation with the different transcription _PROTEIN_ families . of the arabidopsis transcription _PROTEIN_ families and the transcription _PROTEIN_ families of rice and respectively possess members with putative organellar presequences . these include large families with numerous members such as the _PROTEIN_ and zinc finger domain protein families or the _PROTEIN_ proteins . on the other hand also small protein families like the gebp or whirly transcription _PROTEIN_ families are included . apart from the three whirly proteins of arabidopsis only three proteins from the list of identified proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were so far analyzed for their subcellular localization using _METHOD_ based techniques . all three were reported to be in the _LOCATION_ . however in the case of the _METHOD_ _GENE_ fusion the confocal images showed more than one _METHOD_ spot per cell . these spots were not seen with a _LOCATION_ control construct and can thus not be assigned to a specific compartment . a dual localization of this protein was therefore not refuted . three transcription _PROTEIN_ were identified by different _METHOD_ spectrometric approaches but no confirmation of these by other methods exists . only one was identified as a _LOCATION_ protein whereas the other two were detected in a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fraction . the _PROTEIN_ protein family is among the families with the most putative _LOCATION_ or mitochondrial targeting sequences . this protein family is defined by the _PROTEIN_ domain which consists of amino acids and is involved in dna binding . based on the number of _PROTEIN_ domains and other conserved motifs the _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ family is divided into four subfamilies the _LOCATION_ subfamily the _PROTEIN_ subfamily the rav subfamily and the dreb subfamily . _LOCATION_ and dreb subfamilies are both characterized by the possession of a single _PROTEIN_ domain and are thus often _PROTEIN_ as one protein family . to analyze the phylogenetic position of the putative organellar proteins among the _PROTEIN_ proteins we constructed a phylogenetic tree with all _PROTEIN_ domain containing proteins of arabidopsis . of the twelve putative _LOCATION_ proteins nine were identified as members of the dreb subfamily . dreb proteins are reportedly involved in drought and low temperature stress responses in plant cells . two of the other putative _LOCATION_ proteins are members of the _PROTEIN_ subfamily and a third one belongs to the rav subfamily whereas both putative mitochondrial proteins belong to the _LOCATION_ subfamily . for phylogenetic comparison of the individual putative organellar _PROTEIN_ proteins from arabidopsis and rice a phylogenetic tree was constructed using only the sequences of the putative organellar proteins from both species . the proteins were designated using the nomenclature defined by nakano et al . where dreb proteins are represented by _LOCATION_ groups i to iv and _LOCATION_ proteins in senso stricto are represented by groups v to x . the phylogenetic tree showed that most arabidopsis genes contain one or more closely related orthologues in rice the only exceptions being the four arabidopsis proteins belonging to group ii of the _LOCATION_ proteins . no arabidopsis orthologues could be found for any of the rice proteins belonging to groups xi to xiv which is consistent with previous observations . the existence of homologous pairs or groups of putative organellar proteins in arabidopsis and rice prompted us to search for related proteins in other species . for the _PROTEIN_ protein from arabidopsis that gained the highest chloroplast score and that is encoded by the gene locus _GENE_ several homologous proteins from both dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous species could be identified . these include a protein from maize one from triticum monococcum one from barley a protein from medicago trunculata and one from potato that was deduced from the fused amino acid sequences of two overlapping est sequences _PROTEIN_ . a similar number of homologues were found for the gene product of _GENE_ that is putatively targeted to mitochondria . table shows that all proteins from these species are strongly predicted to be targeted to either the _LOCATION_ or the mitochondria . an alignment of six sequences homologous to the _GENE_ gene product revealed a high sequence identity within the _PROTEIN_ domain and beyond that the existence of further domains that are highly conserved . _PROTEIN_ domains are characterized by several well conserved amino acids that constitute a putative amphipathic helix and are generally divided into a dna binding and an oligomerization domain . these domains can be either adjacent to each other or separated by a few amino acids . in the present case the two parts of the _PROTEIN_ domain are separated by a stretch of basic amino acids that constitute the _LOCATION_ localization sequence . the n terminus of each protein although being considerably variable is extremely rich in hydroxylated amino acids and in alanine leucine and arginine and thus fulfils the classical features of chloroplast targeting sequences . taken together these findings indicate that this group of proteins has evolved before the monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants have split up . for the _PROTEIN_ protein encoded by the _GENE_ gene _METHOD_ fusion constructs of the entire gene product or the putative _LOCATION_ target peptide sequence were used to examine the localization of this protein . transient _PROTEIN_ of these fusion proteins in protoplasts from a light grown mesophyll cell suspension culture from arabidopsis thaliana showed that the _METHOD_ fused to the entire _GENE_ gene product is indeed targeted to both compartments . the dual localization confirmed that both of the targeting signals i.e . the n terminal _LOCATION_ target peptide and the nls were correctly predicted . however we observed that most of the recombinant protein was located inside the _LOCATION_ whereas the chloroplasts showed only weak _METHOD_ . we therefore fused only the putative _LOCATION_ target peptide to _METHOD_ and transformed protoplasts with this construct . as expected the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ coincided only with the chlorophyll _METHOD_ of the chloroplasts and no _LOCATION_ signal was observed .
predicted putative transcription _PROTEIN_ sequences of arabidopsis thaliana were obtained from the arabidopsis transcription _PROTEIN_ database . the gene names follow the _PROTEIN_ locus identifier and the annotation is based on tair . the different loci coding for putative transcription _PROTEIN_ of rice were obtained from the rice transcription _PROTEIN_ database . the rice genes were named according to the tigr locus identifier and the annotation is based on tigr . all predictions were based on a consensus prediction using a bayes method . for this individual predictions of chloroplast and mitochondrial target peptides were performed by several publicly available web services . these individual predictions were combined mathematically to a consensus score . in detail two complementary hypotheses for the location of a protein in the chloroplast _LOCATION_ were tested the hypothesis that a protein is located and the hypothesis that a protein is not located there given a positive prediction . for each prediction program the likelihoods i.e . the probability of a positive prediction _PROTEIN_ one or the other hypothesis were evaluated by considering its prediction data for sets of plant proteins with known subcellular localization . plant proteins for these test sets were selected from the uniprot database or the arabidopsis subcellular proteomic database . redundancy within the protein sets was reduced in a way that no two proteins shared greater than sequence identity . to combine the different methods it was assumed that their predictions are independent of each other . this assumption allowed us to compute the likelihood of the parameters given several prediction data simply as product of the individual likelihoods . the ratio of the posterior probabilities of both hypotheses was computed by \frac { { p } } { { p } } \frac { { p { \prod\limits_ { i } n { p { { w_ { i } } } } } } } { { p { \prod\limits_ { i } n { p { { w_ { i } } } } } } } where c is the location of a protein in the chloroplast or _LOCATION_ respectively and a to a n are the individual positive predictions . based on predictions for the whole genomes of a. thaliana and o. sativa the chloroplast targeted and _LOCATION_ targeted proteins were estimated to constitute and of all open reading frames . p for chloroplast targeting was set accordingly to and p for _LOCATION_ targeting to . the weight w i is given by the score value of the corresponding prediction program and was normalized to a value between and . _METHOD_ without scoring can be viewed as a special case of weighting where weights are restricted to either or . the logarithm in base of the ratio that resulted from this calculation was used as consensus score value . to show an improvement of this consensus method over each of the individual methods that contribute to it the specificities of all methods were compared by applying them to the plant protein test sets described earlier . the specificity depends on the score value threshold chosen for an individual prediction program . in general a higher threshold generates a higher specificity but sacrifices sensitivity . therefore the comparison of the specificities was based on a common reference sensitivity value . the specificity was evaluated after trimming the method score threshold to a value that results in a reference sensitivity of . this reference sensitivity was used for all further calculations . protein and translated est databases were examined for sequences homologous to arabidopsis transcription _PROTEIN_ using the blastp and tblastn tools of the blast program . the sequences were aligned using the clustal x program . the sequence alignments were subsequently inspected and edited by hand as recommended by harrison and langdale using the graphical multiple sequence alignment editor in order to obtain optimal alignment and eliminate gap rich stretches . _LOCATION_ localization sequences were identified with the _METHOD_ predictnls and psort . unrooted trees were prepared by the neighbor joining method using clustal x and treeview with replicates performed for obtaining bootstrap confidence values . the measure for the distances between sequences was percent divergence . the entire cdna sequence and the sequence corresponding only to the _LOCATION_ target peptide respectively were amplified by pcr using isolated cdna from arabidopsis . the pcr products were subsequently cloned sequenced and then inserted in frame in front of the _METHOD_ coding sequence using the binary gateway vector pbattl b _METHOD_ that contains a double promoter . protoplasts from arabidopsis thaliana were produced from arabidopsis light grown suspension culture cells according to the protocol of negrutiu et al . . the recombinant plasmids with the _METHOD_ fusion constructs were introduced into the protoplasts using peg mediated transformation . transiently transformed cells were analyzed for _METHOD_ _METHOD_ using a _METHOD_ microscope .
