we have previously identified a zinc metalloprotease involved in the degradation of mitochondrial and chloroplast targeting peptides the presequence protease . in the arabidopsis thaliana genomic database there are two genes that correspond to the protease the zinc metalloprotease and the putative zinc metalloprotease . we have named the corresponding proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ show significant differences in their targeting peptides and the proteins are predicted to be localized in different compartments . _PROTEIN_ was shown to degrade both mitochondrial and chloroplast targeting peptides and to be dual targeted to both organelles using an ambiguous targeting peptide . here we have overexpressed purified and characterized proteolytic and targeting properties of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ exhibits different proteolytic subsite specificity from _PROTEIN_ when used for degradation of organellar targeting peptides and their mutants . interestingly _PROTEIN_ precursor protein was also found to be dual targeted to both mitochondria and chloroplasts in a single and dual in vitro import system . furthermore targeting peptide of the _PROTEIN_ dually targeted green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ to both mitochondria and chloroplasts in tobacco protoplasts and leaves using an in vivo transient _PROTEIN_ system . the targeting of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteases to chloroplasts in a. thaliana in vivo was confirmed via a shotgun _METHOD_ spectrometric analysis of highly purified chloroplasts . reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are differentially _PROTEIN_ in mature a. thaliana plants . phylogenetic evidence indicated that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are recent gene duplicates that may have diverged through subfunctionalization .
the _PROTEIN_ cdna encodes a protein of amino acids . single organelle intracellular prediction _METHOD_ mitoprot and chlorop predicted that the targeting peptide of _PROTEIN_ is amino acid residues long and the mature protein residues long . the mature portion of _PROTEIN_ was cloned as a fusion protein with glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ and the fusion protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was overexpressed in escherichia coli . the fusion protein was purified on a _PROTEIN_ ff column and the _PROTEIN_ was eluted after cleavage of the fusion protein with prescission protease . the recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein had an estimated molecular _METHOD_ of kda . the proteolytic action of the recombinant _PROTEIN_ was tested against a mitochondrial targeting peptide derived from the _PROTEIN_ synthase subunit from nicotianaplumbaginifolia and a chloroplastic targeting peptide derived from the small subunit of biphosphate _PROTEIN_ from nicotiana tabacum sstpnt . incubation of both targeting peptides with _PROTEIN_ resulted in complete degradation of the targeting peptides . addition of o phenanthroline a specific inhibitor of the metalloprotease completely abolished the proteolytic activity of _PROTEIN_ . these results show that _PROTEIN_ has a dual proteolytic function against both mitochondrial and chloroplastic targeting peptides . the cleavage specificity of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was studied by investigating cleavage of a specific _METHOD_ peptide the mitochondrial presequence peptide and the chloroplastic transit peptide of n.tabaccum small subunit of rubisco sstpnt . incubation periods were shortened in comparison with those used in fig . in order to detect formation of degradation intermediates . after incubation of the peptides for min at an intermediate product was produced by _PROTEIN_ with both the and peptide while no such intermediate product was seen when these two peptides were incubated with _PROTEIN_ . the intermediate could not be detected upon degradation with _PROTEIN_ even when much shorter incubation times and different concentrations of _PROTEIN_ were used . accumulation of intermediate products of the peptides after incubation with _PROTEIN_ shows that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have different cleavage specificity . degradation by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ has also been investigated with the chloroplastic transit peptide sstpnt and its mutants . mutants were designed to study the effect of changed flexibility of the transit peptide on import and processing . alternative processing has been detected with these mutants . _PROTEIN_ had the capacity to degrade both sstpnt and all the mutants whereas _PROTEIN_ could not degrade the mutant with _PROTEIN_ flexibility as proline has been changed to alanine . these results additionally confirm the different cleavage specificity of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . most sequence differences between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were found in their targeting peptides . whereas _PROTEIN_ was predicted to be a mitochondrial protein by both targetp and predotar _METHOD_ designed to predict intracellular organellar targeting ability _PROTEIN_ was suggested to be a chloroplastic protein . in order to study the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ in vitro import of the _PROTEIN_ precursor was studied into isolated chloroplasts and mitochondria . incubation of the _PROTEIN_ precursor protein with isolated chloroplasts resulted in import and processing of the precursor form of the protein to the mature sized product . the mature form was resistant to thermolysin treatment evidence that _PROTEIN_ was fully translocated and processed in the chloroplasts . the additional protein band below _PROTEIN_ is clearly different from that of the mature sized protein produced after import and processing and is not imported nor bound to mitochondria or chloroplasts as it disappears after pre incubation and washing of organelles . incubation of the _PROTEIN_ precursor protein with isolated mitochondria also resulted in import and processing of the precursor to the mature size product . the imported precursor and mature form of the _PROTEIN_ protein were resistant to proteinase k treatment showing import of _PROTEIN_ into mitochondria . furthermore import of the _PROTEIN_ precursor into mitochondria was dependent on _LOCATION_ potential as neither the pk resistant form of the precursor nor the mature protein was detected in the presence of an ionophore valinomycin . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ might be a dually targeted protein to both chloroplasts and mitochondria . import of the _PROTEIN_ precursor was also tested using the dual in vitro import system in which the precursor is simultaneously incubated with both isolated organelles . under these conditions _PROTEIN_ was imported and processed in both mitochondria and chloroplasts . the mature form of _PROTEIN_ generated after processing of the precursor was resistant in both organelles to externally added thermolysin showing dual import of _PROTEIN_ and additionally supporting dual localization of _PROTEIN_ . dual import of the _PROTEIN_ into mitochondria and chloroplasts was investigated further in vivo using _METHOD_ fusion and transient _PROTEIN_ in tobacco protoplasts and leaves . the targeting peptide and amino acid residues from the mature part of the _PROTEIN_ protein were fused to _METHOD_ under the strong plant transcription promoter . seventy amino acids from the mature part of the _PROTEIN_ were fused in order to preserve the native processing site . a known mitochondrial targeting peptide of the _PROTEIN_ synthase subunit from n. plumbaginifolia fused to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was used as a control for mitochondrial targeting . transient _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was performed in tobacco protoplasts and targeting was analyzed by confocal microscopy . protoplasts transformed with the _METHOD_ construct targeted _METHOD_ to small punctuated shape structures . these small punctuated structures were also labeled by the red _METHOD_ of mitotracker . co localization of _METHOD_ with mitotracker is shown in the yellow merged image in fig . c. _METHOD_ alone was found to be present all over in the _LOCATION_ . when protoplasts were transformed with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct _METHOD_ was found to be localized in two different locations the punctuated structures and large round structures . _METHOD_ in the punctuated structures co localized with mitotracker while _METHOD_ in the large round structures co localized with chloroplast _METHOD_ . these results showed that the targeting peptide of _PROTEIN_ can target _METHOD_ to both mitochondria and chloroplasts in vivo and support the dual localization of _PROTEIN_ . we have shown earlier that the prep is present in both mitochondria and chloroplasts in different plant species using antibodies raised against an amino acid residue peptide in the c terminal portion of the enzyme . however these antibodies do not distinguish between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as the antigenic peptide is identical in both enzymes . we also tested cross reactivity of the _PROTEIN_ antibodies raised against the full length _PROTEIN_ and found that these antibodies also recognized both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . a random bottom up analysis of isolated intact a. thaliana chloroplasts was carried out in order to identify the proteases . one peptide corresponding to _PROTEIN_ was repeatedly found with the highest score however several other unique peptides with lower confidence scores were also identified for both the _PROTEIN_ and atprep proteins . these results suggest that under these growth conditions both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are present in the arabidopsis chloroplasts isolated under the highly stringent conditions . unfortunately this methodology can not be used to give quantitative information although abundant proteins such as rubisco certainly provide more abundant trypsin derived peptides . _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts was studied in week old seedlings and in different organs in mature a. thaliana plants by a semi quantitative rt pcr method . pcr conditions were carefully optimized for the quantitative measurements of the transcripts level . both the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts were detected in the week old seedlings employing cycles of pcr . for the quantitative measurements of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts it was found that ng of total rna with cycles of pcr yielded quantitative measurements of the transcripts . constitutively _PROTEIN_ actin was used as an internal control . the _PROTEIN_ transcript was detected only in silique and flower although the transcript level was much higher in the inflorescence . in contrast to _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ transcript was detected in leaf flower and root with no transcript detected in silique and shoot . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ in a differential organ specific manner . a gene family consisting of close and long distance homologs of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was built by combining information from three sources . the gene families from the _PROTEIN_ evolution database were supplemented with longer distance blast hits from genbank and near full length homologs that could be manually assembled from a blast search against the ncbi _PROTEIN_ sequence tag collection . the sequences in this gene family were used to calculate a multiple sequence alignment using poa and to build a phylogenetic tree using mrbayes . this tree shows _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to be close relatives and suggests the importance of searching for close homologs of these proteins in other brassicaceae species .
