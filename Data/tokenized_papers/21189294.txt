the _LOCATION_ pore complex facilitates nucleocytoplasmic transport a crucial process for various cellular activities . the npc comprises nucleoporins and is well characterized in vertebrates and yeast . however only eight plant nucleoporins have been identified and little information is available about the complete molecular structure of plant npcs . in this study an interactive proteomic approach was used to identify arabidopsis thaliana nucleoporins . a series of five cycles of interactive proteomic analysis was performed using green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged nucleoporins . the identified nucleoporins were then cloned and subcellular localization analyses were performed . we found that the plant npc contains at least nucleoporins of which had not been previously annotated . surprisingly plant nucleoporins shared a similar domain organization to their vertebrate and yeast counterparts . moreover the plant nucleoporins exhibited higher sequence homology to vertebrate nucleoporins than to yeast nucleoporins . plant npcs lacked seven components _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ that were present in vertebrate npcs . however plants possessed a nucleoporin _PROTEIN_ that contained phe gly repeats and sequence analysis failed to identify a vertebrate homolog for this protein . interestingly _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed greater mobility on the _LOCATION_ envelope than did other nucleoporins and a _PROTEIN_ deficiency caused various defects in plant development . these findings provide valuable new information about plant npc structure and function .
the nucleoporin _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is encoded by a wide range of plant genomes and is known to function in mrna export and spindle assembly in tobacco and vertebrates . transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tagged arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ were generated to analyze the npc in living cells . imaging indicated that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized predominantly to the _LOCATION_ envelope in root tip cells . the _LOCATION_ surface exhibited dot like _METHOD_ signals which were similar to the npc _METHOD_ signals obtained from other eukaryotes . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localizes to the npc . anti _METHOD_ antibody was used to immunoprecipitate detergent solubilized fractions from wild type and transgenic _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants . immunoprecipitates were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ followed by either silver staining or immunoblot analysis with anti _METHOD_ antibody . a single band on the immunoblot confirmed the presence of intact _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the immunoprecipitate . silver staining indicated that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ sample contained numerous bands that were not present in the wild type sample suggesting that the immunoprecipitate contained many components of the npc . to identify the proteins present in the immunoprecipitate _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis was performed using an ltq orbitrap for in gel and in solution digestions . a total of proteins were identified in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ sample each containing one or more of the peptides detected in the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis . however none of these proteins were present in the wild type immunoprecipitate . the arabidopsis proteins were compared with databases containing metazoan nucleoporin sequences and proteins were identified as candidate nucleoporins based on sequence similarity . these were named according to their size and similarity to human nucleoporins . to determine whether the nucleoporin candidates localize to the _LOCATION_ envelope cdnas and/or genes encoding these proteins were cloned . the gene encoding was incorrectly registered as two independent genes in the arabidopsis genome database . constructs encoding _METHOD_ nucleoporin fusion proteins were prepared for of the nucleoporins and these _PROTEIN_ constructs were transiently _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts derived from cultured arabidopsis cells . in addition constructs encoding _METHOD_ tagged nucleoporins were generated and then _PROTEIN_ stably in transgenic arabidopsis lines . with the exception of _METHOD_ all of the stably _PROTEIN_ nucleoporins localized specifically to the _LOCATION_ envelope . _METHOD_ was found on the _LOCATION_ envelope and in dot like structures within the cytoplasm . in addition to _LOCATION_ envelope localization most transiently _PROTEIN_ nucleoporins were distributed within the cytoplasm and/or nucleoplasm . this distribution pattern is consistent with that of endogenous nucleoporins in cultured animal cells . the localization of transiently _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ differed from that of the other nucleoporins as it was not detected on the _LOCATION_ envelope but rather in the nucleoplasm . however this unexpected localization pattern might represent an artifact caused by the _METHOD_ tag . the anti _METHOD_ antibody coimmunoprecipitated endogenous _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ tagged nucleoporins _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the detergent solubilized fraction . in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ amino acids to show similarity to the corresponding region of human _PROTEIN_ which suggests that _PROTEIN_ is an npc component on the _LOCATION_ envelope . in _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis exhibited the highest mascot score which indicates that among the identified candidates is most likely to interact with _PROTEIN_ . extracts prepared from a transgenic plant stably _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were immunoprecipitated and then subjected to a second _METHOD_ spectrometric analysis . _METHOD_ coimmunoprecipitated with nucleoporins of which were identified in the immunoprecipitate of plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the remaining nucleoporin was identified as _GENE_ for which amino acids to show similarity to the corresponding region of human . arabidopsis was found to produce another homolog _GENE_ which exhibits sequence similarity to _GENE_ . a _PROTEIN_ domain is found in both of these arabidopsis proteins and in human . therefore _GENE_ and _GENE_ were designated as and respectively . to determine the localization of and _METHOD_ fusion constructs of these proteins were stably and transiently _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ localized to the nucleoplasm rather than to the _LOCATION_ envelope a finding consistent with localization in other eukaryotes . following immunoprecipitation of extract from transgenic plants stably _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ we performed a third _METHOD_ spectrometric analysis . _METHOD_ coimmunoprecipitated with one nucleoporin and seven nucleocytoplasmic transport _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ . this result suggests that is involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport via its interactions with importins and ran rather than by forming part of the npc scaffolding . the arabidopsis genome database was queried with human nucleoporin sequences and a specific motif for the nucleoporins identified as and which were not detected in the coimmunoprecipitation analysis of _METHOD_ tagged nucleoporins . _METHOD_ localized to the _LOCATION_ envelope in both transgenic plants and protoplasts . a fourth _METHOD_ spectrometric analysis showed that _METHOD_ coimmunoprecipitated with nucleoporins indicating that is a component of the plant npc . arabidopsis has a molecular _METHOD_ of kd and contains a mitotic phosphoprotein n end domain which is also found in human . neither _METHOD_ nor _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ successfully in arabidopsis cells suggesting that the _METHOD_ tagged may be unstable in vivo . summary of arabidopsis nucleoporins identified _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was immunoprecipitated with either _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ which functions as a negative regulator of cold signaling is distributed throughout the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ of arabidopsis . we found that _PROTEIN_ contains a region with homology to vertebrate nucleoporin embryonic large molecule derived from yolk sac which is critical for recruiting the _PROTEIN_ complex to chromatin . _PROTEIN_ homologs are found in the genome databases of other higher plants . however it is interesting to note that these homologs are almost half the molecular size of vertebrate elys proteins . taken together the results suggest that _PROTEIN_ may perform similar functions to elys acting as a component of plant npcs . lamins are a major component of the _LOCATION_ laminae on the interior of the _LOCATION_ envelope in vertebrates . although no lamin gene homologs have been detected in plant genomes a filamentous lattice similar to vertebrate lamina was identified by ultrastructural analysis of the _LOCATION_ envelope of tobacco . citation reported that this filamentous structure was attached to the inner _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and linked to the npc which indicates a physical interaction between these structures . recently little _LOCATION_ proteins have been identified as potential lamin like proteins in arabidopsis . linc proteins are predicted to form a large coiled coil region similar to that observed in vertebrate lamin proteins and they are involved in the _PROTEIN_ of _LOCATION_ morphology . however we were unable to identify linc or filamentous proteins with a long coiled coil region from our interactive proteomics studies using _METHOD_ tagged nucleoporins . our failure to detect these components could be due to technical limitations of the interactive proteomics method used . in this study eight known plant nucleoporins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and novel nucleoporins were isolated from arabidopsis and characterized . these arabidopsis nucleoporins show homology to human nucleoporins . however seven human npcs _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ do not appear to have homologs in the genome databases of higher plants including arabidopsis poplar grape and rice . the absence of these nucleoporins might account for differences in size between plant and vertebrate npcs _PROTEIN_ . higher sequence similarity scores and lower e values were obtained for sequence homologies between arabidopsis and human nucleoporins than between arabidopsis and yeast nucleoporins . this finding suggests that the npc structure of arabidopsis is more similar to the human npc structure than to the yeast structure . on the other hand the domain organization of each nucleoporin was similar in arabidopsis human and yeast which indicates a similar npc architecture among these _METHOD_ . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ immunoprecipitation technique allowed identification of _PROTEIN_ a kd nucleoporin with a sequence unique to higher plants . in a recent study yeast two hybrid screening revealed that _PROTEIN_ interacts with the mrna export complex and in that study _PROTEIN_ was named arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ homologs are present in various plants but not in yeast or vertebrates which suggests that _PROTEIN_ is unique to higher plant species . _PROTEIN_ has _PROTEIN_ repeats in the c terminal region but contains no other known functional motifs . the _PROTEIN_ repeats mediate the translocation of transport _PROTEIN_ cargo complexes through the npc by interacting with transport _PROTEIN_ . the presence of such repeats in _PROTEIN_ suggests that this protein may be required for active transport through the npc . in transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized to the _LOCATION_ envelope and coimmunoprecipitated with three nucleoporins and four importin proteins . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is incorporated into the npc and that it interacts with importin proteins . to determine if _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is mobile on the _LOCATION_ envelope _METHOD_ recovery after photobleaching analysis was performed in transgenic tobacco by cells . _METHOD_ tagged nucleoporins from each subcomplex of the npc were also selected and _PROTEIN_ as controls . after the _LOCATION_ envelopes of interphase cells were subjected to photobleaching _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ recovered whereas the _METHOD_ of other nucleoporins did not . this finding suggests that unlike other nucleoporins _PROTEIN_ interacts dynamically with the npc on the _LOCATION_ envelope . the subcellular dynamics of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were investigated in tobacco by cells to determine how _PROTEIN_ disassembles and reassembles during mitosis . figure shows confocal time lapse microscopy of cells stably _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ together with tdtomato a vital marker for chromatin dna . at interphase specific _LOCATION_ envelope labeling of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was present . at metaphase _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was dispersed throughout the _LOCATION_ and no membranous structures were observed . at early anaphase _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labeled particle like structures were detected in the _LOCATION_ . subsequently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in membranous structures around each chromosome in daughter cells . by the end of telophase _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ labeled the _LOCATION_ envelopes of each daughter cell and cytoplasmic pools were almost entirely depleted . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ disassembles and disperses into the _LOCATION_ pool during _LOCATION_ envelope breakdown and then reassembles as the _LOCATION_ envelope _METHOD_ in daughter cells . to determine the physiological role of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ two t dna insertion mutant lines _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were isolated . rt pcr analysis revealed that no full length _PROTEIN_ transcripts were present in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . the _PROTEIN_ mutants showed developmental defects . although the plants grew normally before bolting the _PROTEIN_ mutants exhibited an early flowering phenotype . under long day conditions the mutants produced fewer rosette leaves _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ than wild type plants at bolting . the early flowering phenotype has been observed previously in arabidopsis nucleoporin mutants including _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and tpr/nua . the tpr/nua mutant contains significantly reduced levels of several micrornas _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ that are important for regulating flowering time . taken together these results suggest that _LOCATION_ pores are involved in the transport of unknown _PROTEIN_ that might determine flowering time in arabidopsis . the _PROTEIN_ mutants produced stunted fruits with substantially fewer mature seed grains _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ than the wild type . some _PROTEIN_ pollen grains were shrunken and an in vitro pollen germination assay showed significantly lower germination rates for _PROTEIN_ pollen _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ than the wild type . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is important for proper pollen development which is required for seed production . transport receptors export mrna from the _LOCATION_ and these receptors interact specifically with nucleoporins in the npc . arabidopsis nucleoporins including _PROTEIN_ and tpr/nua are involved in mrna export from the _LOCATION_ . to determine the functional role played by _PROTEIN_ in mrna export in situ hybridization analysis was performed with oligo probes to localize poly rna in wild type arabidopsis and _PROTEIN_ mutants . a higher _LOCATION_ poly rna signal was detected in the leaf cells of _PROTEIN_ mutants than in those of the wild type which suggests that in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ is required for mrna export through the npc . this result is consistent with a previous study . arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ was also found to regulate _LOCATION_ morphology . in rosette leaf epidermal cells from the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants the _LOCATION_ were more spherical and uniform than those in wild type plants exhibiting a shorter major axis and a higher circularity index . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is required for wild type _LOCATION_ morphology .

tool in the tmhmm server smc_prok_a and smc_prok_b of tpr/nua were listed in the tigr rice genome annotation resource and _PROTEIN_ type zinc finger of was listed in uniprot . genomic dnas and cdnas

vector pentr/d topo . to generate the dna construct for histone tdtomato the cloned cdna was transferred from the entry vector to destination vector pgwtd by an lr reaction . protoplasts derived from
