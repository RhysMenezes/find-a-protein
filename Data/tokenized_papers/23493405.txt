asparagine linked glycosylation of proteins is an essential cotranslational and posttranslational protein modification in plants . the central step in this process is the transfer of a preassembled oligosaccharide to nascent proteins in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ by the oligosaccharyltransferase complex . despite the importance of the catalyzed reaction the composition and the function of individual ost subunits are still ill defined in plants . here we report the function of the highly conserved ost subunit _PROTEIN_ . we have identified a mutant in the _PROTEIN_ gene that causes overall underglycosylation of proteins and affects the biogenesis of the receptor kinase ef tu receptor involved in innate immunity and the endo _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ required for cellulose biosynthesis . notably the _PROTEIN_ mutation does not affect mutant variants of the receptor kinase brassinosteroid . _PROTEIN_ deficiency results in activation of the unfolded protein response and causes hypersensitivity to salt/osmotic stress and to the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin . consistent with its role in protein glycosylation _PROTEIN_ resides in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and interacts with other subunits of the ost complex . together our findings reveal the importance of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ for the efficient glycosylation of specific glycoproteins involved in different physiological processes and shed light on the composition and function of the plant ost complex .
the pattern recognition receptor _PROTEIN_ senses bacteria through recognition of the pathogen associated molecular pattern _PROTEIN_ ef tu resulting in _PROTEIN_ triggered immunity . a forward genetic screen aimed at the discovery of proteins involved in the biogenesis and function of _PROTEIN_ resulted in the identification of insensitive mutants . one mutant was mapped to an approximately kb region on the bottom of chromosome i . sequencing of candidate genes in this region identified a single base pair change in the intronless open reading frame of _GENE_ introducing a premature stop codon . _GENE_ encodes a amino acid protein with a predicted n terminal signal peptide a lumenal domain and four c terminal transmembrane helices . an amino acid sequence alignment and in silico prediction of a conserved _LOCATION_ protein topology suggest that _GENE_ encodes a plant homolog of which are known subunits of the yeast ost complex . consequently we renamed as _PROTEIN_ and refer to the gene product of _GENE_ as _PROTEIN_ . apart from _PROTEIN_ the arabidopsis genome contains another intronless gene coding for a putative ortholog of yeast that is here referred to as _PROTEIN_ . the amino acid sequence of _PROTEIN_ displays identity to _PROTEIN_ and the overall protein topology is conserved between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . extraction of data from microarray experiments reveals that _PROTEIN_ is widely _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis and _PROTEIN_ transcript _PROTEIN_ correlates well with the _PROTEIN_ of other genes coding for ost subunits like _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in contrast _PROTEIN_ displays organ specific _PROTEIN_ with low levels in whole seedlings higher _PROTEIN_ levels in _METHOD_ and stamens and no clear coexpression with genes for other ost subunits . measurement of seedling growth inhibition in response to treatment suggested that the biogenesis and/or the function of the leu rich repeat receptor kinase _PROTEIN_ are compromised in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . in contrast seedling growth inhibition mediated by that is recognized by the related lrr rk _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was similar to wild type plants showing that _PROTEIN_ is sensitive to treatment similar to efr and the previously characterized _PROTEIN_ mutant . consistent with this findings the oxidative burst triggered by was almost abolished while oxidative bursts triggered by two other _PROTEIN_ and chitin _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were not drastically altered . to test whether induced resistance to the bacterial pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv tomato is also affected in _PROTEIN_ we pretreated plants with and investigated the inhibition of pathogen growth . notably induced bacterial resistance was severely impaired in the mutant while pretreatment with did not alter the growth of pto in _PROTEIN_ . interestingly the _PROTEIN_ mutation led to an increase in susceptibility toward the hypovirulent strain pto _PROTEIN_ upon spray infection comparable to that caused by loss of _PROTEIN_ . since _PROTEIN_ is heavily glycosylated we hypothesized that n glycosylation of _PROTEIN_ is altered in the _PROTEIN_ mutant potentially leading to altered accumulation and/or function of _PROTEIN_ . we generated _PROTEIN_ efr double mutants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ under the control of the native promoter . immunoblot analysis monitoring the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ levels revealed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulation is reduced in independent homozygous _PROTEIN_ efr _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines when compared with efr _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . these observations show that _PROTEIN_ function is required for _PROTEIN_ biogenesis similar to previously described mutants with defects in glycosylation or _LOCATION_ quality control . the introduction of a premature stop codon by the _PROTEIN_ mutation suggests that a truncated amino acid protein is generated that is not fully functional . consequently we hypothesized that a deficiency in _PROTEIN_ causes alterations in protein n glycosylation leading to protein underglycosylation a defect that has already been described previously for other arabidopsis ost subunit mutants . first we analyzed the overall n glycosylation profile of glycoproteins extracted from rosette leaves . the total n glycan pool was unchanged showing that the mutant does not affect the biosynthesis or processing of n glycans . however _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ separation and subsequent immunoblot analysis with antibodies against complex n glycans revealed an overall reduced signal intensity indicating the presence of lower amounts of complex n glycans . a lectin blot with concanavalin a which binds _PROTEIN_ to terminal mannosyl and _PROTEIN_ residues of glycoproteins showed that the mobility of individual bands is altered . immunoblotting with protein specific antibodies demonstrated that the _LOCATION_ resident protein disulfide isomerase which harbors two n glycosylation sites and is commonly used as a reporter to monitor underglycosylation is not affected in _PROTEIN_ . by contrast in the _PROTEIN_ mutant which is deficient in the last biosynthetic step of the lipid linked oligosaccharide assembly and consequently displays reduced glycosylation efficiency faster migrating pdi _METHOD_ were detectable upon _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ separation . another glycoprotein thioglucoside _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ containing four asn linked glycans displayed higher mobility in _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type indicating that _PROTEIN_ is hypoglycosylated in _PROTEIN_ . the restoration of complex n glycan formation due to reduced or completely impaired glycosylation of a misfolded n acetylglucosaminyltransferase i _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein is another sensitive tool to monitor alterations in glycosylation efficiency in arabidopsis mutants . we crossed _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ plants and analyzed the generation of complex n glycans in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . consistent with a role of _PROTEIN_ in the glycosylation of proteins we detected the restoration of complex n glycosylation in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which was not observed in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ control plants that contain a _PROTEIN_ null allele instead of the leaky _PROTEIN_ allele . this finding provides evidence that n glycosylation site occupancy of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is also reduced in the _PROTEIN_ genetic background . underglycosylation caused by genetic lesions or chemical treatment with tunicamycin triggers the unfolded protein response . to monitor induction of the upr in _PROTEIN_ we performed quantitative reverse transcription pcr and monitored the _PROTEIN_ of genes coding for _LOCATION_ resident proteins that are typically activated during _LOCATION_ stress . as for _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ of genes for binding proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a calreticulin and a pdi _PROTEIN_ was significantly increased in _PROTEIN_ suggesting that the defect in _PROTEIN_ triggers the activation of the upr similar to _PROTEIN_ deficient plants . the deficiency of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ affects the biogenesis and function of _PROTEIN_ but _METHOD_ to have little effect on the response mediated by the related heavily glycosylated lrr rk _PROTEIN_ . to investigate whether proper _PROTEIN_ function is required for the biogenesis or functionality of mutant variants of the lrr rk _PROTEIN_ we crossed _PROTEIN_ to the weak _PROTEIN_ alleles _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and analyzed the suppression or enhancement of the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ dwarf phenotype . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants contain mutant alleles of the _PROTEIN_ gene and _PROTEIN_ structurally altered but still functional _PROTEIN_ proteins that are retained in the _LOCATION_ by different quality control processes including glycan dependent _METHOD_ . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants were indistinguishable from _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ revealing that underglycosylation in _PROTEIN_ neither rescues the _PROTEIN_ phenotypes nor enhances their growth phenotypes . this finding suggests that the mutated _PROTEIN_ variants are not substrates of _PROTEIN_ . another candidate protein that is sensitive to alterations in glycosylation is the endo _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which plays a yet unclear role during cell wall formation and cellulose synthesis . _PROTEIN_ has eight potential glycosylation sites in its _LOCATION_ domain and genetic interactions of the weak _PROTEIN_ allele _PROTEIN_ with different n glycan processing mutants indicate that n glycans play a crucial role for _PROTEIN_ . we analyzed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by immunoblotting in _PROTEIN_ and found that _PROTEIN_ accumulation is considerably reduced in the mutant . next we tested if _PROTEIN_ deficiency enhances the phenotype of _PROTEIN_ . in comparison with _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant displayed a severe growth phenotype with very short roots similar to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in summary our data show that _PROTEIN_ function is required for _PROTEIN_ biogenesis presumably by assisting in the transfer of oligosaccharides to selected _PROTEIN_ glycosylation sites . although the _PROTEIN_ plants display a severe underglycosylation defect these plants do not show any developmental or morphological phenotype under normal growth conditions . underglycosylation mutants are frequently more sensitive to salt stress and tunicamycin an inhibitor of protein glycosylation . germination of _PROTEIN_ on medium containing mm nacl resulted in _PROTEIN_ root growth . increased sensitivity to nacl was also observed when d old seedlings were transferred to murashige and skoog _METHOD_ medium supplemented with mm nacl and grown for an additional d . these effects were even more pronounced under higher salt concentrations . when _PROTEIN_ was grown for weeks on _METHOD_ medium supplemented with mm mannitol swelling of roots and enhanced _PROTEIN_ root formation were observed . transfer of d old _PROTEIN_ seedlings to _METHOD_ plates containing tunicamycin resulted in the formation of an increased number of pale seedlings . a germination assay confirmed that _PROTEIN_ is much more sensitive to tunicamycin than wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants . in a previous study it was found that the _PROTEIN_ mutant which displays underglycosylation of proteins due to a defect in the biosynthesis of the oligosaccharide precursor is more sensitive to nacl tunicamycin and abscisic acid . to investigate differences in aba sensitivity we performed a germination assay in the presence of two different aba concentrations . in contrast to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ germination was not impaired by aba . we could not identify additional _PROTEIN_ alleles in our forward genetic screen and there are no _PROTEIN_ transfer dna knockout mutants available to corroborate that the detected phenotypes are caused by _PROTEIN_ deficiency . to confirm that the observed phenotypes are indeed caused by the molecular lesion in _PROTEIN_ we _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the control of its native promoter in _PROTEIN_ . immunoblot analysis using anti _PROTEIN_ antibody revealed that the underglycosylation defect was restored in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants . consistent with this finding the transgenic seedlings were as tolerant to increased salt concentrations as wild type plants and induced seedling growth inhibition was triggered in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . restoration of _PROTEIN_ glycosylation was also observed when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ under the control of the gene promoter in _PROTEIN_ . by contrast _PROTEIN_ of neither _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ nor _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ resulted in the compensation of the _PROTEIN_ glycosylation defect . it is interesting that no _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ could be detected in these transgenic lines by immunoblotting suggesting that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is not properly _PROTEIN_ at all or is highly unstable compared with _PROTEIN_ . to analyze the molecular defect caused by the _PROTEIN_ mutation in more detail we performed qrt pcr analysis . _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were clearly reduced in seedlings and leaves suggesting that the nonsense mutation in _PROTEIN_ leads to _PROTEIN_ mrna decay . to assess whether the truncated protein can be produced in plants we generated a construct where the amino acid _PROTEIN_ protein is fused to _METHOD_ and transiently _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein in nicotiana benthamiana . immunoblot analysis with antibodies against _METHOD_ confirmed the stable production of the truncated variant when _PROTEIN_ under the control of heterologous regulatory sequences . next we tested whether the topology of _PROTEIN_ is altered due to the absence of the c terminal domain . to this end we analyzed the glycosylation status of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ contains a single n glycosylation site at position asn in the large lumenal domain that is also present in _PROTEIN_ . digestion with endoglycosidase h or peptide n glycosidase f caused shifts in mobility upon _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ separation indicative of _PROTEIN_ glycosylation with an oligomannosidic n glycan . the presence of endo h sensitive _METHOD_ revealed that the large n terminal domain of _PROTEIN_ is also facing the _LOCATION_ lumen demonstrating that the protein topology is not altered due to the protein truncation . moreover the presence of an oligomannosidic n glycan further indicates that the truncated variant is like _PROTEIN_ retained in the _LOCATION_ and not processed by _LOCATION_ located glycosylation enzymes . confocal microscopy analysis confirmed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is predominantly located in the _LOCATION_ when transiently _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana . together these findings suggests that the reduced mrna levels in _PROTEIN_ contribute significantly to the observed _PROTEIN_ deficiency while the distinct role of the c terminal domain with three additional transmembrane helices for _PROTEIN_ function remains elusive . a role of _PROTEIN_ in protein glycosylation suggests that it localizes to the _LOCATION_ . to test this hypothesis we analyzed transgenic _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants by confocal laser scanning microscopy . however the _METHOD_ intensity was quite low and no distinct subcellular location could be seen . consequently we _PROTEIN_ transiently the _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ protein under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter in n. benthamiana leaves . analysis of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein by confocal microscopy of epidermal cells revealed a reticular distribution pattern resembling _LOCATION_ localization . to confirm this finding we coexpressed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with _PROTEIN_ caaats monomeric red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ which carries a mutated form of the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ and localizes _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ . in addition we performed colocalization experiments with other tagged ost subunits like _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and arabidopsis _METHOD_ a putative ortholog of yeast . all of the _PROTEIN_ proteins displayed _LOCATION_ like labeling and colocalization with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ consistent with a possible function of _PROTEIN_ as an ost subunit in the _LOCATION_ . in yeast it has been proposed that acts as a bridge and mediates the interaction of with the catalytic subunit . in addition was found to regulate the recruitment of either or into two distinct yeast ost subcomplexes . to further investigate whether _PROTEIN_ is part of such a complex and interacts with other ost subunits we transiently coexpressed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with tagged _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ in n. benthamiana leaves and performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments . in our first co ip experiment we coexpressed _PROTEIN_ ha with _METHOD_ . immunoblotting revealed the copurification of _PROTEIN_ ha . in subsequent experiments we observed the binding of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to _PROTEIN_ ha and the interaction of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with _METHOD_ . notably the interaction is not compromised when the truncated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ form is coexpressed instead of _PROTEIN_ . in summary our data suggest that _PROTEIN_ is part of an _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ subcomplex that has been described previously in yeast .
