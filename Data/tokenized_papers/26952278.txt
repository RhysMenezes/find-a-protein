as the start of a new life cycle activation of the first division of the zygote is a critical event in both plants and animals . because the zygote in plants is difficult to access our understanding of how this process is achieved remains poor . here we report genetic and cell biological analyses of the zygote arrest mutant in arabidopsis which showed zygote lethal and over accumulation of cyclin _PROTEIN_ d box gus in ovules . map based cloning showed that encodes the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome subunit _PROTEIN_ . live cell imaging studies showed that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in both egg and sperm cells in zygotes and during early embryogenesis . using a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion construct that fully complements we showed that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ persisted throughout the mitotic cell cycle and localized to cell plates during cytokinesis . _PROTEIN_ of non degradable cyclin _PROTEIN_ in the zygote or mutations of either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ also led to a like phenotype . biochemical studies showed that _PROTEIN_ has self ubiquitination activity and is able to ubiquitinate cyclin _PROTEIN_ and promote degradation of cyclin _PROTEIN_ . these results together suggest that apc/c mediated degradation of cyclin _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis is critical for initiating the first division of the zygote .
forty additional zygote lethal mutants were identified by differential interference contrast microscopy examination of embryo lethal ovules from a population of approximately a. thaliana plants mutagenized by ethyl methanesulfonate _METHOD_ treatment as described in xu et al . . in these mutants at least a fraction of embryos were arrested at the single cell zygote stage . since homozygous ovules are lethal all these mutants were _PROTEIN_ in a heterozygous state . after backcrossing to col for at least three generations detailed phenotypic analyses were performed in these mutants . the mutant was notable as it exhibited a cell cycle arrest phenotype . in aborted ovules showed developmental arrest of the embryo at the single cell zygote stage while others continued to one to three cycles of cell division before abortion . these arrested zygotes were mostly elongated and had visible cell walls . genetic analyses showed that of the ovules in siliques were aborted suggesting that the phenotype is caused by a single gene recessive mutation and the presence of either a maternal or a paternal allele is sufficient to initiate zygote division . reciprocal crosses between and col showed that transmission through the male was reduced slightly while through the female it was reduced significantly especially in indicating that plays a role in both microsporogenesis and megasporogenesis . the p value represents the probabilities for unbiased transmissions . p < indicates that the transmission efficiency was compromised . to characterize the defects in we introduced the _PROTEIN_ box uida _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ reporter construct to by crossing . as reported before the _PROTEIN_ box gus fusion protein is subjected to degradation at the cell cycle transition from metaphase to anaphase and thus cells with gus staining are about to exit mitosis . the gus activity in ovules excised from plants carrying a homozygous _PROTEIN_ box uida transgene was assessed . results showed that in the wild type plants gus staining was only observed in of ovules collected when embryos were at the pre globular stage . however gus staining was observed in of arrested ovules examined at the same stage . in addition gus staining in arrested ovules was more intense than in the wild type . such a _PROTEIN_ box gus over accumulation phenotype was observed in aborted ovules from but rarely in wild type looking ones in the same silique . these results suggest a cell cycle defect in defective ovules . using a population of approximately plants obtained from a cross between and a plant of the landsberg _LOCATION_ ecotype was mapped to a kb interval on chromosome . we screened t dna insertion lines of all annotated genes in this region and found that with a t dna inserted into the second intron of the annotated _GENE_ showed a similar zygote lethal phenotype as . we sequenced the genomic region of the gene in and identified a g to a point mutation that converted a highly conserved cysteine residue to tyrosine . reciprocal crosses between and failed to complement the mutant phenotype in the generation indicating that these two mutations are allelic . accordingly and were re named and respectively . after sequencing the transcript from cdna prepared from the wild type arabidopsis seedlings we found that the intron exon structure prediction for _PROTEIN_ in the tair and genbank databases was inaccurate with the presence of a single nucleotide exon missing and the inclusion of a bp intronic sequence in the cdna . as illustrated in figure the corrected gene encodes a bp transcript producing an amino acid polypeptide that showed high sequence similarity to _PROTEIN_ proteins from rice maize physcomitrella patens human zebrafish and talaromyces marneffei . _PROTEIN_ is a single gene in the arabidopsis genome which shares sequence identity at the amino acid level with _PROTEIN_ a component in the _PROTEIN_ box protein complex . to confirm if the mutation in _PROTEIN_ is responsible for the phenotype we generated _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs with the green _METHOD_ protein gene _METHOD_ inserted in frame respectively to the n or c terminus of the _PROTEIN_ coding region . the _PROTEIN_ fragment used consists of bp upstream bp coding and bp downstream sequences . these constructs were transformed to the wild type a. thaliana . several single insertion lines with detectable _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were obtained and crossed to plants . among the progenies obtained we identified homozygous plants carrying either _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . detailed examination of these plants revealed neither zygote nor embryo lethal phenotypes suggesting that these fusion constructs are functional and able to complement the phenotype . to access the _PROTEIN_ of transgenic plants carrying either _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ uida _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were examined . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ was observed in embryos at all stages examined while uida _PROTEIN_ in the endosperm was restricted to early stage ovules and declined when embryos reached the torpedo stage . during vegetative growth uida _PROTEIN_ was observed in all meristematic tissues examined in particular shoot and root apices and _PROTEIN_ root primordia . confocal microscopic examination showed that in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was observed in both embryo proper and suspensor cells . within these cells the _METHOD_ signal was present in both the _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm as reported previously . to define _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ more accurately we replaced the _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with a _LOCATION_ localized _METHOD_ to produce _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . transformation and progeny analyses showed that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct is also able to complement the mutant producing wild type appearing plants in the background . in these transgenic plants _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was detected from the tetrad stage to mature microspores during microsporogenesis . in mature and germinating pollen _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was only observed in sperm cells and barely in the vegetative _LOCATION_ . during megasporogenesis _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was continuously observed from megaspore mother cells to the mature embryo sac . to access the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ during double fertilization _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants were used to pollinate transgenic plants carrying egg cell specific _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . under a confocal microscope we observed the release of _METHOD_ labeled sperm into the embryo sac at h after pollination . at a slightly _PROTEIN_ stage fusion of the red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ labeled egg cell with _METHOD_ labeled sperm was observed producing a zygote with both green and red _METHOD_ . concurrently the fusion of non labeled central _LOCATION_ with the other _METHOD_ labeled sperm led to the formation of a _LOCATION_ with green _METHOD_ . the mendelian segregation of the recessive phenotype suggests that both maternal and paternal _PROTEIN_ alleles are active in zygotes . to confirm this at the transcriptional level reciprocal crosses between homozygous _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the wild type plants showed that indeed _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was observed in both the zygote and the central _LOCATION_ immediately after fertilization no matter whether the transgenic plant was used as male or female parent _LOCATION_ . when examined at about hap with pollens from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants zygotes showed _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . similarly when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants were pollinated with wild type pollen and examined in the same manner a similar ratio of _METHOD_ positive zygotes was observed . considering the variations in fertilization time in different ovules and the detectability of the _METHOD_ signal we believe that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in zygotes immediately after fertilization . it has been shown that several apc/c proteins exhibit dynamic changes in localization during the cell cycle . to find out if this is the case for _PROTEIN_ we crossed mcherry _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants . mcherry _PROTEIN_ decorated cytoskeletal configurations such as cortical microtubules pre prophase band mitotic spindle and phragmoplast in root meristematic cells . we observed that in cells at the interphase prophase and metaphase _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was distributed in both the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ as reported previously . however during anaphase and telophase in addition to the _LOCATION_ localization _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was observed in the mid plane of the forming cell plate indicating a role of _PROTEIN_ in cytokinesis . to address if _PROTEIN_ has ligase activity an in vitro ubiquitination assay was performed . a glutathione s transferase tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ construct was made and transformed to escherichia coli to purify the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ without _PROTEIN_ was produced and purified as a control . when _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was incubated in vitro with his tagged ubiquitin activating enzyme from wheat his tagged ubiquitin conjugating enzyme from human and his tagged ubiquitin from arabidopsis polyubiquitination of _PROTEIN_ was observed after min incubations and detected with either anti his or anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies . such a polyubiquitination was not observed in the control reaction with _PROTEIN_ . the polyubiquitination was saturated after min as the number and intensity of those ubiquitination bands did not increase further when the incubation time was extended . these polyubiquitination bands were not observed when either his his his ub or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was omitted from the reaction no matter what anti his or anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies were used . these results suggest that in the presence of and ubiquitin _PROTEIN_ is able to execute self polyubiquitination . we next addressed whether the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ is able to ubiquitinate and promote cyclin _PROTEIN_ degradation . a his _PROTEIN_ myc construct was made with the cyclin _PROTEIN_ cdna from arabidopsis fused with a n terminal his tag and a c terminal tag and transformed to e. coli . a his _PROTEIN_ myc fusion protein was purified using a ni agarose column . an in vitro ubiquitination assay was performed using his his his ub his _PROTEIN_ myc and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . polyubiquitination of the his _PROTEIN_ myc was detected using an anti myc antibody after incubation for min and the intensity of these polyubiquitination bands was increased when the incubation time was extended to min while no polyubiquitination was detected when _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was replaced by _PROTEIN_ . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is able to ubiquitinate cyclin _PROTEIN_ . we then addressed whether _PROTEIN_ promotes degradation of cyclin _PROTEIN_ . constructs of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ myc _PROTEIN_ under the camv promoter were made and transformed individually to nicotiana benthamiana leaves by infiltrations . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ myc proteins extracted from these leaves were mixed and the stability of _PROTEIN_ myc was monitored by western blot using an anti myc antibody . we observed that in the presence of _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ myc protein was rapidly degraded in a time dependent manner . in contrast when a proteasome inhibitor was added the _PROTEIN_ myc protein was much more stable . although such degradation was also observed in the control treatment when _PROTEIN_ was replaced by dimethyl sulfoxide _METHOD_ it was much slower than the reaction with _PROTEIN_ . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is able to ubiquitinate cyclin _PROTEIN_ to promote degradation of cyclin _PROTEIN_ . to address whether the zygote lethal phenotype in was caused by over accumulation of cyclin _PROTEIN_ we changed the d box in cyclin _PROTEIN_ from rqvlgdign to aqvagdign through pcr based site directed mutagenesis to generate _PROTEIN_ box with a uida reporter gene fused to its c terminus . it has been shown that cyclin _PROTEIN_ with a mutated d box is much more stable . the _PROTEIN_ box uida fusion construct made using an embryo specific promoter that is active from the zygote stage onwards was transformed to a. thaliana using the floral dip method . the _PROTEIN_ uida construct with the native cyclin _PROTEIN_ was made and transformed to a. thaliana as a control . phenotypic analyses of transgenic plants carrying _PROTEIN_ box uida showed that among lines examined six displayed an embryo lethal phenotype . further analyses in one of these lines under a dic microscope revealed that of ovules in siliques carried embryos arrested at the zygote stage and were at the two to eight cell stages . the zygote lethal phenotype with zygote elongation resembled the mutant . as a control no such phenotype was observed in any of these lines among the independent transgenic lines carrying _PROTEIN_ uida that were examined . the gus assay revealed that strong gus signals were consistently observed in ovules from plants carrying _PROTEIN_ box uida while only weak gus staining was occasionally observed in ovules from _PROTEIN_ uida plants . the strong gus staining is mostly observed in those small ovules from _PROTEIN_ box uida transgenic plants with a zygote lethal phenotype suggesting that compromised degradation of _PROTEIN_ box gus may have caused the zygote lethal phenotype . to find out if the zygote lethal phenotype in was caused by a general defect in apc/c we re examined ovules from _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . these mutants have been reported previously with defective female gametogenesis and embryogenesis but not a zygote lethal phenotype . when ovules from of _PROTEIN_ were cleared and examined under a dic microscope showed a female gamete defect and were embryo lethal among these were aborted at the zygote stage . similarly of ovules were aborted before fertilization and showed embryo lethality of these were arrested at the zygote stage . these zygote lethal phenotypes were indistinguishable from that of .
plants of a. thaliana ecotypes col and ler were grown at in a growth room with h light per day . a t dna insertion line was obtained from the nottingham arabidopsis stock centre . for mutagenesis col seeds were treated with _METHOD_ and screened for putative zygote lethal mutants in plants as described . was backcrossed to col for three generations before further analyses were carried out . for transmission analyses the number of and wild type progeny were counted in populations after reciprocal crosses . the transmission frequency was calculated as the number of heterozygous . map based cloning was performed in progeny from a cross between and ler . a point mutation was detected after sequencing candidate genes in a plant . for complementation and _PROTEIN_ analyses three constructs _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ uida were made using the full length _PROTEIN_ genomic sequence consisting of bp upstream bp coding region and bp downstream sequences with a _METHOD_ and uida in frame fused to the n or c terminus of _PROTEIN_ respectively . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was made by replacing the _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with the _METHOD_ . these constructs were introduced to arabidopsis by agrobacterium tumefaciens using the floral dip method . for in vitro biochemical analyses the full length _PROTEIN_ cdna was amplified from col seedlings using rt pcr and ligated to pgex and _METHOD_ to make _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ respectively . the coding sequence of cyclin _PROTEIN_ was amplified from col seedlings using rt pcr and introduced to to make _PROTEIN_ myc . _PROTEIN_ was amplified from _PROTEIN_ and ligated to to generate his _PROTEIN_ myc with a tag . for phenotypic analyses of non degradable _PROTEIN_ box transgenic plants cyclin _PROTEIN_ was introduced into peasy blunt and then the d box rqvlgdign in cyclin _PROTEIN_ was mutated to aqvagdign by pcr to make peasy blunt _PROTEIN_ box . for embryo specific _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the pcr products of the bp promoter and _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ box were inserted into pgreen ii with uida fused in frame . the primers used are listed in table . ovules at different stages were cleared and observed as reported . a confocal laser scanning microscope _METHOD_ was used to examine _METHOD_ and mcherry _PROTEIN_ in transgenic plants with nm and nm excitation lasers respectively . the gus assay was performed as described . in vitro ubiquitination assay was performed in a reaction consisting of mm amino propanediol _PROTEIN_ /hcl mm mm dtt mm _PROTEIN_ a crude extract of recombinant tagged wheat _PROTEIN_ ng of purified tagged human of tagged ubiquitin and purified _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as described . divided mixtures were incubated at for or min terminated by adding a loading buffer containing _PROTEIN_ and boiled for min before gel analysis . proteins were detected by western blot and visualized under the chemiluminescent imaging system . for in vitro protein degradation assays a. tumefaciens strains carrying _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ myc constructs were infiltrated to n. benthamiana leaves individually with at a ratio . three days after infiltration proteins were extracted using a native extraction buffer _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ myc was mixed with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ in a volume ratio of . _PROTEIN_ or was added to the reaction mixture to promote or inhibit the proteasome activity respectively . _METHOD_ at a final concentration of was used as the negative control . these mixtures were incubated at room temperature with gentle shaking at different time points for western blot analyses .
