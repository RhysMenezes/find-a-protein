despite considerable progress in our knowledge _PROTEIN_ the cell cycle inhibitor of the kip related protein family in plants less is known about the coordination of endoreduplication and cell differentiation . in animals the role of cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors as multifunctional _PROTEIN_ coordinating cell cycle regulation and cell differentiation is well documented and involves not only the inhibition of cdk/cyclin complexes but also other _METHOD_ among them the regulation of transcription . interestingly several plant krps have a punctuated distribution in the _LOCATION_ suggesting that they are associated with heterochromatin . here one of these chromatin bound krps _PROTEIN_ has been studied in arabidopsis . _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in endoreduplicating cells and loss of _PROTEIN_ function _PROTEIN_ endoreduplication indicating that _PROTEIN_ is a positive regulator of endoreduplication . this regulation relies on several _METHOD_ in addition to its role in cyclin/cdk kinase inhibition previously described chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data combined with transcript quantification provide evidence that _PROTEIN_ regulates the transcription of genes involved in cell wall organization . furthermore _PROTEIN_ overexpression increases chromocenter decondensation and endoreduplication in the arabidopsis trithorax related _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant which is deficient for the deposition of heterochromatin marks . hence _PROTEIN_ could bind chromatin to coordinately control endoreduplication and chromatin structure and allow the _PROTEIN_ of genes required for cell elongation .
plasmids developed by citation allowing the _PROTEIN_ of a _LOCATION_ targeted _METHOD_ under the control of a promoter of interest were used to study _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pattern . the _PROTEIN_ promoter was cloned upstream of a _LOCATION_ targeting fusion protein tagged with _METHOD_ and used for arabidopsis transformation . we next used these transgenic lines to correlate the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ with the distribution of dna content in rosette leaves which show the highest level of endoreduplication in arabidopsis . dna content per _LOCATION_ from whole rosettes of lines was measured and analyzed by flow cytometry simultaneously with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ at two different stages of development . in rosettes of d old plants _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was observed in about of the cells and was specifically enriched in endoreduplicating _LOCATION_ of _METHOD_ positive _LOCATION_ had a dna content of or higher . at _PROTEIN_ stages when most leaves had reached maturity of _LOCATION_ were labeled suggesting that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is associated with differentiation . furthermore the distribution of dna content in _METHOD_ positive _LOCATION_ was similar to the distribution observed in the whole population which contains a high proportion of and higher dna contents whereas the majority of _METHOD_ negative _LOCATION_ have a dna content . a profiling of plants _PROTEIN_ a _METHOD_ construct was done as a control to make sure that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ did not alter dna content distribution and that _METHOD_ did not accumulate preferentially in some _LOCATION_ . to examine the roles of _PROTEIN_ on plant growth and development arabidopsis transgenic lines were generated in which the _PROTEIN_ complementary dna was _PROTEIN_ under the control of the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus promoter _PROTEIN_ . their effective overexpression was monitored using reverse transcription and quantitative pcr analyses . surprisingly _PROTEIN_ plants did not display reduced growth as observed for the overexpression of other krps . to analyze the effects of _PROTEIN_ overexpression on dna ploidy distribution the dna content of cauline leaf _LOCATION_ in the wild type and independent transgenic _PROTEIN_ lines was measured by flow cytometry . in the wild type endoreduplication occurs in cauline leaves but it is not as high as in rosette leaves . in all _PROTEIN_ lines increases in the and populations was observed correlated with a _PROTEIN_ in the proportion of _LOCATION_ with dna content illustrating an activation of the endoreduplication cycle . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is involved in the activation of endoreduplication . to confirm this result we asked whether the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ was associated with higher dna content . flow cytometry allowed us to monitor dna content and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ simultaneously . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was detected almost exclusively in endoreduplicated _LOCATION_ with an and higher dna content and in some _LOCATION_ with a dna content which could correspond to a first round of endoreduplication . this observation supports the hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ stimulates endoreduplication . to provide further evidence for a role of _PROTEIN_ as a positive regulator of endoreduplication we asked whether the loss of _PROTEIN_ may result in a reduction of endoreduplication . a search in arabidopsis transfer dna insertion mutant collections was performed . an arabidopsis insertion line was obtained from the salk collection of t dna insertion lines . the genotype of this _PROTEIN_ mutant which contains an insertion in the first exon was confirmed by pcr . qrt pcr analysis was used to assess the effect of the t dna mutation on the _PROTEIN_ transcript in homozygous mutant plants . this analysis showed that the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene in the _PROTEIN_ mutant corresponds to of that in the wild type columbia plants indicating that the mutation is not a full knockout but severely affects the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene . we did not observe any difference in the dna content of _LOCATION_ isolated from mature leaves . we reasoned that krps may have partially redundant functions and that _PROTEIN_ analysis may help us to identify in which particular cellular context _PROTEIN_ could have a prominent role in the regulation of endoreduplication . a survey of publicly available gene _PROTEIN_ data revealed that _PROTEIN_ is highly _PROTEIN_ in dark grown seedlings . to confirm this we compared _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in dark and light grown seedlings . we observed an fold induction of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in dark versus light conditions . accordingly in etiolated seedlings we observed that the level of endoreduplication correlated with _METHOD_ labeling in the _PROTEIN_ ntf _METHOD_ lines . hypocotyl growth in etiolated seedlings is mediated only by cell elongation and is associated with increased endoreduplication . together with the increased _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the dark this suggests that _PROTEIN_ could regulate endoreduplication during etiolation . to test this the dna content of _LOCATION_ isolated from etiolated d old plantlets of the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ mutant was measured by flow cytometry . etiolated _PROTEIN_ mutants displayed a moderate but reproducible _PROTEIN_ in the population providing evidence for an inhibition of the endoreduplication cycle in the mutant context . this result is consistent with the opposite effect of _PROTEIN_ overexpression observed in the same condition . this reduction of the proportion of _LOCATION_ was reversed by the introduction of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct in the mutant background demonstrating that reintroduction of the _PROTEIN_ cdna complements the mutant phenotype . we also checked the level of endoreduplication in _PROTEIN_ mutants grown under the light condition and no difference was observed compared with the wild type . because there is strong evidence that the level of ploidy has some impact on cell size determination cortical cell sizes of etiolated hypocotyls were compared between the wild type _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ mutant . as shown in figure cell size distribution indicated that globally cortical cells are longer in the hypocotyls of _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type whereas these cells are shorter in _PROTEIN_ mutants . this observation is consistent with differences in the ploidy levels obtained for each genotype . we also measured the total hypocotyl length of the wild type _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ mutant and no significant differences were observed indicating either that the differences in cell size are not important enough to affect the global organ size or that cell number is altered in these plants . taken together our results point to a role of _PROTEIN_ as a positive regulator of endoreduplication raising the question of the molecular _METHOD_ underlying this function . the primary role of krps is to inhibit cdk/cyclin complexes . therefore we asked whether _PROTEIN_ could promote endoreduplication via cdk/cyclin inactivation . as stated above krps preferentially bind d type cyclins . the synthesis of d type cyclins is initiated during _PROTEIN_ and drives the _PROTEIN_ phase transition . constitutive overexpression of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis plants leads to dramatic changes in plant morphology . _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants also show an increase in the proportion of cells with a dna content and _PROTEIN_ have been identified as negative regulators of endoreduplication . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ could inhibit activity and rescue the _PROTEIN_ overexpression phenotype we transformed _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct . the presence of the _PROTEIN_ transgene was monitored via qrt pcr analyses and _METHOD_ visualization . interestingly the phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ cooverexpression plants was similar to that of the wild type suggesting that these two proteins have antagonistic activities in planta . furthermore flow cytometry analysis revealed that _PROTEIN_ plants displayed wild type levels of endoreduplication in cauline leaves demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ overexpression overcomes the effect of _PROTEIN_ overexpression . hence _PROTEIN_ could promote endoreduplication by inhibiting _PROTEIN_ . however other _METHOD_ may also contribute to the _PROTEIN_ dependent activation of endoreduplication . for example in mammals a kip protein regulates differentiation by directly modulating gene _PROTEIN_ . because _PROTEIN_ has a punctate distribution in _LOCATION_ we investigated its ability to bind chromatin . to examine the subnuclear distribution of _PROTEIN_ we performed immunodetection experiments using an antibody raised against _METHOD_ and with an antibody which is a cytological mark for visible heterochromatin . immunostaining showed that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was located inside and outside chromocenters as reported previously for other krps . these observations prove that _PROTEIN_ localizes into euchromatic and heterochromatic regions suggesting that it could play a role in chromatin structure . to identify _PROTEIN_ binding sites we performed _PROTEIN_ seq on chromatin isolated from arabidopsis plantlets . the macs _PROTEIN_ algorithm was used to determine which loci are significantly enriched for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the macs algorithm is designed to detect transcription _PROTEIN_ binding events which typically produce short peaks with strong signal intensity . we identified around _PROTEIN_ bound genomic loci . first we analyzed the _PROTEIN_ peak distance to the transcriptional start site _PROTEIN_ we showed that _PROTEIN_ binding was not centered on the _PROTEIN_ and that the gaussian curve displays its maximum at bp downstream of the _PROTEIN_ . to annotate the _PROTEIN_ binding sites we used the genomic position annotation tool . of these loci were identified as pseudogenes as trna as transposable elements and as protein coding genes . these data were consistent with the dual subnuclear localization of _PROTEIN_ in chromocenters which are known to be full of transposable elements and in euchromatin . to analyze the gene ontology of the protein coding _PROTEIN_ target genes we used an integrated web based go analysis toolkit agrigo and generated a hierarchical tree graph of overrepresented go _METHOD_ in the biological process category showing a significant enrichment in plant type cell wall organization . this result suggests a role of _PROTEIN_ in the regulation of genes involved in plant cell wall organization and in heterochromatin structure raising the question of the _METHOD_ allowing its recruitment on chromatin . to identify chromatin related proteins that may facilitate _PROTEIN_ binding on chromatin we searched for interacting partners . a subunit of the putative swi/snf chromatin remodeling complex was previously characterized by tandem affinity purification of tagged proteins experiment as a _PROTEIN_ partner . to confirm that _PROTEIN_ proteins can interact with we used bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation in protoplasts isolated from by cell suspensions . by cell protoplasts were transformed with constructs encoding a fusion between _PROTEIN_ and the n terminal region of yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and between the whole amino acid sequence and the c terminal region of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . as shown in supplemental figure _METHOD_ _METHOD_ could be detected in the _LOCATION_ of protoplasts cotransformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ can interact with in plant cells . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ could bind chromatin and control transcription through the action of chromatin remodeling complexes . to determine if a correlation exists between chromatin bound _PROTEIN_ and a transcriptional activation or repression we first selected a set of _PROTEIN_ binding genes _PROTEIN_ a gene involved in endoreduplication regulation _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which are involved in cell wall structure and a transposable element . all of these target genes were confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation _PROTEIN_ pcr . then the _PROTEIN_ levels of these genes were quantified by qrt pcr showing a correlation between the presence of _PROTEIN_ and an activation of the transcription . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ could act directly to promote gene transcription unraveling a new mechanism by which _PROTEIN_ may control endoreduplication or cell differentiation . however of _PROTEIN_ binding sites do not correspond to euchromatin but to heterochromatin regions which raises the question of the role of _PROTEIN_ at these sites . previous work showed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ related _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ two redundant genes encoding histone methyltransferases play a critical role in _PROTEIN_ heterochromatin condensation and gene silencing in arabidopsis . moreover these proteins can act to suppress dna rereplication in heterochromatic regions of the arabidopsis genome . because we found _PROTEIN_ to bind to heterochromatin we asked whether this association could also participate in the control of endoreduplication . to test this we transformed the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct . then we measured the dna content of the first cauline leaf _LOCATION_ in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant _PROTEIN_ and in five independent _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines by flow cytometry . we observed that the proportion of _LOCATION_ was increased when _PROTEIN_ was overexpressed in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant context compared with _PROTEIN_ alone . to confirm that the increase in endoreduplication could be correlated with a destabilization of the chromatin structure we performed cytological observation of leaf _LOCATION_ . as shown in figure overexpression of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant context dramatically _PROTEIN_ the heterochromatin compaction . twenty one percent of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ presented this specific chromatin phenotype comparatively of wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ showed this strong phenotype . altogether our results suggested that condensation of heterochromatin functions as a barrier to endoreduplication and that _PROTEIN_ can promote heterochromatin decondensation when the deposition of is inhibited .
