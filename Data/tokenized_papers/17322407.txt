mutations of arabidopsis thaliana irregular _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were previously shown to cause a collapsed xylem phenotype and _PROTEIN_ in xylose and cellulose in cell walls . in this study we characterized _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and performed chemical and structural analyses of _PROTEIN_ from _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ specifically in cells undergoing secondary wall _PROTEIN_ and their encoded proteins are targeted to the _LOCATION_ where gx is synthesized . nmr spectroscopy showed that the reducing end of arabidopsis gx contains the glycosyl sequence d xylp d xylp l rhap d galpa d xylp which was previously identified in birch and spruce gx . this indicates that the reducing end structure of gxs is evolutionarily conserved in woody and herbaceous plants . this sequence is more abundant in _PROTEIN_ gx than in the wild type whereas _PROTEIN_ and fragile _PROTEIN_ plants are nearly devoid of it . the number of gx chains increased and the gx chain length _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ plants . conversely the number of gx chains _PROTEIN_ and the chain length heterodispersity increased in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants . our results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is required for normal gx elongation and indicate roles for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the synthesis of the glycosyl sequence at the gx reducing end .
the interfascicular fibers of arabidopsis inflorescence _METHOD_ deposit a _METHOD_ amount of secondary walls and provide a model system for studying the _METHOD_ of secondary wall synthesis . during a search for xylan biosynthetic genes that are highly _PROTEIN_ in interfascicular fibers we found that two _PROTEIN_ genes _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ and _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ exhibited an organ _PROTEIN_ pattern similar to that of _PROTEIN_ based on _PROTEIN_ data from the atgenexpress project and rt pcr analysis . further _PROTEIN_ analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ in developing interfascicular fibers but not in parenchymatous pith cells . mutation of the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ gene causes a strong dwarf phenotype thus it is important to know whether these genes function specifically in secondary wall synthesis by examining when and where they are _PROTEIN_ . to investigate their _PROTEIN_ patterns we fused the wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes with the _PROTEIN_ reporter gene and transformed the constructs into wild type arabidopsis plants . analysis of gus activity in transgenic plants revealed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were specifically _PROTEIN_ in cells undergoing secondary wall _PROTEIN_ including interfascicular fibers and primary and secondary xylem in _METHOD_ and developing secondary xylem in roots . these _PROTEIN_ patterns were confirmed by in situ mrna hybridization . our results demonstrate that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is specifically associated with secondary wall _PROTEIN_ in fibers and vessels . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations result in a reduction in both xylose and cellulose in cell walls . thus we investigated whether the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins are located in the _LOCATION_ where gx is synthesized or at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ where cellulose is synthesized . transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ exhibited punctate _METHOD_ signals in the cytoplasm of root epidermal cells indicating that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are located in subcellular organelles . cotransfection of yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ with cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged _LOCATION_ localized _PROTEIN_ in carrot protoplasts revealed their colocalization suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are located in the _LOCATION_ . sequence analysis using the program predicted that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are type ii _LOCATION_ proteins with a single transmembrane helix at the n terminus . these results are consistent with a role of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in gx biosynthesis which is known to occur in the _LOCATION_ . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations were shown to result in plants with abnormal vessel morphology . to extend these findings we examined the _PROTEIN_ of secondary walls in two independent t dna insertion lines for the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ genes . we found that the wall _PROTEIN_ of interfascicular fibers and vessels in the _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants was _PROTEIN_ by compared with the wild type which is most likely the cause of their reduced stem strength . in addition the wall _PROTEIN_ of xylary fibers and vessels in the secondary xylem of roots was also reduced . the reduced secondary wall _PROTEIN_ phenotype caused by mutations of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes is consistent with their _PROTEIN_ patterns . the defects in secondary wall _PROTEIN_ stem strength and plant growth in both mutants were rescued by _PROTEIN_ of their corresponding wild type genes confirming that these phenotypes were caused directly by mutations of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes . to investigate whether the _PROTEIN_ mutation affects gx deposition in secondary walls we performed immunolocalization of gx using monoclonal antibodies and . has been reported to bind to o methylglucuronoxylan but not to arabinoxylan and _PROTEIN_ whereas interacts with both o methylglucuronoxylan and arabinoxylan . only labeling is shown because similar results were observed with the antibody . immunolabeling of stem and root sections revealed strong _METHOD_ signals in the walls of interfascicular fibers and xylem cells in wild type arabidopsis but only weak signals were detected in the corresponding tissues of _PROTEIN_ plants . transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that the density of immunogold labeling was reduced drastically in _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type . by contrast the _METHOD_ labeling of walls in _PROTEIN_ plants remained strong . however the overall intensity was reduced most likely as a result of the reduced wall _PROTEIN_ . the density of the immunogold labeling of walls in _PROTEIN_ plants and wild type plants was comparable . our data suggest that even though both the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations caused a nearly reduction in secondary wall _PROTEIN_ these mutations have different effects on gx deposition in arabidopsis secondary walls . previous studies have shown that the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations lead to a reduction in cell wall xylose which has led to the suggestion that gx synthesis is affected in these mutants . to confirm and extend this notion we isolated and characterized gxs from the cell walls of inflorescence _METHOD_ of wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants . we also isolated walls from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ so that we could compare the affects on gx structure of each of the three mutations . we found that most of the xylose rich polysaccharides are solubilized by treating the walls with and n koh . at least of this material remained soluble after neutralization . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations led to and reductions respectively in the xylose content of these extracts . we established that these changes are attributable to a _PROTEIN_ in gx content by showing similar reductions in the amounts of xylo oligosaccharides that are generated by treating the koh extracts with endoxylanase . nmr analysis indicated that the high molecular weight material remaining after endoxylanase treatment contained little if any gx and that xyloglucan and pectin are the predominant polysaccharide components of this fraction . together these results indicate that the recovered xylo oligosaccharides represent the majority of the koh solubilized gx . glycosyl residue compositions of the and n koh soluble materials from wild type and mutant arabidopsis _METHOD_ amounts of wild type and mutant arabidopsis gxs to further investigate changes in gx structure and establish gx chemotypes for each mutant we used size exclusion chromatography _PROTEIN_ to separate the neutral and acidic xylo oligosaccharides generated by endoxylanase treatment of the n koh soluble material from wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants . all six fractions were analyzed by _PROTEIN_ assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the maldi tof spectra of the fractions contained ions indicating the presence of the expected products _PROTEIN_ in the neutral fractions and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the acidic fractions . the nmr spectra of the acidic fractions showed that in the wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the glca meglca ratios were and respectively . a similar _PROTEIN_ in the proportion of glca was observed in _PROTEIN_ gx suggesting that all three mutations lead to an alteration in gx structure . nmr assignments of the acidic xylo oligosaccharides generated by endoxylanase treatment of the and n koh soluble materials the nmr spectrum of the _PROTEIN_ acidic xylo oligosaccharides contained several unexpected signals that were much stronger than in the wild type spectrum and that were nearly absent in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ spectra . to investigate the origin of these signals we separated the acidic oligosaccharides by reverse phase hplc . maldi tof _METHOD_ of one of the fractions was enriched in an ion at m/z consistent with the presence of an oligoglycosyl alditol . such alditols are generated when the residue at the reducing end of the polysaccharide reacts with which is added to the alkaline extraction medium to avoid degradation by base catalyzed peeling reactions . to improve the separation of the xylo oligosaccharides by reverse phase hplc the reducing oligosaccharides were converted to their aminobenzamide derivatives . this resulted in the separation of the oligosaccharide alditol which binds weakly to the column from the aminobenzamide derivatives which bind strongly . the nmr spectrum of the purified oligoglycosyl alditol was dominated by the unexpected signals initially detected in the spectrum of the acidic xylo oligosaccharide fraction from _PROTEIN_ . these signals were assigned to protons of galpa rhap and xylp residues on the basis of their scalar coupling patterns and chemical shifts in the gcosy and tocsy spectra . the linkages between each glycosyl residue were deduced from the interglycosidic scalar couplings observed in the high resolution gcosy spectrum and from the interglycosidic dipolar couplings observed in noesy and roesy spectra . together the nmr and maldi tof _METHOD_ analyses provide sufficient evidence to unambiguously assign the linkage and sequence of residues in the oligoglycosyl alditol as d xylp d xylp l rhap d galpa d xylitol . previous studies have shown that d xylp d xylp l rhap d galpa d xyl is present at the reducing end of birch and spruce gxs . the reducing xylose is converted to xylitol when the gx is solubilized with koh containing . this led us to believe that glycosyl sequence is present at the reducing end of arabidopsis gx and that the accumulation of this glycosyl sequence is affected in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants . nmr assignments of glycosyl sequence to confirm that glycosyl sequence is indeed present at the reducing end of arabidopsis gx we solubilized gxs from _PROTEIN_ cell walls in the absence and presence of . the nmr spectra of both gxs contained resonances of the internal galpa rhap and xylp residues of glycosyl sequence . signals for h of the and _METHOD_ of the reducing xylose were present only in the gx extracted in the absence of . the presence of this reducing sugar resulted in discernible chemical shift and anomerization effects on several of the resonances of the galpa rhap and linked xylp residues . in particular h of the d galpa was split into two fully resolved signals whose intensities are comparable to those of the h signals of the and _METHOD_ of the reducing xylose . this analysis verified that the linked xylp rhap and galpa residues are in close proximity to the xylose at the reducing end of the gx . we conclude that glycosyl sequence is located at the reducing ends of gxs synthesized by arabidopsis and that the abundance of this sequence is altered in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ gxs . our data have clearly shown that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations lead to a discernible reduction in the amounts of cell wall gx and to alterations in gx structure . we then decided to determine whether the size distribution of the gx was also affected by these mutations . toward this goal we analyzed the and n koh soluble materials by _PROTEIN_ . these _PROTEIN_ profiles correspond to the sum of the profiles of all of the components present in the extract . selectively removing one component and then subtracting the resulting _PROTEIN_ profile from the total allows a profile corresponding to that of the component that was removed to be obtained . thus we treated the alkali extracts with a homogenous endoxylanase and analyzed the products by _PROTEIN_ . the profile of the endoxylanase treated material was then subtracted from the untreated profile . the resulting profile represents the material that is susceptible to endoxylanase and thus corresponds to the size distribution of the gx . we found an increase in the heterodispersity of the gxs isolated from _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants . moreover some of the gxs from these plants have a higher molecular weight than do wild type gx . by contrast the _PROTEIN_ mutation resulted in a _PROTEIN_ in the molecular weight of the gx . this _PROTEIN_ in molecular weight may account for the _PROTEIN_ that of the _PROTEIN_ gx was solubilized by n koh whereas the same treatment solubilized only of the gx in wild type plants . our data had provided evidence that wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants synthesize gxs with different size distributions . we initially assumed that all gx molecules solubilized by alkali containing would contain glycosyl sequence at their reducing ends . an estimate of the average degree of polymerization of these gxs could then be obtained by integrating selected resonances of reducing oligosaccharides and glycosyl sequence in the nmr spectra of the endoxylanase generated xylo oligosaccharides . however during this analysis we discovered that some of these oligomers had xylp rather than galpa attached to xylitol . our data suggest that at least of the gxs from _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants had d xylp d xylp at their reducing ends . by contrast of the gxs from _PROTEIN_ plants and of wild type gxs contain glycosyl sequence at their reducing ends . thus the increased size heterogeneity of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ gxs is correlated with a _PROTEIN_ in the proportion of gx molecules that have glycosyl sequence at their reducing ends . furthermore the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations result in a _PROTEIN_ in the number of gx molecules synthesized whereas the primary effect of the _PROTEIN_ mutation is a _PROTEIN_ in the gx molecular weight . nmr assignments of the xylp residues linked to xylitol in oligoglycosyl xylitols containing xyl glca or o methyl glca selected properties of wild type and
