target of rapamycin _PROTEIN_ is a major nutrition and energy sensor that regulates growth and life span in yeast and animals . in plants growth and life span are intertwined not only with nutrient acquisition from the soil and nutrition generation via photosynthesis but also with their unique modes of development and differentiation . how _PROTEIN_ functions in these processes has not yet been determined . to gain further insights rapamycin sensitive transgenic arabidopsis thaliana lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ yeast _PROTEIN_ binding were developed . inhibition of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ plants by rapamycin resulted in slower overall root leaf and shoot growth and development leading to poor nutrient uptake and light energy utilization . experimental limitation of nutrient availability and light energy supply in wild type arabidopsis produced phenotypes observed with _PROTEIN_ knockdown plants indicating a link between _PROTEIN_ signaling and nutrition/light energy status . genetic and physiological studies together with rna sequencing and metabolite analysis of _PROTEIN_ suppressed lines revealed that _PROTEIN_ regulates development and life span in arabidopsis by restructuring cell growth _PROTEIN_ and nitrogen metabolism gene _PROTEIN_ and rrna and protein synthesis . gain and loss of function ribosomal protein _PROTEIN_ mutants additionally show that _PROTEIN_ function involves _PROTEIN_ mediated nutrition and light dependent growth and life span in arabidopsis .
we generated independent transgenic arabidopsis lines _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ the yeast _PROTEIN_ gene under the control of a constitutive promoter . none of these lines showed any detectable or visible developmental or growth defects . pcr identification of lines confirmed the presence of _PROTEIN_ in all the lines except line . from these independent lines _PROTEIN_ lines were selected for rapamycin sensitivity and segregation analysis in the generation . compared with wild type plants all independent _PROTEIN_ lines were responsive to rapamycin treatment causing phenotypes including slower plant growth with shorter shoots and roots . copy number for _PROTEIN_ in these lines was verified by dna gel blots the _PROTEIN_ line contained a single copy _PROTEIN_ two copies _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ three copies each and the rest of the transformed lines had multiple copies . we selected five independent generation lines _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ and confirmed the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ transcript and corresponding protein in all of them . then seedling growth of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines was examined in the same plate at incremental rapamycin concentrations to in the medium using murashige and skoog _METHOD_ containing _METHOD_ as controls . on _METHOD_ _METHOD_ medium the seedling growth of these four _PROTEIN_ lines was similar to wild type plants grown on _METHOD_ medium confirming that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ does not alter plant growth or development . the growth of wild type seedlings was no different at or rapamycin but clear phenotypes affecting primary root growth _PROTEIN_ root initiation cotyledon growth rosette leaf initiation and expansion and shoot growth were observed in the four independent transgenic _PROTEIN_ lines . the severity of these phenotypes increased with increasing concentrations of rapamycin with even a dose of rapamycin being sufficient to observe effects on seedling growth in all the four _PROTEIN_ lines . these results clearly indicate that arabidopsis seedling growth and the observed root and shoot phenotypes are dependent on both the _PROTEIN_ transgene _PROTEIN_ and rapamycin consistent with previous observations . we would like to note here that compared with the findings with transgenic arabidopsis lines the wild type seedling growth was normal even at the highest concentration of rapamycin tested . we used rapamycin at concentration in the remainder of the experiments because this level allowed _PROTEIN_ lines to complete their life cycle in spite of its effect on growth and the effects of _PROTEIN_ signaling at different stages of postembryonic development could be assessed . to address subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ we generated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ transgenic arabidopsis lines out of which selected lines were analyzed by pcr to confirm the presence of the transgene with _METHOD_ fusion . all the selected lines except line were positive . we also confirmed rapamycin sensitivity in lines to suggesting that c terminal fusion of _METHOD_ did not significantly affect the rapamycin sensitivity of in the _PROTEIN_ complex . the _PROTEIN_ protein was localized to two compartments the _LOCATION_ and the cytoplasm which is similar to the subcellular localization pattern previously observed in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines . the colocalization of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ protein in the _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm may be an indication of a functional interaction between these proteins in the presence of rapamycin similar to that shown in yeast and animal _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ kinase function involves phosphorylation of its downstream target proteins such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . phosphorylation of at thr residue has been used to monitor _PROTEIN_ activity in mammals . since the human and arabidopsis homologs share a similar consensus phosphorylation motif for _PROTEIN_ it is possible to detect the phosphorylation status of human as substrate for arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ kinase using an hs specific antibody . therefore we explored this possibility in _PROTEIN_ lines with the hs antibody by creating double transgenics _PROTEIN_ both _PROTEIN_ and hs transgenes . we introduced the human construct hs in the single copy _PROTEIN_ homozygous _PROTEIN_ line . generation seeds were screened on _METHOD_ medium containing both basta and kanamycin . nine independent lines containing both hs and _PROTEIN_ were identified by pcr and rt pcr . the line that showed the highest _PROTEIN_ level of was used to determine at _PROTEIN_ kinase activity . the elisa data showed that in c plants of proteins were phosphorylated at thr by _PROTEIN_ kinase protein in the control whereas in the presence of rapamycin protein phosphorylation was reduced to indicating that rapamycin significantly inhibited _PROTEIN_ kinase activity . a recent study also used hs specific antibody to monitor _PROTEIN_ activity in arabidopsis . _PROTEIN_ has been shown to promote anabolic activity and cell growth in yeast and animals . to explore the possible links between _PROTEIN_ and plant growth we selected _PROTEIN_ with a single _PROTEIN_ transgene copy and _PROTEIN_ with multiple copies for further study . in the presence of rapamycin both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ displayed a consistent reduction in growth and uniform rapamycin sensitive phenotypes . the wild type did not have any discernible phenotypes . the transgenic lines showed a significant reduction in seedling length and fresh weight compared with the wild type at d after germination . the slow growth was more pronounced by dag . also the growth of primary and _PROTEIN_ roots was significantly inhibited in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants . closer examination of the roots showed that the root hair growth was severely inhibited by rapamycin in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines compared with the wild type . since the root apical meristem size is defined by the proliferation of the transit amplifying cells the daughter cells of the stem cells we compared the ram region of _PROTEIN_ and the wild type . _PROTEIN_ ram showed a significant reduction in the tac zone resulting in a smaller ram . this is likely due to _PROTEIN_ cell division rate in the meristem region and in the tac zone . the smaller ram in _PROTEIN_ was associated with differentiation of the xylem tracheary elements closer to the ram region compared with the wild type . to investigate the effects of rapamycin treatment on cell elongation we focused on the hypocotyl region of seedlings which shows rapid cell elongation in the dark . upon rapamycin treatment both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ hypocotyls elongated to only half the length of wild type hypocotyls . elongation of cells from the mid region of the hypocotyl was reduced by in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type . we also examined cell size in epidermal palisade and spongy mesophyll cells of the leaves treated with rapamycin . significantly smaller cells were observed in rapamycin treated _PROTEIN_ line but not the wild type . together these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ activity is required for normal cell elongation and expansion in arabidopsis . changes in cellular metabolism particularly the accumulation of amino acids in response to suppression of _PROTEIN_ signaling have been previously observed in yeast animals and arabidopsis . to ascertain which metabolic changes accompany the growth pattern of _PROTEIN_ suppression lines we analyzed metabolite profiles in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines and in the wild type in the presence or absence of rapamycin . both the transgenic lines showed robust rapamycin dependent responses but the wild type exhibited few changes . quite remarkably rapamycin significantly affected primary metabolism with increases in the glycolytic and tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates and a large number of amino acids there were also notable increases in some components of the secondary metabolism such as the polyamine pathway antioxidative pathway and phenylpropanoid pathway in the two _PROTEIN_ lines analyzed . there was an increase in methanol extractable d galacturonate . as noted above _PROTEIN_ inhibition results in a reduction of hypocotyl elongation and smaller cells in the leaves . as cell expansion and tissue growth require incorporation of d galacturonate into polymeric form in cell wall pectin we attribute the increase in d galacturonate to tempered cell wall assembly upon _PROTEIN_ inhibition . deoxyoctulosonate another substrate for pectin synthesis had also increased . interestingly there was a reduction in the myo inositol level . myo inositol is a precursor of d _PROTEIN_ that in turn can be metabolized to d galacturonate . the tca cycle intermediates citrate fumarate malate and succinate registered significant increases . since photosynthesis is diminished in _PROTEIN_ inhibited lines the tca intermediates required for cellular respiration and _PROTEIN_ of growth likely arise from reorganized metabolism . since the nitrogen supply in the growth medium was the same _PROTEIN_ of rapamycin inclusion reduced _PROTEIN_ fixation would be expected to distort _PROTEIN_ nitrogen balance in the cells . the interrelationship in _PROTEIN_ nitrogen metabolism is complex . like the increase in organic acids prominent increases in the amino acids and polyamines were apparent in rapamycin treated _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines . the increased level of several amino acids is attributed to protein degradation as a source for energy metabolism . the reduction in dipeptides is presumably an _PROTEIN_ measure of _PROTEIN_ inhibited cells to make amino acids to support respiration and limited growth . the _PROTEIN_ in arg levels parallels a _PROTEIN_ in n acetylglutamate n acetylornithine orn and citrulline the precursors of arg biosynthesis . this _PROTEIN_ in arg levels and a concomitant increase in dimethylarginine under rapamycin treatment is an indication of methylation of proteinaceous arg . arg dimethylation acts as an antiaging modification in caenorhabditis elegans and increased its life span . _PROTEIN_ levels of the polyamine precursors arg and orn were noted alongside increased levels of the biogenic amines agmatine and putrescine and the product of their catabolism methylthioadenosine . these results suggest that a perceived signal generated by _PROTEIN_ suppression redirects _PROTEIN_ flow and metabolic shift to other pathways to support the growth of rapamycin treated _PROTEIN_ plants . other metabolic alterations arising from rapamycin treatment included some secondary metabolites . the phenylpropanoid pathway generates among precursors for other products substrates for flavonoids that exist in relatively simple _METHOD_ and more complex _METHOD_ that are recalcitrant to methanol extraction . this pathway generates hydroxycinnamic acid derived monolignols that when polymerized appropriately become the lignin component of the cell wall . rapamycin suppression of _PROTEIN_ activity led to increases in methanol extractable hca and monolignols supporting the inference noted above with reference to tempered cell wall assembly . tyramine derived from l tyr can condense with hydroxycinnamoyl coa esters to form amides that can then be incorporated in cell walls . the levels of tyramine were also lower when _PROTEIN_ was inhibited even though the hca content was elevated . also members of anti reactive oxygen species including oxoproline and both oxidized and reduced _METHOD_ of glutathione all increased in rapamycin treated _PROTEIN_ plants . the ratio of gsh/gssg is significantly reduced in _PROTEIN_ lines compared with the wild type control indicative of active ros quenching . in c. elegans genetic or rapamycin inhibition of _PROTEIN_ activates a stress protective response that includes glutathione s transferase and genes involved in glutathione among others . this while reducing growth rate enhances life span of the worm similar to that observed in _PROTEIN_ plants treated with rapamycin . purine and pyrimidine metabolism and also the lipid metabolism were notably the least affected by rapamycin mediated _PROTEIN_ signaling suppression . an active protein metabolism is apparent from an increase in dimethylarginine which is posttranslationally formed in proteins . these changes in metabolic profiles of rapamycin treated _PROTEIN_ plants compared with the wild type indicate redirection of specific _PROTEIN_ and nitrogen metabolites involving both primary and secondary metabolism suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is associated with coordination of several primary and secondary metabolic activities during growth and development of arabidopsis . we performed global rna sequencing analysis in _PROTEIN_ to obtain a perspective of gene _PROTEIN_ under conditions of _PROTEIN_ inhibition . comparative transcriptomes of rapamycin treated _PROTEIN_ line and the wild type identified a large number of differentially _PROTEIN_ genes . among these the most prominent downregulated genes under _PROTEIN_ inhibition in rapamycin treated _PROTEIN_ line were associated with major anabolic pathways including cell wall biogenesis photosynthesis and inorganic nutrient transporters . by contrast a large number of genes associated with catabolic pathways involving _PROTEIN_ and proteins were upregulated in rapamycin treated _PROTEIN_ plants . in the category of cell wall biogenesis genes downregulated in rapamycin treated _PROTEIN_ included structural proteins extensins expansins pro rich proteins and arabinogalactan and hyp rich glycoproteins . extensins are involved in cell wall architecture whereas expansins function to enable plant cell expansion . since cell wall development governs cell size shape and function together with the _PROTEIN_ that genes that enable restructuring of cell wall during growth were affected in rapamycin treated _PROTEIN_ plants we quantified these genes and confirmed the transcriptome data using real time pcr . all of the extensin genes seven of the nine expansin genes and pro and glyco rich cell wall protein genes tested were significantly downregulated in rapamycin treated _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type . also galactinol synthase involved in the synthesis of raffinose family of oligosaccharides was significantly downregulated . this is consistent with a _PROTEIN_ level of galactinol and raffinose in _PROTEIN_ knockdown plants . biosynthesis of rfos is catalyzed via the formation of galactinol from myo inositol and udp gal by galactinol synthase . sequential transfer of gal units from galactinol to suc leads to the formation of raffinose and higher order rfos . both galactinol and raffinose are proposed to protect plant cells from oxidative damage by scavenging hydroxyl radicals when _PROTEIN_ by strong oxidizing agents such as methyl viologen or _PROTEIN_ stress . the low level of rfos in rapamycin treated plants is consistent with a lowered oxidative _PROTEIN_ in these plants . taken together these transcriptome data are consistent with and complement the _PROTEIN_ metabolite data and suggest that _PROTEIN_ controls cell expansion and elongation likely via regulating the _PROTEIN_ of the cell wall structural proteins . inorganic nutrition transporters that are essential for anabolic processes in plants were also downregulated in rapamycin treated _PROTEIN_ . this is reflected by the poor growth of rapamycin treated _PROTEIN_ plants even when grown under nonlimiting supply of inorganic nutrients in the medium . defensin genes that are part of the stress response pathway in arabidopsis are upregulated . in parallel with these observations is downregulation of genes encoding ribulose bis phosphate _PROTEIN_ small subunit and ndp kinase in rapamycin treated _PROTEIN_ plants which are important for _PROTEIN_ fixation and the light signaling pathway respectively in the chloroplast . thus downregulation of photosynthesis a major anabolic process in plants can contribute to growth defects in rapamycin treated _PROTEIN_ plants . similarly defects in the development of root hairs and elongation of _PROTEIN_ and primary roots in rapamycin treated _PROTEIN_ plants are consistent with the transcriptome data showing differential _PROTEIN_ of root related genes in these plants . thirty three of these were found to be significantly downregulated including morphogenesis of root _PROTEIN_ which affects root hair development . metabolite data clearly indicated increased polyamine biosynthesis in rapamycin treated _PROTEIN_ plants . a limiting reaction in this pathway is catalyzed by s adenosylmethionine decarboxylase . s adenosylmethionine decarboxylase was one of the upregulated genes featured in rapamycin treated _PROTEIN_ plants whose _PROTEIN_ was also quantified and verified . thus the transcriptome and metabolite data are congruous and support the finding that inhibition of _PROTEIN_ activity affects metabolic processes linked to important plant growth processes . the above described data bring to the fore the nutrition relatedness of the plant _PROTEIN_ pathway and the question arose whether similar to the role of _PROTEIN_ as a nutrition sensor in yeast and animals _PROTEIN_ regulation of arabidopsis development and metabolism are influenced by nutrition . therefore wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedling growth was followed on different concentrations of _METHOD_ medium . wild type plants grown on nutrient poor medium _METHOD_ resembled the _PROTEIN_ plant grown on fold richer medium _METHOD_ but containing rapamycin indicating both nutrient starvation and _PROTEIN_ inhibition by rapamycin produce similar phenotypes . a gradual reduction of fresh weight in wild type plants was observed on _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ concentration in the medium . in _METHOD_ rapamycin medium that provides a condition of nutrient starvation and _PROTEIN_ inhibition both wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants displayed similar growth rates . under these conditions increasing the nutrient supply up to _METHOD_ while _PROTEIN_ the rapamycin concentration permitted a ninefold growth increase in the wild type but not in _PROTEIN_ whose growth remained close to that observed in _METHOD_ rapamycin . these results indicated that _PROTEIN_ plants could not respond positively to increasing nutrition levels when _PROTEIN_ is inhibited . under hypernutritive conditions _METHOD_ which also represent higher osmotic potential growth of the wild type and _PROTEIN_ line _PROTEIN_ relative to _METHOD_ rapamycin . increasing the concentrations of nitrogen and _PROTEIN_ significantly increased the growth rates of wild type seedlings whereas the _PROTEIN_ seedlings with rapamycin remained insensitive to this stimulation . we note here that phosphorylation was reduced to when nutrition was limited and this is similar to the reduced level of phosphorylation when _PROTEIN_ is inhibited by rapamycin . thus nutrition starvation phenocopies the suppression of _PROTEIN_ kinase activity . together these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ signaling senses nutritional status and may thereby control cell growth and development . plants respond positively to photosynthetic growth when light intensity is increased from suboptimal levels . this was observed with wild type plants . by contrast rapamycin treated _PROTEIN_ line failed to respond to increasing light intensities resulting in a growth rate that was > fold lower than the wild type control . to test the effect of combined light and nutrition conditions on plant growth fresh weight ratio between wild type and rapamycin treated _PROTEIN_ plants under various light intensities and nutrient concentrations _METHOD_ was determined . the largest fresh weight ratio value indicating a significant difference between wild type and rapamycin treated _PROTEIN_ plants was observed at light intensity . this ratio peaked at _METHOD_ and was significantly lower under weak light and dark conditions . consistent with these observations upon light energy limitation _PROTEIN_ kinase activity was significantly suppressed similar to that observed in _PROTEIN_ plants treated with rapamycin . we next determined whether the reduction of growth and _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ suppression lines is associated with ros and nad h reduction . ros signals in the root hair of wild type plants treated with rapamycin were similar to the control plants however significant reduction of ros signals was observed in rapamycin treated _PROTEIN_ plants compared with the control as was also the case with nad h levels . interestingly the ratios of nadh/nad and nadph/nadp in _PROTEIN_ lines did not differ from the wild type in response to rapamycin treatment indicating that the homeostasis of nad h/nad is _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ lines but the relative levels of nad h were lower compared with the wild type . glutathione reductase uses nadph to reduce the oxidized form of glutathione to the reduced form . the reduction of nadph is highly consistent with the ratio of gsh/gssg significantly _PROTEIN_ in rapamycin treated _PROTEIN_ lines compared with the wild type control observed in metabolite profile . these results suggest a mechanistic link between light energy _PROTEIN_ ros/nad h and plant growth . it is estimated that cells dedicate of total transcriptional activity to the synthesis of rrnas and proteins for ribosome biogenesis making ribosome biogenesis a major nutrient and energy consuming process in growing cells . the _PROTEIN_ regulation of energy and nutrient availability is known to be mediated by alterations in protein and ribosome production . we therefore quantified total rna production of wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants with and without rapamycin . total rna was significantly reduced in rapamycin treated _PROTEIN_ plants as also observed under light limiting conditions nutrition starvation and _PROTEIN_ or nitrogen limitation . under nutrient limitation _METHOD_ or when kept in the dark no further reduction in total rna was found in rapamycin treated _PROTEIN_ plants . thus _PROTEIN_ requires both light and nutrition signals to regulate total rna _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . previously _PROTEIN_ modulation of rrna _PROTEIN_ has been shown . we quantified rrna content in _PROTEIN_ plants using a _METHOD_ reporter construct _METHOD_ _METHOD_ previously described . the _METHOD_ transcripts quantified by real time pcr essentially mirrored the trends observed for the total rna levels in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ with analogous treatments . in order to delineate effects of _PROTEIN_ suppression on growth of arabidopsis we examined the kinetics of phase change flowering time chlorophyll content cell death rate and the senescence associated gene _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ lines in _METHOD_ rapamycin medium at fluence . the _PROTEIN_ plants characteristically had smaller rosette leaves slower phase change delayed flowering and shorter roots compared with the wild type . by dag the wild type plants had senesced whereas the _PROTEIN_ rosettes were still green and their roots had lengthened indicating sustained growth and longer life span . rapamycin application to _PROTEIN_ plants even at an advanced growth stage effectively delayed their flowering time and further aging . the delayed senescence in rapamycin treated _PROTEIN_ plants prompted us to further examine aging in the first rosette leaf pair in arabidopsis using known assays and markers chlorophyll content cell death rate and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels . at dag total chlorophyll content in the leaves had only reduced by in _PROTEIN_ line in contrast with in the wild type . cell death was only in _PROTEIN_ compared with in the wild type . the flowering time of _PROTEIN_ plants was delayed by d compared with the wild type . senescence rate was also measured by quantifying _PROTEIN_ marker _PROTEIN_ in the first leaf pair of the rosette treated with rapamycin . it should be noted that only _PROTEIN_ was used because both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ had shown similar trends in this study . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the wild type was clearly higher and in comparison it was initiated d _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ line but continued to gradually increase to the wild type levels by day . rapamycin treatment of _PROTEIN_ consistently delayed the emergence of hypocotyl establishment of rosette leaves bolting opening of the first flower and whole plant senescence relative to that in the wild type . consequently _PROTEIN_ plants lived d longer than the wild type . a previous study suggested involvement of _PROTEIN_ in regulating growth processes in arabidopsis . we further pursued this observation and found that _PROTEIN_ mutant lines show growth phenotypes similar to rapamycin treated _PROTEIN_ plants . independent t dna knockout lines representing loss of function of two _PROTEIN_ homologs _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ had smaller leaves slower root growth rate delayed phase change delayed flowering and longer life span in comparison to the wild type . our attempts to construct double mutants of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were not successful due to lethality in the double homozygous seeds . interestingly all the generation plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ confirmed by pcr based genotyping had the same phenotype as the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ single mutants . this further confirmed that heterozygosity of the two _PROTEIN_ genes results in dosage effect or haploinsufficiency as also previously noted . because stronger developmental defects were observed in our studies with _PROTEIN_ compared with the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants were used for additional experiments . the smaller leaves of _PROTEIN_ mutants had fewer secondary veins and the epidermal pavement cells were two thirds the size of comparable cells in the wild type while the tac zone in _PROTEIN_ mutant roots was much smaller than the wild type similar to observations shown above in rapamycin treated _PROTEIN_ ram . complementation tests confirmed the respective mutant alleles of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes . furthermore growth rates of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutants in different nutrition conditions and two light intensities were examined . in normal to rich nutrition medium or high light conditions the growth rate of the mutant seedlings was slower than that of the wild type but slightly better than wild type controls under poor nutrition or low light conditions . the observations of slow growth of _PROTEIN_ single mutants and the lethality of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants are reminiscent of rapamycin treated _PROTEIN_ plants and the tor mutants respectively . thus both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are limiting _PROTEIN_ for normal plant growth . these findings prompted us to test if _PROTEIN_ functions as a downstream mediator of _PROTEIN_ signaling as seem to be the case in yeast and animals . we therefore tested genetic interactions between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was suppressed in the _PROTEIN_ mutant by crossing _PROTEIN_ line with generation homozygous lines of _PROTEIN_ carrying _PROTEIN_ . in both the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants carrying _PROTEIN_ rapamycin treatment did not significantly _PROTEIN_ the growth rate to the levels observed in the rapamycin treated _PROTEIN_ line . this indicated that _PROTEIN_ inhibition phenotype to manifest fully requires functional and homozygous copies of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . however the chlorophyll content cell death rate flowering time and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ level in the rapamycin treated _PROTEIN_ carrying _PROTEIN_ followed the trend observed in rapamycin treated _PROTEIN_ plants and _PROTEIN_ single mutants . the values were consistently intermediate between those observed in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines . rapamycin treatment produced significant increase in the life span of the _PROTEIN_ mutants but not to the same extent as seen in the rapamycin treated _PROTEIN_ line . these observations suggest that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are required for _PROTEIN_ suppression dependent increase in life span observed in _PROTEIN_ plants . since _PROTEIN_ inhibited plants and _PROTEIN_ mutants displayed delayed phase change and _PROTEIN_ flowering we used _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ overexpression lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ generated in this study to obtain additional insights into the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ connection . the _PROTEIN_ overexpression line _PROTEIN_ flowers and senesces earlier compared with the wild type . although the first five leaves of the _PROTEIN_ rosette retain a shape similar to the wild type the latter formed more rounded leaves with short petioles . _PROTEIN_ siliques ripened earlier than the wild type . both the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines showed the following phenotypes early flowering early onset of senescence in rosette leaves and siliques and shorter petioles and bent siliques . in this _PROTEIN_ these plants resemble the _PROTEIN_ kinase domain overexpression lines . the results of reduced life span in overexpressors of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ together with the finding that the _PROTEIN_ mutation mitigates early flowering and senescence phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ plants suggest that the _PROTEIN_ mediated life span phenotypes require _PROTEIN_ function . we also verified the ability of rapamycin to specifically inhibit _PROTEIN_ using the _PROTEIN_ line . generation _PROTEIN_ plants showed early senescence and short life span as observed in _PROTEIN_ in the absence of rapamycin but these phenotypes were suppressed in the presence of rapamycin . notably the _PROTEIN_ overexpression phenotypes were suppressed by rapamycin only in lines with the yeast _PROTEIN_ background further confirming that rapamycin specifically inhibits _PROTEIN_ activity . next we used _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines that have high _PROTEIN_ of the respective transgenes to determine the effect of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ on life span in arabidopsis . both in the soil and on _METHOD_ media the rosette leaves of all these transgenic lines showed an early onset of senescence with rapid _PROTEIN_ in chlorophyll content _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and faster cell death rate . thus _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ overexpression contribute to accelerated senescence and flowering time . these observations are consistent with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ detected in the wild type at or after dag but _PROTEIN_ as early as dag in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ overexpression lines . at dag _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ overexpression lines was and fold higher respectively relative to the wild type . collectively these results demonstrated that the high _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels confer faster growth cycle and _PROTEIN_ life span in arabidopsis . we hypothesized that if _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ products have overlapping functions they should colocalize to same cellular location . therefore subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was determined by transient _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion constructs in onion epidermal cells . the _METHOD_ signal of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was found localized both in the _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm which is similar to previously observed localization of _PROTEIN_ . in addition to their colocalization we also determined that they share overlapping _PROTEIN_ patterns . both gus _PROTEIN_ and gus were found to be ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ in the seedling and inflorescence tissues and closely resembled the _PROTEIN_ pattern observed with _PROTEIN_ gus . these overlapping _PROTEIN_ and subcellular localization patterns for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ along with similar phenotypes in their loss and gain of function lines support our contention that these genes perform coordinated functions in the _PROTEIN_ signaling pathway in arabidopsis . protein synthesis is integral to active growth of _METHOD_ . we surmised that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ dependent pathways in arabidopsis would also be associated with active protein synthesis . changes in the rate of protein synthesis was followed by quantifying gus activity using methylumbelliferyl beta d _PROTEIN_ fluorometric enzymatic assays in the leaves of the wild type and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transgenic arabidopsis lines carrying a single copy of the gus construct . the gus activity in the leaves of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ overexpression lines was four and two times respectively that of the wild type leaves and a significant reduction was seen in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ leaves . in the presence of rapamycin gus activity was reduced by in _PROTEIN_ leaves compared with the wild type . thus we inferred from this reporter study that protein synthesis was significantly upregulated in lines overexpressing _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ and downregulated in _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ suppressors . taken together these data show that the role of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in growth rate and life span in arabidopsis are linked with rrna total rna production and protein synthesis .
in this study the wild type arabidopsis columbia ecotype was used . arabidopsis seedlings and plants were grown in growth chambers with and h light/dark cycle settings unless indicated otherwise . transgenic plants were generated by the floral dipping method . arabidopsis growth transformation and screening of primary transformants were performed according to the published protocols . the mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in columbia background were obtained from the _PROTEIN_ . detailed information describing mutant lines is listed in supplemental table online . the knockout lines were identified and confirmed by pcr using primers designed using the t dna primer design website http . the details of these primers are listed in supplemental table online . to measure the rate of plant growth sterilized seeds were planted on the nutrient solidified agar plates . plates were sealed with parafilm and held vertically in the growth chamber under the indicated light and temperature conditions . the seedling samples were harvested and the fresh weight was examined dag . for rapamycin treatments exposure of _PROTEIN_ plants to different concentrations of rapamycin showed that rapamycin was the optimal concentration to inhibit _PROTEIN_ as also documented in the previous study . in nutrition limitation or light limitation conditions the wild type control and _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants or _PROTEIN_ mutants were germinated on the same plate containing rapamycin or the same nitrogen/carbon concentration unless indicated otherwise . rapamycin was dissolved in _METHOD_ . it was noted that _METHOD_ plates containing _METHOD_ had no effects on the growth of wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants compared with _METHOD_ plates lacking _METHOD_ . therefore _METHOD_ plates are referred as _METHOD_ plates in all the rapamycin treatment assays . each fresh weight data point represents the average of three independent experiments . the full length coding sequence of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was amplified by rt pcr using the advantage polymerase mix kit following the manufacturer s instructions . rt pcr primer pairs for amplification of the full length genes from arabidopsis were designed based on the cdna sequence . these primers introduced a noti site at the end of the respective forward primer and an xmali site in the end of reverse primer . the pcr products with the noti site and xmali site were cloned into the ta cloning vector _PROTEIN_ topo . the recombinant clones were verified by dna sequencing and cloned into to generate the gateway system based entry vector . similarly the coding sequence of full length yeast _PROTEIN_ containing noti xmai restriction sites was pcr amplified from yeast genomic dna and cloned into the noti xmai sites of lr reaction gateway entry vector to generate gateway entry vector constructs . the gateway system was employed for creating different overexpression constructs which were developed by transferring target genes from into the appropriate pearleygate vectors _METHOD_ through lr recombination reactions in escherichia coli to generate _PROTEIN_ oe _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ oe _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the lines of _PROTEIN_ oe _PROTEIN_ were described previously . the resulting plasmids were used to transform wild type arabidopsis plants for developmental and phenotypic analyses or onion cells for cellular localization studies . based on our previous prrna _METHOD_ construct the prrna was replaced by the promoters of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ through asisi and noti restriction sites respectively . furthermore the _METHOD_ was replaced by kb gus marker gene containing noti xmai restriction sites and pcr amplified using forward primer gusf and reverse primer gusr . the constructs of _PROTEIN_ gus gus and gus were transferred into destination vector _GENE_ through lr recombination reactions . based on gus and gus constructs the gus gene was replaced by bp genome fragment containing the _PROTEIN_ and bp genome fragment of _PROTEIN_ coding sequence to generate _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ complementation vectors . the corresponding primers
