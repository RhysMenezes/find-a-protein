organelle genomes lost a large number of genes after endosymbiosis occurred . even after this major gene loss organelle genomes still lose their own genes even those that are essential via gene transfer to the _LOCATION_ and gene substitution of either different organelle origin or de novo genes . gene transfer and substitution events are important processes in the evolution of the eukaryotic cell . gene loss is an ongoing process in the mitochondria and chloroplasts of higher plants . the gene for ribosomal protein _PROTEIN_ is encoded in the chloroplast genome of most higher plants but not in medicago truncatula and populus alba . here we show that these species have compensated for loss of the _PROTEIN_ from the chloroplast genome by having a mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ that can target the chloroplasts as well as mitochondria . furthermore in arabidopsis thaliana lycopersicon esculentum and oryza sativa whose chloroplast genomes encode the _PROTEIN_ we show that the product of the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ has dual targeting ability . these results suggest that the dual targeting of _PROTEIN_ to the mitochondria and chloroplasts emerged before the divergence of monocots and dicots . the gene substitution of the chloroplast _PROTEIN_ by the _LOCATION_ encoded _PROTEIN_ in higher plants is the first report about ongoing gene substitution by dual targeting and provides evidence for an intermediate stage in the formation of this heterogeneous organelle .
although the order and number of genes on the chloroplast genome are highly conserved in higher plants it has been reported that the _PROTEIN_ is missing from the chloroplast genome of p. alba and p. trichocarpa and m. truncatula . this indicates that the _PROTEIN_ should be transferred from the chloroplast to the _LOCATION_ genome in these species . therefore a tblastn search in tigr est database of the medicago and populus genera was conducted by using the _PROTEIN_ amino acid sequence from the a. thaliana chloroplast genome as a query . two independent ests encoding _PROTEIN_ protein were found in each species from which we obtained rt pcr products . the deduced amino acids from the _PROTEIN_ genes in each species indicate that high amino acid identity remains between both genes . there has been no report that the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ is encoded in the mitochondrial genome to date . and it has been reported that the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ was transferred from the mitochondrial genome to the _LOCATION_ at early stages of eukaryotic evolution . this strongly suggests that the copies of the _LOCATION_ encoded _PROTEIN_ found in p. alba and m. truncatula are the genes transferred from the mitochondrial genome to the _LOCATION_ genome and that the duplication occurred in the past . importantly _PROTEIN_ proteins were predicted to be localized in the mitochondria by the localization prediction _METHOD_ targetp and predotar . however homologues of the _PROTEIN_ in the est database of the medicago and populus genera have never been found . this raises the possibility that mitochondrial ribosomal protein is located not only to the mitochondria but also to the chloroplasts . here it should be noted that localization prediction _METHOD_ predicted that they would be located to the mitochondria . to evaluate the possibility of the chloroplast targeting ability of the _LOCATION_ encoded _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ we attempted to determine the organelle to which _PROTEIN_ genes in m. truncatula and p. alba were located . their open reading frames obtained by rt pcr were fused to the upstream of the gene for _METHOD_ . the chimeric genes were introduced into a. thaliana suspension cells by a.tumefaciens mediated transfection . _PROTEIN_ of the genes was monitored days after its introduction using confocal laser scanning microscopy . the locations of the chimeric _METHOD_ proteins and the mitochondria stained by mitotracker were visualized as green and red signals respectively . chloroplasts _LOCATION_ were also visualized as red signals by chloroplast targeted _METHOD_ . the _METHOD_ fused proteins of m. truncatula _PROTEIN_ showed the same pattern as the red signals of chloroplast targeted _METHOD_ they were located only in the _LOCATION_ . on the other hand those of m. truncatula _PROTEIN_ and p. alba _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed the same pattern as that of the red signals derived from mitotracker and chloroplast targeted _METHOD_ they were dually targeted to both the mitochondria and _LOCATION_ . these results strongly suggest that the _LOCATION_ encoded _PROTEIN_ genes in m. truncatula and p. alba have substituted for the _PROTEIN_ protein encoded in chloroplast genomes . o. sativa and a. thaliana whose chloroplast genomes encode the _PROTEIN_ each have _PROTEIN_ genes in independent _LOCATION_ loci . the _PROTEIN_ genes in each species retained high amino acid identity between them as found for m. truncatula and p. alba . the deduced amino acids of _PROTEIN_ in higher plants show similarities . this suggests that the _PROTEIN_ genes in a. thaliana and o. sativa whose chloroplast genomes encode the _PROTEIN_ also have the capability of dual targeting to the mitochondria and chloroplasts similarly to p. alba and m. truncatula . to evaluate this possibility the deduced amino acids from _PROTEIN_ genes in a. thaliana and o. sativa were fused to the upstream of the gene for _METHOD_ and introduced into a. thaliana suspension cells . results indicate that in a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ could be dually targeted to the mitochondria and _LOCATION_ . interestingly the _PROTEIN_ could not be located to the mitochondria clearly although it could be targeted to the _LOCATION_ . in o. sativa both _PROTEIN_ proteins could be localized in the mitochondria and chloroplasts . the above results strongly suggest that the gene substitution event of the chloroplast _PROTEIN_ had already occurred via the dual targeting ability of the _LOCATION_ encoded _PROTEIN_ that is in the intermediate stage in a. thaliana and o. sativa . the above plants have copies of the _PROTEIN_ in their _LOCATION_ genome . however in some plants blast search results suggest that only a single copy of the _PROTEIN_ is encoded in the _LOCATION_ genome . for example we could find only a single copy of the _PROTEIN_ in l. esculentum v.vinifera and l. japonicus . phylogenetic analysis indicates that their _PROTEIN_ genes were grouped into the dual targeting _PROTEIN_ genes . of them we obtained rt pcr products of the _LOCATION_ encoded _PROTEIN_ in l. esculentum and the orf of this gene was fused to the upstream of the gene for _METHOD_ . we confirmed that _METHOD_ fused _PROTEIN_ protein from l. esculentum has the dual targeting ability to the mitochondria and _LOCATION_ . this result strongly suggests that the gene substitution of the chloroplast _PROTEIN_ is in the intermediate stage in l. esculentum because the l. esculentum chloroplast genome also contains the _PROTEIN_ as does a. thaliana and o. sativa . we showed that the _LOCATION_ encoded _PROTEIN_ genes were dually targeted to the mitochondria and chloroplasts in a. thaliana l. esculentum and o. sativa whose chloroplast genomes encode the _PROTEIN_ . the results suggest that the gene substitution of chloroplast _PROTEIN_ is the intermediate stage in them . our results also suggest that the chloroplast encoded _PROTEIN_ has already been silenced and has become a pseudogene by the _LOCATION_ encoded _PROTEIN_ . it is reported that chloroplast encoded _PROTEIN_ has become a pseudogene in phaseolus vulgaris because of the generation of nonsense mutation . the chloroplast genomes of m. truncatula and p.vulgaris in legumes have already lost and silenced _PROTEIN_ respectively . there is a possibility that the chloroplast encoded _PROTEIN_ has already been silenced in legumes . the complete chloroplast genome sequences of g. max and l. japonicus are available in legumes and their chloroplast genomes encode _PROTEIN_ . therefore to confirm whether or not the chloroplast encoded _PROTEIN_ is active we conducted rt pcr experiment in plants g. max l. esculentum l. japonicus and o. sativa . in a. thaliana the _PROTEIN_ analysis for genes containing intron on chloroplast genome was thoroughly performed by citation and they revealed that the chloroplast encoded _PROTEIN_ is transcribed and spliced . in the results of rt pcr spliced mrnas of the chloroplast encoded _PROTEIN_ genes were detected and we confirmed that spliced transcript actually encoded the chloroplast encoded _PROTEIN_ by sequencing . this result strongly suggests that the gene substitution of the chloroplast _PROTEIN_ is the intermediate stage in a. thaliana g. max l. esculentum l. japonicus and o. sativa . it was revealed that _PROTEIN_ proteins are located to the mitochondria and chloroplasts . generally transferred genes from an organelle to the _LOCATION_ must obtain a sequence in the upstream of mature protein targeting the gene product to the organelle . however in comparison of _PROTEIN_ proteins in _METHOD_ to _PROTEIN_ protein in e. coli no n terminal extension sequence is found in higher plants such as _METHOD_ . this suggests that mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ genes have acquired targeting information within their mature proteins . to determine the location of the mitochondrial and chloroplast targeting signals we prepared deleted constructs of a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ . sequences corresponding to the n terminal and amino acids of the a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ were fused to the gene for _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ fused proteins of the sequence encoding the n terminal amino acids of a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ showed ambiguous localization in the cell . on the other hand the other _METHOD_ fused proteins showed specific localization patterns in the cell . in the case of the n terminal amino acids the _METHOD_ fused protein could be located in the mitochondria and slightly in the _LOCATION_ . the _METHOD_ fused to the n terminal and amino acids also showed a similar localization pattern to that of the n terminal amino acids . the _METHOD_ fused protein of the n terminal amino acids was able to localize in the mitochondria and _LOCATION_ because similar localization patterns were found in all orf fused proteins . our results strongly suggest that important amino acids for mitochondrial and chloroplast targeting signals are contained within the n terminal and amino acids respectively .
