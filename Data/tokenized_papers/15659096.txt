chloroplast development requires coordinated _PROTEIN_ of both _LOCATION_ and chloroplast encoded genes . to better understand the roles played by _LOCATION_ encoded chloroplast proteins in chloroplast biogenesis we isolated an arabidopsis mutant _PROTEIN_ which has a dual phenotype reduced chlorophyll accumulation and abnormal hypocotyl gravicurvature . subsequent map based cloning and dna sequencing of the mutant gene revealed a bp deletion in an _PROTEIN_ gene which encodes a kda metalloprotease that contains eight trans _LOCATION_ domains at its c terminus and carries out casein degradation in an _PROTEIN_ independent manner . _PROTEIN_ protein accumulation varies between tissue types being most prominent in leaf and stem tissues and is responsive to light and ethylene . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ hybrid proteins are localized in the chloroplast . _PROTEIN_ mutant chloroplasts had reduced granal _LOCATION_ and poorly developed lamellae networks . furthermore the accumulation of chlorophyll a/b binding proteins of the light harvesting complexes i and ii are significantly _PROTEIN_ in three separate loss of function _PROTEIN_ mutants . taken together these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ metalloprotease is required for chloroplast development and hence a defective _PROTEIN_ gene has pleiotropic effects both on chloroplast development and on ethylene dependent gravitropism of light grown hypocotyls .

seeds of arabidopsis thaliana heynh columbia and wassilewskija ecotype and seeds of and were obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center . growth of arabidopsis and gravicurvature assay has been described previously . the ethylene concentration used to promote gravicurvature of light grown hypocotyls was p.p.m . to genetically map the _PROTEIN_ gene the isolated _PROTEIN_ mutant was crossed with wild type plants . the resulting heterozygous plant was selfed to generate plants and the homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant plants were selected from the segregating population based on phenotypes showing deficient ethylene stimulated gravicurvature as well as yellow green color of cotyledons . genomic dna from these plants was extracted and analyzed for co segregation using available sslp and caps markers . new sslp markers were developed based on the sequence information from cereon database and by searching for simple repeat sequences with the repeatmasker program . primer pairs for sslp and caps markers are described in table . _PROTEIN_ paralogs and orthologs were fetched out from different _METHOD_ using the full length amino acid sequence of _PROTEIN_ in a blast search at ncbi database . multiple sequence alignment of these homologs paralogs and orthologs of _PROTEIN_ protein were constructed using clustalw . the phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using phylip and displayed in tree view . the residue specific hydropathy index was predicted by . localization of the protein was predicted by targetp version . to complement _PROTEIN_ mutant function pcr products amplified from the wild type ws genomic dna by elongase with egygf and egygr primers were digested with bamhi and mlui and then subcloned into the binary vector . the tac clone dna was digested with kpni and bglii and the kb genomic dna fragment containing the _PROTEIN_ coding region was cloned into . both recombinant constructs include the orf of _PROTEIN_ a kb flanking region upstream of the _PROTEIN_ transcript site and a kb dna sequence downstream of the stop codon . the cdna of _PROTEIN_ was obtained by rt pcr using the egycf and egycr primers . the amplified fragment was cloned into resulting in pcambia promoter _PROTEIN_ . to make the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ hybrid protein the pcambia _PROTEIN_ cdna construct was employed as a template and the orf of _PROTEIN_ was obtained by pcr using primers egyff and egyfr . the dna fragment encoding _METHOD_ was amplified from _METHOD_ using primers _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . the ncoi/kpni double digested cdna fragment and the kpni/mlui double digested _METHOD_ fragment were ligated with the vector predigested with ncoi/mlui . the resulting _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ recombinant construct encodes a hybrid protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the _METHOD_ construct was used as a control and both recombinant inserts were sequenced to ensure the authenticity of the transgenes . all these recombinant constructs were introduced into arabidopsis using the floral dip method . transformants were selected on _METHOD_ medium containing mg hygromycin . green _METHOD_ signals from _METHOD_ and red _METHOD_ signals from chlorophyll were analyzed with a leica confocal laser scanning microscope . transmission electron microscopic studies of arabidopsis tissues followed the standard method described by citation . the samples were observed through a jeol transmission electron microscope . the kb orf of _PROTEIN_ was amplified by pcr using primers egyef and egyer . this cdna fragment was cloned into the bamhi site of pgex to generate a glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein . the n terminal region of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was amplified using egynf and egynr primers . the cdna fragment was cloned into bamhi site of pgex to produce a recombinant fusion protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein . the dna sequences of these fusion genes were verified by dna sequencing and fusion proteins were _PROTEIN_ in e. coli strain plyss and isolated as previously described . the hybrid proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ that had been _PROTEIN_ and purified from e. coli were mixed with of casein substrate and incubated at for various times in a reaction buffer containing mm tris acetate ph mm nacl mm mg acetate zn acetate bsa mercaptoethanol . the reactions were supplemented with mm _PROTEIN_ when necessary . the protease inhibitors used in the reaction included o phenanthroline and the complete a protease inhibitor cocktail . at the end of the incubations laemmli solubilizing buffer was added and the samples were stored on ice before being subjected to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ analysis on acrylamide gels . the remaining casein quantities in each reaction were determined with an eagle eye image program by quantifying the intensity of the _METHOD_ brilliant blue r stained casein band in the gel . antibodies against _PROTEIN_ protein were raised by immunizing rabbits with the highly purified n terminal region of _PROTEIN_ . the antibody raised against _LOCATION_ sorting receptor proteins was a gift from dr liwen jiang . anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies and anti rubicso activase antibodies were _PROTEIN_ from santa cruz biotechnology .
