we describe a proteomics method for determining the subcellular localization of _LOCATION_ proteins . organelles are partially separated using centrifugation through self generating density gradients . proteins from each organelle co fractionate and therefore exhibit similar distributions in the gradient . protein distributions can be determined through a series of pair wise comparisons of gradient fractions using cleavable icat to enable relative quantitation of protein levels by _METHOD_ . the localization of novel proteins is determined using multivariate data analysis techniques to match their distributions to those of proteins that are known to reside in specific organelles . using this approach we have simultaneously demonstrated the localization of _LOCATION_ proteins in both the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ apparatus in arabidopsis . localization of organelle proteins by isotope tagging is a new tool for high throughput protein localization which is applicable to a wide range of research areas such as the study of organelle function and protein trafficking .
the basis of the lopit technique is outlined in fig . . organelles were prepared from arabidopsis callus and partially separated according to their density using self generating iodixanol gradients . iodixanol is an alternative media to sucrose which has the advantage of being able to form density gradients from homogenous solutions within a few hours of high speed centrifugation . these self generating gradients are extremely reproducible and simple to manipulate because their shape depends only on the starting iodixanol concentration and the centrifugation time . to determine the distribution of the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ apparatus gradient fractions were analyzed by western blot using antibodies against the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ and the _LOCATION_ marker gtl . the density gradient centrifugation only partially separated these organelles . furthermore proteomic analysis of the peak _LOCATION_ fraction by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ followed by lc _METHOD_ resulted in the identification of _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ proteins as well as numerous proteins from other compartments including the pm mitochondria and _LOCATION_ making it impossible to assign localizations to novel proteins . in contrast lopit involves the analysis of protein distribution across the gradients rather than the cataloguing of single fractions . this enables proteins from different organelles to be distinguished even if their distributions overlap . a comparison of fractions three and six for example could be used to distinguish _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ residents because the _LOCATION_ is more abundant in fraction six than in fraction three while the _LOCATION_ exhibits the opposite distribution . by comparing the distributions of novel proteins to those of known organelle residents using the multivariate data analysis techniques pca and _PROTEIN_ da the subcellular localization of novel proteins can be determined . to determine the distributions of the proteins in the density gradient fractions we utilized the cleavable icat reagents from applied _METHOD_ . icat enables the relative quantitation of protein levels in two samples by _METHOD_ . in total six pair wise comparisons were performed across the density gradient . the integral _LOCATION_ proteins in each fraction were enriched by subjecting the _LOCATION_ to a high ph wash which removes the majority of soluble and peripheral _LOCATION_ proteins . the proteins were then labeled with cleavable icat reagents which specifically react with cysteine sulfhydryls . in each comparison the least dense fraction was labeled with the light icat reagent and the denser fraction with the heavy reagent . the two fractions in each comparison were then pooled and protein digestion followed by avidin affinity purification of the labeled peptides was performed . each sample was then analyzed by lc _METHOD_ resulting in the confident identification and quantification of proteins . of these proteins were predicted to be integral _LOCATION_ proteins with having two or more trans _LOCATION_ spans re confirming the applicability of icat technology to the analysis of hydrophobic integral _LOCATION_ proteins . thirteen of the proteins identified have been previously localized to specific organelles in arabidopsis while a further had predicted subcellular locations based on homology to proteins in other plants animals or yeast . these proteins are listed in table i . for the purpose of validating the lopit technique the remainder of this study focuses on this set of proteins . a detailed discussion of the remaining proteins is beyond the scope of this article and will be reported elsewhere . to validate the lopit technique the localization of the predicted _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ proteins listed in table i was attempted . manual analysis of the large datasets generated in these experiments is time consuming and _LOCATION_ prone . therefore pca was used to condense the dataset and identify patterns within it . in this case pca was used to reduce the six variable dataset to a two variable scores plot . principal component is a best fit vector that represents the greatest correlated variation in the dataset . represents the greatest variation at right angles to _PROTEIN_ and is also the next most amount of correlated variation in the dataset . the scores for the two pcs for an individual protein describe the position of that protein in relation to these two new axes and the other proteins contributing to the model . proteins that have similar distributions across the density gradient will cluster with one another in the pc scores plot . although the two pcs represent variation across the total group analyzed _PROTEIN_ can be loosely defined as a measure of the likelihood a protein is either _LOCATION_ mitochondria or _LOCATION_ localized _PROTEIN_ or found localized in the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . in a similar manner distinguishes mitochondrial and _LOCATION_ proteins from _LOCATION_ proteins . fig . clearly shows that the known _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ proteins form clusters that are distinct from one another and from the mitochondrial _LOCATION_ and pm proteins . in this analysis the predicted _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ proteins also cluster tightly with the known residents of their respective organelles thus supporting the predicted localizations of these proteins . these results demonstrate that using this method it is possible to distinguish proteins that are localized to different subcellular compartments without the need to purify individual organelles . we can also begin to assign the unknown proteins to subcellular compartments because the majority of them cluster with the known organelle residents . the remaining proteins which do not cluster with the marker proteins may be residents of organelles for which no known resident proteins have been identified such as the endosome . alternatively these proteins may be localized to multiple compartments . in order to assess whether protein clustering was reproducible the experiment was repeated using a second _LOCATION_ preparation . a total of of the proteins that were identified in the original experiment were also found in the repeat . the distributions of these proteins in the two experiments were again analyzed using pca . fig . shows the _PROTEIN_ scores obtained for each protein in the two repeats of the experiment . in each case _PROTEIN_ represents the maximum amount of correlated variation in the two pca models . in both models _PROTEIN_ distinguished the combined group of the _LOCATION_ mitochondrial and _LOCATION_ proteins from the _LOCATION_ proteins . the strong correlation observed between the original scores and those obtained in the repeat indicates that the clustering and therefore the localization of proteins by lopit is reproducible . visual clustering of proteins based on their positions in the pc scores plot is a useful method for initial data analysis . however the assignment of novel proteins to organelles requires a discriminate approach that can predict class membership . as a result _PROTEIN_ da which is a regression extension of pca was used . _PROTEIN_ da is a technique that can be used to predict the class membership of observations in a large multidimensional dataset based on a training set of observations with known class membership . in this case the known _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and mitochondrial/plastid proteins identified in the first experiment were assigned to three classes and used to build a _PROTEIN_ da model which was used to determine the localization of the remaining proteins . the _PROTEIN_ da scores for the proteins in the training and test sets are listed in table i . using the stringent cut off described above lopit confirmed the _LOCATION_ localization of five of the seven predicted _LOCATION_ proteins and five of the six predicted _LOCATION_ proteins . the remaining two predicted _LOCATION_ proteins are also very likely to be _LOCATION_ localized given their high scores for _LOCATION_ localization which fall just below the threshold and their low scores for the other compartments . ribophorin i the sole predicted _LOCATION_ protein whose localization was not confirmed has a high _LOCATION_ score of but also a reasonable _LOCATION_ score of . this protein may be present in a different subdomain of the _LOCATION_ than the proteins in the training and test sets . _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins continuously escape from the _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ and are retrieved in retrograde vesicles . the magnitude of the ribophorin i _LOCATION_ score could therefore reflect the steady state distribution of this protein with the majority resident in the _LOCATION_ and a minority in the _LOCATION_ awaiting retrieval .
a. thaliana liquid callus cultures _PROTEIN_ a myc tagged version of gtl were established and _PROTEIN_ as described . approximately g of callus were homogenized in homogenization buffer at using a polytron with a _PROTEIN_ head attachment for two pulses of s. the homogenate was then centrifuged twice for min at g. the supernatant was loaded onto a ml iodixanol cushion and centrifuged at g for h in a rotor . crude _LOCATION_ were then collected from the interface and adjusted to iodixanol . these _LOCATION_ were then fractionated according to their density by centrifuging at g for h in a rotor during which time an iodixanol gradient is generated . fractions of ml were harvested from the top of the gradient using an auto densi flow collection device . _LOCATION_ from each density gradient fraction were diluted with ml of cold deionized water pelleted by centrifugation at g for min in a tla rotor and resuspended in of _PROTEIN_ sample buffer . then of each fraction was heated at for min and then resolved on a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gel processed for western analysis according to wee et al . and probed with rabbit anti myc and anti antibodies . to remove soluble and _LOCATION_ associated proteins ml of cold mm was added to each density gradient fraction . after min on ice the washed _LOCATION_ were pelleted as above . after removing the supernatant the pellet was washed with ml of cold de ionized water and then re pelleted by centrifuging at g for min . the second supernatant was removed and the _LOCATION_ pellets solubilized in of labeling buffer _PROTEIN_ . the protein concentration of each fraction was then determined using the dc protein assay kit . using cleavable icat reagents _METHOD_ six pair wise comparisons were performed on the first fractions collected where is the least dense fraction and the most dense versus versus versus versus versus and versus and . for each comparison the lighter fraction was labeled with the light icat reagent and the denser fraction with the heavy icat reagent . labeling was performed according to the standard applied _METHOD_ icat protocol _METHOD_ with the following exceptions labeling buffer _PROTEIN_ was used in place of denaturing buffer _PROTEIN_ reduction was performed for min at labeling was performed at excess icat reagents were quenched by the addition of mm cysteine after labeling and then incubated at for min before pooling the samples prior to digestion the pooled samples were diluted to ml with mm tris hcl ph of modified trypsin were then added prior to the cation exchange step samples were diluted to ml with mm ph acn . after cleavage samples were resuspended in of acn tfa . peptide separation by lc _METHOD_ was performed using an ultimate nano lc system and a _PROTEIN_ xl q tof hybrid _METHOD_ spectrometer _METHOD_ . samples were delivered to the system using a famos autosampler at and the peptides were trapped onto a pepmap pre column . peptides were then eluted onto the pepmap analytical column at nl/min and separated using a h gradient of acn . the _PROTEIN_ xl was operated in information de pend ent acquisition mode in which a s tof _METHOD_ scan from m/z was performed followed by s product ion scans from m/z on the two most intense doubly or triply charged ions . each sample was analyzed three times to improve the quantitation accuracy and identification confidence . _METHOD_ data files were analyzed using proicat software version service pack _METHOD_ and searched against the mips arabidopsis protein database . peptides identified with less than confidence were excluded . multiple peptide matches resulting from the same _METHOD_ data were removed using microsoft access with the queries included in the proicat software . to further increase identification stringency the proteins identified using proicat were verified by analyzing the _METHOD_ data using mascot daemon version _PROTEIN_ . proteins with scores above were identified with confidence . proteins positively identified by proicat but with mascot scores below this threshold were discarded . in addition the proteins with mascot scores below were verified by manual inspection of the corresponding _METHOD_ spectra . proicat automatically measures the ratio of the heavy labeled peptide to the light labeled peptide . the heavy to light ratio for each protein is the mean ratio of its component peptides from the three _METHOD_ runs . only proteins with quantification information from at least four of the six icat comparisons were included in the final results table . prediction of trans _LOCATION_ helices was performed using the web based tmhmm software . the logged icat ratios obtained for each protein in the initial experiment and the repeat were imported into the _PROTEIN_ package and pre processed with mean centered scaling . the data was analyzed by principle components analysis for the two experiments and the proteins represented in two dimensional scores plots . this approach summarizes the correlated variation in the dataset in an unsupervised manner allowing the visualization of clusters within the dataset . to measure the significance of these clusters in _METHOD_ of the proteins of known sub compartmentalization the known _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and mitochondrial/plastid proteins identified in the first experiment were then assigned to three classes and used to build a partial least squares discriminant analysis _PROTEIN_ model . this is a supervised pattern recognition approach that uses the class membership information to maximize the separation between these proteins . the success of this approach was measured using a goodness of fit algorithm that produced a score where is no better than chance and is the theoretical maximum for a component that explains all the variation in the data and correctly classifies the dataset . this model was then used to predict the localization of the remaining proteins . the _PROTEIN_ da results consist of three values for each protein that indicate how well that protein fits the three localizations where values closest to one indicate a good fit with the pattern associated with that localization . the lowest scoring known organelle resident in each class was used as the threshold for assigning confident organelle localizations to proteins . the thresholds were therefore for the _LOCATION_ for the _LOCATION_ and for the mitochondria/plastid class .
