divalent metal binding proteins in the arabidopsis mitochondrial proteome were analysed by mobility shifts in the presence of divalent cations during two dimensional diagonal sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and searches of the predicted arabidopsis protein dataset were used in an attempt to identify of the proteins which shifted . this analysis identified a total of distinct protein spots as the products of at least different arabidopsis genes . a series of proteins known to be divalent cation binding proteins or to catalyse divalent cation dependent reactions were identified . these included succinyl coa ligase subunit mn superoxide dismutase an fe s centred component of complex i and the reiske iron sulphur protein of the b/c complex . a further set of four proteins of known function but without known divalent binding properties were also identified the vb subunit of cytochrome c oxidase a subunit of _PROTEIN_ synthase _PROTEIN_ the acyl carrier protein and the translocase of the outer _LOCATION_ . three other proteins of unknown function were also found to shift in the presence of divalent cations . this approach has broad application for the identification of sub proteomes based on the metal interaction of polypeptides .
when protein samples were subjected to d _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ without treatment lanes excised rotated and again subjected to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ they gave an expected diagonal straight line of protein products observed in . on the other hand when electrophoresis was carried out without treatment in the first dimension but with cacl in the second dimension a series of protein spots were apparent that had shifted from the straight diagonal . these protein spots represent polypeptides whose mobility in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ changes with the availability of cacl . clearly most proteins present in mitochondrial samples were unaffected by this treatment and only a very small number of discrete proteins shift in response to increased metal cation concentration . when electrophoresis was carried out first in the presence of cacl and then in its absence again protein spots not aligned to the diagonal were detected . when treatments with cacl or edta were performed in both first and second dimensions no protein spots migrating off the diagonal were observed . kameshita and fujisawa showed that many of the spots that migrate differentially in the presence of ca also do so in the presence of mg . many functional studies have shown that the endogenous divalent metal centres of proteins can often be extensively interchanged in vitro . such changes may or may not adversely affect the function of these proteins . this strongly suggests that while the shifts induced by cacl in this study are probably reflective of the presence of divalent metal binding sites they may not indicate that ca is the specific endogenous ligand of all the proteins . we have used the mobility shift approach outlined above in the presence and absence of cacl or the chelator edta to probe for metal binding proteins . edta provided more stringent stripping of metals before first dimension electrophoresis or after initial electrophoresis in the presence of metal ions . the patterns of spots which shifted during the four treatments are shown in and the spots excised from gel pieces for analysis are highlighted in . after in gel digestion and peptide elution samples from each protein spot were subjected to tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ data matched to databases of theoretical arabidopsis proteins . this analysis identified of the shifting protein spots as shown in _PROTEIN_ . while protein spots were identified these only represented different arabidopsis gene loci indicating that some proteins were found more than once . three proteins were only identified once six proteins were identified twice and two proteins were identified three or five times in the analysis . spots and could not be unambiguously identified due to lack of sufficient peptide matches to single arabidopsis protein entries and are not included in _PROTEIN_ . succinyl coa synthetase hydrolyses the high energy compound succinyl coa with the coupled synthesis of _PROTEIN_ in mammals and _PROTEIN_ in plants . the plant enzyme has received little attention and the only detailed work on its kinetics dates back to a study by palmer and wedding . these researchers highlighted the metal ion cofactor required for this enzyme and showed its function by addition of mg mn or co . succinyl coa synthetase is a heterodimer and our results suggest that the subunit is most likely responsible for the metal binding _PROTEIN_ . the mitochondrial form of superoxide dismutase contains a transition metal centre with a preference for mn . the coordination of this metal by cysteine residues most likely enables other divalent ions to occupy this site and thus explains the shift in in the presence of ca observed in and identified in _PROTEIN_ . the kda subunit of complex i is one of the eight predicted fe s centre proteins of this complex in eukaryotes . the reiske fe s protein of complex iii contains a metal centre vital for the electron transport function of this complex . the strong coordination centre of these fe s centres involves clusters of cysteine residues that will likely coordinate other divalent ions as suggested by the shifts shown in . these four proteins were consistently observed on metal ion shift gels in our hands and provide confirmation that this approach identifies a subset of metal binding proteins . _PROTEIN_ is a putative component of the plant mitochondrial f f o _PROTEIN_ synthase . to our knowledge the data from _PROTEIN_ represent the first evidence of metal ion binding for this protein . the acyl carrier protein is involved in fatty acid biosynthesis and in mitochondria is located within complex i of the respiratory chain where it functions to deliver lipoic acid to the reaction centres of the pyruvate dehydrogenase and oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complexes as well as the h subunit of the glycine decarboxylase complex in plants . if lipoic acid is attached to _PROTEIN_ the sulphdryls present under reducing conditions may allow metal coordination and could explain the shift of this protein . alternatively a distinct metal binding site may be present . the cytochrome oxidase _PROTEIN_ subunit vb is _LOCATION_ encoded and while its exact function in the electron transport chain complex is unknown it is not _PROTEIN_ as a metal binding site in the complex . in mammals _PROTEIN_ has been reported to bind the regulatory subunit of c amp dependent mitochondrial protein kinase and may be involved therefore in the _PROTEIN_ regulation of _PROTEIN_ . whether a similar process occurs in plants has yet to be established . the protein is a receptor on the outer mitochondrial _LOCATION_ involved in import of precursor proteins from the cell _LOCATION_ . we have not found any literature citation of a metal requirement for this receptor . it is possible that the proteins found here do not all bind metals in their native state as our experiments were all performed under denaturing conditions . determination of whether these findings translate to a metal binding characteristic of the native protein will require further experimentation but this research has highlighted candidates for such analysis . the three proteins of unknown function presented in _PROTEIN_ represent potentially novel metal binding proteins in plant mitochondria . similarity searches with protein sequences yielded best matches for two of the proteins to other unknown function proteins in yeast _PROTEIN_ . one of the three has some similarity to a protein in rickettsia the closest related living bacteria to the likely progenitor of modern mitochondria which is similar to the thioltransferase proteins known as glutaredoxins . all three proteins are _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis based on our analysis _PROTEIN_ and their apparent representation in est databases _PROTEIN_ . targeting prediction programmes clearly reveal that all three are likely to be authentic mitochondria proteins and not contamination from other cellular sources . kameshita and fujisawa showed perhaps surprisingly that conformational or charge differences induced by metal ion binding to _PROTEIN_ denatured polypeptides were sufficient to significantly shift their apparent molecular _METHOD_ during electrophoresis . kameshita and fujisawa and _PROTEIN_ gye et al . used this assay to show a pattern of shifting polypeptides in protein samples from different mammalian tissues . however apart from the use of known divalent cation binding proteins as controls these authors did not identity these shifting proteins . here we have used the shifting property to purify small quantities of proteins and then identified them with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the analysis revealed a selection of known and unknown putative divalent metal ion binding proteins in plant mitochondria . clearly a range of known metal binding proteins in the mitochondrial electron transport chain metabolism and proteolysis machinery were not identified in our analysis . this suggests their metal binding sites were either not present following detergent denaturation or they did not shift mobility by metal binding . in order to identify these proteins alternative metal affinity methods need to be exploited and/or developed . however in our hands this simple electrophoretic approach provides a valuable initial tool for the enrichment of putative metal binding proteins from complex mixtures and could be broadly and easily applied to other biological _METHOD_ .
