we show subcellular localization of all six arabidopsis thaliana arogenate dehydratases to chloroplasts and stromules . furthermore _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have additional localization patterns suggesting non enzymatic functions and roles as moonlighting proteins .
to determine the subcellular localization of adts full length a. thaliana adts were transiently _PROTEIN_ as _METHOD_ fusions in n. benthamiana leaves . adt genes were cloned upstream of the _METHOD_ coding sequence to _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ tag even if the putative tp is cleaved in planta . adts were tagged with _METHOD_ instead of _METHOD_ to avoid emission spectra overlap with organelle markers tagged with _METHOD_ . leaves of to week old n. benthamiana leaves were co transformed with an a. tumefaciens strain harboring an adt _METHOD_ construct and a strain encoding to enhance recombinant protein _PROTEIN_ . for co localization experiments leaves were also co transformed with a. tumefaciens carrying a plasmid encoded organelle marker . adt _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was confirmed by isolating total protein and performing western blots . as transformation controls non infiltrated tissue pcb without an insert and pcb infiltrated only with were observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy . for all controls only chlorophyll _METHOD_ was detected and no _METHOD_ was observed in the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ channels in the absence of fusion proteins . adts localized to the chloroplast stroma but were also seen within thread like structures _PROTEIN_ or as globular structures _PROTEIN_ near the chloroplast but the _METHOD_ signal did not directly overlap with chlorophyll _METHOD_ . the shape and length of these structures were variable ranging from short and globular to long and narrow protrusions from the chloroplast body . unlike _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ did not localize to chloroplasts but was mostly present in the _LOCATION_ . subcellular localization of adt _METHOD_ fusion proteins and co localization with tp ssrubisco _METHOD_ . adt _METHOD_ subcellular localization patterns . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ localized to stroma and to areas seemingly close to the chloroplast just outside of the _METHOD_ signal generated by chlorophyll . they often appear either in thread like structures _PROTEIN_ or globular structures _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ pattern is distinctly different showing a _LOCATION_ distribution . images were taken at a lower magnification to allow observation of the _METHOD_ signal relative to several chloroplasts . close ups of adt _METHOD_ subcellular localization patterns in relation to tp ssrubisco _METHOD_ . in contrast to the chlorophyll _METHOD_ the tp ssrubisco _METHOD_ is a stroma specific marker that visualizes all stroma filled areas within the chloroplast including stromules . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are found within the _PROTEIN_ body of chloroplast and in stromules while _PROTEIN_ is found within the _LOCATION_ and does not co localize with tp ssrubisco _METHOD_ . we hypothesized that the thread like and globular structures were stromules . to confirm that adts do localize to stromules the adt _METHOD_ fusion constructs were co _PROTEIN_ with the tp of the small subunit of rubisco fused to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . this construct is known to localize to the stroma and therefore can be used to identify stromules . the _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ fusion proteins with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ overlapped with the _METHOD_ of tp ssrubisco _METHOD_ which _METHOD_ that these adts are targeted to stromules within the chloroplasts . the _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not overlap with the _METHOD_ of tp ssrubisco _METHOD_ as _PROTEIN_ is mostly found within the _LOCATION_ . to determine if the tp domain of adts is responsible for chloroplast and stromule localization the tp sequence was _PROTEIN_ as a tp _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein and was detected in chloroplasts and stromules . these data are consistent with the tp being sufficient to target adt sequences to chloroplasts and stromules . localization of adts to the chloroplast is dependent on the transit peptide sequences . to test if the transit peptide sequences are sufficient for the transport of adts to the chloroplast the first amino acids of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were _PROTEIN_ transiently in n. benthamiana leaves . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ displayed a unique localization pattern compared with the other adts . in chloroplasts with no apparent central constriction _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized to a band at the equatorial plane . stacked confocal images showed that _PROTEIN_ formed a _PROTEIN_ around the center of the chloroplast . in elongated chloroplasts with a slight indentation suggestive of an early chloroplast division stage _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized as a band around the middle of the elongation exactly at the point of indentation . in chloroplasts with a clear indentation indicative of a _PROTEIN_ stage of division _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was found at the site of constriction . _PROTEIN_ localization to the poles of chloroplasts was consistent with remnants of the division _PROTEIN_ on daughter chloroplasts . these _PROTEIN_ localization patterns are strikingly similar to those of proteins that are involved in chloroplast division a process requiring placement of multiple proteinaceous _PROTEIN_ followed by constriction that partitions the chloroplast into two equal sized daughter chloroplasts . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ structures consistent with chloroplast division _PROTEIN_ . in addition to being _PROTEIN_ within chloroplasts and stromules _PROTEIN_ was also found to accumulate in places consistent with chloroplast division _PROTEIN_ . the top panel shows _PROTEIN_ forming _PROTEIN_ at the equatorial plate of the chloroplast . on occasion _PROTEIN_ was found in the constriction zone of chloroplasts . in these cases the chloroplasts have a distinct dumb bell shape and the degree of indentation depends on how far the division process has proceeded . in addition _PROTEIN_ accumulated in a spindle like shape that tapers at chloroplast poles . this fusiform _PROTEIN_ accumulation was only found at one pole of the chloroplast and is distinct from a stromule pattern shown in . schematic of chloroplast division stages from top to bottom positioning of chloroplast division _PROTEIN_ slightly constricted chloroplast just prior to division two daughter chloroplast following division . analogous to the _METHOD_ images chloroplasts are shown in red and the position of _PROTEIN_ proteins in blue _PROTEIN_ . to initiate division chloroplasts have to reach a certain size . therefore we argue that chloroplasts with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at the equatorial plane should be the largest as they are in the process of dividing . conversely chloroplasts with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at their pole should be the smallest as they have just recently divided . in addition these two classes should have little variation in size as they represent distinct stages in chloroplast development . in contrast growing chloroplasts should vary in size as they encompass all division stages . while chloroplast volume would be the most accurate way to measure chloroplast size it is difficult to determine . therefore chloroplast size was measured as the length of a chloroplast across its longest axis . chloroplasts from uninfiltrated n. benthamiana plants were used to determine the average size of a chloroplast because they should contain chloroplasts at many different developmental stages and thus different sizes . chloroplast sizes measured in three uninfiltrated plants had an average length of . in chloroplasts with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ present on a pole the average length of these chloroplasts was significantly shorter at . lastly chloroplasts with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized at the equatorial plane were significantly longer at . as predicted the sd from the mean was larger for chloroplasts from uninfiltrated plants consistent with a mixed population of chloroplasts compared with chloroplasts with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at a pole or at the equatorial plane . these data support the hypothesis that the _PROTEIN_ localization patterns we observed are consistent with different chloroplast division stages . comparison of chloroplast lengths a the length of the chloroplast was measured at its longest axis . significantly different from the chloroplasts in the uninfiltrated control as determined by a t test . mutations in genes encoding components of the chloroplast division machinery result in changes to chloroplast morphology . if _PROTEIN_ has a role in chloroplast division it is reasonable to expect that an _PROTEIN_ mutant will have distorted chloroplasts . unlike for other adt genes no a. thaliana t dna insertion line that abolishes _PROTEIN_ mrna production exists . however a point mutation within the coding sequence of the act regulatory domain of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ has been documented in which conversion of a serine to an alanine prevents allosteric inhibition of the enzyme . to determine if _PROTEIN_ affects chloroplast morphology homozygous _PROTEIN_ plants were examined by confocal microscopy and compared with wild type col plants of identical age . chloroplasts in _PROTEIN_ plants differed greatly in appearance and were highly heterogeneous in size and shape . this contrasted with chloroplasts in wild type col which were ovoid in shape and relatively uniform in size . although many _PROTEIN_ chloroplasts were clearly affected by the mutation wild type appearing chloroplasts can still be observed suggesting a partial loss of _PROTEIN_ function . chloroplast morphology and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization is affected by a point mutation in _PROTEIN_ . chloroplasts in wild type a. thaliana col . chloroplasts in _PROTEIN_ a. thaliana mutants . close ups of chloroplasts observed in _PROTEIN_ to show the heterogeneity in shape and size . transiently _PROTEIN_ ftsz _METHOD_ in wild type col localizes as expected to a single _PROTEIN_ at the equatorial plane . in contrast _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localizes as long spiralling filaments within _PROTEIN_ chloroplasts . images of chlorophyll _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are shown separately and merged . ftsz is a tubulin like protein that is a central component of the chloroplast division apparatus . there are two ftsz proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which assemble to form the earliest known division _PROTEIN_ the z _PROTEIN_ within the stroma . as the localization of ftsz in chloroplast division mutants has been used to provide insight into the function of putative division proteins we were interested to determine if ftsz localization was affected in _PROTEIN_ plants . thus we generated an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion construct and _PROTEIN_ it in _PROTEIN_ plants . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in wild type col leaves led to the formation of the expected single _PROTEIN_ . in contrast _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ plants was less organized and formed what appeared to be spirals or multiple _PROTEIN_ . these results demonstrate that deregulation of _PROTEIN_ abolishes proper placement of _PROTEIN_ further supporting an involvement of _PROTEIN_ in chloroplast division . in addition to its chloroplast localization only _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was also detected in _LOCATION_ at dpi . to confirm this finding _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was co infiltrated with a _METHOD_ fusion to the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ a component of the _LOCATION_ pore complex in a. thaliana that was previously shown to localize to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . confocal imaging determined that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized around _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . as _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localizes to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ this result _METHOD_ that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is contained within the _LOCATION_ and localizes uniformly throughout the nucleoplasm . as these results were obtained with constructs using a camv promoter we repeated the experiment and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under control of its native promoter and confirmed the _LOCATION_ localization pattern . to ensure that the observed _LOCATION_ localization is not due to a smaller diffusible cleavage product or to a particularly high level of _PROTEIN_ compared with other adts we performed western blots . the blot containing all adts _PROTEIN_ under the control of the camv promoter shows a low level of cleavage in all lanes . however more cleavage product is seen for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ compared with _PROTEIN_ while no _LOCATION_ localization is observed with either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . the blot showing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the control of its native promoter shows a shadow band of the size of _METHOD_ and yet a very clear _LOCATION_ localization is evident . these results indicate that the _LOCATION_ localization pattern is a bona fide _PROTEIN_ localization . there are additional bands of higher molecular weight that might correspond to adt dimers or even higher multimers . _PROTEIN_ is found in the _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins are unique as they are the only full length adt proteins that were found in the _LOCATION_ . _LOCATION_ show a close association with chloroplasts or with stromules of chloroplasts . both images show _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ within _LOCATION_ . co localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . to determine if _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localizes to the _LOCATION_ it was co _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in n. benthamiana . images of chlorophyll _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are shown merged . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is shown alone and merged with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and chlorophyll _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localizes to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and surrounds _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ confirming that it localizes to the _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transiently _PROTEIN_ with its native _PROTEIN_ promoter also localizes to the _LOCATION_ . western blot of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with its native promoter and visualized with a _METHOD_ antibody is detected at its expected size . as negative controls proteins isolated from leaves transformed with _METHOD_ and are shown . total soluble protein was isolated from transiently transformed leaves and of total soluble protein was size separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . sizes of the protein ladder are given in kda . furthermore we often observed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ containing _LOCATION_ surrounded by chloroplasts that appeared to be connected to the _LOCATION_ through stromules suggesting that _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ localization depends on stromule mediated transport . to test if stromule formation affects the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ we transiently _PROTEIN_ myosin xi tail domains as they were previously shown to inhibit stromule formation through a dominant negative effect on wild type myosin xi . to ensure that these treatments inhibit stromules several control transformations were performed . to visualize stromules in control transformations tp _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was used as it easily visualizes stromules and therefore provides a very sensitive marker to detect stromule inhibition . tp _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was co infiltrated into n. benthamiana leaves with an empty pcb vector a dnmyoxi construct or a dnmyoxi k/gtd construct and the number of chloroplasts having stromules and the length of stromules formed were determined . in plants transformed with an empty vector of chloroplasts had stromules and the average length of these was . infiltration with dnmyoxi _PROTEIN_ the percentage of chloroplasts with stromules compared with that of the control and significantly reduced the average length of stromules to . treatment with dnmyoxi k/gtd also caused a significant _PROTEIN_ in the percentage of chloroplasts with stromules and significantly _PROTEIN_ the average length of stromules to . these results confirm that both myosin domains affect stromule formation . the presence of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ is affected by the ability to form stromules . to determine if _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ is dependent on stromules plants were co infiltrated with tp _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ as a control or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and an empty vector dominant negative myosin xi and myosin xi k respectively . percentage of chloroplasts having stromules . chloroplasts were analyzed if they contained any visible tp _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and were determined to have a stromule if the projection was longer than . in total and chloroplasts were analyzed from plants transformed with an empty vector dnmyoxi and dnmyoxi k/gtd respectively . average length of stromules . a total of and stromules were measured from plants transformed with an empty vector dnmyoxi and dnmyoxi k/gtd respectively . _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . cells were analyzed for _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ only if any _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detectable . a total of and cells were analyzed from plants transformed with an empty vector dnmyoxi and dnmyoxi k/gtd respectively . each experiment was performed on three independent occasions . significant differences as determined by a one way _PROTEIN_ are indicated by different letters . averages _PROTEIN_ of the mean are plotted . to determine if the ability to form stromules affects _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was co _PROTEIN_ with the empty pcb vector dnmyoxi or dnmyoxi k/gtd . the extent of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ localization was _PROTEIN_ as a percentage of cells containing _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . co infiltration with the empty vector control showed that of cells had _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ visible in the _LOCATION_ . in contrast co infiltration with dnmyoxi or dnmyoxi k/gtd showed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was detected in the _LOCATION_ in only and of cells respectively both significant reductions from the control . these data demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ localization is _PROTEIN_ by the same conditions shown to _PROTEIN_ stromule formation . transient transformations using agroinfiltration are widely used in n. benthamiana but have traditionally been difficult in a. thaliana . we were able to transform a. thaliana reliably by growing plants with mm l ascorbic acid which seemed to _PROTEIN_ necrosis of leaves associated with agroinfiltration . as it was not the focus of this study the reason for this was not addressed . however as l ascorbic acid can scavenge damaging reactive oxygen species the increased tolerance of a. thaliana to agroinfiltration may be due to a _PROTEIN_ in oxidative stress . adt _METHOD_ fusion genes were transiently _PROTEIN_ in a. thaliana to confirm that localization in a heterologous host reflected the situation in the native environment . as in n. benthamiana all adt _METHOD_ in a. thaliana with the exception of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which appeared in the _LOCATION_ exhibited stroma and stromule like patterns . similarly the unique localization patterns of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were observed in a. thaliana localizing to the equatorial plane and poles of chloroplasts and to _LOCATION_ respectively . this finding was important as it verifies that the findings in n. benthamiana are not artifacts . adt localization to the stroma and stromules the chloroplast equatorial plane and the _LOCATION_ can also be detected in a. thaliana . to test if the adt patterns determined in n. benthamiana reflect _PROTEIN_ in a. thaliana all six adt _METHOD_ fusion proteins were transiently _PROTEIN_ in a. thaliana col . all images show a merge of chlorophyll and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ through _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localize to stroma and structures resembling stromules of varying shapes and lengths with varying levels of _METHOD_ in the stroma . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localizes outside of chloroplasts in the _LOCATION_ . chloroplast division patterns for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ .
escherichia coli and strains were used for the _PROTEIN_ and amplification of plasmid dna . agrobacterium tumefaciens strain containing ti helper plasmid _PROTEIN_ was used for transformation of nicotiana benthamiana and a. thaliana . agrobacterium tumefaciens strain was used for the transformation of the dominant negative myosin xi and dnmyoxi k/gtd constructs . escherichia coli and a. tumefaciens were grown at in lb medium and at in yeb medium respectively with media supplemented with appropriate antibiotics . three to five week old n. benthamiana were used for localization studies of a. thaliana adts and grown in incubators under h light and h dark with light and dark temperatures set to and respectively . arabidopsis thaliana accession columbia was grown for weeks with the same photoperiod and a light intensity of . arabidopsis thaliana plants grown for transient transformations were watered with a mm l ascorbic acid solution . the _PROTEIN_ mutation is an ethyl methanesulfonate induced point mutation that causes a serine to be replaced by an alanine in the act regulatory domain leading to an enzyme that is unable to respond to phenylalanine mediated allosteric inhibition . primers were designed to amplify full length a. thaliana adt genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and tested . amplified full length adt sequences contain the entire orf including the coding sequence for tps adt/pdt catalytic and act regulatory domains . in addition _PROTEIN_ was cloned as the tp sequence only . primers were designed to include restriction enzyme cleavage and docking sites to allow for directional integration of pcr fragments into the target vector . adt sequences were amplified with platinum taq polymerase high fidelity with previously cloned adt sequences as templates . list of primer sequences a _METHOD_ for/rev amplify cerulean cyan _METHOD_ protein sequence _METHOD_ seq pcb sequencing primer f complementary to the end of the full length adt coding sequence s complementary to the end of the catalytic domain r reverse primer complementary to the end of the adt coding sequence rtp reverse primer complementary to the end of the transit peptide . b italics restriction enzyme docking sites bold restriction enzyme recognition sequence underline nucleotides to _PROTEIN_ frame dotted underline pezt nl vector sequence double underline introduced start or stop codon unformatted original unmodified template sequence . the t dna binary vector pezt nl was used in conjunction with the _PROTEIN_ ti helper plasmid for _PROTEIN_ in planta . adt genes _PROTEIN_ from pezt nl are under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter and are translated as c terminally tagged enhanced green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusions . for co localization studies pezt nl was modified by replacing _METHOD_ flanked by cpoi and xbai sites with the cerulean cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ coding sequence . both pcr amplified _METHOD_ sequences and the empty pezt nl were double digested with cpoi and xbai the resulting fragments were ligated and then transformed into e. coli . positive transformants were selected on lb medium containing gentamicin . the resulting vector was renamed pcb . using the appropriate restriction enzymes adt genes were cloned into pcb and all resulting pcb adt vectors were sequenced to ensure proper fusion and sequence integrity of the adt _METHOD_ sequences . to clone the native _PROTEIN_ promoter kb upstream of the _PROTEIN_ start codon was pcr amplified with primers that added a maubi and a xhoi restriction site . the amplified maubi xhoi fragment was used to replace the camv promoter in pcb _PROTEIN_ generating the vector _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the gateway compatible vector encoding _PROTEIN_ cdna was obtained from the _PROTEIN_ . restriction digest of with hindiii yielded a bp restriction fragment containing _PROTEIN_ flanked by attachmentb sites . this gel purified fragment was then recombined into . the entry clone created was digested with asei and the expected bp fragment encoding _PROTEIN_ flanked by attl sites was isolated and recombined into the destination vector generating an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion construct with _PROTEIN_ regulated by the camv promoter . plasmid dna was isolated from overnight e. coli cultures using an alkaline lysis method and transformed into electrocompetent e. coli or electrocompetent a. tumefaciens using the gene pulser ii system set to kv capacitance and or resistance respectively . immediately following electroporation e. coli and a. tumefaciens cells were incubated for h in non selective lb medium before plating on selective medium . correct insertion of amplicons into plasmid dna of positive e. coli transformants was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion and sequencing of isolated plasmid dna . pcb adts were transformed into a. tumefaciens containing ti helper plasmid _PROTEIN_ . to identify stromules the tp of the small subunit of tobacco rubisco fused to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was used in co localization experiments . this fusion construct is under the control of a camv promoter and after translation the tp guides the fusion protein to the chloroplast stroma where it can be used to identify stromules . the t dna containing binary vector _METHOD_ encoding a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is under the _PROTEIN_ of its native promoter and was used as a _LOCATION_ marker . agrobacterium tumefaciens containing encoding the dominant negative form of either n. benthamiana myosin xi or myosin xi k/gtd was used to inhibit stromule formation . each construct encodes the globular tail domain of the corresponding myosin xi . _PROTEIN_ of the dominant negative constructs in is regulated in planta by the nopaline synthase promoter . nicotiana benthamiana and a. thaliana were transiently transformed by pressure infiltrating cultures of a. tumefaciens . agrobacterium tumefaciens were grown overnight in ml of yeb medium with the appropriate antibiotics . then of the overnight culture was transferred to ml of yeb containing of mm acetosyringone and of m mes and grown until cell density reached an of . cells were collected by centrifugation resuspended in gamborg s solution to a final of and incubated for an additional hour prior to infiltration . for co infiltration equal volumes of a. tumefaciens cultures containing different vectors were combined to _PROTEIN_ a final of . the vector encodes a kda protein from tomato bushy stunt virus which has been shown to enhance transgene _PROTEIN_ through suppression of post transcriptional gene silencing _PROTEIN_ and was added to all transient transformations . a minor variation of this protocol was used for co _PROTEIN_ with tp ssrubisco _METHOD_ as this construct produced a very strong _METHOD_ signal compared with that of adt _METHOD_ . therefore a. tumefaciens strains containing adt _METHOD_ and constructs were infiltrated d before the infiltration of tp ssrubisco _METHOD_ and constructs . in addition a. tumefaciens containing the tp ssrubisco _METHOD_ construct were infiltrated at a lower of . hence visualization of subcellular localization was performed days post infiltration with tp ssrubisco _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . transient transformants were assayed dpi using a leica confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with a water immersion objective . the abaxial surface of leaf tissue was viewed to observe the localization pattern of _METHOD_ proteins in the lower epidermis and in mesophyll cells . _METHOD_ and chlorophyll were excited with a blue diode laser and emission was collected from nm to nm and from nm to nm respectively . _METHOD_ was excited with a nm argon laser and its emission was collected from nm to nm . for co localization experiments _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ emissions were collected sequentially to avoid emission crosstalk of the fluorophore pair . images were analyzed using leica confocal software or imagej . chlorophyll _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was false colored red cyan and yellow respectively . for one protein extract three leaf disc samples were collected from transiently transformed n. benthamiana plants at dpi . total soluble protein _PROTEIN_ was extracted and quantified as described by et al . . for each sample of _PROTEIN_ were size separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the proteins were probed with a primary anti _METHOD_ antibody _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ at a dilution . subsequently a secondary goat anti mouse igg horseradish peroxidase conjugated antibody was used at a dilution . _METHOD_ fusion proteins were visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit . stromule and chloroplast lengths were determined using the measuring tool from imagej . chloroplasts were measured in a straight line across their longest axis . stromules were considered to be any extensions from chloroplasts that were > in length . chloroplasts were analyzed for stromules only if they contained detectable tp _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . for non linear stromules several linear measurements were taken to account for bends and curves and subsequently added together to provide a more accurate measurement of stromule length . _LOCATION_ localized _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was measured as a proportion of total cells exhibiting _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . to determine the proportion of cells having _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ within the _LOCATION_ cells were analyzed only if _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was present in the cell/chloroplast . the proportion of chloroplasts with stromules average stromule and chloroplast lengths and proportion of cells with _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ were analyzed using one way _PROTEIN_ on graphpad prism .
