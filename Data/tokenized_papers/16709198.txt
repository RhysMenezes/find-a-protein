cytokinins are a class of phytohormones that play a critical role in plant growth and development . _PROTEIN_ d an activation tagging mutant shows phenotypes typical of transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the agrobacterium tumefaciens isopentenyltransferase gene that encodes the enzyme catalyzing the first step of cytokinin biosynthesis . the _PROTEIN_ d mutant phenotypes are caused by over _PROTEIN_ of a novel gene _PROTEIN_ . sequence analysis places _PROTEIN_ in a previously uncharacterized family of plant specific proteins . a translational fusion between _PROTEIN_ and the green _METHOD_ protein reporter was localized in the cytoplasm as well as associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ when transiently _PROTEIN_ in onion epidermal cells . analysis of transgenic plants harboring an _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ translational fusion under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter region showed gus activity in vegetative tissues _METHOD_ as well as in floral tissues . cytokinin quantification analysis revealed that adult _PROTEIN_ d plants accumulated higher levels of trans zeatin riboside trans zeatin riboside monophosphate and isopentenyladenine _PROTEIN_ when compared to the wild type . consistent with this result _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were found to be up regulated in a tissue specific manner in _PROTEIN_ d mutants . physiological analysis of the _PROTEIN_ d mutant demonstrated reduced responsiveness to exogenous cytokinin in both root elongation and callus formation assays . taken together our data suggest a role for the novel gene _PROTEIN_ in cytokinin mediated plant development .
in an activation tagging screen of approximately seedlings we identified and cloned the genes causing six independent gain of function mutations that suppress the long hypocotyl phenotype of _PROTEIN_ . this study focuses on the fifth of these mutants identified in our lab _PROTEIN_ d. segregation and southern blot analysis indicated that there was a single locus t dna insertion in _PROTEIN_ d _PROTEIN_ and this t dna insertion was genetically linked to the short hypocotyl mutant phenotype . although _PROTEIN_ d _PROTEIN_ had a dramatically shorter hypocotyl than _PROTEIN_ when grown under white light hypocotyls of the dark grown double mutant were etiolated demonstrating that this mutation does not confer dwarfing in all growth conditions . adult _PROTEIN_ d _PROTEIN_ plants were also smaller than the wild type . seedling and adult phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ d were unaffected when crossed away from the _PROTEIN_ mutation . genomic dna adjacent to the mutating t dna in _PROTEIN_ d _PROTEIN_ was isolated by plasmid rescue . sequencing and subsequent blast analysis of a portion of the rescued genomic dna showed that the site of t dna insertion was on chromosome v in a region covered by bac . the four enhancer elements were inserted nucleotides to the transcriptional start of the putative open reading frame _GENE_ . rt pcr indicated that _GENE_ was over _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ d _PROTEIN_ mutant . to confirm that the _PROTEIN_ d mutant phenotype is caused by the over _PROTEIN_ of _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ plants were transformed with genomic dna containing _GENE_ orf and its promoter region along with the four enhancers . transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with increased _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ have recapitulated the original _PROTEIN_ d _PROTEIN_ phenotype demonstrating that over _PROTEIN_ of _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ is responsible for suppressing the long hypocotyl phenotype of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ d _PROTEIN_ double mutant . adult _PROTEIN_ d plants were dwarfed relative to the wild type and exhibited reduced apical dominance . these plants had curled down dark green leaves which were smaller in size when compared to the wild type . the root system of _PROTEIN_ d was under developed both in the length of the primary root and in the number of _PROTEIN_ roots . under standard greenhouse conditions the _PROTEIN_ d mutant displayed delayed senescence with a life cycle approximately weeks longer than wild type plants . to test whether _PROTEIN_ d s mutant phenotype is caused by enhanced cytokinin levels we grew _PROTEIN_ d and wild type seedlings on medium with or without cytokinin . the _PROTEIN_ d seedling phenotype could largely be phenocopied by supplying wild type seedlings with cytokinin . both _PROTEIN_ d and cytokinin treated wild type seedlings showed epinastic cotyledons and inhibited root development including shorter _PROTEIN_ roots and fewer _PROTEIN_ roots . compared with untreated seedlings _PROTEIN_ d seedlings treated with cytokinin were smaller in size and had shorter primary roots indicating that _PROTEIN_ d still responded to exogenous cytokinin . the _PROTEIN_ gene has no introns and is predicted to encode a novel protein of amino acids . database searches revealed that two sob five like proteins of unknown function in arabidopsis and two in rice shared conserved domains with _PROTEIN_ . in addition _PROTEIN_ sequence tags from different higher plant species including rape apple and poplar were found to contain open reading frames with significant sequence similarity to _PROTEIN_ in the same region . the most pronounced sequence similarity was found at the n terminus . all proteins contain the same first three n terminal amino acids and two blocks of conserved domains separated by a stretch of less conserved amino acids . the most highly conserved motif esgwtmy was found in the first domain of all nine sequences . the c terminus of the aligned proteins showed significantly less sequence similarity . no strong homology to known signal sequences was identified in _PROTEIN_ . to examine the intracellular distribution of this protein its coding region was translationally fused to the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ gene and the fusion protein was transiently _PROTEIN_ in onion epidermal cells . _METHOD_ distribution was examined with both _METHOD_ and bright field microscopy . the _METHOD_ signal was found in the cytoplasm as well as associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of onion epidermal cells . no signal was detected in the _LOCATION_ . to determine whether the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion was localized in the cell wall plasmolysis was induced with m mannitol . _METHOD_ signal was only present within the shrunken _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was not localized in the cell wall . to obtain an overview of the endogenous _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ wild type arabidopsis plants were transformed with a construct encoding an _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ translational fusion protein which was _PROTEIN_ using bp of genomic dna of the _PROTEIN_ open reading frame _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . multiple homozygous lines with single locus insertions which showed varying degrees of _PROTEIN_ d mutant phenotype were selected . the severity of the _PROTEIN_ d phenotype for these lines correlated with their _PROTEIN_ gus mrna levels indicating that the fusion protein is functional . histochemical analysis was conducted on three independent lines that had wild type phenotypes . in vegetative tissues gus activity was present in the trichomes of rosette leaves hydathodes of rosette and cauline leaves shoot _METHOD_ and throughout the entire root . gus staining for hydathodes in young and developing leaves was stronger than in mature fully developed leaves . for floral tissues gus activity was observed in the pistil tip developing anthers and sepal vasculature . as the flower matured gus activity in anthers _PROTEIN_ to below the limit of detection and only weak gus activity was observed in the sepal vasculature . weak gus staining was detected in the tips of developing siliques but not in mature ones . taken together these data indicate that the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ is higher in young and developing tissues than in mature ones . _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gus translational fusion was also examined in day old seedlings grown in the dark or in continuous white light . this provided a means to assess whether there were any apparent effects of light upon the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ . gus staining was present in roots and hypocotyl root junctions for both light and dark grown seedlings . however gus staining was only observed in the hydathode region of cotyledons of light grown seedlings but was present in the whole unopened cotyledons of dark grown seedlings indicating that light can affect the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ in cotyledons . to test the hypothesis that the mutant phenotype of _PROTEIN_ d is caused by increased endogenous cytokinin levels the content of isoprenoid cytokinins was measured in week old _PROTEIN_ d and wild type plants . there was a significant increase in the levels of trans zeatin riboside and trans zeatin riboside monophosphate with and fold elevation in _PROTEIN_ d respectively when compared to the wild type . there was also a approximately threefold increase in the levels of adenine _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ d plants relative to the wild type . a slight but significant increase in accumulation in _PROTEIN_ d plants compared to the wild type was found in the cases of trans zeatin _PROTEIN_ cis zeatin _PROTEIN_ and adenosine . no other cytokinins exhibited significant changes in _PROTEIN_ d . the content of dihydrozeatin derivatives _PROTEIN_ as well as cis zeatin and its derivatives cis zeatin _PROTEIN_ and cis zeatin o _PROTEIN_ were close to or below the detection limit in both _PROTEIN_ d and wild type plants . to further investigate whether _PROTEIN_ s function has some connection with cytokinin signal transduction we examined the sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ d and wild type plants to exogenous cytokinins using two different procedures root elongation and callus formation . in the root elongation assay _PROTEIN_ d and wild type seedlings were grown on medium containing different concentrations of benzyladenine . ba inhibited root growth for all the plants at concentrations of nm and higher . compared with wild type plants _PROTEIN_ d showed the same trend of growth inhibition but exhibited less sensitivity to ba especially at and nm . consistent with these results _PROTEIN_ d root explants produced slightly less and smaller callus than control explants at and ng kinetin in the callus formation assay . to further explore _PROTEIN_ s function the _PROTEIN_ of nine atipt genes was examined via rt pcr in four types of tissue isolated from _PROTEIN_ d and the wild type roots rosette leaves of week old plants rosette leaves of flowering plants and flowers . among these nine genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrna levels were up regulated in rosette leaves of flowering _PROTEIN_ d plants . _PROTEIN_ was also up regulated in the flowers of _PROTEIN_ d . no obvious changes were observed for the other atipt genes . these data indicate that the over _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ results in elevated _PROTEIN_ of a subset of atipt genes which is consistent with the increased cytokinin levels in _PROTEIN_ d. although two transposon insertion mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were found for the _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ neither of them had obvious mutant phenotypes . these may not be null mutations however as neither insertion disrupts the conserved domains of sofl proteins and partial transcripts containing these domains could be detected in each mutant . an alternative approach to investigate the loss of function of the _PROTEIN_ gene is to silence it by rna interference . three low complexity regions exist in _PROTEIN_ making it difficult to use the whole cdna as the target sequence . there are also small regions showing similarity to other genes between low complexity regions a and b . thus a bp fragment specific to the _PROTEIN_ transcript was used as target for rnai . the steady state transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ were reduced in the resulting transgenic plants but no obvious mutant phenotypes were observed . the lack of phenotypic changes for rnai transgenic plants may be due to the possible functional redundancy between _PROTEIN_ and the two _PROTEIN_ proteins or insufficient reduction of _PROTEIN_ transcript level . to test the efficiency of the _PROTEIN_ rnai construct it was transformed into _PROTEIN_ d plants . some of the resulting transgenic plants exhibited a reduction in _PROTEIN_ d mutant morphology whereas others were nearly identical to the wild type . further analysis indicated that the extent of the phenotypic reversion is negatively correlated with the steady state mrna level of _PROTEIN_ . rt pcr analysis also demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcript accumulation levels were not reduced by _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ rnai construct indicating the specificity of _PROTEIN_ rnai .
