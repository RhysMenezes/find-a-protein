_PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are key regulators of _LOCATION_ traffic . among them _PROTEIN_ a widely conserved sub group has evolved in a unique way in plants plant _PROTEIN_ members show notable diversity whereas yeast and animals have only a few _PROTEIN_ members . fifty seven _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are encoded in the arabidopsis thaliana genome of which are classified in the _PROTEIN_ group _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . although several plant _PROTEIN_ members have been shown to play pivotal roles in plant unique developmental processes including cytokinesis and tip growth molecular and physiological functions of the majority of _PROTEIN_ members remain unknown . to reveal precise functions of plant _PROTEIN_ we investigated the subcellular localization and dynamics of the largest sub group of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which has nine members . _PROTEIN_ members reside on mobile punctate structures adjacent to the trans _LOCATION_ network and co localized with _PROTEIN_ r snare proteins that operate in the secretory pathway . in addition the constitutive active mutant of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was present on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the _PROTEIN_ containing _LOCATION_ structures showed actin dependent dynamic motion . vesicles labeled by _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ moved dynamically forming queues along actin filaments . interestingly arabidopsis plants whose four major _PROTEIN_ members were knocked out and those _PROTEIN_ the dominant negative mutant of _PROTEIN_ exhibited hypersensitivity to salinity stress . altogether these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ members mediate transport between the trans _LOCATION_ network and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and are required for salinity stress tolerance .
in a. thaliana the _PROTEIN_ sub group has nine members _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . first we compared the _PROTEIN_ profiles of these members from the arabidopsis information resource database _PROTEIN_ using dart to access and organize the microarray data . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are abundant in the whole plant body whereas _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in roots . the other four members _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in flowers . next we generated transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins under the control of their native regulatory elements and examined their _PROTEIN_ patterns . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were observed in all parts of the plant body but their _PROTEIN_ patterns were slightly different . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were abundant in the division zones of shoots and roots . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was high in the stele and low in other areas . _PROTEIN_ was detected only in roots especially in root hair cells . consistent with the tair microarray data _PROTEIN_ was detected only in pollen tubes . thus _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are major members of the _PROTEIN_ sub group that are _PROTEIN_ throughout all tissues although the tair data predicted modest _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in vegetative parts as well . detailed observation of growing root hairs showed characteristic accumulation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the tip region of root hairs . the pollen specific member _PROTEIN_ also accumulated in the tip region of growing pollen tubes . the amino acid sequence similarities among _PROTEIN_ proteins are considerably high approximately . these results imply that the five _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ members and perhaps other members as well are involved in related transport processes even though they are _PROTEIN_ in different tissues . in this report we analyzed _PROTEIN_ as the representative of the _PROTEIN_ sub group because it is the most abundant in major tissues . in all the cells we observed _PROTEIN_ was localized on small punctate structures of various size that show dynamic motion . in the division zone of roots many dot like _PROTEIN_ containing compartments were seen in the cytoplasm especially near the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in the differentiation zone _METHOD_ signals near the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were reduced and distinct signals appeared along lines . these aligned signals are the _METHOD_ trajectories of high speed movement of _PROTEIN_ containing vesicles along the actin _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ also accumulated on cell plates in dividing cells and in the tip region of growing root hair cells . similar localization patterns were observed in cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . transgenic plants co _PROTEIN_ venus _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ revealed that each pair of proteins co localize in the division zone of roots . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ pair was used as a positive control of co localization . we also performed quantitative analysis of the co localization using a macro written in metamorph software which semi automatically measures the distance from the center of each _METHOD_ signal to the center of the nearest _METHOD_ or venus signal in acquired images . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were not detected in root tips because their _PROTEIN_ is spatially restricted to the stele and root hair cells respectively . hereafter we refer to the compartment labeled by _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ as the _PROTEIN_ compartment . next the _PROTEIN_ compartment was tested for the presence of known organelle markers of post _LOCATION_ traffic by high resolution confocal laser microscopy . as shown in figure the _PROTEIN_ compartment showed partial association with organelles labeled by _METHOD_ tagged syntaxin of plants _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ tagged _LOCATION_ proton _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and less with sialyl transferase fused _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ tagged arabidopsis rab _PROTEIN_ homolog _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ tagged arabidopsis rab _PROTEIN_ homolog _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . however the co localization with _PROTEIN_ r soluble n ethyl maleimide sensitive _PROTEIN_ attachment protein receptor which is another key regulator of _LOCATION_ traffic was remarkable . the comparison of the _PROTEIN_ compartment with the tgn was interesting because they seemed to be frequently adjacent and sometimes associated . however this association appeared to be not as tight and stable as that of the _LOCATION_ and the tgn . we sometimes observed the _PROTEIN_ compartment adjacent to the _PROTEIN_ compartment but rarely adjacent to the _PROTEIN_ compartment . quantitative analysis of the co localization clarified the tendency of the markers to co localize with or be adjacent to the _PROTEIN_ compartment . to characterize the _PROTEIN_ compartment in more detail we examined whether inhibitors of post _LOCATION_ traffic affect the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ pattern . brefeldin a inhibits budding of vesicles and aggregates _LOCATION_ and post _LOCATION_ compartments such as the tgn and endosomes . the _PROTEIN_ compartment also aggregated upon bfa treatment although some _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signals remained on large bead like structures . wortmannin an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol kinase _PROTEIN_ exaggerates the different characteristics of the _PROTEIN_ compartment and the tgn . wortmannin caused no morphological change to the tgn labeled by _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . however _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signals increased on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ upon wortmannin treatment while dot like signals of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the cytoplasm _PROTEIN_ . treatment with dimethylsulfoxide _METHOD_ had no effect on these compartments . these results indicate that the _PROTEIN_ compartment has a property that is different from the tgn represented by _PROTEIN_ and that shows a tendency to associate with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ upon wortmannin treatment . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are r snare proteins that operate redundantly in the secretory pathway . double staining of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ revealed that the two proteins largely co localize on punctate structures . most _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signals were accompanied by _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ but some _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signals were not associated with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ also co localized with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ showed similar responses to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ upon treatment with wortmannin and bfa . thus the _PROTEIN_ compartment appeared to be closely related to the compartment to which _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ localize suggesting a role for _PROTEIN_ in transport toward the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to examine the involvement of _PROTEIN_ in transport between the tgn and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ we generated transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ a mutant form of _PROTEIN_ either _PROTEIN_ fixed _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or gdp fixed _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ fixed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are constitutively active and are thought to accumulate on the target _LOCATION_ . however gdp fixed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ act in a dominant negative way by trapping the guanine nucleotide exchange _PROTEIN_ . significant localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was observed in root tip cells in addition to the punctate structures . such relocation was not evident in differentiated cells . the punctate structures of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ co localized with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ almost completely and also overlapped well with the tgn labeled by _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and vha _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ showed increased _LOCATION_ labeling compared to the wild type . in contrast to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was localized to larger punctate structures . these structures co localized well with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ suggesting recolation of _PROTEIN_ to multi vesicular endosomes . interestingly the size of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ compartments appeared larger than in the control when co _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the co localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and the localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ support the idea that _PROTEIN_ may function in transport from the tgn to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to test whether _PROTEIN_ plays any role in endocytosis we examined the effect of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ on the uptake of a lipophilic dye used to trace endocytosis . as shown in figure no significant difference was observed in the kinetics of internalization . as shown in figure which was taken with a long exposure time localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ appeared to occur along distinct lines . to increase the time resolution we applied variable incidence angle _METHOD_ microscopy a technique that is related to total internal reflection _METHOD_ microscopy _PROTEIN_ which has a high signal to noise ratio and can take pictures at frames per sec . high speed movies clearly showed that these aligned signals were the _METHOD_ trajectories of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ containing vesicles moving along filamentous structures . to reveal the nature of these structures we studied transgenic plants co _PROTEIN_ lifeact venus _LOCATION_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the results indicated that vesicles labeled by _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ form queues along actin filaments . such aligned signals were dispersed when actin filaments were depolymerized by latrunculin b . no apparent change was observed in response to treatment with oryzalin a microtubule depolymerization agent . thus the dynamic motion of _PROTEIN_ vesicles is actin dependent . all pieces of evidence obtained so far suggest that the major function of _PROTEIN_ is in the secretory pathway at the transport step from the tgn to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to further understand possible physiological roles of _PROTEIN_ members we obtained four t dna inserted mutant lines which were completely knocked out for _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . single mutants showed no macroscopically abnormal phenotypes . we therefore constructed multiple mutated plants by cross pollination . the quadruple mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ exhibited only a marginal phenotype under ordinary growth conditions with slightly shorter roots than the wild type . transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the dominant negative _PROTEIN_ mutant showed a more prominent growth defect than the quadruple mutant suggesting that other _PROTEIN_ members support loss of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but are dominantly impaired by _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . next we focused on stress tolerance and investigated the phenotypes of the quadruple mutants and the plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under biotic or abiotic stress . we found that these plants exhibited prominent phenotypes when subjected to salinity stress . interestingly the quadruple mutant showed a very severe growth defect under salinity stress conditions . on one tenth strength _METHOD_ medium containing mm nacl the majority of the quadruple mutants died during the cotyledon stage . the fresh weights of the quadruple mutant were fivefold lower than those of the wild type plants on average . this salt hypersensitivity of the quadruple mutant was complemented by venus _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were also hypersensitive to salinity stress . neither the quadruple knockout mutation nor _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ affected growth sensitivity to mm sorbitol indicating that the hypersensitivity was not due to high osmolarity but to the high salt concentration . taken together these results show that at least four members of the _PROTEIN_ group _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ act redundantly in tolerance to salinity stress .
