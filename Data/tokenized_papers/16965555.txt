we have used reverse genetic analysis to investigate the function of and a pair of closely related arabidopsis thaliana genes that encode protein kinases . plants homozygous for either or displayed no apparent mutant phenotype whereas the double mutant combination caused pollen lethality . transmission of the double mutant combination through the female gametophyte was normal . tetrad analysis performed using the arabidopsis quartet mutation demonstrated that the pollen lethal phenotype segregated at meiosis with the genotype . we used transmission electron microscopy to determine that double mutant pollen grains develop _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ irregularities following pollen mitosis i . analysis of the subcellular localization of a yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion protein using confocal microscopy and biochemical fractionation indicated that a substantial portion of the present in arabidopsis cells is localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . taken together our results suggest that is required for the normal functioning of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in developing arabidopsis pollen .
insertional mutations within and were obtained from the salk institute 's collection of t dna transformed arabidopsis lines . we used dna sequencing to determine the precise locations of the t dna insertions in the mutant lines . in the t dna was located in exon in the t dna was located in the intron between exon and exon . reverse transcriptase pcr was used to determine the effect that these t dna insertions had on the messenger rna levels of these two genes . total rna from plants homozygous for either or was analyzed using primers that amplify a region of the wild type transcript that spans the location of the t dna insertion in each gene . messenger rna was detected in wild type columbia plants for both genes . by contrast no message was detected in the homozygous plants and no message was detected in the homozygotes . these results indicated that no full length transcript is produced in these t dna lines . to further characterize and we also performed quantitative real time rt pcr using primer pairs located downstream of each t dna insertion site . using these primers we detected a truncated message in plants at a level about fold lower than that of the full length message made by wild type plants . no detectable downstream rna was produced in the plants suggesting that constitutes a null allele . we have observed in our studies of other salk t dna lines that the left border region often has the capacity to serve as a promoter driving _PROTEIN_ of downstream sequences . the genetic analysis that we report _PROTEIN_ in this study provides conclusive evidence that the double mutant combination causes pollen lethality . this result indicates that the mutation severely compromises the function of the gene . because an ectopic copy of the wild type is able to rescue this pollen lethality constitutes a recessive loss of function allele . we did not observe any abnormal phenotypes in plants homozygous for either or when grown under standard laboratory conditions . in addition each of these mutant alleles displayed a normal mendelian segregation ratio . as and are closely related genes it seemed likely that functional redundancy could be masking the appearance of a mutant phenotype in these homozygous lines . therefore and plants were crossed to create double mutants . one of the resulting double heterozygous lines was then allowed to self fertilize and more than individuals from the resulting population were genotyped using pcr . no homozygous double mutants were found . however plants homozygous mutant at one locus and heterozygous at the other were found . one such plant with the genotype was allowed to self pollinate and although we genotyped of its progeny we still failed to recover any homozygous double mutants . in addition the segregation ratio displayed by the mutation in this population was suggesting that a gametophyte lethal mutation was segregating . genotypes of progeny progeny and progeny were determined by pcr . dpercentage of total progeny . we next performed reciprocal crosses between a plant and a wild type columbia plant to test for gametophytic defects . progeny from the reciprocal crosses were genotyped by pcr to test for transmission of the mutant allele . it was determined that the combination could not be transmitted through pollen . transmission through the female gametophyte was normal . reciprocal crosses were performed between wild type and parents . the genotypes of progeny from these crosses were determined by pcr and used to infer the genotype of the gamete contributed by the mutant parent in each cross . athe number in parentheses indicates the percentage of gametes with the given genotype . we used genetic complementation to confirm that the inability of to be transmitted by pollen was due to mutation of the genes . an approximately kb fragment of genomic dna encompassing the wild type locus was pcr amplified cloned into a binary vector and introduced into plants via agrobacterium mediated transformation . progeny of the primary transformants were screened by pcr to identify plants that were homozygous double mutant at the native and loci . for this analysis we made use of pcr primers that can distinguish the endogenous locus from the introduced copy of . using this strategy we were able to generate plants only when the lines also carried an ectopic copy of . controls transformed using the binary vector alone did not yield any homozygous double mutant progeny . these results indicated that the segregating mutation responsible for pollen lethality is . the pollen lethality caused by is only observed in plants that are also homozygous for presumably due to functional redundancy . in order to further confirm these molecular complementation results we performed genetic analysis of plants that were hemizygous for an ectopic copy of by performing reciprocal crosses between these plants and wild type columbia . as the t dna vector used to introduce the ectopic copy of also encodes resistance to the herbicide basta transmission of the ectopic construct was measured by plating the progeny of these crosses onto growth media containing basta . when plants segregating the ectopic construct were used as the pollen donor of the progeny were basta resistant indicating that the locus is required for pollen function . by contrast when plants segregating the ectopic construct were fertilized with wild type pollen about of the progeny were basta sensitive and about were basta resistant confirming that the locus is not essential for the function of the female gametophyte . reciprocal crosses were performed between wild type and rescued mutant lines _PROTEIN_ . transmission of the ectopic copy of was monitored by scoring resistance of the seedlings to the herbicide basta . the rescued mutant line was used as either the female or male parent in the crosses . cthe number in parentheses indicates the percentage of progeny in the given category . the genetic analyses described above indicated that the combination can not be transmitted through the male gamete . failure to transmit mutant alleles through the pollen can be caused by defects in pollen viability germination pollen tube growth or fertilization . in order to decide between these possibilities we began by testing for pollen viability using alexander 's staining . mature pollen grains from wild type plants appear as full round red stained grains when treated with alexander 's stain . as seen in figure pollen isolated from and plants was composed of a mixture of viable and dead pollen suggesting that the double mutant combination may cause pollen lethality . in order to determine whether a mutation segregating at meiosis was responsible for this pollen lethality we made use of the arabidopsis quartet mutation . plants homozygous for the quartet mutation produce pollen in which the four products of meiosis remain physically stuck together resulting in quartets of pollen grains . by segregating a mutation in the quartet background it is possible to examine the four products of meiosis . we therefore crossed a plant to a _PROTEIN_ plant and selected progeny in subsequent generations by genotype at the and loci and by phenotype at the qrt locus . when the quartets of pollen produced by a _PROTEIN_ plant were analyzed by alexander 's staining we always observed two viable pollen grains and two dead pollen grains . by contrast pollen from a _PROTEIN_ plant always produced quartets in which all four pollen grains were viable . these data in conjunction with the additional genetic analyses described above indicated that segregation of the mutation at meiosis was responsible for the pollen lethality observed in _PROTEIN_ plants . as shown earlier the pollen lethality of is dependent on the presence of the mutation . in order to determine the developmental stage at which pollen lethality occurred we observed pollen isolated from _PROTEIN_ plants at various stages of floral development . by using the quartet background we were able to directly compare wild type and mutant pollen derived from the same microsporocyte . pollen was isolated from flowers ranging from stage to stage where stage corresponds to the first opened flower . lower numbers represent flower buds before the opened stage and higher numbers indicate flowers after the opened stage . the _METHOD_ stain diamidino phenylindole is an effective method of monitoring the _LOCATION_ of pollen because of the stain 's preference for binding to _LOCATION_ acids . at flower stage the quartet of microspores has completed meiosis and a single _LOCATION_ can be seen in each of the four members of the quartet . no differences can be seen between the four pollen grains at this stage suggesting that the double mutant combination does not affect meiosis or early pollen development . pollen from stage flowers is expected to have completed the second mitotic division . each wild type pollen grain should therefore contain two sperm _LOCATION_ and one vegetative _LOCATION_ . when stained with dapi sperm _LOCATION_ appear as compact bright spots of blue while the vegetative _LOCATION_ appears as a diffuse patch of blue which is sometimes difficult to observe . we often observed that three of the four pollen grains from stage flowers contained two sperm _LOCATION_ while the fourth grain contained only one . these results indicated that one of the mutant pollen grains was able to proceed through pollen mitosis ii while the other appeared to have stopped development sometime between pollen mitosis i and ii . when dapi staining was performed on quartets of mature pollen we always observed two normal wild type pollen grains and two dead pollen grains with no visible dapi staining . these observations are consistent with the results we obtained using alexander 's stain . our analysis of the dapi staining pattern of pollen from various developmental stages indicated that pollen lethality occurs after the completion of pollen mitosis i and in many cases not until after the completion of pollen mitosis ii . pollen isolated from _PROTEIN_ plants gave the same results when analyzed by dapi staining . in order to better understand the phenotype of the double mutant pollen we attempted to identify the first structural defects that arise during the course of pollen development . based on our preliminary analysis using dapi staining we focused these studies on the stages of development between pollen mitosis i and pollen mitosis ii . transmission electron microscope analysis of large numbers of pollen grains collected from anthers revealed that mutant phenotypes were detectable only following the completion of pollen mitosis i . two distinct classes of mutant pollen were observed and examples of each are shown in figure . class i mutant pollen has three characteristic features irregularity of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ a _PROTEIN_ intine layer and degenerating mitochondria . a representative class i mutant is shown in figure . the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of these pollen grains have an irregular shape when compared with wild type and feature unusual invaginations that protrude into the cytoplasm . in addition the intine layer of the mutants appears _PROTEIN_ than wild type . the intine layers of three representative wild type and mutant pollen grains were measured at positions around the perimeter of each pollen grain in order to determine the average intine _PROTEIN_ . the average intine _PROTEIN_ was nm for wild type and nm for the class i mutant . the final characteristic of class i mutant pollen is mitochondrial degeneration . compared to wild type mitochondria mitochondria in class i mutants are swollen with a lightly stained _PROTEIN_ and reduced cristae . despite these abnormalities however class i mutant pollen contains an intact generative cell suggesting that pollen mitosis i has completed normally in these mutants . class ii mutant pollen has three characteristic features _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ irregularity a _PROTEIN_ intine layer and unusual _LOCATION_ like structures . these first two characteristics are shared with class i mutants . the unique features of class ii mutants are that they have normal mitochondria but abnormal _LOCATION_ like structures . these _LOCATION_ like structures are not found in wild type pollen at this stage of development . representative class ii mutant pollen grains are shown in figure . despite the abnormal _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ present in this pollen class ii mutants are able to complete pollen mitosis ii as indicated by the presence of the two sperm cells in the cytoplasm of the vegetative cell . these sperm cells appeared to have a normal structure and organization suggesting that the mutations do not directly affect mitosis or cell division . instead the _PROTEIN_ effects appear to be a disruption of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ of the intine and the appearance of unusual _LOCATION_ like structures . transmission electron microscope analysis of mature pollen collected from anthers revealed that about of the pollen population was fully collapsed with full degradation of cellular structures . these observations indicated that the two distinct classes of mutant pollen share the same fate and are indistinguishable at the mature pollen stage . the analysis described above indicated that class ii mutant pollen grains develop unusual structures that have the appearance of _LOCATION_ when viewed using tem . in order to determine whether these unusual structures were indeed _LOCATION_ we made use of neutral red which serves as a _LOCATION_ specific _METHOD_ dye . neutral red has been shown to accumulate in _LOCATION_ and vesicles and its _METHOD_ is affected by the ph of the _LOCATION_ . by choosing appropriate excitation and emission filters neutral red specific _METHOD_ of _LOCATION_ can be detected in pollen using confocal microscopy . pollen grains were collected from the flowers of a _PROTEIN_ plant at the stage in development where the unusual _LOCATION_ like structures appear in class ii mutants . this developmental stage is the same as that used for the tem experiments displayed in figure . at this stage of development wild type pollen does not contain any large _LOCATION_ structures . by using the quartet background for this experiment we were able to directly compare wild type pollen grains and mutant pollen grains in the same tetrad . as a control pollen from a _PROTEIN_ plant was also analyzed . in this case all four members of the quartet should display a wild type phenotype . as seen in figure the four wild type pollen grains show only a low level of _LOCATION_ specific neutral red _METHOD_ . the merged image in the lower panel overlays the _LOCATION_ specific _METHOD_ collected in the red channel with cell wall _METHOD_ collected in the green channel . cell wall _METHOD_ was used to demarcate the positions of the four members of the tetrad . when pollen from a _PROTEIN_ plant was analyzed using this same procedure it was often observed that one of the mutant pollen grains present in the quartet displayed strong _LOCATION_ specific neutral red _METHOD_ . this result suggests that the large _LOCATION_ like structures observed via tem in the class ii mutants are indeed _LOCATION_ as opposed to other cellular structures . because class i and class ii mutant pollen grains occur with approximately equal frequency and only the class ii mutants show the large _LOCATION_ structures under tem analysis it is expected that only about of the mutant pollen grains should generate _LOCATION_ specific _METHOD_ . consistent with this prediction our analysis of several dozen quartets indicated that only one of the mutant pollen grains in a given quartet displayed strong _LOCATION_ specific neutral red _METHOD_ . the tem analysis described above indicated that one of the phenotypic consequences of mutating and was a disruption of the normal functioning of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in order to better understand how directly and might affect the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ we analyzed the subcellular localization of . to accomplish this goal we constructed a binary vector encoding an n terminal translational fusion between and the _METHOD_ under the transcriptional control of the native promoter . this construct was stably introduced into plants via agrobacterium transformation . progeny from the primary transformants were screened by pcr to identify homozygous double mutant plants . using this strategy we were able to generate plants only when the lines also carried an ectopic copy of the _METHOD_ construct indicating that the fusion protein was functional because of its ability to rescue the pollen lethal phenotype . thirty independent transgenic lines were screened for the presence of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . twenty five of the lines _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ fusion protein at a high enough level to be detected by _METHOD_ microscopy . analysis of young seedlings revealed that _METHOD_ was most highly _PROTEIN_ in newly emerging leaves and near the root tip . all transgenic lines displayed a similar _PROTEIN_ pattern . these observations are consistent with previous reports that is most highly _PROTEIN_ in tissues containing dividing cells . we attempted to visualize _METHOD_ in pollen but were not able to reproducibly observe a _METHOD_ signal which is likely to be due to the high level of _METHOD_ displayed by the pollen cell wall . in order to determine the subcellular localization of we used confocal microscopy to observe the cells of young leaves of arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . this tissue was chosen because it displayed the highest level of _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ . the confocal microscope settings used for these experiments resulted in no _METHOD_ when the cells of untransformed wild type plants were observed for _METHOD_ excitation/emission . the merged confocal images collected from two representative young leaves _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are shown in figure . a majority of the _METHOD_ signal present in these images is located at the periphery of the cell . a low level of _METHOD_ was seen in the cytoplasm but none was detected in the _LOCATION_ . for comparison a merged confocal image of a similar young leaf from a _METHOD_ control plant is shown in figure . the _METHOD_ signal in the _METHOD_ plants is observed throughout the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ . _METHOD_ associated with the cell perimeter could be due to _METHOD_ localization to the cell wall the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or both . to distinguish between these possibilities we performed plasmolysis experiments using plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signal in these plants localized with the displaced _LOCATION_ in plasmolysed cells indicating that the peripheral localization of _METHOD_ corresponds to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ rather than the cell wall . the confocal microscopy results described above suggested that may be associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in order to further investigate this possibility we performed a biochemical fractionation experiment to separate cellular proteins into _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ fractions . preliminary experiments revealed that the native promoter was not able to generate a level of protein _PROTEIN_ that was high enough to be detectable in the fractionation assay . in order to overcome this problem we constructed an _PROTEIN_ vector in which the _METHOD_ fusion construct was under the transcriptional control of an alcohol inducible promoter and used this construct to generate transgenic arabidopsis lines . using this ethanol inducible system we were able to generate a level of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ that was sufficient for detection in the fractionation assay . three different arabidopsis lines were used in the fractionation experiment wild type columbia a _METHOD_ control line and plants _PROTEIN_ the ethanol inducible _METHOD_ . three days prior to protein extraction the ethanol inducible _METHOD_ plants were watered with ethanol to induce _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . tissue was harvested from leaf and inflorescence tissues of soil grown plants and protein extracts were separated into post _LOCATION_ supernatant _LOCATION_ free _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ free microsomal _LOCATION_ fractions by high speed centrifugation . in order to verify the success of the fractionation immunoblotting was performed with antibodies that recognize well characterized _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ associated proteins . an antibody against the plant ubx domain containing protein was used as the _LOCATION_ marker and an antibody against syntaxin _PROTEIN_ was the _LOCATION_ compartment marker . these controls confirmed the identity and purity of each subcellular fraction . we next attempted to visualize _METHOD_ by immunoblotting with an anti _METHOD_ antibody but were not able to detect this fusion protein by western blot analysis . this difficultly could be related to the relatively large size of the protein . we therefore chose to use an alternative method for quantifying the abundance of _METHOD_ in each of the protein fractions . for this analysis a _METHOD_ plate reader was used to measure the amount of _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ _METHOD_ present in each sample . this approach is analogous to the well established practice of using enzyme activities to follow specific proteins through biochemical fractionation experiments . in our case the activity that we were measuring was _METHOD_ _METHOD_ rather than an enzymatic reaction . this activity is highly specific for the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ proteins present in our samples as demonstrated by the low level of background _METHOD_ detected in the wild type columbia controls . the optimum combination of excitation wavelength emission wavelength and cutoff filter settings were used for _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the _METHOD_ samples and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the _METHOD_ samples . in each case wild type columbia samples were also analyzed using the same parameters in order to determine the level of background _METHOD_ for each combination of filter settings . as shown in figure the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ protein extracts produced _METHOD_ signals that were well above the background level observed in wild type columbia . the relative _METHOD_ units shown in these graphs are normalized to a buffer only control . the data presented in figure indicate that the _METHOD_ protein is more abundant in the _LOCATION_ fraction than it is in the _LOCATION_ fraction . for comparison figure presents the results obtained with protein extracted from the _METHOD_ plants . in this case the majority of the _METHOD_ protein was observed in the _LOCATION_ fraction . this result is consistent with the _PROTEIN_ that _METHOD_ is a soluble protein that is known to be distributed throughout the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ of plant cells . taken together these results indicate that a significant portion of the _METHOD_ protein present in arabidopsis cells is associated with the _LOCATION_ compartment . the _METHOD_ readings in figure were collected from samples that had been adjusted to contain equal amounts of total protein . the and samples were all adjusted to mg of total protein prior to analysis using the plate reader . this normalization strategy explains why the amount of _METHOD_ signal observed in a subcellular fraction is higher than the amount of signal present in the corresponding sample prior to fractionation .
arabidopsis plants carrying t dna insertions within and were obtained from the salk institute genomic analysis laboratory . the following pcr primers were used to genotype plants carrying these t dna insertions . f cactctggactatggacgggaaactcaag r acccaaggacattacaggttcagtggatg f ttatgacttttgagcgcagatgctaggag r tcagaagcagcacaaactcctgacaattc t dna left border caaactggaacaacactcaaccctatctc . dna sequencing of the genomic dna flanking the t dna insertion sites confirmed the identity of each gene and the precise locations of the t dna insertions . all of the t dna mutants and wild type plants in this study were from the columbia ecotype col . ribonucleic acid was isolated from plants plants and wild type plants using the qiagen rneasy plant mini kit . real time quantitative rt pcr was carried out using the quantitect sybr green rt pcr kit with as a control . polymerase chain reaction primers specific to the predicted cdna sequences of each gene were used for this analysis rt

out on an icycler iqtm real time pcr detection system . the pcr primers ccgtgttcaccaccaaagacattg and ctgaccacttttcctctatgcatc were used to amplify an bp long fragment of genomic dna that included the entire coding region plus about kb of upstream sequences and about kb of downstream sequences . this pcr product was ligated into a spectinomycin resistant derivative of . the resulting binary vector containing the gene was introduced into plants using agrobacterium mediated transformation . transformed plants were selected in soil in the next generation by spraying seedlings with the herbicide basta . in order to create the _METHOD_ fusion construct the wild type genomic clone described above was modified using site directed mutagenesis in order to add two restriction sites immediately after the start codon . recognitions sites for the enzymes avrii and agei were introduced . the _METHOD_ coding sequence was then pcr amplified from a plasmid vector using pcr primers that added a nhei site to the end of the cds and an agei site to the end . this pcr amplified fragment containing the _METHOD_ cds was then ligated into the modified clone using sticky ends generated by avrii agei and nhei cleavage . nhei sticky ends are identical to those produced by avrii . the resulting construct contains the _METHOD_ cds fused in frame to the end of the coding region . the resulting plasmid was introduced into _PROTEIN_ plants using agrobacterium mediated transformation as described above . in order to construct the ethanol inducible version of the _METHOD_ fusion protein the _METHOD_ coding region described above was moved into the binary vector developed by citation that carries an ethanol inducible promoter system and the vector was introduced into arabidopsis plants via agrobacterium mediated transformation . to monitor pollen viability pollen was collected by squashing anthers containing mature pollen onto microscope slides . alexander 's staining solution was added and pollen grains were viewed with bright field illumination . to visualize pollen _LOCATION_ pollen was applied to a microscope slide stained with mm dapi solution covered with a cover slip and viewed with a uv light . whole developing anthers were removed from flower buds and immediately loaded into sample holders filled with m sucrose . the samples were frozen in a baltec hpm high pressure freezer and transferred into liquid nitrogen for storage . substitution and sample embedding were performed as described in citation . thin sections were cut with a reichert jung ultracut model e microtome and images were collected using a philips _PROTEIN_ scanning transmission electron microscope . live cell imaging transgenic plants was performed on day old seedlings grown on agarose media containing murashige and skoog salt mixture or young leaves isolated from soil grown plants . confocal imaging was performed with a zeiss axiovert m inverted microscope equipped with bio rad laser scanning . for higher magnification a high numerical aperture oil immersion objective was employed . a nm or a nm laser line from an argon ion laser was used to excite _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ while the _METHOD_ emission was collected by a broad band pass filter . for neutral red staining pollen grains were soaked in neutral red for min . to detect _METHOD_ a nm laser band was used for excitation and emission was split by the use of a nm filter to detect pollen cell wall _METHOD_ and a nm filter to detect _LOCATION_ specific neutral red _METHOD_ . soluble and _LOCATION_ fractions were prepared from week old soil grown arabidopsis plants . whole plants not including root tissue were ground with liquid nitrogen and suspended in modified mib buffer . a post _LOCATION_ supernatant designated as was prepared by centrifugation at g for min at . microsomal _LOCATION_ were prepared by centrifugation of the at g in a rotor for min at . the supernatant was transferred to a new tube and the pellet was resuspended in the modified mib buffer described above using a glass dounce homogenizer . aliquots were made of each fraction snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at . the protein content of each fraction was determined using the bio rad dc protein assay kit and bsa as a standard . to verify the success of protein fractionation and fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting using _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ antibody . before immunoblotting the _LOCATION_ was analyzed by ponceaus staining to confirm protein recovery and equal loading . to induce _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants were watered with ethanol every days . leaf and inflorescence tissue from week old soil grown wild type plants plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and plants _PROTEIN_ ethanol inducible _METHOD_ was collected and protein samples were fractionated as described above to generate and samples . the protein concentration of each sample following fractionation was adjusted to approximately mg . fifty microliters of each adjusted sample was then loaded into fluoronunctm/luminunctm well polystyrene plates and the _METHOD_ of each fraction was detected by the spectramax gemini microplate spectrofluorometer . for reading _METHOD_
