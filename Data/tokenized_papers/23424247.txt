plant clathrin mediated _LOCATION_ trafficking is involved in many developmental processes as well as in responses to environmental cues . previous studies have shown that clathrin mediated endocytosis of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ auxin transporter _PROTEIN_ is regulated by the _LOCATION_ auxin receptor auxin binding _PROTEIN_ . however the _METHOD_ by which _PROTEIN_ and other _PROTEIN_ regulate clathrin mediated trafficking are poorly understood . here we applied a genetic strategy and time resolved imaging to dissect the role of clathrin light chains and _PROTEIN_ in auxin regulation of clathrin mediated trafficking in arabidopsis thaliana . auxin was found to differentially regulate the pm and trans _LOCATION_ network/early endosome association of clcs and heavy chains in an _PROTEIN_ dependent but transport inhibitor binding f box protein _PROTEIN_ independent manner . loss of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ affected chc _LOCATION_ association _PROTEIN_ both internalization and intracellular trafficking of pm proteins and impaired auxin regulated endocytosis . consistent with these results basipetal auxin transport auxin sensitivity and distribution and root gravitropism were also found to be dramatically altered in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants resulting in pleiotropic defects in plant development . these results suggest that clcs are key regulators in clathrin mediated trafficking downstream of _PROTEIN_ mediated signaling and thus play a critical role in _LOCATION_ trafficking from the tgn/ee and pm during plant development .
bioinformatic analyses have identified two chc and three clc genes in the arabidopsis thaliana genome . share amino acid identity with each other and identity with either mammalian _PROTEIN_ or clcb _METHOD_ . previous studies have demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ localizes to the tgn/ee and to dynamic pm associated foci and upon auxin treatment the levels of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transiently disappear from the pm but remain constant at the tgn/ee . to further assess the regulation and role of clcs in auxin dependent cme we first reevaluated the effects of auxin on the localization and _LOCATION_ association of clcs . five day old seedlings that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under control of its native promoter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were treated with exogenous auxin dichlorophenoxyacetic acid for different lengths of time and the levels of pm and tgn/ee associated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy _PROTEIN_ . as previously reported the levels of pm associated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in root epidermal cells transiently _PROTEIN_ after treatment with auxin for min and reappeared at the pm after to min . no significant changes in the levels of pm associated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were detected in the different time mock controls . however in contrast with the results of citation the association of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with the tgn/ee paralleled the auxin stimulated loss followed by recovery of the pm pool of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . similarly analyses of the subcellular distribution of endogenous in wild type root epidermal cells by _METHOD_ microscopy using affinity purified anti specific antibodies and live cell imaging of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ under control of the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus promoter showed that the pm and tgn/ee association of the isoform was also regulated by exogenous auxin . furthermore the levels of pm and tgn/ee associated endogenous and the _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins displayed similar kinetic profiles in _METHOD_ of their transient loss after to min and subsequent recovery after min in response to exogenous auxin treatment . in yeast and animal cells clcs and chcs assemble to form clathrin triskelia in vivo . therefore we tested the effects of auxin on the levels of _LOCATION_ associated chcs by if microscopy using affinity purified anti chc specific antibodies . surprisingly in contrast with clcs the levels of pm and tgn/ee associated chcs appeared to initially increase after auxin treatments for and min . the intensity of the chc signal at the pm and tgn/ee increased by relative to the mock controls . however after min the levels of pm and tgn/ee associated chcs were found to significantly _PROTEIN_ in auxin treated seedlings . immunoblot analysis of microsomal _LOCATION_ fractions from the whole wild type seedlings in the presence or absence of exogenous auxin confirmed that the levels of _LOCATION_ associated and _PROTEIN_ initially _PROTEIN_ whereas chc levels increased min after d addition relative to those in mock treated seedlings . subsequently the levels of _LOCATION_ associated and _PROTEIN_ returned to wild type levels whereas chc levels _PROTEIN_ min after d addition consistent with _PROTEIN_ analysis of clc and chc subcellular localization in root epidermal cells . the differential effects of the auxin d on the levels of pm and tgn/ee associated chcs and _METHOD_ were shown to be coordinated within individual cells _PROTEIN_ endogenous chcs and _METHOD_ . d is a synthetic auxin and we therefore examined the effects of natural and other synthetic auxin analogs on the pm and tgn/ee association of clathrin subunits . similar to the effects of d naphthalene acetic acid and the natural auxin indole acetic acid were found to differentially affect the pm and tgn/ee association of and chcs . conversely a structural analog of naa naphthalene acetic acid which has no biological auxin activity and fluoroindole acetic acid which promotes auxin dependent gene transcription but does not inhibit _PROTEIN_ internalization had no affect on the subcellular distribution of _METHOD_ and chcs . these data further support our finding that auxin differentially regulates _LOCATION_ association of clcs and chcs in plants . based upon our analysis of the effects of d on the pm and tgn/ee associated _METHOD_ levels which is _PROTEIN_ under the auxin independent transcriptional control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter and the lack of any effect by f iaa we hypothesized that the initial auxin dependent changes in the clc and chc _LOCATION_ association would be mediated through posttranscriptional processes . indeed using quantitative real time rt pcr analysis we detected no significant differences between the levels of clcs and chcs mrna in mock treated versus d treated seedlings for and min . similarly the effects of auxin on the initial changes in clc and chc association with the pm and tgn/ee were not blocked by cycloheximide a de novo protein synthesis inhibitor or an inhibitor of proteasome mediated protein degradation as demonstrated by _PROTEIN_ analysis of root epidermal cells and by immunoblot analysis of _LOCATION_ fractions from mock and d treated seedlings for min . as shown by _PROTEIN_ imaging chx or alone treatment for min did not significantly affect the levels of pm and tgn/ee associated _METHOD_ and chcs . however de novo protein synthesis was required for the observed restoration following the transient auxin stimulated reduction of _LOCATION_ associated clc levels . as shown in supplemental figure online chx but not inhibited the reappearance of _METHOD_ at the pm and tgn/ee in the presence of d and was restored to wild type levels upon chx washout . similarly immunoblot analysis showed that the levels of _LOCATION_ associated and _PROTEIN_ were reduced in seedlings treated with chx and d but not with and d relative to seedlings treated solely with d for min . conversely as shown by _PROTEIN_ imaging and immunoblot analysis but not chx inhibited the loss of pm and tgn/ee associated chcs after min treatments with d suggesting that auxin mediated loss of _LOCATION_ associated chcs is dependent on proteasome mediated protein degradation . as shown by _PROTEIN_ imaging chx treatment but not alone for min slightly but significantly _PROTEIN_ the levels of pm and tgn/ee associated _METHOD_ and chcs . to determine whether the differential auxin regulated pm and tgn/ee association of clcs and chcs is dependent upon _PROTEIN_ and/or ubiquitin ligase we examined the kinetics of auxin effects on clc and chc _LOCATION_ localization in various auxin signaling mutants by if microscopy and immunoblot analysis . as in the wild type auxin differentially regulated the pm and tgn/ee association of and chcs in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a _LOCATION_ localized auxin receptor quadruple mutant . similar results were observed in _PROTEIN_ a ubiquitin activating enzyme mutant and _PROTEIN_ a scf subunit _PROTEIN_ mutant suggesting that mediated auxin signaling is not directly involved in the differential auxin regulation of clc and chc _LOCATION_ association . as shown in figure the auxin mediated transient depletion and increase in the _LOCATION_ association of and chcs respectively were abolished in _PROTEIN_ mutants that contain an amino acid substitution in the _PROTEIN_ potential auxin binding site and the supposed _PROTEIN_ gain of function _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines . it is likely that the lack of kdel an _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ c terminal tetrapeptide retention signal reduces auxin signaling function of _METHOD_ through disrupting its subcellular localization . in the absence of exogenous auxin the levels of pm and tgn associated and chcs were similar to the wild type in these auxin signaling mutants examined with the exception that increased levels of _LOCATION_ associated and chcs were observed in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines compared with wild type mock controls consistent with the model that in the absence of auxin _PROTEIN_ plays a positive role in endocytosis and potentially clathrin dependent trafficking from the tgn/ee . in addition immunoblot analysis further confirmed that auxin differentially affected the levels of _LOCATION_ associated _PROTEIN_ and chcs in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant seedling _LOCATION_ fractions similarly to in the wild type whereas there was no observed transient _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ or loss of chcs in auxin treated _PROTEIN_ mutants . moreover in the absence of exogenous auxin the levels of _LOCATION_ associated _PROTEIN_ and chcs in axr _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants were similar to those in the wild type . together these results suggest that the differential auxin regulation of clc and chc _LOCATION_ association is dependent on _PROTEIN_ mediated but not _PROTEIN_ mediated auxin signaling . to explore the molecular _METHOD_ underlying the observed differential effects of auxin on the _LOCATION_ association of clcs and chcs we identified mutant lines containing t dna insertions in the three genes encoding and . homozygous mutants could not be obtained as pollen was not viable and their further characterization will be reported elsewhere . in contrast with mutants single homozygous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as well as double homozygous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings were found to be viable . however these mutants displayed numerous developmental defects . as shown in figures to d old _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings have shorter primary roots and longer hypocotyls relative to the wild type . this phenotype was significantly enhanced in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant seedlings relative to either their single mutants or the wild type suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are functionally redundant . in addition week old double mutants exhibited up curled leaves with longer petioles and fewer trichomes relative to the wild type phenotypes that were not observed in the single mutant plants . in the flowering double mutant plants the inflorescence _METHOD_ were more highly branched and prostrate with shorter siliques than the wild type . in addition root hair _PROTEIN_ and the initiation of _PROTEIN_ root primordia were altered in the double mutants . these phenotypes are characteristic of defects in auxin signaling and/or transport and indicate that the loss of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ causes auxin related pleiotropic developmental defects . to confirm that these developmental defects are specific to the t dna insertional mutations in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we generated transgenic homozygous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants that _PROTEIN_ rescue constructs for both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ under control of their native promoters _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . as shown in supplemental figures to online the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ rescue lines displayed phenotypically wild type growth and development with no discernible auxin related defects . to determine whether clcs regulate general cme and/or endocytic trafficking we first analyzed the internalization in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants of _METHOD_ fusions of two pm marker proteins that have distinct functions the auxin efflux transporter _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the rare cold inducible protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which may function in response to abiotic stress . previous studies have demonstrated that the internalization of pyridinium dibromide a lipophilic styryl dye and _PROTEIN_ is dependent on cme and is regulated by . to confirm that internalization of pm localized _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is also clathrin dependent we examined the effects of tyrphostin an inhibitor of cme and its structural analog tyrphostin which does not affect cme on _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ internalization in the presence of the vesicle trafficking inhibitor brefeldin a which induces the clustering of _PROTEIN_ secretory pathway compartments into bfa bodies and thereby inhibits the recycling and/or transport of endocytosed proteins to the pm and/or _LOCATION_ . as shown in supplemental figures to online tyrphostin was found to significantly inhibit the intracellular accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in bfa bodies whereas tyrphostin did not affect _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ internalization . together these results indicate that pm localized _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is internalized via cme . to examine whether cme is affected in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants we assessed the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in bfa bodies and the internalization of . we found that the densities of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labeled bfa bodies and levels of internalized after min in the double mutants were significantly lower than observed in wild type cells indicating impaired cme of pm proteins in the double mutants . however no significant difference in the densities of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labeled bfa bodies was detected between the wild type and the double mutants after bfa treatment for min . one potential reason for the difference between the number of _METHOD_ labeled bfa bodies at the early and _PROTEIN_ time points is that the inhibition of internalization by the loss of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is not complete in the double mutants . due to the observed reduction in pm protein internalization at early time points we expected that the levels of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at the pm would be elevated in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant root cells compared with the wild type . indeed quantitative image analysis of seedling roots treated with chx to block the synthesis of new _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed that the pm levels of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were higher in the double mutants than in the wild type in the absence of exogenous auxin . together these results suggest that internalization of pm proteins is impaired in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants . following internalization pm proteins may be transported to _LOCATION_ for degradation or be recycled back to the pm . previous studies in plants have shown that the accumulation of internalized _METHOD_ fused pm proteins in _LOCATION_ can be visualized in light grown seedlings following their incubation in the dark . the _LOCATION_ accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was significantly reduced in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants relative to the wild type after or h dark treatments . to examine whether the recycling of internalized _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to the pm is also affected in the double mutants we monitored as previously described the loss of internalized _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ from bfa bodies following bfa removal in the presence of chx . as expected the recycling back to the pm of internalized _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was slower in the double mutants than in the wild type . to address the mechanism of the impaired internalization and intracellular trafficking of pm proteins observed in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants we examined whether the loss of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ affected the levels of pm and tgn/ee associated and chcs in the absence of exogenous auxin . as expected the levels of pm and tgn/ee associated chcs but not were significantly reduced in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant cells relative to wild type cells which was further supported by immunoblot analysis . taken together these results suggest that clcs are required for the association of chcs with the pm and tgn/ee necessary for clathrin mediated trafficking . next we examined whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are required for the observed differential auxin regulation of _LOCATION_ associated and chc levels . similar to the wild type was rapidly and transiently depleted from the pm and tgn/ee upon treatment of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants with exogenous auxin indicating that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are not required for auxin regulation of _LOCATION_ association . however in contrast with the wild type chc levels at the pm and tgn/ee were not significantly affected in the auxin treated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings which was supported by immunoblot analysis of chc levels in _LOCATION_ fractions prepared from the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings in the presence or absence of exogenous d . furthermore the qrt pcr analysis showed that the levels of _PROTEIN_ mrna _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings were similar to those in the wild type with or without the application of exogenous auxin . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mediate auxin regulation of chc _LOCATION_ abundance . to address the reciprocal question whether chcs are essential for auxin regulation of _LOCATION_ associated clc levels we examined the auxin effects on clc _LOCATION_ abundance in _PROTEIN_ single mutants which show significant phenotypic alterations in growth and development . in the _PROTEIN_ mutants auxin was found to regulate the levels of pm and tgn/ee associated in the same manner as in the wild type as well as in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ is not required for auxin regulation of _LOCATION_ abundance . as previously described auxin inhibits the endocytosis of _PROTEIN_ proteins as well as other pm localized proteins including _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . to address the role of clcs in auxin inhibition of pm protein internalization we analyzed the uptake of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and endogenous _PROTEIN_ by live cell and if microscopy using affinity purified anti _PROTEIN_ specific antibodies respectively in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants treated with or without auxin . in the absence of exogenous auxin the pm _PROTEIN_ localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ was indistinguishable between the wild type and the double mutants indicating that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are not essential for the establishment and _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the root epidermal cells . bfa treatments in the presence or absence of chx showed no significant difference in the number of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ labeled bfa bodies was observed between the wild type and the double mutants consistent with the previous observation . interestingly in the presence of d the number of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ labeled bfa bodies in the double mutants was significantly higher than that in the wild type reflecting that loss of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ reduces the auxin inhibitory effect on _PROTEIN_ endocytosis . by contrast auxin mediated inhibition of _PROTEIN_ endocytosis was restored to the wild type levels in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ rescue lines . in the absence of bfa but in the presence of chx auxin effectively promoted an elevation in the levels of pm associated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the wild type but not in the double mutants . these results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are essential for auxin regulation of _PROTEIN_ endocytosis . to rule out the possibility that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulation in bfa bodies in the auxin treated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant seedlings is due to the inhibitory effect of high bfa levels on the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ degradation low bfa concentrations were used to examine internalization of pm localized proteins . indeed auxin did not efficiently block internalization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the double mutants in the presence of bfa and chx . together these results suggest that clcs are essential for auxin fine regulation of cme . primary root growth of the heterozygous _PROTEIN_ insertional mutants is resistant to exogenously applied auxin indicating that impairment of _PROTEIN_ mediated auxin signaling _PROTEIN_ auxin sensitivity . our hypothesis based on the data presented above is that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ likely function in _PROTEIN_ mediated auxin signaling . to test this we examined whether _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant root growth would be similarly resistant to exogenous auxin as observed for _PROTEIN_ roots . indeed the double mutant root growth was significantly more resistant to d at the concentrations of and relative to the wild type roots . the growth of plant roots in response to gravity is finely and rapidly tuned via basipetal auxin transport that leads to an asymmetric distribution of auxin across the root tip and _PROTEIN_ plays a pivotal role in this process . thus we predicted that altered _PROTEIN_ trafficking in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants would affect _PROTEIN_ mediated basipetal auxin transport . we thus measured the root basipetal auxin transport in the wild type and the double mutants . as shown in figure the root basipetal transport of tritium labeled iaa was increased by in the double mutants relative to that in the wild type suggesting that clcs play a inhibitory role in the _PROTEIN_ mediated basipetal auxin transport in planta . as root basipetal auxin transport is critical for gravitropism we next examined whether root gravitropic responses and auxin asymmetric distribution were altered in the double mutants . as expected the roots of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant seedlings were defective in the gravitropic response . in addition _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ a reporter for auxin distribution was found to be altered in the gravistimulated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ roots . in contrast with the asymmetric distribution of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in gravistimulated wild type roots the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant roots showed impaired auxin redistribution . together our data demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ participate in the root gravitropism through the regulation of _PROTEIN_ mediated basipetal auxin transport and auxin asymmetric distribution .
