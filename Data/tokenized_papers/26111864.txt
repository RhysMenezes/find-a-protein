establishment of apex _PROTEIN_ . elongation of the pollen tube is a highly coordinated process involving _PROTEIN_ secretion of cell wall and _LOCATION_ materials to the apical region . we investigated changes in the localization of soluble _PROTEIN_ attachment proteins in developing pollen grains and the pollen tube for transgenic arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ pollen specific _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ qa snares _PROTEIN_ fused with the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was firstly detected in the microspore _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ during pollen mitosis ii . although _PROTEIN_ and accumulated throughout the _LOCATION_ in the mature pollen grain _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were highly concentrated in the apical or subapical regions of the elongating pollen tube with slightly different localization patterns whereas _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was uniformly localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of the pollen tube . the apex focused _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was established coincident with formation of a gradient before pollen germination . these results suggest that snares function differentially in the same cells and that at least two distinct _LOCATION_ transport pathways are involved in the pollen development and the pollen tube germination and elongation .
we have previously demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are specifically _PROTEIN_ in pollen grains . in the present study we examined the _PROTEIN_ profiles of these snare molecules during pollen development in further detail . as shown in figs . and _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was first detected at floral stages during which pollen mitosis i occurs . subsequently _PROTEIN_ abruptly vanished at floral stages and and was detected again after floral stage when the pollen grains were matured . in contrast _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was only detected at advanced stages of floral development . to investigate changes in the _PROTEIN_ and the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ during pollen development we observed the _METHOD_ in developing pollen grains of transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fused with green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ under the control of their promoters . in the case of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants oval shaped _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed during mitosis i in the developing pollen grain . _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was abolished completely after pollen mitosis i . subsequently _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was re established in the _LOCATION_ of the mature pollen grain whereas _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was predominantly observed in the subapical region of the pollen tube but not in the _LOCATION_ and the pm of the pollen grain after germination . these _PROTEIN_ patterns were completely consistent with the rt pcr analysis . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ might first function during pollen mitosis i . to determine the subcellular localization of the oval shaped _METHOD_ _METHOD_ we stained uninucleate microspores from _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants with dapi . the _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was merged with the _METHOD_ of dapi indicating that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was localized to the microspore _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in the developing pollen grain . thus _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ might play a role in _LOCATION_ rearrangement before the generative _LOCATION_ and vegetative _LOCATION_ are generated from the microspore _LOCATION_ and before the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of the generative cell is formed . in contrast _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was first detected in the _LOCATION_ of mature pollen grains . oval shaped _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ was never observed during early stages of pollen development . after pollen germination _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was uniformly localized to the pm of the pollen tube . note that the _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ at the pm of the pollen grain was relatively weaker than that in pollen tube . intriguingly _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was predominantly localized to the pm of the pollen grain but after germination the _METHOD_ was not localized to the pm of the pollen tube in contrast to the localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ which suggested that the pm of the pollen tube is structurally distinct from the pm of the pollen grain . we observed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ accumulated in the _LOCATION_ of mature pollen grains . the mature pollen grain contains small _LOCATION_ and these _LOCATION_ are extended into a tubular structure in the pollen tube . similarly pollen specific snares might accumulate in the secretory vesicles in the pollen grains as a _LOCATION_ reservoir for rapid pollen tube elongation . we have previously shown that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localized to the apical region of the pollen tube whereas _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localized to the subapical region of the pollen tube . alternatively _PROTEIN_ is reported to be localized asymmetrically behind the pollen tube apex whereas _PROTEIN_ shows a specific distribution with the highest _METHOD_ labeling observed in more distal of the pm regions behind the apex of growing pollen tubes . this discrepancy might be due to the comparison using two different transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ single _METHOD_ protein . therefore to determine the precise localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the elongating pollen tube we generated transgenic plants that simultaneously coexpress _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in pollen . in hydrated mature pollen grains _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was distributed uniformly throughout the _LOCATION_ . the _METHOD_ patterns of the two proteins seemed to be slightly different in the _LOCATION_ . after pollen germination the _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was established at the apex of the pollen tube however _METHOD_ from the two proteins at the shank of pollen tube was different _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ localized to the pm while _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was dispersed in the _LOCATION_ . in the elongating pollen tube _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were colocalized to the inverted cone of apical vesicles but not at the pollen tube apex . higher _METHOD_ intensity for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ but not _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was observed at the flanks of the subapical pm of the pollen tube and . in fig . we analyzed the colocalization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with . these data showed that the _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ merged with the pm while _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was merged with both the pm and the internal vesicles suggesting that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is more internalized and recycled than _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . from these results we concluded that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ localized to vesicles in _LOCATION_ in the mature pollen grain whereas _PROTEIN_ localized to the pm and vesicles and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ localized to secretory vesicles and in germinated and elongating pollen tube . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are reported to be used in the general secretion pathway whereas are involved in specific secretion pathways such as tip growth of root hair and papillae formation . in root hair cells _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ form snare complexes with r snares _PROTEIN_ and act in a coordinated fashion to mediate tip focused _LOCATION_ trafficking for root hair tip growth . in pollen grains r snares _PROTEIN_ and are specifically _PROTEIN_ . given that a similar tip focused _LOCATION_ trafficking mechanism of root hair is used in pollen tube elongation _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ might form snare complexes with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for tip growth of pollen tube . namely _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function on the recycling pathway in the pollen tube tip while _PROTEIN_ acts in the non _PROTEIN_ secretion to the pm of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . we also found that localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is slightly different in elongating pollen tube . the data suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have distinct function in pollen tube elongation . a loss of function analysis using _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants is needed to clarify the function of these snares . we previously reported that _PROTEIN_ accumulation of _PROTEIN_ on root hair tip is f actin _LOCATION_ dependent . we tested whether the _PROTEIN_ accumulation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is also f actin dependent an actin polymerization inhibitor latrunculin b was treated during pollen tube elongation . after lat b treatment the focal accumulation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the pollen tube tip region was completely disappeared and the tip region of the pollen tubes was abnormally swollen and then the pollen tubes of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants were finally ruptured . thus we concluded that the tip focused accumulation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is also f actin _LOCATION_ dependent . it has been reported that dynamics are important for pollen germination during pollination . we have previously shown that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ show _PROTEIN_ localization to the apical region of the growing pollen tube whereas these proteins are uniformly distributed throughout the _LOCATION_ of mature pollen grains . this observation raises the important question of when the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is established in pollen grains although the relationship between the _PROTEIN_ establishment of pollen snares and dynamics is largely unknown during pollen germination . to examine the relationship between dynamics and establishment of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the pollen grain during pollination we generated transgenic plants simultaneously _PROTEIN_ the calcium sensor protein yellow chameleon and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . a pollen grain from a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transformant was placed on a papilla cell of the stigma of a wt plant . the pollen grain was hydrated after min . twenty minutes after pollination the intensity of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was predominantly increased at the site of pollen germination before pollen tube extension . intriguingly _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was also observed on the opposite side of the potential germination site . differential interference contrast microscopy revealed that hydration of the pollen grain occurred within min after pollination . just after hydration the concentration in the _LOCATION_ was highest in the center of the pollen grain but subsequently cyt increased at the potential germination sites . at min after pollination cyt was concentrated at the site of contact with the papilla cell . during pollen germination _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was concentrated at the same potential germination site . this accumulation pattern was completely consistent with cyt . in vitro pollen germination requires the presence of . in the pollen grain cyt was increased at the potential germination site after hydration and a tip focused gradient of cyt was formed before germination . in this study we found the existence of strong correlation between the formation of tip focused gradient and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ before germination suggesting that the establishment of _PROTEIN_ dependent _PROTEIN_ exocytosis to the germination site is required cyt gradient before germination . to improve this possibility a future experiment needed to be performed to clarify the possibility that channel blockers or treatment would affect the tip focused _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ accumulation . we also found that _PROTEIN_ distribution of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is f actin dependent . we previously reported that root hair tip focused accumulation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is also f actin dependent . these results suggest that focal accumulation of is f actin dependent during tip growth of the cell in arabidopsis . the signaling is known to induce organization of actin filaments . the connection between and actin filament is mediated by various actin biding proteins including _PROTEIN_ and . furthermore organization of actin filaments is known to promote vesicle trafficking for pollen tube elongation . therefore the establishment of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ coincident with the gradient might be dependent on the actin _LOCATION_ and actin binding proteins . in _PROTEIN_ an actin family protein was isolated with family proteins in an ip _METHOD_ analysis . in future studies an analysis of the spatiotemporal dynamics of actin and snares is needed to clarify the mechanism of dependent pollen tube elongation mediated by these snares . m. ichikawa performed the experiments and analyzed the data m. iwano assisted live cell imaging of pollen germination . m.h.s . designed the experiments and supervised the work and wrote the paper .
