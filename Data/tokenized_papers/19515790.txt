ultraviolet b light perception and signaling are well known phenomena in plants although no specific uv b photoreceptors have yet been identified . we previously reported on the root uv b _PROTEIN_ mutants in arabidopsis which display a block to development under very low fluence rate uv b after the seedling emerges from the seed . here we report the analysis and cloning of the _PROTEIN_ mutation in arabidopsis . the phenotype of _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings is virtually indistinguishable from the phenotype of _PROTEIN_ seedlings . a map based approach was used to clone _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ encodes a domain of unknown function _PROTEIN_ containing protein that is homologous to the _PROTEIN_ protein . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant seedlings have the same phenotype as both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutants suggesting that the two genes work in the same pathway . _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein shows a similar _PROTEIN_ pattern as that of _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins interact physically in yeast . this protein protein interaction depends on the _PROTEIN_ domain and site directed mutagenesis identified specific residues in _PROTEIN_ that are required for both protein protein interaction and physiological function . six rus genes are found in arabidopsis rice and moss and one rus member _PROTEIN_ is conserved in plants and animals . our results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ works with _PROTEIN_ in a root uv b sensing pathway that plays a vital role in arabidopsis early seedling morphogenesis and development .
_PROTEIN_ mutant plants display a stall in development after the radicle and cotyledons have emerged from the seed . cotyledons fail to green fully the root does not elongate and the development of true leaves is greatly delayed . interestingly _PROTEIN_ plants recover when transplanted from murashige and skoog _METHOD_ medium petri dishes into soil and also grow much better when sown directly onto soil . one major difference between the environments of the soil and the petri dish is the amount of light that the roots of the plants receive . we hypothesized that the light exposure difference between the soil and the _METHOD_ medium plates affects the phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . we observed that when the roots of _PROTEIN_ mutants are covered even on _METHOD_ plates the _PROTEIN_ phenotype is partially alleviated and the plants develop more like wild type plants . to analyze the role of light in the mutant phenotype of _PROTEIN_ plants we cut the relative amount of light to these plants by the use of neutral density filters . standard growth chamber _METHOD_ lights were used as the light source . _METHOD_ medium plates were covered by the nd filters to reduce the total light intensity . the total photosynthetically active radiation _PROTEIN_ for each condition is shown in table i . we previously analyzed the nd filters and found that they reduced the amount of light across all wavelengths . in this experiment we grew _PROTEIN_ seedlings alongside wild type ecotype columbia seedlings . we measured the amount of root growth for day old col and _PROTEIN_ seedlings under _PROTEIN_ total _PROTEIN_ conditions . as total _PROTEIN_ was reduced the _PROTEIN_ seedling root length increased . the lowered light intensities did not dramatically affect the wild type control although there was a slight increase in root length of the wild type as light intensities were reduced . etiolated _PROTEIN_ seedlings were very similar in this experiment to the wild type with an average root length that of the wild type . this experiment shows that the severity of the _PROTEIN_ phenotype is directly related to the intensity of light exposure . effect of fluence rates on _PROTEIN_ root development _PROTEIN_ mutant plants grown on _METHOD_ medium plates with exposed roots recover considerably when transferred to soil an environment where the roots are covered . therefore we hypothesized that the location of light perception responsible for the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype is the root . to test this hypothesis we covered the surface of _METHOD_ medium plates with black metal foil with pinholes through which the roots could grow . the black surface reduces the amount of light that the roots are exposed to while allowing the apical portions of the plant to be exposed to the normal amount of light . _PROTEIN_ plants grown horizontally on the uncovered control plate displayed a strong phenotype . _PROTEIN_ seedlings grown horizontally on black metal foil covered plates showed elongated roots and greener apical portions/cotyledons . this result suggests that the light environment of the root elicits not only the _PROTEIN_ root phenotype but also the shoot phenotype . growth of _PROTEIN_ plants on monochromatic light sources showed that none of the canonical light perception wavelengths is able to elicit the strong _PROTEIN_ phenotypes a phenomenon found in _PROTEIN_ . additionally _PROTEIN_ double mutants with phototropin phytochrome a phytochrome b and cryptochrome mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ still displayed the same rus mutant phenotype . therefore we hypothesized that uv b light was responsible for the _PROTEIN_ phenotype . to test this hypothesis we covered plates in our growth chamber with either a uv shield or a sheet of non uv absorbing plastic as a control . under the uv b shield conditions the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants recovered considerably reaching roughly half the root length of the wild type plant . the non uv absorbing plastic covered control plates did not show any recovery of the _PROTEIN_ phenotype . this result suggests that uv b is predominantly responsible for the mutant phenotypes in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . we measured a uv b fluence rate of in the normal light conditions in our growth chamber . of the nd filters that we used the one with the highest reduction in light intensity had a uv b fluence rate of . even in the nd light conditions a partial _PROTEIN_ phenotype was observed . thus we conclude from our data that lf and vlf uv b can elicit the _PROTEIN_ phenotype . the _PROTEIN_ mutation was identified from a screen for rus like phenotypes using fast neutron mutagenesis . to map the mutation we crossed a _PROTEIN_ plant with a wild type landsberg _LOCATION_ plant allowed the generation plants to self fertilize and collected seeds . using cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence and simple sequence length polymorphism genetic markers we rough mapped the _PROTEIN_ mutation to near the marker which is on the southern arm of chromosome ii . we used cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence and simple sequence length polymorphism markers to fine map the mutation to a region on bacterial artificial chromosome . as fast neutron mutagenesis can cause large lesions in dna we pcr amplified several genes in this region as a quick attempt to find altered pcr product lengths that might represent the _PROTEIN_ mutation . in the _PROTEIN_ background we were unable to amplify the full length _GENE_ gene despite being able to use the same primer pairs to amplify this gene in the wild type background . to complement the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype we cloned the _GENE_ gene in frame with the _METHOD_ coding sequence and transformed _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . the _GENE_ _METHOD_ transgene completely complements the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype in planta . to identify the nature of the _PROTEIN_ mutation we attempted to pcr amplify overlapping portions of _GENE_ for sequencing . although we could amplify regions at the end of the gene we failed to amplify internal portions of the gene in the _PROTEIN_ background despite being able to amplify these same fragments from the wild type . additionally we were unable to amplify across the entire length of the gene something that should be possible with a simple deletion . these results suggested that the mutation was the result of a chromosomal rearrangement . we determined the exact nature of the _PROTEIN_ mutation using thermal asymmetric interlaced pcr working from both ends of the gene toward the middle . thermal asymmetric interlaced pcr showed that the _PROTEIN_ mutation is a disruption in the last intron and that the chromosome was broken there and reattached incorrectly to another portion of chromosome ii . our results indicate that two break points occurred in chromosome ii and were repaired in a reverse orientation . the second break point is on bac after bp in a region where no genes are predicted to occur . at these two break point/repair sites no genomic dna was deleted and a single t/a base pair was added at each site . primers spanning either of the two break point sites yielded products only in the wild type . recombining the same set of primers amplified mutant _PROTEIN_ pieces as predicted . reverse transcription pcr analysis showed no _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ after the break point . as the _GENE_ gene is disrupted in the _PROTEIN_ background and capable of fully complementing the _PROTEIN_ phenotype in more than six independent lines we conclude that _PROTEIN_ is _GENE_ . _PROTEIN_ encodes a amino acid protein with no known function . a blast search with the _PROTEIN_ protein sequence uncovered the presence of an evolutionarily conserved domain called _PROTEIN_ in this protein . additionally the _PROTEIN_ protein is annotated by the arabidopsis information resource and national center for biotechnology information databases as containing a _PROTEIN_ from amino acids to . thus both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ share the _PROTEIN_ domain and mutations in either of the two genes produce very similar if not identical phenotypes . two protein blast alignments show that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are identical and similar across the conserved region of the proteins . the conserved regions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ essentially correspond to the _PROTEIN_ domain . therefore we conclude that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ containing homologs with similar mutant phenotypes . there is no predicted sequence similarity for the regions of the two proteins preceding the homologous regions . in order to ascertain the location of the _PROTEIN_ protein in vivo we cloned the _PROTEIN_ gene including promoter in frame with the _METHOD_ coding sequence . this construct fully complements the _PROTEIN_ phenotype . when visualized by confocal light scanning microscopy we detected a low level of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the root tip that was consistently higher than the background _METHOD_ of the wild type controls . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the root tip is strikingly similar to the localization we previously reported for the _PROTEIN_ protein . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ does not appear to be localized to the cell wall or specifically to the _LOCATION_ . despite only observing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the root tip we can not rule out that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is present in other tissues at levels below detection . in _PROTEIN_ rt pcr data for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ suggests that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ throughout the plant at a relatively uniform level . additionally genechip data obtained from the genevestigator resource is consistent with our analyses as it reports _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ throughout the plant body with about a fold increase in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the root tip as compared with other parts of the root . thus _PROTEIN_ transcript is _PROTEIN_ throughout the plant with strongest _PROTEIN_ in the root tip the region affected most strongly in the _PROTEIN_ phenotype . we analyzed the _PROTEIN_ protein sequence using the target signal prediction _METHOD_ wolf psort _METHOD_ and targetp . neither of these _METHOD_ predicts a strong subcellular localization for _PROTEIN_ . a previous well conducted proteomic study found the _PROTEIN_ protein in purified _LOCATION_ extracts . this is consistent with our _METHOD_ fusion results which show that _PROTEIN_ is not in the cell wall or _LOCATION_ and is not localized to the _LOCATION_ . additionally wolf psort and targetp predict that the _PROTEIN_ protein is localized to the _LOCATION_ and that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ shows virtually the identical _METHOD_ _METHOD_ pattern as _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . thus our data here are consistent with the empirical results reported before which show _PROTEIN_ to be in the chloroplast . we previously reported the characterization and cloning of the _PROTEIN_ mutations and their effects on arabidopsis seedlings grown under uv b light . the _PROTEIN_ mutation was identified in the same screen as the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations . early in our analyses we noted the striking similarities between _PROTEIN_ mutants and the _PROTEIN_ mutant described here . to analyze the genetic relationship between these two genes we crossed a _PROTEIN_ plant with a _PROTEIN_ plant . we used _PROTEIN_ in this cross as it is equally as strong as the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ alleles and it is in the same genetic background as _PROTEIN_ . offspring in the generation were phenotypically normal suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations are not affecting the same gene . due to the severity of these mutants we hypothesized that the double _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant would be even more severe possibly even embryo lethal . to create a double mutant we allowed the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants to self fertilize and collected seeds for the generation . from the generation we found a plant that was homozygous for both the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations and collected seeds for further analysis . when grown vertically on _METHOD_ medium plates under our normal growth chamber light conditions _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant appears indistinguishable from both the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutants . in the light the double mutant germinates and arrests at the same time as either of the single mutants . on _METHOD_ agar plates the roots of d old light grown _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant seedlings were of a comparable length to either of the single mutants . we next examined d old etiolated seedlings for the wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutants and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . the roots of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants greatly elongated in the dark as compared with the roots of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ light grown seedlings . the roots of the single and double mutants grew to about that of the wild type in the dark . these results support a rejection of our initial hypothesis that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant plants would be more severe than either single mutant alone . instead these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are both part of the same genetic pathway and are likely to function in the same biochemical pathway . a loss of either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ eliminates the function of this pathway so that a further loss of the other gene has little to no effect . as noted earlier _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutants have virtually identical phenotypes and the double _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant has a phenotype very similar to either of the single mutants alone . therefore _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants genetically interact in a way that strongly suggests that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are working in the same pathway . additionally the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ pattern is very similar to the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ pattern . as the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins share a similar domain we hypothesized that these proteins interact physically . in our experiences _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins are highly unstable in vitro and rapidly degrade even in the presence of _PROTEIN_ protease inhibitors and a reducing agent . this characteristic of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins made our in vitro analyses of these proteins unsuccessful . therefore we utilized a yeast two hybrid system to test for interactions between these proteins in an in vivo assay using various combinations of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins to test our hypothesis . we used the and vectors to create c terminal fusions with the activating domain and dna binding domain respectively . neither the _PROTEIN_ bd nor the _PROTEIN_ bd construct was self activating when cotransformed with an empty ad vector . we did not observe any self interaction for _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ in our system . in support of our original hypothesis we did observe interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . we next hypothesized that the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was via the _PROTEIN_ domain . we created constructs for _PROTEIN_ that contained either the _PROTEIN_ domain _PROTEIN_ or the region of the protein preceding the _PROTEIN_ domain _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ corresponds to amino acids to and the _PROTEIN_ corresponds to amino acids to . _PROTEIN_ was able to interact with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ did not show any interaction with _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ protein has only about amino acids before its _PROTEIN_ domain thus _PROTEIN_ is almost entirely a _PROTEIN_ domain already . therefore we obtained strong evidence that the _PROTEIN_ domain has a protein protein interaction function and is required for the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with the _PROTEIN_ protein . next we used site directed mutagenesis on the _PROTEIN_ ad constructs to alter four selected conserved _PROTEIN_ amino acids in the _PROTEIN_ domain . two of these mutant _PROTEIN_ proteins failed to interact with _PROTEIN_ in our yeast two hybrid system . the other two mutant _PROTEIN_ proteins interacted with _PROTEIN_ but the observed interaction was much weaker than that with the wild type . we created _PROTEIN_ constructs with these same point mutations and transformed them into _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . we observed at least partial rescue of the _PROTEIN_ phenotype with all of these mutant constructs . interestingly the amount of rescue was greater in the two mutants that showed partial interaction via yeast two hybrid assay . the _PROTEIN_ that these mutant proteins can at least partially suppress the _PROTEIN_ phenotype in vivo is evidence that the mutant versions are being produced . the ability of the non yeast two hybrid interacting mutants to partially suppress the _PROTEIN_ phenotype suggests that there are additional _PROTEIN_ in the plant that support the function of the _PROTEIN_ complex . thus these data strongly support the hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ physically interact via the _PROTEIN_ domain and that this interaction is important for their function in vivo . we searched the completed arabidopsis genome and found a total of six _PROTEIN_ encoding genes . we named the additional rus genes based on their genomic positions _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the rice and moss genomes also had six rus genes each . we named the rice and moss genes based on their similarity to arabidopsis rus genes as follows and . phylogenetic analyses of the six rus protein sequences from arabidopsis rice and moss revealed large orthology among these proteins in these species . clear orthologous clades exist for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in these species . relationships for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were less strongly supported in our analysis . none of the six arabidopsis rus proteins appears to be the result of a lineage specific duplication . this can be concluded because all six of the arabidopsis rus proteins have an obvious ortholog in rice moss or both that is more similar to it than any of the other five arabidopsis rus proteins . _PROTEIN_ previously identified as an embryo lethal gene is duplicated in both rice and moss but not in arabidopsis . _PROTEIN_ appears to have been lost in rice and _PROTEIN_ appears to have been lost in moss although the topology is not as strongly defined for these gene products as for the other four . to analyze the _PROTEIN_ of the rus genes in arabidopsis we performed rt pcr on rna collected from various tissues and developmental time points of wild type plants . we observed _PROTEIN_ of all six rus genes in all of our samples . we next looked for rus genes in the completed animal genomes by blast search with the _PROTEIN_ protein . we found a single rus gene in each of the human mouse drosophila zebrafish pufferfish horse and cow genomes . interestingly we were unable to identify a rus homolog in the _PROTEIN_ genome despite using multiple search methods . the mouse genome database lists mmrus cdnas from various tissues including heart spleen bone marrow dendritic cells salivary gland melanoma and mammary gland tumors . genechip data from genenote shows _PROTEIN_ of hsrus at a similar level in all tissues tested . thus rus genes do not appear to be _PROTEIN_ in specific tissues in the _METHOD_ for which _PROTEIN_ data exists . various fungal species have rus proteins but the relationship to plant or animal rus proteins is not clear and some fungi such as saccharomyces cerevisiae do not have any rus proteins . this lack shows that it is possible for some eukaryotes to live without rus protein although the vast majority of eukaryotic genomes that we searched have at least one . a rus protein from the fungal species coprinopsis cinerea has a predicted protein with an oxidoreductase enzyme fused in front of a _PROTEIN_ domain . this is interesting because in the over rus proteins we looked at from various species it is the only example that has an additional predicted domain besides _PROTEIN_ . this has perhaps been misannotated as previously a mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase _PROTEIN_ fused protein was predicted in a neurospora species only _PROTEIN_ to be annotated as two separate proteins . therefore the overwhelming bulk of sequence data suggest that rus proteins are made up primarily of the _PROTEIN_ domain . additional parts of rus proteins are typically small and nonconserved . to analyze the phylogenetic relationships between rus proteins we performed a clustalw alignment which we then used to create a phylogenetic tree using maximum likelihood point accepted mutation with neighbor joining . for our analysis we used protein sequences from arabidopsis rice moss the green algae ostreococcus lucimarinus human mouse zebrafish and drosophila . interestingly the rus protein in animals clusters with from arabidopsis and the phylogeny constructed for _PROTEIN_ proteins mimics the phylogenetic relationship of these species . these data suggest that the plant _PROTEIN_ proteins are true orthologs of the rus proteins in animal lineages . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ also have highly supported clades between the moss rice and arabidopsis lineages strongly supporting the orthology of these genes between these species . the _PROTEIN_ cluster is a monophyletic grouping within the larger rus phylogeny which suggests that there were several rus genes in the ancestor of animals and plants and that only the _PROTEIN_ ortholog has been _PROTEIN_ in animals . however the base of the rus family tree is only weakly defined with very short branch lengths between groupings . therefore we can not rule out that the additional rus genes in plants are the result of early duplications in the plant kingdom . it is very likely however that the common ancestor of moss and higher plants had multiple rus genes as there is a clear orthological relationship between the moss rus proteins and the rice and arabidopsis rus proteins . the o. lucimarinus genome has two rus genes one that clusters with _PROTEIN_ and another that does not clearly cluster with any of the rus proteins from plants . thus rus proteins exist in most plants and animals and in some fungi but the basal relationships are not clearly definable . we conclude that the animal rus protein has an ortholog in plants and that that ortholog is _PROTEIN_ .
arabidopsis plants were grown as described before . for petri dish grown seedlings surface sterilized seeds were either cold treated at for at least h or were without any cold treatment before being plated on _METHOD_ growth medium with suc on square plates that were kept vertically in a growth chamber . for soil grown plants seeds with or without the cold treatment were directly sown in pots containing sterilized soil medium and kept in a growth chamber with a h h dark cycle at a constant temperature . white growth light was provided by cool white _METHOD_ light tubes and _PROTEIN_ at . for various light fluence levels the following filters were used lee nd lee nd lee nd and lee nd . other light treatments were followed as described previously . for non uv b filters a transparent plexiglass acrylic sheet was _PROTEIN_ from ridout plastics for the uv filter a mm photodyne uv filter was _PROTEIN_ from spectronics . light fluence measurements and spectral analyses were carried out using a wideband spectroradiometer _PROTEIN_ and its software . the _PROTEIN_ mutation segregates as a typical recessive allele . the ratio of wild type to _PROTEIN_ from the parents is _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants were created by crossing _PROTEIN_ to the three available _PROTEIN_ alleles _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the double mutation was confirmed by known established markers . genotyping analysis and a map based approach were followed as described previously . seven day old seedlings were used for _METHOD_ detection . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was excited by a blue argon laser and detected at to nm wavelengths in a nikon confocal microscope . whole roots were directly mounted in water and observed with water objectives . wild type seedlings were used as negative controls . images were processed and arranged by adobe photoshop version . vertically grown plates were photographed and the images were analyzed using the imagej program . root lengths were determined by measuring the length of a line traced along the root . rna was extracted from plant tissues using the rneasy mini kit and quantified spectrophotometrically . reverse transcriptase reactions were carried out using the onestep rt pcr kit . the reactions were scaled down from to with all reagents kept at the same final concentrations . for each reaction ng of total extracted rna was used . reverse transcriptase reactions were done for min at followed by a min step to activate the hotstartaq dna polymerase . the pcrs were done for to cycles depending on the gene . the pcr temperatures and times were as follows s of denaturing at s of annealing at and min of extension at . the reaction products were run on agarose gels and imaged using a kodak image station . products were sequenced to confirm identity . primer sequences and cycle numbers are available upon request . yeast two hybrid analysis was performed using the vectors from the matchmaker two hybrid library and construction kit . cdnas were cloned into either or and transformed into yeast to create yeast containing a single vector . yeast were mated together to create yeast with two vectors for two hybrid analysis . confirmation of the presence of both vectors was performed by growing the yeast on medium lacking trp and leu . experimental protein protein interaction was determined by growth on plates lacking trp leu and his and containing bromo chloro indolyl d galactoside . vectors provided by the matchmaker kit were used as controls . for control experiments yeast were generated with the rec plasmid and either the or the lam vector for positive and negative controls respectively . proteins were aligned using the clustalw program . the _PROTEIN_ was used for pair wise alignment with an open gap penalty of and an extend gap penalty of . multiple alignment was performed using the blosum series with an open gap penalty of an extend gap penalty of and a delay divergent of . trees were constructed using the phylip phylogenetic analysis _METHOD_ . trees were constructed using protdist with point accepted mutation settings followed by the neighbor program for neighbor joining analysis . for bootstrap analysis the seqboot program was used prior to the protdist and neighbor _METHOD_ followed by the consensus program to create a consensus tree . a total of samples were used for bootstrapping . trees were drawn with the drawtree program . sequence data from this article can be found in the genbank/embl data libraries under accession numbers and .
