the arabidopsis thaliana metal tolerance protein _PROTEIN_ of the cation diffusion facilitator family of _LOCATION_ transport proteins can mediate the detoxification of zn in arabidopsis and yeast . xenopus laevis oocytes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ accumulate more zn than oocytes _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ mutant or water injected oocytes . an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein localizes to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in root and leaf cells . the analysis of arabidopsis transformed with a promoter gus construct suggests that _PROTEIN_ is not produced throughout the plant but primarily in the subpopulation of dividing differentiating and expanding cells . rna interference mediated silencing of _PROTEIN_ causes zn hypersensitivity and a reduction in zn concentrations in vegetative plant tissues .
in order to address the transport function of _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ protein or the _PROTEIN_ mutant protein were _PROTEIN_ in yeast . in the _PROTEIN_ protein an aspartate residue which is strictly conserved in all members of the cdf protein family and located in the second predicted _LOCATION_ spanning segment within the cdf signature sequence was replaced by an alanine . an analogous mutation of the corresponding residue in the a. halleri _PROTEIN_ protein results in the loss of the ability to complement the zinc sensitive double mutant of s. cerevisiae . as shown before the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ complemented the zn sensitivity of the double mutant . in addition including several low zn concentrations revealed that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ exacerbated zn hypersensitivity of the double mutant . both proteins were _PROTEIN_ in yeast cells in comparable amounts . this suggested that _PROTEIN_ was not only unable to mediate the detoxification of zn in the yeast _LOCATION_ but caused additional stress . to gain more information we allowed cells to equilibrate in a neutral red solution at alkaline ph a condition which should allow passive diffusion of the uncharged neutral red molecule a weak base and trapping in acidic compartments upon protonation . the less intense red staining of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ yeast cells when compared with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells or empty vector transformants suggests that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ results in a reduced ability of yeast cells to _PROTEIN_ an acidic _LOCATION_ lumen . this observation may be due to the leakage of protons through the mutant transporter . alternatively another ion such as na may leak through the transporter and lead indirectly to a depletion of the proton gradient . next we tested whether zn accumulation in oocytes injected with _PROTEIN_ crna differed from zn accumulation in oocytes injected with mtp crna or with water . oocytes injected with _PROTEIN_ crna contained on average nmol zn per oocyte after incubation in control medium and nmol zn per oocyte after exposure to the zn supplemented medium _PROTEIN_ . this suggests a net influx of nmol zn per oocyte during exposure to mm znso for min . in water injected and atmtp injected oocytes mean zn concentrations were very similar and amounted to between and nmol zn per oocyte for control oocytes and between and nmol zn per oocyte in zn exposed oocytes _PROTEIN_ . this suggests a net efflux of approximately nmol zn per oocyte in control oocytes during exposure to mm zn for min . the apparent net zn efflux in water or atmtp injected oocytes upon exposure to zn is likely to reflect the induction of an endogenous zn export activity during exposure to zn for min . most probably this export activity was also present in _PROTEIN_ injected oocytes . the correction for _PROTEIN_ independent zn efflux thus results in a total _PROTEIN_ dependent zn influx of nmol per oocyte in min . zn uptake rates could not be determined using shorter exposures because of the limited sensitivity of icp oes . it was also not possible to obtain permission to use the radioisotope zn . these data are consistent with a significant proportion of the _PROTEIN_ protein localizing to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of oocytes in this _PROTEIN_ system and mediating the cellular influx of zn . overall zn concentrations measured in the oocytes were consistent with the previously reported zn content of ng per oocyte in stage vi . to determine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ we localized a transiently _PROTEIN_ fusion protein of an n terminal _METHOD_ moiety and _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts of a. thaliana . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of transfected protoplasts . to verify these results we generated stable a. thaliana transformants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with an _METHOD_ moiety fused to its c terminus . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signal was localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in leaf as well as root cells . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ localizes to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of plant cells . two attempts of generating an _PROTEIN_ specific antibody were unsuccessful . to better understand the in planta function of _PROTEIN_ we analyzed steady state _PROTEIN_ transcript levels by real time rt pcr . as reported earlier no induction of _PROTEIN_ transcripts was observed in response to exposure to zn in either roots or shoots after exposure for between h and days . in addition we did not observe an increase in transcript levels in either roots or shoots upon exposure to an excess of cd co cu fe or mn for days using quantitative real time rt pcr . next we investigated whether _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ differentially in different plant organs . _PROTEIN_ transcripts were detected at similar levels in all analyzed tissues namely entire mature flowers the inflorescence stem cauline and young rosette leaves as well as in roots of mature plants . in siliques transcript levels were slightly higher than in the other tissues analyzed . to gain further information on the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ we analyzed plants transformed with a gus reporter gene construct incorporating approximately kpb of the _PROTEIN_ promoter region the untranslated region of _PROTEIN_ containing one or two introns and the first bp of the intron free _PROTEIN_ coding sequence . the construct thus encoded the first two n terminal transmembrane segments of _PROTEIN_ fused to the _PROTEIN_ reporter protein . gus activity was detectable in the youngest leaves of young seedlings as well as in the hydathodes of older leaves . gus activity was particularly high in the root _METHOD_ of young day old seedlings . with increasing seedling age gus activity _PROTEIN_ in most parts of the roots but remained very high in the tips of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ roots . in mature plants there was virtually no histochemically detectable gus activity in fully expanded leaves . flower buds displayed an intense gus staining primarily in the carpels . gus activity in carpels _PROTEIN_ during flower maturation and was low and confined to the abscission zone in young siliques but remained high in filaments and in pollen grains of mature flowers . gus activity was also high in the upper part of the inflorescence stem but not detectable in the lower part . during maturation of siliques gus activity was highest in developing seeds between and days after pollination and _PROTEIN_ afterwards . in a section of a developing seed gus activity was localized in the embryo and endosperm . to investigate whether gus activity was representative of steady state transcript levels we analyzed the atgenexpress data of organs at comparable developmental stages . according to the atgenexpress data _PROTEIN_ transcript levels are highest in developing seeds and in mature pollen . the atgenexpress database further indicates that in young seedlings _PROTEIN_ transcript levels are higher in roots than in shoots and tend to _PROTEIN_ between and days of plant age . finally transcript levels are higher in the vegetative apex the inflorescence and in young flowers than in rosette leaves . the publicly available transcript data is thus qualitatively in agreement with gus staining patterns in gus lines . ectopic overexpression of an _PROTEIN_ cdna under the control of a camv promoter has previously been shown to slightly enhance zn tolerance . this is consistent with the localization of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and a cellular function in the transport of zn ions into the _LOCATION_ for sequestration as described here . however in order to define the role of _PROTEIN_ in planta a loss of function mutant is more appropriate . a putative t dna knockout line was identified in the syngenta collection . this line harbored two tandem t dnas in an intron of the _PROTEIN_ gene bp upstream of the translational start codon of _PROTEIN_ . in this line _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were not reduced compared to wild type plants . a. thaliana plants were transformed with an intron spliced hairpin construct designed for _PROTEIN_ silencing by rna interference . this construct contained two identical bp fragments of the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence in reverse orientation separated by an intron downstream of the strong constitutive camv promoter . based on the assumption that plants with reduced _PROTEIN_ protein levels are likely to be zinc hypersensitive seeds were selected for _PROTEIN_ of the resistance marker and transformants were subsequently transferred onto media containing high zn concentrations . all _PROTEIN_ rnai transformant individuals were hypersensitive to zn in the generation . to confirm that _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were reduced in these plants we performed quantitative real time rt pcr . on average transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ rnai transformant seedlings were reduced to of those found in empty vector control transformants in the generation . in a. thaliana the and _PROTEIN_ coding sequences are the most homologous to _PROTEIN_ with and identity respectively within the cdna fragment chosen for rna interference . the longest stretch of identical nucleotides of consecutive nucleotides is found between the chosen fragment from _PROTEIN_ and the sequence . relative to empty vector controls _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were slightly reduced to on average about whereas transcript levels were not reduced in _PROTEIN_ rna interference transformants . root elongation was significantly more sensitive to zn in _PROTEIN_ rnai transformants than in empty vector transformants at and zn . there was no difference in root elongation under control or zinc deficiency conditions . this suggests that _PROTEIN_ contributes to basal zn tolerance in a. thaliana . to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ contributes to zn accumulation in a. thaliana zn concentrations were analyzed in various organs collected from mature plants grown on soil . compared to the wild type zn concentrations were significantly lower in the inflorescence stem and in cauline leaves and rosette leaves of _PROTEIN_ rna interference plants . compared to empty vector transformants _PROTEIN_ rnai plants contained and zn in the stem in cauline leaves and rosette leaves respectively in an independent experiment . this suggests that _PROTEIN_ is involved in determining the strength of these organs as depositories for zn in a. thaliana . in contrast zn concentrations in reproductive sink organs namely flowers and siliques which contained the highest zn concentrations appeared unaffected by reduced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in seeds of wild type and rnai plants zn concentrations were mg kg and mg kg respectively . it has to be kept in _PROTEIN_ that the residual levels of _PROTEIN_ transcript in the rna interference plants imply that some _PROTEIN_ protein was likely to be present in these plants .

mmessage mmachine kit or the mmessage mmachine ultra kit . stage v and vi xenopus oocytes were prepared as described previously . for zn accumulation experiments oocytes were injected with nl h o or ng crna per oocyte for _PROTEIN_ or atmtp respectively . injected oocytes were _PROTEIN_ in barth s medium composed as follows mm n hydroxyethylpiperazine n propanesulfonic acid naoh ph mm nacl mm kcl mm nahco mm ca mm cacl mm mgso supplemented with mg l gentamycin . seventy two hours after injection pools of oocytes were subjected to the following treatments at min in medium or min in medium supplemented with mm znso respectively . the medium was composed as follows mm nacl mm kcl mm mgcl and mm hepes ph was adjusted to with naoh . after the exposures oocyte pools were transferred onto ice immediately and rinsed three times with ice cold medium at ph . subsequently the remaining drops of medium were carefully removed . oocytes were dried at for days . oocyte pools were digested and analyzed as described by inductively coupled _LOCATION_ optical emission _METHOD_ . the experiment was repeated independently using a different batch of oocytes . results were qualitatively similar but all oocytes contained higher zn concentrations . to generate yeast _PROTEIN_ constructs the _PROTEIN_ cdnas were introduced into the target vector which generates a translational fusion of the encoded protein to an n terminal triple hemagglutinin epitope tag . transformation of the double mutant strain was performed as described and transformants were selected on synthetic complete minimal medium ura . for each construct overnight liquid cultures of four independent transformant colonies grown in low phosphate low sulphate synthetic minimal medium _PROTEIN_ ura medium supplemented with _PROTEIN_ and znso were washed once in fresh culture medium and used to inoculate ml of the same medium with concentrations of added znso between and mm at a cell density of cells ml . cultures were incubated at with constant mixing in a culture wheel . optical density was measured at nm in to h intervals . the doubling time was determined for the phase of maximum growth between and h after the beginning of cultivation . the experiment was repeated three times . cells were collected by centrifugation from low zn control cultures of equivalent cell densities after h of culture . total protein was extracted separated on a denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto a pvdf _LOCATION_ using a semidry blotting apparatus . _LOCATION_ were blocked in milk powder tween in tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane buffered saline and then incubated in a solution of milk powder tween in tbs containing monoclonal mouse anti ha antibody . _LOCATION_ were washed three times in the same solution without antibodies for min and then incubated in the same solution containing anti mouse igg coupled to horseradish peroxidase _PROTEIN_ for h followed by three washes as described above and chemiluminescent detection _PROTEIN_ . for neutral red loading ml cultures of equivalent cell densities grown in minimal medium at zn for h were sedimented at g for min resuspended in an equal volume of fresh minimal medium and incubated with mixing at for min . after sedimentation yeast cells were suspended in ml mm na _PROTEIN_ at ph adjusted with hcl containing neutral red and incubated at with gentle agitation for min . cells were washed once in ml mm potassium phosphate buffer at ph and finally suspended in of the same buffer . equal volumes were transferred into each well of a well microtiter plate for scanning of the color image . to generate a construct encoding a chimeric fusion protein of an n terminal rssm _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ cdna was subcloned by in vitro site directed recombination into the plant transient _PROTEIN_ vector n _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ for gateway cloning . protoplasts were prepared from an a. thaliana suspension culture and transfected as described . between and h after transfection _METHOD_ was imaged by confocal microscopy with excitation at nm and the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ emission signal was detected between and nm . a coding sequence of the _PROTEIN_ cdna lacking the translational stop codon was introduced by site directed recombination into the binary vector designed for translational fusion of the encoded protein to a c terminal enhanced green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . the resulting vector was introduced into agrobacterium tumefaciens by electroporation and six a. thaliana plants were used for transformation employing the floral dip method . transformant individuals were selected on vertical plates containing murashige skoog _METHOD_ medium sucrose phytagar and mg l kanamycin for days . seedlings were

immediately in liquid nitrogen and subsequently stored at . total rna was isolated from mg subsamples after homogenization using rneasy plant mini kit . the quantity of rna was determined spectrophotometrically and its quality was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis . rna was treated with rnase free dnase i for min followed by dnase i removal . two _METHOD_ of dna free rna was reverse transcribed using first stand synthesis system for rt pcr according to the manufacturer s specifications . the absence of genomic dna was verified by performing a control reaction omitting reverse transcriptase for each template and by performing pcr with primers for the _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ and gcaggacggatgttgggttcacta . these primers span an intron of the genomic _PROTEIN_ sequence and thus amplify a product of bp from cdna and bp from genomic dna . pcr conditions and primers were optimized for amplification efficiencies of for all primer pairs used . _PROTEIN_ specific primers were acggccatgaccatcacaatc and tgcttgtcctctccatgacca . primers specific for the constitutively _PROTEIN_ control gene _PROTEIN_ were ccaggtgtactttcaatggcg and caaacaccacatgccttcca . these primer pairs were designed to specifically amplify fragments of approximately bp of the coding sequence _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the real time pcr was performed using the qpcr mastermix for sybr green kit

_METHOD_ . amplification was performed for cycles and data were analyzed as described . amplification efficiency was calculated using absolute _METHOD_ data captured during the exponential phase of amplification of each real time pcr to ensure equal amplification for all primer pairs . the relative transcript level for _PROTEIN_ was calculated by normalizing to _PROTEIN_ as follows rtl c t whereby c t c t _PROTEIN_ c t _PROTEIN_ . after completion of each pcr reaction all pcr products were checked by melting curve analysis and by agarose gel electrophoresis . three independent replicate experiments were conducted . the generation of a fusion construct of the promoter region of _PROTEIN_ and the e. coli uida gene was out contracted . the constructs were made from pcr products amplified from a. thaliana genomic dna in the vector pgptv kan . based on full length _PROTEIN_ cdnas available in the databases the construct incorporated bp of the promoter region followed by the genomic region encoding the utr of _PROTEIN_ and containing one or two introns upstream of the intron less coding sequence of _PROTEIN_ as well as the first bp of the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence .

acetic acid for min . samples were kept in ethanol at or room temperature . selected tissues were embedded in technovit resin for subsequent sectioning using a microtome . other samples were embedded in low melt agarose in ddh o and cut using a vibratome . sections of _PROTEIN_ were stained in a solution contained mm na po buffer mm edta mm potassium ferrocyanide triton x and mm x _PROTEIN_ as described above . a bp fragment encompassing nucleotides of the bp long coding sequence of _PROTEIN_ was amplified from cdna using primers _PROTEIN_ and acggatccatttaaattcttttgctgcgacttga . the restriction sites introduced by the primers asc i and swa i and bam hi and xba i respectively were used to sequentially introduce the fragment in opposite orientation into the binary vector . after transformation of a. thaliana as described above seeds of the generation were surface sterilized and transformants were selected on vertical plates filled with murashige skoog _METHOD_ medium containing sucrose mg ml dl phosphinotricine and phytagar . each selected individual plant thus represented an independent transformant line . for experiments day old seedlings were transferred either onto soil or onto vertical plastic petri dishes containing modified strength hoagland solution with sucrose phytagar and between and znso . three replicate plates each containing ten seedlings were set up for each genotype and each zn concentration . plants were photographed and harvested after days for the determination of final root length and the analysis of transcript levels . rna was

levels and zn tolerance . for the determination of zn accumulation day old plants were transferred individually into cm pots of soil following selection as described above . after growth in the greenhouse for days plant tissues were harvested separately . seeds were harvested at maturity . tissues collected from nine replicate plants were pooled from groups of three plants to generate three
