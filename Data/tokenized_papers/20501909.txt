long distance transport of nitrate requires xylem loading and unloading a successive process that determines nitrate distribution and subsequent assimilation efficiency . here we report the functional characterization of _PROTEIN_ a member of the nitrate transporter _PROTEIN_ family in arabidopsis thaliana . _PROTEIN_ is upregulated by nitrate . histochemical analysis using promoter _PROTEIN_ fusions as well as in situ hybridization showed that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ predominantly in xylem parenchyma cells within the vasculature . transient _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ enhanced green _METHOD_ protein fusion in onion epidermal cells and arabidopsis protoplasts indicated that _PROTEIN_ is _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized . electrophysiological and nitrate uptake analyses using xenopus laevis oocytes showed that _PROTEIN_ mediates low affinity nitrate uptake . functional disruption of _PROTEIN_ significantly increased the nitrate concentration in xylem sap . these data together suggest that _PROTEIN_ functions to remove nitrate from xylem vessels . interestingly _PROTEIN_ was the only nitrate assimilatory pathway gene that was strongly upregulated by cadmium stress in roots and the _PROTEIN_ mutant showed a nitrate dependent sensitive phenotype . further analyses showed that stress increases the proportion of nitrate allocated to wild type roots compared with the _PROTEIN_ mutant . these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ regulated nitrate distribution plays an important role in tolerance .
the _PROTEIN_ gene family contains members with nitrate transporters having been identified in several divergent subfamilies . microarray data indicated that the _GENE_ gene in the _PROTEIN_ family is regulated by nitrate suggesting that it might encode a nitrate transporter . thus we assigned the name _PROTEIN_ to the _GENE_ gene . a full length cdna of _PROTEIN_ was cloned using high fidelity rt pcr based on est information from the munich information center for protein sequences . the sequence was further confirmed by a blast search against the arabidopsis information resource database . _PROTEIN_ is predicted to contain four exons and three introns encoding a transmembrane protein with amino acids and the typical transmembrane domains observed in all other _PROTEIN_ family members . the deduced protein sequence of _PROTEIN_ is similar to all identified _PROTEIN_ type nitrate transporters and showed identity with _PROTEIN_ its closest family member . we further performed rt pcr to characterize the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ under various nitrate treatments . as shown in figure after d of nitrate starvation a low level of _PROTEIN_ mrna was detected in roots . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was induced by mm and stronger induction was observed when and mm were added . these results showed that _PROTEIN_ is responsive to external nitrate in a concentration dependent manner . in situ hybridization further confirmed this result . to determine the tissue specific _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ histochemical analyses were performed using transgenic lines harboring the _PROTEIN_ gene driven by the _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ . as shown in figure gus activity was maximally and constitutively detected in the vasculature of arabidopsis seedlings . cross sectioned young seedling roots showed _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ within the stele . longitudinal sectioning further demonstrated _PROTEIN_ in parenchyma cells abutting xylem vessels . these results suggested that _PROTEIN_ may be involved in xylem loading or unloading . we further performed mrna in situ hybridization to exclude the possibility that gus activity leakage was responsible for these results . consistent with the gus analysis in situ hybridization also localized _PROTEIN_ accumulation to xylem parenchyma cells in the stele . in the control experiment using the sense _PROTEIN_ probe no signal was detected . these results confirmed that the gus activity analysis was reliable and _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in xylem parenchyma cells within the vasculature . to investigate the subcellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ was fused in frame with enhanced green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and subcloned into the binary vector pgreenii . transient _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in onion epidermal cells showed that green _METHOD_ was localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of plasmolyzed cells compared with the diffuse nucleocytoplasmic localization of the _METHOD_ control . to further confirm this result we _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in arabidopsis protoplasts . consistently green _METHOD_ was also observed at the protoplast _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . these data indicated that _PROTEIN_ is _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized . electrophysiological analyses were performed using xenopus laevis oocytes injected with _PROTEIN_ crna to determine whether _PROTEIN_ is a nitrate transporter . in uninjected oocytes exposure to mm nitrate at ph induced a small inward current when oocytes were clamped to mv . on average this current was approximately na . by contrast out of _PROTEIN_ injected oocytes from four separate batches showed large inward currents which averaged approximately na . uptake analyses in oocytes showed that _PROTEIN_ mediated nitrate uptake at mm external nitrate but not nitrate which is comparable to _PROTEIN_ . to determine the apparent affinity of _PROTEIN_ for nitrate we exposed oocytes to and mm at ph . in _PROTEIN_ injected oocytes currents began to saturate at mm nitrate . higher nitrate concentrations induced leak currents also in uninjected control oocytes . based on data from five oocytes from two batches we calculated a km of _PROTEIN_ for nitrate of mm _LOCATION_ . currents at mm nitrate averaged na whereas in uninjected oocytes they averaged na _PROTEIN_ . we concluded that _PROTEIN_ is a low affinity nitrate transporter . in oocyte experiments nitrate was added as . no additional monovalent mineral cations were present in the bath solution that contained mm . in addition increasing external induced larger inward currents and shifted the reversal potential to more positive values . together these data indicated that the nitrate induced inward current in _PROTEIN_ injected oocytes represents proton coupled nitrate uptake . this is typical for most of the other characterized nitrate transporters in the _PROTEIN_ family . consistent with this _PROTEIN_ mediated nitrate currents or uptake were larger than background at ph but not at ph . considering that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of xylem parenchyma cells and is a functional nitrate uptake transporter we suspected that _PROTEIN_ might function to take up nitrate into xylem parenchyma cells from the xylem . disruption of _PROTEIN_ should thus result in nitrate accumulation in the xylem sap . to test this hypothesis xylem sap was collected from wild type wassilewskija plants and a t dna insertion mutant _PROTEIN_ in which full length _PROTEIN_ transcript accumulation was not detected . as expected the nitrate concentration in _PROTEIN_ xylem sap was significantly higher than in that from ws plants . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ functions in transporting nitrate across xylem parenchyma cell _LOCATION_ to unload nitrate from the xylem sap . _PROTEIN_ was initially identified based on its dramatic upregulation by stress in microarray experiments and hypothesized to provide an oligopeptide mediated transport mechanism since _PROTEIN_ type oligopeptide transporters belong to the same family as _PROTEIN_ transporters . however our data demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ does not transport tripeptide glutathione and is unlikely to transport the much larger oligopeptide phytochelatins the most studied chelators but is a nitrate transporter . subsequently we analyzed why strongly induces _PROTEIN_ . the nonessential heavy metal has been observed to severely inhibit nitrate assimilation . microarray analyses showed that _PROTEIN_ was the only gene in the nitrate assimilation pathway that was dramatically upregulated by stress suggesting that _PROTEIN_ might be an essential component in the interaction between nitrate assimilation and tolerance to stress . to test our hypothesis we performed rna gel blots to confirm and further characterize the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pattern under stress . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ was undetectable in roots without or with for h while at h _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was significantly induced by . by contrast strongly induced _PROTEIN_ within h . in shoots in addition to a constitutively low _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was also induced by long term exposure to . quantitative rt pcr analyses further confirmed these results . in roots the _PROTEIN_ mrna level under the control condition was about of that for the gene . when exposed to the _PROTEIN_ level gradually increased with prolonged exposure and reached fold of that for after h . treatment with rapidly and significantly induced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in roots . by contrast only prolonged treatment could significantly induce _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in shoots most likely because of the time needed for transport and accumulation in shoots . these results indicated that regulates _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in a dose and time dependent manner consistent with the _PROTEIN_ pattern under induction . note that is very toxic to plants thus long term experiments were not performed at this concentration . subsequently in vivo functional analyses were also performed . when grown on minimal medium supplemented with both _PROTEIN_ and ws showed similar reduced growth compared with the control . considering that _PROTEIN_ is a nitrate transporter we then treated with various combinations of nitrate and . as shown in figure when both mm and were applied root elongation of _PROTEIN_ was significantly reduced compared with that of the wild type while no significant difference was observed in rosettes . when exposed to mm only no obvious difference was observed between _PROTEIN_ and ws . further elevating to mm in combination with resulted in a more apparent growth reduction in mutant aerial parts as well as secondary root formation . complementation lines harboring the genomic sequence of _PROTEIN_ exhibited a less severe sensitivity phenotype comparable to the wild type . these results indicated that the wild type _PROTEIN_ transporter increases tolerance in a nitrate dependent manner in arabidopsis . to investigate the underlying mechanism of nitrate dependent sensitivity we determined the nitrate concentration in arabidopsis shoots and roots normalized by fresh weight to compare plant lines with differing growth rates . under normal conditions the nitrate level in both shoots and roots was similar in ws _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants . the root/shoot nitrate ratio was in ws in mutant _PROTEIN_ and in the complementation line _PROTEIN_ . but when _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is strongly induced in roots by the proportion of nitrate concentration in ws roots increased to of that in shoots . by contrast in the _PROTEIN_ mutant stress _PROTEIN_ the root/shoot nitrate ratio from to . in the complementation lines the induced root/shoot nitrate ratio alteration was comparable to that observed in the wild type . these data demonstrate that under stress a greater proportion of nitrate accumulates in the wild type ws roots compared with _PROTEIN_ and suggest that the induction of _PROTEIN_ in roots permits ws to continue removing nitrate from the xylem when toxicity limits nitrate reductase activity . note that under stress the overall nitrate concentration was _PROTEIN_ in both ws and _PROTEIN_ mutant as would be expected due to toxicity . the distribution within plants was also determined . as shown in figure more accumulated in _PROTEIN_ shoots when compared with both ws and _PROTEIN_ while in roots less was detected in the mutant than in the wild type and the complementation lines . interestingly more accumulation was also observed in xylem sap from _PROTEIN_ than in sap from the wild type control and the complementation lines . _PROTEIN_ was shown to load nitrate into the xylem and our data suggest that _PROTEIN_ functions to unload nitrate from the xylem . furthermore our microarray data showed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were oppositely regulated by stress . these observations indicate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may be fine tuned to regulate nitrate distribution between shoots and roots under stress . to test our hypothesis rna gel blots were performed . as shown in figure under control conditions _PROTEIN_ showed constitutively high _PROTEIN_ in roots while in shoots no _PROTEIN_ mrna was detected . when treated with for h _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was reduced as is observed in microarray analyses . further quantitative rt pcr showed that in roots low level treatments gradually reduced _PROTEIN_ mrna levels with time while high level treatment rapidly and significantly reduced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . this was in contrast to what was observed for _PROTEIN_ . in shoots no significant change was observed for _PROTEIN_ mrna levels . note that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels are very low in aerial parts . consequently the standard deviation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels in shoots measured by quantitative rt pcr was large . further analyses revealed a similar opposite pattern between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrna level changes under various environmental stresses . as shown for some stress examples in figure _PROTEIN_ was consistently upregulated while _PROTEIN_ was downregulated and more examples were found in the genevestigator database . these observations suggest that the coordinated opposite regulation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ might be a universal mechanism in response to environmental stresses . considering that _PROTEIN_ functions to load nitrate into the xylem disruption of _PROTEIN_ is expected to reduce the nitrate concentration in the xylem . a previous study observed that the rate of nitrate secretion into the xylem sap was reduced in _PROTEIN_ . to complement our observation that the xylem sap nitrate concentration increased in the _PROTEIN_ mutant we measured xylem sap nitrate concentrations in mutant lines of a different _PROTEIN_ transporter the allelic _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in which intact _PROTEIN_ mrna was undetectable . consistent with our hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have opposite functions less nitrate accumulated in xylem sap of _PROTEIN_ mutant plants compared with the wild type control supporting that _PROTEIN_ functions to load nitrate into the xylem .
