pattern recognition receptors trigger innate immune responses in animals and plants . one such prr is the flagellin receptor _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . here we demonstrate that a functional fusion of _PROTEIN_ to the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ resides in cell _LOCATION_ of most tissues . stimulation with the flagellin epitope induces its transfer into intracellular mobile vesicles followed by degradation . _PROTEIN_ internalization depends on _LOCATION_ and proteasome functions and receptor activation . a variant _PROTEIN_ mutated in thr a potential phosphorylation site binds normally but is impaired in responses and _PROTEIN_ endocytosis . we propose that plant cells regulate pathogen associated molecular pattern _PROTEIN_ mediated prr activities by subcellular compartmentalization .
we transformed the arabidopsis ecotype ws an _PROTEIN_ mutant with a construct encoding _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ with a myc linker under the control of its native promoter _METHOD_ . transgenic lines exhibited _PROTEIN_ of the full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein . transgenic _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and endogenous _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ with similar abundance . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ restored normal specific binding in ws and the whole array of full responses as lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ myc only . thus the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein is biologically equivalent to native _PROTEIN_ in every respect making it perfectly suited for localization studies . confocal microscopy revealed that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was _PROTEIN_ in roots rosette leaves _METHOD_ and flower _PROTEIN_ and that it was localized at the cell periphery . in leaves _PROTEIN_ occurred in mesophyll and epidermal cells as well as in the guard cells lining the stomata the possible entry sites for invading bacteria . obviously plants are constantly ready to detect flagellin and thus to trigger an immediate early defense response upon a bacterial invasion . in _PROTEIN_ it has been demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ plays a role in the first line of host defense . plasmolysis experiments showed a retraction of the _METHOD_ signal associated with the cell _LOCATION_ and with hechtian strands . this is consistent with the function of _PROTEIN_ as a surface receptor recognizing an _LOCATION_ ligand and is in agreement with its _PROTEIN_ structure and biochemical ligand binding studies . interestingly senescent leaves did not exhibit _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we next tested the effect of the ligand on _PROTEIN_ localization . young rosette leaves were preincubated in water for min treated with and then subjected to confocal microscopy . within min of treatment the _METHOD_ signal disappeared from the cell _LOCATION_ . instead numerous distinct _METHOD_ labeled vesicles occurred underneath the cell _LOCATION_ both in epidermal cells and in mesophyll cells . prolonged incubation led to a complete loss of the _METHOD_ signal suggesting disappearance of the internalized _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein . similarly a pulse treatment with for min followed by intense washing and a further incubation for min revealed the occurrence of intracellular vesicles . however within min the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal in the cell _LOCATION_ was almost back to its original level . thus upon withdrawal of the cell _LOCATION_ was replenished with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . this replenishment was completely blocked by cycloheximide indicating that it was based on de novo protein synthesis rather than vesicle recycling . we suggest that _PROTEIN_ upon interaction with an agonist active ligand is subject to degradation via endocytosis and lysosomal and/or proteasomal pathways . furthermore we addressed the specificity of induced _PROTEIN_ internalization . the inactive variant derived from the sequence of agrobacterium tumefaciens flagellin did not affect _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization . in addition the antagonistic peptide failed to induce _PROTEIN_ internalization and interestingly a slight increase of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ cell _LOCATION_ signal could be observed . it is possible that the binding of an antagonist inhibits a constitutive turnover/recycling mechanism . a simultaneous treatment of and at the same concentration led to _METHOD_ signals in cell _LOCATION_ and intracellular vesicles as expected in view of the competitive behavior of the two peptides . no accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in vesicles was observed when leaves were incubated with the peptide elicitor a _PROTEIN_ recognized by a different receptor . since the responses to and are almost identical _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ internalization is not due to cellular changes such as ion fluxes or the formation of ros induced by _PROTEIN_ in general but strictly depends on binding of the ligand . to further characterize the phenomenon of induced _PROTEIN_ internalization we tested a series of different inhibitors . treatment with each of the inhibitors alone did not affect _PROTEIN_ cell _LOCATION_ localization . it has been demonstrated in yeast and mammalian cells that actin plays an important role during receptor mediated endocytosis and we actually observed intracellular movement of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labeled vesicles rapidly trafficking along cytoplasmic strands . we found that oryzalin a well known inhibitor of tubulin polymerization and latrunculin b an inhibitor of actin depolymerization strongly reduced the appearance of induced _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ vesicles . thus _LOCATION_ components are important for _PROTEIN_ endocytosis per se possibly through dynamin like proteins . they function in most endocytic processes in animals and have also been found in plants . post _LOCATION_ derived vesicles are known to be affected by brefeldin a . in bfa pretreated leaves addition induced the appearance of _METHOD_ vesicles . to further examine the nature of these vesicles we used wortmannin which is thought to inhibit fusion of prevacuolar compartments . application of in the presence of wortmannin failed to induce the appearance of _METHOD_ vesicles indicating that these vesicles arise from a wortmannin sensitive endocytic process . moreover low temperature was also found to inhibit triggered _PROTEIN_ internalization . endocytosis has been well studied in yeast and mammalian cells while its very occurrence in plants was doubtful for many years . however during the past years it has become clear that endocytosis takes place in plants even in fully turgescent guard cells . it has been _PROTEIN_ studied in developmental processes such as cytokinesis and root hair and root tip growth as well as stomata closing . during plant growth and development various processes are regulated by _PROTEIN_ transport of the phytohormone auxin which is mediated by a _PROTEIN_ distribution of the auxin efflux carrier _PROTEIN_ through its trafficking from endosomal compartments . auxin itself has been shown to negatively regulate _PROTEIN_ endocytosis . only recently endocytosis of surface receptors has been also discovered in plants . however internalization of the _PROTEIN_ type hormone receptors brassinosteroid insensitive _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ associated receptor kinase _PROTEIN_ appeared independent of ligand addition and occurred constitutively . in contrast we demonstrate here that _PROTEIN_ internalization is triggered specifically by binding of its ligand and requires receptor activation . thus it represents the first case of ligand mediated receptor endocytosis in plants . induced _PROTEIN_ endocytosis is further followed by receptor degradation . this suggests in contrast to early types of endosomes recycling _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins that activated _PROTEIN_ is eventually sorted into _PROTEIN_ endosomal compartments referred to as multivesicular bodies . nevertheless a much slower constitutive form of turnover of _PROTEIN_ might occur as well since treatment with the antagonistic peptide slightly increased the _METHOD_ signal of cell _LOCATION_ localized _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ indicating that this peptide which prevents signaling of _PROTEIN_ also stabilizes it in the _LOCATION_ . autophosphorylation has been shown to play a crucial role in animal rtk activation and also occurs in several plant _PROTEIN_ including _PROTEIN_ . in order to study the role of protein phosphorylation in receptor kinase endocytosis we used k which acts as a general kinase inhibitor and was shown to inhibit elicitor responses . in the presence of k induced _PROTEIN_ endocytosis was completely abolished . thus _PROTEIN_ internalization requires kinase activities possibly that of its own serine/threonine kinase . we next conducted site directed mutagenesis of potential phosphorylation sites in the cytoplasmic part of _PROTEIN_ and assayed their function in binding and response by transformation of ws plants . threonine and serine residues were selected for mutational analysis based on their high conservation among several _PROTEIN_ . transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ similar amounts of mutant _PROTEIN_ protein were chosen for further functional characterization . among five different threonine and serine residues tested we could identify three _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ that abolished induced immediate generation of ros . two mutations _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ also strongly affected downstream signaling since seedling growth was not inhibited in the presence of nm . a partial seedling growth inhibition by was observed in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines . only _PROTEIN_ was capable of mediating a full response . unlike the described mutations _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ all mutations even those impaired in responses exhibited clear binding . one of the identified residues _PROTEIN_ was located in the juxta _LOCATION_ region of _PROTEIN_ a region known to be phosphorylated in _PROTEIN_ and to be important in rtk function by creating docking sites for recruitment of downstream molecules . moreover _PROTEIN_ resembles _PROTEIN_ which has been identified as in vivo phosphorylation site . therefore _PROTEIN_ was further investigated in detail . transgenic ws plants were found to exhibit the same binding characteristics as ws plants . however these lines were insensitive at concentrations that induce a strong response in wild type plants . in addition they also displayed an enhanced disease susceptibility phenotype upon infection with pathogenic pseudomonas syringae bacteria . microscopic analysis of ws transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ a _METHOD_ tagged version of _PROTEIN_ showed normal cell _LOCATION_ localization of the mutant _PROTEIN_ protein . clearly the impairments in the response of ws plants are not a result of _PROTEIN_ subcellular mislocalization in the absence of elicitor . however upon addition _PROTEIN_ endocytosis was strongly reduced and only observed as a delayed rare event . therefore mutation of the threonine residue hampered both _PROTEIN_ internalization and _PROTEIN_ response indicating that both processes are intimately connected . for surface receptor endocytosis ligand binding induces receptor kinase activation and phosphorylational and conformational changes that lead to the exposition of sorting motifs recognized by _LOCATION_ proteins . classically the tetrapeptide functions as a sorting signal in animal receptors . although this motif can be found in plant _PROTEIN_ and prrs it is not present in _PROTEIN_ . instead in the _PROTEIN_ cytoplasmic part there is a well conserved pest like motif which has been implicated in ubiquitin triggered receptor endocytosis . further evidence for a possible _PROTEIN_ ubiquitination comes from our gene _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ analysis . among rapidly induced genes are several coding for _PROTEIN_ zinc finger proteins with potential ligase activities . ligases have been reported to regulate tlrs . furthermore ligand induced receptor ubiquitination is important for their endocytic sorting into lysosomes and finally degradation . interestingly lysosomal receptor degradation appears to be regulated by the proteasome . inhibition of the proteasomal activity affects the uptake of internalized receptors from outer _LOCATION_ of mvbs into small inner vesicles that will fuse with the lysosome . eventually internalized receptors can recycle back to the cell _LOCATION_ . trafficking of the epidermal growth _PROTEIN_ receptor to mvbs requires sorting signals within the cytoplasmic tail and also function of an ubiquitin ligase . studies using proteasome inhibitors revealed that not only _PROTEIN_ degradation but also the internalization step were strongly compromised by and lnll . this suggests that the proteasome activity primarily influences _PROTEIN_ endocytosis and rather indirectly its degradation as has been described for rtks . therefore we are currently addressing the involvement of the pest motif in the mechanism of _PROTEIN_ endocytosis and introduced a single amino acid exchange within the _PROTEIN_ pest like motif . preliminary results of ws transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ this _PROTEIN_ mutant variant revealed that _PROTEIN_ endocytosis was impaired . intriguingly these plants were strongly compromised in their response as assayed by mediated inhibition of seedling growth . in contrast immediate early induced ros production appeared to be much less affected . these data provide evidence that _PROTEIN_ endocytosis and downstream signaling might be regulated through its pest like motif possibly involving ubiquitin ligase activities . the most studied model of ligand mediated receptor internalization is the egf receptor in mammals . egf binding accelerates egfr rapid endocytosis which is followed by sorting and trafficking through a series of endosomal compartments . egfr directed into mvbs results in their lysosomal degradation and therefore in signal termination . however the rate of receptor internalization appears to be much higher than the rate of receptor degradation . this _PROTEIN_ together with other observations provides evidence that rtks can signal from endosomes . similarly _PROTEIN_ is internalized and likely further subjected to protein degradation which occurs much slower than its internalization and substantial pools of initially activated _PROTEIN_ receptor accumulate inside the cell . thus there is a clear possibility that _PROTEIN_ can signal from intracellular compartments for example through interaction with mapk cascades . because all triggered responses display a transient behavior we postulate that this characteristic could be achieved through _PROTEIN_ internalization . here we show for the first time that a plant cell _LOCATION_ receptor in its function recognizing a bacterial _PROTEIN_ exhibits ligand induced internalization . our results with the _PROTEIN_ mutant provide evidence that endocytosis and signaling function are coupled . however whether _PROTEIN_ internalization is in _PROTEIN_ required for signaling needs to be further evaluated . what is clear instead is that _PROTEIN_ is subject to protein degradation after endocytosis . this implies a host cell mechanism to dispose activated prrs thereby down regulating signaling capacity . attenuation of _PROTEIN_ mediated prr signaling in animals occurs _PROTEIN_ through interactions with negative regulators . it has been reported that uncontrolled hyperinduction of proinflammatory cytokines by tlrs may play a role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune chronic inflammatory and infectious diseases . therefore especially during immune responses tailoring of pathogen induced signaling is important to ensure both effective defense and host survival .
