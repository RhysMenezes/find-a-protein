the _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ gene has an important role in freezing tolerance in arabidopsis thaliana . we show that homologous genes are present and _PROTEIN_ in a wide range of terrestrial plants including species not able to tolerate freezing . _PROTEIN_ constructs derived from the cdnas of a number of different plant species including examples not tolerant to freezing are able to complement the freezing sensitivity of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ mutant . in arabidopsis the _PROTEIN_ protein is localized to the chloroplast outer envelope _LOCATION_ as revealed by the analysis of transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusions to _METHOD_ by confocal microscopy and by the immunological analysis of isolated chloroplasts treated with thermolysin protease . moreover the chloroplasts of the _PROTEIN_ mutant show clear evidence of rapid damage after a freezing episode suggesting a role for _PROTEIN_ in the protection of the chloroplast .
initial analysis of est sequences in the ncbi database indicated that numerous species potentially produce _PROTEIN_ like proteins . these est clones were from a wide range of plant species including both _METHOD_ representing dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous species as well as _METHOD_ . we chose a representative set from which to isolate full length cdna clones . examples were selected from a gymnosperm as well as from both dicotyledonous and moncotyledonous species . included in this set are species _PROTEIN_ as freezing sensitive as well freezing tolerant examples . in the case of o. sativa we were able to confirm the gene sequence using information from the rice genome project . analysis of the proteins encoded by the isolated cdnas showed a high degree of similarity between all of the selected proteins . homology was strongest in the central region of the protein . the active site peptide motifs are fully conserved in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and and only differ in and _METHOD_ by the substitution of ile or val respectively for thr in the tfnep motif . the n and c termini of the proteins are more divergent however the n terminus carries a stretch of amino acids at position in _PROTEIN_ which is perfectly conserved in all _PROTEIN_ like sequences . the similarity of the _PROTEIN_ like proteins to the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ protein and the conservation of the active site motifs suggest that the catalytic function is likely to be conserved . in order to assess the phylogenetic relationships of _PROTEIN_ like proteins we carried out searches of the sequenced genomes of simple plant species . analysis of the genome sequences of the eukaryotic alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii and the oxygenic prokaryote gloeobacter violaceus identified genes with the potential to encode proteins with only weak similarity to _PROTEIN_ whereas the genomes of the red algae cyanidioschyzon merolae and the marine diatom thalassiosira pseudonana did not contain genes with the potential to produce _PROTEIN_ like proteins . the genes identified in c. reinhardtii and g. violaceus were more similar to other members of the arabidopsis glycosidase gene family than they were to the _PROTEIN_ gene indicating that they were unlikely to represent _PROTEIN_ like genes . previous phylogenetic analysis has demonstrated that the _PROTEIN_ protein is uniquely divergent from other members of the gene glycosidase gene family in arabidopsis . a recent characterization of glycosidases in rice has also demonstrated that the relevant _PROTEIN_ like gene has low sequence similarity to other glycosidases in this species and is more similar to the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ gene . phylogenetic analysis of putative _PROTEIN_ like proteins shows that they form a distinct clade and that they are different from both the other arabidopsis glycosidases and the most similar proteins encoded by a number of sequenced simple plant genomes . the lack of a homologous sequence within the cyanobacteria and simple plant species suggests that the _PROTEIN_ gene is not likely to be derived from the endosymbiotic bacterial genome associated with the development of the chloroplast . the presence of genes encoding proteins with high similarity to the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ in species that are not freezing tolerant suggests a role for the protein that is separate from its putative function in freeze protection . an obvious question is whether _PROTEIN_ like genes from freezing sensitive species are able to complement the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ mutation . in order to test this cdna clones encoding the _PROTEIN_ like proteins from g. max o. sativa and p. taeda were cloned into a plant _PROTEIN_ vector where their _PROTEIN_ was mediated by the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . these constructs were used to transform the _PROTEIN_ t dna tagged allele which has previously been shown not to produce _PROTEIN_ protein . surprisingly the _PROTEIN_ like sequences from both freezing tolerant and freezing sensitive species were able to functionally complement the freezing sensitivity lesion in arabidopsis . no differences either qualitative or quantitative were observed with _PROTEIN_ to the ability of constructs from different species to complement the _PROTEIN_ phenotype . an interesting aspect of the _PROTEIN_ phenotype is that leaf order dependent freezing sensitivity which is found in wild type arabidopsis is preserved . as with wild type plants younger leaves and meristematic regions are more able to resist freezing than mature leaves in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . in _PROTEIN_ at temperatures below the whole plant including the meristematic region is killed whereas at more moderate freezing temperatures the younger leaves and meristematic regions usually survive the freezing regime even though mature leaves are killed and the plant is able to recover . nevertheless the temperature at which damage is caused to both young and mature tissues of _PROTEIN_ is higher when compared with wild type plants . at freezing temperatures below _PROTEIN_ plants are killed whereas only the mature leaves of wild type plants are damaged . as proof that the glycosidase activity of the _PROTEIN_ protein is required for freeze protection an active site knock out was engineered by site directed mutagenesis . the _PROTEIN_ residue in _PROTEIN_ which acts as the acid/base catalyst in the substrate hydrolysis reaction and belongs to the highly conserved peptide motif tfnep of the active site of family glycosidases was altered to a _PROTEIN_ . glycine a small uncharged amino acid located in the active site pocket is unlikely to modify the _PROTEIN_ or quaternary structure of _PROTEIN_ . citation previously demonstrated the applicability of this method when precisely defining the function of the glu residue in the tfnep active site of agrobacterium _PROTEIN_ . the full length _PROTEIN_ construct with _PROTEIN_ driven by the promoter was transformed into _PROTEIN_ mutant and its _PROTEIN_ was verified using anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . the construct was not able to complement the freezing sensitivity whereas a construct identical except for the _PROTEIN_ mutation was able to complement freezing sensitivity . this suggests that glycosidase activity is essential for the freezing tolerance role of the arabidopsis protein and presumably also for the other _PROTEIN_ like proteins able to complement the freezing lesion . in order to investigate a possible role for _PROTEIN_ the intracellular localization of the protein was investigated using _METHOD_ constructs . in silico analysis suggested the presence of an n terminal signal peptide targeting the protein to the secretory pathway whereas proteomics based investigations have identified the _PROTEIN_ protein in the chloroplast outer envelope fraction of both arabidopsis and pisum sativum . using gateway technology a clone comprising a full length copy of the _PROTEIN_ gene fused to _METHOD_ was constructed with the clone under the transcriptional regulation of the promoter . this clone was used to generate stable transformants in wild type arabidopsis and the two available _PROTEIN_ mutants the original mutant carrying a point mutation _PROTEIN_ and the t dna tagged allele _PROTEIN_ . both mutant alleles of _PROTEIN_ were complemented by this construct and their freezing tolerance was restored . the intracellular localization of the tagged protein was investigated using confocal microscopy . control constructs showed the soluble _METHOD_ to have a cytoplasmic location . by contrast the tagged _PROTEIN_ protein confirming the proteomics based studies showed a pattern associated with localization to the chloroplast envelope . no differences in the localization of _PROTEIN_ were observed when wild type or mutant plants were transformed or when warm or cold grown plants were examined . _METHOD_ was most easily detected in the chloroplasts within stomatal guard cells . interestingly an unusual phenotype was associated with transformation using the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct the chloroplasts appear bunched together . this aggregation of chloroplasts _METHOD_ to be a product of the _METHOD_ construct as _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ protein alone directed by the same promoter did not lead to such a chloroplast phenotype . it is possible that the addition of _METHOD_ causes the c terminal region to face into the _LOCATION_ where _METHOD_ _METHOD_ interactions cause aggregation of the chloroplasts . to further investigate the mechanism of targeting of the _PROTEIN_ protein to the chloroplast we investigated whether the n terminal region is sufficient to target a passenger protein to the organelle . a new construct in which only the first n terminal amino acids of the _PROTEIN_ protein were fused to _METHOD_ showed the same chloroplast envelope localization pattern . _METHOD_ was considerably stronger than with the full length _PROTEIN_ construct and aggregation of chloroplasts was less pronounced . the localization was again specific to the chloroplast envelope suggesting that the n terminal region of _PROTEIN_ is sufficient to direct the protein to this location . in order to confirm the localization of _PROTEIN_ and to establish its position in the chloroplast envelope system we used immunoblot analysis with purified chloroplasts and an anti _PROTEIN_ antibody directed against the c terminus of the _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ . this confirmed the localization of _PROTEIN_ to the purified chloroplast fraction . treatment of the isolated chloroplasts with thermolysin protease before analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ is partially sensitive to the protease and produced a band of reduced size . this implies that the _PROTEIN_ protein is localized in the chloroplast outer envelope _LOCATION_ and that its c terminus which is recognized by the antibody is protected from digestion by its integration into or across the _LOCATION_ where thermolysin can not penetrate . thermolysin digestion of in vitro translated _PROTEIN_ protein shows that in the absence of such native _LOCATION_ association _PROTEIN_ is fully susceptible to thermolysin and that the protected fragment of the native protein is not the result of a protease resistant domain . the similar molecular weight of the in vitro synthesized protein to the endogenous _PROTEIN_ protein in chloroplasts suggests that there is no significant post translational modification of the protein and that there is unlikely to be a cleavable targeting sequence . control western blots using localized to the intermembrane space and two outer envelope proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed that the protease behaved as expected in these experiments . the localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein to the chloroplast outer envelope suggested a possible role in the protection of the chloroplast . in order to investigate this possibility transmission electron microscopy was used to investigate cellular damage in _PROTEIN_ . comparison of cold acclimated plants showed no differences between _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants . material collected from plants h after their removal from freezing conditions showed clear differences between wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants . cells of wild type plants were not different in appearance to those before freezing and chloroplasts had a normal appearance . the cells of _PROTEIN_ however were clearly damaged . the tonoplast appeared disrupted and chloroplasts were present throughout the cell volume . examination of the chloroplasts showed that they were damaged although _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ could be seen they were loosely packed within the chloroplast . it is clear that h after removal from freezing conditions cells of _PROTEIN_ are badly damaged as are the chloroplast of these cells . in order to obtain a clearer picture of the nature of the damage in _PROTEIN_ further examinations were carried out on plants just h after removal from freezing conditions . many cells were already similar in appearance to those observed after h with damaged chloroplasts dispersed throughout the cell volume . however there were cells that clearly had damaged chloroplasts but still appeared to have an intact tonoplast that restricted the chloroplasts to the periphery of the cell . this suggests that the earliest signs of damage are to the chloroplast and that chloroplast damage is not a product of the release of the _LOCATION_ contents following tonoplast damage . tonoplast disruption may be a result of direct contact with the compromised chloroplast envelope or occur through the release of toxic components from the damaged chloroplast . these early indications of chloroplast damage suggest a putative role for the _PROTEIN_ protein in the protection of this organelle .
