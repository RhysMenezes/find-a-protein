we have identified a novel protein on the outer _LOCATION_ of arabidopsis thaliana mitochondria . this protein displays sequence identity with the kda translocase of the outer envelope _LOCATION_ of chloroplasts . a mitochondrial localisation for this protein was determined by its presence in the proteome of highly purified arabidopsis mitochondria western blot analysis with antibodies to from pea that indicate its presence in arabidopsis and pea mitochondria green _METHOD_ protein fusion proteins that indicate an exclusive mitochondrial localisation for this protein and _PROTEIN_ profiles in various tissue types and during development that are more similar to translocase of the outer mitochondrial _LOCATION_ components than to chloroplastic toc components . thus arabidopsis mitochondria contain a protein with high sequence identity to a _LOCATION_ protein import receptor .
a proteomic and bioinformatic approach to identify components of the mitochondrial import apparatus confirmed the presence of proteins that we previously predicted to be present based on sequence similarity to components of the yeast mitochondrial import apparatus . in this analysis we identified two peptides that were derived from an arabidopsis homologue on chromosome . this annotation is based on high sequence identity with the previously characterised from pea . no other toc or translocase of the inner envelope _LOCATION_ of chloroplasts components were identified in our proteomic analysis . we have previously demonstrated that a two percoll gradient purification of arabidopsis cell culture mitochondria yields an intact mitochondrial fraction with as little as _LOCATION_ contamination as determined by measuring alkaline pyrophosphatase activity a marker for _LOCATION_ . three genes in arabidopsis display high amino acid sequence identity with the previously identified pea iii displays the highest identity of v displays identity and i displays identity . the v protein had a predicted molecular _METHOD_ of kda and hydropathy plot analysis indicated that it has a hydrophobic stretch of approximately amino acids at the n terminal end . from pea is known to be anchored in the _LOCATION_ by the n terminal end . a hydrophobic region at the n terminal end is also predicted in iii which has a predicted molecular _METHOD_ of kda . i differs from the other two _METHOD_ in that it contains amino acids has a predicted molecular _METHOD_ of kda and does not appear to have a hydrophobic region at the n terminal end . like pea and arabidopsis iii v is also predicted to contain three tetratricopeptide domains . for clarity we will now refer to arabidopsis v as _PROTEIN_ to indicate its mitochondrial location . we carried out western blot analysis with antibodies to pea pea _PROTEIN_ and arabidopsis to further investigate the presence of _PROTEIN_ in mitochondria . we used purified pea chloroplasts pea mitochondria and arabidopsis mitochondria . antibodies to pea yielded a strong band with all three samples . a strong band was apparent in proteins separated from pea chloroplasts but a distinct band was also detected in proteins separated from pea and arabidopsis mitochondrial preparations . immunoreactivity of the same organellar preparations with antibodies raised against _PROTEIN_ produced a distinct signal with pea chloroplasts as expected but yielded a negative result in arabidopsis mitochondria . the very weak signal for _PROTEIN_ in pea mitochondria is probably because these mitochondria are only purified through a single percoll gradient while the arabidopsis mitochondria are purified through two percoll gradients . immunoreactivity of the three preparations with an antibody raised to from arabidopsis produces a strong band in arabidopsis mitochondria a distinct but weaker band in pea mitochondria and no band in pea chloroplasts . to define the subcellular location of the three homologues in arabidopsis we made gene fusions linking _METHOD_ to the end of the cdnas . transient transformation of cultured soybean cells with these chimeric products was performed to determine subcellular localisation . we linked the targeting signal of soybean _PROTEIN_ to _METHOD_ as a control for mitochondrial localisation . the subcellular localisation of iii and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ chimeric products gave distinct but different _METHOD_ patterns . the iii _METHOD_ appeared in large organelles in diameter and low in number . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was observed in numerous small punctate organelles that were similar in distribution and number to those observed when the _PROTEIN_ targeting signal was linked to _METHOD_ . i yielded a different _METHOD_ pattern and did not appear to be targeted to any organelle rather it appeared to accumulate in the _LOCATION_ . on the basis of this result we concluded that _PROTEIN_ was targeted to mitochondria which is consistent with its detection in the mitochondrial fraction and western blot analysis while iii appears to be targeted to chloroplasts . we also carried out western blot analysis on protease treated mitochondria with antibodies to _LOCATION_ cytochrome c the uncoupling protein _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and . was digested upon protein kinase treatment with intact mitochondria as was the cross reacting band with the antiserum . however the intermembrane space inner _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ marker proteins were not digested . on the basis of these results we propose that the _PROTEIN_ protein is exposed on the outer mitochondrial _LOCATION_ . in order to determine if _PROTEIN_ displayed a similar _PROTEIN_ profile to either tom or toc components we examined the _PROTEIN_ of the three genes from arabidopsis and compared them to the _PROTEIN_ of and _PROTEIN_ which we had previously examined . i and iii showed high _PROTEIN_ levels in green tissues namely cotyledons and leaves . in contrast _PROTEIN_ was most highly _PROTEIN_ in root tissue . interestingly i and iii exhibited similar _PROTEIN_ patterns to those measured for the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ components and _PROTEIN_ a _LOCATION_ gene encoding a _LOCATION_ ribosomal protein . in contrast the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ profile was similar to those observed for mitochondrial located proteins in particular _PROTEIN_ and . thus the transcript abundance profile of _PROTEIN_ had a similar _PROTEIN_ profile to the mitochondrial rather than the chloroplastic import receptor apparatus .
