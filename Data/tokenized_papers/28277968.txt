_PROTEIN_ vascular plant one zinc finger _PROTEIN_ have an ability to bind to the specific cis element in the _PROTEIN_ promoter of arabidopsis which function on the _PROTEIN_ dependent flowering and possibly in various stress responses as potential transcription _PROTEIN_ although _LOCATION_ localization of voz proteins is still unclear . in this study we found that _PROTEIN_ is dispersed throughout the cytoplasm under normal growth conditions whereas _PROTEIN_ is transferred not only to the _LOCATION_ but also to the cytoplasmic foci under heat stress conditions . the _PROTEIN_ foci predominantly co localized with a marker of stress granules which were cytoplasmic granular structures for mrna storage and decay under abiotic stress conditions . we also demonstrated that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with a _LOCATION_ localization signal was rapidly degraded via the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway under the heat stress conditions . also stress related _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant was significantly upregulated by heat stress as compared with that in the wild type arabidopsis . our results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is localized to sgs and _LOCATION_ under heat stress conditions and functions as a transcriptional repressor of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis .
we previously reported that the _PROTEIN_ double mutant shows higher sensitivity to high temperature conditions suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are involved in heat stress responses . since we previously reported that around is a critical temperature of thermotolerance of arabidopsis nakai y nakahira y sumida h takebayashi k nagasawa y yamasaki k akiyama m ohme takagi m fujiwara s shiina t et al . vascular plant one zinc finger protein transcription _PROTEIN_ regulate abiotic and biotic stress responses in arabidopsis . plant j pmid http we decided to set as the heat stress temperature in this study . to explore the function of vozs under heat stress conditions we first examined the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ by immunostaining with an anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . as shown in fig . _PROTEIN_ was found to be dispersed throughout the _LOCATION_ under normal growth conditions but _PROTEIN_ localization was dramatically changed to both the _LOCATION_ and cytoplasmic granular structures after the seedlings were incubated at for h. next we observed the dynamics of the changes in the localization of _PROTEIN_ under heat stress by means of transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ a translational fusion of _PROTEIN_ with green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter or its promoter and we found that the distribution of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was changed to the _LOCATION_ foci after min of heat stress treatment . then the _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ foci gradually _PROTEIN_ after h of heat stress treatment at . the formation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ foci was apparently delayed for min at or min at . we analyzed the degradation kinetics of _PROTEIN_ by western blotting with the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . two week old wt seedlings were incubated at and then were collected at time points and subjected to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ followed by western blotting with the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . in line with the changes of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the high temperature conditions _PROTEIN_ was not degraded until h of high temperature incubation but this protein was gradually degraded after h of incubation . next we investigated where the _PROTEIN_ protein is _PROTEIN_ degraded in the cell under the high temperature conditions using the plants _PROTEIN_ a fusion protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with either a _LOCATION_ export signal or a _LOCATION_ localization signal . _LOCATION_ resident _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was slightly degraded after h of incubation at whereas _LOCATION_ localized _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was rapidly degraded under the high temperature conditions and the protein almost disappeared after h of incubation . the degradation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ nls was completely inhibited by the addition of a proteasome inhibitor mg suggesting that the _LOCATION_ localized voz protein is rapidly degraded by the proteasome system . heat stress treatment induced granule structures of _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ . in eukaryotic cells granular structures that form in the _LOCATION_ are referred to as sgs or p bodies . in plants sgs and p bodies are known to be formed under various stressful conditions including heat oxidative stress uv irradiation and translation inhibition . zawoznik _METHOD_ groppa ml tomaro _PROTEIN_ benavides _PROTEIN_ . endogenous salicylic acid potentiates cadmium induced oxidative stress in arabidopsis thaliana . plant science http we speculated that the _PROTEIN_ foci formed under the heat stress conditions were associated with sgs or p bodies . to confirm that _PROTEIN_ colocalizes with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ pomeranz mc hah c lin pc kang sg finer jj blackshear pj jang jc . the arabidopsis tandem zinc finger protein _PROTEIN_ traffics between the _LOCATION_ and cytoplasmic foci and binds both dna and rna . plant physiol pmid http marker proteins of sgs and p bodies respectively we generated transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of the promoter . under normal temperature conditions both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were dispersed throughout the _LOCATION_ whereas after the incubation at the cytoplasmic granular structures of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were formed after min under the high temperature condition and the types of granular structures merged completely . in contrast _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ foci were partially merged with the p body marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ after the heat stress treatment . from these results we concluded that the _PROTEIN_ protein is associated _PROTEIN_ with sgs and partially with p bodies under heat stress conditions . next to determine whether _PROTEIN_ is one of the essential components of sg assembly or disassembly under heat stress we analyzed changes in the number of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signals of arabidopsis seedlings in the wt or _PROTEIN_ background . _PROTEIN_ foci were induced not only in wt but also in the _PROTEIN_ background under heat stress . no statistically significant differences in the formation rate and the number of the granule structures were observed between plants with the wt and _PROTEIN_ background . after h recovery at from min of the heat stress treatment _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ foci were completely disappeared and the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were dispersed throughout the _LOCATION_ not only in wt but also in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background . from these results we concluded that _PROTEIN_ is not essential for processes of assembly or disassembly of sgs . to determine how high temperature affects the _PROTEIN_ of voz proteins we measured the levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in wt and _PROTEIN_ plants by real time qrt pcr . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels were reduced dramatically under the high temperature conditions . in contrast _PROTEIN_ of a drought and heat stress responsive transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was significantly enhanced in _PROTEIN_ plants compared with the wt under the high temperature conditions . note that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was already suppressed even in the non heat stress conditions . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ protein function as transcriptional repressors of _PROTEIN_ not only under heat stress but also non heat stress conditions .
