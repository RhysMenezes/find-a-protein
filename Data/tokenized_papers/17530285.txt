hexokinase a hexose phosphorylating enzyme has emerged as a central enzyme in sugar sensing processes . a few hxk isozymes have been identified in various plant species . these isozymes have been classified into two major groups _LOCATION_ isozymes located in the _LOCATION_ stroma and those containing a _LOCATION_ anchor domain located _PROTEIN_ adjacent to the mitochondria but also found in the _LOCATION_ . of all the hexokinases that have been characterized to date the only exception to this rule is a spinach type b hxk that by means of subcellular fractionation has been localized to the outer _LOCATION_ of _LOCATION_ . however has a _LOCATION_ anchor domain that is almost identical to that of the other type b hxks . to determine the localization of enzyme by other means we _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein in tobacco and arabidopsis protoplasts and compared its localization with that of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein that shares a similar n terminal _LOCATION_ anchor domain . _METHOD_ is localized adjacent to the mitochondria similar to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and all other previously examined type b hxks . proteomic analysis had previously identified _PROTEIN_ on the outside of the mitochondrial _LOCATION_ . we therefore suggest that enzyme is located adjacent to the mitochondria like the other type b hxks that share the same n terminal _LOCATION_ anchor domain .
the n terminal _LOCATION_ anchor domain of is very similar to those of the mitochondria associated hxks _PROTEIN_ and . nevertheless biochemical studies suggested that is located on the outer _LOCATION_ of chloroplasts . to determine the intracellular localization of by other means we _PROTEIN_ a fusion protein of _METHOD_ in tobacco protoplasts and compared its localization to that of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . as shown in fig . both _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are associated with the mitochondria similar to _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . a _METHOD_ fusion protein from a construct containing bp of the untranslated region of was also associated with the mitochondria following _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts indicating that there is no alternative start codon that could be responsible for dual or _LOCATION_ targeting of . in addition a fusion protein containing the first amino acids of fused to a truncated protein of _PROTEIN_ was also associated with the mitochondria . these observations contradict the results obtained through subcellular fractionation and _LOCATION_ isolation which suggested that is attached to the outer _LOCATION_ of the chloroplast envelope . in an earlier fractionation study an association between hxk and the outer chloroplast envelope was also suggested but the authors cautioned that their results did not preclude the possibility that this hexokinase had become attached to the chloroplasts during _LOCATION_ isolation . we suspect that these contrasting results could be the result of the _LOCATION_ fraction having been contaminated with other cellular _LOCATION_ that are associated with the mitochondria . although the _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ fusion studies were performed using chimeric proteins we believe that the results of these studies are reliable as they do not contradict the mitochondrial associations of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which have been observed through proteomic analysis . intensive proteomic analysis of arabidopsis chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ did not reveal any hexokinase chloroplast envelope associations further supporting our results . the localization of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which appears in the database as a chloroplast outer envelope hexokinase has no experimental support while its n terminal sequence is very similar to that of _PROTEIN_ and implying mitochondrial association . hence none of the hxk isozymes deduced from the numerous hxk genes cloned so far seem to be located on the outer _LOCATION_ envelope . mounting evidence suggests that hxks may be located in the stroma within _LOCATION_ or associated with the mitochondria . the only exception to this is a single monocot that lacks the n terminal _LOCATION_ anchor domain and was localized in the _LOCATION_ . a small fraction of the mitochondria associated hxk isozymes are probably transported to the _LOCATION_ where they regulate the _PROTEIN_ of various genes involved in the sugar signaling pathway . it has been suggested that the primary function of _PROTEIN_ located on the outer _LOCATION_ of the chloroplast might be to directly phosphorylate _PROTEIN_ leaving the chloroplasts in order to _PROTEIN_ a steep gradient of _PROTEIN_ across the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . however maltose is probably the _PROTEIN_ starch degradation product exported from the chloroplasts and therefore hxk might not be required to _PROTEIN_ a steep _PROTEIN_ gradient . in addition to hxk which can phosphorylate both _PROTEIN_ and fructose plants also possess a few fructokinase isozymes that can phosphorylate only fructose . while the affinities of hxks to _PROTEIN_ are about two orders of magnitude higher than their affinities to fructose the affinities of frks to fructose are higher than those of hxks . it is therefore likely that while frks phosphorylate only fructose hxks phosphorylate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . unlike hxks the cytoplasmic frks lack _LOCATION_ anchor domains and are located in the _LOCATION_ . this spatial separation of hxks and frks in the cytoplasm raises interesting points concerning micro compartmentalization of the hexoses _PROTEIN_ and fructose . _PROTEIN_ can be obtained through cleavage of sucrose by apoplastic invertase or intracellular soluble invertase or following amylolytic degradation of starch in _LOCATION_ . fructose may also be produced through the cleavage of sucrose by invertase or by intracellular _LOCATION_ sucrose synthase but can not be obtained through starch degradation in _LOCATION_ . hence except as products of invertase activity intracellular _PROTEIN_ and fructose might have different origins and potentially different micro compartmentalization patterns . the recent discoveries of invertases located within the mitochondria and _LOCATION_ of rice and sucrose synthase in the mitochondria of maize further support micro compartmentalization of _PROTEIN_ and fructose . how the different hexoses _PROTEIN_ and fructose are routed to the mitochondria associated _LOCATION_ hxks or to the cytoplasmic frks remains a mystery . by harnessing the power of the recently developed genetically encoded intracellular _PROTEIN_ sensors we may be able to greatly expand our knowledge in this field .
