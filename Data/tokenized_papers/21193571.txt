sodium potassium root _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ encodes a soluble metal binding protein that is specifically _PROTEIN_ in companion cells of the phloem . the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype includes high na k rb and starch accumulation in leaves short roots _PROTEIN_ flowering and _PROTEIN_ long distance transport of sucrose . using traditional and dna microarray based deletion mapping a bp deletion was found in an exon of _PROTEIN_ that introduced a premature stop codon . the mutant phenotypes were complemented by transformation with the native gene or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusions driven by the native promoter . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was mobile in the phloem it moved from companion cells into sieve elements and into a previously undiscovered symplasmic domain in the root meristem . grafting experiments revealed that the high na accumulation was due _PROTEIN_ to loss of _PROTEIN_ function in the leaves . this supports a role for the phloem in recirculating na to the roots to limit na accumulation in leaves . the onset of root phenotypes coincided with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ after germination . the _PROTEIN_ short root phenotype was due primarily to a _PROTEIN_ cell division rate in the root meristem indicating a role in root meristem _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the phloem .
in previous work an arabidopsis fast neutron induced mutant was identified based on differences in elemental composition in leaves as determined by inductively coupled _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis . when first isolated the mutant showed a complex phenotype with high li mg k as and low mn compared with the wild type . after backcrossing twice to col a single recessive allele was resolved that resulted in high na k and rb accumulation in leaf tissue . the mutant and col plants were grown under various soil conditions and the high na and k phenotypes were consistently observed . figures to show results from a typical experiment in which plants were grown under conditions described by citation . the mutant accumulated around threefold higher na and twofold higher k and rb compared with col . the mutant also showed defects in primary root growth . therefore we named the mutant _PROTEIN_ for sodium potassium root defective . a mapping population was created after backcrossing _PROTEIN_ once to col the mutant was crossed with landsberg _LOCATION_ and progeny with short primary roots were selected . the primary root growth defect in _PROTEIN_ is illustrated in figure . using pcr based mapping _PROTEIN_ was localized within a region of kb at the top of chromosome . to identify the mutation dna microarray based deletion mapping was used . genomic dna was prepared from two populations _PROTEIN_ and hybridized to arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ arrays . a single deletion of bp was identified within _GENE_ which caused a frame shift mutation and premature truncation of the c terminal amino acids . transformation of _PROTEIN_ with a bp genomic construct containing a bp promoter and untranslated region all the exons and introns and nucleotide sequence after the stop codon complemented the root growth defects as well as the na k and rb overaccumulation phenotypes . this confirmed the identity of the _PROTEIN_ gene . four t dna insertion lines with insertions in the _PROTEIN_ promoter region or downstream of the coding region _PROTEIN_ were examined however none displayed a phenotype . _PROTEIN_ is predicted to encode a soluble protein of amino acids with a heavy metal associated domain of amino acids at the c terminal end . no similarity was found between the n terminal region of _PROTEIN_ and proteins of known function . two arabidopsis proteins of unknown function share high sequence similarity with _PROTEIN_ in the c terminal domain _PROTEIN_ is identical and _PROTEIN_ is identical at the amino acid level . these show lower similarity to _PROTEIN_ in the n terminal domain _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the hma domain is found in all _METHOD_ in proteins that transfer/bind heavy metals including small metallochaperones heavy metal transporters and enzymes that use heavy metals as cofactors . the conserved sequence l xcxxc is believed to be a cu binding site in which the two cys residues coordinate metal directly this motif was also observed in transport proteins that specifically transport ni and hg . the hma domain of _PROTEIN_ shares and identity with arabidopsis cu chaperones _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . the homolog in yeast _PROTEIN_ has been well characterized and found to be involved both in cu homeostasis by specifically delivering cu to heavy metal p type _PROTEIN_ and in defense against oxidative stress . when overexpressed in a yeast strain lacking the superoxide dismutase gene both at _PROTEIN_ and at _PROTEIN_ can protect the mutant from active oxygen toxicity in a cu dependent manner . in our experiments _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ or the c terminal region alone failed to complement the reactive oxygen toxicity phenotype of yeast mutant indicating that the hma domain of _PROTEIN_ functions differently than at _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ when _PROTEIN_ in yeast . to test for possible metal binding _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli as a fusion to maltose binding protein . the purified mbp _PROTEIN_ fusion protein is shown in figure . the identity of the purified mbp _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was confirmed by _METHOD_ analysis . forty unique peptides were detected covering of the fusion protein sequence . several heavy metals were detected in the purified protein sample using icp _METHOD_ analysis . higher zn cu fe ni and co was associated with the mbp _PROTEIN_ fusion protein compared with the mbp control . the molar ratio of protein to metals was around indicating that _PROTEIN_ is a metal binding protein . a mutated version of the _PROTEIN_ whole gene construct in which two conserved cys residues in the hma domain were changed to gly failed to complement the _PROTEIN_ short root and _PROTEIN_ flowering phenotypes . this indicates that metal binding is essential for _PROTEIN_ function in the plant . to study the _PROTEIN_ pattern a whole gene _PROTEIN_ fusion _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in col and independent transformants were analyzed . no gus staining was found in embryos or imbibed seeds . at d after germination gus staining was observed in of the seedlings . gus activity was found in the vasculature of the root hypocotyl junction and to a lesser extent in the hypocotyl . at dag gus activity was found in the vascular tissue throughout the seedling . in more mature plants strong gus staining was found in vascular tissue in rosette and cauline leaves . in floral tissue gus staining was _PROTEIN_ localized to the sepals and the filaments of the flowers and the pedicel of the siliques . cross sections of roots and leaf petioles revealed _PROTEIN_ in the phloem region of the vasculature but not in the xylem . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was previously reported to be companion cell specific . this is based on microarray results and cdna library analysis of mrna transcripts isolated from purified companion cell protoplasts _LOCATION_ or isolated phloem tissue . in the work by citation _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was among the top transcripts most enriched in companion cell _LOCATION_ . furthermore _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis and shown to label companion cells specifically . in our experiments _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ driven by the _PROTEIN_ promoter labeled _LOCATION_ within the phloem of roots confirming the results of citation . in the root tip _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was found only within the phloem . sieve plates stained with aniline blue were identified in the sieve element adjacent to cells containing _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in _LOCATION_ . this _METHOD_ that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in companion cells . a whole gene _METHOD_ fusion _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ complemented the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotypes indicating that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein is functional . confocal microscopy was performed on the generation seedlings . within the root _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was found in two parallel cell files on either side of the xylem within the vasculature indicating phloem localization . at the root tip _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in cells proximal to the zone of cell division in both primary and _PROTEIN_ roots . _METHOD_ was apparent in both the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . since _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene is specific to companion cells our results indicate that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein is mobile through pd into sieve elements and is unloaded into some cells of the root meristem . as a control _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in seedlings of the same age transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was analyzed . _PROTEIN_ is specifically _PROTEIN_ in companion cells and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in the phloem and within two cell layers surrounding the phloem in the mature region of roots as previously reported . free _METHOD_ diffused through the symplast into the whole root meristem . compared with free _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was more restricted to the phloem in mature roots . this is similar to results for multiple soluble _METHOD_ fusions of to kd analyzed by citation . compared with free _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mobility in the root tip was more restricted . to test whether _PROTEIN_ protein mobility was essential for its function _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gus was used to transform _PROTEIN_ . the larger size of _PROTEIN_ gus compared with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was expected to limit _PROTEIN_ gus mobility through pd . of primary transformants showed full complementation of both root defects and the _PROTEIN_ flowering phenotype . the high na k and rb phenotype of the mutant was also complemented . gus staining patterns in the complemented lines were similar to the _PROTEIN_ pattern described in col background plants . this indicated that the postphloem trafficking of _PROTEIN_ protein within the root meristem may not be essential for the function of _PROTEIN_ in root growth . based on the result that _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ specifically within the phloem region a detailed characterization of the vasculature of col and the _PROTEIN_ mutant was performed . the general pattern of cell layers within the vasculature of _PROTEIN_ was normal . based on the results of transmission electron microscopy no difference in subcellular structure was detected for _PROTEIN_ compared with col in the mature phloem region . the phloem specific gene altered phloem development _PROTEIN_ is essential for _PROTEIN_ phloem cell identity . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was used to study phloem cell identity as the fusion protein specifically labels companion cells and developing protophloem/metaphloem cells . no difference was detected in the _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in col and _PROTEIN_ plants indicating that the phloem differentiation process proceeded normally in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the accumulation of starch in leaves of the mutant was analyzed as a test for phloem function . previous work has shown that reduced phloem loading leads to starch accumulation in leaves . leaves of short day grown plants were collected at the beginning and end of the day and stained with solution . in the _PROTEIN_ mutant excess starch was retained at the end of the night . starch was quantified during the h light/dark cycle showing that _PROTEIN_ accumulated around fourfold more starch in leaves compared with the wild type during the day . by the end of the following dark period of the starch remained in _PROTEIN_ compared with undetectable amounts of starch in col . when the plants were kept in continuous darkness for d leaf starch in the wild type _PROTEIN_ completely while _PROTEIN_ retained leaf starch even after h of darkness . when plants were illuminated for h following h of continuous darkness the starch accumulation rate was twice as high in the mutant compared with col . this indicated that the starch overaccumulation phenotype was caused by a higher accumulation rate during the day and a _PROTEIN_ ability to deplete leaf starch during the night . considering that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in companion cells it was likely that the starch excess phenotype of _PROTEIN_ was caused by a defect in phloem loading or translocation . to test this possibility sucrose translocation from source to sink was analyzed in _PROTEIN_ and col . plants were grown in turface to facilitate access to the root system . a aliquot of sucrose was applied to wounded fully expanded rosette leaves . plants were then incubated for min to allow translocation . after dissection and drying the plants were exposed to x ray film for d. as shown in the autoradiographs in both _PROTEIN_ and col radioactivity is present in the labeled leaf . in col radioactivity was translocated to the root system . however no radioactivity was observed in the root system of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the results indicate that the _PROTEIN_ mutant is defective in phloem loading or translocation . to begin to analyze how the _PROTEIN_ defect in phloem translocation was related to the na and k accumulation phenotypes reciprocal grafts were made between _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants . the working hypothesis was that if a defect in phloem loading caused na and k accumulation in leaves then plants with mutant shoots grafted to wild type roots would show high na and k accumulation similar to the mutant . grafted and control plants were grown in turface . self grafting did not affect the visible phenotype of the plants _PROTEIN_ shoots grafted to _PROTEIN_ roots produced plants with small root and shoot structures similar to nongrafted _PROTEIN_ mutants growing in the same conditions . when col shoots were grafted to _PROTEIN_ roots the plants produced larger shoot architecture with short roots indicating that the defect in root growth was caused by loss of _PROTEIN_ function in the roots . leaf k and na levels were tested for all the grafted combinations using icp _METHOD_ analysis . the self grafted _PROTEIN_ and col plants displayed k and na accumulation similar to the control _PROTEIN_ mutants and col respectively . this indicates the grafting per se had little effect on k and na accumulation . mutant shoots grafted to wild type roots showed leaf na levels similar to that of the mutant . plants with wild type shoots grafted to mutant roots also showed na content in leaves higher than the wild type although lower than in mutant plants . the results indicate that high na in _PROTEIN_ is caused _PROTEIN_ by loss of _PROTEIN_ function in the shoot and that loss of _PROTEIN_ in the roots also contributes . the k levels of mutant shoot/wild type root plants and wild type shoot/mutant root plants were intermediate between the self grafted mutant and wild type plants . however mutant shoot/wild type root plants still had higher k in leaves than did the wild type shoot/mutant root plants . these results suggest that the k accumulation phenotype was also caused by both root and shoot defects however the effect of loss of _PROTEIN_ in the shoot predominated . similar results were obtained when the different grafted types and control plants were grown in soil . to test the effect of root k /na uptake on their accumulation in the shoot xylem sap was collected from col and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants grown in the same soil conditions and k and na concentrations were analyzed by icp _METHOD_ . similar na concentrations were detected in _PROTEIN_ and col xylem samples and lower k concentration was detected in the xylem sap samples of _PROTEIN_ plants than in those of col plants . these results indicated k /na overaccumulation in the shoot tissue of _PROTEIN_ was not caused by increased na /k uptake from the mutant roots or increased k /na concentration within the xylem sap . _PROTEIN_ showed a severe root growth phenotype shortly after germination that involved short primary roots and increased _PROTEIN_ root growth . when grown on normal _PROTEIN_ plates for week the primary root length of _PROTEIN_ seedlings was of that of the wild type roots . the size of the _PROTEIN_ root meristem region _PROTEIN_ dramatically during the first dag as determined by analysis of propidium iodide stained roots using confocal microscopy . in comparison meristem size remained more stable in wild type seedlings and a _PROTEIN_ in the number of meristematic cells does not occur in wild type arabidopsis until to weeks after germination . the elongation zone of _PROTEIN_ seedlings at dag was typically reduced to three cells in length . the length of fully elongated cortex cells was also measured . _PROTEIN_ had a smaller cell length than the wild type . thus the short roots of _PROTEIN_ were the result of both fewer cells in the root and a smaller cell size . to determine whether the root meristem defects originated from an abnormality in embryo development embryos of different stages were dissected from developing seeds of _PROTEIN_ and col . no obvious differences between the wild type and _PROTEIN_ were found in early embryo stages . this result was supported by the finding that _PROTEIN_ seeds can germinate normally on both plates and soil as well as by gus staining results showing that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ only after germination . the root meristem defect in seedlings was investigated using a quiescent center marker starch accumulation in root columella cells and the _PROTEIN_ of cyclin gus _PROTEIN_ in the root apical meristem . compared with col _PROTEIN_ seedlings showed much lower _PROTEIN_ of quiescent center marker at dag . at dag _PROTEIN_ seedlings showed a similar cyclin gus _PROTEIN_ pattern as the wild type however by dag the number of cells _PROTEIN_ cyclin gus in the root apical meristem _PROTEIN_ significantly in some _PROTEIN_ roots compared with the wild type . within the first dag no difference was detected in starch accumulation within root columella cells . from dag starch accumulation in the outermost columulla cell layer disappeared in _PROTEIN_ roots as a result only three layers of columella cells exhibited starch accumulation compared with four layers in the wild type roots . abnormality of starch accumulation in _PROTEIN_ root columella cells is consistent with defects in quiescent center cells . however no sign of differentiation in _PROTEIN_ columella stem cells was detected as revealed by the absence of stainable starch granules within the columella stem cell layer in _PROTEIN_ . the growth of primary roots within col and _PROTEIN_ mutants was recorded for the first weeks after germination . clear differences between col and _PROTEIN_ root growth was not observed until dag when primary roots grew at a slower but constant rate . these results suggest that defects in the _PROTEIN_ root apical meristem occurred at to dag . in the early stage of vegetative growth _PROTEIN_ rosette leaves appeared at the same rate as in the wild type . _PROTEIN_ leaves were slightly smaller and had shorter petioles than those of col . after the wild type plants bolted _PROTEIN_ mutants continued to form new rosette leaves displaying a _PROTEIN_ flowering phenotype . in arabidopsis several different pathways promote floral induction . the autonomous pathway responds to endogenous signals at specific developmental stages . the photoperiod and vernalization pathways respond to environmental stimuli such as light and temperature . the gibberellin pathway plays a relatively independent role in floral transition under noninductive photoperiods . among these pathways the photoperiod pathway is largely dependent on phloem activity since the signals induced by photoperiod _PROTEIN_ and its downstream target flowering locus t _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ in the vasculature and the mobile flowering signal _PROTEIN_ needs to be transported through the phloem to the meristem . the floral transition times of _PROTEIN_ and col were measured under different floral promotion conditions . in long day conditions wild type plants began to bolt at dag after forming rosette leaves _PROTEIN_ mutants required d to bolt and by that time rosette leaves had developed . _PROTEIN_ and col bolted at similar times in short day conditions . wild type plants took d to bolt whereas _PROTEIN_ plants took d to bolt . the effects of vernalization and _PROTEIN_ treatment were also tested . both treatments accelerated flowering in _PROTEIN_ although in both conditions the mutant plants still required slightly more time to bolt . therefore _PROTEIN_ mutants were affected _PROTEIN_ in the photoperiod pathway . this is consistent with a phloem defect in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . in addition to extended vegetative growth _PROTEIN_ also showed elongated reproductive growth and _PROTEIN_ senescence phenotypes . abundant flowers were made in this period but the early flowers set seeds poorly . the _PROTEIN_ stem displayed loss of apical dominance in both short and long day conditions and the floral meristem in the primary shoot died before producing any flowers . the same phenomenon also appeared in the floral _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ branches .
