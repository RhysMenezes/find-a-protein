plant _PROTEIN_ domain proteins are known to be involved in the epigenetic control of gene _PROTEIN_ during plant development . here we report that the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ domain protein _PROTEIN_ contributes to the epigenetic regulation of pollen tube growth thus affecting fertilization . using an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion construct the chromosomal localization of _PROTEIN_ was established in tobacco by cells . in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ knockout showed reproductive defects . tissue specific _PROTEIN_ analyses indicated that _PROTEIN_ is the major related gene _PROTEIN_ in the pollen . immunological analyses demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ was involved in the methylation of histone in the inflorescence and pollen grains . the significant reduction in the amount of methylated histone and in _PROTEIN_ pollen vegetative _LOCATION_ resulted in suppression of pollen tube growth . our results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is capable of modulating the _PROTEIN_ of genes that function in the growth of pollen tube by methylation of specific lysine residues of the histone in the vegetative _LOCATION_ .
the amino acid sequence and domain organization of _PROTEIN_ is presented in a . protein domain predictions using the pfam database indicated that amino acids encode a phd finger whereas a _PROTEIN_ domain corresponds to amino acids . the presence of an nls may suggest that _PROTEIN_ is targeted to the _LOCATION_ . the _PROTEIN_ domain is associated with chromosomal proteins that regulate gene _PROTEIN_ . phd finger domains on the other hand have been proposed to be involved in complex formation or recognition of _LOCATION_ targets related to chromatin structure and regulation . the protein domain organization displayed by _PROTEIN_ is characteristic of motifs commonly found in transcription _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is classified under the class of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ domain proteins . to show its homology to amino acid sequence alignment of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domain was performed against the _PROTEIN_ domains of from other _METHOD_ such as human drosophila and mouse . the _PROTEIN_ domain from human trithorax _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was included in the alignment in order to demonstrate the presence of conserved motifs among _PROTEIN_ domain containing proteins . in addition to this the protein has the highest similarity to trx among other _PROTEIN_ domain proteins . the gwg motif and cysteine rich regions were shown to be conserved among the and trx proteins after amino acid sequence alignment by clustalw . accordingly previously characterized plant phd finger proteins were also aligned with the phd finger of _PROTEIN_ . among them are arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ from zea mays and _METHOD_ from arabidopsis . the conserved _PROTEIN_ motif for phd finger is highlighted in c. the results of the amino acid sequence alignment suggest that _PROTEIN_ possesses the conserved residues also found in other functional proteins and can serve as basis for predicting the _PROTEIN_ function . using time lapse video microscopy the dynamic association of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with tobacco by chromosomes was established _PROTEIN_ . actively dividing tobacco by cells overexpressing _PROTEIN_ with a c terminal _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were monitored and the _METHOD_ signal was shown to be _PROTEIN_ localized in the chromatin during interphase and throughout mitosis . illustrates the localization pattern of _PROTEIN_ at different stages of cell division . at interphase a strong _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected in the entire _LOCATION_ except the nucleolar area . as the chromatin started to condense the _METHOD_ signal was shown to be associated with the condensing chromatin starting prometaphase . strong _METHOD_ signals on highly compacted chromosomes were observed during metaphase . as the cells reach anaphase the separation of _METHOD_ signals on each of the chromosome sets was evident and immediately after that dynamics of the _METHOD_ signal is consistent with the complete separation and movement of the chromatids to opposite sides of the cells at telophase . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of the chromatin was evident until the cells reach cytokinesis . tobacco by cells overexpressing _PROTEIN_ with an n terminal _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed exactly the same localization pattern as that of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the correlation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to chromosomes during cell division and the presence of both the _PROTEIN_ and phd finger domains in _PROTEIN_ provide considerable information for the possible involvement of _PROTEIN_ in chromatin remodeling . the results of rt pcr analysis using _PROTEIN_ and actin primers are presented in a . _PROTEIN_ was shown to be _PROTEIN_ at high levels in mature flowers and flower buds at relatively equal amounts indicating that _PROTEIN_ is likely to be _PROTEIN_ throughout the different stages of arabidopsis flower development . detectable _PROTEIN_ was also observed in day old seedlings . furthermore increasing the number of pcr cycles to detected _PROTEIN_ transcripts from the other organs analyzed such as roots _METHOD_ and leaves . to facilitate the observation of tissue specific _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis in situ hybridization to floral tissues was carried out using an _PROTEIN_ antisense probe . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was monitored at different stages of flower development . _PROTEIN_ transcripts were below detection levels in early floral primordia . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the stamen primordia was first detected among stage flowers . accumulation of _PROTEIN_ transcripts was observed within anther locules of flowers at stage and along anther walls and pollen grains in a stage flower bud . the level of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was found to be almost the same in the _PROTEIN_ and medial stamens . slightly detectable levels of _PROTEIN_ transcripts were also observed in the stamen filaments indicating that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in the entire stamen structure . arabidopsis microarray data on the tissue specific _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was obtained from genevestigator and indicated that _PROTEIN_ is highly _PROTEIN_ in the pollen . furthermore the _PROTEIN_ of two other arabidopsis related genes and three homologs were also obtained from genevestigator . comparing the signal intensities for _PROTEIN_ of these six genes in pollen it was shown that the high _PROTEIN_ in pollen is exclusive for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the average signal intensity value for _PROTEIN_ was found to be whereas less than for the other five genes . this excludes the possibility of redundancy in _PROTEIN_ function as a major protein that acts as a histone methyltransferase in arabidopsis pollen . in order to identify the possible function of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis development a homozygous mutant line harboring a t dna insertion was characterized . the predicted site of t dna insertion for salk on the first exon of the _PROTEIN_ gene was confirmed by pcr and sequence analysis . the t dna insertion greatly reduced the level of _PROTEIN_ transcripts as analyzed by rt pcr . however longer unexpected transcripts could be detected in open flowers of _PROTEIN_ mutants by northern hybridization using a dna probe _PROTEIN_ . although the transcript level increases three to five times these transcripts might have been transcribed together with the t dna insertion by the _PROTEIN_ promoter and spliced from the long premature rna . these transcripts can not produce the functional _PROTEIN_ protein since they lack an inframe initiation codon . upon inspection of the vegetative organs in these _PROTEIN_ homozygous plants no apparent morphological abnormalities were observed except that the rate of bud production was lower than the wild type . the presence of a t dna insertion in the first exon of the _PROTEIN_ gene is expected to disrupt the _PROTEIN_ of the functional domains in the _PROTEIN_ protein such as the phd and _PROTEIN_ domains . previous reports on the roles played by _PROTEIN_ containing and/or phd containing proteins include the regulation of flower development . recently identified phd containing arabidopsis proteins such as _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ were shown to function in anther and pollen development . thus male meiosis and pollen development were analyzed in _PROTEIN_ flowers . however pollen from flowers of the homozygous plants did not show any significant morphological difference when compared to the wild type pollen . mature pollen from both wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutants contain two sperm _LOCATION_ and one vegetative _LOCATION_ as visualized by dapi staining . likewise meiotic chromosomes from the _PROTEIN_ homozygous line appeared morphologically the same as that of the wild type _PROTEIN_ . though pollen development was normal in _PROTEIN_ mutants the _PROTEIN_ that significant amount of _PROTEIN_ transcripts were found in the pollen indicates that _PROTEIN_ function is concerned with processes taking place in the pollen . after germination the pollen grows a tube that is used to deliver the sperm cells in order to reach the female gametophyte for fertilization . thus we tried to investigate the role of _PROTEIN_ in the reproductive development in arabidopsis . a general observation on the silique length among _PROTEIN_ mutants gave us an impression that mutant siliques appeared slightly shorter than that of the wild type . silique length measurements were done on the first five siliques found in each stem and our analysis indicated that _PROTEIN_ siliques are about mm shorter in average than that of wild type . furthermore fresh siliques were dissected for analysis of ovule development . the _PROTEIN_ siliques were found to contain unfertilized ovules and aborted seeds . the number of unfertilized ovules and aborted seeds was counted in both wild type and _PROTEIN_ siliques and was found to vary widely among _PROTEIN_ siliques even within the same plant _PROTEIN_ . however wild type siliques contained very few unfertilized ovules and almost no aborted seeds . clearing of intact siliques showed clearly that the number of healthy seeds contained in _PROTEIN_ siliques is lower than in the wild type . the increased number of unfertilized ovules in _PROTEIN_ compared to wild type indicates that fertility is affected by _PROTEIN_ knockout . furthermore the increased variations in the number of unfertilized ovules indicate that this phenotype is most likely due to epigenetic changes in gene _PROTEIN_ . several genes _PROTEIN_ in the pollen play vital roles in assuring that fertilization can take place successfully . three independent studies on the global gene _PROTEIN_ in the arabidopsis pollen have shown that the pollen contain genes that _PROTEIN_ function in signaling cell wall metabolism and cytoskeletal dynamics . these gene families are expected to be involved in pollen germination pollen tube growth and guidance . alteration in the _PROTEIN_ level of these genes can drastically influence the success or failure of fertilization . _PROTEIN_ being a _PROTEIN_ domain transcription _PROTEIN_ has a potential for regulating gene _PROTEIN_ through chromatin remodeling specifically by methylation of specific lysine residues . the _PROTEIN_ domain of _PROTEIN_ is most similar in homology to drosophila . the specific enzymatic activity established for drosophila includes methylation of and and recently _PROTEIN_ . histone methyltransferase assays were performed for recombinant _PROTEIN_ proteins but in vitro activities were not detected . this indicates that like some _PROTEIN_ domain methyltransferase proteins _PROTEIN_ requires association with other proteins in a complex in order to carry out its enzymatic activities . thus the level of methylated histones in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant flowers were analyzed by immunoblotting with specific anti methyl antibodies . in the _PROTEIN_ mutant line a significant reduction in the level of dimethylated trimethylated and trimethylated _PROTEIN_ was evident _PROTEIN_ . on the other hand the dimethylated _PROTEIN_ level was only slightly reduced in the _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ . this ability of _PROTEIN_ to methylate the lysine residue of histone is in agreement with the reported enzymatic activity of proteins in both human and drosophila . proteins are chromatin remodelers specifically acting on and . in drosophila transcriptional activation by corresponds to methylation of lysines and in and lysine in at the promoter of target genes . furthermore it was demonstrated that is responsible for all in vivo histone methylation in drosophila and that the _PROTEIN_ domain alone is sufficient for its histone methyltransferase activity . a recent report by provides evidence that histone is specifically methylated by mammalian and drosophila . this histone specific methyltransferase activity was demonstrated in arabidopsis by the homolog _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was shown to have a specific activity to methylate of histone in order to activate the _PROTEIN_ of flowering locus c _PROTEIN_ . considering these characteristic methylation activities of different proteins so far characterized we can rationalize that _PROTEIN_ transcriptional activation involves methylation of histone and . the significantly high _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ in pollen prompted us to analyze histone methylation levels in pollen grains by _METHOD_ staining using antibodies against specific methylation marks . the antibodies used for pollen immunostaining detected the tissue specific histone protein localized exclusively in the vegetative _LOCATION_ . all methylation marks were clearly immunolocalized in the vegetative _LOCATION_ of wild type pollen . in _PROTEIN_ pollen the dimethyl and trimethyl _PROTEIN_ signals in the vegetative _LOCATION_ were greatly reduced whereas the other methylation marks were not affected . this methylation pattern is consistent with the immunoblotting results pointing to a transcriptional activation mode of histone modification by _PROTEIN_ . histone proteins are generally categorized into three replication dependent replication independent and tissue specific . in lily tissue specific histone variants such as and were reported to be specifically localized in the generative cells of pollen grains . moreover the male gamete specific histone in lily has been shown to possess a promoter that is activated independent of vegetative cell transcriptional and translational machineries . more recently a histone variant _PROTEIN_ was shown to be particularly _PROTEIN_ in the vegetative _LOCATION_ of lily pollen . it was also demonstrated that this histone _PROTEIN_ variant was preferentially incorporated into chromatin where it is expected to control chromatin condensation and upregulate genes that are necessary for pollen germination and tube growth . meanwhile histone genes have been identified in arabidopsis by a bioinformatic approach including one that is a male gamete specific variant . has studied the dynamics of this male gamete specific _PROTEIN_ through live imaging of the fertilization process in arabidopsis thaliana . the histone protein we detected here is specifically localized in the vegetative _LOCATION_ and is distinct from the male gamete specific _PROTEIN_ previously described by . the _LOCATION_ of the vegetative cell is said to be more transcriptionally active than that of the generative cell since numerous pollen specific genes that function in pollen germination and tube growth are _PROTEIN_ in the vegetative cell . in contrast genes that function in protein destination and signal transduction were found to be abundant in the generative cell of lily pollen . since we detected histone methylation in the vegetative _LOCATION_ we then tried to analyze pollen germination as well as pollen tube growth in _PROTEIN_ mutants . the rate of pollen germination did not differ between wild type and _PROTEIN_ . however the growth of pollen tube was affected in _PROTEIN_ in which most of the _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes did not reach the normal length as in wild type even after h of incubation . wild type pollen tubes have an average length of about whereas homozygous _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes reached about in length . the distribution plot in k shows that the measured pollen tube lengths for heterozygous mutants cover the range of tube length values for both wild type and homozygous _PROTEIN_ pollen with the longer pollen tubes lengths comparable to that of wild type and shorter pollen tubes similar to that of _PROTEIN_ homozygous mutants . dapi staining allowed us to visualize the vegetative and sperm _LOCATION_ during pollen development and to track the _LOCATION_ along the pollen tube after germination . in _PROTEIN_ mutants the sperm and vegetative _LOCATION_ remained in the pollen grain whereas all these _LOCATION_ were located near the tip of wild type pollen tube as if ready to be delivered out into the ovules . the defect in pollen tube growth among _PROTEIN_ mutants resulted to failure of the sperm cells to reach the ovules for fertilization thus numerous ovules remained unfertilized . based on these findings we conclude that _PROTEIN_ is capable of regulating the pollen tube growth in arabidopsis by altering the _PROTEIN_ of pollen specific genes via histone methylation . to validate such conclusions we performed microarray experiments to analyze gene _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mutant flowers . the microarray data we obtained were assigned the geo accession number . _PROTEIN_ presents the genes downregulated by _PROTEIN_ mutation . in the list several genes involved in cell wall metabolism stress response and transport as indicated by database annotations were found to have _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mutants . genes involved in cell wall synthesis are also implicated in pollen tube growth such as pectinesterases and _PROTEIN_ transferases . for the upregulated genes those involved in transcription stress response and signal transduction showed increased _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mutant flowers _PROTEIN_ . we also found _PROTEIN_ as an upregulated gene with about three times increased transcription as compared to that in the wild type . this is consistent with our observation that the longer transcripts of _PROTEIN_ were detected by northern hybridization . in both cases genes with increased or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels were detected which are assumed to be associated with pollen development especially affecting pollen tube growth . thus from these findings it can be deduced that the downregulation of genes involved in pollen tube growth was due to the absence of _PROTEIN_ . histone modification is a major _PROTEIN_ that controls the chromatin state in many _METHOD_ which subsequently affects gene _PROTEIN_ and development . the current paper presents novel findings that arabidopsis related protein _PROTEIN_ is involved in histone modifications of and _PROTEIN_ which are associated with the transcriptionally active chromatin state . a significant reduction in the level of methylated histone and may have contributed to the observed defects in pollen tube growth which subsequently affected fertility in _PROTEIN_ mutants . the _PROTEIN_ of genes that function in the growth of pollen tubes most likely those involved in cell wall metabolism and signal transduction were suppressed _PROTEIN_ by the significant reduction or loss of histone and levels in the _PROTEIN_ pollen . as a result the sperm _LOCATION_ failed to reach the embryo sac thus producing unfertilized ovules . the histone modification alteration shown in _PROTEIN_ mutants is consistent with those for drosophila and mammalian proteins thereby providing a link between animal and plant _METHOD_ in _METHOD_ of epigenetic development . this work paves the way for further investigations on the mechanism by which hmtase regulates _PROTEIN_ of genes that are key players in plant reproduction .
