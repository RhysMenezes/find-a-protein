plant nadph dependent glyoxylate/succinic semialdehyde reductases and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are considered to be involved in detoxifying harmful aldehydes thereby preserving plant health during exposure to various abiotic stresses . phylogenetic analysis revealed that the two glyr _METHOD_ appeared in the plant lineage prior to the divergence of the chlorophyta and streptophyta which occurred approximately million years ago . green _METHOD_ protein fusions of apple rice and arabidopsis thaliana heynh glyrs were transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco suspension cells or arabidopsis protoplasts as well in methoxyfenozide induced stably transformed arabidopsis seedlings . the localization of apple _PROTEIN_ confirmed that this isoform is _LOCATION_ whereas apple rice and arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ were localized to both mitochondria and _LOCATION_ . these findings highlight the potential involvement of glyrs within distinct compartments of the plant cell .
the deduced amino acid sequences of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have identity across species of viridiplantae which is comprised of chlorophytic species including both unicellular and multicellular algae as well as charophytic and embryophytic plants . these sequences were used to construct a phylogenetic tree . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins from the embryophyta generated two distinct clusters with a relatively high degree of sequence identity within each cluster _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . a small clade with a high degree of identity _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is dedicated to monocotyledonous plants within each cluster . most of the embryophytic genomes contain both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes the notable exceptions being cucumis sativus and c. melo which lack _PROTEIN_ but apparently have two _PROTEIN_ located in tandem on the same chromosome . the two _PROTEIN_ in c. sativus and c. melo which were designated as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are identical . furthermore in silico analysis of subcellular localization using targetp _PROTEIN_ and wolf psort revealed that these cucurbit _PROTEIN_ like their arabidopsis apple and rice counterparts possess a putative n terminal mitochondrial/chloroplastidial targeting sequence whereas the cucurbit _PROTEIN_ do not . physcomitrella patens klebsormidium flaccidum chlamydomonas reinhardtii and volvox carteri contain both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins . however other members of the chlorophyta contain only a single glyr with identity to . phylogenetic analysis of plant glyr amino acid sequences across plant species . the unrooted phylogenetic tree was depicted using the maximum likelihood method in . the red blue and green bars represent species in the embryophyta charophyta and chlorophyta respectively . the numbers at each node represent support values obtained by a bootstrap test using replicates _PROTEIN_ . the tree is drawn to scale with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree . the protein ids for the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are given in supplementary tables . overall we found that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ appear in the plant lineage prior to the divergence of the chlorophyta and streptophyta which occurred approximately million years ago . notably only a single glyr is found in the oldest members of the chlorophyta examined and the number of glyr proteins has not expanded during evolution of the streptophyta . thus the _PROTEIN_ orthologs probably arose from the duplication of a single glyr type protein in the chlorophyta which underwent functional diversification . also an extinction event followed by duplication probably occurred after the divergence of the cucurbitaceae resulting in subfunctionalization of the _PROTEIN_ proteins _PROTEIN_ . have identified six important amino acid residues for catalysis _PROTEIN_ and substrate binding _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and protein sequence alignment of the glyrs studied here revealed a general conservation of these catalytic and substrate binding residues with only two exceptions . c. reinhardtii _PROTEIN_ lacks both catalytic residues whereas c. variabilis _PROTEIN_ lacks suggesting that the majority of the glyrs investigated here are indeed functional . interestingly single glyrs also appear in the bacterial lineage and these possess greater identity to the plant _PROTEIN_ than the _PROTEIN_ . based on conservation of all the plant catalytic and substrate binding residues it _METHOD_ likely that these glyrs would also prefer glyoxylate over _PROTEIN_ as substrate but further study is required to substantiate such a prediction . apple rice and arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ lack a predicted n terminal organelle targeting signal and are therefore considered to be _LOCATION_ . indeed while was previously thought to contain a c terminal tripeptide sequence _PROTEIN_ similar to the type peroxisomal target signal _PROTEIN_ motif recent experimental evidence indicates that the protein is localized exclusively to the _LOCATION_ and not to _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . both and lack a c terminal _PROTEIN_ like peroxisomal targeting signal and are therefore presumed to be also exclusively _LOCATION_ . compared to their _PROTEIN_ counterparts most higher plant _PROTEIN_ examined to date _PROTEIN_ possess n terminal extensions of varying lengths and are generally predicted to be localized to _LOCATION_ rather than to mitochondria _LOCATION_ by various subcellular localization prediction _METHOD_ . a mitochondrial specific prediction program such as mitoprot _PROTEIN_ predicts mitochondrial localization for all three _PROTEIN_ whereas another mitofates _PROTEIN_ predicts mitochondrial localization for rice _PROTEIN_ only . however dualpred a program specific for dual targeting to mitochondria and _LOCATION_ predicts that and but not localize to both organelles . moreover is annotated at the arabidopsis subcellular proteome database _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to be localized to _LOCATION_ however this latter conclusion was drawn solely from _METHOD_ _METHOD_ studies involving isolated _LOCATION_ but not mitochondrial organellar fractions . in order to begin to assess the subcellular localization of glyrs in vivo mdglyr _METHOD_ fusion proteins were transiently _PROTEIN_ and visualized via _PROTEIN_ in tobacco suspension cultured by cells serving as a well established model system for protein subcellular localization studies . similar to the abovementioned previous results for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ displayed diffuse localization throughout the cell similar to co _PROTEIN_ cherry a red _METHOD_ protein that served as a _LOCATION_ marker protein . by contrast _METHOD_ localized to distinct globular shaped structures which co localized with the co _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ marker fusion protein consisting of the subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex fused to cherry indicating that similar to previous results for is localized to _LOCATION_ . however _METHOD_ in the majority of by cells examined localized also to numerous small puncta that did not co localize with co _PROTEIN_ pdcpl cherry but did co localize with the endogenous mitochondrial protein cytochrome oxidase subunit ii . taken together these data suggest that _METHOD_ is localized to both _LOCATION_ and mitochondria in by cells . similar results were observed for _METHOD_ . these findings also prompted us to revisit the subcellular localization of which had not been assessed for mitochondrial localization in our previous study . as shown in figures _METHOD_ localized to both co _PROTEIN_ pdcpl cherry containing _LOCATION_ as well as to endogenous coxii containing mitochondria . subcellular localization of mdglyrs in tobacco

system or perhaps a distinct cell type we generated stably transformed arabidopsis seedlings _PROTEIN_ methoxyfenozide inducible _METHOD_ . the presence of the _METHOD_ transgene was confirmed via gene specific pcr amplification and the _PROTEIN_ of as assessed by quantitative pcr was observed to be approximately four times higher in transgenic seedlings induced with methoxyfenozide for and h than in non treated wild type control seedlings or similarly treated wt seedlings all of which displayed relatively low levels of _METHOD_ . furthermore allied control experiments revealed that no _METHOD_ attributable to _METHOD_ was observed in wt seedlings in the presence or absence of methoxyfenozide due to bleed through from endogenous chlorophyll _METHOD_ or mitotracker staining or in _METHOD_ transformed seedlings in the absence of methoxyfenozide induction . however upon induction _METHOD_ localized consistently to both _LOCATION_ and mitochondria based on the co localization of the fusion protein with chlorophyll _METHOD_ and mitotracker staining respectively corroborating results for the dual localization of _METHOD_ in tobacco by cells and arabidopsis protoplasts . dual localization of methoxyfenozide inducible _METHOD_ in stably transformed arabidopsis . arabidopsis seedlings stably _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were imaged _PROTEIN_ after induction with methoxyfenozide .

the merged image in and co localization of _METHOD_ and mitotracker is observed based on the yellow color in the merged image in . boxes correspond to the regions of the cell shown at higher magnification in panels solid arrowheads indicate obvious examples of co localizations whereas open arrowheads indicate obvious examples of non co localization . the corresponding differential interference contrast image . scale bar . dual targeting of proteins to mitochondria and chloroplasts could be a consequence of alternative gene splicing transcription and/or translation initiation sites as well as perhaps an ambiguous targeting signal that is recognized by the import machinery at both organelles _PROTEIN_ . for example the import of thr trna synthetase into both mitochondria and chloroplast is considered to involve a shared targeting signal domain and specific organelle receptors whereas the carrier protein brittle requires distinct targeting information that is recognized by different organelle receptors . in the case of _PROTEIN_ the arabidopsis information resource depicts only one version of the gene and no potential splice variants . moreover cloning of or from total cdna resulted in only one clear sequence corresponding to _PROTEIN_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ in these three species are not alternatively spliced or transcribed despite the presence of a conserved second methionine amino acids downstream of the first n terminal methionine of and . with respect to an ambiguous dual targeting signal peptide while no consensus sequence has been identified to date n terminal sequences enriched in positively charged residues and deficient in glycine and negatively charged residues _PROTEIN_ or enriched in phenylalanine leucine and serine and deficient in glycine have been reported . however the n terminal sequences of _PROTEIN_ do not generally possess the same amino acid characteristics and therefore may possess some other yet to be identified dual targeting signals resulting in their localization to both _LOCATION_ and mitochondria . as depicted in the model in figure _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ as well as _LOCATION_ and mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ could serve physiological roles in both glyoxylate and _PROTEIN_ metabolism . for example abiotic stresses such as drought heat and salinity cause plant stomata to close leading to reduced intracellular _PROTEIN_ ratios and elevated rates of photorespiration which might result in the accumulation of glycolate and glyoxylate _PROTEIN_ . arabidopsis plants exposed to these stresses could have elevated glyr _PROTEIN_ as well as nad h/nad ratios suggesting that nadph dependent glyr activity would be stimulated _PROTEIN_ . in contrast _PROTEIN_ would be expected to _PROTEIN_ the absolute and relative rates of photorespiration _PROTEIN_ and deficiency stresses such as hypoxia and submergence would be expected to suppress the activity of glycolate oxidase so that glyoxylate would not be generated . however the levels of gaba and glyr _PROTEIN_ could increase together with the nad h/nad ratios resulting in the diversion of _PROTEIN_ from succinate production to hydroxybutyrate _PROTEIN_ . notably the submergence induced accumulation of ghb is _PROTEIN_ in both arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single knockout mutants _PROTEIN_ . gaba and hydroxybutyrate production has also been observed with many abiotic stresses . thus while the glyrs are biochemically interchangeable it can be hypothesized that they function in metabolically diverse cellular compartments .
