many fungal parasites enter plant cells by penetrating the host cell wall and thereafter differentiate specialized intracellular feeding structures called haustoria by invagination of the plant s _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . arabidopsis pen gene products are known to act at the cell periphery and function in the execution of apoplastic immune responses to limit fungal entry . this response underneath fungal contact sites is tightly linked with the deposition of plant cell wall polymers including _PROTEIN_ dependent callose in the paramural space thereby producing localized wall _PROTEIN_ called papillae . we show that powdery mildew fungi specifically induce the _LOCATION_ transport and entrapment of the fusion protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ syntaxin and its interacting partner monomeric yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ within the papillary _PROTEIN_ . remarkably _PROTEIN_ callose _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and the abc transporter _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ are selectively incorporated into _LOCATION_ encasements surrounding haustoria of the powdery mildew golovinomyces orontii suggesting that the same secretory defense responses become activated during the formation of papillae and haustorial encasements . this is consistent with a time course analysis of the encasement process indicating that these _LOCATION_ structures are generated through the extension of papillae . we show that _PROTEIN_ callose accumulation in papillae and haustorial encasements occurs independently of _PROTEIN_ syntaxin . we propose a model in which exosome biogenesis/release serves as a common transport mechanism by which the proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ otherwise resident in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ together with _LOCATION_ lipids become stably incorporated into both pathogen induced cell wall compartments .
the _PROTEIN_ syntaxin has been shown to accumulate at sites of attempted fungal entry in interactions between arabidopsis and the non _PROTEIN_ barley powdery mildew b. g. hordei as well as the _PROTEIN_ powdery mildew g. cichoracearum . to investigate whether this is a specific response to powdery mildews arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ a functional _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein were _PROTEIN_ with a range of different ascomycete pathogens that penetrate epidermal cells through the cuticle and cell wall . cells underlying fungal appressoria were analyzed by confocal microscopy at h post inoculation of seedling cotyledons . accumulation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was observed beneath the appressoria of two non _PROTEIN_ powdery mildews b. g. hordei and the pea powdery mildew e. pisi which typically fail to enter arabidopsis epidermal cells as indicated by the absence of haustoria . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ also accumulated beneath appressoria of the _PROTEIN_ powdery mildew g. orontii both at successful penetration sites as well as failed entry sites . quantitative analysis of interaction sites revealed that the _PROTEIN_ and non _PROTEIN_ powdery mildews induced accumulation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ beneath differentiated appressoria with comparable frequency . thus accumulation of _PROTEIN_ was not associated uniquely with failed mildew entry attempts and was triggered by both _PROTEIN_ and non _PROTEIN_ mildew species . appressoria of the non _PROTEIN_ rice blast fungus magnaporthe grisea were never observed to penetrate arabidopsis epidermal cells as shown by the absence of intracellular hyphae . callosic papillae were deposited by host cells beneath appressoria but accumulation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was never seen at these sites . similarly the non _PROTEIN_ medicago anthracnose fungus colletotrichum destructivum typically failed to enter arabidopsis epidermal cells although of sporelings entered epidermal cells as indicated by the formation of intracellular primary hyphae beneath appressoria . callosic papillae were present at both successful and unsuccessful entry sites of c. destructivum but the accumulation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was never observed at these sites . entry rates of the _PROTEIN_ crucifer anthracnose fungus colletotrichum higginsianum were higher than c. destructivum typically of appressoria formed primary hyphae . following penetration by both colletotrichum species the host _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ invaginated around the primary hyphae was labeled by _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ but the _METHOD_ intensity was similar to that of the normal _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . although the darkly melanized appressorial cell walls of m. grisea and colletotrichum species may attenuate the apparent _METHOD_ intensity of _METHOD_ beneath appressoria we obtained no evidence that any of these ascomycete fungi induce accumulation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ at attempted penetration sites even though they penetrate epidermal cells in a similar manner to powdery mildew fungi . furthermore _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ did not accumulate at successful entry sites of the _PROTEIN_ oomycete pathogen h. parasitica which enters arabidopsis epidermal cells from intercellular hyphae . taken together these results suggest that accumulation of _PROTEIN_ may be a unique response of plant cells to attempted entry by powdery mildews . in previous studies on the _PROTEIN_ powdery mildew g. cichoracearum optical sectioning by confocal microscopy detected the presence of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ within the interior of host papillae . however in the arabidopsis b. g. hordei interaction plasmolysis experiments indicated that focal accumulation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was associated with a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ microdomain rather than the papilla itself . to clarify the location of _PROTEIN_ accumulation at attempted entry sites we used both optical cross sectioning and plasmolysis experiments . in the arabidopsis b. g. hordei interaction optical sectioning at hpi demonstrated that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was uniformly distributed through the interior of papillae but was excluded from fungal penetration pegs encased within papillae . next we performed plasmolysis experiments on transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ either _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or monomeric yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins . cotyledons were plasmolyzed in m sorbitol and imaged by confocal microscopy . in plasmolyzed epidermal cells accumulation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ remained associated with papillae beneath appressoria . weaker _METHOD_ labeling by both fusion proteins was uniformly distributed along the protoplast _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ without visible enrichment into _LOCATION_ microdomains . no _METHOD_ signal was detected in papillae formed in non transgenic arabidopsis inoculated with b. g. hordei and the _METHOD_ emission spectrum associated with papillae formed in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants was characteristic of _METHOD_ . overall this extends previous observations that in addition to the syntaxin _PROTEIN_ resident in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ its _LOCATION_ associated interacting partner _PROTEIN_ also accumulates beneath powdery mildew appressoria . furthermore their concentration is _LOCATION_ resulting from incorporation into discrete cell wall _PROTEIN_ . remarkably _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ could still be detected in papillae at days post inoculation indicating that _METHOD_ remains stable outside the cell for extended periods of time .
