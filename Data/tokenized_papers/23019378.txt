posttranscriptional gene silencing _PROTEIN_ mediated by sirnas is an evolutionarily conserved antiviral defense mechanism in higher plants and invertebrates . in this mechanism viral derived sirnas are incorporated into the rna induced silencing complex to guide degradation of the corresponding viral rnas . in arabidopsis a key component of risc is _PROTEIN_ which not only binds to sirnas but also carries the rna slicer activity . at present little is known about posttranslational _METHOD_ regulating _PROTEIN_ turnover . here we report that the viral suppressor of rna silencing protein triggers _PROTEIN_ degradation by the autophagy pathway . using a inducible transgenic line we observed that _PROTEIN_ degradation is blocked by inhibition of autophagy . the engineering of a functional _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ reporter protein further indicated that _PROTEIN_ colocalizes with autophagy related _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ positive bodies when degradation is impaired . moreover this pathway also degrades _PROTEIN_ in a nonviral context especially when the production of mirnas is impaired . our results demonstrate that a selective process such as ubiquitylation can lead to the degradation of a key regulatory protein such as _PROTEIN_ by a degradation process generally believed to be unspecific . we anticipate that this mechanism will not only lead to degradation of _PROTEIN_ but also of its associated proteins and eventually small rnas .
to investigate the mechanism of mediated _PROTEIN_ degradation we used stably transformed arabidopsis xve transgenic lines in which _PROTEIN_ can be induced upon estradiol treatment . a kinetic analysis revealed a perfect correlation between appearance and _PROTEIN_ protein turnover . however we also noticed that the process of _PROTEIN_ degradation requires several hours and does not lead to a total disappearance of the protein . next we tested a panel of protease inhibitors . we found that the cysteine protease inhibitor known to inhibit the degradation of autophagic cargo inside autolysosomes led to _PROTEIN_ stabilization despite the presence of . overaccumulation of _PROTEIN_ protein in presence of results from both a higher _PROTEIN_ transcript level in induced plants and impaired protein turnover . the higher _PROTEIN_ transcript level is likely mediated by the regulatory loop consisting of _PROTEIN_ guided _PROTEIN_ catalyzed cleavage of _PROTEIN_ mrna but it is noteworthy that the drug had no significant effect on _PROTEIN_ accumulation . to further support the function of autophagy in the turnover of _PROTEIN_ we used methyladenine that blocks autophagosome formation via the inhibition of type iii phosphatidylinositol kinases _PROTEIN_ . similar to the effect of ma also led to a _METHOD_ accumulation of _PROTEIN_ protein despite the presence of . the possibility that autophagy mediates dependent _PROTEIN_ degradation is intriguing with respect to the proposed role of in mediating ubiquitylation . indeed previous work has shown that the viral f box protein interacts with the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ both in vitro and in yeast cells and that this interaction is required for the silencing suppressor activity of . to further investigate the function of ubiquitylation in this process we immunoprecipitated _PROTEIN_ from extracts of plants treated with in which _PROTEIN_ was induced or not . these assays revealed that _PROTEIN_ efficiently coprecipitates with as well as _PROTEIN_ suggesting that indeed is a component of an ligase targeting _PROTEIN_ in planta . it is noteworthy that in the absence of _PROTEIN_ also precipitates _PROTEIN_ although less efficiently suggesting that endogenous scf type ubiquitin ligases may also regulate _PROTEIN_ as recently proposed . furthermore we observed an enrichment of polyubiquitin conjugates in _PROTEIN_ immunoprecipitates in the presence of . specific ubiquitin antibodies revealed a significant enrichment in linked chains . whether _PROTEIN_ is directly ubiquitylated in a dependent manner or whether other proteins that coimmunoprecipitate together with _PROTEIN_ are modified by ubiquitin remains unknown . next we tested whether scf mediated ubiquitylation is required for dependant _PROTEIN_ protein turnover . we took advantage of mln a selective inhibitor of the neural precursor cell _PROTEIN_ developmentally down regulated _PROTEIN_ /ubiquitin related protein _PROTEIN_ conjugation pathway that controls the activity of cullin really interesting new gene _PROTEIN_ types of ubiquitin ligases in both mammals and plants . _PROTEIN_ was induced in the arabidopsis transgenic line in absence and in presence of mln . in these conditions the drug efficiently inhibited _PROTEIN_ neddylation and impaired _PROTEIN_ degradation . from these results we conclude that the process of _PROTEIN_ degradation requires ubiquitylation by an scf type ligase . the subcellular localization of the only human _PROTEIN_ protein that possesses endoribonuclease activity was found localized in the _LOCATION_ and enriched at discrete cytoplasmic foci corresponding to p bodies . at present very little is known about _PROTEIN_ subcellular localization in plants . to get insights on the _PROTEIN_ degradation process at the cellular level we engineered a construct in which the _METHOD_ is fused to the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the chimeric protein in an _PROTEIN_ defficient genomic context . this construct was used to transform heterozygous weak _PROTEIN_ and strong _PROTEIN_ mutant alleles respectively . full suppression of both mutant phenotypes indicated that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein is functional . in both mutant backgrounds the _METHOD_ signal was clearly visible in root tissues where the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein was detected in the _LOCATION_ but excluded from the _LOCATION_ . it is noteworthy that the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signal was enriched in proximity of the _LOCATION_ envelope and this was especially visible in the _PROTEIN_ complemented mutant line in which endogenous _PROTEIN_ is entirely replaced by the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein . it is interesting to note that the subcellular localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ resembles hasty the arabidopsis homolog of the mammalian transport receptors exportin suspected to be located at sites of nucleocytoplasmic mrna export . we subsequently introduced the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct in the lexa _LOCATION_ line . similarly to endogenous _PROTEIN_ the induction of by estradiol triggered the degradation of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein although estradiol alone had no effect on _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ subcellular localization and/or stability . note that the process of _PROTEIN_ degradation was not homogenous throughout the root but occurred stepwise in some cells or group of cells which most likely reflects a spatiotemporal variation in induction by estradiol . nevertheless after long periods of induction we noticed that most _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein disappeared from the root . induction in the presence of resulted in a _METHOD_ appearance of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ speckles in the _LOCATION_ . confocal _METHOD_ studies showed that a number of these _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ bodies colocalized with lysotracker red a red _METHOD_ dye that stains acidic compartments in live cells including lysosomes autolysosomes and _LOCATION_ . in agreement with ma acting upstream of autophagic vesicle formation we observed that this drug suppressed the formation of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ bodies in the presence of both and . to further investigate the nature of these structures where _PROTEIN_ concentrate consecutively to induction we analyzed the xve _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ reporter line treated with estradiol and using transmission electron microscopy and immunogold labeling . this revealed that triggered the accumulation of electron dense _LOCATION_ containing material inside _LOCATION_ . moreover _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized in this dense material often in close association with _LOCATION_ . these observations support the function of autophagy in mediated _PROTEIN_ degradation as proteins following this pathway terminate in the _LOCATION_ where they are degraded . in arabidopsis it was recently shown that _PROTEIN_ is a peripheral _LOCATION_ protein and that isoprenoid biosynthesis important for _LOCATION_ protein localization and trafficking is required for mirna function . although it is still unknown to which _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ associates in plant cells we noticed its enrichment at proximity of the _LOCATION_ apparatus . this is reminiscent of the situation in animal cells where both _PROTEIN_ and dicer like localize and fractionate with _LOCATION_ of the _LOCATION_ apparatus . it is important to note that in none of our em images did we observe a localization of _PROTEIN_ to multivesicular bodies arguing against their involvement in routing _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ . this situation is different from receptor proteins of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ such as arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which upon flagellin perception becomes ubiquitylated and translocated into intracellular vesicles including mvbs to be eventually degraded in the _LOCATION_ . autophagic vesicles can be visualized in plant cells using _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is covalently attached to the lipid phosphatidylethanolamine to produce _PROTEIN_ pe that is bound to autophagic _LOCATION_ via its lipid moiety . to further address the identity of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ bodies we coexpressed _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins in nicotania benthamiana cells . under these conditions _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signal was observed in the _LOCATION_ of transformed cells and only a few small structures of less than in which both _METHOD_ proteins colocalized could be detected in transformed cells . however induced the emergence of larger bodies containing both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ proteins . therefore even in the absence of inhibition of the autophagy pathway leads to _PROTEIN_ accumulation in autophagic vesicles . these structures were also observed consistently when was induced in these assays . in line with these results we found that _PROTEIN_ coimmunoprecipitates with _PROTEIN_ in treated arabidopsis plants whether was induced or not . _METHOD_ an arabidopsis deubiquitinating enzyme processing both polyubiquitin and linked chains was recently shown to be essential for _LOCATION_ biogenesis and its mutation leads to the accumulation of autophagosomes . _PROTEIN_ protein amount was at least fourfold enriched in this mutant suggesting that its degradation in a nonviral context depends on _METHOD_ function . when the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct was _PROTEIN_ in homozygous _METHOD_ mutant we consistently observed a strong accumulation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the root . moreover although _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was difficult to detect in the upper parts of wild type arabidopsis seedlings including cotyledon and primary leaves the protein was stabilized in the cotyledons of the homozygous _METHOD_ mutant . a closer inspection of these cells revealed that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ accumulated in vesicles that colocalized with the lipophilic dye which were previously shown to accumulate in the _METHOD_ mutant . next we investigated whether dependent degradation of _PROTEIN_ was compromised in this mutant . therefore the xve myc construct was introduced in the _METHOD_ mutant . hence accumulation led only to a weak reduction in _PROTEIN_ protein amount even after d of induction . in environmental favorable conditions the target of rapamycin _PROTEIN_ pathway promotes plant growth and restrains catabolic processes such as mrna degradation and autophagy in all eukaryotes . thus we introduced xve myc construct in a _PROTEIN_ overexpressing mutant line showing reduced autophagy activity . although induction was slightly delayed in the line its _PROTEIN_ was unable to promote _PROTEIN_ degradation . overall our data support a role of autophagy in mediated degradation of _PROTEIN_ . next we asked whether _PROTEIN_ degradation by the autophagy pathway is restricted to function or whether this pathway in a nonviral context may also degrade endogenous _PROTEIN_ as suggested by a higher accumulation of the protein in the _METHOD_ mutant and its colocalization with _PROTEIN_ in induced vesicles in the absence of . in line with this assumption we noticed a higher accumulation of _PROTEIN_ protein level in wild type seedlings when autophagy was chemically inhibited . because was proposed to promote _PROTEIN_ degradation more efficiently before it is incorporated in the risc complex we speculated that disturbing normal risc assembly might lead to _PROTEIN_ degradation . efficient risc assembly requires the incorporation of small rnas in both animal and plant cells . thus we selected mutations that are known to affect mirna biogenesis and accumulation including mutations in the double stranded rna binding protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and dicer homolog _PROTEIN_ mediating processing of most mirna precursors the rna methyltransferase _PROTEIN_ critical for mirna stability and hasty _PROTEIN_ the arabidopsis ortholog of _PROTEIN_ required for the _LOCATION_ export and/or stability of mirnas . rna and protein samples were extracted from wild type and the respective mutant lines and subjected to mrna and protein analyses . it is striking to note that _PROTEIN_ protein abundance was strongly reduced in all mutants that affect mirna biogenesis and accumulation . this reduction of _PROTEIN_ protein accumulation was not the consequence of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transcript levels as the _PROTEIN_ mrna level was similar to wild type in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and was even significantly increased in _PROTEIN_ and hst . to determine whether the _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ protein accumulation was the result of its active turnover by the autophagy pathway we treated _PROTEIN_ seedlings with . indeed blocking autophagy by this drug at least partially reestablished _PROTEIN_ protein accumulation in this mutant background . from these results we conclude that _PROTEIN_ is also degraded by the autophagy pathway in a nonviral context at least when mirna production or stability is compromised . altogether our results support a model in which a viral _METHOD_ ligase promotes the degradation by autophagy of a specific protein such as _PROTEIN_ . we also provide evidence that in the absence of endogenous scf trigger _PROTEIN_ degradation by the same pathway particularly under conditions in which risc assembly is compromised . further experiments will reveal whether _PROTEIN_ and eventually other argonaute proteins are also targeted to the same pathway during cellular stress a situation where mirna/sirna populations quickly change and risc reprogramming is expected .
