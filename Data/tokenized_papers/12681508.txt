the f o portion of the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ synthase contains a range of different subunits in bacteria yeast and mammals . a search of the arabidopsis genome identified sequence orthologs for only some of these subunits . blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis separation of arabidopsis mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes revealed intact f f o and separated f and f o components . the subunits of each complex were analysed by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and matched to arabidopsis genes . in the f f o complex a series of nine known subunits were identified along with two additional proteins matching the predicted products of the mitochondrial encoded _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes . the f complex contained the five well characterised f subunits while four subunits in the f o complex were identified subunit d subunit and the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ products . previously _PROTEIN_ has been suggested as the plant equivalent of subunit based on structural and sequence similarity . we propose that _PROTEIN_ is the plant b subunit based on structural similarity and its presence in the f o complex . chimerics of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ subunit and subunit have been associated with cytoplasmic male sterility in a variety of plant species our additional findings now place all these proteins in the same protein complex .
mitochondria can be isolated at a high level of purity from arabidopsis cell cultures and their protein components analysed . in our separation of arabidopsis _LOCATION_ proteins using bn _PROTEIN_ three complexes are highlighted that contain subunits of the arabidopsis f f o _PROTEIN_ synthase . previous analyses of this sort in plant mitochondria have typically identified an intact f f o complex and a dissociated f complex . the apparent mobility and general polypeptide composition of the intact f f o and f complexes in are similar to those previously observed in potato suggesting _METHOD_ of kda for f f o and for f . in addition we observe another complex with an apparent _METHOD_ of kda that contains three protein bands of _METHOD_ similar to components found in f f o but absent from f . this complex is thus likely to represent f o . we then attempted to identify each of the subunits of the intact complex and the two subcomplexes and thus to potentially identify unknown _PROTEIN_ synthase subunits physically associated with known components in native complexes . protein bands comprising f f o subunits and similar components from the putative f and f o subcomplexes were excised in gel digested with trypsin and the resultant peptides extracted . samples were analysed by _METHOD_ and spectral data matched to theoretical digests of the arabidopsis predicted proteome using mascot . this analysis revealed that four of the f f o protein bands and all the f protein bands contained peptides derived from the arabidopsis orthologs of the and f components from yeast and mammals _PROTEIN_ . in addition the f f o complex contained a kda protein matching the f a d subunit gene and a kda protein matching the gene encoding oscp . neither of these proteins were identified in the putative f or f o subcomplexes suggesting disassociation during the separation of f and f o . the f f o complex also contained three protein bands with apparent molecular _METHOD_ of and kda that were also found in the putative f o complex . peptides derived from the _LOCATION_ encoded d subunit and mitochondrial encoded _PROTEIN_ were found in the kda bands of spots and . the kda bands contained peptides derived from the mitochondrial encoded _PROTEIN_ . the kda bands stained weakly with _METHOD_ and were identified as the lipid binding protein subunit . subunit is known to bind _METHOD_ weakly and contains very few predicted peptides after trypsin digestion that are amenable to _METHOD_ detection . in recent mammalian research using _METHOD_ based detection of _PROTEIN_ synthase components this subunit was only identified by size on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we have identified two very abundant singly charged peptides from subunit samples with apparent molecular _METHOD_ of and which match by _METHOD_ analysis to peptides npslak and mlegak respectively in the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ sequence . the second peptide is not a predicted trypsin product but starts amino acids from the currently annotated n terminus of the protein . however the presence of this second peptide strongly suggests the first methionine of this peptide represents the true n terminus of the arabidopsis subunit and that in silico predictions are incorrect . the potato subunit n terminal sequence determined by et al . also commences mlegak confirming that this start site is probably common in plants . several protein spots were present in the gel shown and in some other replicate gel separations from which no _METHOD_ spectra could be obtained due to absence of peptides following gel elution . thus we have been unable to determine whether these represent true additional components or low level breakdown products of proteins in _PROTEIN_ . the large protein spot present above but not in line with components of f o is glutamate dehydrogenase and the streaks of protein material are both vdac based on _METHOD_ analysis . neither are components of the f f o _PROTEIN_ synthase and their presence near these subunits is probably coincidence . we have been unable to identify the product of the mitochondrial encoded _PROTEIN_ gene in either intact f f o or the f o subcomplex . this absence is likely due to the extreme hydrophobicity of this protein and its resultant peptides that in all probability preclude its identification by _METHOD_ extensive attempts to identify _PROTEIN_ peptides in the kda range in both the f f o and f o complexes despite the very low _METHOD_ staining of this area has failed to identify any such products .
