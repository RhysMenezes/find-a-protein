boron is essential for plants but toxic in excess . the borate efflux transporter _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in various root cells and localized to the inner/stele side domain of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ under low b conditions . _PROTEIN_ is rapidly degraded through endocytosis upon sufficient b supply . the _PROTEIN_ localization and degradation of _PROTEIN_ are considered important for efficient b translocation and avoidance of b toxicity respectively . in this study we first analyzed the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ in roots cotyledons and hypocotyls and revealed a _PROTEIN_ localization in various cell types . we also found that the inner _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is established after completion of cytokinesis in the root meristem . moreover variable angle _METHOD_ microscopy visualized _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ as particles in the pm with significant _PROTEIN_ movements but in restricted areas . importantly a portion of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ particles co localized with dynamin related protein _PROTEIN_ which is involved in scission of the clathrin coated vesicles and they disappeared together from the pm . to examine the contribution of _PROTEIN_ mediated endocytosis to _PROTEIN_ localization and degradation we developed an inducible _PROTEIN_ system of the _PROTEIN_ variant . the _PROTEIN_ variant prolonged the residence time of clathrin on the pm and inhibited endocytosis of _LOCATION_ lipids . the dominant negative _PROTEIN_ blocked endocytosis of _PROTEIN_ and disturbed its _PROTEIN_ localization and b induced degradation . our results provided insight into the endocytic _METHOD_ that modulate the subcellular localization and abundance of a mineral transporter for nutrient homeostasis in plant cells .
_PROTEIN_ plays important roles in b translocation from root to shoot and is localized to the inner/stele side pm domain in various root cell types . to gain further insights into the _PROTEIN_ and subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ we analyzed transgenic arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter . we first observed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in whole seedlings grown for d . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signals were observed in the primary root tip and mature portion of the root as reported previously . here we identified additional _PROTEIN_ in the basal region of the hypocotyl and tip of the cotyledon . in the cotyledon confocal microscopy of a cross section revealed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is _PROTEIN_ predominantly in epidermal cells on the top side . in these cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized to the pm . strikingly both an xy section of a physical cross section and a xz section reconstructed from z stack images of intact cotyledons revealed _PROTEIN_ localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ toward the inner side of the cotyledon . these results imply physiological roles for _PROTEIN_ in b uptake from the leaf surface and/or b redistribution from the cotyledon . in the basal region of hypocotyls _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ and localized with inner/stele side _PROTEIN_ in the endodermal cells . in the transition and differentiation zones of roots _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was highly _PROTEIN_ and localized with stele side _PROTEIN_ in the epidermal and endodermal cells . the _PROTEIN_ localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ can be judged in comparison with the pm by staining with a lipophilic dye . in the root meristem zone _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ in various cell types epidermal endodermal columella parts of the _PROTEIN_ cap quiescent center _PROTEIN_ vascular initial and protovascular cells . interestingly in the _PROTEIN_ vascular initial and protovascular cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed apical _PROTEIN_ localization . to corroborate the localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in these cells that are located deep in the roots we performed multiphoton microscopy . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed apical _PROTEIN_ localization within approximately eight protovascular cells from the _PROTEIN_ whereas the _PROTEIN_ in the upper cells was not determined because of weak signals . our observations of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ indicate that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in various tissues including the cotyledon and hypocotyl and generally shows _PROTEIN_ localization toward the center of the tissues . we showed that _PROTEIN_ is localized to the pm with _PROTEIN_ in various cell types . however we noticed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is localized in a non _PROTEIN_ manner in the cell plate in dividing cells . to characterize the process of _PROTEIN_ acquisition of _PROTEIN_ we performed time lapse imaging of dividing cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ initially localized to the cell plate without _PROTEIN_ and then gradually obtained stele side _PROTEIN_ after completion of cell division . to assess the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ intensities of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the pm were plotted . compared with the _PROTEIN_ localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the apical and basal pm the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ distribution was not significantly _PROTEIN_ in the newly generated pm . however at min after the completion of cell division _PROTEIN_ localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was clearly established and was indistinguishable from those of the apical and basal pm . we also calculated the _PROTEIN_ index of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal in comparison with staining in the newly formed pm after the completion of cell division . the _PROTEIN_ index of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was approximately for the first min and then increased to about by min after cell division . these results imply that endocytic removal from the newly generated pm is involved in the _PROTEIN_ acquisition of _PROTEIN_ . to address the role of endocytosis in the _PROTEIN_ localization of _PROTEIN_ we focused on the localization and function of _PROTEIN_ a major isoform of the family _PROTEIN_ in seedlings . to investigate the association of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in vivo we performed confocal microscopy of transgenic arabidopsis seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter and those _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed accumulation in the outer/soil side pm domain in epidermal cells of the root transition zone and in the cell plates in mitotic cells of the meristematic zone as described previously . importantly the localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overlapped at the pm and cell plate . to verify the association of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we performed vaem analysis at the soil side pm domain of the epidermal cells in elongation and differentiation zones . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was observed as particles that exhibited considerable movement in restricted regions in the pm . in contrast _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was observed as relatively immobile transient puncta as described previously . most _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ particles were independent of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . only of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ particles were co localized with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and approximately of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ puncta were co localized with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the rate of co localization was similar to that by random co localization . nevertheless time lapse vaem analysis identified cases in which _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ appeared and co localized with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ particles for about s and then disappeared . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ particle disappeared about s after the dissociation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . these observations suggest the following processes of endocytosis _PROTEIN_ is packed into the endocytic pit associates with the endocytic pit cuts off the vesicle and dissociates from the vesicle and the _PROTEIN_ containing vesicles remain near the cell surface for about s and then move away . in mammalian cells dominant negative inhibition of dynamin is established as an effective method of inhibiting cme . dynamin mutants carrying or are unable to bind to _PROTEIN_ and cut off ccv from the pm . the _PROTEIN_ of dynamin mutants inhibits cme in _METHOD_ of the internalization of transferrin and epidermal growth _PROTEIN_ receptor in a dominant negative manner . the human dynamin and plant share similar _PROTEIN_ domains at the n terminal regions and of human dynamin corresponds to of . based on this information we established an estradiol inducible _PROTEIN_ system of the wild type and the mutant _PROTEIN_ fused c terminally to _METHOD_ . immunoblot analysis using an antibody against _PROTEIN_ showed that the _PROTEIN_ levels of the wild type and the mutant _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were and fold respectively compared with those of endogenous _PROTEIN_ in the transgenic plants treated for d with estradiol . in this condition the wild type and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were detected with variable intensities in epidermal cells in the root tips . a patchy pattern of estradiol inducible _PROTEIN_ in the root epidermis was observed as reported previously . in cells strongly accumulating _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ internalization of an endocytic tracer was clearly inhibited . it should be noted that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ frequently labeled aggregates with variable sizes in the cytoplasm . the aggregates containing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were not labeled with clathrin light chain _METHOD_ a tgn marker in the cytoplasm suggesting that the aggregates are not derived from the tgn/ee . as determined by confocal microscopy the morphology of tgn/ee labeled with clc _METHOD_ was unaffected irrespective of the level of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . to characterize the behavior of the dominant negative _PROTEIN_ variant at the pm we performed time lapse vaem analyses . at the cell surface _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ exhibited a longer residential time than wild type _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ inhibits cme we then analyzed the behavior of ccps labeled by clc _METHOD_ at the cell surface . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ frequently co localized with clc _METHOD_ and clc _METHOD_ showed significantly longer residential time when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was highly _PROTEIN_ . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ associates with the ccps and inhibits vesicular scission . to assess the physiological effect of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ we investigated the growth and cellular morphology of seedlings under estradiol induced and control conditions . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants as well as _PROTEIN_ mutant plants had short hypocotyls under dark conditions and reduced root and shoot growth under light conditions . furthermore we found that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ disturbed cell elongation and proper cell division in the primary root and affected the morphology of cotyledon epidermal cells as in the case of _PROTEIN_ mutant cells . importantly several _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants grew more poorly than _PROTEIN_ . this result implies that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ inhibits the function not only of _PROTEIN_ but also of other members . combined these findings suggested that the inducible _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is useful for the functional inhibition of dependent cme . to address the contribution of to the constitutive endocytosis of _PROTEIN_ we analyzed the internalization level of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under bfa treatment . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulated in the bfa compartments in cells _PROTEIN_ wild type _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ however _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was not or was less accumulated in the bfa compartments in cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the internalization level of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was negatively correlated with the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ but it was not correlated with that of wild type _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . these results suggest that mediated vesicular scission is required for the constitutive endocytosis of _PROTEIN_ . to test the hypothesis that mediates the relocation of _PROTEIN_ from the soil side pm domains we investigated the _PROTEIN_ localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in various cell types _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at high levels bor _METHOD_ showed weak _PROTEIN_ in epidermal cells of the elongation and meristem zones and root cap cells . furthermore several cells showed ectopic localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ as puncta at the soil side pm domain . in plants treated with dimethylsulfoxide _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ wild type _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ induced by estradiol _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ remained _PROTEIN_ in the epidermal cells . we also analyzed the effect of single loss of function of _PROTEIN_ using the _PROTEIN_ mutant . in the epidermal cells of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was significantly disturbed although _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was not localized to the puncta . unlike the consequence of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization remained _PROTEIN_ in the columella in _PROTEIN_ . this suggests that other members such as _PROTEIN_ which is highly _PROTEIN_ in columella are redundantly involved in the endocytosis of _PROTEIN_ in those cells . the _PROTEIN_ indexes of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in epidermal cells of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants treated with _METHOD_ and estradiol were and respectively . similarly those in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants were and respectively . in addition to the root tip _PROTEIN_ localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was disturbed in the cotyledon epidermis of _PROTEIN_ plants . these results indicate that dependent endocytosis is required for the inner/stele side _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in various cell types . we then analyzed the contribution of mediated endocytosis to the b induced degradation of _PROTEIN_ . we reported previously that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was transported to endosomes which appeared as punctate structures in the cell after approximately min of high b supply . the _METHOD_ core derived from _METHOD_ fused _LOCATION_ protein is relatively stable in the _LOCATION_ under dark conditions . in the case of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the _METHOD_ signal was observable in the _LOCATION_ upon high b supply for several hours under dark conditions indicating that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was transported to and degraded in the _LOCATION_ . after induction of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with estradiol for d the transgenic plants were transferred from a medium with to one with or b and incubated for min . strikingly the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ derived signal was preferentially localized to the pm in cells with a strong _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ whereas it appeared in punctate endosomes and _LOCATION_ in cells with a weak _PROTEIN_ . we also analyzed b induced endocytosis of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ after min of low or high b supply . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ derived signal was _PROTEIN_ detected in endosomes while little was detected in the pm in wild type plants upon high b supply . however in the _PROTEIN_ mutant the signal was detected _PROTEIN_ in the pm and little was detected in the endosomes . these results suggest that b induced endocytosis of _PROTEIN_ was almost completely inhibited in the cells with strong _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and partially inhibited by single loss of function of _PROTEIN_ . it is possible that other members are redundantly involved in the b induced endocytosis of _PROTEIN_ . taken together our findings indicate that mediated endocytosis is required not only for constitutive endocytosis under low b conditions but also for b induced degradation of _PROTEIN_ .
