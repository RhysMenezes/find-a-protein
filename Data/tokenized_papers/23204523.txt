calcium is a key second messenger in eukaryotes and regulates diverse cellular processes most notably via calmodulin . in arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ is the founding member of the iqd family of putative cam targets . the predicted iqd proteins share a conserved domain of amino acids that is characterized by a unique arrangement of multiple cam recruitment motifs including so called iq motifs . whereas _PROTEIN_ has been implicated in the regulation of defense metabolism the biochemical functions of iqd proteins remain to be elucidated . in this study we show that _PROTEIN_ binds to multiple arabidopsis cam and cam like proteins in vitro and in yeast two hybrid interaction assays . cam overlay assays revealed moderate affinity of _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ . deletion mapping of _PROTEIN_ demonstrated the importance of the domain for _PROTEIN_ binding in vitro which is corroborated by interaction of the shortest iqd member _PROTEIN_ with arabidopsis cam/cmls in yeast . a genetic screen of a cdna library identified arabidopsis kinesin light chain related protein _PROTEIN_ as an _PROTEIN_ interactor . the subcellular localization of _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ proteins to microtubules and the cell _LOCATION_ in transiently and stably transformed plant tissues suggests direct interaction of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in planta that is supported by _METHOD_ dependent recruitment of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ to microtubules . collectively the prospect arises that _PROTEIN_ and related proteins provide /cam regulated scaffolds for facilitating cellular transport of specific cargo along microtubular tracks via kinesin motor proteins .
we previously demonstrated dependent interaction of epitope tagged arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ with bovine cam . here we extended these studies to include several arabidopsis _METHOD_ and cml proteins . in arabidopsis and genes code for canonical _METHOD_ and cml proteins respectively . the distinct cam loci encode cam _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which differ by residues and share at least identity to conserved vertebrate _METHOD_ . we performed in vitro pulldown assays with _PROTEIN_ and two arabidopsis cam _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as well as with two cml proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . we included _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ because both proteins differ considerably from conventional _METHOD_ . the strep tagged _METHOD_ and cmls were _PROTEIN_ in e. coli and purified by affinity chromatography on strep tactin sepharose beads . after co incubation of strep tagged _METHOD_ or cmls and epitope tagged _PROTEIN_ in the presence of mm or mm egta the strep tactin sepharose beads were repeatedly washed . bound proteins were eluted by boiling in _PROTEIN_ sample loading buffer . proteins of all fractions were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transferred to a _LOCATION_ and probed with tag monoclonal antibody to detect _PROTEIN_ fusion protein . as shown in fig . full length _PROTEIN_ co sedimented with all tested _METHOD_ and cmls only in the presence of and binding was abolished when egta was added to the buffer . in summary the data confirm our previous results with bovine cam and demonstrate the capacity of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ to interact in a dependent manner with various arabidopsis _METHOD_ and cmls in vitro . in a first approach to experimentally delineate the cam binding region of iqd proteins we took advantage of the structural diversity of the iqd family in arabidopsis . whereas _PROTEIN_ the smallest iqd member comprises the domain at its c terminus and a short n terminal extension of amino acid residues the _PROTEIN_ protein misses residues of its centrally positioned motif which was likely caused by exon loss . we employed cam overlay assays to compare the ability of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to interact with _PROTEIN_ in a dependent manner . the tagged iqd proteins were _PROTEIN_ in bacteria and total protein extracts were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transferred to nitrocellulose _LOCATION_ renatured and probed with radiolabeled _PROTEIN_ which was prepared by in vitro transcription/translation in the presence of met followed by affinity chromatography purification on ni _PROTEIN_ and proteolytic removal of the epitope tag . as a positive control we used bacterial lysates _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ which did bind to met labeled _PROTEIN_ in the presence of calcium but not in its absence . we also observed an interaction of the _PROTEIN_ probe with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but not with _PROTEIN_ . in contrast to the pulldown assays cam binding was only detected in the absence of which is not an uncommon observation for iq motif containing proteins . in conclusion our data point to the importance of the domain for mediating cam/cml interaction . in a second approach to map the cam interaction domain of iqd proteins we generated a series of overlapping n and c terminal deletions of _PROTEIN_ each tagged with and epitopes _PROTEIN_ that we tested for cam binding in overlay assays . full length _PROTEIN_ and truncated _PROTEIN_ polypeptides were affinity purified by ni _PROTEIN_ chromatography separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transferred to nitrocellulose _LOCATION_ renatured and probed with met labeled _PROTEIN_ as above . protein loading was assessed by epitope detection . as expected _PROTEIN_ binding was only observed for _PROTEIN_ polypeptides comprising the domain which further supports a role of this domain for recruiting cam . using full length _PROTEIN_ protein we determined by cam overlay assays and scatchard plot analysis the apparent dissociation constant of the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the calculated value indicates a relatively low affinity of _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ under the in vitro assay conditions used . we previously showed dependent interaction of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with bovine cam . to validate in vivo the observed in vitro interactions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with cam we performed yeast two hybrid interaction assays . both iqd proteins were fused to the dna binding domain or activation domain . we selected cam/cml proteins representing the nine groups of the arabidopsis cam/cml family for construction of cam/cml prey vectors . a _PROTEIN_ bait vector _PROTEIN_ was used as a positive control for cam interaction in yeast . the respective bait and prey vectors were co transformed into the yeast reporter strain harboring two reporter genes integrated into the chromosome and lacz . the reporter activity was assayed by testing the growth of transformants on sd medium lacking his . lacz reporter gene _PROTEIN_ was monitored by a quantitative enzyme assay of galactosidase activity . as shown in fig . none of the negative controls was able to grow on restrictive sd medium _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ whereas the positive control _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ revealed robust growth and _PROTEIN_ of galactosidase activity which was similar to published results . furthermore there was no evidence for homotypic interaction of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . when compared with the positive control yeast cells transformed with plasmids encoding bd _PROTEIN_ and ad _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed only weak growth on sd medium lacking his and low _PROTEIN_ of galactosidase activity . however co transformation with bd _PROTEIN_ and each of the different ad cml constructs did not support yeast growth on his deficient sc medium and only background galactosidase activity was _PROTEIN_ . on the other hand co transformation of yeast with bd _PROTEIN_ and ad cam/cmls revealed preferential yet relatively robust interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ and whereas no interaction was observed for bd _PROTEIN_ and the other ad cam/cml fusion proteins . in summary although yeast two hybrid assays may not be the ideal system to study or to identify cam target proteins our results indicate weak but differential interaction of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with cam/cmls in vivo and thus support our in vitro interaction studies . because _PROTEIN_ is highly _PROTEIN_ in flowers and developing siliques of a. thaliana we screened a flower cdna library for _PROTEIN_ interacting proteins . the cdna library was constructed by recombination with rec vector in yeast strain resulting in a fusion of each cdna with the . full length cdna of _PROTEIN_ was cloned in frame with the _PROTEIN_ bait vector and introduced into yeast strain . two hybrid screens were carried out by mating _PROTEIN_ with the cdna library . the resulting diploid cells were plated on growth restrictive sd medium . a total of colonies were selected and tested for lacz _PROTEIN_ by measurement of galactosidase activity in liquid assays . only of the yeast strains _PROTEIN_ robust galactosidase activity which were used for plasmid recovery and sequencing of the prey cdna insert . three strains harbored cdnas predicted to encode a tetratricopeptide repeat domain _PROTEIN_ containing protein and the fourth library clone encoded a glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ belonging to the tau class of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . using the predicted _GENE_ protein as a query we identified two closely related tpr proteins in arabidopsis with similarity to mammalian kinesin light chain subunits of kinesin motor proteins . the three putative arabidopsis klcs encoded by _GENE_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ are hereafter referred to as klcr proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . superimposition of the modeled _PROTEIN_ protein and of the experimentally solved tpr or tpr domains confirm presence of a structurally similar _PROTEIN_ type domain in _PROTEIN_ which suggests functional conservation of human klc and arabidopsis klcr proteins . the original diploids _PROTEIN_ bd _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and bd _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ produced and miller units of galactosidase activity respectively which is indicative of a relatively robust protein protein interaction . we confirmed these interactions by independent plasmid co transformation of yeast with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ vectors of either configuration as well as with control plasmids _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . after mating the resulting diploid yeast cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ showed vigorous growth and lacz _PROTEIN_ on restrictive sd medium which was independent of the bait or prey configuration . taken together our results demonstrate strong and reproducible interactions between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as well as between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which are comparable with the interaction of the control proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . kinesins are a family of cellular motor proteins that move along _PROTEIN_ microtubule tracks to transport various cargos which are either directly attached to the khc or to its associated klc via the _PROTEIN_ domain . the putative role of klcr proteins in microtubular transport and the verified interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ in yeast prompted us to reinvestigate the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ . we previously reported targeting of an _METHOD_ fusion protein to the cell _LOCATION_ when _PROTEIN_ under the control of the constitutive camv promoter in roots of transgenic arabidopsis plants . here we transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ constructs in tobacco leaves and monitored _METHOD_ _METHOD_ by confocal laser scanning microscopy at high resolution . as expected for control transformations the _METHOD_ protein localized to the _LOCATION_ and cell _LOCATION_ . for transient _PROTEIN_ of c terminal _METHOD_ or n terminal _METHOD_ fusion proteins we confirmed _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ but observed additional _METHOD_ _METHOD_ associated with cytoskeletal structures . because _PROTEIN_ likely interacts with kinesin motor proteins that transport cargo along microtubule tracks we examined the effect of oryzalin an herbicide promoting microtubule depolymerization . as shown in fig . oryzalin treatment caused collapse of cytoskeletal associated _METHOD_ _METHOD_ indicating association of _PROTEIN_ with the microtubular network . in addition we studied oryzalin dependent _METHOD_ localization in hypocotyl tissues of transgenic arabidopsis seedlings . the results in a stable homologous plant transformation system are consistent with the observation in transiently transformed tobacco leaves . we independently analyzed the subcellular localization of _METHOD_ in transgenic plants by co immunolabeling of microtubules and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ which demonstrated co localization of both proteins to microtubules . because _PROTEIN_ is predicted to assist kinesins in cargo transport along microtubules we first compared the subcellular localization of _METHOD_ with _METHOD_ in tobacco leaves that were transiently transfected with _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ plasmids . although _METHOD_ localized to microtubules _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ displayed diffuse cellular _METHOD_ indicative of _LOCATION_ localization . interestingly when both dna constructs were co transfected _METHOD_ co localized with the microtubular pattern of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ indicating recruitment of _METHOD_ to the microtubular network by _METHOD_ most likely via direct interaction in planta . similarly transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ alone revealed red _METHOD_ consistent with _LOCATION_ localization of tagged _PROTEIN_ . again co _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ caused microtubular co localization of both fusion proteins suggesting _PROTEIN_ dependent recruitment of _PROTEIN_ to the microtubules . additional co transfection experiments support a role of _PROTEIN_ for recruiting _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to the microtubular skeleton . although co _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ did not alter the _LOCATION_ localization of either protein co _PROTEIN_ of both protein fusions together with untagged _PROTEIN_ resulted in a microtubular localization of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . these data also support the functionality of the _METHOD_ protein fusion . taken together our results demonstrate co localization of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to microtubules and further indicate _PROTEIN_ dependent recruitment of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to the microtubular network via direct interaction .
the bacterial vector for _PROTEIN_ of recombinant _PROTEIN_ fused to an n terminal epitope tag was previously described . similarly full length cdna fragments encoding the predicted arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins were generated by rt pcr using gene specific primers and mobilized into the vector which provides the n terminal tag . to allow for production of recombinant proteins with two epitope tags full length _PROTEIN_ and partial cdnas encoding truncated _PROTEIN_ polypeptides were generated by pcr and mobilized into the vector . production of recombinant arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fused to the c terminal strep tag ii was supported by pask bacterial vectors which were obtained from c. . the authenticity of all cloned cdna fragments was verified by dna sequencing . plasmids were transformed into escherichia coli cells for protein _PROTEIN_ and purification using standard protocols . _PROTEIN_ of recombinant proteins was induced by mm isopropyl d thiogalactopyranoside for at least h at . bacterial cells were lysed by sonication in buffer a for most experiments or in buffer b for _LOCATION_

proteins were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and transferred to nitrocellulose _LOCATION_ . the _LOCATION_ were blocked overnight with bsa in tbst buffer and subsequently overlaid with mm met labeled _PROTEIN_ in the same buffer containing mm or mm egta . the _LOCATION_ were washed times for min in the respective buffers without probe . bound _PROTEIN_ was detected by phosphorimaging analysis . for determining saturation curves of _PROTEIN_ binding full length _PROTEIN_ recombinant protein was purified by ni _PROTEIN_ chromatography under native conditions and spotted on nitrocellulose _LOCATION_ discs that were sequentially incubated in blocking solution for h at room temperature followed by incubation in blocking solution containing different concentrations of met labeled _PROTEIN_ in the presence of mm or mm egta . after washing in tbst buffer without radiolabeled _PROTEIN_ the amount of bound _PROTEIN_ was measured by liquid scintillation counting . not more than of added met labeled _PROTEIN_ remained at the _LOCATION_ at any condition . specific _PROTEIN_ binding was calculated as the difference between total binding and nonspecific binding _PROTEIN_ . the kd value was determined by scatchard plot analysis . for yeast two hybrid interaction assays the coding sequences of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were amplified by pcr and cloned into the bait vector to create plasmids encoding iqd protein fusions with the dna binding domain . plasmids encoding fusions of arabidopsis _METHOD_ and cmls with the activation domain were obtained either from c. _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or were constructed by pcr and insert mobilization into the prey vector for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and . plasmid templates for arabidopsis _METHOD_ and cmls cdnas were obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center . full length cdnas of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were also inserted into to test for in vivo homodimerization . all plasmid constructs were verified by dna sequencing . plasmid pgad _PROTEIN_ served as a positive control for cam interaction and was provided by c. . the bait and prey vectors to be tested for interaction of the fusion proteins were co transformed into yeast strain using the standard lithium acetate method . protein protein interactions were scored and quantified by the ability to activate two reporter genes under control of the promoter and lacz . the reporter activity was monitored by testing transformants on synthetic dropout medium lacking histidine . yeast colonies selected for the presence of the bait and prey plasmids were grown in liquid sd medium to an optical density of . serial fold dilutions were spotted on growth permissive and growth restrictive sd agar plates . lacz reporter gene

library was constructed using the bd matchmaker library construction and screening kit . poly rna prepared from flower tissues was used for cdna synthesis according to the manufacturer 's instruction . first strand cdna was amplified by long distance pcr using the bd advantage pcr kit . the purified cdna was then fused to the activation domain of the bait rec _PROTEIN_ vector by recombination in yeast strain which yielded more than four million original transformants . the yeast two hybrid cdna library screening was performed using the bd matchmaker two hybrid system . full length cdna of

his and adenine . positive colonies appearing within days of plating were subsequently streaked on restrictive sd medium and tested for lacz _PROTEIN_ by a liquid onpg galactosidase assay to estimate the strength of interactions . clones generating miller units > were _PROTEIN_ as candidates . after the confirmation of the growth phenotype and lacz _PROTEIN_ plasmid dna was isolated from yeast cells and transformed into e. coli strain by electroporation . because the isolated dna is a mixture of both plasmids the transformed e. coli were plated on lb medium containing ampicillin to select for the ad cdna library plasmid only . the cdna inserts were amplified using the bd matchmaker ad _PROTEIN_ insert screening amplimer set and the bd advantage pcr kit to analyze the number of ad
