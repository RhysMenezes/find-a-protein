_LOCATION_ in guard cells plays an important role in stomatal movement responses to environmental stimuli . these _LOCATION_ increases result from influx through permeable channels in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and release from intracellular organelles in guard cells . however the genes encoding defined _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ permeable channel activity remain unknown in guard cells and with some exceptions largely unknown in higher plant cells . here we report the identification of two arabidopsis cation channel genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ that are highly _PROTEIN_ in guard cells . _LOCATION_ application of cyclic gmp and _LOCATION_ applied _LOCATION_ permeable bromoguanosine cyclic monophosphate cgmp both activated hyperpolarization induced inward conducting currents in wild type guard cells using as the _PROTEIN_ charge carrier . the cgmp activated currents were strongly blocked by lanthanum and gadolinium and also conducted and na ions . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant guard cells exhibited dramatically impaired cgmp activated currents . in contrast mutations in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ did not disrupt these cgmp activated currents . the yellow _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ and yellow _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ proteins localize in the cell periphery . cyclic amp activated modest inward currents in both wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant guard cells . moreover _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant guard cells exhibited functional abscisic acid activated hyperpolarization dependent permeable cation channel currents intact aba induced stomatal closing responses and whole plant stomatal conductance responses to darkness and changes in _PROTEIN_ concentration . furthermore cgmp activated currents remained intact in the growth controlled by abscisic and abscisic acid mutants . this research demonstrates that the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes encode unique cgmp activated nonselective permeable cation channels in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of arabidopsis guard cells .
cyclic nucleotide activated ion channels function as a type of cyclic nucleotide gated permeable channel in mammalian cells and some arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ have been reported to encode functional cyclic nucleotide gated permeable channels . we performed experiments to test whether cyclic nucleotides could trigger currents in arabidopsis guard cells . we found that inward currents were activated in columbia wild type guard cells upon _LOCATION_ application of _LOCATION_ permeable bromoguanosine cyclic monophosphate cgmp . we used as the _PROTEIN_ divalent cation in the bath solution because it has been established that permeable channels in plants cells are often permeable to multiple divalent cations including and and would be unlikely to interfere with dependent responses . since and were the _PROTEIN_ ions in the bath and pipette solutions under the imposed conditions it was possible that the cgmp activated inward currents result from either the influx of ions or the efflux of across the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of arabidopsis guard cells . therefore we analyzed the reversal potential of the cgmp activated currents . due to the voltage dependence of the cgmp activated currents the reversal potential could be approximately extrapolated as the voltage where the average cgmp activated currents merged with the average control currents in wild type arabidopsis guard cells which was approximately mv after correction of the liquid junction potential of mv measured as described previously . under the imposed conditions equilibrium potentials of and were and mv after correction of ionic activities respectively . the reversal potential of the cgmp activated currents at mv was close to the equilibrium potential of but far from that of . these data show a permeability of the cgmp activated currents . we tested the effects of and two well known plant channel blockers on the cgmp activated inward currents in guard cells . we found that the cgmp activated inward currents were strongly inhibited by or . we further tested the selectivity of cgmp induced currents to cations by replacing with the large cation n methyl d _PROTEIN_ in the bath solution and found that the cgmp activated inward currents were abolished . in contrast similar current amplitudes were observed after was replaced by at the same concentration in the bath solution showing that the cgmp activated inward currents recorded in guard cells were carried _PROTEIN_ by these divalent cations . we also analyzed the cgmp activated currents using simple solutions as described previously and found the cgmp activated currents . the reversal potential of the recorded cgmp activated currents was mv close to the equilibrium potential of but distant from the equilibrium potential of . cgmp activated currents were also recorded using step wise voltage pulses indicating that the currents are hyperpolarization activated but the activation is not time dependent . the _PROTEIN_ nature of these cgmp activated currents is similar to permeable cation channel currents recorded previously in guard cells . these inward currents were observed after was replaced by in the bath solution with in the pipette solution and the reversal potential was mv far from the equilibrium potential of . the permeability ratio for relative to was as determined according to the goldman hodgkin katz equation . these results show that cgmp activates nonselective permeable cation currents . further experiments showed that the cgmp activated currents can also be carried by the monovalent cation na similar to aba activated permeable cation channels in guard cells . taken together these results showed that cgmp activates nonselective permeable cation channels in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of guard cells . therefore we named the cgmp activated nonselective permeable cation currents icat cgmp . genes encoding defined _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ permeable channels remain poorly understood in guard cells . to identify putative permeable channel genes underlying icat cgmp we analyzed guard cell specific microarray sets of arabidopsis and found that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes were highly _PROTEIN_ in guard cells . we obtained cngc transfer dna insertion mutant lines for these _PROTEIN_ genes . as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are among the two most closely related of the _PROTEIN_ genes we generated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants by crossing the single mutants for further experiments . reverse transcription pcr and quantitative real time pcr analyses showed that the mrna levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were greatly reduced or abolished in _PROTEIN_ . to pursue the identification of genes encoding ion channels that mediate icat cgmp in arabidopsis guard cells we performed patch clamp experiments on _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutant and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant guard cells as well as on _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants . patch clamp experiments showed that average current magnitudes of icat cgmp were only partially reduced in the two single mutants including an insignificant average reduction in the _PROTEIN_ single mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . note that all data were included in these analyses and the data from _PROTEIN_ guard cells included one guard cell with a large leak like current after cgmp addition thus adding to a larger degree of _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . we analyzed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant guard cells which showed strongly impaired cgmp activated currents compared with the columbia wild type . these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ contribute to the activity of the icat cgmp channel currents in arabidopsis guard cells . to further test the effects of mutations in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ on icat cgmp we generated a second double mutant allele _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the wassilewskija accession . _PROTEIN_ mrna levels in the _PROTEIN_ mutant were greatly reduced . the _PROTEIN_ transcript has two splice _METHOD_ in ws . we thus amplified several independent _PROTEIN_ transcripts in _PROTEIN_ . the untranslated region insertion in _PROTEIN_ showed either greatly reduced transcripts for two different primer pairs including primers that amplified transcript starting bp of the _PROTEIN_ start site or an increased transcript level with primers amplifying from the predicted start _PROTEIN_ site of the _PROTEIN_ transcript . these data indicate that the _PROTEIN_ gene was clearly reduced whereas the _PROTEIN_ gene was less clearly affected in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . we confirmed significant activation of icat cgmp by cgmp applied in the pipette solution in ws wild type guard cells . in contrast impaired activation was observed in _PROTEIN_ mutant guard cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ providing evidence for an important function of _PROTEIN_ in mediating the cgmp activated current in the ws accession . the effect of the t dna insertion in _PROTEIN_ and aberrant _PROTEIN_ transcripts amplified in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ can not at present unequivocally define or exclude a contribution of _PROTEIN_ to this phenotype in the ws accession . microarray data sets suggest that several other _PROTEIN_ genes are _PROTEIN_ in guard cells including _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and it has been reported that _PROTEIN_ functions as a camp activated permeable channel in arabidopsis guard cells . therefore we isolated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion mutants and generated a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant line in the ws ecotype background . the _PROTEIN_ insertion mutant line had a t dna insertion in the untranslated region of _PROTEIN_ and did not exhibit a reduction in _PROTEIN_ transcript level thus _PROTEIN_ could not be analyzed in this study . we performed further patch clamp experiments on _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant guard cells and found that there was no significant difference of icat cgmp in _PROTEIN_ mutant guard cells and its columbia wild type as well as between the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant and its ws wild type . these results indicate that cgmp _PROTEIN_ activated _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the wild type relative to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis guard cells under the imposed conditions . camp has been shown to activate permeable currents in arabidopsis guard cells using as the _PROTEIN_ divalent cation in both bath and pipette solutions . as reported above cgmp activated inward currents could be carried by . we analyzed camp activated inward currents using as the _PROTEIN_ charge carrier . the results showed that only modest camp activated inward currents were observed in both columbia wild type and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant guard cells with camp applied into the pipette solution . there was no significant difference between columbia wild type and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant guard cells . these data and the lack of impairment of cgmp activation in _PROTEIN_ guard cells compared with camp response impairment in _PROTEIN_ suggest that the cgmp activated currents in the solutions analyzed here differ from the camp activated currents . to gain insight into the cellular targeting of yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins we transiently _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fused to enhanced _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in n. benthamiana protoplasts and conducted _METHOD_ _METHOD_ imaging experiments using confocal microscopy . the results showed localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in microdomains in the periphery of n. benthamiana protoplasts . similar microdomain localizations of plant _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusions have been observed previously including for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ also localized to the periphery of n. benthamiana protoplasts . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ did not show a strong concentration in microdomains and overlapped partially with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ stain . in contrast control _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protoplasts showed more broadly distributed _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signals including in the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ . these results provide initial evidence that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are targeted to the periphery of plant cells at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ which correlates with the strong reductions in icat cgmp activity in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant guard cells and is consistent with recent _METHOD_ fusion localization analysis of _PROTEIN_ . we used _LOCATION_ permeable cgmp to activate large currents in guard cells allowing facile analyses before and after application . to test whether intracellular cgmp can activate icat cgmp we conducted further patch clamp experiments using cgmp at a lower concentration added to the pipette solution in whole cell recordings . we observed obvious icat cgmp currents in columbia wild type guard cells . icat cgmp was reduced in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant guard cells compared with the columbia wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ indicating that intracellular cgmp is capable of activating icat cgmp and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function in the intracellular cgmp response . note that we can not exclude that an additional _PROTEIN_ gene may be up regulated in these cngc insertion mutant lines or that additional _PROTEIN_ genes contribute to the small average residual currents in _PROTEIN_ double mutant guard cells . however clearly both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function in the establishment of the cgmp activated currents . we also tested the effects of camp added in the pipette solution . we did not observe obvious activation of inward currents in columbia wild type guard cells indicating that camp activation may occur through other channels or at higher camp concentrations . aba triggers _LOCATION_ increases and activates nonselective permeable cation channels in arabidopsis guard cells . similar to icat cgmp aba activated ica channels are permeable to na and . therefore we performed patch clamp experiments to test whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function as aba activated ica channels using as the _PROTEIN_ divalent cation in both bath and pipette solutions as reported previously . genotype blind patch clamp experiments showed that measurable aba activation of ica currents was observed in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ guard cells as well as in columbia wild type guard cells . a small effect of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutation on aba activated ica channel currents could not be excluded based on slightly smaller average currents and an apparent slight shift in the activation potential . the aba insensitive mutants growth controlled by abscisic and abscisic acid _PROTEIN_ show impaired aba activation of ica channel currents . we next analyzed icat cgmp in and _PROTEIN_ mutant guard cells as well as in landsberg _LOCATION_ wild type guard cells and found that cgmp activated icat cgmp currents were not disrupted in and _PROTEIN_ guard cells compared with the landsberg _LOCATION_ wild type . these observations together strongly suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ alone are not essential for aba activated ica channels in arabidopsis guard cells . to further test whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function in aba signaling we pursued aba induced stomatal closure analyses and found that both the columbia wild type and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant showed functional aba induced responses in line with patch clamp analyses . moreover _LOCATION_ has also been shown to play a role in _PROTEIN_ induced stomatal movements . therefore we also addressed _PROTEIN_ induced changes in whole plant stomatal conductance of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ double mutants . the results show that mutation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ did not disrupt _PROTEIN_ induced stomatal closure and opening . moreover light/dark transitions showed similar intact plant stomatal conductances in wild type and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant plants .
