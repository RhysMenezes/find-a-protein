the arabidopsis thaliana k channel family of attpk/kco proteins consists of six members including a single pore and five tandem pore channels . _PROTEIN_ is currently the only ion channel of this family for which a function has been demonstrated in planta . the protein is located at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ forming a voltage independent k channel that is blocked by _LOCATION_ calcium ions . in contrast _PROTEIN_ is a tonoplast localized protein that establishes a k selective voltage independent ion channel activated by _LOCATION_ calcium when _PROTEIN_ in a heterologous system i.e . yeast . here we provide evidence that other attpk/kco channel subunits i.e . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are also targeted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ opening the possibility that they interact at the target _LOCATION_ to form heteromeric ion channels . however when testing the cellular _PROTEIN_ patterns of attpk/kco genes we observed distinct _PROTEIN_ domains that overlap in only a few tissues of the arabidopsis plant making it unlikely that different channel subunits interact to form heteromeric channels . this conclusion was substantiated by in planta _PROTEIN_ of combinations of selected tonoplast attpk/kco proteins . _METHOD_ resonance energy transfer assays indicate that protein interaction occurs between identical channel subunits _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but not between different channel subunits . the finding could be confirmed by bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation assays . we conclude that tonoplast located attpk/kco subunits form homomeric ion channels in vivo .
generally the level of _PROTEIN_ of attpk/kco genes is low and can often not be reliably tested using standard northern blot experiments . therefore gene _PROTEIN_ patterns of attpk/kco genes were previously analysed using real time rt pcr . in these experiments whole seedlings or organs of mature plants such as flowers siliques _METHOD_ rosette leaves and roots were used . within the gene family _PROTEIN_ exhibits the highest transcript level in all tissues analysed followed by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . very low transcript abundance was observed for genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . overall attpk/kco _PROTEIN_ showed relatively poor organ specificity . however both real time rt pcr and promoter reporter gene studies revealed overlapping _PROTEIN_ patterns for some attpk/kco genes i.e . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in root tips of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in vascular tissues and of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in pollen . we previously reported strong _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ encoding a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ two pore k channel in pollen . _PROTEIN_ patterns of attpk/kco genes can also be inferred from microarray hybridization data available through the genevestigator interface . microarray hybridization data indicated that the transcript abundance of attpk/kco genes was low in arabidopsis organs mirroring the _PROTEIN_ data obtained by real time rt pcr . however no information was available for _PROTEIN_ because this gene is not represented by the _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ . a detailed interpretation of attpk/kco _PROTEIN_ data employing the gene atlas gene chronologer and response viewer tools of the genevestigator package revealed the presence of attpk/kco transcripts throughout all plant developmental stages and in different arabidopsis organs like roots _METHOD_ leaves and flowers . as detected in real time rt pcr _PROTEIN_ exhibits the highest transcript level within the gene family in these tissues . furthermore enhanced levels of _PROTEIN_ transcript were recorded in _PROTEIN_ stamen seeds and senescent leaves _PROTEIN_ mrna shows higher abundance in _PROTEIN_ and senescent leaves . in these tissues _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcript abundance mostly exceeded that of the _PROTEIN_ gene . _PROTEIN_ transcripts were detected at an elevated level in rna from stamen _PROTEIN_ and pollen _PROTEIN_ . levels of attpk/kco transcript were not strongly affected by a number of applied biotic or abiotic stresses however the level of _PROTEIN_ transcript increased with abscisic acid treatment and with nitrogen starvation and declined during cold stress . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was induced by methyl jasmonate treatment in microarray experiments . to test the transcriptional activities of attpk/kco promoters we isolated upstream regulatory regions and fused them to the _PROTEIN_ reporter gene . after transformation of a. thaliana with the respective gene constructs the distribution of gus staining was analysed in transgenic plants . previously we have shown in promoter gus studies that _PROTEIN_ is active in different tissues and cell types such as the mesophyll cells and guard cells of leaves the vascular tissue of leaves and roots anthers and pollen grains embryos and roots and hypocotyls of small seedlings . transgenic plants harbouring the fusion construct _PROTEIN_ gus exhibited gus activity in the hypocotyl and root tips of young seedlings in first developing rosette leaves and in anthers . _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ in transgenic plants confers gus activity _PROTEIN_ in pollen grains . detailed analysis of _PROTEIN_ promoter activity in transgenic lines revealed the absence of gus activity during very early stages of flower development . however gus staining was detected at a stage of flower development when buds were still closed . _PROTEIN_ activity was present in the tapetum and _PROTEIN_ on in fully developed pollen grains . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ promoters drove gus _PROTEIN_ in the vascular tissues of leaves roots flower tissues and _METHOD_ as well as in hydathodes . in both cases gus activity in _METHOD_ was higher in apical regions than in basal regions . cross sections of stained tissues indicated gus staining in phloem cells in parenchyma cells of the interfascicular tissue and in developing xylem cells of _METHOD_ leaves flowers and roots . in a few cases gus activity was detectable in pericycle and endodermis cells of roots of _PROTEIN_ gus transgenic lines . it is notable that the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes as demonstrated here employing promoter reporter gene constructs have an almost identical _PROTEIN_ pattern . slight effects in response to external _PROTEIN_ were only observed in the case of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . transgenic plants harbouring an _PROTEIN_ promoter gus fusion construct were generated and tested . no gus activity could be detected in plant tissues after plants were grown under normal growth conditions . to facilitate the investigation of the subcellular localization of attpks and _PROTEIN_ we prepared transgenic plant material _PROTEIN_ translational attpk/kco _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ fusion proteins under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . arabidopsis and tobacco protoplasts _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ fusion proteins were screened via direct imaging of _METHOD_ in living cells . images obtained by confocal laser scanning _METHOD_ microscopy were evaluated from several hundred arabidopsis protoplasts exhibiting both high and low levels of _PROTEIN_ of fusion proteins . the images shown here represent the typical distribution of _METHOD_ in transformed protoplasts . no detectable signal was present in non transgenic protoplasts . the confocal images shown in figure indicate that signals from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins originated from _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of both the central _LOCATION_ and smaller _LOCATION_ present throughout the cells . in some cases fusion proteins also labelled smaller spherical structures so called bulbs that are generally _PROTEIN_ as invaginations of the tonoplast . bulbs were labelled most frequently in protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins . _METHOD_ of fusion proteins was in all cases excluded from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in order to release _LOCATION_ from protoplasts we performed osmotic lysis for protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins . green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ was visible from isolated _LOCATION_ . as control proteins for tonoplast targeting we used _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . no change was observed in the subcellular localization when different _LOCATION_ attpk/kco fusion proteins were co _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts indicating faithful targeting in the presence of other channel proteins belonging to the same family . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ labelled the same _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . however accumulation of _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins in additional internal _LOCATION_ was visible in several experiments . in contrast to the proteins studied here _PROTEIN_ has previously been shown to be targeted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . obvious structural differences between _PROTEIN_ and other attpk/kco subunits are the presence of binding motifs in n termini and binding ef hand motifs in c termini of the _LOCATION_ proteins . recently it has been shown for animal two pore channels that the interaction with protein enables forward trafficking of the channel subunits to target _LOCATION_ . in plants protein interacts with from barley as demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance and with _PROTEIN_ as shown by two hybrid assays . whether protein interaction is also necessary for trafficking and targeting of attpk/kco channel proteins is unclear at present . in the case of alpha tonoplast intrinsic protein the c terminus of the protein is known to be important for targeting and _PROTEIN_ enhanced stability of the protein . recent studies elucidated that utilizes a _LOCATION_ independent pathway to protein storage _LOCATION_ and identified _PROTEIN_ as a protein interacting with a targeting motif in the cytoplasmic c terminus of specific for this _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ pathway . however no general targeting sequence for tonoplast proteins is known so far . because members of the attpk/kco family serve functions in either the _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ they might be ideal candidates for studying tonoplast targeting processes in detail . results from promoter reporter studies indicate an almost identical _PROTEIN_ pattern for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ variation for _PROTEIN_ is possible in response to external _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ shows the highest transcript level within the gene family in several plant tissues and throughout all plant developmental stages potentially allowing protein association with other members of the protein family . in addition _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were clearly detected in the tonoplast . we therefore selected _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for analyses of channel subunit associations . to investigate whether subunits of _LOCATION_ attpk/kco channels form homo or heteromeric complexes we studied protein protein interactions in transgenic cells using in vivo fret and bifc . c terminal _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusions of each channel subunit were co _PROTEIN_ in onion epidermal cells which provide a natural spatial fixation on slide discs during microscopic observation that is essential for fret analysis using acceptor bleaching . as in arabidopsis protoplasts fusion proteins of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ target to the tonoplast and label the large central _LOCATION_ and smaller _LOCATION_ in the cells . _METHOD_ resonance energy transfer apb was applied to record fret as it prevents _METHOD_ associated with variable _PROTEIN_ levels . for each pair of constructs tested data were recorded from at least sample sites in at least transformed cells _PROTEIN_ usually sample sites in transformed cells were analysed . _METHOD_ resonance energy transfer apb efficiency was calculated after acceptor bleaching of either the whole cell area or of distinct parts of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . figure shows a confocal image of a cell co _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with indicated areas of analysis . mean fret apb efficiencies of were obtained for energy transfer between _PROTEIN_ subunits . similar fret signals were obtained for _PROTEIN_ homomeric subunit interactions . energy transfer between _PROTEIN_ subunits was less prominent indicating a less favourable orientation of the _METHOD_ fluorophores for energy transfer presumably caused by a larger distance of the subunit molecules or c termini in a possible _PROTEIN_ dimer . importantly energy transfer between heteromeric combinations was clearly reduced to background level _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . mean fret apb efficiency was calculated for channel subunit combinations with swapped donor and acceptor fluorophores . similar low level fret signals were recorded in control experiments with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and free _METHOD_ . the background fret signal in cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ is probably due to dimer formation of the two fluorophores at very high protein concentrations . this tendency of all _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ to dimerize could also influence the dimerization of investigated _LOCATION_ proteins . however it was shown that a mutation in _METHOD_ virtually eliminated the homoaffinity of the _METHOD_ protein and the mutated protein was successfully used in fret experiments in living cells . to exclude false positive fret signals we studied the subunit interaction for _PROTEIN_ fused to mutated _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ respectively . we performed site directed mutagenesis in _PROTEIN_ constructs to include non sticky _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in our studies . as shown in figure mean apb efficiencies of were obtained for energy transfer between _PROTEIN_ subunits fused to non sticky _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . control experiments with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ resulted in low energy transfer levels . this result indicates that fret occurs due to protein interaction between _PROTEIN_ subunits and does not result from interactions between _METHOD_ proteins with high homoaffinity . taking into account that typical fret apb efficiencies for protein interaction pairs range from clear subunit interaction could be detected only when homomeric combinations of the attpk/kco channel proteins were co _PROTEIN_ . co _PROTEIN_ of heteromeric subunit combinations strongly _PROTEIN_ fret apb efficiency . to prove the dimerization of _LOCATION_ attpk/kco subunits we additionally performed bifc assays . the _METHOD_ complex which is formed by two non _METHOD_ fragments of the _METHOD_ is restored through the association of interacting proteins e.g . attpk/kco subunits fused to these fragments . as a positive control for our studies we used constructs enabling the interaction of _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ . we transiently transformed protoplasts from tobacco and arabidopsis suspension cells with homomeric and heteromeric attpk/kco subunit combinations . yellow _METHOD_ protein signals could be obtained when _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ subunits were co transformed as homomers . no _METHOD_ or only background _METHOD_ could be observed in control protoplasts which were transformed with single plasmids or with any combination of empty vectors . homodimerization induced _METHOD_ _METHOD_ appeared in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ confirming the observation that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ homomers locate to the tonoplast . _PROTEIN_ of heteromeric combinations of the selected proteins resulted in diffuse _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in non target compartments _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of protoplasts . the intensity of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ varied strongly ranging from a level close to background to a level seen in protoplasts _PROTEIN_ attpk/kco homomers . we never observed _METHOD_ _METHOD_ clearly associated with the tonoplast even after h of incubation indicating that no interaction of heteromers occurs at the target _LOCATION_ . it has been reported that _METHOD_ fragments tend to establish non specific interactions at high levels of protein _PROTEIN_ . it has been estimated that _METHOD_ complementation can occur when _METHOD_ fragments are separated by an average distance of more than nm as long as there is sufficient flexibility to allow association of the fragments . _METHOD_ detected in heteromeric attpk/kco combinations could therefore result from an initial association and subsequent permanent coupling via the restored _METHOD_ and partial degradation of such incorrect multimers by the cellular quality control system . although identification of positive homomer interaction in bifc analyses is clearly detectable no quantitative information about complex formation can be obtained . as we also used protoplasts from arabidopsis suspension cells unmodified interaction partners can compete with bimolecular interaction complexes . both fret and bifc analyses strongly support the existence of attpk/kco channels as homomers theoretically as dimers _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or as tetramers _PROTEIN_ in the tonoplast . in our experimental conditions only homomeric combinations allowed the detection of fret between the channel subunits or restoration of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ at the tonoplast . similar fret apb efficiencies were detected for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ homomeric combinations whereas the energy transfer efficiency was somewhat lower between _PROTEIN_ subunits possibly reflecting a larger distance between _PROTEIN_ channel subunits or their c termini . also the bifc analysis clearly detected _PROTEIN_ homomers . homomeric complexes of either tonoplast _PROTEIN_ or _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ subunits respectively have been proven to be functionally active in electrophysiological studies . the overall interpretation of these results has to take into account that for fret in a two dimensional space like a biological _LOCATION_ the orientation of the _METHOD_ proteins could be more relevant than for fret occurring in a three dimensional space such as the _LOCATION_ . furthermore for the bifc analysis it is expected that orientation effects are less problematic for homomer complementation than for heteromer complementation in a _LOCATION_ . in heteromer associations the separation between the _METHOD_ proteins _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ could be different resulting in less or no _METHOD_ restoration even if heteromers exist . also for fret an offset in height of _METHOD_ proteins relative to the _LOCATION_ in a heteromer which is absent for the homomer can result in a reduced fret efficiency . yet this offset should be very substantial in order to explain our negative heteromer results . if so our analysis proves the existence of homomeric attpk/kco combinations but does not fully exclude that heteromers still exist .
the original nomenclature of the protein family was _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ . because of different functional properties of some of the family members _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ citation suggested renaming the channel proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . this new nomenclature has already been used in subsequent publications . arabidopsis thaliana heynh . cv . col wild type and transgenic plants were grown in half concentrated murashige skoog _METHOD_ medium supplemented with sucrose and solidified with agarose under a h day h night regime or in soil _METHOD_ . transgenic a. thaliana plants were generated by vacuum infiltration with agrobacterium tumefaciens strain . kanamycin or hygromycin resistant plants were identified and grown from seeds . experiments were conducted with or plants and two to four independent lines each of the generation were selected for detailed analysis of gus activity . cell cultures were grown at with shaking in darkness . particle bombardment was used to introduce the attpk/kco _METHOD_ fusion plasmids into onion epidermal cells with a biolistic _PROTEIN_ system . onions were obtained from a local supermarket and the epidermal pieces were placed on agar plates containing _METHOD_ gold particles were coated with the respective plasmid dna . gold aliquots were incubated with of dna of m sperimidine and of m washed and resuspended in ethanol . for one shot dna per plasmid coated on gold was used . the onion epidermal pieces were bombarded using p.s.i . rupture discs under vacuum . after bombardment the onion epidermal pieces were kept in darkness at for h on media plates . the fusion constructs were introduced into a. thaliana protoplasts prepared from cell culture . the materials were incubated with enzyme solution at in darkness with gentle shaking for h. purification of the resulting protoplasts was done using a percoll or sucrose gradient . for transformation a polyethylene glycol mediated procedure was used . bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation constructs were introduced into tobacco protoplasts and arabidopsis protoplasts as described . protoplasts were analysed for _METHOD_ h after transformation . _LOCATION_ were isolated according to citation . standard pcr reactions and sub cloning procedures were used to engineer _PROTEIN_ and attpk sequences into clones described below . complementary dna clones were isolated from cdna preparations from seedlings or flowers of a. thaliana . complementary dnas were cloned into plasmid pcr script or _PROTEIN_ . sequence determination was done for each construct . c terminal _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusion constructs were created using _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ and sub cloning of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusion constructs into . bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation constructs have been generated using the puc _PROTEIN_ and puc _PROTEIN_ . attpk/kco gus fusion constructs were generated using plant _PROTEIN_ vectors _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and pcambia _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . regions containing the promoter and parts of the first translated exon of attpk/kco genes were transcriptionally fused to the gus gene . the _PROTEIN_ gus construct was described in citation . details about cloning strategies are given in supplementary appendix . fusion constructs _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were mutated to alter amino acid codon in _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ coding sequences respectively using the primers _METHOD_ .seq _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ .rev _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ .seq _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ .rev _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . a silent mutation in of both the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ coding sequences inserted a hindiii restriction site in the mutagenized sequences . mutagenesis was performed using the flipflop site directed mutagenesis kit . sequence determination was done for each construct . or seedlings or plants of transgenic a. thaliana lines were used for histochemical analysis . staining for gus activity was done as described . plant tissues were incubated in staining solution at for h. cells were settled onto clean glass slides covered with _METHOD_ medium under glass cover slips . images were obtained by conventional microscopy using a confocal laser scanning microscope using a water objective lens . _METHOD_ was observed using emission filter sets of nm _METHOD_ nm _METHOD_ and nm _METHOD_ . excitation was achieved with an ar/hene laser at nm _METHOD_ nm _METHOD_ and nm _METHOD_ . acceptor photobleaching experiments were performed using the leica application package fret acceptor bleaching . cells were bleached in the acceptor _METHOD_ channel by scanning a roi using the nm laser at to _PROTEIN_ the signal intensity to . calculation of the fret efficiency on selected _LOCATION_ pieces was done as described by citation . images were arranged using adobe photoshop _METHOD_ .
