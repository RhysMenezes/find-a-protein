the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ gene encodes a _LOCATION_ double stranded rna binding protein . a knockout mutation of the _PROTEIN_ gene is recessive and pleiotropic causing developmental abnormalities increasing sensitivity to abscisic acid and reducing sensitivity to auxin and cytokinin . we report that levels of several micrornas _PROTEIN_ are reduced in homozygous mutant plants and levels of two of three tested target mrnas are elevated . conversely the mirna levels are elevated in plants _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ cdna from a strong promoter and the corresponding target rnas are reduced . these changes result from alterations in the stability of the target rnas . however double stranded rna induced posttranscriptional gene silencing is unaffected by the _PROTEIN_ mutation . one third to one half of the cellular _PROTEIN_ protein is in a macromolecular complex and a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein is found predominantly in the _LOCATION_ although it is observed in both _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm in some cells . within _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ is associated with subnuclear bodies and _PROTEIN_ like structures . these observations provide evidence that the _PROTEIN_ protein is part of a _LOCATION_ macromolecular complex that is involved in mirna mediated gene regulation . because _PROTEIN_ mutants show marked abnormalities in hormone responses these results further suggest that mirna mediated changes in mrna stability play a vital role in plant hormone signaling .
_PROTEIN_ affects mirna and target transcript levels . to determine whether mirna levels are affected by the supply of _PROTEIN_ protein we performed northern blot hybridization analyses on several known mirnas _PROTEIN_ in rna preparations from month old wild type plants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants and transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ an _PROTEIN_ cdna from a cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . _PROTEIN_ protein was undetectable in homozygous _PROTEIN_ plants and was fold more abundant in _PROTEIN_ plants than in wild type plants . all three mirnas tested were less abundant in both mutant plants and more abundant in _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants than in wild type plants . to exclude the possibility that the low mirna levels are an indirect effect of the _PROTEIN_ mutation on _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene we used rt pcr to check the _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ level in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the _PROTEIN_ transcript level which is also controlled by an mirna is higher in the _PROTEIN_ mutant than it is in either wild type plants or _PROTEIN_ plants indicating that the low mirna levels are not attributable to misexpression of the _PROTEIN_ gene . the correlation between the levels of the mirnas tested and _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ suggests that _PROTEIN_ is involved in mirna metabolism . because mirnas can regulate gene _PROTEIN_ by means of transcript destabilization we first asked whether the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels affect steady state levels of predicted targets of the tested mirnas . those tested were auxin response _PROTEIN_ for the scarecrow like gene iii for and _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ . we used pcr amplified cdna fragments of each target gene to probe northern blots prepared with mrna isolated from wild type plants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants and _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants . all three of the predicted target genes were _PROTEIN_ at higher levels in the _PROTEIN_ mutant and two of the three were _PROTEIN_ at higher levels in _PROTEIN_ mutant than in wild type plants . moreover transcripts of all three target genes were less abundant in _PROTEIN_ plants than in wild type plants implying an inverse relationship between the _PROTEIN_ level and the target transcript level . target rna stability . to determine whether the steady state levels of target transcripts were a reflection of differences in their degradation rates week old wild type _PROTEIN_ mutant and _PROTEIN_ plants were treated with cordycepin to inhibit rna synthesis then collected at various times for rna extraction and quantification of transcript levels by rt pcr . fig ref shows the results obtained for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and iii mirna targets as well as _PROTEIN_ a mitogen activated protein kinase kinase kinase gene that is not predicted to be mirna regulated . results for the four genes are quantified and normalized for direct comparison in fig ref . consistent with northern blot data mrna levels are higher in the _PROTEIN_ mutant than in wild type seedlings for the mirna targets but not the _PROTEIN_ mrna . all of the mrnas are degraded more slowly in _PROTEIN_ mutants and more rapidly in _PROTEIN_ than in wild type seedlings with the most marked differences detected for the _PROTEIN_ and iii genes . by contrast _PROTEIN_ is degraded relatively slowly and at comparable rates in mutant wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants . the mrna decay curves seem to be biphasic in some cases with an initial rapid degradation rate and a subsequent slower rate . thus for example the initial rate is similar in wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants but subsequently _PROTEIN_ in wildtype and _PROTEIN_ plants . moreover it _METHOD_ to decline sooner in the _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type plants . although little is known about the quantitative relationships between mirnas and their targets in plants the present observations suggest that when rna synthesis is interrupted by cordycepin the supply of mirna determines the initial decay rate until it is exhausted after which the rna decay rate reverts to a basal non mirna rate . this is consistent with the results of recent studies on rhyb a small bacterial regulatory rna which revealed a stoichiometric relationship between the regulatory rna and its target with which it is degraded . dsrna mediated _PROTEIN_ is not compromised in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . to further inquire into the function of the _PROTEIN_ protein we asked whether the dsrna mediated _PROTEIN_ mechanism is affected by the _PROTEIN_ mutation . the possibility that _PROTEIN_ is involved in _PROTEIN_ is raised by the observation that rde and the closest homologs of _PROTEIN_ are involved in rna interference in c. elegans and drosophila respectively . we asked whether the _PROTEIN_ of two foreign genes firefly luc and a bacterial gus gene _PROTEIN_ from the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter could be inhibited by homologous dsrna . we transfected the plasmids carrying the promoter driven gus and luc genes into protoplasts prepared from wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant arabidopsis plants . we used in vitro synthesized nt dsrnas corresponding to the coding sequence of the reporter gene to silence the transgenes . fig ref shows that the luc dsrna effectively inhibits luc _PROTEIN_ of the cotransfected luc gene demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ is triggered by dsrna in protoplasts . similar experiments were carried out in _PROTEIN_ protoplasts by using both luc and a gus plasmids and dsrna homologous to each . the homologous dsrna inhibited gene _PROTEIN_ in mutant protoplasts whereas the heterologous dsrna did not . thus sequence specific _PROTEIN_ by dsrna is not compromised by the _PROTEIN_ mutation . it remains to be determined whether the _PROTEIN_ mutation affects other aspects of _PROTEIN_ . subcellular distribution of _PROTEIN_ . we previously reported that _PROTEIN_ concentrates in the _LOCATION_ of transfected onion epidermal cells . to gain further insight into the subcellular distribution of the _PROTEIN_ protein we made a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ translational fusion and used confocal microscopy to analyze arabidopsis protoplasts _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein . the fusion protein was shown to be functional by stably transforming the fusion construct into _PROTEIN_ mutant plants and showing that it rescues the mutant phenotype . although _PROTEIN_ is concentrated in the _LOCATION_ in most cells in some cells it is also observed in the cytoplasm where it has a somewhat patchy distribution . among protoplasts analyzed in detail showed _METHOD_ only in _LOCATION_ whereas the remaining exhibited _METHOD_ in both _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm . within the _LOCATION_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein is frequently observed to concentrate in two subnuclear structures small bodies and _PROTEIN_ . most of the small _LOCATION_ bodies had diameters but a few were in diameter or even larger . _PROTEIN_ like structures usually had diameters of . among the protoplasts with subnuclear structures contained _PROTEIN_ and contained subnuclear bodies . one of these cells had both a _PROTEIN_ and several small bodies . it should also be noted that although hyl _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was occasionally observed to be cytoplasmic in all three of the transfections experiments the cytoplasmic distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ differed from that of _METHOD_ controls giving a rather patchy appearance in contrast to the uniform cytoplasmic _METHOD_ observed with _METHOD_ controls . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ is in macromolecular complexes we analyzed protein extracts of wild type cells by using blue native gel electrophoresis . when the complexes were further resolved in a denaturing gel _PROTEIN_ was detected in the kda complex as well as in the major band migrating somewhat more slowly than the kda marker . these correspond to complexed and free _PROTEIN_ respectively and one third to one half of the immunologically detectable _PROTEIN_ protein was in the complex . a minor band detected with anti _PROTEIN_ antibody migrating slightly more slowly than the kda marker on the blue native gel did not contain a protein that comigrates with _PROTEIN_ on the denaturing gel and hence is attributable to an immunologically crossreacting protein . a similar distribution of free and complexed proteins has been detected by gel filtration chromatography . thus about one half of the _PROTEIN_ protein is present in a high molecular weight complex whereas the remainder appears to be free . in summary we have presented evidence that the supply of _PROTEIN_ dsrna binding protein affects the abundance of several mirnas and their predicted target rnas . the stability of the target rna is inversely proportional to the level of _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ whereas the abundance of the corresponding mirna is directly correlated with _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ and protein abundance although some residual mirna was detected in the _PROTEIN_ null mutant for all of the sequences tested . differences in the _PROTEIN_ protein level affect mirna metabolism and mrna stability but not dsrna mediated _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is predominantly a _LOCATION_ protein and is detected in _LOCATION_ bodies and _PROTEIN_ like structures reminiscent of cajal or coiled bodies known to be involved in _LOCATION_ rna processing in association with the nucleolus . one third to one half of the _PROTEIN_ protein in crude extracts is in the form of an kda complex . these observations imply that the _PROTEIN_ protein is in a macromolecular complex involved in mirna metabolism and further suggest that some aspects of mirna metabolism occurs in the _LOCATION_ possibly in association with perinucleolar rna processing bodies . studies are underway to determine the nature of the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ containing _PROTEIN_ and bodies . because the levels of several different mirnas and their target rnas are affected by the _PROTEIN_ level of the _PROTEIN_ gene albeit to different extents the _PROTEIN_ protein _METHOD_ to be involved in a common aspect of mirna metabolism . the _PROTEIN_ that mirnas are present at low levels in the null _PROTEIN_ mutant suggests that the protein is not essential for mirna biogenesis . although this may be attributable to redundancy or degeneracy in the constituents of the mirna processing machinery another possibility is that _PROTEIN_ regulates the stability of a processing or degradation intermediate . this is supported by the observation that target mrna stability can be substantially reduced in the _PROTEIN_ overexpresser even when the mirna level is not markedly enhanced _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ mutant exhibits a number of developmental abnormalities many of which are associated with underlying defects in hormonal signaling or responses . rapid transient increases in transcript levels are a common early response to changes in hormone levels . the iii _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are all proteins that are either known or likely transcriptional regulators mediating hormone responses . it was recently reported that although overexpression of the _PROTEIN_ gene itself had no discernible phenotypic effect overexpression of a gene mutated to reduce homology to _PROTEIN_ gave plants that have the hyponastic leaf phenotype from which the _PROTEIN_ mutant derives its name implying that the developmental abnormality results not from overexpression of the gene but from inability to degrade the mrna . the results of the present studies suggest that mirna mediated regulation of mrna stability may be as important a regulatory mechanism in the rapid hormone induced changes in transcript levels as protein destabilization .
