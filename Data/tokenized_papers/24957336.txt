peptidoglycans _PROTEIN_ are immunogenic bacterial surface patterns that trigger immune activation in metazoans and plants . it is generally unknown how complex bacterial structures such as _PROTEIN_ are perceived by plant pattern recognition receptors and whether host hydrolytic activities facilitate decomposition of bacterial _PROTEIN_ and generation of soluble prr ligands . here we show that arabidopsis thaliana upon bacterial infection or exposure to microbial patterns produces a metazoan lysozyme like hydrolase . activity releases soluble _PROTEIN_ fragments from insoluble bacterial cell walls and cleavage products are able to trigger responses typically associated with plant immunity . importantly mutant genotypes exhibit super susceptibility to bacterial infections similar to that observed on _PROTEIN_ receptor mutants . we propose that plants employ hydrolytic activities for the decomposition of complex bacterial structures and that soluble pattern generation might aid prr mediated immune activation in cell layers adjacent to infection sites . doi http
soluble oligomeric _PROTEIN_ fragments have previously been shown to stimulate plant immune responses in arabidopsis . as some metazoan pgrps harbor _PROTEIN_ degrading enzyme activities we tested whether recombinant arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ binding proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were able to catalyze _PROTEIN_ degradation . for this we have employed a standard lysozyme assay that is based on reduced turbidity in suspensions of gram positive micrococcus luteus cell wall preparations due to _PROTEIN_ degradation . _PROTEIN_ degrading activity of hen egg white lysozyme served as a positive control in these assays . as shown in lysozyme but not recombinant _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ displayed cell wall degrading lytic activity suggesting that the latter are unable to release _PROTEIN_ fragments from bacterial cell walls . this is in agreement with a lack of sequence similarities between _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ and known metazoan _PROTEIN_ hydrolytic activities . we therefore conclude that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ constitute plant _PROTEIN_ sensors that appear to be functionally related to non enzymatic mammalian or drosophila pgrps arabidopsis lysozyme gene is transcriptionally activated upon pathogen infection . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ do not possess peptidoglycan _PROTEIN_ hydrolytic activity . micrococcus luteus cell wall preparations were incubated with

hydrolyze linkages between n acetylmuramic acid and n acetylglucosamine residues in _PROTEIN_ and between n acetylglucosamine residues in chitodextrins . plant genomes do not encode lysozyme like proteins but many plant species produce lysozyme like enzyme activities such as chitinases . plant chitinases fall into five classes and are grouped into structurally unrelated families and of glycosyl hydrolases respectively . chitinases belonging to family of glycosyl hydrolases are ubiquitously found in all _METHOD_ whereas chitinases of glycosyl hydrolase family are found almost exclusively in plants . class iii chitinases represent bifunctional plant enzymes with lysozyme like activities . one such enzyme hevamine from the rubber tree hevea brasiliensis has been shown to hydrolyze _PROTEIN_ and the structurally closely related linked glcnac homopolymer chitin in vitro . to explore host mediated _PROTEIN_ degradation and its possible implication in plant immune activation we have addressed the only class iii chitinase encoded by the arabidopsis genome . bacterial infection of arabidopsis plants stably _PROTEIN_ a gus construct revealed that gene _PROTEIN_ is enhanced upon infection with host non _PROTEIN_ pseudomonas syringae pv . phaseolicola or disarmed host _PROTEIN_ p. syringae pv . tomato . likewise _PROTEIN_ of the immune response marker pathogenesis related protein _PROTEIN_ was enhanced by the same treatment . failure to detect _PROTEIN_ in plants infected with virulent host _PROTEIN_ pto suggests bacterial effector mediated suppression that is reminiscent of that observed for _PROTEIN_ receptor proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as well as numerous other immunity associated genes . gene _PROTEIN_ is not only triggered upon bacterial infection but was also observed upon treatment with different mamps including bacterial flagellin lps or _PROTEIN_ preparations similar to the immune marker gene flagellin responsive kinase _PROTEIN_ . altogether infection induced transcriptional activation suggests that the protein is implicated in immunity to bacterial infection . to analyze the enzymatic properties of recombinant protein production was attempted . overexpression in escherichia coli failed to produce active enzyme and production in eukaryotic pichia pastoris entirely failed to produce recombinant protein . therefore we resorted to generate _METHOD_ overexpressing plants . notably _METHOD_ was glycosylated possibly explaining the failure to produce enzymatically active protein in e. coli . _PROTEIN_ of the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion protein in arabidopsis plants was accompanied by substantial proteolytic cleavage resulting in the predominant release of a protein with an approximate molecular _METHOD_ of kda most likely representing untagged . analysis of this major cleavage product by liquid chromatography _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ after tryptic in gel digestion and by peptide _METHOD_ fingerprint not only confirmed the identity of in this band but also yielded peptides spanning the whole protein sequence except for the first amino acids thus indicating cleavage of the

however neither the insertion in the untranslated region nor the insertions in the first intron and at the end of the last exon of the coding region abolished formation of the transcript . as an alternative to knock out lines knock down lines were produced by artificial micro rna technology . as proven by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction we obtained two genetically

revealed that signals co localized to a large extent with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . thus likely operates in close vicinity of the plant surface . indeed previous identification within the arabidopsis cell wall proteome suggests that acts in the plant apoplast . since the plant apoplast is an acidic compartment we investigated whether is active at physiologically relevant ph conditions . for this the m. luteus cell wall degrading activity of an leaf extract was determined at different ph values . although active at ph values ranging from to a pronounced maximum of activity was

to exhibit activity on cellobiose as a substrate indicating it might have no cellulose activity . thus resembles enzymatic activities reported for metazoan lysozymes and should be classified as lysozyme instead of chitinase . to analyze immunogenic activities of _PROTEIN_ cleavage products generated by untagged was purified from arabidopsis lines by _METHOD_ and used for degradation of b. subtilis _PROTEIN_ . solubilized _PROTEIN_ fragments found in the supernatant of digested _PROTEIN_ were subsequently analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography . only a few peaks could be detected in the supernatant of _PROTEIN_ incubated with a buffer control or with heat inactivated . in contrast _PROTEIN_ digests produced by native yielded several characteristic peaks that were also detectable in the supernatants of _PROTEIN_ preparations treated with mutanolysin which has been shown to cleave o glycosidic bonds between glcnac and murnac residues in complex _PROTEIN_ . generated _PROTEIN_ fragments were subsequently tested for their ability to trigger plant immunity associated responses . first supernatants of _PROTEIN_ preparations treated with either native or heat denatured were used to trigger immune marker gene _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis seedlings . importantly only supernatants from _PROTEIN_ digests produced by native or mutanolysin induced

complex _PROTEIN_ . as shown in release of immunogenic _PROTEIN_ fragments into solution occurred rapidly within min of incubation with native . incubation of complex _PROTEIN_ with yielded the highest immunogenic activity of the digest supernatant after min suggesting that at that time point the maximum amount of immunogenic _PROTEIN_ fragments was generated . however prolonged incubation with again resulted in a loss of activity with overnight digestion completely abolishing stimulatory activity of the _PROTEIN_ digest . we assume that is capable of releasing immunogenic fragments from complex _PROTEIN_ but extensive or complete digest into _PROTEIN_ monomers or small _PROTEIN_ fragments appears to abolish the immunogenic activity of _PROTEIN_ fragments . this result is in accordance with our previous observations that prolonged digestion of _PROTEIN_ with mutanolysin diminishes its defense inducing activity . to examine the physiological role of in plant immunity and lines were subjected to infection with various phytopathogens . as harbors chitinase activity and as transcripts accumulate upon fungal infection we first analyzed the role of in immunity towards fungal infection . leaves of transgenic or lines and wild type plants were infected with the necrotrophic fungus botrytis cinerea and disease _METHOD_ were monitored days post infection . fungal hyphal growth and necrotic leaf lesions at infection sites were detectable in all plant lines tested and hyphal outgrowth or cell death lesion sizes revealed no differences between wild type or lines

trypan blue staining and microscopic analysis of the infection sites did not reveal major differences in fungal hyphal growth among all lines tested . although disease indices at day after infection were slightly increased in lines such subtle differences were not statistically significant . in conclusion we failed to detect a role for in immunity to fungal infection with b. cinerea and a.

that observed on wild type plants . _PROTEIN_ transcript accumulation upon administration of complex _PROTEIN_ was also strongly reduced in overexpressors . to exclude a direct effect of overexpression on _PROTEIN_ receptor abundance we examined transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but found no effect on the transcription of these receptor genes in the lines . also _PROTEIN_ protein levels were unaltered in the lines whereas there was no _PROTEIN_ protein detectable in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . moreover we included the line with only moderately increased transcript and protein levels in mature leaves . susceptibility to pseudomonas infection in the line was only slightly but not significantly increased . these results indicate that lowering _PROTEIN_ levels accompanied by lower hydrolytic activity on _PROTEIN_ brings down these lines close to wild type . thus _METHOD_ overexpression and loss of function mutations are phenocopies of each other irrespective of the _PROTEIN_ that and lines show dramatic differences in enzymatic activities . altogether we propose that contributes to plant immunity to bacterial infection by decomposition of bacterial _PROTEIN_ and generation of soluble _PROTEIN_ derived patterns that trigger immune activation in a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ receptor complex dependent manner .
