the photoreceptor phytochrome a has a well defined role in regulating gene _PROTEIN_ in response to specific light signals . here we describe a new arabidopsis mutant _PROTEIN_ that has an elongated hypocotyl specifically under far red light . gene _PROTEIN_ studies showed that _PROTEIN_ has reduced responsiveness to continuous far red light but retains wild type responses to other light wavelengths . as far red light is only perceived by _PROTEIN_ our results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is specifically involved in _PROTEIN_ signal transduction . further analyses revealed is affected in a subset of _PROTEIN_ dependent responses and the phenotype is more severe at low far red fluence rates . _PROTEIN_ a _LOCATION_ protein with strong homology with the myb family of dna binding proteins . experiments using yeast cells identified a transactivation domain in the c terminal portion of the protein . _PROTEIN_ is constitutively targeted to the _LOCATION_ by signals in its n terminal portion and the full length protein accumulates in distinct _LOCATION_ speckles . this accumulation in speckles is abolished by a point mutation in a lysine residue which might serve as a modification site by a small ubiquitin like protein .
to identify genes involved in the _PROTEIN_ signal transduction pathway we screened a collection of independent arabidopsis gene trap lines which were generated using the ds based system ofcitation . mutants with elongated hypocotyls under fr light and/or resistance to fr light induced killing were selected . the progeny of putative mutants was tested under continuous fr and red light conditions and only mutants with long hypocotyls under fr light were considered to be specifically impaired in _PROTEIN_ signaling . here we describe the isolation and characterization of one such mutant . the mutant _PROTEIN_ is defective in several seedling responses when grown under continuous fr light . fr suppresses hypocotyl elongation in both the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ mutant but this response was reduced significantly in the latter . in contrast a _PROTEIN_ photoreceptor mutant _PROTEIN_ is completely blind to fr resulting in long hypocotyls under these conditions . the suppression of hypocotyl elongation in r white and blue light was not altered in _PROTEIN_ . mutant seedlings also showed a normal etiolated phenotype when grown in the dark . the ability to green in white light after a prolonged fr light treatment is a specific feature of mutants defective in the _PROTEIN_ photoreceptor or blocked in _PROTEIN_ signaling . we tested _PROTEIN_ for its ability to green after exposure to different fluencies of fr light . at fr fluencies lower than sec _PROTEIN_ seedlings were resistant to the fr induced killing whereas under fluencies higher than sec they were sensitive and died . this is in contrast with wt seedlings which were sensitive to fr fluencies even lower than sec . under fr light wt plants synthesize anthocyanin whereas _PROTEIN_ mutants are blocked in this process . we tested for anthocyanin accumulation in _PROTEIN_ seedlings grown under three different fr fluencies . was able to synthesize anthocyanin under all three light conditions the levels were reduced by compared with wt . we also examined other seedling responses triggered specifically by _PROTEIN_ such as fr dependent apical hook opening cotyledon unfolding and expansion and gravitropism . these responses were not altered in _PROTEIN_ in comparison with wt over a range of fluencies . furthermore there was no obvious adult phenotype in _PROTEIN_ plants other than the _PROTEIN_ that mutant plants appear to have a slightly shorter inflorescence than wt . this did not affect the flowering time of _PROTEIN_ which was very similar to that of the wt when measured under long day conditions . the loss of responsiveness to fr observed in _PROTEIN_ could in principle result from a reduction in _PROTEIN_ levels or spectral activity . no difference in _PROTEIN_ protein levels between wt and _PROTEIN_ was observed in etiolated seedlings and the mutation is not linked to the _PROTEIN_ locus . these results together with the _PROTEIN_ that _PROTEIN_ is impaired only in some fr light/phya specific responses indicate that the mutant is not compromised in the perception of fr light but rather in the transduction of its signal . genetic analysis showed that the mutant phenotype cosegregated with the kanamycin resistance marker present on the singleds insertion . backcrosses established that the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype was recessive . the mutation was located on chromosome iv and does not correspond to any other mutation that produces a fr specific long hypocotyl phenotype _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we used the ds tag in _PROTEIN_ to clone locus . the nucleotide sequence flanking the insertion was identical to that of a region on chromosome iv containing an orf that corresponds to a myb gene previously identified . after isolation of the cdna by rt pcr and its comparison to the genomic sequence deposited in the database by the arabidopsisgenome initiative we determined that the _PROTEIN_ gene contained three exons and two introns . theds element was inserted in the third exon at nucleotide position from the translation start point . the _PROTEIN_ gene encodes a protein of amino acids with two myb domains located at the n terminal region . each myb domain consists of an amino acid helix turn helix motif and each contains tryptophan residues in characteristic positions . in these respects _PROTEIN_ is similar to the two repeat myb proteins more than members of which so far have been identified in thearabidopsis genome . overall _PROTEIN_ is most similar to _PROTEIN_ fromarabidopsis whose function is unknown . the steady state level of the _PROTEIN_ transcript is very low . reverse northern analysis described by citationindicated no strong induction of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ after treatment with hormones or elicitors or exposure to abiotic stresses . the only tissues in which weak _PROTEIN_ could be detected were cauline leaves . using northern blot hybridization with poly rna from cauline leaves of wt plants we could detect a single band of nucleotides which corresponds to the appropriate size of cdna . no _PROTEIN_ transcript could be detected mutant plants even with rt pcr suggesting is a true null mutant . to test for complementation we transformed _PROTEIN_ with either a _PROTEIN_ genomic dna or a _PROTEIN_ under the control of a promoter . seven independent transgenic lines from each transformation experiment were characterized . figure shows representative transgenic lines which display wt hypocotyl lengths under low and high fr fluencies showing complementation of the mutant phenotype . interestingly plants overexpressing the _PROTEIN_ gene do not show any clear phenotype under any analyzed light conditions although the transcript levels are elevated . the third exon of the _PROTEIN_ gene which shows no high sequence homology with any other gene in the databank was cloned in the antisense orientation under the control of a promoter and this _PROTEIN_ cassette was transferred into wt plants . four antisense transgenic lines showed hypocotyl lengths fold longer than wt under fr light but wt hypocotyl lengths under white r and b light and in darkness . together these results confirm that indeed the disruption of the _PROTEIN_ gene is responsible for the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype . regulation of developmental processes requires fine tuning of gene _PROTEIN_ regulating cell elongation and cell differentiation . previous pharmacological experiments in tomato and soybean cells have indicated that _PROTEIN_ regulates gene _PROTEIN_ by at least three pathways a cgmp dependent pathway mediating _PROTEIN_ synthase _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ a /calmodulin dependent pathway that is necessary for chlorophyll a/b binding protein and ribulosebisphosphate _PROTEIN_ small subunit _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ and a third pathway which requires both cgmp and /calmodulin to induce plastocyanin and ferredoxin nadp oxidoreductase gene _PROTEIN_ . to locate the site of action of _PROTEIN_ we performed northern blot hybridizations with _PROTEIN_ cab and pet eprobes by using _PROTEIN_ seedlings grown in the dark followed by exposure to different fr fluencies for h. shows that the _PROTEIN_ levels of all three target genes were reduced in the _PROTEIN_ mutant compared with wt . however the reduction was not as severe as that of thephya mutant which was used as a control . these results confirm the morphological phenotype under fr light showing is deficient in _PROTEIN_ signaling over a wide range of fluencies . we also analyzed the _PROTEIN_ of cab _PROTEIN_ induced by either r or fr light . cab gene _PROTEIN_ is reduced under fr light conditions in the _PROTEIN_ mutant and under r light conditions in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . in _PROTEIN_ a reduction in cab levels can be observed only under fr light.chs gene _PROTEIN_ is dependent on a functional _PROTEIN_ signaling pathway under r and fr light conditions and accordingly it is reduced under r and fr light conditions in _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ which is involved in cell elongation as it encodes a xyloglucan endotransglucosylase related protein is negatively regulated by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in fr and r light respectively . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in mutant was reduced in r light similar to wt but less reduced in fr light . these data confirm the specificity of _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ specific pathways . note that the effects on fr dependent gene regulation of cab and _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ are not strong after h but very pronounced after h. all myb transcription _PROTEIN_ contain one to three conserved myb domains at the n terminus where the dna binding domain resides . the c terminus on the other hand shows a high degree of variability among the various myb proteins and is suggested to be important for protein protein interaction . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ is a transcriptional activator and to identify the region of this protein responsible for this function we fused the full length _PROTEIN_ cdna and _PROTEIN_ mutants to sequences encoding the dna binding domain . these dna fusion constructs were tested in yeast for their ability to promote _PROTEIN_ of the lacz and genes by binding to upstream activation regions . this allows assessment of growth on medium without histidine and measurement of galactosidase activity . figure shows that the full length _PROTEIN_ protein has low levels of transcriptional activity but the c terminal fragment _PROTEIN_ showed high levels of activation as measured by growth without histidine and in presence of mm _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ n terminal fragment _PROTEIN_ and a c terminal fragment _PROTEIN_ alone were unable to transactivate the reporter gene and prevented growth in the absence of histidine . however _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ promoted better growth without histidine than the full length _PROTEIN_ . only ctc however could promote growth in the presence of mm _PROTEIN_ which increased the stringency of the experiment . these results were confirmed by galactosidase assays . these data show that the c terminal domain of _PROTEIN_ contains sequences with transactivation function . furthermore the results suggest the existence of two possibly distinct transactivation regions one between amino acid residues and and the other which shows six times higher galactosidase activity between amino acid residue and the c terminus . as the full length _PROTEIN_ fusion shows less activity than the c terminal fragment alone the results suggest a negative regulatory function associated with the n terminal part of the protein which contains the dna binding domain . the predicted _PROTEIN_ protein contains three potential monopartite _LOCATION_ localization signals . the presence of these signals and the _PROTEIN_ that _PROTEIN_ is a myb type protein with transcriptional activity suggest that _PROTEIN_ might function in the _LOCATION_ . we used a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein to assay for the subcellular localization of the protein . a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct was transfected into onion epidermis cells by particle bombardment and the treated onion peels were incubated in the dark or in w light . in contrast with the cytoplasmic/nuclear distribution of the _METHOD_ protein which was used as a control we found that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein is localized in the _LOCATION_ irrespective of the light conditions . moreover we observed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localizes to subnuclear foci which are distributed throughout the _LOCATION_ . this formation of speckles is time dependent . four to six hours after bombardment of the onion cells with the full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ staining was evenly distributed throughout the _LOCATION_ . _LOCATION_ speckle formation was observed only after h . at this time point in of the _LOCATION_ examined the _METHOD_ signal was detected exclusively in these foci with no significant background signal elsewhere in the _LOCATION_ . four to eight h _PROTEIN_ usually no _METHOD_ staining was visible . these results suggest that the formation of speckles might precede degradation of the protein . to test the functions of the putative nls and the signals that direct the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein to _LOCATION_ speckles we made deletion constructs of _PROTEIN_ and fused them to the _METHOD_ coding sequence . an n terminal fragment of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ containing only the domain was sufficient to direct _LOCATION_ localization but the fusion protein did not accumulate in _LOCATION_ speckles . the same result was obtained for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . only the deletion construct _PROTEIN_ again was able to localize to _LOCATION_ speckles . the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ was no longer able to localize to the _LOCATION_ and its distribution throughout the cell resembled the localization of the _METHOD_ protein alone . the most conserved putative _LOCATION_ localization signal occurs between amino acids and . however an n terminal deletion of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ still was able to localize to the _LOCATION_ and to speckles . furthermore this putative nls _LOCATION_ alone could not direct _METHOD_ to the _LOCATION_ efficiently . therefore _LOCATION_ localization signals other than the one between amino acids are needed to direct _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ and these are located between amino acids within the myb domain . results from our deletion experiments suggest that sequences between amino acids and are responsible for localization to _LOCATION_ speckles . nonetheless certain sequences at the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ are in addition necessary for subnuclear localization as fusion of an nls from _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ caused accumulation in the _LOCATION_ but not in speckles . studies in mammalian cells have identified several proteins that localize to _LOCATION_ speckles . in a few cases for example pml it has been shown that these proteins accumulate in speckles only when they are conjugated with a ubiquitin like protein called sumo . sumo has been implicated in directing proteins to specific _LOCATION_ structures and stabilizing them rather than being involved in protein degradation as is ubiquitin . we observed a consensus motif for sumoylation at amino acid residues without the hydrophobic amino acid preceding the target lysine . a glycine residue which is usually in the vicinity of a sumoylation signal can be found five amino acids upstream of this site . as sumo usually is conjugated to a lysine residue we mutated to an arginine in the context of the full length _PROTEIN_ protein fused to _METHOD_ . the _PROTEIN_ mutant localized to the _LOCATION_ but not to speckles suggesting that sumoylation plays a role in the localization of _PROTEIN_ to _LOCATION_ speckles .
