chloroplast biogenesis is a complex process in higher plants . screening chloroplast biogenesis mutants and elucidating their molecular _METHOD_ will provide insight into the process of chloroplast biogenesis . in this paper we obtained an early chloroplast biogenesis mutant _PROTEIN_ that displayed albino cotyledons and was seedling lethal . microscopy observations revealed that the chloroplast of _PROTEIN_ mutants lacked an organized _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the _PROTEIN_ gene which is highly _PROTEIN_ in cotyledons and seedlings encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein _PROTEIN_ with a c terminal dyw domain . the _PROTEIN_ protein is localized in the chloroplast and contains a conserved hxexncxxc motif that is similar to the activated site of cytidine deaminase . the _PROTEIN_ mutation affects the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _LOCATION_ encoded genes . immunoblot analyses showed that the levels of photosynthetic proteins _PROTEIN_ substantially in _PROTEIN_ mutants . inspection of all reported _LOCATION_ rna editing sites revealed that one editing site _PROTEIN_ is not edited in _PROTEIN_ mutants . therefore the _PROTEIN_ protein must regulate the rna editing of this site and the dysfunctional _PROTEIN_ protein from the unedited rna molecules could lead to the mutated phenotype . all of these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is required for chloroplast transcript _PROTEIN_ rna editing and early chloroplast biogenesis in arabidopsis thaliana .
to identify candidate genes essential for early chloroplast biogenesis we obtained the knock out transgenic lines for genes the products of which are chloroplast targeted and are highly _PROTEIN_ in early stage seedlings . one t dna insertion line of the gene _PROTEIN_ designated _PROTEIN_ displayed a low accumulation of photosynthetic pigments and thus it was further investigated in detail . the _PROTEIN_ mutant showed an albino cotyledon without a primary leaf and only survived for roughly week when grown in a plant nutrient solution medium . therefore it was unable to grow photoautotrophically and was seedling lethal under autotrophic growth conditions . when supplemented with sucrose as a _PROTEIN_ source the _PROTEIN_ mutant was able to produce only two albino primary leaves before it stopped growing . neither viability nor pigmentation of this mutant was restored under low light growing conditions . thus this phenotype is not caused by photo oxidative stress . we quantified the levels of chlorophyll a and b in both the mutant and the wild type . the total chlorophyll content of _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ was lower than that of the wild type . the photosynthetic activity of _PROTEIN_ mutants was also investigated . we analyzed the fv/fm /fm value which is an indicator of photo inhibition _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the fv/fm of the day old wild type was determined to be but the value could not be calculated in _PROTEIN_ mutants . the results indicated that photosynthetic activity was seriously damaged in _PROTEIN_ mutants . as the _PROTEIN_ mutant showed an albino phenotype we compared its chloroplast morphology and ultrastructure with that of the wild type by transmission electron microscopy . in the mature chloroplasts of the day old wild type an organized _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was observed . the stroma _LOCATION_ and grana _LOCATION_ were distinguished in chloroplasts of the wild type . additionally the chloroplast contained starch grains . conversely chloroplasts in _PROTEIN_ leaves were smaller than those in the wild type and no organized _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were observed except for a few short appressed internal _LOCATION_ . moreover the _LOCATION_ observed in _PROTEIN_ mutants did not contain starch grains . these features indicate that the organelle was arrested at an early stage of chloroplast biogenesis . our genetic analysis showed that the albino phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutants was controlled by a recessive _LOCATION_ gene and co segregated with the kanamycin resistance marker . the sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction fragments showed that the t dna was inserted downstream of the base pair from the start codon of the gene _PROTEIN_ . reverse transcriptase pcr results indicated that the transcript of the gene was absent in _PROTEIN_ mutants but present in the wild type . all of these results showed that _PROTEIN_ was a candidate gene for _PROTEIN_ . to further confirm that the _PROTEIN_ gene was _PROTEIN_ we performed a complement test with a genomic sequence . a bp wild type genomic sequence containing the _PROTEIN_ gene as well as its bp upstream and bp downstream sequences was introduced into the normal phenotype offspring from _PROTEIN_ heterozygotes via an agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation . then transgenic plants were screened out . among them five plants that were _PROTEIN_ heterozygotes were obtained . the segregate rates of their offspring were far from . furthermore we determined the genotype of these offspring as described in the experimental procedures and obtained more than _PROTEIN_ homozygous plants from the sixth transgenic lines that carried the fragments of the exogenous genomic sequence . these plants displayed green cotyledons and leaves after their germination . rt pcr analysis also showed that the transcripts of _PROTEIN_ were present in these plants . furthermore tem observations for these plants showed that the chloroplasts had similar ultrastructure to the wild type plants . these results indicate that the bp genomic fragments can successfully complement the mutated phenotype and that the _PROTEIN_ gene was _PROTEIN_ . blast searches of the complete arabidopsis genomic sequence revealed that only one copy of the _PROTEIN_ gene was present in the _LOCATION_ genome . to obtain the full length _PROTEIN_ cdna sequence we exploited the rapid amplification of cdna ends _PROTEIN_ which resulted in the identification of the complete cdna sequence . sequence analysis indicated that the gene is not interrupted by introns and it contains a bp untranslated region a bp utr and the entire coding sequence consistent with that in the arabidopsis information resource database . the _PROTEIN_ gene encodes a putative polypeptide of amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of kda . the protein is a member of the _PROTEIN_ family and contains eleven characteristic _PROTEIN_ motifs which can predictably form into a pair of antiparallel helices . besides these _PROTEIN_ motifs this protein contains three extra conserved motifs e e and dyw in the c terminal . thus _PROTEIN_ belongs to the dyw group of the _PROTEIN_ subfamily as proposed by citation . moreover _PROTEIN_ contains an unknown motif consisting of amino acids which is highly conserved in some _PROTEIN_ proteins including _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . importantly this protein contains another conserved motif hxexncxxc that is similar to the activated site of cytidine deaminases . this motif was also observed in the other four dyw proteins . the _PROTEIN_ homologous proteins are conserved in grape rice and maize and were very similar to the vitis vinifera protein _PROTEIN_ the zea maize protein and the oryza sativa protein . the targetp and predotar _METHOD_ predicted that the _PROTEIN_ protein is targeted to the chloroplast and that its amino acid n terminal region is likely to be a transit peptide . to confirm its subcellular localization an _PROTEIN_ n terminal transit peptide fused with _METHOD_ driven by the camv promoter was introduced into the wild type plants . stable transgenic plants were then examined with confocal laser microscopy and the _METHOD_ fusion protein with the _PROTEIN_ n terminal transit peptides was co localized with chloroplast _METHOD_ . with just the control vector _METHOD_ _METHOD_ accumulated in the cytoplasm whereas no signals were found in the wild type . therefore it appears that the amino acid sequence of the _PROTEIN_ n terminal region functions as a transit peptide and _PROTEIN_ is localized in the chloroplast . _PROTEIN_ data from genvestigator showed that _PROTEIN_ was widely _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis but the highest _PROTEIN_ level was observed in seedlings . rt pcr analysis revealed that the _PROTEIN_ abundance of the _PROTEIN_ gene was highest in day old seedlings compared with that in other tissues . a quantitative real time rt pcr analysis confirmed this _PROTEIN_ pattern of the gene which is in accordance with that in the microarray data . the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis was further investigated using a _PROTEIN_ reporter gene fused to its promoter construct . according to the observed pattern _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ very early in germinating seeds . in day old seedlings gus staining was primarily detected in the emerging cotyledons as well as in the hypocotyls with faint staining in the root . in day old seedlings gus activity was detected in most of the plant and was particularly strong in cotyledons . gus staining was also observed in the stem and silique but not in the matured seeds . within the flower gus staining was intense in the sepals the stamens and styles but not in the _PROTEIN_ . gus staining for transgenic lines showed that _PROTEIN_ was widely _PROTEIN_ throughout the plant and that higher _PROTEIN_ levels were found in the cotyledon and in the seedling . altogether these findings show that _PROTEIN_ was highly _PROTEIN_ in cotyledons and seedlings which was in agreement with its putative roles in chloroplast biogenesis . inspection of the dyw domain sequences from various plants and early diverging bryophytes indicated that the domain was highly correlated with rna editing . more recently genetic evidence indicating that the dyw subgroup and rna editing events are correlated have emerged . therefore we systematically checked the editing sites that have been published in _PROTEIN_ mutants by the direct sequencing of the rt pcr products containing these sites . of these published rna editing sites sites were edited correctly in _PROTEIN_ mutants to be the same as those in the wild type grown under the same growth conditions . one editing site event _PROTEIN_ did not occur as shown in figure . to confirm the results the pcr fragment containing the editing site from the wild type or _PROTEIN_ cdna was subjected to digestion of the restricted enzyme ecori . the results showed that most of the rna molecules were edited whereas the edited molecules were hardly detected in _PROTEIN_ mutants . we also evaluated the editing rates of the _PROTEIN_ site in the wild type complementary lines and _PROTEIN_ mutants . our results showed that the rates in the wild type and in the complementary lines were and respectively under our culture conditions . in contrast no molecules were edited in _PROTEIN_ mutants which suggested that the editing event was abolished in the mutant . editing of codon in wild type _PROTEIN_ transcripts encoding the subunit of _PROTEIN_ the component of acetyl coa _PROTEIN_ resulted in a residue change that was not detected in the mutant . the site was edited in the wild type and the complemented plant under the same conditions . therefore we concluded that _PROTEIN_ regulated the rna editing of the site . alignment analysis for the protein among the various species showed that leucine or similar amino acids were also conserved at the same position in the _METHOD_ . thus the non editing of the site in _PROTEIN_ mutants might affect the functions of the protein . the _PROTEIN_ of chloroplast encoded genes is tightly linked with chloroplast developmental status and their _PROTEIN_ is carried out by two rna polymerases of different origins _LOCATION_ encoded polymerase _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ encoded polymerase . to investigate the effects of _PROTEIN_ mutation on these transcription processes we compared the transcript profiles of various chloroplast encoded genes between day old wild type plants and _PROTEIN_ mutants . the five genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were selected as _PROTEIN_ dependent genes . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were chosen as nep dependent genes . the four genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were selected as both _PROTEIN_ and nep dependent genes . our results showed that the transcripts of class i genes displayed of the levels of mrna produced by the wild type transcripts . in contrast the _PROTEIN_ levels of class iii genes were higher in the mutant than in the wild type . among the class ii genes the _PROTEIN_ levels of the two genes and were about and respectively whereas the transcripts of the remaining two genes were about two and four times as high as those in the wild type . these results indicate that the _PROTEIN_ of the _LOCATION_ genes in arabidopsis is affected by the _PROTEIN_ mutation . as the mutation affects chloroplast ultrastructure we examined the accumulation of photosynthetic proteins in the mutant . the levels of the following photosynthetic proteins were examined by immunoblot assay in both the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ mutants the large subunit of soluble rubisco proteins _PROTEIN_ photosystem i subunits psad and _PROTEIN_ photosystem ii subunits _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the subunit _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ subunit . the photosynthetic proteins including psad _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were not detected in _PROTEIN_ mutants . the level of the _PROTEIN_ subunit was reduced in _PROTEIN_ mutants compared with that of the wild type . meanwhile the level of _PROTEIN_ an extrinsic protein was similar to that of the wild type . this indicated that the accumulation of most photosynthetic proteins was affected in _PROTEIN_ mutants which is probably the consequence of defective chloroplast biogenesis .
