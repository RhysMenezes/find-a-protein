apical actin filaments are crucial for pollen tube tip growth . however the specific dynamic changes and regulatory _METHOD_ associated with actin filaments in the apical region remain largely unknown . here we have investigated the quantitative dynamic parameters that underlie actin filament growth and disappearance in the apical regions of pollen tubes and identified villin as the major player that drives rapid turnover of actin filaments in this region . downregulation of arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ led to accumulation of actin filaments at the pollen tube apex . careful analysis of single filament dynamics showed that the severing frequency significantly _PROTEIN_ and the lifetime significantly increased in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes . these results indicate that villin mediated severing is critical for turnover and departure of actin filaments originating in the apical region . consequently the construction of actin collars was affected in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes . in addition to the _PROTEIN_ in severing frequency actin filaments also became wavy and buckled in the apical cytoplasm of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes . these results suggest that villin confers rigidity upon actin filaments . furthermore an observed _PROTEIN_ in skewness of actin filaments in the subapical region of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes suggests that villin mediated bundling activity may also play a role in the construction of actin collars . thus our data suggest that villins promote actin turnover at pollen tube tips and facilitate the construction of actin collars .
based on the biochemical nature of _PROTEIN_ we proposed that it may act in concert with the tip focused calcium gradient to regulate actin dynamics in pollen tubes . however loss of _PROTEIN_ does not affect the overall actin organization in pollen tubes . therefore we hypothesized that _PROTEIN_ which is _PROTEIN_ in pollen acts in a redundant manner with _PROTEIN_ to regulate actin dynamics in the pollen tube . to test this hypothesis we generated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants by crossing _PROTEIN_ with either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . results from this analysis revealed that loss of _PROTEIN_ alone had no overt effects on pollen tube growth but that loss of _PROTEIN_ enhanced the effects of loss of _PROTEIN_ . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ acts redundantly with _PROTEIN_ to regulate pollen tube elongation . compared with the wild type _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes became curled and wider at some regions along the tube . the width of pollen tubes increased significantly in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes . thus these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ acts synergistically with _PROTEIN_ to regulate _PROTEIN_ pollen tube growth . to determine the role of villin in the regulation of actin dynamics in the apical region it is important to first determine where it is localized in the pollen tube . constructs containing the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ coding sequence fused with genomic _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ rescue the growth phenotype of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes indicating that these _METHOD_ fusion proteins are functional and suggesting that they faithfully represent the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . as shown in figure both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ decorated filamentous structures in the shanks of pollen tubes but the signal associated with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was more prominent consistent with the _PROTEIN_ that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ at much higher levels than _PROTEIN_ in pollen . however both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were present in the apical and subapical regions of pollen tubes where they formed filamentous structures . thus these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ decorate filamentous structures found throughout the pollen tube including the apical and subapical regions . to visualize the dynamics of actin filaments within the apical dome it is important to have a live cell probe capable of labeling actin filaments in this region . lifeact _METHOD_ represents an ideal actin probe that labels actin filaments in tip growing cells . lifeact _METHOD_ labeled actin filaments in arabidopsis thaliana pollen tubes revealing a typical distribution pattern . therefore using this methodology it is possible to visualize the dynamics of actin filaments and determine the parameters associated with filament growth and disappearance within the apical dome in arabidopsis pollen tubes . visualization of z series optical sections revealed that actin filaments are present within the apical dome . to determine the site of origination of these filaments we visualized time lapse z series projection images of actin filaments which revealed that most of the actin filaments grew out from the apical _LOCATION_ . these filaments are most likely nucleated by _LOCATION_ anchored formins . to further characterize the details associated with actin filament dynamics we observed actin filaments at the cortex and the central portion of the pollen tube within the apical dome . real time visualization of actin filaments in the medial optical section clearly demonstrated that actin filaments originate and grow out from the _LOCATION_ at the extreme apex some of which shift from the apex to the apical flank . the newly generated actin filaments are highly dynamic exhibiting rapid growth and shrinkage and frequent severing . the dynamic traits associated with actin filaments may explain why they are less abundant at the apex . supplemental figure online shows a schematic diagram of actin filament growth and disappearance within the apical dome proposing a model in which actin filaments are generated constantly from the _LOCATION_ and turned over rapidly . the extreme tip which contains fewer actin filaments always faces toward the direction of growth suggesting that the state of actin filaments at the extreme tip may be involved in the control of growth direction . to explore whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cooperate with the tip focused calcium gradient to regulate actin dynamics we analyzed actin filament dynamics within the apical dome of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes . similar to wild type pollen tubes actin filaments were detected in the apical region of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen tube . direct visualization of actin filament dynamics in both the middle and cortical regions of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes revealed that actin filaments originate from the apical _LOCATION_ . however unlike wild type pollen tubes actin filaments accumulated in the tips of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes . kymographs of actin filaments in pollen tube tips showed that actin filaments accumulated at both the apex and the apical flank . these results suggest that actin nucleation at the _LOCATION_ of the apex is reasonably active . however in contrast with wild type pollen tubes the loss of the _LOCATION_ anchored actin filaments via severing was rarely observed . in _PROTEIN_ after substantial accumulation of actin filaments at the apex of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen tube the intertwined filaments were instead observed to depart from the _LOCATION_ as a unit . a schematic diagram describing actin filament growth and dynamics within the apical dome of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen tube is shown in figure . the diagram shows that long intertwined _LOCATION_ originated and anchored actin filaments remain intact within the apical dome of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen tube and that they depart from the _LOCATION_ via an unknown mechanism . to characterize the defect in actin dynamics within the apical dome of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes on a single filament level we quantified the dynamic parameters associated with single actin filaments within the apical domes of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes and compared these parameters with those of filaments in wild type pollen tubes . as shown in figure actin filament growth can easily be tracked and severing events can be detected in wild type pollen tubes . by contrast actin filament severing events were rarely detected in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes . in comparison to filaments in wild type pollen tubes the lifetimes of actin filaments significantly increased and the filament severing frequency significantly _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes suggesting that loss of villin mediated severing activity at least partially accounts for the accumulation of actin filaments in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes . additionally the average severing frequency _PROTEIN_ significantly in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutants suggesting that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are required for severing actin filaments in the pollen tube . in wild type pollen tubes the elongation rate of actin filaments can reach consistent with the presence of a high concentration of actin/profilin complexes in pollen . by contrast the actin elongation rate was _PROTEIN_ significantly in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes likely due to the efficient conversion of monomeric actin into filamentous actin to consequently _PROTEIN_ the concentration of the actin/profilin pool locally and/or to upregulate the activity of another capping _PROTEIN_ such as at cp . thus these data suggest that the severing activity of villin promotes the rapid turnover of actin filaments in the apical regions of pollen tubes . apical _LOCATION_ nucleated actin filaments have previously been demonstrated to be required for the construction of subapical actin collars . thus we hypothesized that the accumulation of actin filaments within the apical region of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes might affect the formation of actin collars at the subapex . actin filaments typically formed bright highly bundled structures in the subapical regions of wild type pollen tubes . the organization of actin filaments in these structures was quite regular consistent with previous findings . by contrast the _METHOD_ associated with actin filament staining in the corresponding region of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes was quite dim and the distribution of actin filaments was relatively irregular . the significant _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ pixel intensity associated with f actin staining in the boxed regions of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes suggests that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are required for stabilizing actin filaments at the subapex . additionally the _PROTEIN_ in skewness at the subapex in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes suggests that the bundling activity of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may be involved in the construction of actin collars . we also found that compared with that in the wild type the width of actin cables _PROTEIN_ and the angles formed between actin filaments and the pollen tube growth axis increased in the shank of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are also required for bundling actin filaments as well as _PROTEIN_ the longitudinal arrangement of actin cables in the shank region . the distribution of actin filaments in the subapex region of pollen tubes was assessed by measuring the value of eccentricity. this measure has previously been successfully used to assess the uniformity of cellulose microfibers and the organization of actin filaments . by analyzing the elliptical shape of the fast fourier transform _PROTEIN_ of actin filament images we calculated eccentricity values . a larger eccentricity value indicates that the orientation of the actin filaments is more ordered . the eccentricity value was significantly lower in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes compared with wild type pollen tubes . this observation indicates that the distribution of actin filaments is more random in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are required for the construction of actin collars . we next performed live imaging of actin filaments to visualize the dynamic parameters underlying the defect in the construction of actin collars . consistent with previous findings most actin filaments present at the subapex traveled from the apical _LOCATION_ . in wild type pollen tubes linear actin filaments dissociated from the apical _LOCATION_ via severing . by contrast actin filaments became wavy and buckled in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes . to quantify the wavy structure of these actin filaments we assessed the convolutedness defined by citation as the ratio of traced actin filament length divided by the longest length of a bounding rectangle . we found that the convolutedness and the rate of change of convolutedness of actin filaments was significantly increased in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes compared with wild type tubes . these observations suggest that the rigidity of actin filaments was _PROTEIN_ resulting in buckling . we also noticed that at the subapex of wild type pollen tubes actin filaments forming wide angles with the growth axis of the pollen tube were frequently severed . this finding suggests that severing activity may facilitate the construction of actin collars by eliminating improperly placed actin filaments . by contrast in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes the percentage of actin filaments forming wide angles with the growth axis that underwent severing was substantially _PROTEIN_ . thus these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ regulate the construction of actin collars by increasing rigidity of actin filaments bundling actin filaments and severing actin filaments . subapical actin structures have been suggested to play an important role in organizing the vesicles in an inverted cone shaped area found in the apical region of the pollen tube . we therefore wondered whether the distribution of vesicles at the subapex was altered in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes . _PROTEIN_ is a rab _PROTEIN_ that specifically decorates vesicles found in this inverted area of the apical region of pollen tubes and arabidopsis root hairs . consistent with previous findings _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ accumulated at the apical region of wild type pollen tubes forming a concentrated inverted v shape . however _PROTEIN_ labeled vesicles at the subapex in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes were more uniformly distributed and dimmer . real time visualization of _PROTEIN_ labeled vesicles showed that despite the _PROTEIN_ that they are transported rapidly the concentrated inverted v shape of the vesicle pool is _PROTEIN_ in the wild type pollen tube subapex . by contrast the distribution of _PROTEIN_ positive vesicles was less focused in the subapex of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes . to quantify the distribution of _PROTEIN_ labeled vesicles in the pollen tube we calculated the ratio of the _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ labeled vesicles within the apical and subapical regions to the _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ labeled vesicles at the shanks of pollen tubes . this ratio was significantly _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes . these data indicate that the vesicle distribution was altered in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes compared with wild type pollen tubes which may partially explain the _PROTEIN_ rate of pollen tube growth in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants .
to examine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in pollen tubes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genomic dnas were amplified using primer pairs and respectively . the amplified fragments were subsequently cloned into the entry vector through a gateway _PROTEIN_ reaction according to the manufacturer s instructions . after verification of the sequence of the amplified fragments by dna sequencing the sequences were transferred into the destination vector in which the promoter had been deleted via the gateway lr reaction according to the manufacturer s instructions . this procedure resulted in the generation of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs in which _METHOD_ was fused to the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ respectively . these plasmids were then transformed into agrobacterium tumefaciens strain and introduced into _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants by the floral dip method . freshly opened flowers derived from the wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were collected to isolate total rna using _PROTEIN_ reagent as described in the manufacturer s instructions . to synthesize cdna the isolated total rna was

resulting data were processed using r programming language . to quantify actin structures in the subapical region a region located from the pollen tube tip was selected . to quantify f actin levels

region was performed using imagej with the fit ellipse plugin as previously described . maximally projected images were initially transformed into _PROTEIN_ images . the _PROTEIN_ images were then thresholded at different values and followed by shape analysis by fitting an ellipse to the fourier spectra in fit ellipse in order to calculate the eccentricity . the threshold value was initially set to and the value was increased by one at each step until black pixels remained . a series of values was generated for each image and the last to values were selected and averaged to yield the eccentricity value . more than nine pollen tubes were analyzed for each line and three independent experiments were performed . the extent of actin filament bundling in the selected region was determined by measuring the value of skewness according to published methods . the z stack optical sections from the area of interest in the subapical region were processed by background subtraction with the rolling ball radius set to pixels and the gaussian blur radius set to . a minimum of pollen tubes from each genotype was selected to determine the average skewness of the actin filaments . quantification of the angles formed between actin cables and the pollen tube growth axis as well as the width of actin cables in the shank of pollen tubes was according to the method described by citation . the distribution of transport vesicles in pollen tubes was analyzed in plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . after the average length reached the pollen tubes were observed under an olympus multiphoton laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with a objective . samples were excited under a nm argon laser and the emission wavelength range was set to to nm . to trace the dynamics of
