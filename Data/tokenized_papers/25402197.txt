from individual localization and proteomic studies we know that _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ harbor part of the machinery performing the photosynthetic reactions . the minor components of the stroma _LOCATION_ proteome regulating and _PROTEIN_ the photosynthetic machinery are in the process of being unraveled . in this study we developed and proteolytic digestion methods and used them to identify minor _LOCATION_ proteins e.g . transporters in stroma _LOCATION_ prepared from arabidopsis thaliana heynh leaves . digestion with chymotrypsin yielded the largest number of peptides but in combination with methanol extraction resulted in identification of the largest number of _LOCATION_ proteins . although less efficient in extracting peptides digestion with trypsin and chymotrypsin led to identification of additional proteins . we identified a total of proteins including _LOCATION_ proteins . almost half are known _LOCATION_ proteins with roles in photosynthetic light reactions proteolysis and import . the other half including many transporters are not known as chloroplast proteins because they have been either curated to other cellular compartments or not curated at all at the _LOCATION_ protein databases . transporters include _PROTEIN_ cassette proteins transporters for k and other cations . other proteins either have a role in processes probably linked to photosynthesis namely translation metabolism stress and signaling or are contaminants . our results indicate that all these proteins are present in stroma _LOCATION_ however individual studies are required to validate their location and putative roles . this study also provides strategies complementary to traditional methods for identification of _LOCATION_ proteins from other cellular compartments .
to prepare stroma _LOCATION_ we first isolated _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ from arabidopsis leaves purified them on sucrose gradient and then solubilized them with digitonin followed by centrifugation . the chl a/b ratios differed considerably between the resulting grana and stroma _LOCATION_ fractions consistent with a different composition for the complex in these regions . the electrophoretic pattern of stroma _LOCATION_ was clearly distinct from that of the grana with previous reports . the purity of stroma _LOCATION_ preparations was evaluated in parallel with that of _LOCATION_ and grana by western blotting using antibodies against markers from various subcellular compartments . the _PROTEIN_ subunit of the _PROTEIN_ synthase and the _PROTEIN_ subunit of psi both markers for the stroma _LOCATION_ were found highly enriched in this type of preparation . and _PROTEIN_ subunits of psii which are markers for the grana were found only in low amounts in the stroma regions . the envelope marker protein _PROTEIN_ was not detected in any of the _LOCATION_ subfractions . in addition the previously characterized _PROTEIN_ and the _LOCATION_ phosphate transporter were detected in _LOCATION_ and stroma _LOCATION_ fraction but not in the grana fraction and envelope . while western blotting detected some mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase _PROTEIN_ the preparations were essentially free of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ h and tonoplast _PROTEIN_ . thus pure stroma _LOCATION_ have been prepared and were used as the starting material for enrichment of hydrophobic proteins and lc _METHOD_ analysis . the extrinsic subunits of the _PROTEIN_ synthase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ represent a large proportion of the stroma _LOCATION_ proteome making the analysis of minor proteins from this _LOCATION_ region _PROTEIN_ . to remove these subunits as well as other extrinsic proteins and loops we shaved the stroma _LOCATION_ with _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ show that indeed the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ subunits were largely absent from the shaved stroma _LOCATION_ . we further washed these _LOCATION_ with and then digested them with ctr . following centrifugation the proteins in the supernatant were analyzed as such whereas the proteins in the pelleted _LOCATION_ were further extracted with methanol in combination with ctr . alternatively they were extracted with _PROTEIN_ heat in polyacrylamide gels and then digested with either _PROTEIN_ or ctr without electrophoretic separation _PROTEIN_ . among the four fractions m/ctr contained mostly peptides extracted from _LOCATION_ proteins . when comparing the ability of the four methods to extract peptides for protein identification we have found that ctr gave the largest number of peptides of them being unique for this method and with the highest protein coverage . the m/ctr method also allowed for extraction of a large number of peptides but from a much larger number of proteins than ctr . the procedures resulted in extraction of a much lower number of peptides than the methods . this was unexpected as we assumed that _PROTEIN_ is more efficient than methanol to extract hydrophobic proteins and since a previous study reporting of the solubilized proteins ensured good digestion . the mean _PROTEIN_ score of all peptides extracted by the m/ctr method was > and also higher than for the peptides extracted by ctr alone indicating a more hydrophobic proteome in agreement with the observations from fig . . the methods extracted relatively more hydrophilic peptides . the mean _PROTEIN_ score of peptides identified by all methods was slightly higher than that of the _LOCATION_ integral _LOCATION_ proteome curated at _PROTEIN_ . this indicates that the developed methods have succeeded in extracting hydrophobic peptides from the stroma _LOCATION_ . because the four methods are complementary independent strategies for identification of proteins the derived data sets were merged to ensure a significant coverage of the stroma _LOCATION_ proteome . altogether proteins were identified by matching peptides more specifically proteins based on peptides proteins based on peptides and proteins based on single unique peptides . of the proteins are described as _LOCATION_ proteins at uniprot . many _LOCATION_ proteins did not have tmds but were found associated with the _LOCATION_ through various types of interactions . therefore the identified proteins were analyzed for tmds using tmhmm considered to be the most accurate software for transmembrane segment detection . among the _LOCATION_ proteins were putative integral _LOCATION_ proteins with up to tmds . the m/ctr method extracted peptides from out of the integral _LOCATION_ proteins . to confirm whether tmd peptides were extracted by any of the four methods we have screened the identified photosynthetic subunits . they were all found to be integral _LOCATION_ proteins . we found tmd peptides extracted from of them and in addition six extracted from transporters . most tmd peptides were extracted by the methods and only a few by the methods . only three of the tmd peptides from photosynthetic subunits and none from transport proteins were recognized at _PROTEIN_ . these results show the ability of the methods applied to extract highly hydrophobic peptides from the stroma _LOCATION_ . thirteen out of the identified proteins were chloroplast encoded and the remaining were _LOCATION_ encoded . the latter ones were analyzed for the presence of a putative ctp using targetp and in addition using chlorop and wolf psort _METHOD_ . the prediction results presented in fig . are based on the data for each identified protein from table . from this analysis proteins were assigned a chloroplast location by all three _METHOD_ and including photosynthetic subunits four other known chloroplast proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and one unknown protein . a further seven proteins carry a ctp predicted by either chlorop and/or wolf psort _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . taken together _LOCATION_ proteins were predicted to be chloroplastic representing approximately of the identified proteins . the remaining proteins did not harbor a ctp predictable by the used _METHOD_ . we have also examined the curated location at _PROTEIN_ which is based on protein lists from the van wijk laboratory and published proteomic studies . proteins identified in our stroma _LOCATION_ preparations have previously been found either in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or in the stroma . when comparing our list of identified proteins with those recently reported by tomizioli et al . out of proteins were found in common namely photosynthetic subunits and also two other known chloroplast proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . there are also proteins that have no curated location at _PROTEIN_ and were not found by tomizioli et al . and seven proteins with curated location other than the chloroplast . these may represent either dually targeted proteins or are possible contaminants . when comparing the four methods used for extraction of peptides an equal number of proteins were identified based on the ctr and m/ctr methods but m/ctr yielded many more proteins with no curated location at _PROTEIN_ . the methods resulted in identification of similar number of known chloroplast proteins and also proteins with no curated location . the identified proteins were classified based on the mapman annotation and then grouped into eight categories . the proteins with known function or having homology to known proteins comprised . most of them fell into the class of photosynthetic proteins followed by transporters . the remaining proteins had putative roles in translation metabolism protein fate stress response and signaling . six percent were probable contaminants based on function . below we discuss the members of each category and comment on the current knowledge about their biological function and location . proteins within this category can be clustered according to the type of _LOCATION_ photosynthetic complex . we identified five psii proteins corresponding to the subunits of the core complex _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and two members of the lhcii family _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . for psi we identified proteins corresponding to the core including some paralogues _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and one member of the lhci family _PROTEIN_ . for the _PROTEIN_ synthase and cyt complexes three and four subunits each were identified respectively _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . all identified photosynthetic subunits were _LOCATION_ proteins eight of them being highly hydrophobic with > tmds . they were either or _LOCATION_ harboring predictable ctp and all have previously been identified in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and its stroma subfraction . in the stroma _LOCATION_ regions psi and cyt perform photosynthetic linear and cyclic electron transport coupled to h transport whereas the _PROTEIN_ synthase catalyzes the synthesis of _PROTEIN_ . although not active psii is also present in the stroma _LOCATION_ where it is formed and repaired following inactivation . this could explain the presence of those five psii core subunits in our preparations . transport proteins are the second most represented category in the analyzed preparations of stroma _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . with the exception of the identified transporters were not predicted to be chloroplastic . this indicates that they have unusual transit sequences and can not easily be predicted using common _METHOD_ or that are probable contaminants . with the exception of _PROTEIN_ found in the _LOCATION_ the other identified transporters lacked a curated location at _PROTEIN_ although two have been previously localized . fig . shows the subclassification of the identified transporters according to the mapman annotation . _PROTEIN_ cassette proteins constitute a superfamily of over members in arabidopsis with diverse substrates and involved in a broad range of processes . the multidrug resistance _PROTEIN_ found in this study belongs to the b subfamily and has been reported to be involved in auxin transport . the multidrug protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ belonging to the c subfamily has been found in the _LOCATION_ and reported to transport folate and derivatives . the pleiotropic drug resistance _PROTEIN_ belongs to the g subfamily and has not been studied previously . its paralogues are involved in abiotic and biotic stress response by transporting secondary metabolites . the potassium ion is the most abundant cation in the plant cell and there are and k transport _METHOD_ belonging to five major types in arabidopsis . two putative k transport proteins were identified in this study namely from the low affinity pot/kup/kt family and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ from the family of high affinity channels . as mentioned above harbors a ctp and was previously found in the chloroplast phosphoproteome . among proteins annotated for metal ion transport natural macrophage protein _PROTEIN_ plays a role together with _PROTEIN_ in manganese ion export from the _LOCATION_ for optimal photosynthesis . the resistance protein _PROTEIN_ is a putative metal ion transporter suggested to play a role in auxin homeostasis . the putative sodium/hydrogen exchanger _PROTEIN_ belongs to the cation/proton _PROTEIN_ family proposed to play a role in monovalent cation homeostasis and ph regulation . _PROTEIN_ was localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and found to function as a li /h antiporter with a role in li detoxification and ion homeostasis in arabidopsis . cyclic channels _PROTEIN_ represent a family of plant nonselective cation channels _PROTEIN_ involved in the uptake of na and k . here we identified _PROTEIN_ which was not characterized previously . taken together our and previous published data indicate that at least three transporters namely _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are worth further experimental validation . the _PROTEIN_ that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have been previously localized to other cellular _LOCATION_ implies a possible contamination of our preparations with _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . however as western blots and also _METHOD_ _METHOD_ did not detect proteins from these compartments there is a possibility that at least some of the three transporters are targeted to more than one compartment . this possibility is supported by other examples of dually located transporters in the chloroplast and other compartments . interestingly the situation of dual targeting to stroma _LOCATION_ and other compartments has also been discussed for some transporters found by tomizioli et al . . in that report _PROTEIN_ and were found using digestion and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in _LOCATION_ and enriched in the stroma _LOCATION_ subfractions . however they have been _PROTEIN_ as envelope contaminants because of the presence of obvious envelope transporters in the analyzed preparations . we have not been able to extract peptides matching these two proteins with any of the four digestion methods indicating that they may have escaped our analyses during the shaving procedure . however we have immunodetected them with specific antibodies in our unshaved stroma _LOCATION_ preparations . interestingly in addition to proteins previously found in genetic studies namely the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the k /h exchanger _PROTEIN_ novel transporters were found by tomizioli et al . for which individual validation is required . this group includes three proteins with a role in protein fate . _PROTEIN_ is a known chloroplast protein involved in transport of proteins to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ is a metalloprotease with role in chloroplast biogenesis and repair of photosynthetic complexes . _PROTEIN_ is a probable ligase which mediates ubiquitination and subsequent proteosomal degradation of target proteins . _PROTEIN_ curated _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ based on its presence at mitodb . on the basis of its presence in the chloroplast phosphoproteome and in the envelope proteome it was suggested to play an important role in chloroplast protein quality control . interestingly other components of the system were found by tomizioli et al . but were considered contaminants . this group consists of four proteins . three of them namely and efgm have putative dead rna helicase activity which has not yet been studied . nevertheless paralogues of function inside the chloroplast in the biogenesis of the chloroplast ribosome . was previously found in the envelope proteome . the ligase is potentially involved in translation and was found dually targeted to the chloroplast and _LOCATION_ as many other synthetases . the putative disease resistance has not been previously studied . the protein _PROTEIN_ has been suggested to play a role during defense against bacterial attack by interacting with calmodulin and was found in the chloroplast phosphoproteome . only a small number of proteins involved in either primary or secondary metabolism were previously identified in the _LOCATION_ proteome . it was therefore proposed that the _LOCATION_ does not play a major role in such processes . in our preparations we found three proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with a metabolic role . the only known chloroplast protein among them was glutamate synthase which is involved in primary nitrogen assimilation . the arginine decarboxylase _PROTEIN_ is involved in the first step of polyamine biosynthesis namely conversion of arginine to putrescine under normal and stress conditions such as salinity and cold . putrescine and other polyamines have positive effects on photosynthetic reactions in chloroplast _LOCATION_ . phenylalanine _PROTEIN_ belongs to a family of four members catalyzing the first step of the phenylpropanoid pathway in the chloroplast . this pathway yields precursors to a variety of important secondary metabolites including flavonoids and also salicylic acid which are important during biotic and abiotic stress . two proteins involved in signaling were identified predicted by all three _METHOD_ to carry a ctp . receptor wakle is a putative _LOCATION_ ser/thr kinase . it was proposed as a gene based on its induction by wound stress and a salicylic acid derivative . its presence in our stroma _LOCATION_ preparations may be linked to the emerging role of chloroplasts in plant resistance to pathogens and insect herbivores . nudix hydrolase belongs to a family of proteins with members in arabidopsis . it has a putative function to hydrolyze nucleoside diphosphates linked to some moiety . nudix hydrolase homologues have a predicted distribution in the _LOCATION_ mitochondria and chloroplasts . although predicted location in the chloroplast requires validation another paralogue was recently localized to the chloroplast and characterized to control guanosine tetraphosphate levels in response to stress thus impacting gene _PROTEIN_ in chloroplasts . no abundant proteins from other cell compartments were found in our preparations of stroma _LOCATION_ . possible contaminants are among the proteins with neither ctp nor chloroplast curation at _PROTEIN_ . ten of them have putative functions unrelated to the chloroplast cell wall biosynthesis and degradation _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cell movement _PROTEIN_ mitosis dna damage _PROTEIN_ and the synthesis of ethylene lignin and anthocyanin _PROTEIN_ . besides this with the exception of _PROTEIN_ the identified peptides were either hydrophilic or weakly hydrophobic making them likely soluble contaminants of the analyzed _LOCATION_ proteome .
