plants control _PROTEIN_ uptake and water loss by modulating the aperture of stomata located in the epidermis . stomatal opening is initiated by the activation of h _PROTEIN_ in the guard cell _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in contrast to regulation of h _PROTEIN_ activity little is known about the translocation of the guard cell h _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . here we describe the isolation of an arabidopsis gene _PROTEIN_ that controls the translocation of a major h _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ encodes a protein with a mun domain known to mediate synaptic priming in neuronal exocytosis in animals . environmental stimuli change the localization of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ associated _PROTEIN_ to an intracellular compartment . _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ and stomatal opening require the association of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ . increased stomatal opening responses in plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ enhance the _PROTEIN_ assimilation rate promoting plant growth .
leaf temperature acts as a convenient indicator of transpiration and can help detect mutants with altered stomatal control . arabidopsis ht mutants were identified by higher leaf temperature than the wild type under low _PROTEIN_ conditions as visualized by infrared imaging . one of them a recessive mutant originally referred to as and here renamed _PROTEIN_ was impaired in _PROTEIN_ dependent leaf temperature change as well as in stomatal opening in response to low _PROTEIN_ . the stomatal density of week old leaves was similar in wt and plants . thus the high leaf temperature at low _PROTEIN_ in could not be explained by stomatal density but by a reduction of stomatal aperture . the _PROTEIN_ locus was mapped to a location between the cereon single nucleotide polymorphism marker _PROTEIN_ and the original molecular marker on chromosome . sequencing of this kb region revealed that harboured a point mutation at nucleotide that resulted in the exchange of trp for a stop codon . the kb _PROTEIN_ cdna fragment _PROTEIN_ under the control of the camv promoter complemented the smaller mutant phenotype and restored the _PROTEIN_ response in stably transformed _PROTEIN_ . this indicates that _PROTEIN_ is which encodes an uncharacterized protein with a domain of unknown function _PROTEIN_ of amino acids . plant proteins that have a mun domain have been classified as _PROTEIN_ . proteins are crucial components in neurotransmitter release in animals controlling the priming of synaptic vesicles to the release ready state . intracellular _LOCATION_ fusion is generally dependent on the activities of snare complexes . a large helical domain of mammalian the mun domain dramatically accelerates the transition from the closed syntaxin complex to the snare complex and is sufficient for the activity of in synaptic vesicle priming . mun domains are found in diverse proteins from animals plants and fungi . proteins in animals have extensive conserved sequences and domains in addition to the mun domain . we compared the amino acid sequences of the mun domains of two representative proteins . the animal mun domains exhibit weak amino acid identities with _PROTEIN_ and in mun . the sequence identities of _PROTEIN_ with five other arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ members are not high . on the other hand higher plants including monocots and dicots have _PROTEIN_ orthologues with highly conserved homologies distributed across the entire sequences suggesting an essential function . computational biology and available three dimensional structures indicate structural similarity between mun domains of related proteins including _PROTEIN_ and other distantly related vesicle tethering _PROTEIN_ such as the exocyst garp _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ complexes . this suggests that _PROTEIN_ may have a conserved function in intracellular _LOCATION_ fusion . to examine the _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ we used the _PROTEIN_ promoter to drive _PROTEIN_ of the gus reporter and rt pcr analysis with gene specific primers . _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in the whole plant including guard cells . global gene _PROTEIN_ analysis of microarrays indicated that other _PROTEIN_ member genes in arabidopsis were _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in floral organs or in the whole plant similar to _PROTEIN_ . two closely related genes were _PROTEIN_ especially in mature pollen and pollen tubes suggesting roles in pollen germination and tube growth . compared to other _PROTEIN_ member genes with pleiotropic _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels appeared relatively high and the loss of function mutation in _PROTEIN_ impaired stomatal movement and caused growth retardation raising the possibility that _PROTEIN_ has a major function in stomatal response and plant growth . we generated transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fused to the n terminus of the full length _PROTEIN_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to determine the intracellular localization of _PROTEIN_ . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ rescued the mutant phenotype the plants showed increased sensitivity to low _PROTEIN_ due to overexpression of the transgenes . the lipophilic dye is internalized in living cells through endocytosis and can be used to visualize the endocytic pathway from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to the tonoplast . two minutes after the transfer of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants into buffer the _METHOD_ dye exhibited a punctate pattern typical of endosomes with little or no _LOCATION_ staining in hypocotyl epidermal cells . the signal partially colocalized with the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal indicating that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ resides in an endosomal compartment . this finding paralleled results from mouse brain cells where signals from _METHOD_ and also colocalized . when incubated in the dark for h numerous small structures showing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were observed in the guard cells of leaves in transgenic plants their number _PROTEIN_ after min in the light . the structures were rare in the guard cells of well watered and irradiated plants when most of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was detected in close proximity to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . within min after detachment of the leaves small _METHOD_ structures were observed inside the cell . these findings suggest that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ moved reversibly between the cytoplasm and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ depending on environmental conditions . if _PROTEIN_ has a role in intracellular _LOCATION_ traffic it might control the localization of ion transporters that are crucial to stomatal opening _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . stomatal opening is initiated by hyperpolarization of the guard cell _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ caused by h _PROTEIN_ dependent proton efflux . _LOCATION_ hyperpolarization activates inward rectifying potassium channels and induces solute influx followed by water uptake into guard cells . arabidopsis h _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is highly _PROTEIN_ in guard cells and its activation induces stomatal opening . we generated transgenic plants containing a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion gene in the wt _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ background . in wt guard cells _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was localized _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as expected . the internalization rate calculated from the number of guard cells that exhibited small _METHOD_ structures in their _LOCATION_ was in _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants . this rate was significantly higher than that of _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants indicating that _PROTEIN_ affects _PROTEIN_ localization to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the slow anion channel _PROTEIN_ contributes to anion efflux from guard cells and causes _LOCATION_ depolarization resulting in stomatal closure . we compared the distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in transgenic wt and plants . little internalization was observed in the guard cells of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants even in the background _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we examined another transporter aquaporin _PROTEIN_ which is localized in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of guard cells . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ has been used as a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein marker and we also detected _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . in the background the internalization rate of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was slightly increased but remained low _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . these results indicated that _PROTEIN_ is target selective as it is required for the direction of _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but less so for _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . we also examined the localization of the inward rectifying potassium channel _PROTEIN_ in mutants . this voltage gated channel is activated by hyperpolarization and mediates the influx of potassium into guard cells . we could only slightly detect punctate structures of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in mutants indicating that _PROTEIN_ does not affect _PROTEIN_ localization to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to our knowledge the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in wt chloroplast envelopes that we detected has never been discussed before but some figures in a previous report showed similar localization . among the four _METHOD_ tagged _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized proteins in our transgenic plants the _METHOD_ intensity of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was the strongest . as overexpressed _LOCATION_ targeted _METHOD_ fusion proteins have a propensity to form organelle aggregates as a consequence of oligomerization we examined whether the increased internalization rate of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the mutant was caused by _METHOD_ . the monomeric red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ contains mutations compared to dsred and was designed as a non oligomerizing true monomer . the _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ in the mutant appeared as numerous punctate structures in the _LOCATION_ while it exhibited an extremely low _METHOD_ intensity in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ indicating apparent mislocalization of _PROTEIN_ . we further attempted to identify _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ h _PROTEIN_ in the epidermis of rosette leaves using anti h _PROTEIN_ antibodies . the mean value of the _METHOD_ intensity from immunohistochemical staining in was slightly but not statistically significantly lower than in the wt . one reason why no clear difference could be observed is that this method has the potential to detect not only _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ aha but also aha in endosomes . actually intracellular localization of the h _PROTEIN_ has been found by this method probably due to an artifact caused by the fixation for immunohistochemical detection . it also seemed extremely difficult to distinguish endosomal aha from _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ aha in guard cell protoplast proteins and to quantify their amounts . in order to estimate the amount of functional h _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of guard cells we investigated stomatal apertures when h _PROTEIN_ were compulsorily activated . the fungal phytotoxin fusicoccin induces irreversible stomatal opening by the continuous activation of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ h _PROTEIN_ due to inhibition of their dephosphorylation in guard cells . though arabidopsis has at least _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ h _PROTEIN_ and all of which are _PROTEIN_ in guard cells the stomatal response to fc was severely impaired in suggesting that the recruitment of functional h _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was disturbed by the mutation . thus _PROTEIN_ may have a crucial role in the recruitments of not only _PROTEIN_ but also of the other h _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants showed rather strong fc responses indicating increased aha level in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to obtain further insights into the relationship between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we generated transgenic plants co _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . in hypotonic conditions which lead to stomatal opening _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was located in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ while _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seemed to line the _LOCATION_ . in hypertonic conditions which induce stomatal closure _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ partially remained in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seemed to support it . they resided on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ cell wall connection spots that is the tips of hechtian strands in a plasmolyzed guard cells . these relationships suggest that _PROTEIN_ contributes to h _PROTEIN_ localization to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to characterize the function of _PROTEIN_ we compared the phenotypes of the mutant and the _PROTEIN_ overexpressing line . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ exhibited functional complementation of including restored sensitivity to fc and low _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ ox exhibited lower leaf temperature under low _PROTEIN_ than the wt due to enhanced stomatal opening . the rises in stomatal conductance in response to low _PROTEIN_ and light were more rapid and reached higher maximum values in _PROTEIN_ ox than in the wt whereas those in were slow and ceased at low values . enhanced stomatal opening responses in _PROTEIN_ ox plants may contribute to higher _PROTEIN_ assimilation rates even under low _PROTEIN_ . under normal or increased _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ox plants exhibited similar but slightly higher stomatal conductance compared to the wt . however this small difference may be sufficient to elevate the _PROTEIN_ assimilation rate . we examined the response to desiccation stress in _PROTEIN_ ox plants . the rate of transpirational water loss evaluated as the fresh weight _PROTEIN_ of the excised _PROTEIN_ ox leaves resembled that of the wt . this was unlike the response found in the aba deficient mutant _PROTEIN_ that showed excessive water loss owing to constitutive stomatal opening . these results suggested that _PROTEIN_ ox plants control the stomatal aperture efficiently they could open their stomata wider than the wt to _PROTEIN_ higher _PROTEIN_ assimilation rates and close them to prevent extra water loss depending on the environmental conditions . when grown under continuous light for days plants were significantly smaller than the wt _PROTEIN_ p post hoc tukey tests p whereas _PROTEIN_ ox plants were bigger _METHOD_ . thus plant size correlated with _PROTEIN_ assimilation rate under standard _PROTEIN_ . likewise when grown for weeks under short day conditions _PROTEIN_ ox plants were bigger than the wt _PROTEIN_ although rosettes reached the size of wt ones . compared to the wt shorter and longer inflorescence _METHOD_ were observed in and _PROTEIN_ ox respectively when grown under continuous light for a month . similar results were obtained when plants were grown first under short day conditions for weeks and then shifted to long days to induce flowering for more weeks . taken together _PROTEIN_ affects not only stomatal movement but also leaf growth and stem elongation .
