n acylethanolamines are lipids involved in several physiological processes in animal and plant cells . in brain naes are ligands of endocannabinoid receptors which modulate various signaling pathways . in plant naes regulate seed germination and root development and they are involved in plant defense against pathogen attack . this signaling activity is started by an enzyme called n acylphosphatidylethanolamine _PROTEIN_ synthase . this catalyzes the n acylation of phosphatidylethanolamine to form _PROTEIN_ which is most likely hydrolyzed by phospholipase d _METHOD_ to generate nae . this compound is further catabolized by fatty amide hydrolase . the genes encoding the enzymes involved in nae metabolism are well characterized except for the _PROTEIN_ synthase gene . by heterologous _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli and overexpression in plants we characterized an acyltransferase from arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ catalyzing the synthesis of lipids identified as _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the ability of free fatty acid and acyl coa to be used as acyl donor was compared in vitro with e. coli _LOCATION_ and purified enzyme . in both cases _PROTEIN_ was synthesized only in the presence of acyl coa . _PROTEIN_ promoter experiments revealed a strong _PROTEIN_ in roots and young tissues of plants . using yellow _METHOD_ protein fusion we showed that the _PROTEIN_ synthase is located in the _LOCATION_ of plant cells .
to identify and characterize lysolipid acyltransferases from a. thaliana other than the well characterized lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase we sought homologies between the lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase from s. cerevisiae that we previously described and open reading frames of a. thaliana . two sequences were identified _GENE_ and . in the present paper we describe results obtained for _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ sequence presents three of the four conserved domains generally associated with glycerolipid acyltransferases and particularly the blocks i _PROTEIN_ and iii _METHOD_ that might be the catalytic sites of these enzymes . the calculated molecular _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ is kda for amino acids . the phi is estimated at . the sequence analysis of _PROTEIN_ predicts the presence of two transmembrane helixes from amino acid to and from amino acid to . however other prediction sites do not mention these structures _PROTEIN_ . the presence of myristoylation sites prenylation sites and glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor addition sites was also sought using the nmt preps and big _PROTEIN_ plant predictor _METHOD_ . the analysis of this sequence with these _METHOD_ did not evidence post translational modifications . in addition no targeting signal was evidenced using _METHOD_ prediction target p and mitoprot . the complete cdna of _PROTEIN_ was transformed into the e. coli strain . after induction with isopropyl d thiogalactoside the lipids were extracted and analyzed by tlc . as shown in fig . the lipid extract of bacteria transformed with _GENE_ contained an additional lipid class compared with those of bacteria transformed with the empty plasmid . following two dimensional tlc it appeared that this lipid co migrated with _PROTEIN_ standard . this spot was further scraped from the tlc plate and submitted to hydrolysis catalyzed by s. chromofuscus _PROTEIN_ . after the reaction lipids were extracted from the incubation mixture and separated on a tlc plate . as shown in fig . the hydrolysis of the lipid of interest by _PROTEIN_ led to two products identified as nae and phosphatidic acid . these results are in perfect agreement with the claim that _PROTEIN_ catalyzes the synthesis of _PROTEIN_ when _PROTEIN_ in e. coli . to check this assumption the lipid extracts of bacteria transformed with the cdna of _PROTEIN_ or with the empty vector were further analyzed by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . in contrast with results obtained with the lipid extract from bacteria transformed with the empty vector several pseudomolecular ions corresponding to _PROTEIN_ species were detected in the lipid extract purified from bacteria _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . these ions were further characterized by _METHOD_ yielding characteristic fragment ions of _PROTEIN_ species . in agreement with the fatty acid composition of e. coli only _PROTEIN_ containing and chains were detected . as an example the _METHOD_ spectrum of the m/z species and its fragmentation scheme are shown in fig . c and d. diagnostic fragment ions correspond to fatty acid _PROTEIN_ anions and to the losses of these _PROTEIN_ acids . as already described for this type of compound the loss of the sn _PROTEIN_ was more abundant than the loss from the sn position . furthermore the characteristic neutral loss of the n acylethanolamine moiety following the first loss of _PROTEIN_ was also observed making it possible to assign the m/z ion to n stearic oleic palmitoleic phosphatidylethanolamine . more generally results obtained by _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ analysis are consistent with the production of _PROTEIN_ in e. coli cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . therefore we assumed that the _GENE_ gene codes for a _PROTEIN_ synthase from a. thaliana but this hypothesis remained to be confirmed both in vitro and in planta . the ability of _PROTEIN_ to synthesize _PROTEIN_ was analyzed by performing enzymatic assays with labeled free fatty acids or labeled acyl coas and unlabeled pe as substrates . initial experiments were carried out by using _LOCATION_ purified from e. coli transformed with the empty vector or with _GENE_ plasmid . results are shown in table . whatever the experimental conditions used no significant amount of _PROTEIN_ was synthesized by _LOCATION_ purified from e. coli transformed with the empty vector . a similar result was obtained when _LOCATION_ purified from bacteria _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were incubated with pe and ffa . by contrast the same _LOCATION_ synthesized about pmol of _PROTEIN_ when palmitoyl coa or stearoyl coa was used as acyl donor . in a second set of experiments we used the protein _PROTEIN_ fused with a poly his tag purified on an _PROTEIN_ column . the _PROTEIN_ synthase activity associated with the purified fraction was further determined in the presence of pe and ffa or acyl coa as above . as in the case of in vitro assays catalyzed by e. coli _LOCATION_ when ffa was used as the acyl donor no _PROTEIN_ was detected in the reaction mixtures after a min incubation . by contrast and pmol of _PROTEIN_ were synthesized when the purified fraction was incubated with palmitoyl coa or stearoyl coa . moreover since we previously showed that under some specific conditions imidazole is able to catalyze a chemical synthesis of _PROTEIN_ we checked that under the experimental conditions used with the purified fraction the imidazole containing buffer used to elute the protein did not induce a significant synthesis of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the amount of _PROTEIN_ synthesized by the purified enzyme could appear quite low but it must be kept in _PROTEIN_ that the presence of a poly his tag can alter the enzyme activity . in addition as often observed with _LOCATION_ bound enzymes using amphiphilic substrates the activity of the solubilized enzyme was lower than the activity associated with biological _LOCATION_ . nevertheless taken together the present results clearly indicate that _PROTEIN_ is able to synthesize _PROTEIN_ and at least in our experimental conditions the acyl donors used to synthesize _PROTEIN_ are acyl coas and not ffa like the _PROTEIN_ synthase activity from cottonseeds . to complete the functional characterization of the protein under study in planta we purified homozygous lines of the _GENE_ mutant from the salk tdna mutant collection . the tdna insertion in the salk has been located in the gene promoter . in addition we also generated overexpressing lines by placing the _GENE_ cdna under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus s promoter in tdna and plants . four independent overexpressing lines were used in experiments described below . the transcript level of _GENE_ was measured in rosette leaves from week old plants of tdna and overexpressing lines by semiquantitative reverse transcription pcr . by comparison with that observed with plants a weak and an elevated transcript level was measured in tdna and in overexpressing lines respectively . lipids were then extracted from rosette leaves from week old plants of tdna and overexpressing lines and further analyzed by tlc . as expected the major glycerolipids in and tdna plants were phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylinositol pe digalactosyldiacylglycerol and monogalactosyldiacylglycerol and even in lines no _PROTEIN_ was detected . this result is in agreement with the low amounts of _PROTEIN_ detected in various plants by chapman and moore . however large amounts of a compound co migrating with standard _PROTEIN_ were observed in the lipid extract from leaves of all of the overexpressing plants . to confirm the identity of this lipid it was scraped from the tlc plates and analyzed by _METHOD_ analysis . one _PROTEIN_ species was unambiguously identified as a _PROTEIN_ by _METHOD_ and and methyl esters were detected by gc _METHOD_ after transesterification of the fatty acids associated with this lipid . interestingly no shorter fatty acids such as or were detected . moreover in the lipid extracts from all of the overexpressing lines studied _PROTEIN_ was the only additional lipid detected and no overproduction of naes was evidenced . to establish the subcellular location of the _PROTEIN_ synthase we generated _METHOD_ proteins by fusing _METHOD_ to the c terminus or the n terminus of the _GENE_ protein . constructs were transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaf epidermal cells . the fusion proteins appeared to be associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . whatever the construct analyzed we never found any significant label associated with subcellular compartments other than _LOCATION_ . to confirm that _PROTEIN_ synthase protein was located in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ we co _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ _METHOD_ with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ h _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ from nicotiana plumbaginifolia fused with _METHOD_ . fig . clearly shows that both of the fusion proteins co localized thus strengthening the _LOCATION_ location of _PROTEIN_ . to investigate the cell type _PROTEIN_ pattern of the _PROTEIN_ synthase gene we generated transgenic arabidopsis lines that _PROTEIN_ the gus reporter gene under the control of the _PROTEIN_ synthase gene promoter . we further analyzed gus _PROTEIN_ in embryo of imbibed seed and and day old seedlings in roots _METHOD_ and flowers . results are shown in fig . . in the embryo of imbibed seed _PROTEIN_ was detected in the cotyledons and the hypocotyl . in and day old germinating seedlings _PROTEIN_ was detected in the cotyledons the young leaves the shoot and the root apical _METHOD_ and in the roots . no gus activity was detected in the elongation zone of the primary root or in the hypocotyl . when _PROTEIN_ in all of the rosettes from week old plants was compared _PROTEIN_ was preferentially associated with young leaves rather than with old leaves . gus activity declined with leaf maturation but remained constant in roots during seedling development . in flowers gus activity was observed in the filament of stamens in the style and ovary with eggs of pistil . no activity was detected in the _PROTEIN_ sepals pollen sacs anther or stigma .
