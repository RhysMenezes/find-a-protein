light significantly inhibits hypocotyl cell elongation and dark grown seedlings exhibit elongated etiolated hypocotyls . microtubule regulatory proteins function as positive or negative regulators that mediate hypocotyl cell elongation by altering microtubule organization . however it remains unclear how plants coordinate these regulators to promote hypocotyl growth in darkness and inhibit growth in the light . here we demonstrate that wave dampened _PROTEIN_ a microtubule regulatory protein of the _PROTEIN_ family from arabidopsis thaliana functions in hypocotyl cell elongation and is regulated by a ubiquitin proteasome dependent pathway in response to light . _PROTEIN_ rna interference arabidopsis seedlings grown in the light had much longer hypocotyls than controls . moreover _PROTEIN_ overexpression resulted in overall shortening of hypocotyl cells and stabilization of cortical microtubules in the light . cortical microtubule reorganization occurred slowly in cells from _PROTEIN_ rna interference transgenic lines but was accelerated in cells from _PROTEIN_ overexpressing seedlings subjected to light treatment . more importantly _PROTEIN_ protein was abundant in the light but was degraded through the proteasome pathway in the dark . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ inhibited etiolated hypocotyl growth in regulatory particle non _PROTEIN_ subunit mutant _PROTEIN_ plants but not in wild type seedlings . therefore a ubiquitin proteasome dependent mechanism regulates the levels of _PROTEIN_ in response to light to modulate hypocotyl cell elongation .
there are seven _PROTEIN_ like genes in the arabidopsis genome from _PROTEIN_ to . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is significantly altered in brassinosteroid phytohormone mutants based on published microarray data suggesting a potential role of _PROTEIN_ in cell elongation . to analyze the function of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ loss of function and _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ overexpressing seedlings were generated . since knockdown or knockout t dna insertion lines of _PROTEIN_ are unavailable we generated rna interference lines to analyze the function of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . of the fifty five _PROTEIN_ rnai transgenic lines that were obtained had longer hypocotyls after growth in the light . in addition of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overexpressing lines obtained exhibited shorter hypocotyls after growth in the light . line of the _PROTEIN_ rnai transgenic lines and line of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic lines which exhibited typical phenotypes were selected for further analysis . the level of _PROTEIN_ transcription was considerably enhanced in the overexpressing line and was dramatically reduced in the rnai line . in addition the transgenic seedlings of plants carrying _PROTEIN_ without the _METHOD_ tag and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ exhibited similar phenotypes demonstrating that the _METHOD_ tag did not interfere with _PROTEIN_ function . observation of week old seedlings from the _PROTEIN_ overexpressing line revealed that the hypocotyl length was considerably reduced . by contrast the hypocotyls were much longer in the _PROTEIN_ rnai arabidopsis than in wild type plants when the seedlings were grown in the light . statistical analysis using paired student s t tests indicated that these differences in hypocotyl length were significant . scanning electronic microscopy revealed no major differences in the cell profiles of the hypocotyls among the wild type _PROTEIN_ overexpressing and _PROTEIN_ rnai seedlings . the cell numbers in individual hypocotyl epidermal cell files in the different seedlings were similar . the average widths of hypocotyl epidermal cells in wild type _PROTEIN_ overexpressing and _PROTEIN_ rnai seedlings were and respectively . statistical analysis using the paired student s t test indicated that this difference was not significant . however the length of hypocotyl cells was _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ overexpressing seedlings and significantly increased in _PROTEIN_ rnai arabidopsis particularly in the middle region suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is involved in hypocotyl cell elongation . we also measured the elongation rates of hypocotyls at different times and positions along hypocotyls from plants grown in the light . there was little growth of hypocotyl cells in the wild type _PROTEIN_ overexpressing and _PROTEIN_ rnai arabidopsis at days and but the cells were greatly elongated by day especially in the middle region . in comparison to wild type plants the length of _PROTEIN_ rnai hypocotyl cells was significantly increased and the length of _PROTEIN_ overexpressing hypocotyl cells was relatively _PROTEIN_ at days and . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ plays a role in light inhibited hypocotyl elongation . to confirm that the hypocotyl phenotype in the _PROTEIN_ rnai line was linked to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels we randomly selected four additional rnai lines for rt pcr analysis . these results showed that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels corresponded with the long hypocotyl phenotype of plants grown in the light . additionally a second _PROTEIN_ rnai construct using another _PROTEIN_ cdna sequence was generated . seventeen _PROTEIN_ rnai lines exhibited a longer hypocotyl phenotype and three independent _PROTEIN_ rnai lines were selected for further analyses . these results showed that the transcription levels of _PROTEIN_ were dramatically reduced and the hypocotyl length in d old light grown seedlings from the _PROTEIN_ rnai lines was much longer . these results confirm that the longer hypocotyl phenotype of _PROTEIN_ rnai lines grown in the light is dependent upon the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ . because _PROTEIN_ belongs to the _PROTEIN_ family in arabidopsis we detected _PROTEIN_ of other genes in _PROTEIN_ rnai and rnai lines . quantitative real time pcr analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ rnai and rnai lines was similar to the wildtype demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ did not affect transcription levels of other genes in the _PROTEIN_ family . together those results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ plays a negative regulatory role in hypocotyl cell elongation in the light . because _PROTEIN_ belongs to the microtubule regulatory protein _PROTEIN_ family we tested whether increasing or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ affected the organization of cortical microtubules in hypocotyl cells . because the transverse oblique and longitudinal orientation patterns of cortical microtubules are related to the elongation rate of hypocotyl epidermal cells hypocotyls are frequently used to explore the _METHOD_ that underlie cell elongation and cortical microtubule organization . therefore we analyzed cortical microtubules in epidermal cells from the hypocotyl middle region of wild type _PROTEIN_ overexpressing and _PROTEIN_ rnai arabidopsis seedlings carrying tubulin tagged with _METHOD_ . cells were examined at days and of exposure to light . the parallel arrays of cortical microtubules were generally transversely and obliquely oriented relative to the longitudinal hypocotyl growth axis in epidermal cells from wild type hypocotyls . in comparison random oblique or longitudinal cortical microtubules were observed in most of the _PROTEIN_ overexpressing hypocotyl cells while dominantly transverse cortical microtubule arrays were detected in the _PROTEIN_ rnai arabidopsis cells at day . cortical microtubules were mostly oriented in a longitudinal manner in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ overexpressing hypocotyl cells at day while oblique and transverse cortical microtubules were observed in most of the _PROTEIN_ rnai arabidopsis at day . the altered microtubule arrays observed in _PROTEIN_ rnai seedlings were consistent with the significant increase in hypocotyl cell elongation caused by reduced _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . in order to further characterize the effect of _PROTEIN_ on cortical microtubules the microtubule disrupting drug oryzalin was applied to epidermal hypocotyl cells from wild type _PROTEIN_ overexpressing and _PROTEIN_ rnai seedlings . to quantify the effect of oryzalin on the stability of cortical microtubules we estimated the density of cortical microtubules in hypocotyl epidermal cells . a paired student s t test was used to identify significant differences . our results revealed that cortical microtubules were similar in density before oryzalin treatment in the epidermal cells of wild type _PROTEIN_ overexpressing and _PROTEIN_ rnai seedlings . however the number of cortical microtubules in epidermal cells of wild type _PROTEIN_ overexpressing and _PROTEIN_ rnai seedlings was significantly different after drug treatment . microtubules were disrupted in epidermal cells from the _PROTEIN_ rnai line after treatment with oryzalin for min whereas microtubules in wild type and _PROTEIN_ overexpressing cells were largely unaffected . increases in the concentration and duration of oryzalin treatment resulted in disruption of the majority of cortical microtubules in both wild type and _PROTEIN_ rnai arabidopsis cells . however cortical microtubules remained relatively unaffected in _PROTEIN_ overexpressing cells at doses of up to oryzalin . in addition although cortical microtubules mostly recovered in cells from wild type and _PROTEIN_ overexpressing arabidopsis hypocotyls after oryzalin washout many cortical microtubules remained disrupted in cells from _PROTEIN_ rnai arabidopsis hypocotyls . thus microtubules were more sensitive to oryzalin treatment in _PROTEIN_ rnai cells and less sensitive when _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was increased . these results confirm that _PROTEIN_ functions as a microtubule stabilizer . microtubule dynamics were analyzed using confocal time lapse imaging . microtubules with clearly visible leading plus ends were selected for measurement in wild type _PROTEIN_ overexpressing and _PROTEIN_ rnai cells . the results show that microtubule dynamics were altered in _PROTEIN_ overexpressing and rnai hypocotyl epidermal cells . the catastrophe frequency of individual microtubules was significantly lower in _PROTEIN_ overexpressing cells and higher in _PROTEIN_ rnai cells compared with wild type cells suggesting that individual microtubules are more prone to growth when _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is increased but are more likely to shrink in the absence of _PROTEIN_ . unlike plants grown in the light the lengths of etiolated hypocotyls from wild type _PROTEIN_ overexpressing and _PROTEIN_ rnai seedlings were not obviously different suggesting that _PROTEIN_ function is inhibited in the dark . to better understand this phenomenon levels of the _PROTEIN_ transcript were assessed to determine whether _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in the absence of light . a construct was made in which the _PROTEIN_ reporter gene was placed under control of the kb _PROTEIN_ promoter . this construct _PROTEIN_ was introduced into wild type plants using agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation . thirty seven independent transgenic lines were stained for gus activity . gus staining revealed that _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in a majority of the tissues and organs of arabidopsis including the hypocotyls of seedlings grown in the light or in the dark . to verify this result rna was purified from the hypocotyls of light and dark grown wild type seedlings . rt pcr revealed that the _PROTEIN_ transcript was abundant in both light grown and etiolated hypocotyls demonstrating that transcription of _PROTEIN_ does not appear to be regulated by the presence or absence of light . next _PROTEIN_ protein levels were analyzed using _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic seedlings . confocal microscopy showed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ filaments were clearly detected in the hypocotyl epidermal cells of light grown seedlings but not in etiolated hypocotyl epidermal cells of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic lines . protein gel blots using an anti _METHOD_ antibody confirmed this result demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ levels were more abundant in the light and less abundant in the dark . to analyze the potential molecular mechanism of _PROTEIN_ degradation in the dark seedlings were treated with and two proteasome inhibitors . confocal microscopy revealed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was recovered in etiolated hypocotyls from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic seedlings treated with and . by contrast mock treatment with ethanol or with other general protease inhibitors had little or no effect on the degradation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . thus the degradation of _PROTEIN_ is prevented by treatment with proteasome specific inhibitors suggesting that the proteasome is largely responsible for the degradation of _PROTEIN_ in the absence of light . next we examined _PROTEIN_ protein levels during dark light transitions . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic seedlings were grown in darkness for d and then transferred to continuous light for and h. protein gel blots of protein extracts from these seedlings revealed that the abundance of _PROTEIN_ was significantly increased after h and h of light . seedlings grown in continuous light were included as a positive control and the _PROTEIN_ levels in these plants were significantly higher than that of plants subjected to the dark . treatment with cycloheximide an inhibitor of cytoplasmic protein synthesis was then used to determine whether protein degradation or protein synthesis represents the key regulatory step that modulates differential abundance of _PROTEIN_ in light and darkness . six day old _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic seedlings grown in continuous light were transferred to darkness and cultured in the presence of cycloheximide . the cultures were then treated in darkness for and h and the levels of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were measured . samples _PROTEIN_ in the light served as controls . in the absence of cycloheximide the amount of _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ when seedlings were transferred to darkness . the amount of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ within h under both light and dark conditions in the presence of cycloheximide however the rate of _PROTEIN_ was significantly greater at h after transfer to darkness . because cycloheximide effectively blocks new protein synthesis the reduced levels of _PROTEIN_ must therefore be due to the degradation of preexisting protein . together these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is degraded by a proteasome dependent pathway in the absence of light . because our pharmacological results suggested that degradation of the _PROTEIN_ protein was mediated by the proteasome we next tested whether overexpression of _PROTEIN_ could inhibit etiolated hypocotyl growth in a proteasome mutant background . the protein encoded by _PROTEIN_ is a non _PROTEIN_ subunit of the regulatory particles of the proteasome complex in arabidopsis and plays a crucial role in the functioning of the proteasome . therefore we crossed the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plant with _PROTEIN_ a null mutant of _PROTEIN_ . fifteen resulting _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ lines exhibited a shorter etiolated hypocotyl phenotype and line which exhibited the typical phenotype was selected for further analyses . confocal images revealed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was present in filamentous structures in etiolated hypocotyl epidermal cells from homozygous _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings but not _PROTEIN_ transgenic wild type seedlings . these filamentous structures containing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ could be disrupted by treatment with oryzalin and recovered after oryzalin washout demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ is also capable of binding cortical microtubules in the dark . observation of d old etiolated seedlings from _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ lines revealed that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ substantially _PROTEIN_ the etiolated hypocotyl length of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . scanning electronic microscopy revealed no major differences in the cell profiles of hypocotyls between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings . the cell numbers in individual hypocotyl epidermal cell files in different seedlings were similar . the average widths of hypocotyl epidermal cells in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings were and respectively . statistical analysis using paired student s t test indicated that this difference was not significant . however the length of hypocotyl cells was significantly _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic _PROTEIN_ mutants which is consistent with a negative role of _PROTEIN_ in hypocotyl cell elongation . since light induces cortical microtubule reorganization from transverse arrays into oblique and longitudinal patterns in hypocotyl cells after exposure of etiolated plants to light we investigated the effects of _PROTEIN_ on this transition in elongating epidermal cells . wild type _PROTEIN_ overexpressing and _PROTEIN_ rnai seedlings were grown for d in the dark on half strength murashige and skoog _METHOD_ medium followed by exposure to white light for or min . first we assessed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein levels after transfer from darkness to light . protein gel blots showed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ levels were greatly increased after treatment with light for and min . confocal microscopy revealed that after d of growth in the dark parallel arrays of cortical microtubules were transversely oriented relative to the hypocotyl growth axis in epidermal cells from the etiolated hypocotyl upper regions from wild type _PROTEIN_ overexpressing and _PROTEIN_ rnai seedlings . after treatment with light for min transverse and oblique cortical microtubule arrays were dominantly observed in hypocotyl cells of the wild type and _PROTEIN_ rnai seedlings but not in the _PROTEIN_ overexpressing arabidopsis cells . the overexpressing cells predominately exhibited longitudinal microtubule arrays . increasing the duration of treatment induced the formation of longitudinal cortical microtubule arrays in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ overexpressing cells but not in the _PROTEIN_ rnai line . these results indicate that cortical microtubule reorganization was hindered in _PROTEIN_ rnai cells but accelerated in _PROTEIN_ overexpressing cells in response to light treatment demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ is necessary for light regulated cortical microtubule reorganization . given that _PROTEIN_ is required for cortical microtubule stability in hypocotyls and normal hypocotyl cell elongation we investigated the molecular basis for _PROTEIN_ regulation of microtubules in vitro . we cloned the full length _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ into the pgex vector and transformed the plasmid into escherichia coli . the resulting glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ tagged _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was then purified using a glutathione sepharose resin column . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ revealed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was present in two major bands the lower of which was predicted to be a degradation product based on immunoblots using an anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . in order to determine whether _PROTEIN_ binds to microtubules a cosedimentation assay was used to analyze binding of _PROTEIN_ to paclitaxel stabilized microtubules . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was incubated with preformed paclitaxel stabilized microtubules at room temperature for min followed by centrifugation . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ analysis revealed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ alone bound and cosedimented with the microtubules . then the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ was investigated . a construct _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fused with a c terminal _METHOD_ tag under control of the promoter was generated and transiently introduced into arabidopsis cells . confocal microscopy revealed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ formed filamentous structures in pavement cells . the filaments were mostly intact in the presence of latrunculin a a reagent that depolymerizes actin filaments but were disrupted by treatment with the microtubule disrupting reagent oryzalin . after washout of oryzalin the filamentous _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ structures recovered . to confirm this result _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and mbd mcherry were transiently coexpressed in arabidopsis pavement cells . confocal microscopy showed that the green _METHOD_ signal of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overlapped with the red _METHOD_ signal of mbd mcherry confirming that _PROTEIN_ localized to microtubules . colocalization was analyzed by plotting the signal intensities of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and mbd mcherry using imagej software . filamentous structures that could be disrupted by oryzalin but not lata were also observed in hypocotyl epidermal cells of arabidopsis seedlings stably _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . by contrast actin filaments decorated with stably _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were disrupted by treatment with lata . these data demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ colocalizes with microtubules in vitro and in cells . effects of _PROTEIN_ on microtubules were investigated by confocal and electron microscopy . paclitaxel stabilized microtubules polymerized from rhodamine labeled tubulins exhibited single filament patterns in the absence of _PROTEIN_ as observed using confocal microscopy and negative staining electron microscopy . however addition of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ resulted in formation of large microtubule bundles . to strip _PROTEIN_ from the microtubules mm nacl was added to the reaction . following the addition of nacl _PROTEIN_ induced microtubule bundles dispersed into single filaments . to further confirm microtubule bundling by _PROTEIN_ a low speed cosedimentation assay was performed . arabidopsis microtubule bundling protein was used as a control . tubulin was assembled at for min in the presence or absence of _PROTEIN_ or and centrifuged at . microtubules alone did not sediment following low speed centrifugation . however the majority of microtubules appeared in the low speed pellets when incubated with _PROTEIN_ or the fusion protein . these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ plays a role in microtubule bundling . next we tested whether _PROTEIN_ could protect microtubules against cold induced and dilution induced depolymerization . which has been shown to stabilize microtubules under these conditions was used as a control . rhodamine labeled tubulin was incubated in the presence and absence of _PROTEIN_ or to allow tubulin polymerization . the solutions were then incubated at for min or diluted with prewarmed buffer and incubated at for min prior to fixation . after fixation the samples were observed by confocal microscopy . the results showed that microtubule filaments in the absence of _PROTEIN_ were fully disassembled after cold and dilution treatments . however many microtubules persisted in the presence of _PROTEIN_ and after the cold and dilution treatments . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is capable of stabilizing microtubules against low temperature and dilution induced depolymerization .

pem buffer containing _PROTEIN_ or and incubated for min at prior to fixation . samples were fixed with glutaraldehyde for observation by confocal microscopy . a dna fragment of the _PROTEIN_ promoter

into the vector . the resulting construct was then transformed into arabidopsis plants using agrobacterium tumefaciens by the arabidopsis floral dip method . thirty seven independent transgenic lines were obtained and the homozygous seedlings were used for histochemical localization of gus activity in hypocotyl cells . the gus staining procedure was performed as previously described by citation . three day old etiolated wild type _PROTEIN_ overexpressing or _PROTEIN_ rnai arabidopsis with a _METHOD_ tubulin background grown on half strength _METHOD_ medium were treated with light for and min and cortical microtubules were observed using confocal microscopy . to prepare stable _PROTEIN_ rnai arabidopsis lines a _PROTEIN_ rnai vector was generated by amplifying or bp _PROTEIN_ coding sequences in the sense and antisense orientations and inserting them into the vector . primers used for amplification of _PROTEIN_ rnai sequences were _PROTEIN_ and ggcgcgcccgcctcgaagctccttttg and cggatccatttaaatcttcgttccgatccactg and tctagaggcgcgcccgcctcgaagctccttttg . the following primers were used for amplification of _PROTEIN_ rnai sequences ccatggatggatatctgtatggacaag and ctcgagtgaagcacgtttctcagttg and ggatccccatggatggatatctgtatggacaag and tctagactcgagtgaagcacgtttctcagttg . to stably _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the full length _PROTEIN_ cdna was amplified by pcr and subcloned into the vector which _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under control of the promoter and a nopaline synthase terminator . _METHOD_ was amplified and inserted at the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ . the cdnas encoding _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ were then amplified and subcloned into the _PROTEIN_ vector and transformed into wild type arabidopsis plants with agrobacterium . the transgenic homozygous arabidopsis lines from the generation were used . rt pcr and quantitative real time pcr analysis was performed to assess _PROTEIN_ and other _PROTEIN_ transcript levels in _PROTEIN_ rnai rnai and overexpressing seedlings . total rna was isolated using _PROTEIN_ reagent followed by treatment with rnase free dnase i at for min to degrade genomic dna . the treated rna samples were used as templates for first strand cdna synthesis . real time pcr was performed using applied _METHOD_ real time pcr system with sybr premix ex taq . relative _PROTEIN_ levels were calculated as described . all experiments were
