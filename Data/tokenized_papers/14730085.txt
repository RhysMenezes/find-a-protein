mitochondria import hundreds of _LOCATION_ synthesized proteins via the mitochondrial protein import apparatus . _PROTEIN_ analysis in various organs of components of the arabidopsis mitochondrial protein import apparatus encoded by genes showed that although many were present in small multigene families often only one member was prominently _PROTEIN_ . this was supported by comparison of real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and microarray experimental data with _PROTEIN_ sequence tag numbers and _METHOD_ parallel signature sequence data . _METHOD_ spectrometric analysis of purified mitochondria identified import components their mitochondrial sub compartment and verified the presence of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and metaxin proteins for the first time to our knowledge . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ detected _METHOD_ correlated with the most abundant gene transcript measured by _PROTEIN_ data . treatment of arabidopsis cell culture with mitochondrial electron transport chain inhibitors rotenone and antimycin a resulted in a significant increase in transcript levels of import components with a greater increase observed for the minor _METHOD_ . the increase was observed h after treatment indicating that it was likely a secondary response . microarray analysis of rotenone treated cells indicated the up regulation of gene sets involved in mitochondrial chaperone activity protein degradation respiratory chain assembly and division . the rate of protein import into isolated mitochondria from rotenone treated cells was halved even though rotenone had no direct effect on protein import when added to mitochondria isolated from untreated cells . these findings suggest that transcription of import component genes is induced when mitochondrial function is limited and that minor gene _METHOD_ display a greater response than the predominant _METHOD_ .
bioinformatic approaches have identified putative components of the arabidopsis mitochondrial protein import machinery encoded by genes . to investigate the _PROTEIN_ patterns of the putative protein import machinery genes quantitative real time reverse transcriptase pcr analysis was used to measure transcript abundance in arabidopsis cotyledons roots leaves and flowers . initially we measured the transcript abundance of ribosomal proteins that are required in the three cellular compartments where translation takes place . transcripts of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ encoded ribosomal proteins that reside in the mitochondria and _LOCATION_ respectively were found in all arabidopsis organs examined . in cotyledons the transcript abundance of these two genes was highest at d after germination and _PROTEIN_ as the plant aged . in roots the transcript abundance increased to peak at d then _PROTEIN_ . message levels of the _LOCATION_ encoded chloroplast ribosomal protein _PROTEIN_ were similar to the _LOCATION_ and mitochondrial rps genes in cotyledons leaves and flowers whereas the transcript abundance in roots was very low as expected . message levels for the genes encoding the plant mitochondrial protein import machinery were measured . with only one exception transcripts for all genes were found in all samples examined indicating that all were _PROTEIN_ . the exception was which displayed _PROTEIN_ below reliable detection levels . in roots transcript abundance of the _PROTEIN_ and tom components predominantly peaked at and d after germination then _PROTEIN_ significantly by d. interestingly like the chloroplast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ message was present at very low levels in roots compared with other organs possibly indicating that it was not utilized in nongreen organs . as in roots message levels in cotyledons for most components were generally highest at to d but significantly _PROTEIN_ by d. however _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and displayed a more constant transcript abundance over cotyledon development . _PROTEIN_ again showed an _PROTEIN_ profile differing from the general pattern in cotyledons increasing over development . all genes were _PROTEIN_ in leaves and flowers . included in this analysis was the arabidopsis homolog of metaxin the outer _LOCATION_ receptor for animal mitochondrial protein import . the arabidopsis homolog displays amino acid identity to human and fruitfly metaxin proteins . previously uncharacterized in plants the similarity of the arabidopsis metaxin _PROTEIN_ pattern to that of other import components provides preliminary evidence of it being the plant homolog of the metaxin protein import receptor in animals . quantitative real time rt pcr was also used to compare the absolute transcript abundance for each import component in arabidopsis cell culture . most import components displayed similar transcript levels except for the low quantity of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and metaxin . in yeast it has been calculated that tom complexes are approximately times more abundant than _PROTEIN_ complexes . this stoichiometry was not observed in the transcript abundance of tom and _PROTEIN_ import components in arabidopsis cell culture . therefore the low message abundance of these components may indicate other means of regulation such as rna stability translation efficiency and/or protein turnover . many import components are encoded in multiple gene families that generally display high sequence similarity . the gene families each possess a predominant isoform that had the highest transcript abundance in cell culture . the predominance of specific _METHOD_ was also evident in whole plants as supported by a comparison of the message abundance in cell culture with the levels measured in arabidopsis cotyledons roots leaves and flowers . with the exception of the majority of these organs displayed the same predominant _METHOD_ as observed in the cell culture . additional support for the presence of predominant _METHOD_ was obtained by analysis of the _METHOD_ parallel signature sequence _PROTEIN_ project data _PROTEIN_ sequence tag numbers and our microarray analysis of arabidopsis cell culture all of which generally showed similar _PROTEIN_ patterns to the real time rt pcr data . _PROTEIN_ data were present for several different organs for both real time rt pcr and _PROTEIN_ experiments . however because growth conditions and sample particulars varied between the two different approaches the data were adjusted as indicated in materials and methods. as seen in the transcript abundance in arabidopsis cell culture the comparison of real time rt pcr microarray _PROTEIN_ and est data did not reveal a distinct predominant isoform but indicated that they were present at similar levels . the predominant isoform within the gene families of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was the same _PROTEIN_ of the technique used whereas for _PROTEIN_ and there was a significant discrepancy in the isoform that predominated using one technique . for real time rt pcr microarray and _PROTEIN_ data were similar but est numbers did not agree . for real time rt pcr data did not agree with the other approaches . real time rt pcr and microarray data for _PROTEIN_ indicated that _PROTEIN_ message levels were very low whereas _PROTEIN_ transcript abundance was fold higher . this was not in agreement with _PROTEIN_ and est data which indicated that both _PROTEIN_ genes had similar transcript levels . _PROTEIN_ was not represented by ests or _PROTEIN_ data perhaps because its transcript appears to be present at very low levels . unfortunately probe pairs to detect _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were not present on the affymetrix _PROTEIN_ genechip . highly enriched mitochondrial preparations were isolated from arabidopsis cell culture and fractionated into four sub compartments inner _LOCATION_ outer _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and intermembrane space . although the purity of the mitochondrial preparation is approximately the subfractionation procedure is an enrichment process rather than a high purity separation hence the intermembrane space is nearly contaminated by _PROTEIN_ the outer _LOCATION_ contains to inner _LOCATION_ and the inner _LOCATION_ contains a significant amount of still attached outer _LOCATION_ portions . protein aliquots from whole mitochondria and the sub fractions were trypsin digested to identify peptides from import components by an liquid chromatography tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ strategy of shotgun sequencing of peptides . peptides from different import components were identified in the mitochondria and sub fraction aliquots . in all cases of import components encoded in multiple gene families the peptides identified were from the predominant isoform apparent from the cell culture transcript analysis . notably with _PROTEIN_ the proteomic identification of _PROTEIN_ matches the _PROTEIN_ data we obtained by real time pcr and microarray analysis . this reveals a close correlation between the highly _PROTEIN_ members of the gene families and the presence of the encoded protein in the mitochondria . subfractionation of the mitochondria assisted in the identification of six import components that were clearly too low in abundance to be readily detected in whole mitochondrial isolates . enrichment of intermembrane space proteins which normally constitute approximately of the total mitochondrial protein content enabled identification of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ known in yeast to function in the intermembrane space . inner _LOCATION_ enrichment allowed identification of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ whereas was only identified after enrichment of outer _LOCATION_ . the identification of import components from the mitochondrial sub compartments in which they are found in yeast reinforces the hypothesis that they are the authentic plant mitochondrial protein import components . the small _PROTEIN_ proteins were readily identified in the intermembrane space but were largely absent from other compartments . the outer _LOCATION_ enriched fractions contained the three key tom complex subunits but we did not identify the small _METHOD_ or the _PROTEIN_ translocase subunits in this fraction . the inner _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ subunits _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were found in the enriched inner _LOCATION_ and whole mitochondrial samples but were not identified in the soluble fractions investigated . the _PROTEIN_ subunits were identified in all fractions which in our opinion does not suggest localization outside the inner _LOCATION_ but rather their high abundance in mitochondrial samples . the import components directly identified in mitochondrial samples encompass nearly the entire plant mitochondrial protein import apparatus as characterized by comparison with yeast and mammalian _METHOD_ . specific peptides from both and were sequenced in our analysis which correlates with the similar transcript abundance of both _METHOD_ of this family observed in the real time rt pcr microarray _PROTEIN_ and est data . this also correlates with the dominant _METHOD_ of detected by werhahn et al . in the purified tom complex from arabidopsis . the absence of two of the small tom components _PROTEIN_ may be explained by the relative paucity of suitable peptides generated by trypsin digestion of small proteins . however and _PROTEIN_ have been identified in purified tom complex from arabidopsis mitochondria . the data presented in table i constitute the first experimental identification of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and metaxin proteins . import component peptides identified by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of trypsin digested mitochondria we investigated if gene _PROTEIN_ of components of the mitochondrial protein import apparatus responded to changes in mitochondrial activity . to assess this we added inhibitors to the mitochondrial electron transport chain and assessed changes in gene _PROTEIN_ at and h after addition . gene _PROTEIN_ was measured in this period to assess if changes in _PROTEIN_ occurred immediately i.e . to h or were a secondary affect i.e . h. mitochondria were chemically stressed with rotenone or antimycin a compounds that inhibit the action of complexes i and iii of the mitochondrial electron transport chain respectively . both chemicals were added at concentrations intended to perturb mitochondrial function and did not result in cell death as determined by vital stains and oxygen consumption assays . cell samples were taken and h after treatment for quantitative real time pcr analysis . in addition cells treated with rotenone were collected after h for analysis using full genome affymetrix genechip _PROTEIN_ microarrays . table ii lists groups of genes identified in the microarray analysis with altered transcript abundance after rotenone treatment fold induction and microarray signal value listed for each . these genes encode proteins involved in diverse mitochondrial activities mitochondrial protein import components molecular chaperones proteins involved in respiratory chain complex assembly protein degradation and mitochondrial division . twelve import component genes were up regulated more than fold after rotenone treatment including those encoding pore forming subunits _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and outer _LOCATION_ receptor components . the concurrent increase in transcript abundance of eight of genes encoding mitochondrial molecular chaperone proteins suggests a requirement for the folding and assembly of proteins in the mitochondria . also up regulated were genes encoding arabidopsis proteins similar to yeast proteins involved in the correct assembly of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes bcs required for the assembly of a functional cytochrome complex _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and surfeit required for the assembly of the cytochrome oxidase complex and an m aaa protease required for the assembly of _PROTEIN_ synthase . a zinc metalloprotease involved in the rapid degradation of mitochondrial presequences after they have been removed by _PROTEIN_ was up regulated fold . in addition genes possibly involved in mitochondrial division _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were up regulated . microarray measurements of changes in transcript abundance after rotenone treatment quantitative real time rt pcr analysis of the transcript abundance of import components in cells treated with antimycin a or rotenone at and h was performed to confirm the microarray data and determine whether the changes observed in the microarray analysis were primary or secondary responses to the chemical treatments . shown are the import components that displayed significant changes in transcript abundance in comparison with the control . in addition the microarray fold change is indicated for comparison with the fold change measured by real time rt pcr . probe pairs to detect _PROTEIN_ were not present on the affymetrix _PROTEIN_ genechip so real time rt pcr was used to quantify the changes in transcript abundance . the fold changes in transcript abundance as measured by real time rt pcr were very similar in most cases to the fold changes observed in the microarray analysis . the transcript abundance changes of _PROTEIN_ metaxin and _PROTEIN_ observed by microarray analysis were not supported by the quantitative real time rt pcr analysis . of the _PROTEIN_ components seven genes showed significant up regulation after rotenone treatment whereas only _PROTEIN_ showed a _PROTEIN_ in transcript abundance . moreover except for _PROTEIN_ the highest fold change was observed after h indicating that this was likely to be a secondary response . _PROTEIN_ transcript abundance doubled only h after rotenone treatment possibly indicating an early response of the carrier import pathway . the message levels of the small _PROTEIN_ components did not change after inhibitor treatment but they may not be rate limiting in the carrier import pathway . the five tom components changed primarily h after treatment . comparison of the fold changes of the import components h after rotenone treatment revealed an interesting trend . the fold change in up regulated minor import component _METHOD_ was greater than that of the induced predominant _METHOD_ perhaps indicating a specialized role for the minor import component _METHOD_ as stress responsive genes . in addition the highest inductions of the minor _METHOD_ involved the pore forming import components _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the microarray gene _PROTEIN_ profiles after rotenone treatment of cell culture indicates an increase in the _PROTEIN_ of genes encoding mitochondrial protein import components and mitochondrial biogenesis in general . the increase of several mitochondrial proteases may be required to replace real damaged components of mitochondria because of the rotenone treatment or the perception of damage because of the partial inactivation of electron transport capacity . to test if rotenone treatment of cells affects protein import in vitro protein import assays were performed with mitochondria isolated from control and rotenone treated cells . import of the arabidopsis _LOCATION_ encoded mitochondrial protein _PROTEIN_ was lower in mitochondria isolated from arabidopsis cell culture h after rotenone treatment . time course experiments indicated that the rate of import into mitochondria isolated from rotenone treated cells was approximately of the control rate . addition of rotenone to mitochondria isolated from untreated cells with rotenone immediately before import did not result in a significant change in the rate of protein import indicating import per se was not being directly inhibited by rotenone .

this article at http //www.plantphysiol.org . to compare the _PROTEIN_ patterns of the various genes obtained from quantitative rt pcr _PROTEIN_ and microarrays the data were normalized as follows . for each experimental approach the transcript abundance of every gene was averaged over the different organ types then within each gene family these average message levels of the different _METHOD_ were normalized with the most abundant isoform given the arbitrary value of . this enabled comparison of the average transcript abundance of different _METHOD_ within a gene family in all organs analyzed and between real time rt pcr and _PROTEIN_ data . within each gene family microarray signal values and est numbers were normalized against the isoform with the highest transcript abundance allowing comparison of microarray data and est numbers in each gene family with real time rt pcr and _PROTEIN_ data . microarray analysis of the changes in transcript abundance in arabidopsis cell culture was performed using affymetrix genechip arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ genome arrays . total rna was isolated from arabidopsis cell culture h after treatment with rotenone using the rneasy plant mini protocol . the high quality of the total rna was verified by using both an agilent bioanalyzer and spectrophotometric analysis of the to ratio . six flasks of arabidopsis cell culture were treated with rotenone and combined into two separate pools . total rna was isolated from each of the two pools after crna sample preparation each was analyzed on separate genechips resulting in two biological replicates of rotenone treated cells . six untreated control cell culture flasks were prepared similarly resulting in two biological replicates of control treated cells . double stranded cdna synthesis biotin labeled crna target synthesis target hybridization washing staining and scanning were performed exactly as described in the affymetrix genechip _PROTEIN_ analysis technical manual using the kits chemicals and reagents precisely as outlined . control oligo _PROTEIN_ and biotinylated hybridization controls were included in the hybridization . before hybridization to an _PROTEIN_ genechip the crna target quality was assessed by hybridization of an aliquot of the prepared crna to a array . hybridization was performed in an affymetrix genechip hybridization oven . washing and staining were performed using an affymetrix fluidics station . scanning was performed with an agilent genearray scanner _PROTEIN_ . genechip scans were initially analyzed using the affymetrix microarray suite software from which pivotdata tables were exported . raw data from the pivotdata tables were analyzed in genespring software version using the parameters suggested by silicon genetics

and intermembrane space was performed as described previously based on the methods outlined by sweetlove et al . . for in vitro import experiments arabidopsis cell culture mitochondria were isolated after h of chemical treatment . mitochondrial protein extracts were acetone precipitated at overnight . fifty _METHOD_ of protein was digested with of trypsin overnight at in mm tris . resulting tryptic peptides were differentially separated over h using a mm zorbax column and injected directly into q star pulsar i _METHOD_ _METHOD_ via an electrospray source . peptides were automatically selected by analyst _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ for _METHOD_ analysis and fragmented with . _METHOD_ spectra and collision _METHOD_ data were analyzed and matched to predicted gene products with bioanalyst and proid software _METHOD_ using _METHOD_ accuracy cutoffs of peptide _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . collison induced dissociations were also analyzed by mascot _PROTEIN_ for independent matching . arabidopsis ribosomal protein _PROTEIN_ was amplified using primers designed to sequences obtained from cdna to the rps gene . met labeled precursor proteins were synthesized using the rabbit reticulocyte tnt in

mitochondrial isolations and in vitro import reactions were performed .
