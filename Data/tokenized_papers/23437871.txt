nitrilases are proteins as shown for recombinantly _PROTEIN_ bacterial protein in vitro . aggregation of arabidopsis _METHOD_ was observed in early stages of pcd by cutler somerville but _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of plant nitrilases were not characterized . there are four genes encoding nitrilases in the arabidopsis thaliana genome . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ code for proteins sharing high amino acid similarities while their similarity with _PROTEIN_ is lower . there are orthologues of _PROTEIN_ in bacteria fungi and animals . in order to study the biochemical properties of the protein and its cellular distribution we prepared antibody against a peptide derived from the of _PROTEIN_ . on western blots of crude extracts of arabidopsis cultured cells and seedlings the affinity purified antibody detected a band of c. kda corresponding to the calculated _PROTEIN_ molecular _METHOD_ . we also prepared _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ fusion constructs under the control of the camv promoter _METHOD_ _METHOD_ as well as a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion under the control of _PROTEIN_ promoter _METHOD_ . we transformed arabidopsis cultured cells and plants using these constructs . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins had the expected kda molecular _METHOD_ detected on western blots as a single band . in order to learn about _PROTEIN_ molecular _METHOD_ we used differential centrifugation . differential centrifugation from crude cellular extracts showed that endogenous _PROTEIN_ remained in the supernatant and a portion of it was pelleted to the microsomal fraction at g . at g a further fraction of _PROTEIN_ was pelleted from the . the _PROTEIN_ that _PROTEIN_ was sedimented to pellets also when differential centrifugation was performed with the nonionic detergent suggested that higher molecular _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ were not _LOCATION_ . differential centrifugation performed from extracts of cells transformed with _METHOD_ construct showed a similar distribution of _METHOD_ to the endogenous _PROTEIN_ . the presence of _PROTEIN_ in large molecular assemblies was also indicated by the broad range of molecular _METHOD_ of the immunopurified _METHOD_ separated under native conditions by blue native _PROTEIN_ . similarly gel filtration chromatography of the microsomal pellets also showed a broad size distribution of _PROTEIN_ with no significant maxima ranging from the column void volume at > mda through to fractions of c. _METHOD_ . we conclude that _PROTEIN_ exists both as soluble and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . in order to analyse the composition of the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ we immunopurified the complex through the _METHOD_ tag and identified the proteins from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ silver stained gels by _METHOD_ . together with _METHOD_ we found untagged endogenous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in almost equimolar amounts suggesting that the large molecular _METHOD_ _METHOD_ are assemblies of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . next we analysed the _METHOD_ fractions from gel filtration enriched for _PROTEIN_ based on western blot detection by electron microscopy . negative stain em revealed highly ordered linear filaments of variable lengths . these polymers of up to nm or occasionally longer exhibited helical substructures strongly resembling the earlier described filaments of recombinant bacterial nitrilase assembled in vitro . closer inspection and measurements of several independent preparations demonstrated that the arabidopsis putative nitrilase filaments have a uniform diameter of nm . to confirm the identity of filaments we performed immunogold labelling of the samples from gel filtration with antibody . as shown in fig . the filamentous structures were specifically decorated by the antibody and secondary antibody coupled with gold particles . _PROTEIN_ labelling was preferentially associated with more open parts of the filaments probably due to better accessibility of the epitope . taken together our biochemical analysis revealed the _METHOD_ assemblies of arabidopsis nitrilases that were visualized by em as filamentous assemblies . we confirmed the aggregation of _PROTEIN_ in the vicinity of _LOCATION_ described by cutler somerville . however we also noticed microtubular localization in untreated proliferating cells which we characterized further in arabidopsis cultured cells by _METHOD_ labelling with affinity purified antibody against _PROTEIN_ and antibody or in cells transformed with _METHOD_ construct . _PROTEIN_ was mostly present in the cytoplasm but in mitotic cells it localized with microtubules . a weak signal was associated with the preprophase band of cortical microtubules in metaphase _PROTEIN_ was enriched in the spindle area and during cytokinesis _PROTEIN_ was present in the phragmoplast area and in the area of cell plate formation . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ under its own promoter in several stable cultured arabidopsis cell lines showed similar localization patterns in vivo as observed for endogenous _PROTEIN_ protein visualized by _METHOD_ . in interphase the signals for _METHOD_ were present in the cytoplasm in the vicinity of the _LOCATION_ and weakly in the _LOCATION_ . a portion of _METHOD_ signal was localized with the mitotic spindle and was enriched with the phragmoplast during cytokinesis . when _PROTEIN_ was driven from the camv promoter the _METHOD_ signal was stronger particularly in the cytoplasm . however the enrichment of _METHOD_ with mitotic spindle and cytokinetic apparatus was comparable to that observed for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ from its own promoter . the microtubule associated _PROTEIN_ signal was enriched in cells . to confirm the association of _PROTEIN_ with microtubules we performed a assay with polymerization of microtubules from supernatant . as shown in fig . _PROTEIN_ was detected with pelleted plant microtubules in the presence of taxol but not in negative controls without taxol . however unlike that became further enriched in the pellet by the addition of brain microtubules the portion of _PROTEIN_ pelleted in the presence or absence of brain microtubules remained approximately the same . next we depolymerized microtubules with amiprophos methyl which led to the dispersion of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ . as we showed previously the remnants of kinetochore microtubules left after apm treatment are abundantly decorated with but hardly any _PROTEIN_ signal could be detected with the kinetochore microtubular stubs . our data showed that a portion of _PROTEIN_ protein was associated with microtubules but not with sites of microtubule nucleation . signal for _METHOD_ under the control of its native promoter was observed predominantly in the meristematic zone of primary roots and in developing young leaves . in proliferating cells the _METHOD_ signal was diffusely present in the cytoplasm . as in cultured cells it was somewhat enriched with mitotic microtubules . as cells exit proliferation the _LOCATION_ signal became stronger in cells at the expansion and differentiation zones of roots . the _PROTEIN_ mutant allele was originally identified based on its resistance to auxin but _PROTEIN_ it was shown that iaa synthesis rates and concentrations were similar to . _PROTEIN_ are members of a small gene family with overlapping _PROTEIN_ pattern and possibly redundant functions . to gain insights into nitrilase function we downregulated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis plants using a dsrna interference construct composed of a hairpin with inverted repeats corresponding to a fragment of the central part of the _PROTEIN_ molecule with significant sequence similarities to _PROTEIN_ homologues . several independent transformations were performed with the construct alongside an empty vector using the arabidopsis ecotype columbia an arabidopsis line _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ marker for tubulin _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ marker for _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . independent of the genetic backgrounds and the transformation events the transformants with showed similar phenotypes ranging from milder to severe reduction of leaf and root growth . the phenotypes were not observed in plants transformed with empty vector . when the first true leaves of plants developed they were small and _PROTEIN_ abaxial _PROTEIN_ and tissue organization was gradually lost and leaves turned into disorganized structures . in the strongest cases structures were formed at the shoot apex instead of true leaves from the very beginning . plants with reduced levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ could not reach maturity and produce seeds and therefore we could only analyse seedlings in the generation . to link the developmental abnormalities to the transformation with the construct we counted the frequency of transformants showing the phenotype obtained from independent transformations carried out at different times . we found that the phenotype always occurred with a frequency ranging from to while with the empty vector this was . we determined by quantitative the reduction of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in c. independent transformants showing the characteristic phenotypes . there was c. reduction in three of the nitrilases _PROTEIN_ in the transformants compared to the controls . to correlate the strength of phenotypes with the reduction of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ we analysed independent transformants with phenotypes ranging from milder to severe abnormalities in true leaf differentiation and compared the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels to that of controls . the reduction of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the lines correlated with the severity of the observed phenotypes . furthermore similar developmental defects were not found in plants transformed with other unrelated dsrna constructs such as _PROTEIN_ or suggesting that the phenotypes we observed are specific for the construct and are the result of the silencing of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in order to further analyse the leaf developmental defects we microscopically inspected the first true leaves of seedlings from at least independent seedlings with developmental abnormalities that were labelled with dapi to stain _LOCATION_ . all of these plants showed similar type of defects at the cellular level typical examples are shown in fig . . cells of young leaves of plants became large with grossly enlarged _LOCATION_ in comparison to the control . also the regular line of marginal cells was disrupted and replaced by protrusions from highly enlarged cells . the enlarged cells of young malformated leaves of plants retained a high _LOCATION_ to cytoplasm volume ratio typical for cells of meristem and leaf primordial and did not become vacuolated . correspondingly cells with giant _LOCATION_ remained mitotically active . we observed all stages of mitosis from prophase to anaphase with a highly increased number of chromosomes ranging from to instead of the regular diploid number of in wild type . this suggested that the increased _LOCATION_ size did not arise through the process of endoreduplication but likely through abnormal cell division . in order to confirm the increased ploidy we analysed dna content by flow cytometry . we collected newly emerging leaves and older leaves from seedlings d post germination from wt plants and the malformed leaves from seedlings at the same age . in control seedlings cells of leaves have entered endoreduplication and increased dna content up to while cells of the newly emerging leaves were still diploid with and dna content . by contrast as shown in fig . for the malformed leaves of a grossly increased dna content up to and an almost complete lack of dna level were observed . to prove that the increased dna content measured by flow cytometry in leaves is caused by polyploidy and not by increased level of endoreduplication which naturally occurs in plant cells during development we counted chromocentra . the chromocentra are formed by heterochromatin aggregates corresponding to mitotic centromeres . the average number of chromocentra in plants was compared to in control plants . in addition in cells of leaves there is a broad variation in chromocentra number which also corresponds with the lack of distinct peaks in the flow cytometry measurements and indicates high genome instability in the plants . the mitotic figures and the counting of chromocentra firmly established that increased dna content in the cells is not the consequence of elevated levels of endoreduplication . taken together our data show that nitrilases are required to repress the entry into proliferation and in their absence cells become largely polyploid . as polyploid cells often show cytokinetic failure we searched for cytokinetic defects . although the cotyledons of seedlings had no morphological abnormalities closer inspection revealed that of stomata were aberrant . cytokinetic defects of stomata in cotyledons were early signs of the phenotype in transformants . undivided mother guard cells single guard cells cells with aborted cell wall stubs all indicating defective cytokinesis were observed in cotyledons of seedlings . abortive cytokinesis of stomata was also present in hypocotyls of seedlings . in true leaves with milder phenotypes stomata were present but both the stomata and pavement cells had extremely frequent cytokinetic defects . hallmarks of aberrant cytokinesis such as cell wall stubs enlarged _LOCATION_ fusion of _LOCATION_ or binuclear cells were all abundant . binuclear cells remained in the cell cycle and were capable to enter into as revealed by positive labelling of replicating _LOCATION_ after a h pulse in edu assay . although c. independent transformants were evaluated we did not observe clustering of stomata indicating that the cytokinesis but not cell lineage patterning during stomata development was affected in plants . although developmental abnormalities were more prominent in aerial parts root development was also affected by silenced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . at the elongation zone where normally cells exit the cell cycle in a large proportion of cells still remained in proliferation . the abnormally enlarged _LOCATION_ were detected by edu labelling to go through dna synthesis . in comparison to wt roots the meristematic zone of primary roots of seedlings was markedly shortened and malformed there were irregular cell files with cells having enlarged _LOCATION_ or two _LOCATION_ suggesting defects in cytokinesis also in root cells . we aimed to study the effect of overexpression of _METHOD_ driven by the promoter but among independent transformants we could not obtain lines with significant overexpression and plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at comparable levels to had no discernible phenotypic effects . this indicates that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in plants is tightly regulated . contrary to moderate _PROTEIN_ found in the plants we could obtain lines with high _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in cultured arabidopsis cells transformed with the _METHOD_ construct . the effect of _METHOD_ overproduction on growth and division was analysed in three independent transformed cell lines . to determine whether the entry into is affected by higher _PROTEIN_ levels we applied a h pulse labelling of edu immediately after subculture of stationary grown cells . as shown in fig . the proportion of cells labelled for during the first h after subculture was reduced to in the _METHOD_ overexpression line as compared to the control . reduced entry and pass through in _METHOD_ overexpressing lines was confirmed also by flow cytometry . we found a lower proportion of cells with _PROTEIN_ dna content h after subculture in _METHOD_ overexpression lines as compared to control . the lower number of cells progressing through the cell cycle within h after subculture corresponded to the lower mitotic index . furthermore the growth rate of the overexpression lines determined by measuring fresh cell _METHOD_ was lower compared to control . _PROTEIN_ is implicated in pcd both in animal and plant cells . clustering of _METHOD_ in early pcd of arabidopsis was described by cutler somerville . to confirm whether _METHOD_ behaves similarly in our experiments we used acetylsalicylic acid . pcd in arabidopsis cell cultures as shown by et al . and by us . _METHOD_ labelling of endogenous protein or confocal microscopy imaging of _METHOD_ in vivo showed a patchy signal for _PROTEIN_ accumulated in the perinuclear area or even penetrated into the _LOCATION_ in cells . accumulation of _METHOD_ in perinuclear area and in _LOCATION_ was observed also after aphidicolin induced replication stress . we further addressed whether the overexpression of _METHOD_ alters the frequency of pcd measured by the dna breaks through the tunel assay . as shown in fig . the number of cells was higher in _METHOD_ lines compared to . the difference between cells entering pcd became more prominent with time after subculture being and for the _METHOD_ overexpression cultures compared to and for control cultures on the first and fifth day after subculture respectively . altogether our data suggest that in arabidopsis overproduction of _METHOD_ led to the reduction in cell proliferation and an increased level of pcd . because in animals _PROTEIN_ functions closely together with the _PROTEIN_ tumour suppressor gene we searched for the arabidopsis orthologue of _PROTEIN_ and found a gene with identity within the protein coding region . the arabidopsis gene is annotated as nucleoside phosphoramidase and adenylylsulfatase . in agreement the animal _PROTEIN_ is also involved in purine metabolism . _PROTEIN_ is with _PROTEIN_ in animal cells . therefore we tested _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ together with _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in silenced seedlings . as shown in fig . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was reduced in seedlings while in cell culture with _METHOD_ overexpression it was elevated compared to the control . these data indicate that as in animal cells arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ might function together with _PROTEIN_ . in order to analyse further the deregulated cell proliferation we also determined the _PROTEIN_ of cdka and genes by and found both to be upregulated in the plants compared to .
