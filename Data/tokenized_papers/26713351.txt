in both animals and plants messenger rna export has been shown to contribute to immune response regulation . the arabidopsis _LOCATION_ protein _PROTEIN_ along with the nucleoporins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are components of the mrna export machinery and contribute to immunity mediated by nucleotide binding leucine rich repeat immune receptors . the human _PROTEIN_ ortholog is part of a small protein complex with three additional members the rna helicase aly and _PROTEIN_ . we systematically assessed the biological roles of the arabidopsis homologs of these proteins in toll interleukin receptor type nlr mediated immunity using reverse genetics . although mutations in aly and did not result in obvious defects _PROTEIN_ mutation partially suppressed the autoimmune phenotypes of a gain of function tnl mutant _PROTEIN_ . an additive effect on _PROTEIN_ suppression was observed in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutant plants suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have independent functions . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein which fully complemented _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotypes localized to _LOCATION_ similarly to _PROTEIN_ . however it was also targeted to _LOCATION_ granules identified as processing bodies . in addition we observed no change in _PROTEIN_ mrna levels whereas less _PROTEIN_ protein accumulated in _PROTEIN_ mutant suggesting that _PROTEIN_ contributes to _PROTEIN_ homeostasis through posttranscriptional _METHOD_ . in summary this study highlights the importance of posttranscriptional rna processing mediated by _PROTEIN_ in the regulation of tnl mediated immunity .
in human and drosophila spp. the protein interacts with three partners namely _PROTEIN_ and aly . is an rna helicase highly similar to a rna helicase well known for its involvement in mrna export _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is a family of rna binding proteins that includes _PROTEIN_ box binding _PROTEIN_ . beyond their rna binding capacity tafs influence the initiation of transcription . aly is a _LOCATION_ protein with _LOCATION_ acid binding ability . aly has been shown to interfere with silencing in plants . through blast analysis we identified the closest homologs of _PROTEIN_ and aly in arabidopsis . we then obtained homozygous t dna knockout lines for each gene and crossed them with _PROTEIN_ plants to monitor if mutations in these members of the complex could affect _PROTEIN_ signaling similarly as _PROTEIN_ . table direct and indirect interactors and their putative arabidopsis homolog the stunted morphology of _PROTEIN_ was partly suppressed in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant plants . however none of the other double mutants with _PROTEIN_ resulted in _PROTEIN_ suppression . in addition to their stunted morphology _PROTEIN_ plants display increased resistance to virulent oomycete pathogen h. arabidopsidis . to assess if _PROTEIN_ could also suppress this _PROTEIN_ phenotype we performed an infection assay with h. arabidopsidis . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants did not display a statistically significant difference from _PROTEIN_ plants . similarly to _PROTEIN_ the single _PROTEIN_ plant did not display enhanced disease susceptibility when compared with wt plants . in contrast to _PROTEIN_ plants _PROTEIN_ plants did not display impaired mrna export . we also assessed the capacity of _PROTEIN_ to alter the constitutive resistance of _PROTEIN_ to virulent bacterial pathogen p. syringae pv . maculicola . in this case the suppression of the _PROTEIN_ resistance was significant . since _PROTEIN_ immune activation can be monitored by the level of _PROTEIN_ of pr genes we verified if the pr gene _PROTEIN_ level was affected in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants . the quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction data demonstrates that _PROTEIN_ plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transcript at a level approximately times higher than observed in unstressed wt plants . in the double mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ level was approximately half the level observed in _PROTEIN_ at fold of the wt plants . for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ similar fold changes were observed . fig . partially suppresses the autoimmunity of _PROTEIN_ . a morphology of week old soil grown wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants . b two week old soil grown plants were inoculated with hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis at a concentration of conidiospores per milliliter and the number of conidiospores was quantified days after inoculation . bars represent the mean of four replicates . statistical significance was established using student t test and statistically different results are represented by different letters . c five week old soil grown plants were inoculated with pseudomonas syringae pv . maculicola at an optical density at nm and statistical significance was evaluated using student s t test d _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ was quantified using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and was normalized with _PROTEIN_ . in conclusion among all complex component mutants tested _PROTEIN_ is the only mutant that affects the _PROTEIN_ autoimmune phenotypes acting as a partial suppressor of _PROTEIN_ . since arabidopsis contains another _PROTEIN_ homolog _PROTEIN_ we investigated whether it was redundant to _PROTEIN_ . in order to assess whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were functionally redundant we compared the morphology of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ t dna knock out lines to that of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . the _PROTEIN_ plants are indistinguishable from wt whereas the _PROTEIN_ mutant is slightly different from wt with slightly bigger and rounder leaves often concave rather than convex indicating that in arabidopsis the _PROTEIN_ protein can not functionally complement _PROTEIN_ morphological phenotypes . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant resembles the _PROTEIN_ single mutant . to further substantiate the difference between _PROTEIN_ and wt plants and between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we evaluated the number of rosette leaves when the plants were weeks old as the _PROTEIN_ mutant exhibits a _PROTEIN_ flowering phenotype . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant plants exhibit similar flowering time defects confirming that these two genes do not have redundant functions . furthermore the phylogenetic tree generated using the full length amino acid sequences of and homologs found in different plant species also shows that and form different clades in all species . fig . and _PROTEIN_ have different topology and are functionally distinct . a morphology of week old soil grown wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants . b comparing flowering time in soil grown wt _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . letters indicate statistical significance as determined by student s t test . c phylogeny of _PROTEIN_ related proteins was inferred using the full length amino acid sequences . alignment and tree was computed using clustalw and a neighbor joining alignment was used . d protein domain organization was inferred using the national center for biotechnology information conserved domain database software . small numbers above the proteins indicate the relative position of the domains the numbers at the end of the protein names indicate the number of amino acids . while _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have similarity in composition of their functional domains their protein architecture is different . _PROTEIN_ possesses a rna recognition motif at its amino terminus followed by a two zinc finger domain whereas in _PROTEIN_ only one zinc finger is present . the human _PROTEIN_ protein has the protein topology of while _PROTEIN_ shares the protein topology of . for further analysis we therefore refer to as the homolog of _PROTEIN_ rather than that of human . with publicly available microarray data we asked whether _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ was inducible by virulent bacterial pathogen pseudomonas syringae avirulent oomycete pathogen h. arabidopsidis virulent oomycete pathogen h. arabidopsidis and _PROTEIN_ elicitor . the _PROTEIN_ of these genes was not significantly modulated in the assessed conditions . in order to assess if _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutations would impair the immune capacity of other nlr proteins we evaluated the response of these mutants against the avirulent bacterial pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv . tomato p. syringae pv . tomato and the avirulent oomycete strain h. arabidopsidis . we also evaluated _PROTEIN_ using the type iii secretion deficient bacterial strain p. syringae pv . tomato . response to the avirulent pathogens tested or p. syringae pv . tomato was not affected in either single mutants or the double mutant indicating that neither _PROTEIN_ nor _PROTEIN_ is a component involved in general nlr signaling . we also assessed the reactive oxygen species induction capacity in wt _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants in response to . interestingly we observed mild yet reproducible reduction in ros induction by in the _PROTEIN_ single mutant and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . based on the phylogeny and protein topology we conclude that the closest homolog of in humans is _PROTEIN_ . in addition based on our epistatic analysis we conclude that and do not have overlapping functions in plants . finally neither _PROTEIN_ nor _PROTEIN_ appears to be involved in general nlr signaling . however they do contribute to the ros induction in _PROTEIN_ . since _PROTEIN_ like _PROTEIN_ could partially suppress the _PROTEIN_ phenotype we sought to investigate if the lack of these two proteins would have an additive effect on the suppression of the _PROTEIN_ autoimmune phenotypes . while both double mutants were only partial _PROTEIN_ suppressors the triple mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ almost fully suppressed the stunted morphology of _PROTEIN_ . however the triple mutant plants had delayed bolting when compared with wt plants . since _PROTEIN_ dwarf morphology was fully suppressed in the triple mutant we verified whether pr gene _PROTEIN_ was comparable to levels observed in wt . indeed we observed that the pr gene _PROTEIN_ in the triple mutant was very close to that observed in wt plants . fig . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutant analysis . a morphology of wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants . soil grown plants were photographed weeks after germination . b _PROTEIN_ of defense marker genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the indicated genotypes . quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was performed on week old plants grown on murashige skoog plates . _PROTEIN_ was used to normalize the transcript levels . each average represents three technical repeats . c growth of hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis days after inoculation on the indicated genotypes . spray infection was performed on week old plants on soil with a conidiospore suspension at spores per milliliter . each average represents four sampling repeats . letters indicate statistical significance as determined by student s t test . the experiment was repeated three times with similar results . since the morphology suppression and pr gene _PROTEIN_ suppression of the autoimmune mutant was nearly complete we assessed the resistance of the triple mutant plants to the virulent biotrophic oomycete h. arabidopsidis . the triple mutant analysis showed an additive effect of the _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ mutations in the suppression of _PROTEIN_ resistance to h. arabidopsidis . the additive effect of the _PROTEIN_ mutant on the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant both at the morphological level in the resistance to pathogens and the absence of mrna export defect in _PROTEIN_ suggests that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins do not have a role in the same pathway . to further assess whether _PROTEIN_ could associate with _PROTEIN_ in planta as does with _PROTEIN_ we generated a stable epitope tagged transgenic line _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of its own regulatory sequence in _PROTEIN_ background . this construct fully complements the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ phenotype suggesting that the c terminal _PROTEIN_ tag does not affect the function of _PROTEIN_ . we then crossed this line with _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to generate plants heterozygous at both loci that could be used for coimmunoprecipitation . in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ we could not immunoprecipitate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . this result combined with the additive effect of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the triple mutant suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ either do not physically interact in plants and are not involved in the same biological function or their interaction is too weak or transient to be detectable . additionally we queried the plant interactome database to search for other proteins that could interact with _PROTEIN_ . this database reported that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ all interact with _PROTEIN_ but not with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . fig . does not associate with _PROTEIN_ in vivo . a

immunoprecipitation of _PROTEIN_ using anti green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ antibody . total protein extracts from seedlings grown on murashige skoog plates were subjected to immunoprecipitation by anti _METHOD_ agarose beads . input and eluted samples were detected by anti _PROTEIN_ and anti _METHOD_ antibodies . _PROTEIN_ encodes a glycine rich protein of kda . it contains a zinc finger domain a rna recognition motif and is predicted to be _LOCATION_ localized by the wolf psort prediction tool . since _PROTEIN_ proteins have not been well characterized in plants we further investigated the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ . when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the control of its native promoter was transformed in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant the transformed plants displayed _PROTEIN_ like morphology indicating that _PROTEIN_ was properly _PROTEIN_ and the fusion gene is able to complement the _PROTEIN_ defects . although _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ could be observed in the _LOCATION_ strong _METHOD_ was also observed as clear punctate spots in the _LOCATION_ reminiscent of proteins localized to p bodies . to assess if these could be p bodies we used a stable arabidopsis transgenic line _PROTEIN_ the cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ labeled p bodies marker _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . similar punctate spots as observed in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants were observed . to further confirm that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was indeed localized to p bodies we crossed the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line and examined plants . a clear _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ colocalization was observed indicating that _PROTEIN_ localizes to the p bodies . fig . localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . a morphology of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and two _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_

the p bodies transected by the solid white line in panel k. p bodies are known to be involved in the sequestration of mrnas nmd au rich element mediated mrna decay and microrna induced mrna silencing . all these components of rna regulation and catabolism may affect transcription and translation of specific mrnas . in addition plant nlr proteins are known to be regulated by transacting small interfering rnas . thus we examined whether the level of _PROTEIN_ transcript or the level of _PROTEIN_ protein was affected in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ relative to wt and _PROTEIN_ plants . we did not observe significant differences in mrna levels between wt and _PROTEIN_ and between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we then tested whether _PROTEIN_ protein accumulation is affected by _PROTEIN_ through western blot assay using an anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . we consistently observed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein level in _PROTEIN_ compared with wt and this difference in _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ compared with _PROTEIN_ . as the _PROTEIN_ transcription is not substantially affected by _PROTEIN_ we conclude that _PROTEIN_ affects _PROTEIN_ protein accumulation through posttranscriptional _METHOD_ . fig . does not affect _PROTEIN_ transcript but does reduce _PROTEIN_ protein level . a quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify the _PROTEIN_ transcript levels in various genotypes . b western blot using anti _PROTEIN_ antibody to quantify the _PROTEIN_ protein levels in wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the experiment was repeated four times . the same plants were used for experiments in a and b . leaf tissue was collected from week old soil grown plants . c quantification of _PROTEIN_ band intensity relative to a nonspecific band in ponceau s in four western blot repeats as described in b as determined by using image j . bars represent mean standard deviation of relative _PROTEIN_ protein abundance . _PROTEIN_ protein abundance in wt or _PROTEIN_ was set as . student s t tests were used to calculate the statistical significance between genotypes as indicated by different letters . given the localization displayed by _PROTEIN_ and the apparent lack of a direct effect on _PROTEIN_ mrna level the suppression of the _PROTEIN_ phenotype is likely indirect . putative targets could be regulated by mirna and affect tnl mediated immunity . to test this hypothesis we assessed the level of known mirnas in our genetic backgrounds . northern blot analysis showed slight differences for some mirna however when multiple repeats were performed those differences were not found to be statistically significant . therefore we conclude that the effect of _PROTEIN_ on _PROTEIN_ immunity is not via an obvious alteration of mirna levels . fig . does alter the level of some micro rnas . the _PROTEIN_ level of five mirnas _PROTEIN_ was assessed and quantified by northern blot for plant genotypes wt _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . loading control was normalized by rna . rna was extracted from the leaves of week old plants .
protein topology was searched using the national center for biotechnology information conserved domain search tool . the phylogenetic tree was made using colbalt protein alignment software set to infer the tree using a neighbor joining method from the full length amino acid sequences . the species and protein models used to infer the tree are for _PROTEIN_ proteins arabidopsis thaliana _GENE_ glycine max arabidopsis lyrata medicago truncatula vitis vinifera and for taf arabidopsis thaliana _GENE_ arabidopsis lyrata oryza sativa brachypodium distachyon glycine max vitis vinifera and populus trichocarpa . the human protein _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ used to infer the topologies were _PROTEIN_ and respectively . plants were grown at under h light and h dark regime . to create _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ constructs a genomic pcr fragment of with bp upstream from the start codon was cloned into the modified binary vector with either c terminal _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ sequence by restriction enzymes bamhi and sali . the cloning pcr was performed using primers cgcggatcccatttctccagagctatggc and acgcacgcgtcgacatatggacgagaccggtttc . agrobacterium mediated plant transformation was carried out with slight modification to the procedure described by clough and bent . briefly the silwet l was substituted with ofx and floral dip was performed twice with a week interval between dippings . to identify homozygous _PROTEIN_ t dna or mutants we used primers caaaacaatccaccaccattc and aaaaagtcaagcagtgcgatg to perform pcr . similarly to check homozygosity for the _PROTEIN_ mutation primers cggccgataattcgtggacg and caccagtagatagccctcc were used . for presence of the t dna from the generic primers _PROTEIN_ was used for salk lines and sail f for sail lines . rt pcr analysis of the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was carried out as previously described . _PROTEIN_ was used as loading control . leaf infiltration of pseudomonas syringae strains was performed on week old plants as described previously . spray infection by h. arabidopsidis or was performed as described previously . ten day old plants grown on murashige skoog _METHOD_ were used for observation with _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ tagged constructs using a leica confocal microscope . in situ poly a rna hybridization was performed as previously described . plants from a cross between plants homozygous for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in were used to check the association between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in vivo while plants homozygous for _PROTEIN_ in were used as the negative control . plants were grown on _METHOD_ medium and g of week old plants were harvested from each genotype . _LOCATION_ extraction was performed as previously described . _LOCATION_ were sonicated using a sonic dismembrator at a power of for min with a s pause for each s of operation to break the _LOCATION_ envelope . _LOCATION_ samples were incubated with nhs activated sepharose beads for min to remove nonspecific binding . _LOCATION_ were pelleted at g for s and were allowed to be incubated with recombinant camel _METHOD_ binding protein conjugated beads for h. after incubation the beads were pelleted at g for min and were washed three times with ne . subsequent western blot was performed using anti _METHOD_ and anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies respectively . eight leaf discs of week old arabidopsis plants were sampled using a razor blade and were floated overnight under light on sterile water . _PROTEIN_ induced ros produced by the leaf discs were measured by a luminol based assay . luminescence was captured using a tecan plate reader .
