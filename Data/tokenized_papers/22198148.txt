since the first ultrastructural investigations of sieve tubes in the early their structure has been a matter of debate . because sieve tube structure defines frictional interactions in the tube system the presence of p protein obstructions shown in many transmission electron micrographs led to a discussion about the mode of phloem transport . at present it is generally agreed that p protein agglomerations are preparation artifacts due to injury the lumen of sieve tubes is free of obstructions and phloem flow is driven by an osmotically generated pressure differential according to s classical hypothesis . here we show that the phloem contains a distinctive network of protein filaments . stable transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis thaliana sieve element occlusion _PROTEIN_ yellow _METHOD_ protein fusions show that at _PROTEIN_ meshworks at the margins and clots in the lumen are a general feature of living sieve tubes . live imaging of phloem flow and flow velocity measurements in individual tubes indicate that at _PROTEIN_ agglomerations do not markedly affect or alter flow . a transmission electron microscopy preparation protocol has been generated showing sieve tube ultrastructure of unprecedented quality . a reconstruction of sieve tube ultrastructure served as basis for tube resistance calculations . the impact of agglomerations on phloem flow is discussed .
because electron microscopy samples are under high vacuum samples have to be fixed and dehydrated . since the structure of proteins _LOCATION_ and other cellular components is often defined by their interaction with water molecules dehydration may lead to artifacts . the degree of artifacts varies with cell and protein type . to draw appropriate conclusions an in vivo reference is most helpful . unfortunately such a reference is lacking for sieve tubes . sieve tube components are usually invisible in the light microscope because of their size and/or lack of contrast . in addition it would be important that sieve tubes be observed without preparation which is unfortunately usually impossible because of the anatomy of the plant . so far not a single study has shown cellular features of the phloem without preparation of the tissue . even the method that allowed us to investigate individual uninjured sieve elements in broad bean at high resolution requires removal of cortical cell layers . our aim for this study however was to investigate sieve tubes without any mechanical intervention . in aboveground organs in addition to being embedded in a _PROTEIN_ layer of ground tissue the phloem is covered by more or less opaque pigmented cells making a direct observation impossible . the cells in roots of many plant species however are relatively transparent . to study the phloem a thin cortical layer is beneficial since cell wall cytoplasm interfaces lead to reflection and refraction phenomena . in this _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis thaliana appears ideal . the cortical layer in primary roots is just three cell layers _PROTEIN_ and the root cells do not contain significant amounts of polyphenolics and other compounds that would significantly affect optical properties . the small size of arabidopsis sieve tubes is a drawback but with high end instrumentation subcellular structures can be visualized . we expected that the forisome homolog gene _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis encodes a specific p protein . we cloned the gene including its endogenous promoter fused yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ to its c terminus and generated transgenic arabidopsis lines . to study roots in vivo we used microscopy rhizosphere chambers and grew arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ for structural studies . the chambers consist of plant pots with a cover glass as one of the side walls optimized for high resolution . root growth is funneled along the cover glass by a porous mesh while root hairs are in direct contact with soil . in contrast with glass bottom petri dishes where plants are grown in an artificial medium under sterile conditions and at humidity micro rocs allow direct visualization of the root system in a natural soil environment which also includes symbionts . maximum resolution without any preparation or manipulation of the tissue is possible . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was first detectable in the differentiation zone of young roots . after elongation spherical amorphous protein agglomerates were found inside the cells . time lapse movies revealed quick movements of the bodies in actively growing root regions . in the course of further development the protein bodies increased in size and became elongated . an early indication of branch root development is the appearance of additional small protein bodies beneath the sieve tube . the bodies increase in size until the branch root breaks through the cortical layer and branch root sieve tubes are formed . at certain locations a sudden and significant alteration in the shape of the protein bodies can be observed . the oval amorphous bodies condense and transform into defined filamentous structures . both amorphous bodies and filamentous structures are usually aligned in files . to study subcellular localization we investigated living root sieve tubes by confocal microscopy . besides the prominent amorphous bodies fine strands became visible . to identify the cell type in which the fine strands occur we generated a double transgenic line _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged to the _LOCATION_ under control of the medicago truncatula _PROTEIN_ promoter . this promoter is known to be sieve element specific which allows the unequivocal distinction of sieve elements and companion cells . filaments are restricted to sieve elements while amorphous protein may occur outside a file probably in young developing tubes . to determine the location of actively translocating sieve tubes we loaded leaves of transgenic arabidopsis plants grown in micro rocs with _PROTEIN_ diacetate and observed transport in uninjured roots . translocation occurred in cells containing filamentous proteins . in older roots _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ filaments became more prominent . amorphous protein bodies are located in neighboring and nontranslocating cell files supporting the notion that these are young developing sieve elements and that sieve tubes become active after the proteins transform into filaments . at highest resolution a meshwork becomes visible that usually extends throughout the sieve element . the meshwork and _LOCATION_ cover a significant fraction of the sieve tube _LOCATION_ and are closely associated . at the sieve plate the meshwork traverses the sieve plate pores outlining their location . we reinvestigated the literature and our own vast collection of sieve tube micrographs but failed to find any structures in electron micrographs of arabidopsis and other species that resembled the meshworks found in our confocal images of mature translocating tubes . we therefore decided to reinvestigate sieve tube ultrastructure . the formation of artifacts in sieve tubes due to preparation and fixation for electron microscopy has been discussed in numerous publications . a large number of fixation protocols including chemical and freeze fixation of plant and callus sieve tubes has been tested . a crucial step however is the preparation before fixation . since electron microscopy generally requires small samples the tissue is usually sectioned . this procedure induces artifacts before fixation is even initiated . therefore we decided to fix entire plants to prevent prefixation artifacts . chemical fixation may be suboptimal because of the slow diffusion of the fixative through multiple tissue layers . ultrafast freezing procedures require vitrification of the tissue otherwise water crystal formation leads to complete distortion of cellular features . although high pressure freezing provides superior vitrification to a depth of up to and represents the optimum procedure for tissue cryofixation the maximum sample size is an area of mm too small for any plant . other freezing techniques such as jet freezing or plunge freezing usually vitrify the outer to of the tissue at best . even in very small plants such as arabidopsis the phloem is never closer than to the surface . however the phloem has one major advantage over other tissues . it carries a high concentration of an intrinsic cryoprotectant suc . standard fixation of arabidopsis leaf and stem segments after excision leads to the typical precipitation of p proteins on the sieve plate which has been seen before in many other plant species . often the pores are filled with protein filaments and lined with a _PROTEIN_ layer of callose . we compared chemical fixation of excised tissue with chemical fixation of whole young plants . p proteins in uncut sieve tubes were more evenly distributed throughout the lumen and the organelles were usually intact . the appearance resembled tubes after gentle preparation . however no structure could be found that matched the strands observed by confocal microscopy in living tubes . we then took young arabidopsis plants in the four to eight leaf state and plunge froze them in slush nitrogen . subsequently the tissue was freeze substituted in aldehyde fixative containing acetone and postfixed in osmium tetroxide . initially preservation was poor and it turned out that plants had to be grown at humidity either in soil or on petri dishes to achieve appropriate preservation . such growth conditions prevented the formation of a _PROTEIN_ cuticle that obviously represents a significant freezing barrier . in some cases it is beneficial to add to water to the glutaraldehyde containing acetone fixative . the water supports preservation and easier sectioning of the tissue . in plunge frozen and freeze substituted tissue parenchyma cells surrounding the sieve elements and companion cells are severely damaged and no subcellular structures are preserved . however unprecedented preservation is achieved in sieve elements and companion cells of source leaves . sieve element _LOCATION_ and mitochondria are intact . most importantly protein filaments nm in diameter and often forming bundles are located at the margin of the cells while the fine filaments in the lumen usually found after chemical fixation are absent . in accordance with confocal images filament bundles are preferentially oriented longitudinally to the sieve tube axis . bundles may consist of < to > individual filaments . tangential and longitudinal sections suggest that the filaments are relatively flexible may bend backward and often are not strictly aligned in parallel . sieve plate pores are often unobstructed and there is no indication of callose deposition around the pores . in accordance with investigations after chemical fixation the _LOCATION_ is organized in stacks . sieve element _LOCATION_ have a smooth surface and are not in close contact with other structures or organelles . by contrast mitochondria are always embedded in a parietal layer and they are always surrounded by a halo of nm to which other structures such as protein filaments or _LOCATION_ are attached . in addition it appears that there is an amorphous ground _PROTEIN_ of the parietal layer embedding all other structures . the nature of this _PROTEIN_ is obscure . in some cases it looks as though _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ disintegrate or transform into this amorphous structure . the layer however could also consist of parietal proteins found in other plant species . in addition to mitochondria smaller electron dense vesicles can frequently be found in the parietal ground _PROTEIN_ which seem to bud off of _LOCATION_ structures . the nature of the _LOCATION_ is yet unclear . they may be constituents of the _LOCATION_ but they often appear more electron dense and significantly better preserved than the _LOCATION_ suggesting a different molecular composition . to verify that the filaments and bundles are formed by _PROTEIN_ we investigated the arabidopsis t dna insertion mutant gabi kat . the t dna insertion is located in the first exon . pcr experiments verified that the protein is effectively knocked out but truncated mrnas are formed . plantpromoterdb predicted a possible weak promoter in the second intron which might lead to the formation of the observed truncated mrnas . however the mutant did not show antigenicity to the p protein specific antibody _PROTEIN_ while the phloem in wild type plants was well labeled . the neighboring gene _GENE_ which shows high homology to _GENE_ was not affected by the t dna insertion . tem images confirmed the absence of _PROTEIN_ filaments while all other structures found in wild type plants were present . complementation by transformation of the mutant with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ led to recovery of filament generation in the mutant . the complemented line showed reduced _METHOD_ compared with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line however bundles of filaments resembling those of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants could clearly be visualized . frequently we noticed in confocal images that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ agglomerates filling significant portions of the tube diameter at or close to the sieve plate . the appearance of these agglomerates is extremely variable . some sieve tubes may contain large bundles while others have agglomerates on both sides of the sieve plate and filaments spanning through the pores . in many cases however multiple large agglomerations fill the entire lumen of the tube . we loaded the phloem with cfda and surprisingly independent of the amount of protein in the tube lumen all sieve tubes were fully functional . the structural state of the protein filling the lumen is different in mature and young sieve tubes . developing sieve tubes contain amorphous protein bodies while the agglomerations in mature sieve tubes consist _PROTEIN_ of filaments and bundles indicated by their extensions . despite the large amount of protein within the flow path the tube contains cfda . the lower tube is still in development with isolated sieve elements and a sieve element in the transition phase . since cfda is loaded in leaves and diffuses into source tissue until it reaches the phloem no distinct front but a gradual increase in _METHOD_ results in the transport phloem . the problem becomes especially obvious when neighboring companion and parenchyma cells light up almost as fast as the sieve tubes . since the quality and speed of loading is dependent on multiple _PROTEIN_ it has not yet been possible to standardize the procedure to always obtain the same loading . therefore we were not yet able to exclude the possibility that sieve tubes containing large agglomerations did not actually translocate but that the _METHOD_ diffused from neighboring tubes . to unequivocally prove that the tubes are actively translocating we conducted studies on real time movement of _METHOD_ dyes within individual sieve tubes . we grew plants in micro rocs loaded them with cfda and photobleached cfda in the tube to produce a distinct front of _METHOD_ and imaged refilling at s intervals _METHOD_ . since the laser of a confocal microscope can be directed with pixel size accuracy precise areas can be targeted . figure shows three frames of a frap experiment of the tube shown in figures and . refilling occurs at a velocity of downstream of the obstruction . there is no other sieve tube or _PROTEIN_ sieve plate that would allow bypassing the agglomeration . we therefore conclude that transport occurs through agglomerations . currently phloem translocation is thought to be driven by an osmotically generated pressure differential . sieve tubes supposedly provide a channel of adequately low hydraulic resistance permitting pressure differential driven flow . the presence of agglomerations in the flow path necessitated a reevaluation of the feasibility of a pressure flow . to calculate the increase of resistance by obstructions the resolution of confocal microscopy is insufficient . only tem permits precise measurements . tem sections on the other hand are only in the range of nm _PROTEIN_ and the agglomerations are rare in comparison to unobstructed areas . to section through a single sieve element of length individual cross sections are required and on average only every tenth sieve element contains an agglomeration . by conducting serial cross sectioning we were able to find two sieve plates and one area of obstruction . at the sieve plate numerous filaments are located that traverse the pores . right behind the sieve plate of the lumen is obstructed by filaments . with increasing distance the filaments are located further toward the margins until they form distinct bundles . sieve plates in arabidopsis are often not strictly perpendicular to the tube axis . the sieve plate in figure also contains filaments on the plate . while some pores are open others contain several filaments that obstruct a certain percentage of the pore s lumen . the only agglomeration we found so far is shown in figure . the distance between image figure and is . major parts of the lumen are filled with filaments with the exception of an area of . average filament diameter is nm with nm spacing between filaments within the agglomeration . to see if the abundance of filaments and bundles is a general feature of dicot sieve tubes we investigated two nonrelated plant species . while arabidopsis has developed into an important model plant ultrastructural studies are very limited . we chose tobacco since extensive ultrastructural data are available and black cottonwood as model tree species . preservation of some ultrastructural features was not as good as in arabidopsis and modification of the fixation protocol will be required in the future . however filaments and bundles can be seen in the periphery of sieve elements . in contrast with arabidopsis sieve element _LOCATION_ of tobacco are decorated with filaments . the size of the filaments differed slightly from that of arabidopsis with an average of nm in tobacco and nm in black cottonwood . the structures found in whole plant freeze substitutions differ significantly from what has been described using other preparation and fixation protocols . the large amount of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ filaments in the translocation path inevitably leads to the question of its impact on tube resistance . the question is can a pressure flow as discussed by citation drive phloem translocation ? figure shows a schematic summary of our findings in arabidopsis sieve tubes . in recent phloem flow calculation models sieve tubes were expected to be empty tubes and the space occupied by organelles and other structures is considered to be below the _LOCATION_ of sieve tube geometry measurements . in reality however even in areas without significant _PROTEIN_ accumulation a major fraction of the tube lumen turned out to be unavailable for translocation . usually up to are occupied by sieve tube constituents . even in the wider tubes of tobacco up to of the lumen is filled with sieve element _LOCATION_ and other organelles . on top of this _PROTEIN_ agglomerations need to be included in the calculations . to quantify the effects of the organelles and _PROTEIN_ filaments on the flow we calculate the influence of these on the hydrostatic pressure difference between source and sink tissues required to drive the observed flow . for simplicity we consider a single sieve tube as a proxy for the phloem and model the translocation pathway as consisting of a collection of approximately cylindrical sieve tube elements lying end to end separated by sieve plates . this approach has been widely used in previous studies of phloem transport . the relation between the hydrostatic pressure drop between source and sink and the volumetric flow rate q through the sieve tube is the hydraulic equivalent of ohm s law here the volumetric flow rate q ua is the product of the flow velocity u and cross section area a of the sieve element and r is the hydraulic resistance of the phloem translocation pathway . due to the abundance of sieve tube constituents at the margins we estimate that between and of the area is open to flow such that the cross section area a lies in the range a . typical flow speeds observed are of the order u which yields q . when calculating the resistance r in equation we take into account three major components the tube lumen including organelles the sieve plate and the _PROTEIN_ agglomerations . assuming that the translocation pathway consists of n identical sieve tube elements of which contain a _PROTEIN_ agglomeration we write the resistance of the phloem translocation pathway r as here rlumen is the resistance of a single sieve tube element lumen rplate is the resistance of a single sieve plate separating adjacent sieve elements and rplug is the resistance of a single _PROTEIN_ agglomeration . please refer to the supplemental appendix online for a detailed discussion of how these resistance values are determined and table for a list of characteristic values of the parameters used . as shown in table we find typical values of the _METHOD_ in equation while the contribution from the lumen and plate resistances are of comparable magnitude the contribution from the _PROTEIN_ agglomerations is somewhat smaller reflecting the _PROTEIN_ that these are only found in every sieve tube elements . we finally have for the total resistance in equation that and find from equation that the pressure drop required to drive the flow over a distance of cm lies in the range _PROTEIN_ . list of parameters for flow calculations parameters relevant for the calculation of the pressure drop in equation since _PROTEIN_ is located in the flow path of sieve tubes we tested a potential influence on translocation . we used the homozygous _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion mutant and conducted flow velocity studies along intact roots . we studied the flow in eight independent plants of each wild type and t dna insertion mutant . velocities in the root system are variable in both lines . so far no significant difference between insertion mutant and the wild type has been found . we further measured the average sieve tube diameter of the two lines to see if fewer obstructions lead to a change in tube anatomy . average sieve tube diameters did not differ significantly between the lines . our study was initiated because the genomic _PROTEIN_ sequence in arabidopsis showed homology to genomic sequences of medicago forisomes and therefore was likely to be a yet unknown p protein . this relationship also suggested a similar function . forisomes appear to form reversible agglomerations that temporarily stop sieve tube flow . the transformation from the low volume to the high volume state of a forisome may be completed in _METHOD_ . thus we tested _PROTEIN_ for a potential injury reaction . initially we observed intact sieve tubes for several hours by _METHOD_ and confocal microscopy without any indication of dynamic behavior of _PROTEIN_ bundles and agglomerations . then we tested different injury stimuli that are known to trigger the forisome reaction such as local mechanical injury distant burning of leaf tips and local cold shocks . none of the treatments triggered any immediate reaction . even direct application of to mm medium on ruptured sieve tubes or isolated _PROTEIN_ bundles did not result in any structural changes . although we were not able to find reactions equivalent to that of forisomes _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis sieve tubes underwent an obvious structural alteration after tissue excision and standard fixation for tem . to understand the development of these structures we conducted time lapse movies of injured sieve tubes . a very slow movement of _PROTEIN_ toward the sieve plate was observed in some cases . surprisingly the movement did not stop at the sieve plate but agglomerates continued to move through the plate for extended periods of time .
