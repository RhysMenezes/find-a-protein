nucleotide de novo synthesis is highly conserved among _METHOD_ and represents an essential biochemical pathway . in plants the two initial enzymatic reactions of de novo pyrimidine synthesis occur in the _LOCATION_ . by use of green _METHOD_ protein fusions clear support is provided for a localization of the remaining reactions in the _LOCATION_ and mitochondria . this implies that _PROTEIN_ aspartate an intermediate of this pathway must be exported and precursors of pyrimidine salvage are imported into _LOCATION_ . a corresponding uracil transport activity could be measured in intact _LOCATION_ isolated from cauliflower buds . pluto _LOCATION_ was identified as a member of the nucleobase cation protein family from arabidopsis thaliana capable of transporting purine and pyrimidine nucleobases . a pluto green _METHOD_ protein fusion was shown to reside in the _LOCATION_ envelope after _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts . heterologous _PROTEIN_ of pluto in an escherichia coli mutant lacking the bacterial uracil permease uraa allowed a detailed biochemical characterization . pluto transports uracil adenine and guanine with apparent affinities of and respectively . transport was markedly inhibited by low concentrations of a proton uncoupler indicating that pluto functions as a proton substrate symporter . thus a protein for the absolutely required import of pyrimidine nucleobases into _LOCATION_ was identified .
the initial aim of this work was to identify a uracil import system in _LOCATION_ . from the recently published work it became obvious that such an import system must exist because subsequent enzymatic steps in nucleoside salvage and catabolism are distributed between _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . to obtain experimental evidence for the capacity of _LOCATION_ to import uracil cauliflower buds were chosen as source tissue for _LOCATION_ isolation . heterotrophic _LOCATION_ from cauliflower can be isolated with high purity and intactness and were shown to be capable of transporting various metabolites such as triose and hexose phosphates and _PROTEIN_ . uptake of uracil into isolated _LOCATION_ was determined by the silicone oil technique . import of uracil was linear with time for at least min and accounted for nmol protein . the concentration dependent uptake of uracil into _LOCATION_ followed michaelis menten kinetics and revealed an apparent affinity of . the activity of the salvage pathway enzyme uracil phosphoribosyltransferase was also radiometrically assayed in isolated cauliflower _LOCATION_ and accounted for protein . yeast cells import uracil via the nucleobase permease _PROTEIN_ to support pyrimidine nucleotide salvage . _PROTEIN_ belongs to the nucleobase cation _PROTEIN_ family of transport proteins also known as purine related transporters . the closest arabidopsis homolog to this protein is encoded by _GENE_ . the deduced amino acid sequence exhibits identity and similarity to _PROTEIN_ . the n terminus of the _GENE_ translation product contains a predicted target sequence for chloroplasts . therefore this protein represented a good candidate for a _LOCATION_ uracil importer and was named pluto _LOCATION_ . pluto encodes a protein of amino acids in length with a calculated molecular _METHOD_ of kd . furthermore pluto is a highly hydrophobic _LOCATION_ protein with predicted transmembrane helical spanners which is typical for _PROTEIN_ family members . the first structure of a _PROTEIN_ family member was solved from microbacterium liquefaciens in that work highly conserved amino acid residues were identified in _PROTEIN_ members from bacteria and fungi . thirty of these residues are also conserved in pluto . pluto _PROTEIN_ was induced in escherichia coli mutants lacking the bacterial endogenous uracil permease uraa obtained from the national institute of genetics shizuoka japan . after induction of pluto _PROTEIN_ e. coli cells showed uptake of uracil in a time dependent manner . uracil uptake was linear for at least min and then accounted for protein whereas noninduced cells imported only protein . the apparent affinity of pluto for uracil was . a detailed analysis of the substrate specificity was performed by direct uptake studies of the nucleobases adenine and guanine . time dependent uptake studies with adenine showed clearly increasing uptake upon induction whereas uptake into noninduced e. coli cells remained low . after min induced cells imported adenine protein and controls only adenine protein uptake was linear for min . similar results were obtained for guanine uptake . after min induced cells imported guanine protein and controls only guanine protein . the apparent affinities for adenine and guanine uptake calculated by subtracting the uptake rates of noninduced cells in substrate dependent import studies were as follows for adenine and for guanine . to check whether nucleosides are also substrates of pluto these were tested in corresponding uptake studies . however when radiolabeled uridine was supplied to e. coli cells and cellular extracts were subsequently run on thin layer chromatography a fast cleavage to the corresponding nucleobases was observed . cleavage is assumed to occur in the periplasmic space of the bacterial cells by corresponding enzyme activities as shown for adenosine . therefore the question whether nucleosides are also substrates of pluto can not be addressed with this experimental system . some of the characterized _PROTEIN_ proteins function as nucleobase sodium symporters . to test whether this also holds true for pluto uracil uptake was measured in the presence of or mm sodium in the uptake medium . however no effect of sodium upon uracil transport was observed compared with controls without addition of cations or mm licl . instead the protonophore m chlorophenylhydrazone inhibited uracil transport almost completely at relatively low concentrations of . the addition of cccp resulted in lower uptake activity and cccp reduced uracil uptake to compared with untreated samples . most likely pluto functions as a nucleobase proton symporter . to check for the subcellular localization of pluto green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ was translationally fused to the c terminal end of pluto . transient _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts revealed a clear _LOCATION_ localization of pluto _METHOD_ . in single confocal slices the red _METHOD_ of chlorophyll is surrounded by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ indicating a labeling of the _LOCATION_ envelope . a _METHOD_ fusion of the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ transporter _PROTEIN_ showed a similar distribution of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . by contrast an n terminal truncated pluto _METHOD_ construct no longer colocalized with _LOCATION_ but was found in internal structures resembling a network . a similar truncated pluto construct without _METHOD_ was tested for uracil transport capacity . however no transport activity could be detected . particle bombardment of onion epidermal peels with pluto _METHOD_ showed results in line with those observed in arabidopsis protoplasts only _LOCATION_ showed _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . monitoring pluto _PROTEIN_ by quantitative rt pcr on cdna from different arabidopsis tissues revealed a medium transcript level in most tissues with up to times higher levels in _METHOD_ and seeds compared with the control gene . on a developmental scale higher pluto _PROTEIN_ was observed in to d old seedlings compared with week old plants . these results are in good agreement with microarray data . interestingly a threefold upregulation of pluto _PROTEIN_ was observed in _PROTEIN_ knockout mutants defective in uracil catabolism . to address the question about a possible function of pluto within nucleotide metabolism a closer look at the corresponding processes in _LOCATION_ was necessary . in the case of pyrimidine de novo synthesis it is not clear which enzymatic steps are located in _LOCATION_ . to clarify this situation the enzymes facilitating the second _PROTEIN_ third _PROTEIN_ fourth and fifth enzymatic steps in pyrimidine de novo synthesis were synthesized as _METHOD_ fusion proteins in arabidopsis protoplasts . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and umpsase _METHOD_ fusion proteins clearly located to the _LOCATION_ whereas dhodh _METHOD_ was associated with mitochondria . based on these results a model describing the subcellular organization of pyrimidine metabolism in arabidopsis was developed .
