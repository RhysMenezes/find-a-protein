plant methyl dna binding proteins discovered by sequence homology to their animal counterparts have not been well characterized at the physiological and functional levels . in order better to characterize the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ protein unique in bearing three mbd domains we used a yeast two hybrid system to identify its partners . one of the interacting proteins we cloned is the arabidopsis arginine methyltransferase _PROTEIN_ . glutathione s transferase pull down and co immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that the two proteins interact with each other and can be co isolated . using _METHOD_ _METHOD_ we show that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are present in the _LOCATION_ . further analyses revealed that _PROTEIN_ acts as an arginine methyltransferase active on both histones and proteins of cellular extracts . the analysis of a t dna mutant line lacking _PROTEIN_ mrna revealed reduced levels of proteins with asymmetrically dimethylated arginines suggesting that _PROTEIN_ which is highly similar to mammalian is indeed a type i arginine methyltransferase . further _PROTEIN_ is a substrate for _PROTEIN_ which post translationally modifies the portion of the protein containing c terminal methylated dna binding domain . these results suggest the existence of a link between dna methylation and arginine methylation .
to identify genes encoding proteins specifically interacting with _PROTEIN_ we carried out a yeast two hybrid screening of an arabidopsis cdna library from inflorescences obtained from _PROTEIN_ . a total of clones were tested using the _PROTEIN_ cdna fused to the binding domain as bait _PROTEIN_ . approximately independent cdna clones exhibited gene activation . a further screening step consisting of activation of the galactosidase reporter gene reduced the number of positive clones by approximately one third . several positive clones isolated in independent transformations carried the same cdna coding for a amino acid peptide with homology to a putative arabidopsis arginine methyltransferase _PROTEIN_ . as the clones appeared to be incomplete the full length cdna of nucleotides corresponding to _PROTEIN_ in chromdb was cloned by pcr . to determine whether full length _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ can interact we generated a pad _PROTEIN_ and co transformed it and the pbd _PROTEIN_ into yeast cells . only yeast cells _PROTEIN_ pad _PROTEIN_ and pbd _PROTEIN_ constructs were able to grow on ade his plates and to _PROTEIN_ galactosidase activity demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ form a complex in yeast two hybrid interaction analysis . the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ arginine methyltransferase was confirmed using a glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ pull down assay . recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ protein alone were separately incubated with in vitro transcribed and translated methionine labelled _PROTEIN_ protein . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ alone was able to bind _PROTEIN_ . quantification of the autoradiographic signal indicated that about of the input was bound . to test whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interact in plant cells we first examined their co localization . arabidopsis protoplasts co _PROTEIN_ cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ and yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ were analysed by confocal microscopy . as already shown _PROTEIN_ has a strong _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ with particularly bright spots corresponding to chromocentres . _PROTEIN_ also has a prevalent _LOCATION_ localization although some _METHOD_ could be observed in the cytoplasm . _PROTEIN_ shows a homogeneous distribution inside the _LOCATION_ and like _PROTEIN_ is excluded from the nucleolus . interestingly a small spot inside the nucleolus is often identifiable for both proteins . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ appear to occupy common subcellular locations at least in part . co immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out to verify the in vivo interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . arabidopsis protoplasts were transiently transfected with flag tagged _PROTEIN_ and ha tagged _PROTEIN_ . the immunoprecipitation of flag _PROTEIN_ protein induced the co precipitation of ha _PROTEIN_ protein as revealed by western blot assay performed with anti ha antibody . as _PROTEIN_ contains three mbd domains we tested each mbd domain s capability of interacting with _PROTEIN_ . three constructs each containing an mbd motif fused to the binding domain _PROTEIN_ were tested in the yeast two hybrid screening . figure shows that the three constructs are _PROTEIN_ in yeast . using lacz as reporter gene we demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ binds only the _PROTEIN_ terminus of the _PROTEIN_ protein containing domain iii . structural analysis of the _PROTEIN_ sequence revealed several important features . the gene comprises an orf coding for a protein of aa with a predicted molecular _METHOD_ of kda . _PROTEIN_ shares very high similarity with another member of the arabidopsis prmt family and with the human proteins and . the homology is less significant for other known human or plant prmts . based on these homologies the arabidopsis protein can also be easily divided as can the human proteins into three domains s adenosyl methionine binding domain a dimerization arm and a barrel domain which should contain the active site . all the protein motifs conserved in adomet dependent methyltransferases can be found in _PROTEIN_ with the exception of the post i domain . two other regions shared by all prmts can be found in the _PROTEIN_ protein the so called double e loop and the thw loop the former containing two invariant glutamate residues shown by crystallographic studies to form the active site pocket . these data strongly suggest that _PROTEIN_ protein is an arginine methyltransferase . to verify the catalytic activity of _PROTEIN_ we performed in vitro methylation assays with the purified recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . as substrates we used proteins extracted from arabidopsis cell cultures treated with adenosine dialdehyde a specific inhibitor of arginine methylation that induces accumulation of unmethylated arginines . first we confirmed that the adox treatment effectively reduces the level of methylated proteins . subsequently we showed that _PROTEIN_ in the presence of s adenosyl l methionine as methyl donor is able to methylate the hypomethylated substrates in lysates from adox treated plant cells . no radioactive incorporation was observed with proteins derived from untreated cells . the latter evidence is not surprising as in other _METHOD_ arginine methylation is considered _PROTEIN_ a permanent mark . although some endogenous prmt activity is detectable in the cell extracts incubated with the _PROTEIN_ alone the addition of the recombinant _PROTEIN_ clearly increases the quantity of the labelled bands and/or their intensity indicating that _PROTEIN_ is able to methylate protein residues . these residues must be arginines because they were available only after blocking arginine methyltransferase activity with the specific inhibitor . the in vitro methylation assay with the recombinant _PROTEIN_ was also performed with _LOCATION_ protein extracts from untreated and adox treated cells . the higher level of methyl incorporation and the similarity with the protein pattern obtained with the cellular extract suggest that _PROTEIN_ substrates are _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ protein . the in vitro methylation assay also revealed that _PROTEIN_ like the animal is able to methylate histones . the _PROTEIN_ tagged protein incubated with purified calf thymus histones and adomet predominantly methylates histone and to a lesser extent histones and . a similar methylation pattern was obtained with _PROTEIN_ immunoprecipitated from flag tagged _PROTEIN_ transfected protoplasts . the in vitro methylated histones and proteins were also analysed by western blot with and antibodies which specifically recognize respectively asymmetrically dimethylated arginine and symmetrically dimethylated arginine residues to determine whether _PROTEIN_ is a type i or ii methyltransferase . unfortunately methylated histones were undetectable probably due to the specificity of antibodies used which consequently recognize only a sub set of methylated proteins . however it is possible that the degree of methylation generated by _PROTEIN_ activity on adox treated cell extracts was too low to be detected by non radioactive methods . we therefore investigated the effect of the absence of _PROTEIN_ activity on the level of symmetrically or asymmetrically methylated arginine in proteins of mutant arabidopsis plants . a _PROTEIN_ t dna insertional mutant obtained from nasc was employed in this study . and plants were used for dna rna and protein extraction southern blot analysis revealed that the t dna was exclusively inserted into the _PROTEIN_ gene while genomic pcr showed that all plants were homozygous for the mutation . inactivation of the target gene was confirmed by semi quantitative rt pcr experiments using primers specific for _PROTEIN_ and for tubulin as control . the rt pcr analysis revealed that all mutant plants showed the total absence of _PROTEIN_ mrna while control plants did not show any variation in mrna level . to rule out that the inactivation of _PROTEIN_ was accompanied by upregulation of other members of the atprmt gene family semi quantitative rt pcr experiments were performed using primers specific for all the other atprmt sequences available . this analysis revealed that their _PROTEIN_ level did not vary among mutant plants . the protein methylation analysis was first performed with adma antiserum . probably due to the rg rich specificity of the antibodies used only a limited number of proteins were recognized in the western blot . minor additional bands were visible only after long exposures but this caused overexposure of the _PROTEIN_ bands and impeded the quantitative analysis . therefore we decided to focus our attention on the _PROTEIN_ bands observed . in control plants two major adma containing proteins were recognized by with apparent molecular weights of around and kda . on the other hand in the _PROTEIN_ mutant the methylation level of the kda protein was markedly reduced compared with the kda band which appeared to remain constant . subsequently we _PROTEIN_ the same blot with the sdma antiserum . this antibody detected one major band at around kda in all the extracts . interestingly the antibody strongly detected a kda band in mutant extracts which was absent in control plants and resembled the size of the protein for which the arginine asymmetrical methylation level appeared reduced in the previous experiment . to quantify these variations the western blot experiments with and antibodies were performed on six _PROTEIN_ mutant plants and three control plants . the densitometric analysis of the relevant bands indicated that in the _PROTEIN_ mutant the adma level of the kda band was reduced by while the sdma level increased three times . these results taken together indicate that _PROTEIN_ acts as a type i prmt catalysing the formation of adma residues and suggest that this enzyme is specific for a sub set of arginine methylatable proteins . t dna mutant plants were also analysed at the phenotype level . plants exhibited altered leaf morphology and development and multiple rosettes with an increased number of leaves . this phenotype was accompanied by delayed flowering as compared with control plants . the inflorescence morphology was also modified with several sterile flowers . the fertility of plants appeared greatly reduced with very low seed production when self pollinated . to test whether _PROTEIN_ is capable of interacting with arginine methyltransferases glutathione sepharose containing _PROTEIN_ alone _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ c were incubated with arabidopsis _LOCATION_ extracts . recovered complexes were analysed for arginine methylation activity using core histones as substrate and adomet as methyl donor . recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ c but not _PROTEIN_ protein alone precipitated the enzymatic activity able to methylate and histones in vitro the same pattern as obtained with the purified recombinant _PROTEIN_ . the direct interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ and the presence of canonical sites for arginine methylation in this mbd protein suggest that _PROTEIN_ could be a substrate for _PROTEIN_ activity . to determine whether this is the case we used recombinant full length _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as well as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a b and c as substrates in methylation reactions with recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the escherichia coli purified full length _PROTEIN_ proved unsuitable for this assay due to its instability . the assay revealed that _PROTEIN_ specifically methylates only the portion comprising domain ii which is consistent with the _PROTEIN_ that it contains the higher number of methylatable rg or rxr sites as compared with the other portions . no significant labelling was detected on the other two protein portions nor on _PROTEIN_ alone . we investigated whether the adox treatment affects the sub cellular localization of _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts from adox treated cells did not show any alteration in sub _LOCATION_ localization in comparison with control protoplasts as previously described in figure suggesting that arginine methylation is not the _PROTEIN_ determinant for _PROTEIN_ localization . as the methylation level of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ could not be assessed we can not rule out that the tagged protein might be methylated to some degree even if translated in the presence of the arginine methylation inhibitor .
