land plants possess myosin classes viii and xi . although some information is available on the molecular properties of class xi myosins class viii myosins are not characterized . here we report the first analysis of the enzymatic properties of class viii myosin . the motor domain of arabidopsis class viii myosin _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the motor domain plus one iq motif _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ in a baculovirus system and characterized . _PROTEIN_ md and _PROTEIN_ had low actin activated _PROTEIN_ activity although their affinities for actin were high . the actin sliding velocities of _PROTEIN_ md and _PROTEIN_ were and respectively from which the value for full length _PROTEIN_ is calculated to be . the results of actin co sedimentation assay showed that the duty ratio of _PROTEIN_ was . adp dissociation from the complex _PROTEIN_ was extremely slow which accounts for the low actin sliding velocity low actin activated _PROTEIN_ activity and high duty ratio . the rate of adp dissociation from acto _PROTEIN_ was markedly biphasic with fast and slow phase rates . physiological concentrations of free modulated actin sliding velocity and actin activated _PROTEIN_ activity by changing the rate of adp dissociation from acto _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ fused full length _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis was localized to plasmodesmata _LOCATION_ newly formed cell walls and actin filaments at the cell cortex . our results suggest that _PROTEIN_ functions as a tension sensor/generator at the cell cortex and other structures in arabidopsis .
a schematic diagram of native _PROTEIN_ deduced from its amino acid sequence is shown in fig . native _PROTEIN_ . native _PROTEIN_ includes motor and neck domains with four iq motifs and coiled coil and globular tail domains . it is likely that calmodulin or calmodulin like light chains bind to each iq motif and that native _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a dimer through the interaction of its coiled coil domain . we generated two recombinant _PROTEIN_ constructs called _PROTEIN_ md and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ md contains a single motor domain and _PROTEIN_ includes a motor domain and the first iq motif . the expected lever arm lengths of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and native _PROTEIN_ are and nm respectively . _PROTEIN_ md and _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ using a baculovirus system . _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ along with arabidopsis calmodulin . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were purified by co precipitation with actin and nickel affinity resin . for _PROTEIN_ purification arabidopsis calmodulin was added to the purification buffer throughout the purification . purified _PROTEIN_ contained calmodulin with stoichiometry . when external calmodulin was deleted before washing the ni _PROTEIN_ column the stoichiometry _PROTEIN_ below . these results suggest that calmodulin was weakly bound to the first iq motif as a light chain which was in equilibrium with the external calmodulin . it is also possible that the iq motif might bind other light chains not just calmodulin . the basal _PROTEIN_ activities of _PROTEIN_ md and _PROTEIN_ were extremely low . the _PROTEIN_ activities were markedly activated by actin . vmax of actin activated _PROTEIN_ activities _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are lower by a _PROTEIN_ of compared with those of plant class xi myosins and are similar to those of animal unconventional myosins such as classes v vi and x . kactin values _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are considerably less than those of plant specific class xi myosins and similar to those of animal unconventional myosins such as classes v and vi . the actin sliding velocities of _PROTEIN_ md and _PROTEIN_ measured using an in vitro actin gliding assay were and respectively at . the difference may be explained by the differences in their lever arm length because the velocities of myosins are proportional to their lever arm length if their motor domains are the same . based on these results and lever arm length of native _PROTEIN_ we estimated that the velocity of native _PROTEIN_ is at . this value is only of those of plant specific class xi myosins and is similar to those of unconventional animal slow myosins such as classes v vi and x . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ functions as a slow transporter and/or a tension generator . actin activated _PROTEIN_ activities and actin sliding velocities of certain unconventional animal myosins that exhibit low actin activated _PROTEIN_ activities and slow actin velocities are regulated by free . free i in animal cells is not stable but varies temporally and spatially in the range mm . although studies about free i in plant cells was limited a similar concentration was estimated . therefore we investigated whether actin sliding velocity and actin activated _PROTEIN_ activities of _PROTEIN_ were regulated by free in this concentration range . the relationship between velocities and free was the same for _PROTEIN_ md and _PROTEIN_ iq . when free increased actin sliding velocity _PROTEIN_ . actin sliding velocities in the presence of and mm free were higher by _PROTEIN_ of and respectively than in the presence of mm . actin activated _PROTEIN_ activities also _PROTEIN_ when free increased . vmax of actin activated _PROTEIN_ activities of _PROTEIN_ md at and mm were higher by _PROTEIN_ of and respectively than those in the presence of mm . to unravel the molecular mechanism underlying slow actin sliding velocity and the dependence of actin activated _PROTEIN_ activity and actin sliding velocity on free we investigated the kinetic properties of _PROTEIN_ . we used _PROTEIN_ md for kinetic analyses because its steady state _PROTEIN_ activity and modulation of actin sliding velocity by free were the same as those of _PROTEIN_ although it is possible that there could still be differences between _PROTEIN_ md and _PROTEIN_ . kinetic modeling and simulations of actomyosin were performed according to the simplified reaction mechanism as shown in scheme which has been used in kinetic studies of many myosins . we first investigated the molecular basis underlying slow actin sliding velocity . in general the actin sliding velocities of myosins depend on the time when they are strongly bound to actin . ts is primarily determined by the adp dissociation rate from acto myosin and the acto myosin dissociation rate upon _PROTEIN_ binding at saturating _PROTEIN_ concentrations . therefore we determined these rates . the acto myosin dissociation reaction upon _PROTEIN_ binding can be described as a two step process and the rate constant is _PROTEIN_ as _PROTEIN_ / _PROTEIN_ . the first step in scheme is the formation of a collision complex between acto myosin and _PROTEIN_ which are in rapid equilibrium . the second step is the dissociation of myosin _PROTEIN_ from actin following the isomerization of myosin . to determine and a md complex was dissociated by mixing with _PROTEIN_ using a stopped flow apparatus and the acto _PROTEIN_ md dissociation was monitored by the increase in pyrene _METHOD_ . the values of and were obtained by fitting the data to _PROTEIN_ / _PROTEIN_ . the values of and were and respectively . the acto _PROTEIN_ md dissociation rate in the presence of a physiological concentration of _PROTEIN_ was which is extremely fast to explain the slow actin sliding velocity of _PROTEIN_ . the rate of adp dissociation from acto _PROTEIN_ md was determined by measuring the _PROTEIN_ in the _METHOD_ intensity of adp . time course of _METHOD_ change followed a double exponential with fast and slow rate constants in the presence of mm free . the relative amplitudes of the fast and slow phases were and respectively . when pyrene actin _METHOD_ was used to determine the adp dissociation rate similar double exponentials were observed . these results show that there are two acto myosin adp states in _PROTEIN_ . in animal slow myosins such as myosin iii v and vii similar two actomyosin adp states were reported . in these studies it is proposed that two states in the active site namely open and closed pockets are in equilibrium . according to these studies we interpret our results as follows fast and slow exhibit adp dissociation rates from the open and closed pockets respectively . slow was much slower than the actin activated vmax value . because no transition on the _PROTEIN_ pathway can be slower than the transition that limits the overall _PROTEIN_ cycle it is more likely that the slow transition is indicative of a branched or a parallel pathway . the fast value is similar to for animal slow myosins and most probably explains the slow actin sliding velocity of _PROTEIN_ . the value of fast is nearly equal to the vmax value of the actin activated _PROTEIN_ indicating that most of the actin activated _PROTEIN_ cycle is occupied with the strong binding state and that _PROTEIN_ is a high duty ratio myosin . we subsequently investigated the dependence of adp dissociation rate from acto _PROTEIN_ md on free because the actin sliding velocity and actin activated _PROTEIN_ activity of _PROTEIN_ were significantly affected by free and the rate limiting step of these were adp dissociations from acto _PROTEIN_ as mentioned above . the value of particularly that of fast depended strongly on free . the values of fast in the presence of and mm free were higher by _PROTEIN_ of and respectively than in the presence of mm free . these results indicate that free dependent modulation of the actin sliding velocity and actin activated _PROTEIN_ activity of _PROTEIN_ is driven by free dependent modulation of adp dissociation from acto _PROTEIN_ . the rate of mant adp binding to acto _PROTEIN_ md was biphasic with observed fast and slow rate constants consistent with the two acto states described above . the observed fast rate constants depended linearly on mant adp concentrations . the association rate constant of adp with acto _PROTEIN_ md of the fast phase was . the observed slow rate constants were almost independent of mant adp concentrations in the concentration range measured and were . the relative amplitudes of each fast and slow phase were similar at every mant adp concentration and the average values were and for fast and slow phases respectively . the equilibrium dissociation constant for adp binding to acto _PROTEIN_ of the slow phase is calculated as slow and is . the equilibrium dissociation constant for adp binding to acto _PROTEIN_ of the fast phase is calculated as fast and is . the overall equilibrium dissociation constant for adp binding to acto _PROTEIN_ is calculated as fast and is . this value is similar to that of animal myosin va and is one of the lowest among all myosins showing the high affinity of acto _PROTEIN_ for adp . kinetic parameters in the absence of actin were also measured . the rate of adp dissociation from _PROTEIN_ md was determined by measuring the _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ intensity of mant adp and followed by a double exponential with fast and slow rate constants in the presence of mm free . the relative amplitudes of fast and slow phases were and respectively . similar to the adp dissociation rate from acto _PROTEIN_ md the dissociation rate of adp from _PROTEIN_ md was also dependent on free concentrations . the rate of adp binding to _PROTEIN_ md was monitored using mant adp . the time courses of reactions were biphasic with observed fast and slow rate constants . the observed fast rate constants linearly depended on mant adp concentrations . the association rate constant of adp with _PROTEIN_ md of the fast phase was . the observed slow rate constants were almost independent of mant adp concentrations in the concentration range measured and were . the relative amplitudes of each fast and slow phase were almost the same at every mant adp concentration and the average values were and for fast and slow phases respectively . the equilibrium dissociation constant for adp binding to _PROTEIN_ of the slow phase is calculated as k slow and is . the equilibrium dissociation constant for adp binding to _PROTEIN_ of the fast phase is calculated as k fast and is . the overall equilibrium dissociation constant for adp binding to _PROTEIN_ is calculated as fast and is . to determine the affinity of _PROTEIN_ for actin in the presence of _PROTEIN_ actin co sedimentation assays were performed under physiological ionic conditions . fig . shows the fraction of _PROTEIN_ md bound to actin as a function of actin concentration . the data were fit to a hyperbola to determine the actin affinity in the presence of _PROTEIN_ . the equilibrium dissociation constant for actin binding to _PROTEIN_ in the presence of _PROTEIN_ was . this value is similar to that of animal myosin iii which is known to have high affinity for actin . the maximum percentage bound to actin was showing that _PROTEIN_ is a high duty ratio myosin . the affinity of _PROTEIN_ for actin in the absence of _PROTEIN_ was measured using pyrene actin . the transients were fit to a single exponential function at each actin concentration . the association rate constant linearly increased with actin concentration to yield the second order rate constant of . the intercept of fig . yields the acto _PROTEIN_ md dissociation rate constants but is subject to a large uncertainty when it is low so dissociation was measured directly by competition with unlabeled actin filaments . the observed rates were fit to a single exponential function which yielded a rate constant of of k . the equilibrium dissociation constant for actin binding to _PROTEIN_ in the absence of _PROTEIN_ is calculated as k and is nm . this value is lower by a _PROTEIN_ of than that of animal skeletal myosin ii and by a _PROTEIN_ of than that of animal myosins iii and vii that are known to have high affinity for actin . this indicates that _PROTEIN_ binds actin with very high affinity in the strong binding state . to determine the tissue specific _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ we created a transgenic arabidopsis plant that _PROTEIN_ a gus fusion protein under the transcriptional control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter . gus staining indicated that _PROTEIN_ was abundantly _PROTEIN_ in seedlings apices of shoots shoots and flowers but not in pollen . in earlier studies using an antibody against a peptide corresponding to a tail domain of _PROTEIN_ it was suggested that _PROTEIN_ is localized to the plasmodesmata and newly formed cell walls in root cells of maize and arabidopsis . the same antibody was used to show the localization of _PROTEIN_ on _LOCATION_ . moreover when the _METHOD_ fused tail domain of _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis it was localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and plasmodesmata . to obtain accurate information about the localization of _PROTEIN_ we used _METHOD_ fused full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in this study because tail domain _PROTEIN_ sometimes acts as a dominant negative leading to artifactual localization . first _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was transiently _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts of cultured arabidopsis cells and was observed using a high speed confocal laser scanning microscope . _METHOD_ dots were observed at the cell cortex similar to the results of previous studies using the _METHOD_ fused tail domain of _PROTEIN_ . however in contrast to other studies punctate structures were present on filamentous structures such as actin bundles . to ascertain that this structure was formed by f actin lifeact _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ together with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was co localized with lifeact _METHOD_ at the cell cortex indicating that _PROTEIN_ associated with f actin at the cell cortex . live imaging showed little movement of the dots on f actin . this is consistent with the results of the in vitro actin gliding assays which showed that _PROTEIN_ is an extremely slow myosin . next _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis plants . to avoid artifacts arising from differences in _PROTEIN_ level and pattern a construct _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of the native _PROTEIN_ promoter was transformed into an arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ knock out mutant _PROTEIN_ . fig . shows the _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in epidermal cells of root tip _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was localized to newly formed cell plates consistent with another study . in a growing elongating zone of epidermal cells _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was observed as _METHOD_ dots on filamentous structures similar to protoplasts . to determine whether these filamentous structures were composed of f actin we treated cells with cytoskeletal inhibitors . the filamentous structures did not form in the presence of latrunculin b but persisted when the cells were exposed to oryzalin . these data confirm that the filamentous structures consisted of f actin . live imaging showed little movement of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ dots on f actin consistent with the results of the in vitro actin gliding assays . the _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in epidermal cells of cotyledons is shown in fig . f and g. focusing on the center of the cell _PROTEIN_ was localized to the punctate structures on _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ that border neighboring cells supporting an earlier observation that an anti _PROTEIN_ antibody stains the plasmodesmata . _PROTEIN_ was also localized to structures presumed to be _LOCATION_ consistent with the results of a published study . focusing on the subcortical region of the cell _PROTEIN_ was observed at filamentous structures most likely f actin .
full length cdnas of arabidopsis class viii myosin _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and arabidopsis calmodulin _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were provided by the _PROTEIN_ bio resource center . baculovirus transfer vectors for _PROTEIN_ md _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were generated using site directed mutagenesis polymerase chain reactions as follows . _PROTEIN_ cdna was mutated to create an ncoi site at the end of nucleotide of _PROTEIN_ and an agei site at the end of nucleotide of _PROTEIN_ md or at nucleotide of _PROTEIN_ . pcr products were digested using ncoi and agei and ligated to the ncoi agei fragment of pfastbac md . these constructs _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ encode amino acid residues of _PROTEIN_ or of _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ md and _PROTEIN_ respectively and also include a flexible linker a myc epitope sequence and a tag . _PROTEIN_ md and _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ in high fivetm cells and purified as described previously . _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ along with arabidopsis calmodulin because the light chains of many unconventional myosins are calmodulin . similar to many unconventional myosins iii and viia and our previous paper xi va chimera we added arabidopsis calmodulin during purification and experiments to ensure that the iq domains had bound calmodulin . a baculovirus transfer vector for arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ was generated as follows . an arabidopsis cdna encoding _PROTEIN_ was mutated to create an xbai site at the end and xhoi site at the end using site directed mutagenesis pcr . pcr products were digested with xbai and xhoi and ligated to the xbai and xhoi fragment of pfastbac . this construct encodes full length arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ . this was _PROTEIN_ in insect cells and purified as described previously . for the promoter gus _PROTEIN_ assay kb of flanking sequences containing the first exon of _PROTEIN_ was pcr amplified and subcloned into pentr d topo and subsequently exchanged into the binary vector using lr according to the manufacturer 's instructions . for transient _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts an _PROTEIN_ cdna _PROTEIN_ was amplified from total rna purified from arabidopsis seedlings and subcloned into pentr/d topo . the _PROTEIN_ sequence in the pentr d topo cloning vector was exchanged into the binary vector _METHOD_ using the lr reaction . for _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis full length genomic _PROTEIN_ dna including the cdna encoding _METHOD_ upstream of the translational start codon was generated by _METHOD_ tagging . the _PROTEIN_ fragment contains kb of and kb of flanking sequences . amplified chimeric fragments were subcloned into the binary vector . steady state _PROTEIN_ activities were measured using a modified malachite green method . to avoid the possible inhibitory effect of adp on binding of _PROTEIN_ to the active site _PROTEIN_ activities were measured when the molar ratio of adp/atp was less than . the reaction mixtures for the assay of the basal _PROTEIN_ activity contained mm kcl mm mm hepes koh mm egta mm dtt mm _PROTEIN_ mg/ml bsa and _PROTEIN_ md or _PROTEIN_ . the reaction mixtures for the assay of actin activated _PROTEIN_ activity contained mm kcl mm mm hepes koh mm egta mm dtt mm _PROTEIN_ mg/ml bsa f actin and _PROTEIN_ md or _PROTEIN_ . actin sliding velocities were measured using an anti myc antibody based version of the in vitro actin gliding assay as described . to avoid the possible inhibitory effect of adp on actin sliding velocities an _PROTEIN_ regeneration system was included . to compare with other myosins the reactions of steady state _PROTEIN_ activities in vitro actin gliding assay and kinetic measurements were conducted in the commonly used ionic strength and temperature unless stated otherwise . the free was mm unless otherwise stated . the standard solution was as follows mm kcl mm mm hepes koh mm _PROTEIN_ mm dtt mm egta . in some experiments using either or mm of free the ionic strengths were adjusted to mm by changing the kcl concentration . the compositions of the assay mixtures were as follows mm free mm kcl mm mm hepes koh mm _PROTEIN_ mm dtt mm egta mm free mm kcl mm mm hepes koh mm _PROTEIN_ mm dtt mm egta . free and ionic strength were calculated using _PROTEIN_ which is based on goldstein 's algorithm . _PROTEIN_ activities and in vitro actin gliding assays were done at . for _PROTEIN_ activities and in vitro actin gliding assays of _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis calmodulin was added in the assay buffer . co sedimentation assays were performed as described except that the solution was mm in ionic strength mm _PROTEIN_ mm egta mm dtt mm phosphocreatine and units/ml creatine phosphokinase . in brief _PROTEIN_ md was mixed with actin and centrifuged at g for min at in the presence of _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ generation system . less than actin phalloidin actin was used . the supernatant of each actin concentration was subjected to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the fraction of _PROTEIN_ md bound to actin was determined by quantifying the amount of _PROTEIN_ md in the supernatant using imagej software . about of _PROTEIN_ was precipitated in the absence of actin . thus it is necessary to remove this artificial effect presumably caused by the aggregations of _PROTEIN_ to calculate the actual amount of acto _PROTEIN_ precipitations . so the amount of the pellet and the supernatant at actin was set as zero and total amount of _PROTEIN_ md respectively . therefore the fraction unbound at each concentration of actin was calculated as follows / . the fraction bound was plotted as a function of actin concentration to determine the affinity of _PROTEIN_ md for actin in the presence of _PROTEIN_ . all kinetic experiments were performed using an applied photophysics stopped flow spectrophotometer _METHOD_ as described . the solution used for the transient kinetic experiments was the same as that used for the _PROTEIN_ activities and the in vitro actin gliding assays unless stated otherwise . the transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts prepared from suspension cultures of arabidopsis cells was conducted as follows g of cultured cells was incubated in ml of enzyme solution for h at and filtered through a nylon mesh . protoplasts were washed twice with ml of solution a and resuspended in ml of mamg solution . after adding of plasmid and of carrier dna to of protoplast solution of dna uptake solution was added . the protoplasts were incubated on ice for min and subsequently diluted with ml of dilution solution _PROTEIN_ . the protoplasts were resuspended in ml of _METHOD_ medium containing m mannitol and incubated with gentle agitation at for h in the dark . plasmids were electroporated into agrobacterium tumefaciens strain using a gene pulser . they were introduced into an arabidopsis atm knock out line _PROTEIN_ using the floral dipping method . plants with resistance to hygromycin were selected . generation plants were used for the promoter gus assay and homozygous plants were used for imaging full length _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in cells was detected using a spinning disk confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with a high resolution ccd camera _PROTEIN_ . the images were processed using ivision macintosh software _PROTEIN_ .
