we identified an arabidopsis ethyl methanesulfonate mutant modified _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ in a _METHOD_ confocal microscopy screen for plants with mislocalization of a green _METHOD_ protein tonoplast intrinsic protein fusion . the _PROTEIN_ mutant displayed static perinuclear aggregates of the reporter protein . _PROTEIN_ mutants also exhibited a number of _LOCATION_ related phenotypes as demonstrated by defects in growth utilization of stored _PROTEIN_ gravitropic response salt sensitivity and specific susceptibility to the fungal necrotroph alternaria brassicicola . similarly crosses with other endomembrane marker fusions identified mislocalization to aggregate structures indicating a general defect in protein trafficking . map based cloning showed that the _PROTEIN_ mutation altered a gene encoding a putative myrosinase associated protein and glutathione s transferase pull down assays demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ interacted specifically with the arabidopsis myrosinase protein thioglucoside _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ . moreover the _PROTEIN_ mutant showed increased nitrile production during _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis suggesting that _PROTEIN_ may play a role in modulation of myrosinase activity . we propose that _PROTEIN_ is a myrosinase associated protein that functions in part to correctly localize the myrosinase _PROTEIN_ and prevent inappropriate _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis that could generate cytotoxic molecules .
the _PROTEIN_ mutant was isolated via visually detectable defects in _LOCATION_ protein targeting . _PROTEIN_ was previously categorized within the aggregates of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ class of mutants based on static subcellular _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labeled _LOCATION_ structures . in _PROTEIN_ aggregates were perinuclear and restricted to aerial tissues . to assess the effects of _PROTEIN_ on trafficking of other endomembrane markers it was outcrossed to lines _PROTEIN_ different reporters . yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ an _LOCATION_ marker was observed as a web like network at the periphery of wild type cells whereas in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was delivered to the _LOCATION_ but the perinuclear aggregates were also visible . _METHOD_ a _LOCATION_ marker labeled punctate structures located around the cell periphery whereas in _PROTEIN_ the marker was also found in the aggregates . the tonoplast localized _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ like protein mislocalized to the cellular aggregates in _PROTEIN_ indicating mistargeting of other tonoplast proteins . _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ intrinsic protein _PROTEIN_ localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in wild type and mutant plants but accumulated in _PROTEIN_ aggregates . we considered the possibility that aggregate formation was caused in part by overexpression of _METHOD_ protein markers so we examined both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings containing no driven constructs in their genetic backgrounds . seedlings were stained with the endocytic styryl dye and examined by confocal microscopy . we observed aggregates in both alleles indicating that aggregate formation was due solely to the mutation in the _PROTEIN_ gene . these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ widely disrupts endomembrane trafficking and causes a block early in trafficking pathways . because the plant endomembrane system is essential for an array of physiological pathways we assessed endomembrane functionality in _PROTEIN_ by evaluating the endomembrane associated processes such as growth gravitropism _PROTEIN_ utilization abiotic stress responses and pathogen defense . all of these processes were negatively affected in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . rough mapping using dna isolated from progeny of an outcross to the landsberg _LOCATION_ accession placed the _PROTEIN_ mutation between markers and _PROTEIN_ on chromosome . this interval was approximately kb or centimorgan . we narrowed this interval to kb using a fine mapping population composed of mutant plants . targeted sequencing of genes in the interval identified a bp change in the first exon of _GENE_ whose annotation was based on similarity to oilseed rape myaps with a gdsl lipase motif . this change in the _PROTEIN_ gene resulted in a missense mutation that converted a predicted gly to a glu . we isolated a second allele _PROTEIN_ that had a t dna insertion in the first exon of _PROTEIN_ . this allele had phenotypic defects similar to _PROTEIN_ including subcellular aggregates as visualized by and sensitivity to nacl . the _PROTEIN_ point mutation did not reduce transcript levels relative to the wild type but the _PROTEIN_ insertion allele showed significantly reduced transcript . the _PROTEIN_ line was successfully complemented with a construct that consisted of the native _PROTEIN_ gene and approximately kb of sequence upstream of the translation start site . the combination of complementation results and two independent alleles having similar phenotypes confirmed that _GENE_ is _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ gene has a kb genomic sequence and a kb coding sequence with five exons and four introns . the full length cdna encodes a amino acid protein with a molecular _METHOD_ of approximately kd and pi of . analysis using the signalp prediction server indicated that _PROTEIN_ had a signal peptide from residues to that facilitates entry into the _LOCATION_ and was cleaved between residues and to yield a protein of approximately kd . sequence similarity searches showed that _PROTEIN_ was a member of a large gdsl lipase protein family . this family consisted of members from eight different fully sequenced plant genomes including members from arabidopsis and all _METHOD_ represented in the uniprot database . within this superfamily the sequences with closest identity to _PROTEIN_ formed a distinct subclade of putative myaps based on sequence similarities to glycoproteins found in myrosinase complexes of oilseed rape . myrosinases are _PROTEIN_ that hydrolyze _PROTEIN_ which are sulfur and nitrogen containing secondary metabolites . the _PROTEIN_ myrosinase system is found almost exclusively in the order capparales which includes the brassicaceae plants oilseed rape and arabidopsis . upon tissue disruption _PROTEIN_ are hydrolyzed by myrosinases . the hydrolysis yields an aglucone intermediate that either spontaneously rearranges into an isothiocyanate or combined with the actions of specifier and modifier proteins into epithionitriles nitriles or thiocyanates . arabidopsis contains six myrosinase genes _PROTEIN_ to . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ in aerial tissue albeit with somewhat different cell type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is found in phloem associated and stomatal guard cells whereas _PROTEIN_ is found only in phloem associated cells . the functions of the two proteins appear to be redundant because _PROTEIN_ breakdown in single null mutants was similar to that in the wild type . the clade that includes _PROTEIN_ also contained four sequences for oilseed rape myaps and six additional arabidopsis genes only one of which epithiospecifier _PROTEIN_ has been characterized . the gene was identified as part of a quantitative trait locus on chromosome that in combination with the epithiospecifier protein _PROTEIN_ gene affected the nitrile to isothiocyanate ratio in _PROTEIN_ metabolism . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pattern was examined using the genevestigator reference _PROTEIN_ database and analysis tool . the _PROTEIN_ transcript was found throughout arabidopsis tissues with highest _PROTEIN_ in imbibed seed . these data were consistent with our observation of unusual punctate structures visible in mature _PROTEIN_ embryos before the formation of the central _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ was also _PROTEIN_ throughout the seedling rosette leaves and inflorescence but not in pollen . interestingly _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in roots where we did not observe any aggregate formation . _PROTEIN_ transcript was detected at moderate levels during all developmental stages of the arabidopsis life cycle with highest mrna accumulation in germinated seeds . we also carried out reverse transcription pcr for the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and genes using total rna isolated from week old seedlings week old roots and rosette leaves inflorescence _METHOD_ flowers and green siliques . the data from this experiment were consistent with that reported in the genevestigator database . our laboratory has previously identified _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ proteome specifically in the tonoplast fraction and a variety of observations suggest that _PROTEIN_ may also function in plant defense . first as discussed above _PROTEIN_ has been shown to be involved in defense against insect herbivory indicating a possible role in defense for this family . second microarray data show that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was up regulated by both pathogen infestation and methyl jasmonate a well characterized plant defense hormone . _PROTEIN_ transcript accumulation was also induced by the bacterial pathogens agrobacterium tumefaciens and pseudomonas syringae the fungal necrotrophs botrytis cinerea and alternaria brassicicola and the oomycete phytophthora infestans . specifier proteins such as _PROTEIN_ do not have direct hydrolytic activity on _PROTEIN_ but they do influence the type of _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis product formed . to elucidate the molecular function of _PROTEIN_ we tested its annotation as a putative myap by assessing the ability of _PROTEIN_ glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ recombinant protein to interact with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in a pull down experiment using crude arabidopsis extracts we detected a specific interaction between _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ that was absent in the _PROTEIN_ knockout mutant . furthermore we did not detect a similar interaction between _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ even in the _PROTEIN_ mutant suggesting that _PROTEIN_ interacted with _PROTEIN_ in a highly specific manner . we also tested whether _PROTEIN_ interacted with other known defense related _PROTEIN_ enzymes . neither _PROTEIN_ nor _PROTEIN_ interacted with _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ pull down assays . we examined the microarray databases to determine the coexpression patterns of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are coexpressed in aerial tissues where we observed the aggregate formation phenotype . there was no detectable _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in roots where we did not observe aggregates . queries of the developmental _PROTEIN_ patterns of the two genes revealed that both were _PROTEIN_ throughout the plant life cycle . we next evaluated the capacity of _PROTEIN_ to hydrolyze _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was previously characterized by its ability to alter hydrolysis of _PROTEIN_ such that an _PROTEIN_ mutant showed increased nitrile production . we performed similar experiments to assess the effect of the _PROTEIN_ mutation on _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis . extracts from rosette leaves of week old _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants were incubated with allyl _PROTEIN_ substrate and analyzed by gas chromatography for the presence of nitrile and isothiocyanate breakdown products . a natural knockout polymorphism in _PROTEIN_ leads to a lack of epithionitrile specifier activity and hence epithionitriles within the columbia ecotype . however the _PROTEIN_ mutation caused an increase in the amount of nitrile formed . there was no statistically significant difference in isothiocyanate production . these changes in _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis were statistically significant but not as severe as in the _PROTEIN_ knockout mutant which increases nitrile production to almost and leads to a dramatic _PROTEIN_ in the production of isothiocyanate . we previously identified _PROTEIN_ in the tonoplast . in order to determine whether there are additional sites of localization we transiently _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in arabidopsis seedlings . _PROTEIN_ showed an _LOCATION_ like pattern with a characteristic network of _METHOD_ around the cell periphery dotted with spindle shaped structures that appeared to be _LOCATION_ bodies . we also observed _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in transvacuolar strands confirming that _PROTEIN_ was localized to the tonoplast . _LOCATION_ bodies are _LOCATION_ derived organelles present in both constitutive and induced _METHOD_ where the induced _METHOD_ are present in wounded tissues . electron microscopy has shown that the bodies are localized to the _LOCATION_ lumen . furthermore the _PROTEIN_ gene was found to be down regulated in the _LOCATION_ body formation mutant _PROTEIN_ . because there was strong localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to the _LOCATION_ bodies we examined whether there was a connection between _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ body formation . a fusion of _METHOD_ to the _LOCATION_ retention signal hdel is known to label _LOCATION_ bodies in stable arabidopsis transformants . here we used transient transformation of arabidopsis seedlings with the same construct and found a similar pattern in wild type plants . however _PROTEIN_ accumulated _METHOD_ signal in aggregates and reduced numbers of _LOCATION_ bodies in epidermal cells indicating that _PROTEIN_ may play a role in _LOCATION_ body formation . after demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ specifically interacts with the myrosinase protein _PROTEIN_ we sought to evaluate trafficking of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ binary construct was stably transformed into _PROTEIN_ plants . resistant lines were isolated and progeny were examined by confocal microscopy . the majority of the _METHOD_ reporter was localized to aggregates with the remainder localized to the _LOCATION_ and occasionally to _LOCATION_ bodies demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ trafficking is impeded in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . we also examined _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ background . we created a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ binary construct and transiently transformed this construct and the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ binary construct used for stable transformation into col _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings . confocal microscopy of transformed seedlings revealed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization in wild type and mutant seedlings was consistent with that observed for stably transformed seedlings and the marker was localized primarily to the aggregates . the localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was identical to that of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in wild type and mutant backgrounds . these results reinforce our hypothesis that the _PROTEIN_ mutations cause global trafficking blocks early in the endomembrane trafficking system . given the association of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and the effects of the _PROTEIN_ mutation on nitrile levels we asked if there were trafficking defects in other known _PROTEIN_ metabolism mutants . using we showed that neither _PROTEIN_ nor esp knockout lines formed aggregate structures as observed in the _PROTEIN_ alleles . we did not observe any other obvious malformations in _LOCATION_ structures of the _PROTEIN_ and esp mutants . we also tested the gravitropic responses of the _PROTEIN_ and esp mutants and did not detect any differences compared with the wild type response suggesting that neither of these proteins has trafficking functions . although _PROTEIN_ was annotated as a lipase its putative lipolytic sequence was divergent from the canonical gdsl motif which in wild type col plants is gdgl . the modified catalytic sequence raised questions about whether _PROTEIN_ was actually a lipase . we fused both wild type and mutant proteins to _PROTEIN_ tags to facilitate purification after _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli . recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein was isolated and purified along with the secreted gdsl lipase protein _PROTEIN_ which was used as a positive control . the _PROTEIN_ mutant protein and _PROTEIN_ were also _PROTEIN_ and used as negative controls . hydrolysis of the substrate p nitrophenyl acetate was measured over time to determine lipase activity . _PROTEIN_ hydrolyzed the substrate in a linear fashion over time whereas the _PROTEIN_ mutant protein was deficient in esterase activity . although we used a fold higher amount of _PROTEIN_ recombinant protein compared with the positive control _PROTEIN_ did not hydrolyze p nitrophenyl acetate . the _PROTEIN_ mutant protein showed a similar lack of activity . we concluded that _PROTEIN_ did not act as an esterase for this particular substrate in vitro and the _PROTEIN_ mutation had no effect on this lack of activity . the assay described above tested activity on a short chain acyl substrate thus we also conducted plate assays to determine whether _PROTEIN_ could hydrolyze different lipid substrates . e. coli carrying various _PROTEIN_ constructs was spotted on the plates containing one of three substrates tributyrin tween and tween . all plates were spotted with e. coli cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or an empty vector e. coli _PROTEIN_ a gdsl lipase from the tropical tree jacaranda mimosifolia was used as a positive control . both the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ constructs were negative for the formation of halos and precipitate further demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ does not act as a lipase or esterase .
the _PROTEIN_ mutant was isolated from a population of arabidopsis _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants treated with ethyl methanesulfonate . _PROTEIN_ was backcrossed to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ twice . _PROTEIN_ plants were outcrossed to wild type col to remove the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgene . homozygous _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants were crossed with plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions to endomembrane proteins

for the gravitropism _PROTEIN_ limitation and pathogen sensitivity assays conditions for which are described in supplemental materials and methods . confocal images were collected with a leica tcs laser scanning confocal microscope system and high throughput visual inspection of mapping populations was carried out with the bd pathway ht system . endomembrane structures were visualized after incubation in a solution of liquid murashige and skoog growth medium supplemented with for the described time periods . to visualize dna seedlings were incubated with diamidino phenylindole in phosphate buffered saline for to min . _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were outcrossed to landsberg _LOCATION_ to generate a mapping population . forty eight recombinant _PROTEIN_ homozygotes were analyzed with simple sequence length polymorphism markers spanning the five arabidopsis chromosomes . markers were developed from the monsanto arabidopsis polymorphism collection for fine scale mapping of recombinant _PROTEIN_ mutants . twenty four genes were sequenced in the kb fine map region . a kb fragment containing upstream sequence the full length _PROTEIN_ gene and downstream sequences was amplified from col genomic dna using the following primers _GENE_ l and _GENE_ r . the pcr product was cloned into the vector and then cloned into the binary vector using previously published methods . dna was transformed into agrobacterium tumefaciens strain for introduction into homozygous _PROTEIN_ plants by floral dip . seeds were selected on agar growth medium supplemented with mg kanamycin and examined by laser scanning confocal microscopy . transcript levels for _PROTEIN_ were analyzed with rt pcr for cycles using gene specific primers cttccctcttcttcttctcca and cgttgatagagccagttcca . primers for the gene were aaaatggccgatggtgagg and actcaccaccacgaaccag . related protein sequences were identified by blastp searches with an e value cutoff of against the protein sequences from nine databases arabidopsis oryza sativa populus trichocarpa chlamydomonas reinhardtii ostreococcus tauri phaeodactylum tricornutum physcomitrella patens selaginella moellendorffii and the uniprot database . duplicated sequences within and between databases were removed from the data set . multiple sequence alignments were generated with the t coffee program and motif searches were performed with custom scripts . an initial global multiple alignment and guide tree was constructed for all sequences . the guide tree was calculated with the phylip package using the protdist program for calculating the distance _PROTEIN_ the neighbor joining method for tree construction and the midpoint method in retree for defining the root of the tree . a subclade in the guide tree with members including _PROTEIN_ was selected for the final phylogenetic analysis . these protein sequences plus one outgroup sequence were used to compute a high quality multiple alignment . the final phylogenetic analysis was performed with two different tree construction methods the bayesian phylogenic inference implemented in the program mrbayes and the neighbor joining method from the phylip package . the markov chain monte carlo analysis with mrbayes was performed according to the recommendations of the program manual . the mixed amino acid substitution model was chosen and the simulation was set to generations . the final tree from figure was plotted with the ape package from the statistical r environment using the _GENE_ sequence as outgroup for rooting the tree . the neighbor joining analysis with phylip was performed as described above . bootstrap values for this analysis were computed from alignment resampling steps . cloning and protein _PROTEIN_ were performed as described previously using pcr primers with appended sequences for bamhi and xhoi cloning sites gagaggatccatgcttttgataccttc and gagactcgagttatatcataaaggag . the _PROTEIN_ mutant clone was generated by mutagenic pcr using the following primers with one mismatch gacgctctttgtgttcgaagatggtctttacgacgcc and _PROTEIN_ . protein _PROTEIN_ was induced and lipase activity was measured as described using _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ recombinant proteins as positive and negative controls respectively . to assay for _PROTEIN_ lipase activity in e. coli we performed assays as described previously . briefly isolated e. coli colonies transformed with the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ construct or empty vector were dotted on substrate plates containing mg ampicillin mm isopropylthio galactoside mm and one of the following lipid substrates tween tween or tributyrin . on plates with tributyrin as a lipid substrate the presence of clear halos around the bacterial colonies was indicative of esterase activity . correspondingly the formation of a precipitate around bacterial colonies on tween or tween plates demonstrated lipase activity . e. coli heterologously _PROTEIN_ a gdsl lipase from jacaranda mimosifolia was used as a positive control . partially purified _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ proteins were bound to glutathione sepharose and incubated with protein extracts from arabidopsis col or _PROTEIN_ in pull down buffer and incubated at for h with shaking . beads were washed four times with pull down buffer and bound proteins were eluted and separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ followed by immunoblot analysis with anti _PROTEIN_ or anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies which were kindly provided by ikuko hara nishimura . the structural outcome of _PROTEIN_ activation was assayed using a modified version of a previously published protocol . briefly mg of week old rosette tissue was homogenized in ml of mes acid buffer and of allyl _PROTEIN_
