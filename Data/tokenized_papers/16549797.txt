vernalization is the acceleration of flowering by prolonged cold that aligns the onset of reproductive development with spring conditions . a key step of vernalization in arabidopsis is the epigenetic silencing of flowering locus c _PROTEIN_ which encodes a repressor of flowering . the vernalization induced epigenetic silencing of _PROTEIN_ is associated with histone deacetylation and and methylation mediated by vrn/vin proteins . we have analyzed whether different histone methyltransferases and the chromodomain protein like heterochromatin protein might play a role in vernalization . no single loss of function mutation in the histone methyltransferases studied disrupted the vernalization response however _PROTEIN_ mutants revealed a role for _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ epigenetic silencing of _PROTEIN_ . like _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ functions in both flowering time control and vernalization . we explored the localization of _PROTEIN_ and found it to be associated generally with arabidopsis chromosomes but not the heterochromatic chromocenters . this association did not depend on vernalization or _PROTEIN_ function and was _PROTEIN_ during mitosis but was lost in meiotic chromosomes suggesting that _PROTEIN_ may contribute to chromatin silencing that is not meiotically stable .
the _PROTEIN_ histone methyltransferase _PROTEIN_ has been shown to be essential for most of the in arabidopsis . to analyze whether _PROTEIN_ was involved in the vernalization induced methylation at _PROTEIN_ the kyp mutation _LOCATION_ was introduced into fca . fca causes a vernalization responsive _PROTEIN_ flowering phenotype that can provide the background to test the role of various _PROTEIN_ in vernalization . kyp fca flowered at approximately the same time as fca and showed a similar suppression of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and accelerated flowering after vernalization thus we can conclude that _PROTEIN_ is not necessary for _PROTEIN_ regulation . to expand the search for a histone methyltransferase involved in vernalization we examined _PROTEIN_ levels in seven additional suvh mutants and four suvr mutants . the suvh and suvr alleles contain mutations in genes related to _PROTEIN_ that contain _PROTEIN_ domains predicted to methylate histone . the mutants include a t dna insertion in _PROTEIN_ a gene recently described as being essential for an array of repressive histone methylation marks . these mutants were examined by a combination of northern blots and rt pcr of nonvernalized and vernalized tissue . although many of the suv mutants displayed moderately reduced levels of _PROTEIN_ in nonvernalized seedlings none was impaired in the ability to repress _PROTEIN_ in response to vernalization . flowering time of different genotypes to discover whether _PROTEIN_ plays a role in _PROTEIN_ silencing the vernalization response of plants deficient in _PROTEIN_ was analyzed . the _PROTEIN_ allele was crossed into a line containing an active _PROTEIN_ allele and an _PROTEIN_ translational fusion . the _PROTEIN_ fusion mirrors the regulation of the endogenous _PROTEIN_ gene in response to both _PROTEIN_ fca mutations and vernalization and so provides an effective assay to follow _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ mutation did not alter _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in nonvernalized seedlings but resulted in increased _PROTEIN_ in vernalized seedlings . detailed time course analysis of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in columbia and _PROTEIN_ backgrounds showed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was repressed in _PROTEIN_ mutants like wild type during the cold but then increased during subsequent growth in warm temperatures . to ensure that this was not an effect of a mutation linked to _PROTEIN_ we tested the vernalization response of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and found that all lhp alleles were equally compromised in their ability to suppress _PROTEIN_ by vernalization . a reduction of _PROTEIN_ levels in the cold followed by increased _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is similar to that observed in the vrn mutants and suggests that _PROTEIN_ is required for _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ repression postvernalization . analysis of flowering time in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants was complicated by ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ background a floral promoter that functions downstream of _PROTEIN_ demonstrating the importance of assaying _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ rather than flowering time . _PROTEIN_ is a protein with two plant specific domains and binds dsdna non sequence specifically in vitro . chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments have shown that _PROTEIN_ is associated with _PROTEIN_ chromatin . to further analyze its in vivo dna binding properties arabidopsis transformants carrying a _METHOD_ translational fusion _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were generated . a single locus line was chosen and found to be fully functional because it could restore the vernalization response of the _PROTEIN_ flowering _PROTEIN_ fca double mutant to that of fca . in vivo _METHOD_ localized strongly and evenly throughout the nucleoplasm with very little _METHOD_ in the nucleolus and cytoplasm . examination of root tips revealed that _METHOD_ appeared to localize to all arabidopsis chromosomes remaining associated throughout mitosis . the _METHOD_ pattern in interphase cells also indicated a specific subnuclear location . to examine this finding further we performed immunodetection experiments using an antibody raised against full length _PROTEIN_ in parallel with and antibodies . the latter two are cytological marks for euchromatin and visible heterochromatin respectively . whereas labels the chromocenters the _PROTEIN_ and signals were both located outside the chromocenters . however _PROTEIN_ and showed different labeling intensities at particular locations suggesting localization at different targets within the chromosomal _METHOD_ . this localization is illustrated by the green yellow orange red pattern caused by overlay of dapi and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals . because _PROTEIN_ associates with mitotic chromosomes we investigated whether it was also associated with meiotic chromosomes by immunolocalization on chromosome spread preparations from anthers . in somatic _LOCATION_ chromocenters and nucleoli can be observed whereas in meiotic _LOCATION_ individual chromosome fibers become visible . we found that somatic cells stained strongly for _PROTEIN_ whereas no signal was detectable in meiotic _LOCATION_ at midprophase i . this condition persisted to a _PROTEIN_ stage of meiosis where the _PROTEIN_ signal was detected in somatic cells but not in microspores . this result is not due to an inability to label meiotic cells because an signal was detectable in midprophase _LOCATION_ . somatic cells such as the binucleate tapetum cells also labeled well with anti . the antibody also labeled the chromocenters of both tapetum and midprophase _LOCATION_ . analysis of subsequent pollen stages was prevented by the formation of impenetrable cell walls . the loss of _PROTEIN_ association in meiotic chromosomes could be caused by a changed localization of the protein or reduced _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . examination of the publicly available microarray data shows that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ can be detected throughout vegetative development in flowers and developing embryos but is fold lower in mature pollen . thus it _METHOD_ likely that a reduced _PROTEIN_ causes the loss of _PROTEIN_ association to meiotic chromosomes . the requirement for prolonged cold for _PROTEIN_ action on _PROTEIN_ led us to analyze whether the _METHOD_ localization was altered by vernalization . no obvious changes were detected at the level of resolution provided by confocal microscopy however this assay would not detect changes occurring at specific loci . we also addressed whether _PROTEIN_ may be recruited to its site of action by a function associated with _PROTEIN_ activity . the general chromosome association of _PROTEIN_ supports the idea that it is not an _PROTEIN_ specific regulator which also appears to be the case for _PROTEIN_ . localization of _METHOD_ was therefore analyzed in a _PROTEIN_ mutant background but no obvious difference to wild type plants was observed . _PROTEIN_ is therefore not required for the general chromosomal association of _PROTEIN_ however this assay would not detect changes occurring at specific loci . _PROTEIN_ is part of a three member gene family in the arabidopsis genome with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ in vegetative tissue whereas _PROTEIN_ function is thought to be restricted to seed development . the similar _PROTEIN_ pattern and documented functional redundancy between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ led us to test whether _METHOD_ chromosome association in seedlings was altered in a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . given the likely functional association of _PROTEIN_ with an enhancer of zeste protein we also tested _METHOD_ chromosomal association in a double mutant defective in the e homologues curly _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and swinger _PROTEIN_ clf swn . the general chromosomal association of _METHOD_ however appeared to be wild type in both _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and clf swn .
