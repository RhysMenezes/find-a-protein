the epidermal cells of the arabidopsis thaliana seed coat which correspond to the second layer of the outer integument contain large quantities of a pectic polysaccharide called mucilage within the apoplastic space beneath the outer periclinal cell wall . immediately after seed imbibition the mucilage is extruded and completely envelops the seed in a gel like capsule . we found that a class iii peroxidase family protein _PROTEIN_ functions as a mucilage extrusion _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ occurred only in cells for a few days around the torpedo stage . a _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein fusion was secreted into the outer cell wall in a _PROTEIN_ manner . _PROTEIN_ mutants were defective in mucilage extrusion after seed imbibition due to the failure of outer cell wall rupture although the mutants exhibited normal monosaccharide composition of the mucilage . this abnormal phenotype of _PROTEIN_ was rescued by pectin solubilization which promoted cell wall loosening . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ regulates the degradation of the outer cell wall . taken together this work indicates that _PROTEIN_ secretion of _PROTEIN_ in a developmental stage dependent manner plays a role in cell wall modification of cells .
previously we reported that the nac transcription _PROTEIN_ nac regulated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ regulate seed coat formation . staining of seeds with ruthenium red to visualize pectic polysaccharides revealed that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant fails to extrude mucilage suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may regulate the _PROTEIN_ of mucilage related _PROTEIN_ . the _GENE_ gene encoding _PROTEIN_ was remarkably downregulated in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ silique which contains the developing seeds . these results suggested that _PROTEIN_ is a mucilage related _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was restricted to the young silique containing the developing seeds . atgenexpress _PROTEIN_ profile analysis indicated that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ occurred in developing seeds isolated from the silique . to determine where _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in the developing seed rt pcr was performed using rna extracted from the embryo and from the remaining tissue consisting of endosperm and integument . the _PROTEIN_ transcript was not detected in the embryo but was detected in the tissue comprising endosperm and integument . the distribution pattern of transcripts of _PROTEIN_ and protodermal _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which are markers of the outer integument and embryo respectively confirmed that the tissue had been prepared correctly . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in the endosperm and/or integument . transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ gus the synthetic green _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ fusion under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter were generated to examine the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ in tissues of developing seeds . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signal was detected in the integument but not in the endosperm during the torpedo stage . higher magnification of the outer integument revealed that _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was restricted to cells whereas the _METHOD_ dye a marker of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was present in the inner cell layer of the integument including and cells . the observed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pattern indicates that _PROTEIN_ is specifically localized to cells . the protein accumulation levels of _PROTEIN_ during seed formation were investigated using _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants which were generated to _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter in the _PROTEIN_ genetic background . _METHOD_ is a modified _METHOD_ in which four consecutive gly residues are added to the c terminus to avoid mislocalization of the fusion protein to _LOCATION_ . the siliques of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were harvested at different stages ranging from d after pollination to dap and subjected to immunoblot analysis . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ emerged at dap and its accumulation reached a maximum at dap which corresponded to the torpedo stage followed by rapid degradation . thus _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was detected only for a few days during early seed formation which is different from the accumulation pattern of . in previous work we showed that accumulates until the middle stages of seed formation despite programmed cell death of the inner integument at the end of early seed formation . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ functions transiently in living cells around the torpedo stage . the molecular _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ shifted from to kd during seed development suggesting that the kd form is processed to yield the kd form . suborganellar fractionation followed by immunoblot analyses revealed that the kd form was present in the microsomal fraction whereas the kd form was present in the soluble fraction . the kd form might be generated after removal of the c terminal sequence of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . similar processing of the _METHOD_ fusions on the secretory pathway was reported previously . because the high accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is restricted to the torpedo stage its subcellular localization was examined in the cells of developing seeds at and dap using a confocal laser scanning microscope . _METHOD_ gus which is localized specifically to the _LOCATION_ was used as a control . at dap _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected in both the intra and _LOCATION_ spaces of cells . intracellular _METHOD_ was distributed throughout the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ network like structures . _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ was primarily localized to the outer periclinal cell wall which is exposed to the external environment . no _METHOD_ was observed at the inner periclinal cell wall . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ secretion is highly regulated in a _PROTEIN_ manner . accumulating _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ was still observed at dap however intracellular _METHOD_ was no longer detected . considering the developmental shift in the molecular _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the extra and intracellular _METHOD_ signals likely correspond to the and kd _METHOD_ respectively . together these results suggest that the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized kd protein is secreted into the outer cell wall of cells where the processed kd form accumulates . next two t dna insertion mutants of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were isolated . analysis of gene _PROTEIN_ confirmed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were knockdown mutants of _PROTEIN_ . toluidine blue staining of transverse sections cut from developing seeds showed normal accumulation of mucilage around the columella in the cells of _PROTEIN_ mutants similar to that observed in wild type seeds . scanning electron microscopy revealed no obvious differences in the surfaces of dry wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant seeds . these results indicate that cells develop normally in _PROTEIN_ mutants . transmission electron micrographs of transverse sections of developing seeds at dap showed no differences in the outer cell wall of the cells of wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant seeds . higher magnification images of wild type mucilage revealed the presence of a large number of highly electron dense filaments that formed a meshwork within the mucilage . however the _PROTEIN_ mutants showed a marked reduction in the number of filamentous structures giving the meshwork a rough appearance in contrast with the fine appearance in the wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . this abnormal phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutant was restored by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in cells . these results suggest that mucilage components are affected by downregulation of _PROTEIN_ . because peroxidases are known to catalyze the cross linking of cell wall components the filamentous structures might be formed by a cross linking reaction between the mucilage components in a peroxidase dependent manner . to examine mucilage extrusion from seed coat dry seeds of the wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutants were directly shaken in ruthenium red solution which stains pectic polysaccharides . approximately of wild type seeds were completely enrobed in mucilage gel _PROTEIN_ whereas showed partial extrusion of mucilage from the seed coat . by contrast in _PROTEIN_ mutants complete mucilage extrusion was rarely observed and partial mucilage extrusion occurred in of the seeds . to determine whether the abnormal mucilage extrusion of _PROTEIN_ mutants correlated with _PROTEIN_ downregulation molecular complementation studies were conducted using two independent lines of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants . immunoblotting using an anti _METHOD_ antibody showed that the transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in developing seeds at the torpedo stage as observed by the detection of the and kd bands . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ rescued the mucilage extrusion deficiency of _PROTEIN_ mutant seeds and the mucilage gel _PROTEIN_ of the transgenic plants was indistinguishable from that of wild type seeds . quantification of mucilage extrusion in seeds of the wild type _PROTEIN_ mutants and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants was achieved by staining seeds with ruthenium red solution without shaking . in this case of _PROTEIN_ mutant seeds showed complete or partial mucilage extrusion whereas to of seeds of wild type and transgenic plants showed normal or partial mucilage extrusion . taken together these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is involved in mucilage extrusion . the outer cell walls of wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant seeds were inspected under a light microscope after imbibition . seed imbibition resulted in mucilage mediated rupture of the outer cell wall in wild type seeds . by contrast the outer cell wall of _PROTEIN_ mutant seeds formed dome shaped structures that were detached from the columella these structures appeared to be caused by mucilage expansion . no obvious differences were observed between the cell walls of wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant seeds incubated in ethanol indicating that the dome shaped walls observed on the _PROTEIN_ mutant seeds were formed due to imbibition . these dome shaped outer cell walls were frequently peeled away as a large sheet by shaking the seeds possibly due to the mechanically induced collisions between the seeds . this peeling resulted in the partial extrusion of mucilage . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ mutants have rigid outer cell wall compared with that of the wild type . finally to examine the influence of pectin solubilization on mucilage extrusion in the _PROTEIN_ mutants wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant seeds were shaken in a solution containing the chelating agent edta or the weak alkali and then stained with ruthenium red . _PROTEIN_ mutant seeds showed normal mucilage extrusion similar to wild type seeds . quantification of ruthenium red staining demonstrated that treatment with edta and significantly increased mucilage extrusion in _PROTEIN_ mutant seeds . a similar result was reported for some mucilage extrusion deficient mutants . taken together these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ plays a role in mucilage extrusion by regulating the degradation of the outer cell wall of cells . the _PROTEIN_ sequence has both a catalytic and distal heme binding domain and a proximal heme binding domain that are conserved in peroxidase family proteins . this raised the question of whether _PROTEIN_ actually functions as a peroxidase . to address it we generated transgenic plants that overexpressed the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter in the _PROTEIN_ background and isolated the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein from two independent transgenic lines by affinity chromatography with anti _METHOD_ antibody . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fraction showed peroxidase activity toward the typical peroxidase substrate tetramethylbenzidine . the activities of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fractions were significantly higher than those of the control fractions that were obtained from the transgenic line _PROTEIN_ free _METHOD_ and the _PROTEIN_ mutant line . it should be noted that similar levels of activity were found in the total extract fractions from the lines examined . these results indicate that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein had a peroxidase activity suggesting that _PROTEIN_ functions as a peroxidase in cells .
