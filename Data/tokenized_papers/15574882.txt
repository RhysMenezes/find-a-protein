members of the kinesin superfamily are microtubule based motor proteins that transport molecules/organelles along microtubules . we have identified similar internal motor kinesins kinesin from the cotton gossypium hirsutum and arabidopsis thaliana . their motor domains share high degree of similarity with those of internal motor kinesins of animals and protists in the subfamily . however no significant sequence similarities were detected in sequences outside the motor domain . in arabidopsis plants carrying the t dna knockout kinesin and kinesin mutations at the kinesin locus > leaf trichomes had four branches whereas wild type trichomes had three . _METHOD_ results showed that atkinesin and ghkinesin localized to entire _LOCATION_ stacks . in both wild type and kinesin mutant cells the _LOCATION_ stacks were frequently associated with microtubules and with actin microfilaments . aggregation/clustering of _LOCATION_ stacks was often observed in the kinesin mutant trichomes and other epidermal cells . this suggested that the distribution of the _LOCATION_ apparatus in cell cortex might require microtubules and kinesin and the organization of _LOCATION_ stacks could play a regulatory role in trichome morphogenesis . our results also indicate that plant kinesins in the mcak/kinesin subfamily have evolved to take on different tasks than their animal counterparts .
in an analysis of kinesins that were abundantly _PROTEIN_ in cotton fiber growth a base pair cdna was isolated that encoded a kinesin of amino acids with a calculated molecular _METHOD_ of da and an isoelectric point of . a similar kinesin is encoded by the _GENE_ gene in arabidopsis . a full length cdna sequence of _GENE_ was determined with an est clone from the kazusa dna research institute . this cdna sequence encodes a polypeptide of amino acids with a calculated molecular _METHOD_ of da and an isoelectric point of . because these two kinesins have their motor domains located in the middle of the polypeptides they were named as ghkinesin for g. hirsutum/a . thaliana kinesin . this name is adopted based on a recent agreement on the kinesin nomenclature . ghkinesin and atkinesin share sequence identity across the entire polypeptides . the motor domains of amino acids and amino acids for ghkinesin and atkinesin respectively have identity . to reveal how these polypeptides relate to other kinesins we first analyzed their highly conserved motor domains . a phylogenetic analysis of representative members of the kinesin superfamily showed that ghkinesin and atkinesin were placed into the mcak/kinesin subfamily . to date all nonplant kinesins in the mcak/kinesin subfamily have internal motor domains and outside the motor domain they are closely related to each other . however sequence similarity between the plant kinesin and animal mcak/kinesin was only limited to their motor domains . according to the lupas algorithm ghkinesin and atkinesin have predicted coiled coil regions of amino acid and respectively toward their c termini . we did not detect any other structural or functional motif/domain in kinesin nor did we detect the signature neck sequence which is critical for the microtubule depolymerization activities for animal mcak/kinesin . to understand the function of kinesin we isolated t dna insertional mutations at the kinesin locus in arabidopsis . two independent t dna insertional mutations kinesin and kinesin have been confirmed at intron and exon . compared with wild type plants homozygous kinesin and kinesin plants did not exhibit obvious growth phenotype in seed germination root and shoot formation and flowering . the mutant leaves however had abnormal trichomes . in wild type plants trichomes normally had two branching points with three branches . in the kinesin homozygous mutant trichomes predominantly had four to five branches . similar trichome phenotypes were observed in the kinesin homozygous mutant . to determine how such abnormal trichomes were formed in the mutants we analyzed trichomes at different developmental stages . after initial cell elongation typical wild type trichomes form three branches via the primary and secondary branching events . in kinesin mutants both these branching events were clearly present . however at least one and occasionally two additional branches were formed after the second branching event . we quantified branching patterns in wild type and kinesin mutants . five rosette leaves were taken from each plant . the wild type trichomes predominantly had three branches . although occasionally four branches were found the number was minimal . in both kinesin and kinesin mutants and trichomes had four branches respectively . some of the mutant trichomes even had five branches . therefore we concluded that the morphology of mutant trichomes was significantly different from that of the wild type . segregation analysis of progeny from a cross between homozygous kinesin mutant and a wild type columbia plant also was performed . our results indicated that the kinesin mutation was recessive and the trichome branching phenotype was mapped to a single locus . furthermore genetic complementation analysis of kinesin and kinesin showed that these two mutations are allelic . the results collectively suggested that defects in trichome morphology were caused by the inactivation of the kinesin gene . to further confirm that loss of atkinesin caused the trichome defects we carried out genetic suppression experiments with the atkinesin cdna . homozygous kinesin plants were transformed with atkinesin cdna under the control of the promoter . transformants had majority of trichomes with restored three branch morphology and the number of such trichome matched that in wild type . together we concluded that mutations at the kinesin locus caused defects in trichome morphology . to understand how kinesin affects cell growth we determined its intracellular localization . affinity purified anti atkinesin antibodies were used to detect atkinesin in arabidopsis . the antibodies detected a band with kda by immunoblotting with wild type protein extracts . when protein extracts of homozygous kinesin and kinesin were probed with identical antibodies under identical conditions no band was detected in the region of the similar molecular _METHOD_ . two weaker bands at the kda region also were detected in wild type extract but not in either mutant extract . thus they were most likely the degradation products of atkinesin . an anti tubulin antibody was used in a positive control experiment and the tubulin band was revealed in all samples . the results suggested that the antibodies specifically recognized atkinesin as a kda band in the wild type extract . based on more than ests atkinesin rna _METHOD_ to be present in young and mature seedlings and leaves and roots . therefore we initially localized atkinesin in root meristematic cells by _METHOD_ . figure a and b show that anti atkinesin antibodies detected particles smaller than in the cytoplasm . the same antibodies did not react with particles in the cytoplasm of kinesin cells demonstrating the specificity of the antibodies . atkinesin might be specifically associated with an organelle . antibodies also were prepared against ghkinesin . affinity purified anti ghkinesin antibodies recognized a band of kda . when the antibodies were used to detect ghkinesin in cotton fibers organelles similar to those in arabidopsis cells were detected . therefore it is likely that kinesin proteins from these two different plants are associated with similar organelles . the anti kinesin antibody staining pattern most closely reflected the size and distribution of the _LOCATION_ apparatus . therefore we asked whether kinesin was indeed associated with the _LOCATION_ apparatus . it has been reported that a fusion protein of the transmembrane domain of a rat sialyl transferase _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ decorates _LOCATION_ stacks in plant cells . to visualize the _LOCATION_ apparatus we used an arabidopsis line _PROTEIN_ this fusion protein . protoplasts isolated from leaf mesophyll cells were used to discern the relationship between atkinesin localization and individual _LOCATION_ stacks marked by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . figure a and b respectively showed _METHOD_ with anti atkinesin antibodies and the anti _METHOD_ antibody . as shown in figure merging of the two images suggest that atkinesin is localized to the _LOCATION_ stacks . the intensity of anti atkinesin staining and the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal varied among some _LOCATION_ stacks . the significance of such variation is not clear . because an association of kinesins with entire _LOCATION_ stacks has not been reported we used rabbit antibodies against mannosidase to obtain additional evidence . mannosidase has been previously reported as an endogenous _LOCATION_ marker . because anti ghkinesin antibodies were raised in rats dual localization experiments were carried out in cytoplasts isolated from cotton fibers to clearly distinguish individual _LOCATION_ stacks . the cytoplasm of cotton fibers had numerous _LOCATION_ stacks as detected by the anti mannosidase antibodies . similar anti ghkinesin staining pattern also was observed . as shown in a pseudocolored merged image in figure _LOCATION_ stacks labeled with anti mannosidase also were decorated by anti ghkinesin . therefore we concluded that ghkinesin decorated the _LOCATION_ stacks in cotton fibers as seen in arabidopsis cells . to rule out that kinesin may be associated with other abundant organelles we used an anti salicylic acid binding protein antibody _PROTEIN_ that specifically detects _LOCATION_ . _LOCATION_ labeled by anti _PROTEIN_ were much smaller and had different distribution pattern than that of kinesin in arabidopsis root cells . therefore we concluded that atkinesin and ghkinesin represented a new class of plant kinesins that were associated specifically with the _LOCATION_ apparatus in both arabidopsis and cotton cells . other studies suggest that the motility of plant _LOCATION_ only relies on actin microfilaments . because we showed that a microtubule based motor was clearly associated with the _LOCATION_ apparatus we also wanted to test whether the plant _LOCATION_ apparatus was associated with microtubules . because kinesin mutations caused defects in leaves we carried out simultaneous observation of microtubules and _LOCATION_ stacks in live cells of arabidopsis leaves . cortical microtubules were observed in leaf epidermal cells stably _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tubulin . because both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and nag _METHOD_ indistinguishably decorate _LOCATION_ stacks we chose nag _METHOD_ to label the _LOCATION_ apparatus as the nag sequence was from arabidopsis . when nag _METHOD_ was transiently _PROTEIN_ by particle bombardment _LOCATION_ stacks were labeled as particles throughout the cytoplasm . some _LOCATION_ stacks were found to be associated along the cortical microtubule network although not all _LOCATION_ stacks were attached to microtubules . similar association of _LOCATION_ stacks labeled by anti ghkinesin with cortical microtubules was also observed in cytoplasts isolated from cotton fibers . to further confirm that the _LOCATION_ microtubule association was not an artifact caused by chemical fixation or other means we examined cells preserved by rapid freeze and freeze substitution under an electron microscope . a close association between a _LOCATION_ stack and a microtubule was observed . thus our observation of the possible association of _LOCATION_ stacks with cytoplasmic microtubules in vivo is consistent with the notion that a novel kinesin mediates the functional association of the two components . we also determined whether the _LOCATION_ apparatus was associated with microfilaments . a _METHOD_ talin fusion protein had been shown to label actin microfilaments in live cells . among leaf epidermal cells _PROTEIN_ both _METHOD_ talin and nag _METHOD_ fusions a number of _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ stacks were associated with the _METHOD_ microfilaments . however some _LOCATION_ stacks did not show a close association with microfilaments . therefore we conclude that in plant cells the _LOCATION_ apparatus is capable of interacting with both microtubules and microfilaments . because kinesin mutations affect the branching pattern of trichomes in arabidopsis we wondered whether the distribution of _LOCATION_ stacks was different in mutant trichomes compared with those of wild type . nag _METHOD_ was stably _PROTEIN_ in the wild type and kinesin mutation backgrounds which revealed _LOCATION_ stacks in leaf cells including trichomes . although we were able to image _LOCATION_ stacks in trichomes by confocal microscopy it was impossible to superimpose the optical sections of whole trichomes as _LOCATION_ stacks moved rapidly inside the trichomes so that different sections reflected _LOCATION_ distribution patterns at different time points . thus only single optical sections are presented here . in wild type trichomes _LOCATION_ stacks distributed more or less loosely in the cortex in the trichome stalk as well as branches . the kinesin trichomes also contained numerous _LOCATION_ stacks in the cortical cytoplasm . the mutant trichomes consistently showed _LOCATION_ aggregation phenomenon . this result suggested to us that this additional aggregation event might lead to the formation of the fourth branch in mutant trichomes . we also carried out immunolocalization of the _LOCATION_ apparatus and microtubules in other leaf epidermal cells in both wild type and the kinesin mutant . anti mannosidase _METHOD_ revealed discrete particles of _LOCATION_ stacks in both wild type and kinesin mutant cells . networks of cortical microtubules were revealed by anti tubulin _METHOD_ and no obvious difference was detected between wild type and mutant cells . merged images were shown in figure c and f. in wild type cells the _LOCATION_ stacks were evenly distributed throughout the cortical cytoplasm where cortical microtubules were present . in kinesin cells _LOCATION_ stacks also were largely dispersed across the cytoplasm . however in mutant cells one or more aggregates of _LOCATION_ stacks were found in mutant epidermal cells . the distribution pattern also was analyzed quantitatively by measuring anti _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ intensity in randomly chosen areas in figure a and d. the result of the measurement is presented in table . more areas in the kinesin mutant were distributed toward highest intensities and lowest intensities than those in the wild type cells . consistent with the observation that _LOCATION_ stacks seemed more clumped in the mutant and the observed distribution of pixel counts the pixel count variance was times higher in the kinesin mutant than in wild type . therefore this result suggested that a significant difference in the distribution of _LOCATION_ stacks occurred between the two samples . similar phenomenon was also observed with independent samples . we also examined whether _LOCATION_ microtubule association was dependent on the atkinesin protein . the _LOCATION_ apparatus was still found in frequent association with cortical microtubules in the kinesin mutant . we also examined the motility of _LOCATION_ stacks in both wild type and mutant cells . when nag _METHOD_ was transiently and stably _PROTEIN_ in leaf epidermal cells and trichomes _LOCATION_ stacks were labeled across the cytoplasm in both wild type and mutant cells . in both wild type and mutant cells certain _LOCATION_ stacks were found to undergo rapid movement at a rate of several micrometers per second . other _LOCATION_ stacks however remained stationary . this is consistent with the report of a maximum velocity of for some _LOCATION_ stacks in tobacco cells . we were not able to detect any difference in the velocity of _LOCATION_ motility between wild type and mutant cells . thus we conclude that kinesin does not contribute to the primary movement of the _LOCATION_ apparatus in plant cells .
