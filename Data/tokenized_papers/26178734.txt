vascular tissues are very important for providing both mechanical strength and transport . the molecular _METHOD_ of regulation of vascular tissue development are still not fully understood . in this study we identified _PROTEIN_ as a _LOCATION_ nac family transcription _PROTEIN_ that regulates vascular tissue development . reporter gene assays showed that _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the vascular tissues . increased _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ protein in transgenic arabidopsis caused dwarf phenotype reduced xylem differentiation _PROTEIN_ lignin content repression of a lignin biosynthetic gene and genes related to cambium and primary wall but activation of genes related to the secondary wall . _PROTEIN_ of a dominant repressor fusion of _PROTEIN_ had overall the opposite effects on vascular tissue differentiation and lignin synthetic gene _PROTEIN_ . the _METHOD_ fusion protein was localized at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ whereas deletion of the last amino acids which are mostly basic caused its _LOCATION_ localization . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is a cell _LOCATION_ transcription _PROTEIN_ that inhibits xylem tissue development in arabidopsis .
_PROTEIN_ is a nac gene preferentially _PROTEIN_ in xylem according to a tissue specific microarray analysis . we first performed quantitative reverse chain reaction to examine the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in different arabidopsis tissues and organs . _PROTEIN_ was ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ at a similar level in seedlings roots and rosette leaves of plants stem of plants and other organs of plants . to further investigate the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ a kb genomic sequence including kb promoter region and the kb coding region was fused to the escherichia coli reporter gene and transformed into arabidopsis . as shown in figure b h the _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants showed gus activity in the vascular system of the cotyledons rosette leaves petioles and inflorescence stem . a section of the inflorescence stem shows the highest gus signal in the cells adjacent to the _PROTEIN_ tracheary elements in xylem . no gus signal was observed in the mature tracheary elements suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is highly _PROTEIN_ during tracheary element development . weak gus signals were also observed in the phloem cells of vascular tissue . gus _PROTEIN_ was also detected preferentially in vascular tissues of cauline leaves _PROTEIN_ and stigma . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the vascular tissues of all organs in arabidopsis . these results are consistent with the reported microarray result showing that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ at a higher level in xylem compared with phloem and system . _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ preferentially in

subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ we made an _METHOD_ _METHOD_ fusion protein construct driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter and transformed it into nicotiana benthamiana . in the epidermal cells of nicotiana benthamiana transformed with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was visible in both _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm . by contrast the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was only detected at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . protein structure analysis showed that the of _PROTEIN_ has a _PROTEIN_ domain including a b c d and e motifs its is a putative transcription regulation domain . _PROTEIN_ does not belong to the nac proteins previously identified as putatively mtfs . we further examined the _PROTEIN_ sequence using the program and identified a putative transmembrane motif in the middle region . in order to test whether the putative tm motif determines the localization of _PROTEIN_ we made several truncated _PROTEIN_ proteins fused with _METHOD_ protein . when _PROTEIN_ in nicotiana benthamiana driven by the camv promoter _METHOD_ was localized exclusively at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in contrast _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were all localized in the _LOCATION_ . however deletion of the amino acids resulted in localization in both _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . these results show that amino acids of _PROTEIN_ play an important role in its localization of to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ whereas the region specifies _LOCATION_ localization . subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ protein

plasmolysis of nicotiana benthamiana leaf epidermal cells transformed with _METHOD_ . yellow arrows marker the places where plasmolysis happen . the _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants showed dwarf phenotypes with round rosette leaves and the severity of phenotypes correlated with the intensities of gus staining indicating that _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ caused the dwarf phenotypes . the pattern of gus staining however remained the same in lines that showed different levels of gus and phenotype severity . similar dwarf phenotypes were observed in transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ fusion proteins but the _PROTEIN_ appeared to cause milder phenotypes compared to the gus and _METHOD_ fusions . compared with wild type plants the transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ high levels of _PROTEIN_ have shorter petiole and oval leaves . scanning electron microscopy _PROTEIN_ analysis showed the cell elongation is reduced in _METHOD_ transgenic plants . furthermore the _METHOD_ transgenic plants show a bigger angle between inflorescence stem and pedicle . when _PROTEIN_ using the camv promoter _PROTEIN_ causes similar dwarf phenotypes as driven by _PROTEIN_ promoter . increasing _PROTEIN_

repressor method to study _PROTEIN_ function _PROTEIN_ . coding sequence of _PROTEIN_ was fused to the _PROTEIN_ transcription repression domain _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in transgenic arabidopsis using the camv promoter . to our surprise the _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants show no obvious morphological phenotype . since _PROTEIN_ is preferentially _PROTEIN_ in the vascular bundle we investigated whether _PROTEIN_ regulates vascular development . we performed sectioning and microscopic analysis of the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants . as shown in figure a d the _PROTEIN_ plants showed reduced xylem differentiation whereas the _PROTEIN_ plants showed increased xylem development . consistent with the altered xylem development the lignin content was increased in the _PROTEIN_ plants but reduced in the _PROTEIN_ plants . _PROTEIN_ inhibits xylem differentiation transverse sections of the basal portion of the inflorescence _METHOD_ of wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants

involved in lignin synthesis from plants and genes related to vascular development from stem of plants of wild type and transgenic plants . we further analyzed genes in the inflorescence stem of the transgenic plants by . these genes include lignin synthesis genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cambium marker _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ phloem marker _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ primary cell wall cellulose synthesis genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and secondary cell wall cellulose synthesis genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . as shown in figure f _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was highly increased in the _PROTEIN_ plants but _PROTEIN_ in two _METHOD_ lines consistent with the alteration of lignin content and xylem development in these plants . _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were also increased in the _PROTEIN_ plants but not obviously altered in the _METHOD_ plants . all these results support that _PROTEIN_ regulates lignin synthesis and xylem differentiation . interestingly genes related to cambium phloem and primary cell wall were downregulated while genes related to the secondary cell wall were upregulated in the _METHOD_ plants compared to wild type .
