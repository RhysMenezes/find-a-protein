gibberellins are plant hormones involved in the regulation of plant growth in response to endogenous and environmental signals . ga promotes growth by stimulating the degradation of _LOCATION_ growth repressing della proteins . in arabidopsis thaliana dellas consist of a small family of five proteins that display distinct but also overlapping functions in repressing ga responses . this study reveals that della _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein is essential to fully enhance the jasmonate mediated responses . we show that ja rapidly induces _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and jasmonate _PROTEIN_ dependent manner . in addition we demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ binds directly to _PROTEIN_ promoter . furthermore we show that _PROTEIN_ interacts with ja _PROTEIN_ domain proteins key repressors of ja signaling . these findings suggest that dependent accumulation of _PROTEIN_ represses jaz activity which in turn enhances the _PROTEIN_ of ja responsive genes . accordingly we show that induction of primary ja responsive genes is reduced in the _PROTEIN_ mutant and enhanced in transgenic lines overexpressing _PROTEIN_ . hence _PROTEIN_ positively regulates ja mediated resistance to the necrotroph botrytis cinerea and susceptibility to the hemibiotroph pseudomonas syringae . we propose that ja mediated induction of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is of _PROTEIN_ significance and might represent a recent functional diversification of the dellas .
to address the biological function of _PROTEIN_ we first surveyed its _PROTEIN_ pattern using the _PROTEIN_ ii network drawer which predicts regulatory networks based on coexpressed genes determined from public microarray analyses . bioinformatics study revealed that _PROTEIN_ is tightly coregulated with ja related genes including jazs _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ thus suggesting that ja regulates _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to confirm these data we analyzed by quantitative rt pcr the induction kinetics of the five arabidopsis della genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in d old seedlings treated with of methyl jasmonate . we found that ja transiently induced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ reaching its maximum induction after h of ja treatment . della proteins are subject to destabilization in the presence of ga . thus we assessed whether ja mediated transient induction of _PROTEIN_ was accompanied by an increase in _PROTEIN_ protein accumulation . to this end we generated a translational fusion with the full length _PROTEIN_ cdna fused to the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ open reading frame downstream of the _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . by protein gel blotting using an anti _METHOD_ antibody we found that ja rapidly enhanced the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein in d old _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic seedlings . furthermore the level of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulation was _PROTEIN_ over h of ja treatment . to visualize in planta the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ proteins we next generated a line _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ translational fusion driven by the _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ . in week old plants trace levels of _PROTEIN_ gus were visible only in the shoot apices . in the presence of ja _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ was elevated throughout the plant _PROTEIN_ in the petiole and the vasculature of the leaves . thus ja induces _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ rapidly and broadly within the plant . next to investigate whether ja modulated the ga mediated degradation of _PROTEIN_ proteins we examined the half life of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the presence of cycloheximide a chemical blocking protein synthesis . as previously reported the level of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins was significantly reduced h after chx treatment and the kinetic of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ degradation was accelerated in the presence of of gibberellic acid _PROTEIN_ . ja alone or combined with _PROTEIN_ did slightly delay the kinetics of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ degradation in comparison with the controls in the absence and presence of _PROTEIN_ respectively . however we showed that ja did not statistically alter the content of the biologically active ga _PROTEIN_ . thus overall these results indicate that ja rapidly enhances _PROTEIN_ protein accumulation essentially via induction of the gene transcripts . ja activates ja responses by stimulating the dependent degradation of the jaz proteins thereby releasing _PROTEIN_ to promote ja induced gene _PROTEIN_ . here we demonstrated that ja induced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ works via the _PROTEIN_ dependent signaling pathway . loss of function _PROTEIN_ confers stabilization of jazs and impairs responsiveness to ja . we found that ja mediated induction of _PROTEIN_ was abolished in the _PROTEIN_ mutant indicating that _PROTEIN_ is downstream of _PROTEIN_ . we next investigated the responsiveness of _PROTEIN_ to ja in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . we found that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was partially insensitive to ja . the arabidopsis genome encodes two close _PROTEIN_ homologs _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which have an additive effect on the activation of the ja responses . as in the _PROTEIN_ mutant ja mediated induction of _PROTEIN_ was significantly impaired in the _PROTEIN_ mutant and to a lesser extent in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . in addition the responsiveness of _PROTEIN_ to ja was completely impaired in the triple _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant . altogether these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ proteins act redundantly in the activation of _PROTEIN_ in response to ja . _PROTEIN_ proteins are bhlh transcriptional _PROTEIN_ that specifically bind to g box or g box like motifs . we found five g box related motifs within the kb promoter of _PROTEIN_ . to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ binds directly to the _PROTEIN_ promoter we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation _PROTEIN_ with the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic line described previously . after immunoprecipitation of protein dna complexes using an antibody against the _PROTEIN_ epitope enriched dna sequences were amplified by quantitative pcr using primers that annealed near the g box like motifs present in the _PROTEIN_ promoter . a genomic fragment of was also amplified as a negative control and the promoter of _PROTEIN_ was amplified as a positive control . we performed _PROTEIN_ assays on plants that had been treated for h with of meja to induce _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . as shown in figure we found an enrichment of the region of the _PROTEIN_ promoter indicating that _PROTEIN_ is a direct target of _PROTEIN_ . to confirm the specificity of the _PROTEIN_ antibody we also performed _PROTEIN_ assays on nontransgenic _PROTEIN_ mutant and we did not find an enrichment of the same promoter region by qpcr . to validate further the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with the _PROTEIN_ promoter we next conducted a dna electrophoretic mobility shift assay _METHOD_ with a recombinant maltose binding protein _PROTEIN_ protein produced in escherichia coli and affinity purified . we found that mbp _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins were able to bind a dna probe containing the cacatg g box like motif located near the region of the _PROTEIN_ promoter . furthermore unlabeled dna probes competed for binding in a dose dependent manner but the dna probes containing the mutant form of the cacatg motif did not . together these results reveal that _PROTEIN_ regulates _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ through a direct association with its promoter . recent studies reported the interaction of the della proteins with jaz proteins providing a mechanism by which dellas contribute to ja signaling . by _METHOD_ lifetime imaging microscopy analysis of _LOCATION_ in transiently transformed nicotiana benthamiana cells we showed the direct interaction of _PROTEIN_ with two phylogenetically distant jaz _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with a _METHOD_ resonance energy transfer of and respectively . we also showed the direct interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ by yeast two hybrid assays . this _PROTEIN_ result contrasts with those from citation who did not observe an interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in yeast . moreover coimmunoprecipitation studies further confirmed an in vivo interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ and with _PROTEIN_ . taken together our results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ interacts in planta with various jaz proteins and therefore suggest that ja mediated induction of _PROTEIN_ transcripts is critical to enhance the ja responses . to investigate further the biological function of _PROTEIN_ we identified a new _PROTEIN_ mutant allele hereafter called _PROTEIN_ . we speculated that lack of _PROTEIN_ activity would reduce or delay the induction of _PROTEIN_ dependent gene _PROTEIN_ . to test this hypothesis we compared the kinetics of induction of typical _PROTEIN_ regulated genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in week old wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants treated with ja . we found that the _PROTEIN_ mutant exhibited reduced induction levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts in comparison with the wild type . thus _PROTEIN_ is essential to fully enhance ja induced _PROTEIN_ dependent gene _PROTEIN_ . consistent with this result overexpression of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constitutively enhanced the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in comparison with the wild type . thus ja enhances _PROTEIN_ transcriptional activity by a dual mechanism . first ja stimulates the dependent degradation of the jazs thus releasing _PROTEIN_ transcriptional activity . second ja _PROTEIN_ enhances the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ which in turn sequesters jazs into inactive complexes unable to restrain _PROTEIN_ transcriptional activity . this second regulatory mechanism is likely to play a prominent role in modulating the activity of the jazs that are relatively resistant to ja mediated degradation such as _PROTEIN_ . the ja signaling pathway _METHOD_ a critical role in plant defense . ja is the major signaling molecule implicated in plant resistance to necrotrophic pathogens . for example mutants impaired in ja production exhibit enhanced susceptibility to the necrotrophic fungus b. cinerea . to address the biological role of _PROTEIN_ in ja mediated plant defense responses we first examined the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ in rosette leaves of week old plants inoculated with b. cinerea spores over a time course experiment . we found that _PROTEIN_ was broadly induced and accumulated throughout the leaves to h after inoculation . next we assessed whether _PROTEIN_ modulates ja dependent plant defense responses . to this end we inoculated leaves of week old wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants with b. cinerea spores and examined disease _METHOD_ d after inoculation . _PROTEIN_ mutant plants were found to be more susceptible to b. cinerea because they presented larger lesions compared with wild type infected plants . consistent with this the increased severity of the disease _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants correlated with increased pathogen content . finally we monitored the kinetics of ja responsive gene induction _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ in wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants inoculated with b. cinerea . all the ja responsive genes tested displayed _PROTEIN_ induction rates in _PROTEIN_ infected plants compared with wild type infected plants . thus _PROTEIN_ enhances ja dependent plant defense responses to necrotrophic pathogens . we also analyzed the biological function of _PROTEIN_ in response to infection by the hemibiotrophic pathogen p. syringae pv tomato . contrary to necrotrophic pathogens which activate the ja pathway and trigger a strong defense response pst produces a ja mimicking phytotoxin coronatine _PROTEIN_ which can induce a set of ja responsive genes to promote susceptibility . as expected we found that pst induced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in leaves d after inoculation . conversely _PROTEIN_ was not induced by a p. syringae strain defective in _PROTEIN_ synthesis _PROTEIN_ thus indicating that p. syringae uses the _PROTEIN_ dependent pathway to modulate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we then analyzed whether the loss of function _PROTEIN_ mutation altered resistance to p. syringae . infected _PROTEIN_ plants displayed an fold reduction in bacterial growth at d after inoculation compared with wild type infected plants . consistent with this no significant difference in bacterial growth was observed between _PROTEIN_ and wild type infected plants with the _PROTEIN_ deficient pst _PROTEIN_ strain . sa is the _PROTEIN_ signaling molecule involved in plant resistance to p. syringae . because the sa pathway is antagonistic to the ja pathway we tested whether the increased resistance of the _PROTEIN_ mutant to pst correlated with a hyperinduction of sa dependent defense genes and a suppression of ja dependent gene _PROTEIN_ respectively . we found that sa dependent _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transcripts displayed stronger induction in infected leaves of _PROTEIN_ versus the wild type indicating that _PROTEIN_ represses the sa pathway . conversely the induction of ja dependent gene _PROTEIN_ including _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was severely compromised in _PROTEIN_ infected leaves in comparison with wild type infected leaves . altogether these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ modulates plant defense to pathogens via its positive regulation of ja signaling .
