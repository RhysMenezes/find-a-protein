the development of the root apex is determined by progress of cells from the meristematic region to the successive post mitotic developmental zones for transition cell elongation and final cell differentiation . we addressed root development tissue architecture and root developmental zonation by means of light sheet microscopic imaging of arabidopsis thaliana seedlings _PROTEIN_ end binding protein _PROTEIN_ fused to green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ under control of native _PROTEIN_ promoter . unlike the other two members of the family plant specific _PROTEIN_ shows prominent _LOCATION_ localization in non dividing cells in all developmental zones of the root apex . the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ was previously mentioned solely in meristematic cells but not further addressed . with the help of advanced light sheet microscopy we report quantitative evaluations of developmentally regulated _LOCATION_ levels of the _PROTEIN_ protein tagged with _METHOD_ relatively to the _LOCATION_ size in diverse root tissues and root developmental zones . our results demonstrate a high potential of light sheet microscopy for live imaging of _METHOD_ labeled _LOCATION_ in complex samples such as developing roots showing capacity to quantify parameters at deeper cell layers with minimal aberrations . the data presented herein further signify the unique role of developmental cell reprogramming in the transition from cell proliferation to cell differentiation in developing root apex .
we studied the in vivo subcellular _LOCATION_ localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein during root development in stably transformed arabidopsis thaliana plants . beside the already published presence of _LOCATION_ localization sequence in _PROTEIN_ protein sequence our in silico search using netnes prediction server revealed the occurrence of putative _LOCATION_ export signals at positions and for _PROTEIN_ . at the same respect we compared the other family members in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . nes was not predicted for _PROTEIN_ while for _PROTEIN_ there is one prediction at position albeit with a low score over the threshold . we prepared _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct driven by its own promoter . the bp long promoter sequence and the complete coding region of _PROTEIN_ gene were cloned using technology into the binary vector and subsequently transformed into a. thaliana plants while generation of plants was used for experiments . to prove the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein in the plants we performed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with subsequent western blot analysis using seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and col as a negative control . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein signal was clearly detected using anti _METHOD_ antibody at the molecular _METHOD_ corresponding to kda which is the predicted size of the fusion protein . as negative controls we used extracts from untransformed wild type plants as well as extracts from plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ treated only with secondary antibody . characterization of transgenic arabidopsis thaliana plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ driven by _PROTEIN_ own promoter and localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ followed by western blot analysis using anti _METHOD_ antibody from protein extract of a. thaliana plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein extract from untransformed col plants and protein extract from arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ immunoblotted only with secondary antibody . general overview of the root tip of days old a. thaliana seedling _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . average root zonation into individual cell developmental zones consisting meristematic zone transition zone elongation zone and differentiation zone is depicted . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized in _LOCATION_ of root cells with particularly strong _PROTEIN_ level in cells of the root meristematic zone . live cell imaging of seedling growing inside of the light sheet microscope over the period of h. localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ by light sheet microscopy in cells of individual root tissue layers in epidermis cortex endodermis central cylinder and _PROTEIN_ root cap cells . in all imaged tissues light sheet microscopy revealed clearly _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in root cells . localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ by light sheet microscopy during mitotic cell division of root cells in the meristematic zone . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ relocated from _PROTEIN_ stage _LOCATION_ to spindle in prophase metaphase and anaphase to phragmoplast at early and _PROTEIN_ telophase and redistributed back to reconstructed _PROTEIN_ stage _LOCATION_ after cell division . time progression of the cell division is indicated in min . scale bar in and in . root growth and development require passage of root cells through successive developmental zones . large extend of this process from spatial and temporal point of view requires special microscopic applications for effective live cell imaging . developmental light sheet microscopy overcomes these limitations and allows real time or time lapse imaging of whole developing seedlings . we performed live cell imaging with seedlings growing over a period between and h inside the light sheet microscope . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized in _LOCATION_ of all non dividing root cells within the root apex with particularly strong _PROTEIN_ level in cells of the root meristematic zone . general overview of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ roots revealed zonation of the root apex into different cell developmental zones namely into meristematic transition elongation and differentiation zones . seedlings were prepared and cultivated in cylinders of phytagel solidified culture medium . during imaging over a range of several hours seedlings exhibited undisturbed continuous root growth inside of the microscope . average root growth rate of days old seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the light sheet microscope was . light sheet microscopy in addition to time lapse imaging of the entire root development allowed localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at the cellular and subcellular levels . at the level of cellular resolution this method was suitable for visualization not only surface cells and tissues of the root like _PROTEIN_ root cap cells and epidermis but further allowed visualization of individual cells from inner tissues of the arabidopsis root including the cortex the endodermis and the central cylinder . in all imaged tissues light sheet microscopy revealed clearly _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in root cells . subcellular resolution of the light sheet microscopy was documented during mitotic cell division of root cells in the meristematic zone where _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ relocated from _PROTEIN_ stage _LOCATION_ to mitotic spindles and cytokinetic phragmoplasts during the respective cell division stages and finally was redistributed back to reconstituted _PROTEIN_ stage _LOCATION_ after completing cell division . the longitudinal developmental zonation of the root apex of plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein into different developmental zones was determined in individual cell files of epidermis cortex and endodermis . the cell arrangement in the meristematic zone of the epidermis was influenced by frequent cell divisions rather than by cell elongation . this leads to generation of tightly packed wide but very short cells with compressed _LOCATION_ . very similar cell and _LOCATION_ shapes were observed within the meristematic zone in the cortex layer . in the endodermis _LOCATION_ of cells in the meristematic zone appeared smaller and due to different ratio between cell width and cell height their shape was not deformed to the same extent as in the epidermis and the cortex . with termination of the mitotic activity in the meristematic zone cell sizes and shapes were changing . at the end of the meristematic zone _LOCATION_ became round and larger in all three layers . before starting rapid cell elongation however there was a population of cells with short length as indicated by short and similar distance between _LOCATION_ of individual cells . in addition they showed reduction in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ intensity . based on these characteristics an onset of the transition zone placed before rapid cell elongation could be identified in each cell file of epidermis cortex and endodermis . cells from the transition zone of each tissue layer entered subsequently cell elongation zone which was indicated by further changes in the _LOCATION_ size _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ intensity and apparent dilatation of distances between neighbor _LOCATION_ within the cell files . rapid cell elongation was connected with apparent enlargement of _LOCATION_ in epidermis and cortex changes in _LOCATION_ shape in all three tissue layers and further reduction in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ intensity . shoot ward developmental zonation in the root apex of transgenic arabidopsis thaliana plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein . cell arrangement and position were assessed in individual cell files of epidermis cortex and endodermis . typical appearance of cells in each tissue layer with _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is shown for meristematic zone at the meristem transition zone border at the transition zone elongation zone border and within the elongation zone . arrows define _LOCATION_ of first cell within the transition zone and first cell within the elongation zone . _METHOD_ intensity of images is presented to the scale recorded during the acquisition of each individual cell type . scale bar . to characterize the distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the apex of arabidopsis root in detail we quantified the intensity of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ in the previously defined root cell developmental zones . the quantitative evaluation of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein content in interphase _LOCATION_ of root cells was performed in light sheet images acquired in modes . in individual cell files of the epidermis the cortex and the endodermis all interphase _LOCATION_ in order were taken into account starting from the stem cell niche region and progressing up to cell elongation before cells reached the zone of cell differentiation . in each cell file the zone border and the transition zone border were identified . parameters for identification of particular borders and range of individual cell developmental zones included the spatial extent of the cell division size and _METHOD_ intensity reference values from _LOCATION_ of cells in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ stages increase in the _LOCATION_ size after termination of the cell division and increase in the distance between _LOCATION_ of individual cells in the elongation zone . thus all cells in each cell file were topologically divided into meristematic zone transition zone and elongation zone . values of _LOCATION_ surface area and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mean signal intensity for quantitative evaluation were plotted against cell position counted from the stem cells surrounding quiescence center . both parameters were measured and evaluated separately for the epidermis the cortex and the endodermis . we found that in all tissues as cells proceeded from proliferation to the differentiation the _LOCATION_ surface area increased while _METHOD_ intensity of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal _PROTEIN_ . this trend was apparent from quantification of individual cell files of the epidermis the cortex and the endodermis . in the meristematic zone actively dividing cells contained the smallest _LOCATION_ exhibiting the highest _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ content . in the transition zone the mean _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ intensity of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was steeply _PROTEIN_ . this decline in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ intensity continued in the elongation zone while the _LOCATION_ area progressively increased . cross correlation of _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mean signal intensity of some individual _LOCATION_ with their size and shape at certain position within the cell file revealed negative correlation between _LOCATION_ size and mean _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal intensity in the meristematic zone . this negative correlation trend was stabilized in the transition zone and the elongation zone of all measured cell files in all evaluated tissue layers as evidenced by the continuous _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ intensity with the progressive increase in _LOCATION_ size . _LOCATION_ surface area and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mean signal intensity distribution in root developmental zones of the root apex in individual cell files . relationship between _LOCATION_ area and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mean signal intensity in respect to cell position counted from the stem cells surrounding quiescent center in individual cell file of epidermis cortex and endodermis . values for _LOCATION_ in the transition zone are highlighted by yellow points which allow distinguishing also meristematic zone and elongation zone . inset images over the lines show individual _LOCATION_ of cells at the actual position documenting changes in _LOCATION_ shape size and mean _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ intensity . major vertical axis represents the values for the normalized mean intensity and minor vertical axis represents values for area measurements . horizontal axis represents the actual cell position counted from the stem cells surrounding quiescent center . data are shown for one representative cell file from each tissue layer . interruptions of the curve in the cortex are caused by presence of dividing cells within the file . further we quantified collectively measured data from several individual cell files of two independent roots . data were evaluated separately for epidermis cortex and endodermis . quantitative evaluation of _LOCATION_ surface area values revealed rather stable distribution of this parameter in the meristematic zone of the epidermis . it increased slightly only in meristematic cells at gradually increasing distances from the stem cell region surpassing slightly even the average reference value for the size of _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ . further recognizable increase in the _LOCATION_ size took place within the transition zone and dramatic increase in the elongation zone of epidermis . mean _METHOD_ intensity of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in interphase _LOCATION_ of epidermis fluctuated considerably however it was high in the meristematic cells . in _LOCATION_ of cells entering the transition zone mean _METHOD_ intensity of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dropped considerably and in _LOCATION_ of elongating cells this drop in mean _METHOD_ intensity was dramatic reflecting the inversely proportional increase in the _LOCATION_ size . _LOCATION_ surface area and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mean signal intensity in cells of different tissues along diverse developmental root zones . average values of _LOCATION_ surface area and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mean signal intensity plotted against cell position counted from the stem cells surrounding quiescence center . data from individual cell files were collected and evaluated separately for epidermis cortex and endodermis from two independent roots . the transition zone is highlighted in pink color . dashed red lines for average mean intensity and dashed blue lines for average _LOCATION_ area of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ are indicated as reference values . major vertical axis represents the values for the normalized mean intensity and minor vertical axis represents values for area measurements . horizontal axis represents the actual cell position counted from the stem cells surrounding quiescence center . because number of cells in cell files is not the same data from individual cell files in average graphs were aligned according to their meristem to transition zone borders . a similar tendency of stable _LOCATION_ size in the meristematic zone a gradual increase in the transition zone and a considerable increase in the elongation zone was recorded also in cell files of the cortex layer . _LOCATION_ size in the meristematic zone did not exceed the reference value for the size of _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ . mean _METHOD_ intensity of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in interphase _LOCATION_ of cortex cells was highest in the meristematic zone . however it _PROTEIN_ dramatically in the transition zone keeping further _PROTEIN_ in the elongation zone as well . size of _LOCATION_ of endodermal cells in the meristematic zone was constant not exceeding the reference value of size measured for _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ showing increase only after passage of meristematic cells into the transition zone . size distribution of _LOCATION_ in the transition zone and the elongation zone of endodermis was wider as in cortex and epidermis but the general tendency of gradual _LOCATION_ size increase from meristem through transition zone to elongation zone was _PROTEIN_ also in endodermis . quantitative comparison of _LOCATION_ surface area and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mean signal intensity in cell developmental zones of the root apex thus showed that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ along the longitudinal axis of the root apex in all three measured tissue layers . highest intensity was measured in the meristematic zone where cells are actively dividing while in the transition zone and further in the elongation zone _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ inversely in relation to the _LOCATION_ area which progressively increased before entering the differentiation zone . reference values for comparison of _LOCATION_ surface area and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mean signal intensity in all types of measured cells from the root apex were recorded from typical cells of the root meristematic zone which were present in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ stages of mitotic cell division . for safe identification of _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ stages we took advantage of long term time lapse imaging of growing root apex in the light sheet microscope . using play back function we identified and picked cells just before mitotic division and marked them as _PROTEIN_ cells . daughter cells derived from mitotic division of these cells were marked as _PROTEIN_ cells . we compared obtained average values of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ with average values of all measured _LOCATION_ from non dividing cells of meristematic zone and all cells of transition and elongation zones for _LOCATION_ surface area and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mean signal intensity . this comparison was done separately for epidermis cortex and endodermis . average values of _LOCATION_ surface area of meristematic cells corresponded well with reference values from _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ . most importantly the average size of _LOCATION_ in the meristematic zone did not exceed the size of _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ . size of _LOCATION_ in transition zone as well as in elongation zone was significantly higher . significant differences in size of _LOCATION_ were also observed between transition zone and elongation zone . similarly average values of _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mean signal intensity of meristematic cells corresponded well with reference values from _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ and there were found significantly lower values of _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mean signal intensity in cells of transition zone and elongation zone in comparison to cells of meristematic zone and reference _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ . from these data we can conclude that both _LOCATION_ size and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ intensity showed significant differences between cells of meristematic zone transition zone and elongation zone and supported the correct classification of cells of the root apex into three distinct developmental zones . reference values of _LOCATION_ area and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mean signal intensity in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ stage meristematic cells as compared to post meristematic cells . average _LOCATION_ surface area and average _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mean signal intensity in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ stage of cell cycle were compared with average values of the same parameters of non dividing cells from meristem transition zone and elongation zone in epidermis cortex and endodermis . comparison of average _LOCATION_ surface area and average _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mean signal intensity values in individual cell developmental zones among individual tissue layers . different letters represent statistical significance according to one way _PROTEIN_ test at p < . from the data presented above it is apparent that there might be a high degree of correlation positive or negative between _LOCATION_ size and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ levels . we pursued this idea by quantitative correlation analysis plotting _LOCATION_ surface area mean signal intensity and integrated signal intensity to clarify whether the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mean signal intensity during passage of root cells through cell developmental zones corresponds to the increase of _LOCATION_ surface area or not . this comparison was done separately for epidermal cortical and endodermal cells . in the meristematic zone we observed the highest variability of the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mean _METHOD_ signal intensity and thus not surprisingly this zone exhibited the lowest correlation between _LOCATION_ surface area and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mean signal intensity . measurements from transition zone and elongation zone were better correlated with prevalent negative values indicating that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mean signal intensity in the transition zone and the elongation zone corresponded _PROTEIN_ to increase of _LOCATION_ surface area and not to decline of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ levels . this suggests prior regulation of _PROTEIN_ protein in the meristematic zone where cells are actively dividing . most importantly values from these three cell developmental zones were separated albeit partially overlapping at their borders in the respective correlation scatter plots . this observation proves the regular passage of cells from one developmental zone to another . similar correlation analysis between _LOCATION_ surface area and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ integrated signal intensity revealed again the partial separation of measurements from meristematic zone transition zone and elongation zone in all three measured tissue layers although lower correlation coefficients and higher variability especially in epidermis and endodermis were apparent . the highest intensity of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signal was measured in the meristematic zone however it was largely fluctuating . in accordance with this _PROTEIN_ the correlation between _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mean signal intensity and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ integrated signal intensity was lowest in the meristematic zone . it could reflect cell cycle dependent regulation of _PROTEIN_ in the zone of mitotically active root cells . in the transition zone and the elongation zone _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ opposite to the increased _LOCATION_ area observation which was corroborated by the higher positive correlation coefficients for comparing _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mean signal intensity and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ integrated signal intensity . quantitative correlation analysis of _LOCATION_ surface area _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mean signal intensity and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ integrated signal intensity in diverse tissues and developmental root zones . separate graphs presenting correlation between _LOCATION_ surface area and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mean signal intensity _LOCATION_ surface area and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ integrated signal intensity and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mean signal intensity and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ integrated signal intensity . data from individual cell files were collected and evaluated separately for epidermis cortex and endodermis from two independent roots . data are plotted separately for meristem transition zone and elongation zone . pearson 's correlation coefficients are shown for each individual cell developmental zone of the root apex .
genomic dna isolated from fresh leaves of days old arabidopsis thaliana heynh . seedlings was used for amplification of the complete coding region of _PROTEIN_ gene together with its upstream promoter region . _PROTEIN_ promoter region was identified according to previously published data and designed using arabidopsis sequence viewer . the promoter sequence was suggested to comprise of base pairs upstream of the start codon of the _PROTEIN_ gene . for the cloning we used technology . primers were designed according to manufacturer 's instructions . whole genomic fragment was recombined into vector and subsequently transferred by lr recombination reaction into the destination vector designed for c terminal _METHOD_ fusion with kanamycin resistance for plant selection . all recombinations were confirmed by sequencing . _PROTEIN_ vector _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was transformed into agrobacterium tumefaciens strain . transformed agrobacteria were used for several independent transformations of arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . seedlings were selected on kanamycin selection medium to identify transgenic plants . transformants carrying _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs were checked for phenotype in comparison to control plants . no phenotypes were discerned and thus the generation of arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was harvested and used for further experiments . twelve days old arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were analyzed on _METHOD_ stereomicroscope leica mz fliii _METHOD_ for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal . protein extraction was carried out

against _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in dilution of . secondary antibody was used in dilution of . after incubation in ecl reagents immunoreactive bands were documented using the biorad _PROTEIN_ system . seeds of arabidopsis thaliana heynh . transgenic line _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were surface sterilized plated onto solidified _METHOD_ medium and kept in for days . after this period seeds were transferred to round mm petri dishes filled with ml of _METHOD_ medium solidified with w/v phytagel and placed into small depressions facilitating gravitropic root growth inside solidified culture medium . plates were cultivated in culture chamber horizontally for days at humidity h light/dark cycle . after germination of seedlings when they were days old they were enclosed by fluorinated ethylene propylene tube with an inner diameter of mm and wall _PROTEIN_ of mm . fep tubes were carefully inserted into culture medium to enclose individual seedling inside . after h seedlings in fep tubes were removed from the plate transferred to the microscope and prepared for imaging according to established protocol . seedlings in fep tubes were prepared according to an open system where root is growing in the original phytagel solidified culture medium in the lower part of fep tube and shoot is growing in the upper aerated part of the fep tube . this approach provides green parts of seedlings with continuous access to oxygen and allows growth and development of roots and shoots in the microscope chamber during long term imaging experiments . all experiments and measurements were done on days old seedlings . developmental live cell imaging was done with the light sheet _METHOD_ microscope equipped with w plan apochromat na water immersion detection objective and lsfm na illumination objective . seedlings were imaged using dual side illumination by a light sheet modulated into a pivot scan mode with excitation laser line nm and with emission filter _PROTEIN_ . image acquisition was done every min in z stack mode for a time period of h. scaling of images in x y and z dimensions was . to prevent the movement of the growing root apex out of the field of view images were acquired in two subsequent views coordinated to each other in y coordinate . images were recorded with the pco.edge scmos camera _PROTEIN_ with the exposure time _METHOD_ from images of the whole root acquired using zen software subsets of data were created with defined and dimensions comprising whole volume of several _LOCATION_ from one particular cell file . several subsets were created in order to segment _LOCATION_ of all cells of particular cell file in ordered positions from the stem cells surrounding quiescence center of the root up to visible cell differentiation at the end of elongation zone . all subsets were transformed to images using maximum intensity projection function of the zen software . in all images uniform correction of brightness and contrast was done before they were exported for image analysis . all quantitative data were produced with publicly available software cellprofiler _PROTEIN_ . _LOCATION_ area from images that represent surface projection of

intensity in the defined region integrated intensity values were calculated as the total pixel intensity in the defined region . values were subsequently normalized to a range using the following formula xn /xmax xmin . thus all biological variables within measured root tips were brought into the comparable proportions and differences in the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were compensated . data from individual cell files were collected and evaluated separately for epidermis cortex and endodermis from two independent experiments . final statistical data evaluation and plot production was done with microsoft excel software . prediction of putative _LOCATION_ export sequences was performed using the netnes server with the accession numbers of the three arabidopsis thaliana _METHOD_
