the positioning and density of leaf stomata are regulated by three secretory peptides epidermal _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . several lines of published evidence have suggested a regulatory pathway as follows . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are perceived by receptor complexes consisting of a receptor like protein too _PROTEIN_ mouths _PROTEIN_ and receptor kinases _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ like _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . these receptors activate a mitogen activated protein kinase module . map kinases phosphorylate and destabilize the transcription _PROTEIN_ speechless _PROTEIN_ resulting in a _PROTEIN_ in the number of stomatal lineage cells . _PROTEIN_ acts antagonistically to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . however there is no direct evidence that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ activate or that _PROTEIN_ inactivates the map kinase cascade through which they might regulate the _PROTEIN_ level . experimental modulation of these peptides in arabidopsis thaliana would change the number of stomatal lineage cells in developing leaves which in turn would change the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ making the interpretation difficult . here we reconstructed this signaling pathway in differentiated leaf cells of nicotiana benthamiana to examine signaling without the confounding effect of cell type change . we show that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are able to activate the map kinase _PROTEIN_ and that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are able to _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ level whereas _PROTEIN_ is able to increase it . our data also suggest that _PROTEIN_ can be recognized by _PROTEIN_ together with any _LOCATION_ family receptor kinase whereas _PROTEIN_ can be recognized by _PROTEIN_ together with _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ but not by _PROTEIN_ together with _LOCATION_ .
to validate the suitability of transient gene _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana for our purpose we first confirmed the _PROTEIN_ of all _METHOD_ _METHOD_ constructs _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ tdtomato in mature n. benthamiana leaves by confocal microscopy and by western blotting _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . hereafter we omit _METHOD_ in construct/protein descriptions . we detected _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ cell margin and cytoplasm _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the apoplast receptor like components _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ at the cell margins and the transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ . bands of expected molecular weights were detected for all _METHOD_ fusion proteins although putative cleavage products of fusion proteins were also detected . we planned to use the levels of recombinant _PROTEIN_ as a read out in our experiments . a drawback of the transient _PROTEIN_ system is that transformation efficiency sometimes varies . to compare _PROTEIN_ produced in different samples we used normalization to phosphinothricin acetyltransferase _PROTEIN_ encoded by the same plasmid as _PROTEIN_ . control experiments showed that _PROTEIN_ was not produced in agrobacterium tumefaciens but was only _PROTEIN_ in agrobacterium infiltrated n. benthamiana . we used the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus promoter to _PROTEIN_ all genes . we examined the effect of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ on _PROTEIN_ transcript levels . the _PROTEIN_ transcript level was unchanged by the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or each of the _LOCATION_ family genes . unexpectedly _PROTEIN_ of the receptor components _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ with _PROTEIN_ increased _PROTEIN_ protein levels . it is possible that receptor components _PROTEIN_ without ligands interfere with the endogenous map kinase pathway of n. benthamiana . _PROTEIN_ was co transformed with _PROTEIN_ and one or two of _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ protein levels were examined . _PROTEIN_ alone increased the _PROTEIN_ level indicating that differentiated leaf cells of n. benthamiana have a machinery that can perceive _PROTEIN_ . co _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ further increased _PROTEIN_ levels . co infiltration of the synthetic _PROTEIN_ peptide was also effective . _PROTEIN_ did not further increase the _PROTEIN_ level when co transformed with _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ alone . however _PROTEIN_ co transformed with _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ or with _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ increased the level of _PROTEIN_ . we next examined the effect of _LOCATION_ on the _PROTEIN_ mediated increase in _PROTEIN_ levels . _PROTEIN_ did not further increase the _PROTEIN_ level when _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ were co transformed . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with or without _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ protein level indicating that differentiated leaf cells of n. benthamiana possess a machinery to perceive not only _PROTEIN_ but also _PROTEIN_ . however _PROTEIN_ co _PROTEIN_ with _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ did not change the _PROTEIN_ level . we reasoned that in the absence of overexpressed _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ might either sequester _PROTEIN_ or inhibit the mapk cascade and thereby inhibit _PROTEIN_ degradation . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ level in the presence of _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ or _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ combinations . these results provide evidence that either of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ in combination with _PROTEIN_ can mediate the _PROTEIN_ signal . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ could not be detected by western blotting perhaps because the fusion protein is unstable . therefore we used _PROTEIN_ myc fusion genes in this experiment . the myc signal was clearly detected by western blotting . _PROTEIN_ myc alone or in the presence of _PROTEIN_ did not affect the _PROTEIN_ protein level . _PROTEIN_ myc with either _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ also had no effect on the _PROTEIN_ level . _PROTEIN_ myc did not affect the _PROTEIN_ level when co transformed with _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ but _PROTEIN_ myc _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ level when co transformed with _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ or with _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ . these results may reflect the ligand receptor specificity . although _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals were not clearly detected in western blotting it had similar a effect to _PROTEIN_ myc . it is possible that an undetectable amount of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was effective . _PROTEIN_ can be a substrate of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . we examined whether _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ affect _PROTEIN_ activation which is a major map kinase functioning in stomatal lineage precursors . we immunoprecipitated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . we detected its active form by western blotting with anti phospho specific _LOCATION_ antibody and detected total _PROTEIN_ with anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . in the presence of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ increased the phosphorylated form of _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ activated _PROTEIN_ . next we examined the effect of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ on _PROTEIN_ activation in the presence of _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ and found that only _PROTEIN_ activated _PROTEIN_ . this is consistent with the data showing that _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ level in the presence of _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ . we also examined the role of _LOCATION_ . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ activated map kinase in the presence of _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ . this is consistent with the data showing that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein levels in the presence of _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ did not affect the activity of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ might inactivate other map kinases including _PROTEIN_ which can phosphorylate _PROTEIN_ .
