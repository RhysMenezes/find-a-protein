_PROTEIN_ is an integral _LOCATION_ protein that facilitates water transport across _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to address the dynamics of arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ at the single molecule level as well as their role in _PROTEIN_ regulation we tracked green _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ molecules by variable angle evanescent wave microscopy and _METHOD_ correlation spectroscopy . single particle tracking analysis revealed that _PROTEIN_ presented four diffusion modes with large dispersion of diffusion coefficients suggesting that partitioning and dynamics of _PROTEIN_ are heterogeneous and more importantly that _PROTEIN_ can move into or out of _LOCATION_ microdomains . in response to salt stress the diffusion coefficients and percentage of restricted diffusion increased implying that _PROTEIN_ internalization was enhanced . this was further supported by the _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ density on _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ by fcs . we additionally demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ internalization involves a combination of two pathways a tyrphostin sensitive clathrin dependent pathway and a methyl cyclodextrin sensitive _LOCATION_ raft associated pathway . the latter was efficiently stimulated under nacl conditions . taken together our findings demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ molecules are heterogeneously distributed on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and that clathrin and _LOCATION_ raft pathways cooperate to mediate the subcellular trafficking of _PROTEIN_ suggesting that the dynamic partitioning and recycling pathways might be involved in the multiple modes of regulating water permeability .
to monitor _PROTEIN_ molecules in plant _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and study their assembly state it was necessary to label them specifically with a _METHOD_ species having suitable biophysical characteristics in _METHOD_ of absorption wavelength and resistance to photobleaching . we performed _METHOD_ targeting experiments in arabidopsis using green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusions . although some _METHOD_ signals in transgenic lines driven by the native promoter could be detected by the electron multiplying charge coupled device the signals were weak and _METHOD_ spots could not be used for single molecule analysis . thus we stably _PROTEIN_ the fusion protein under control of the constitutive promoter . cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labeled _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were observed to ensure that the _METHOD_ insertion did not interfere with _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ targeting . figure shows that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was efficiently targeted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of arabidopsis root epidermal cells . furthermore the water transport activity of _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ was investigated after functional _PROTEIN_ in xenopus oocytes . osmotic swelling assays showed that the osmotic water permeability of oocytes injected with the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ crnas was significantly higher than that of control oocytes _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ alone . when the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of living root epidermal cells was viewed under ewm numerous _METHOD_ spots were observed most of which appeared as well dispersed diffraction limited _METHOD_ spots . figure shows a single video frame taken from a s recording of the epidermal cell _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to determine the number of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ molecules contained in these diffraction limited _METHOD_ spots we performed calibration experiments using purified monomeric _METHOD_ which was immobilized on cover glasses and visualized with ewm illumination . the brightness of a single _METHOD_ molecule could be detected in our measurement apparatus and the _METHOD_ intensity distribution of diffraction limited spots was analyzed . the background corrected area integrated _METHOD_ intensities of individual spots produced a unimodal distribution with a peak intensity around counts . to investigate the oligomerization state of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of living cells we analyzed the _METHOD_ intensity distribution of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ spots . a histogram of the intensity showed an asymmetric distribution skewed to intensities lower than that expected for four fluorophores . the majority of spots had intensities ranging from to counts which were approximately two or threefold that of purified _METHOD_ suggesting that these spots included two or three _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ molecules . to circumvent signal fluctuation due to the diffusion of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in living cell _LOCATION_ the photobleaching of individual spots was further analyzed in fixed cells . for each of the chosen _METHOD_ spots we determined as described previously the number of fluorescing _METHOD_ molecules by counting the number of bleaching steps . as shown in figure the number of bleaching steps ranged from one to four for the analyzed puncta . we then studied the dynamic properties of _PROTEIN_ in more detail using single particle tracking _PROTEIN_ in continuous images . some molecules covered relatively long distances _METHOD_ whereas others were less mobile _METHOD_ . the diffusion type was evaluated by analysis of mean square displacement _METHOD_ versus time plots of the trajectories of individual molecules . the curve fitting relationship between _METHOD_ and time showed that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ diffusion could be classified into four categories pure brownian diffusion directed diffusion pure restricted or confined diffusion with an average confinement range of nm or diffusion with combinations of brownian and restricted modes referred to as a mixed trajectory . the proportion of the last category was with the mean value of the confinement range generally larger than that of pure restricted trajectories . although one third of the _PROTEIN_ spots had a pure brownian diffusion most _PROTEIN_ molecules were restricted in confinement zones which were emphasized by the mixed trajectory regime . the diffusion coefficient of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ particles was calculated by linear fit to _METHOD_ versus time _METHOD_ plots . the distribution of the diffusion coefficients was plotted in a histogram having logarithmically spaced bins . the data were fitted using gaussians the position of the peak being considered the characteristic diffusion coefficient . figure shows that was around with a large dispersion of diffusion coefficients most of which were between and indicating that the movement of _PROTEIN_ was heterogeneous . when the diffusion coefficients and the percentage of different diffusion modes were plotted against the _METHOD_ intensity _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ we found that the diffusion characters were not directly associated with the _METHOD_ intensity . we were curious as to whether the dynamic characteristics of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were general because no such analysis of _LOCATION_ proteins has been reported in plant cells . therefore we compared the behavior of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ a small _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker protein . as illustrated in supplemental figure online the diffusion coefficient of _METHOD_ ranged from to with a value of which is fold that of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . to extract more information about the behavior of individual _METHOD_ _METHOD_ particles we further analyzed the diffusion mode according to the initial selection criteria described above . over of the _METHOD_ molecules exhibited brownian diffusion whereas other _METHOD_ molecules underwent directed diffusion and restricted diffusion . however almost no mixed trajectory was detected . these results show that our analysis was sensitive enough to distinguish the dynamics of two different proteins . thus _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ exhibited specific dynamic properties . to understand better the molecular _METHOD_ underlying _PROTEIN_ partitioning into _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ domains we treated seedlings with methyl cyclodextrin a sterol disrupting reagent . the subsequent reduction in sterol levels was monitored by cell staining with filipin a _METHOD_ polyene antibiotic that binds to sterols . treatment with mm resulted in the effective depletion of sterol in root cells by . under confocal laser scanning microscopy and ewm we found that actin filaments became slightly shorter after treatment with whereas the elongation rate and the rate of convolution frequency did not significantly change suggesting that treatment did not significantly affect the organization of the actin _LOCATION_ . as shown in figure treatment with induced dramatic changes in the partitioning of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ compared with that in control cells . more specifically the well dispersed patterns of diffraction limited spots disappeared . instead some particles accumulated into small clusters which were brighter than diffraction limited spots . disappearance of _PROTEIN_ molecules in certain areas was also observed . we further followed the impacts of fenpropimorph a sterol synthesis inhibitor and dl threo phenyl palmitoylamino morpholino propanol _PROTEIN_ a sphingolipid biosynthesis inhibitor on the localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . both inhibitors resulted in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ coalescing into larger particles with an increased _METHOD_ intensity similar to the effect of treatment . these results suggest that the partitioning of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ depends on _LOCATION_ lipids and on the sterol content . because of its multiple diffusion modes and dependency on sterol we suspected that _PROTEIN_ localized at least partially to sphingolipid rich microdomains referred to as _LOCATION_ rafts . to validate this assumption cells coexpressing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and mcherry _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ were imaged by dual color ewm . excitation was switched between two lasers so that the cells were alternatively illuminated with blue and green light and sequential video frames were obtained . when two consecutive frames representing green and red _METHOD_ were overlaid we detected some yellow regions caused by the high intensity in both the green and red channels suggesting an overlap of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and mcherry _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ foci . an example of colocalization is shown in figures to and the _PROTEIN_ diffusion trajectories of the overlapped _METHOD_ spots are shown in figures and . to test the possibility that the colocalization was due to random overlap of the highly dense foci on the cell _LOCATION_ the red channel image from four different cells was rotated with respect to the green channel as reported in a previous investigation . the average peak distance for the original image was significantly smaller from that of the rotated images indicating that the colocalization was significant . tracking the _METHOD_ spots of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ from their colocalization with mcherry _PROTEIN_ clearly showed that the movements of these _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ spots were _PROTEIN_ confined within a specific area the average displacement of the confined _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ being nm . these spots also exhibited restricted or mixed trajectory diffusion . within the mixed trajectories _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ exhibited restricted diffusion when it was confined in mcherry _PROTEIN_ rich structures . these results imply that the partitioning of _PROTEIN_ on _LOCATION_ is closely related to _LOCATION_ rafts . the effects of treating roots with mm nacl on _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cellular dynamics were first investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy . whereas homogenous labeling of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ by _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was observed under normal conditions salt exposure resulted in a discontinuous labeling pattern after min a similar phenomenon was also detected using mm sorbitol as a comparable osmotic stress . after staining with a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ areas with discontinuous _METHOD_ labeling were found to be intact and unperturbed by the salt treatment . furthermore we observed the appearance of intracellular structures containing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in a restricted number of cells . parallel experiments with seedlings _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ an independent marker of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ showed much less pronounced relocalization of _METHOD_ after nacl and sorbitol treatments . when observed by ewm salt treated epidermal cells displayed highly mobile puncta dispersed on the _LOCATION_ . the dynamic characteristics of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ after treatment with mm nacl were also investigated using _PROTEIN_ analysis . as illustrated in the histogram of figure the diffusion coefficients of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in nacl treated cells ranged _PROTEIN_ from to the highest value of was times higher than in control cells . more specifically increased to more than twofold that of the diffusion coefficient of _PROTEIN_ in control cells . to investigate further the behavior of _PROTEIN_ in living cells exposed to salt the percentage of different diffusion modes was also analyzed . as shown in figure and with respect to normal conditions brownian diffusion directed diffusion and mixed trajectory _PROTEIN_ to and of the control values respectively while restricted diffusion increased significantly to compared with control cells . these changes indicate that in relation to the modified surface and intracellular _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labeling observed under nacl treatment conditions diffusion coefficients were skewed toward higher values and more _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ molecules underwent restricted diffusion . endocytosis is a basic cellular process used by cells to internalize a variety of molecules . the discovery of clathrin dependent endocytosis has provided a fundamental paradigm for analyzing _LOCATION_ trafficking in cells . moreover a sterol dependent pathway has also been reported to play an important role in arabidopsis . to investigate the pathways that are involved in _PROTEIN_ trafficking under normal conditions and in its relocalization upon stimulation we compared the localization of _PROTEIN_ to that of clathrin light chain and _PROTEIN_ two commonly used endocytic markers for the clathrin dependent pathway and _LOCATION_ raft associated pathway respectively . cells coexpressing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ clc were imaged using dual color ewm . instead of diffraction limited _METHOD_ foci with _PROTEIN_ diffusion on the _LOCATION_ we detected green and red particles or clusters that were localized in the cytoplasm region proximal to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and that exhibited movements of departing from _LOCATION_ . for quantification two particles were arbitrarily considered as codiffusing when at least one pixel of their _METHOD_ signals overlapped during at least five consecutive frames acquired within a _METHOD_ interval . as illustrated in figure _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was found to colocalize with mcherry clc and gradually codiffused away from the focus indicating that the internalization of _PROTEIN_ was associated with the clathrin dependent pathway . as shown in figure partial colocalization and codiffusion of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and mcherry _PROTEIN_ were also detected suggesting that under normal conditions the internalization of _PROTEIN_ was also associated with _LOCATION_ rafts but to a lesser extent than with clathrin . to understand at a quantitative level how both recycling pathways contribute to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ internalization we examined the temporal interactions using live cell _METHOD_ cross correlation spectroscopy . the _METHOD_ fluctuation of _METHOD_ and mcherry gave rise to cross correlation signals in both seedlings _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ clc or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ flot . the relative cross correlation amplitude was for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ clc while the value was for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ suggesting that the interaction between _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and mcherry clc was stronger than that between _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and mcherry _PROTEIN_ consistent with the results obtained by ewm . when the seedlings were exposed to mm nacl the interactions between _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ clc and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ significantly increased . the relative cross correlation amplitude was and revealing that the correlation between _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and endocytic pathways became much stronger under hypertonic stress . note that the increase in cross correlation amplitude of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was higher compared with that of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ clc . we then investigated the effects on _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ movement of tyrphostin a well characterized inhibitor of the clathrin mediated endocytic pathway . is thought to block specifically the interaction of endocytic cargo motifs with the clathrin medium chain . this interaction is crucial for establishing a link between the _LOCATION_ domains of _LOCATION_ proteins to the clathrin coat involved in vesicle formation . exposure of seedlings to led to an overall _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ diffusion coefficients with reduced to . the percentage of mixed trajectory after treatment with increased notably to twofold that of untreated control cells at the expense of brownian and restricted diffusion which _PROTEIN_ to and respectively of those in untreated control cells . no obvious change in directed diffusion was detected . also the effects of were found to be reversible at min after washout the value had increased to comparable to that of the control cells . when tyrphostin an analog of that does not interfere with the clathrin cargo interaction was used the diffusion coefficient of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ did not change . the recovery experiment and noneffective analog treatment clearly suggested that the concentrations of used in this study were within the physiological range and its effect is rather specific . unlike in the presence of the histogram of diffusion coefficients after treatment showed a broad bimodal distribution suggesting the existence of two subpopulations of diffusing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ molecules . one subpopulation would correspond to molecules with a modal diffusion coefficient comparable to that observed under normal conditions . by contrast most other _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ molecules diffused slowly with which was times lower . among the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ molecules analyzed after treatment the percentage of brownian diffusion declined to of the untreated control cell value and no obvious changes in the directed diffusion and mixed trajectory were detected . in contrast with treatment with treatment increased the restricted diffusion to that of untreated control cells . these results demonstrate that treatment with and induced qualitatively different changes in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ dynamic characteristics suggesting that clathrin dependent endocytosis and _LOCATION_ rafts exerted different effects on _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ movements under normal conditions . the effects of and were also investigated in cells exposed to the salt treatment . when the roots were pretreated with the of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to . brownian diffusion and restricted diffusion _PROTEIN_ to and respectively of the control treatment with salt alone by contrast the mixed trajectory increased to of the control treatment with salt alone . no obvious change in directed diffusion was observed . the tendencies for dynamic changes after treatment with under nacl exposure were comparable to those after treatment with under normal conditions . when the roots were pretreated with the bimodal repartition of the diffusion coefficient disappeared and _PROTEIN_ to . in addition brownian diffusion and restricted diffusion _PROTEIN_ to and of the control treatment with salt alone respectively . while the mixed trajectory increased to of the control treatment with salt alone the percentage of directed diffusion was equal to the control treatment with salt alone . the tendencies in dynamic changes after treatment with under nacl exposure were different from those after treatment with under normal conditions . however they were similar to those after treatment under nacl exposure implying that inhibition of clathrin dependent and _LOCATION_ raft associated endocytosis induced similar changes in _PROTEIN_ movement . to reveal the partitioning of _PROTEIN_ between the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and its recycling pathways fcs was used to measure the density of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ under different conditions . fcs measurement was established by focusing an excitation laser beam onto the _LOCATION_ and then monitoring _METHOD_ fluctuations within the focal volume of the laser beam . applying the parameters of equation gave an average density for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ of molecules indicating that an average of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ molecules occupied the area covered in the confocal volume . a higher _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ density was detected after treatment with indicating that more _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ molecules dwell on the _LOCATION_ after the inhibition of clathrin dependent endocytosis . by contrast the density of _PROTEIN_ did not significantly change after treatment with fen or _PROTEIN_ suggesting that under normal conditions disturbance of _LOCATION_ rafts did not alter the amount of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ molecules on the _LOCATION_ . when the roots were exposed to mm nacl the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ density dropped to molecules implying that salt exposure induced internalization of _PROTEIN_ . we also measured _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ molecular density after disturbing the endocytic pathways prior to exposure to mm nacl . under pretreatment and with respect to mm nacl alone the density of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ on _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ significantly increased by to molecules . after disrupting the _LOCATION_ raft associated endocytic pathway by a pretreatment the density also significantly increased to molecules > higher than that of cells with salt alone . pretreatments with fen and _PROTEIN_ also increased the density of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to molecules and molecules . these data indicate that both the clathrin dependent and raft associated endocytic pathways influenced endocytosis under mm nacl exposure conditions .
a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plant _PROTEIN_ vector was constructed as follows . the coding sequence for at _PROTEIN_ was pcr amplified using the primers tctagaatggcaaaggatgtggaagccgttc and _PROTEIN_ and was subcloned as a xbai sali fragment into a modified vector . the mcherry and mcherry clc plant _PROTEIN_ vectors were constructed with the coding sequences for _PROTEIN_ and clc which were pcr amplified using specific primer pairs _PROTEIN_ and subcloned as bamhi ecori fragments into a modified vector . arabidopsis thaliana ecotype columbia wild type was transformed with the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ mcherry _PROTEIN_ and mcherry clc constructs using the agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated floral dip method . the preparation of plants _PROTEIN_ a _METHOD_ is described elsewhere . transgenic plants were selected on solid medium half strength murashige and skoog _METHOD_ salts medium containing kanamycin for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and hygromycin for mcherry _PROTEIN_ and mcherry clc . seeds were surface sterilized for min in ethanol transferred to naclo for min and then washed five times with sterilized distilled water . subsequently they were transferred to a thin layer of solid medium containing half strength _METHOD_ salts with plant agar . plants were cultured at under long day conditions for d. the stock solution of was prepared in deionized water . was dissolved in _METHOD_ to yield a mm stock solution . the inhibitors were diluted in half strength _METHOD_ medium and the final _METHOD_ concentration was in all ewm analyses . vertically grown d old seedlings were incubated in half strength liquid _METHOD_ medium containing or mm for min . for the washout experiment the seedlings were first incubated in half strength liquid _METHOD_ medium containing for min transferred to media without for min then observed under ewm . for the treatment with fen seedlings were grown vertically on half strength _METHOD_ agar plates with fen for d prior to imaging in half strength _METHOD_ media . for treatment with _PROTEIN_ the seedlings first grew on half strength _METHOD_ agar medium for d and then the d old seedlings were transferred to _METHOD_ agar medium with _PROTEIN_ to grow for another d. the effects of nacl were studied by supplementing the half strength _METHOD_ medium with mm nacl . parallel experiments with sorbitol were performed by supplementing the half strength _METHOD_ medium with mm sorbitol . the effects of and under mm nacl exposure were studied by pretreatment with or mm for min followed by incubation in the same solution but supplemented with mm nacl . after the indicated times seedlings were transferred to a glass slide with of inhibitor solution and covered with a cover slip . for staining d old vertically grown seedlings were transferred to diluted in half strength _METHOD_ medium for min after being exposed to mm nacl for min . then these seedlings were observed under confocal laser scanning microscopy . an objective type evanescent wave microscope which was based on an inverted microscope with a total internal reflective _METHOD_ illuminator and a oil immersion objective was used for single molecule _METHOD_ imaging . the nm laser line from a diode laser was used to excite _METHOD_ and mcherry . _METHOD_ signals were collected by the objective and passed through two filters a ba long pass filter and an band pass filter before being directed using a back illuminated emccd camera _PROTEIN_ and high quality filters . we set the gain of our emccd camera at throughout all single molecule imaging experiments the setting was in the linear dynamic range of the emccd camera . images were acquired with _METHOD_ exposure time and analyzed with image j software _PROTEIN_ . time lapse series of single particles of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ images were taken at up to images per sequence . for the analysis of single molecule _METHOD_ intensity in a movie acquired from living cells the background _METHOD_ was first subtracted from each frame using the rolling ball method in image j software . then the first frame of each movie was used for _METHOD_ spot selection . after the image processing the brightest pixel in each _METHOD_ spot within the diffraction limited size was determined as the central position and a square of pixels was enclosed as a region of interest to calculate the integrated _METHOD_ intensity with image j . to analyze dynamic properties _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ foci were tracked using spatially and temporally global particle assignment described in detail elsewhere . we analyzed the _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ labeled _PROTEIN_ spots using the following equation where and are the initial coordinates and x and y are the coordinates at any given time . for calculating the diffusion coefficient we plotted _METHOD_ from each trajectory against time . for each molecule the slope of the first four time points in the _METHOD_ t plot was used to calculate the diffusion coefficient according to the following equation in the text the diffusion coefficients correspond to single gaussian fit of the d _METHOD_ . the se values of the position of the peak were determined using origin software and are given in the form of an upper and lower diffusion coefficient . determination of the motional modes and parameters was performed according to citation . for each trajectory we first linearly fit the _METHOD_ . if the _METHOD_ t plot was a straight line with a slope of it was a typical trajectory for spots undergoing brownian diffusion . if the _METHOD_ t plot showed a positive or negative deviation from a straight line with a slope of the motion was determined as directed or restricted diffusion . for the mixed trajectory exhibiting a combination of brownian and apparent restricted diffusion mode the trajectory was split and the _METHOD_ of each segment was adjusted with a linear or an exponential curve . in a few cases no convincing _METHOD_ t fits could be obtained and the trajectories were rejected . the range of an individual _METHOD_ spot movement during the time interval can be estimated from the following equation the colocalization algorithm was obtained using the image j plugins colocalization test and colocalization threshold of t. collins and w. rasband and bg subtraction from roi from m. cammer and t. collins . colocalization was performed as previously described . fcs was performed on a leica tcs fcs microscope equipped with a nm argon laser in house coupled correlator and avalanche photodiode . after acquiring a scan image of cells in transmitted light mode fcs was performed in the point scanning mode . the laser focus was placed at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of a cell . the diffusion of fluorophores into and out of the focal volume alters the local concentration of fluorophores and thus leads to spontaneous _METHOD_ intensity fluctuations . the autocorrelation function g was calculated with the hardware correlator as / where f is the _METHOD_ fluctuation caused by a particle entering the confocal volume and f is the _METHOD_ fluctuation by the same particle at time . igorpro software was used to fit the data to the two dimensional one particle one triplet models as follows where n is the number of particles in the observation volume ftrip is the fraction of particles in the triplet state and ttrip is the triplet relaxation time . when the volume element was projected onto a single cell _METHOD_ labeled _PROTEIN_ localized in the cell _LOCATION_ was observed . thus the parameter n which could be obtained by fitting the autocorrelation function characterized the total number of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ proteins in the cell _LOCATION_ inside the confocal volume . the dimensions of the observation volume element were defined by the half axes for length and width . the waist of the confocal volume ellipsoid was assumed to be situated on the cell _LOCATION_ such that the highest _METHOD_ intensity was given . in this case the surface area on the _LOCATION_ covered by the focus would be a circular area with a radius equal to . the circular area covered by the focus volume could be estimated as . therefore the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ density estimated in the confocal volume could be _PROTEIN_ as the total number of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ divided by the area covered as follows the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ density was obtained from each individual cell _LOCATION_ . two random positions were selected once and an autocorrelation measurement was performed for s each for every single measurement point . up to six random points were selected in one cell three cells were chosen in a root and at least five representative roots were studied for each measurement . for quantitatively evaluating the interaction of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ clc fccs was performed . the amplitude of the cross correlation function was normalized to the amplitude of the autocorrelation function of _METHOD_ to calculate the relative cross correlation / as described in a previous investigation . up to six random points were selected in one cell five cells were chosen in a root and at least three representative roots were studied for each measurement . sequence data from this article can be found in the arabidopsis information resource database under the following accession numbers _PROTEIN_
