we provide evidence that _PROTEIN_ promotes flowering by regulating the transcript levels of several important integrators and floral meristem identity genes including _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . dna binding protein phosphatases which exhibit both sequence specific dna binding and protein phosphatase activities are important regulators that are involved in both the transcriptional and post translational regulations . dbp _PROTEIN_ are known to mediate susceptibility to potyviruses however whether they are involved in other processes is still unclear . in this study under both long day _PROTEIN_ and short day conditions _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants displayed early flowering while the knock out mutants _PROTEIN_ exhibited a delay in flowering relative to the wild type plants both the overexpressing lines and _PROTEIN_ mutants remained photoperiodic sensitive indicating that _PROTEIN_ was involved in the autonomous pathway . _PROTEIN_ does not respond to vernalization at transcript level and both _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants and _PROTEIN_ mutants remain responsive to vernalization indicating that _PROTEIN_ may not be directly involved in vernalization . real time pcr analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ can suppress flowering locuc c _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a key integrator of the autonomous and vernalization pathways and enhance the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ and flowering locuc t key regulators of the _PROTEIN_ pathway . furthermore _PROTEIN_ of floral meristem identity genes including _PROTEIN_ of overexpression of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was also promoted in _PROTEIN_ plants . _PROTEIN_ transcription can be detected in root leaf stem flower and silique . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein were localized in the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . our results provide the evidence demonstrating the effective role of _PROTEIN_ for flowering time regulation and report a novel function of dbp _PROTEIN_ in planta besides in plant defense .
t dna insertion mutants of _PROTEIN_ were genotyped using pcr tests to identify homozygous mutants . the t dna insertion in _PROTEIN_ mutants was located in the first intron of the _PROTEIN_ gene . semi quantitative rt pcr analysis indicated that the _PROTEIN_ transcript was completely absent in the homozygous mutants . according to a previous report _PROTEIN_ mutants have an enhanced resistance to infection by two potyviruses but no major effect in plant architecture or growth habit has been observed . however in the present study we found that the _PROTEIN_ mutant showed a slightly delayed flowering time compared to wt under both _PROTEIN_ and sd conditions . under _PROTEIN_ conditions wt plants began to flower at days after sowing with rosette leaves per rosette on average whereas _PROTEIN_ mutant plants took days to flower with rosette leaves on average per rosette . under sd conditions wt plants began to flower at days after sowing with rosette leaves on average whereas _PROTEIN_ mutant plants took days to flower with rosette leaves on average . the _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines _PROTEIN_ and the complementation lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were generated to further confirm that the delayed flowering time of the _PROTEIN_ mutant resulted from the disruption of _PROTEIN_ transcription . _PROTEIN_ was cloned into the _PROTEIN_ binary vector driven by camv and was subsequently transformed into the wt and _PROTEIN_ mutant . overexpressing lines and complementation lines were obtained . the _PROTEIN_ transcription level in overexpressing lines and one complementation line _PROTEIN_ was much higher than that in the wt plants . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ significantly accelerated the flowering time of arabidopsis . under _PROTEIN_ conditions _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines took only days to flower whereas wt plants took days to flower . under sd conditions _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines took days to flower whereas wt plants took days to flower . the transcription level of _PROTEIN_ in another complementation line _PROTEIN_ was comparable to that in wt plants . the _PROTEIN_ plants showed a similar phenotype as the wt plants under both _PROTEIN_ and sd conditions indicating a full functional complementation of _PROTEIN_ . these results indicated that _PROTEIN_ could positively regulate the flowering time of arabidopsis in a dose dependent manner . the effect of photoperiod on the level of _PROTEIN_ mrna was examined in aerial parts of wt plant . the results showed that _PROTEIN_ did not respond to the photoperiod at the transcriptional level . since arabidopsis is a _PROTEIN_ plant flower development of arabidopsis is promoted by _PROTEIN_ conditions and delayed by sd conditions . in our study _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants and _PROTEIN_ mutants grown under _PROTEIN_ conditions flowered significantly earlier than those grown under sd conditions just as the wt plants . both _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants and _PROTEIN_ mutants were still sensitive to the photoperiod . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is a gene that regulates flowering time in arabidopsis via a pathway that is independent of the day length thus is likely involved in the autonomous pathway . usually mutants of genes in autonomous pathways show a strong response to vernalization the _PROTEIN_ flowering phenotype of these mutants is strongly suppressed by vernalization . therefore we examined if _PROTEIN_ was also involved in vernalization . first the effect of vernalization on the level of _PROTEIN_ mrna was investigated . _PROTEIN_ did not respond to vernalization at the transcript level . the phenotypes of the overexpressing lines and the _PROTEIN_ mutant under vernalization treatment were investigated . after vernalization treatment the flowering time of _PROTEIN_ mutants and wt plants were not different the _PROTEIN_ flowering phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutant was suppressed just as was the case with other mutants of the autonomous pathway . while _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines still flowered earlier than the wt although the early flowering phenotype of overexpressing lines was significantly suppressed . both the _PROTEIN_ mutants and _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants remain responsive to vernalization indicating that _PROTEIN_ might not be directly involved in vernalization . to gain more insights into the role of _PROTEIN_ in flowering time regulation we monitored the _PROTEIN_ of the well known flowering time regulators in wt _PROTEIN_ mutants and two _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines by real time pcr analysis . considering _PROTEIN_ as a key regulator of the autonomous and vernalization pathways we first analyzed the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ significantly suppressed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ while disruption of _PROTEIN_ significantly promoted _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ indicating that a close antagonistic relationship between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ excisted . we also analyzed the _PROTEIN_ of other genes that are involved in the autonomous pathway including _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . although the _PROTEIN_ of these genes was slightly increased in two overexpressing lines and slightly _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mutant these differences were not statistically significant . since _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are key genes integrating multiple flowering pathways we investigated the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines and _PROTEIN_ mutants . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was reduced in the _PROTEIN_ mutant while increased in two overexpressing lines demonstrating a positive relationship between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was also higher in two overexpressing lines but did not alter in _PROTEIN_ mutants under _PROTEIN_ conditions . the genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are involved in the long day pathway and _PROTEIN_ gene is a central regulator that accelerates flowering in the _PROTEIN_ pathway . therefore _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was investigated as shown in fig . . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ increased in two overexpressing lines but was not significantly changed in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . in a similar fashion the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene which was characterized to interact with _PROTEIN_ to activate floral meristem genes increased in two overexpressing lines . to investigate the subcellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein we tagged the _METHOD_ protein to _PROTEIN_ protein transiently _PROTEIN_ the fusion protein in onion epidermal cells and investigated the cellular _PROTEIN_ . fusion of _METHOD_ protein coding sequences to coding regions of target protein has become a valuable tool for determining cellular locations in plants . however it has been reported that the tag may affect the native protein folding so the subcellular localization of the c terminal fusion proteins might not be consistent with that of the n terminal fusion proteins . to fully investigate the cellular location of _PROTEIN_ we tagged the _METHOD_ protein to either the n or the c termini of _PROTEIN_ and investigated their cellular _PROTEIN_ respectively . our work revealed that _PROTEIN_ protein was distributed in the _LOCATION_ and in the _LOCATION_ irrespective of which termini the tag was attached to . similar results were also described by castello et al . . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was detected in the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ when transiently _PROTEIN_ in nicotiana benthamiana leaves . the _LOCATION_ location of _PROTEIN_ indicated that _PROTEIN_ might mediate the transcriptional regulation of plant genes . organ specific _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was analyzed by semi quantitative pcr . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was observed in almost all organs including the root stem leaf flower and silique .
