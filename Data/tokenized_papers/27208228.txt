integrity of biomembranes is vital to living _METHOD_ . in bacteria pspa is considered to act as repairing damaged _LOCATION_ by forming large supercomplexes in arabidopsis . vulnerable to oxidative stress photosynthetic _METHOD_ also contain a pspa ortholog called _PROTEIN_ which has an additional c terminal tail . in this study vc was shown to coincide with an intrinsically disordered region and the role of _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ protection against stress was investigated . we visualized _PROTEIN_ by fusing it to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and investigated its behavior in vivo with live imaging . the intrinsically disordered nature of vc enabled _PROTEIN_ to form what appeared to be functional particles along envelopes whereas the deletion of vc caused excessive association of the _PROTEIN_ particles preventing their active movement for _LOCATION_ protection . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ lacking vc complemented _PROTEIN_ mutation but exhibited sensitivity to heat shock stress . conversely transgenic plants over _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed enhanced tolerance against heat shock suggesting that vc negatively regulates _PROTEIN_ particle association and acts in _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ integrity . our data thus indicate that _PROTEIN_ is involved in the _PROTEIN_ of photosynthetic _LOCATION_ . during evolution chloroplasts have acquired enhanced tolerance against _LOCATION_ stress by incorporating a disordered c terminal tail into _PROTEIN_ .
we first investigated vc based on in silico prediction _METHOD_ . pspa and _PROTEIN_ share the position and length of helices throughout all amino acid residues except for the _PROTEIN_ specific addition of n terminal transit peptide and vc . in addition psipred prediction gave us an extremely high probability of vc as idr with many hydrophilic _PROTEIN_ residues . this idr property was disrupted at position . to ascertain whether vc represents an idr or not circular dichroism spectra of a synthetic peptide precisely corresponding to vc were examined . regular secondary structural elements such as helix and sheet in globular proteins produced characteristic spectral peaks at and nm although a large negative peak at approximately nm is characteristic to the coil conformation that dominates in disordered proteins . the minimum spectrum of vc at around nm typically showed the property of idr . the small negative peak at approximately nm possibly corresponds to the region that _METHOD_ preferably a short amphipathic helix with one hydrophobic face comprising conserved nonpolar residues opposite to the hydrophilic residues marked in red . the ellipticity at nm was monitored upon increasing the temperature and was found to increase gradually . however the lack of an obvious thermal transition indicated that vc does not take a prominent secondary structure . in addition the slight cd spectral change was reversible . to quantitatively analyze the composition of vc the cd spectra were deconvoluted into turns and unordered . the results indicated that the regular helix is only and the bulk of vc showed a disordered character . based on these observations we concluded that _PROTEIN_ is partially disordered at vc . next we tested how vc affects the _PROTEIN_ supercomplex assembly . structural analysis revealed that _PROTEIN_ assembles into a homooligomeric _PROTEIN_ structure _PROTEIN_ with high molecular _METHOD_ in vivo and in vitro which is dependent on helix at its n terminus . microscopic observations of protoplasts or guard cells from transgenic lines over _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the wild type arabidopsis ecotype columbia revealed that the deletion of vc altered the patterns of _PROTEIN_ supercomplex and induced excessive mutual association of fvp . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ particles per chloroplast were markedly fewer in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ than in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . similarly the average numbers of larger and irregular particles/clumps increased more in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ than in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . to check this result further total chloroplast proteins purified from these plants were separated by native _PROTEIN_ followed by second dimension _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and western blotting . as reported previously _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ formed a large complex of > mda whose size is comparable to those in col . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ also formed a larger complex and co migrated with endogenous _PROTEIN_ . based on these results we concluded that vc deletion leads fvp to self associate to form larger clumps thereby vc negatively controls _PROTEIN_ s homooligomeric assembly . consistent with the clustering of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ inside chloroplasts particle analysis of negatively stained _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli also presented a clustering of fvp when vc was deleted . observation of _PROTEIN_ fvps using tem demonstrated that the clusters consisting of two or more particles accounted respectively for or of all fvps . in contrast fvps from _PROTEIN_ were detected as single particles . we noted this result was somewhat different from previous observations of fvps in other _METHOD_ in which even native _PROTEIN_ was reported to form rod like aggregates in vitro . we accounted for the observed discrepancy for the different experimental condition because p instead of tris buffer was used in our study . to test this possibility we replaced buffer by dialysis with tris buffer and subjected _PROTEIN_ particles to tem analysis . the result indeed showed that _PROTEIN_ was able to form rods that appeared to consist of fvps as previously reported . _PROTEIN_ also formed rods but it tended to show highly variable structures like long rods and clustered larger particles all of which were rarely detectable in our _PROTEIN_ preparation . given that our result is consistent with those from citation we considered that _PROTEIN_ aggregates more than _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis in vitro . along with the observation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in vivo these results demonstrated that vc acts in preventing clustering and in retaining the flexibility of fvps . to assess the effect of vc deletion on _PROTEIN_ dynamics hypotonic stress was given to protoplasts isolated from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ as reported previously in citation . we have shown that hypotonic treatment of mesophyll cells protoplasts or purified chloroplasts caused _PROTEIN_ to disassemble and to become highly mobile in the areas where stroma is swollen due to the hypotonic stress . under moderate hypotonic stress only a few small fvps in transgenic lines showed movement . upon increasing the hypotonic stress however most particles began to move . similar dynamics of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ particles was also observed with isolated chloroplasts or mesophyll cells of leaves under hypotonic stress conditions . dynamic movement of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is always concomitant with the hypotonic stress which leads to the observation of swollen chloroplasts . time lapse _METHOD_ images of figure presented tracking observation of moving _PROTEIN_ signals under this condition . no noticeable movement of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ particles was detected in protoplast without hypotonic stress . this mobile characteristic of _PROTEIN_ gpf particles suggests that vc is not necessary for fvp to retain its ability to move and that it is consistent with the _PROTEIN_ that pspa by itself has the capacity to move . our live imaging therefore supports our notion that vc acts to prevent fvp from forming excessive aggregation . we infer that large particles in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ do not respond promptly to _LOCATION_ stress which therefore engenders a _PROTEIN_ recovery rate against stress . _PROTEIN_ segment shows high similarity with bacterial pspa raising the possibility that the two proteins act redundantly . our previous study demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ can complement a defective proton motive force of pspa mutation in e. coli . nevertheless pspa _PROTEIN_ has not been tested in arabidopsis chloroplasts . to test this possibility two fusion proteins _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were over _PROTEIN_ in col under the constitutive camv promoter . these proteins were _PROTEIN_ as fused to the n terminal transit peptide derived from _PROTEIN_ so as to deliver them to chloroplasts . immunoblot analysis of these plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ indicated that each fusion protein accumulated comparatively . similar to the case in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was detected as larger and irregular particles inside chloroplasts . in contrast _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ formed smaller particles similar to those of fvps observed in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . addition of vc enabled pspa to form smaller clumps followed by an increased number of particles per chloroplast . consequently these results demonstrated that vc negatively affects both _PROTEIN_ and pspa clustering status in vivo . we next performed complementation experiments of _PROTEIN_ ko with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . immunoblot analysis of these transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ensured comparable _PROTEIN_ levels between the two lines . the results showed that the lack of _PROTEIN_ causes a severe defect in chloroplast biogenesis _PROTEIN_ ko _PROTEIN_ dies at the seedling stage with albino like phenotype . despite the structural similarity in the complex formation described above neither _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ nor _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ complemented the seedling lethality of _PROTEIN_ ko . no functional exchangeability between pspa and _PROTEIN_ has been reported in synechocystis . together our results demonstrated that the n terminal pspa like sequences of _PROTEIN_ include important information that is useful to distinguish _PROTEIN_ from pspa most likely because of a different binding ability to the partner proteins . nevertheless we infer that intrinsically disordered vc acts in both pspa and _PROTEIN_ to give its complex formation and structural flexibility which is expected to be related to the _LOCATION_ repair capacity . we assessed whether _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ can complement the lethality of _PROTEIN_ ko . we generated transgenic lines that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ by _PROTEIN_ s own promoter under a _PROTEIN_ ko background . these two lines pv _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ko and pv _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ko grew normally and presented chloroplast morphologies that were indistinguishable from those in col demonstrating that vc is dispensable . we confirmed that both transgenic lines accumulated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to a level similar to endogenous _PROTEIN_ in col . it is noteworthy that fvps visualized by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were distinguishable as was observed by over _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed larger clumps whereas _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fnps were smaller and round implicating that the observed difference in fnp structures do not influence plant growth under normal conditions . we assumed that vc gives _PROTEIN_ the capacity for flexible formation of supercomplexes under stress conditions and that the presence or absence of vc may affect response to stress conditions leading to _LOCATION_ damage . therefore pv _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ko and pv _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ko were characterized further for their photosynthetic activities under various stress conditions . given that bacterial pspa is highly induced by extreme heat shock and that it acts in _PROTEIN_ cytoplasmic _LOCATION_ integrity _PROTEIN_ is likely to protect chloroplast _LOCATION_ against heat shock . to test this possibility detached leaves from these transgenic lines were subjected to heat shock stress and measured chloroplast activity based on chlorophyll _METHOD_ parameters . as a reference we measured the relative _METHOD_ decline and photosystem ii photochemical efficiency . rfd as a plant vitality index is correlated to the potential photosynthetic net _PROTEIN_ fixation rate of the calvin cycle . results show that the lack of vc in pv _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ko markedly disturbs chloroplast function at the recovery stage of heat shock stress . recovery of rfd and fv/fm after exposure to heat stress suggested that repair processes were activated in these plants . however fv/fm and rfd _PROTEIN_ dramatically in pv _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ko especially at the recovery stage . the weak recovery of pv _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ko reflected that vc plays a crucially important role in chloroplast _LOCATION_ repair under heat stress conditions . the possible involvement of vc in _LOCATION_ repair prompted us further to examine whether _PROTEIN_ over _PROTEIN_ protects chloroplasts against heat shock and recovery . in this attempt _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ constitutively by a camv promoter in a col background _PROTEIN_ . based on immunoblots we verified that _PROTEIN_ accumulated high levels of _PROTEIN_ compared to col fig . a and b . resolution of chloroplast proteins in a native _PROTEIN_ gel followed by second dimension _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ revealed that over _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ formed high mr supercomplexes which are similar to those of endogenous _PROTEIN_ . as expected detached leaves from _PROTEIN_ lines showed faster recovery of rfd and fv/fm after heat treatment and recovery than those of col suggesting that _PROTEIN_ indeed acts in protecting chloroplast _LOCATION_ . based on these results we concluded that ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ enhances tolerance of arabidopsis against heat shock stress .
