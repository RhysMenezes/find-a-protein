the arabidopsis type cyclin _PROTEIN_ also named tardy asynchronous meiosis _PROTEIN_ is known for its positive role in meiotic cell cycle progression but its function in other cells has not been characterized . this paper reports the role of _PROTEIN_ in differentiated cells in vegetative organs . the pattern of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was investigated by promoter and protein fusions using the _PROTEIN_ and the green _METHOD_ protein respectively . the relevance of the promoter region used in these gene fusion constructs was verified by the effective complementation of the phenotype of the diploid null allele tam by a genomic fragment containing the wild type coding region of _PROTEIN_ and the promoter region . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was found primarily in non proliferating cells such as guard cells trichomes and mesophyll cells and in vascular tissue . in two types of overexpression lines one containing the _PROTEIN_ transgene driven by the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ promoter and the other _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter the largest differences between the transgene transcript levels were approximately and folds respectively but the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal levels in the mesophyll and stomata in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines only differ slightly . furthermore the _METHOD_ signals in the mesophyll and stomata in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines were all at similarly low levels . these results indicate that the _PROTEIN_ protein is likely _PROTEIN_ at low levels in these cells through post transcriptional regulation . loss of function in _PROTEIN_ resulted in increases in the _LOCATION_ size in both trichomes and guard cells . surprisingly overexpression of _PROTEIN_ led to similar increases . the large increases in trichome _LOCATION_ size likely reflected ploidy increases while the moderate increases in guard cell _LOCATION_ size did not justify for a ploidy increase . these _LOCATION_ size increases were not clearly correlated with trichome branch number increases and guard cell size increases respectively . these results suggest that cellular homeostasis of the _PROTEIN_ protein is linked to the control of _LOCATION_ sizes in trichomes and guard cells .
it was previously reported that a bp genomic fragment containing the bp promoter region of _PROTEIN_ complemented the meiotic defect in the tam allele which contains a point mutation and retains a certain level of _PROTEIN_ function . because the same promoter region was used to create the gus and _METHOD_ fusions and the tam null allele was primarily used in phenotypic comparisons with other plants in this investigation the same genomic fragment was tested for complementation of the defects in tam . seeds from a plant heterozygous for tam were first selected on the _METHOD_ agar medium supplemented with kanamycin which enabled the selection of both heterozygous and homozygous tam plants . transformation of these plants in four separate pots was then conducted with the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ construct that contained the bp genomic fragment . it was predicted that the tam heterozygous plants would produce diploid tam transformants and the tam homozygous plants would produce triploid and tetraploid tam transformants due to the meiotic defect in tam _LOCATION_ . indeed among nine plants identified as homozygous tam by pcr four were diploid two were triploid and three were tetraploid according to the guard cell _LOCATION_ sizes _PROTEIN_ . the four diploid were from three independent transformation events and the three tetraploid from two independent transformation events . these diploid and tetraploid were subject to further phenotypic characterization . figure b show normal meiotic products and a _PROTEIN_ meiotic product from the wild type and diploid tam respectively . all the identified plants produced normal tetrads . these results indicate that the transgene complemented the meiotic production of _PROTEIN_ tam . therefore the bp promoter region of _PROTEIN_ likely enabled the _PROTEIN_ of the transgene in a spatio temporal pattern comparable to that of the endogenous _PROTEIN_ . to investigate the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in vegetative organs we first studied the _PROTEIN_ pattern of a _PROTEIN_ gus reporter gene in the wild type seedlings . four such independent reporter lines showed similar gus staining patterns although their _PROTEIN_ levels seemed to vary . the strongest gus signal was found in the vascular tissue of cotyledons leaves the hypocotyl and roots but no signal was detected in leaf primordia the shoot apical meristem and the root apical meristem . the gus signal in the vascular tissue in the root followed a gradient of a strong signal at the hypocotyl root junction to no signal near the root tip . the gus signal appeared to be associated with the phloem or parenchyma in the vascular tissue in the root . in cotyledons and leaves the gus signal was present in the epidermis and the mesophyll with some regions more intense than others and the region near the cotyledon and leaf margins often exhibiting overall weak staining . there are small patches of strong gus staining in the cotyledons and leaves which involved both the epidermis and the underneath mesophyll . these patches situated either away from a vascular bundle or near a vascular bundle and each consisted of a few cells surrounding a stoma . stomata and pavement cells in other regions were either moderately _PROTEIN_ or weakly _PROTEIN_ gus stained . in addition the gus signal was observed in trichomes . these observations indicate that _PROTEIN_ is predominantly _PROTEIN_ in differentiated cells in the vascular tissue the mesophyll and the epidermis and that the activation of the _PROTEIN_ is coordinated between the epidermis and the underneath mesophyll . to further examine and confirm the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ we carried out detailed characterization of the _METHOD_ signals in the vegetative organs in three independent _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic lines that were previously described in the study of the meiotic function of _PROTEIN_ . consistent with the gus staining results the levels of the _METHOD_ signals in the mesophyll appeared to be higher in the three _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines than in the non transgenic col control . similarly the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines also appeared to have higher levels of _METHOD_ in the guard cells than col . to obtain an objective assessment of the _METHOD_ signal levels the levels of the _METHOD_ in the mesophyll and guard cells were quantified by average green intensity using the sigmascan pro software . in this quantification the entire micrographs of the palisade mesophyll and guard cell areas that are devoid of chloroplasts and away from the cell wall region bordering the stomatal pore _METHOD_ were measured . these measurements indicate that the transgenic plants did have significantly higher levels of _METHOD_ than the negative control in the mesophyll and guard cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ also appeared to be in the root vascular tissue although it was difficult to quantify the _METHOD_ levels due to _METHOD_ in the vascular tissue . it was also difficult to visualize and quantify the differences in the _METHOD_ signals in trichomes between the negative control and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines due to the interference of variable _METHOD_ levels from different areas of trichome cell walls . the above observations indicate that the _METHOD_ signal levels although present at least in mesophyll and guard cells were low or moderate . to determine if an artificial increase in its transcript level can increase its protein production and to investigate the effect of _PROTEIN_ overexpression in arabidopsis we generated two types of transgenic plants the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines and the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines . the _PROTEIN_ promoter has been described before and is a strong promoter for ubiquitous transcription _PROTEIN_ . the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter is also expected to drive high levels of transcription in almost all cells . the transcript levels of each of the transgenes in three independent lines were first quantified using rna samples from week old seedlings and rt qpcr . the levels of the _PROTEIN_ transcript in the three _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines were ranged from to folds of that in the wild type control while it was to folds of the control level in the three _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines . these results indicate that the _PROTEIN_ promoter and the promoter had similar effects on the transcription of the transgenes respectively . we next examined the _METHOD_ signals in the three _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines . the _METHOD_ signals appeared sporadically in the root apical meristem in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines and such signals were not detected in the negative control and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines . these observations further indicate that _PROTEIN_ is not _PROTEIN_ at an appreciable level in the root apical meristem in the wild type . the spotty appearance of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in fig . indicates that the promoter drove ectopic _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the root apical meristem . the spotty appearance of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ also resembles the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ in the root apical meristem suggesting that the dynamics of the ectopic _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is similarly regulated as other mitotic cyclins in the root apical meristem . by the same method as described earlier the _METHOD_ signals in the mesophyll and guard cells in the three _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines were quantified . surprisingly the _METHOD_ signals were also weak only the _METHOD_ signal levels in the mesophylls of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and and in the guard cells of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were statistically different from those of the negative control . the ranking of the average green _METHOD_ intensities among the three lines in fig . corresponds to that of the transcriptional levels of _PROTEIN_ in fig . and the average green _METHOD_ intensities were similar to those in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines . also striking is that the ratio of the mrna transcript levels in the seedlings of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines is whereas the ratios of the average green intensities in the mesophyll and guard cells in these lines are only and respectively . these results indicate that the promoter did not lead to large increases in the levels of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the mesophyll and guard cells despite the large increases in the mrna transcript in the seedlings of these lines . the average green intensity values however do reflect in a small way their transcript levels in the seedlings . furthermore the _PROTEIN_ promoter and the promoter led to similar levels of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the mesophyll and guard cells although the promoter appeared somewhat weaker than the _PROTEIN_ promoter in the guard cells . taken together a post transcriptional mechanism _METHOD_ to exist to _PROTEIN_ low levels of the _PROTEIN_ protein in differentiated cells . to understand the function of _PROTEIN_ in vegetative organs we first investigated by flow cytometric analysis the ploidy profiles of the first mature rosette leaves of tam tam and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in comparison with that in col tam complement and col . the proportions of _LOCATION_ at the ploidy levels ranging from to were not statistically different between col and tam complement . among the proportions of the six ploidy levels only the proportion of _LOCATION_ was statistically higher in tam when it is compared with col . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ on the other hand had higher proportions of and _LOCATION_ but a lower proportion of _LOCATION_ than col . when the same comparison was conducted between tam and col no statistical difference was detected between the two genotypes for _LOCATION_ with ploidy levels ranging from to . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is not required for endoreduplication in most if not all cells in the leaves although when artificially upregulated it can reduce the proportion of high ploidy cells while increasing the proportion of low ploidy cells . because some cells such as trichomes might not be adequately represented in the data in fig . we next examined individual trichomes on the adaxial side of the first and second rosette leaves in week old col tam tam complement tam tam complement lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ col tam tam complement lines and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was not included in this and subsequent phenotypic studies because it was identified as an octaploid line according to the guard cell _LOCATION_ size octaploid plants were found to have unstable genomes that may complicate phenotypic characterizations . it is not surprising that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines can become polyploid since the transgenes can cause unreduced gametes even when they are hemizygous . in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is a tetraploid line which was included as an example of _PROTEIN_ overexpression for comparison with tam . both tam and tam exhibited on average larger trichome _LOCATION_ than the col controls at both the diploid and tetraploid levels while trichome _LOCATION_ in the tam complementation lines were either statistically the same as or even smaller than those of the col controls . these results indicate that the loss of function of _PROTEIN_ resulted in increases in trichome _LOCATION_ size and the transgene complemented the trichome _LOCATION_ size defect in tam in both the and backgrounds . however the same transgene did not complement such a defect in tam . surprisingly all the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines except _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ whose average trichome _LOCATION_ size was not statistically different from that of col also exhibited larger average trichome _LOCATION_ sizes than the col controls . despite the significant differences in _LOCATION_ size among these lines the trichomes in these lines appeared to have comparable branch number distributions only the average trichome branch number in tam was slightly reduced in comparison with that in col . figure r shows representative trichome _LOCATION_ in the lines studied . taken together both the loss of function and overexpression of _PROTEIN_ led to trichome _LOCATION_ size increases that had little impact on trichome branch numbers . because _PROTEIN_ is also _PROTEIN_ in the guard cells we next investigated guard cell _LOCATION_ sizes and stomatal perimeters in cotyledons of week old plants of the same plant lines . we used the stomatal perimeter not the stomatal area as an indicator of stomatal size because the stomatal area greatly varies with the extent of stomatal pore opening . similar to the trichome _LOCATION_ size increases the loss of function and overexpression of _PROTEIN_ also caused _LOCATION_ size increases in the guard cells but the increases were only in tam _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . it _METHOD_ that only very high levels of _PROTEIN_ overexpression could result in guard cell _LOCATION_ size increases since _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ had much higher _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ than _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ respectively . the values of average trichome _LOCATION_ size in the affected tam and overexpression lines surpassed that of col justifying for ploidy level increases . the increases in the affected guard cells on the other hand did not justify for ploidy level increases . the correlation between guard cell _LOCATION_ size and stomatal perimeter was not consistent larger average _LOCATION_ sizes were not always correlated with larger stomatal perimeters and similar average guard cell _LOCATION_ sizes could nonetheless be linked to different average stomatal perimeters . figure p shows representative guard cell _LOCATION_ in of the plant lines studied including tam of which two showed complementation of the _LOCATION_ size defect . it is thus concluded that both the loss of function and high levels of _PROTEIN_ overexpression resulted in moderate _LOCATION_ size increases in guard cells in diploid plants .
all plant materials are arabidopsis thaliana in the columbia ecotype background . the _PROTEIN_ gus lines the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines and the tam complementation lines are new to this investigation and all the other plant lines have been previously described . all plants except for the plants for the flow cytometric study were grown on murashige and skoog medium supplemented with agar and sucrose in growth chambers set for and a h light and h dark regime . plants for the flow cytometric study were grown on artificial soil in a greenhouse as previously described . six day and older seedlings were incubated in the gus staining solutions at for approximately days . the gus staining solution contained mm potassium ferricyanide and mm potassium ferrocyanide to suppress false signals resulting from the diffusion from the truly positive cells to neighboring negative cells . additional details about the procedure and the composition of the gus staining solution can be found in sundaresan et al . . cotyledons and the first leaves on day or older seedlings were fixed and stored in ethanol and used for the studies of _LOCATION_ and cellular morphologies and sizes . fresh cotyledons from seedlings of comparable ages were used for the _METHOD_ analysis . bright field and differential interference contrast microscopy and _METHOD_ microscopy were conducted either on a nikon or a nikon microscope and the images were acquired using a digital camera and the camera manufacturer supplied software . all the _METHOD_ images used for quantification of the _METHOD_ signals were taken with s exposure which did not incur overexposure . confocal laser scanning _METHOD_ microscopy was conducted according to manufacturer s protocol for _METHOD_ setting . samples were mounted in water and the z series were recorded with a step _PROTEIN_ of and a total of twenty optical sections . for stomatal perimeter measurements the fixed cotyledons were stained with sudan black for min prior to photographing on the microscope . for examination and measurement of trichome and guard cell _LOCATION_ a diamidino phenylindole solution was used to stain fixed samples for h at room temperature and then the epidermises were examined and photographed using the blue _METHOD_ channel for dapi staining . all light microscopy photographs of stomata were from the abaxial epidermises of the cotyledons . manipulations of digital images were done in adobe photoshop . some dapi stained images were modestly adjusted for brightness and/or contrast . all the _METHOD_ images shown were not adjusted for brightness contrast or color . the _METHOD_ intensity values were the average green intensity values in defined areas obtained with the tracing tool in sigmascan pro . _LOCATION_ sizes and stomatal perimeters were obtained by the same tool . the bp promoter region in the _PROTEIN_ gus construct is the same as in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ construct for tam and tam complementation . the _PROTEIN_ promoter in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is a bp fragment upstream of the start codon of the _PROTEIN_ gene . the pcr primers corresponding to the specified genomic or plasmid regions with appropriate flanking restriction enzyme sites were used to amplify and clone the fragments . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was first cloned into an intermediate vector and subsequently into . for creating _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ full length _PROTEIN_ cdna was cloned into the pentr gateway vector and recombined with the binary destination vector . plant transformation was carried out with the agrobacterial strain as previously described . rna sample preparation and the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction experiment for generating fig . was conducted as previously described . to produce the quantitative real time rt pcr results shown in fig . total rnas were isolated using an rneasy plant mini kit and reverse transcribed with a quantitect reverse transcription kit that also has the ability to eliminate genomic dna in the rna sample . rt qpcrs were performed using a sybr green pcr kit with a light cycler . pcr amplifications were completed with a melting curve analysis to confirm the specificity of amplification and lack of primer dimers . pcr efficiencies were calculated based on a serial dilution . the _PROTEIN_ gene was used as a reference . software version was used for analysis of the pcr reactions . three rna samples were independently isolated for each plant line and four technical repeats of the pcr were conducted for each sample . primer sequences are aaaaccatggaatgctacgc and gggacaaagcttctttgctg for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ . flow cytometric analysis was conducted with the fifth rosette leaves from week or older plants as previously described .
