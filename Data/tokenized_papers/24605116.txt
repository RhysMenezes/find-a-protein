programmed cell death is a genetically determined process in all multicellular _METHOD_ . plant pcd is effected by a unique group of papain type cysteine endopeptidases with a c terminal kdel _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ retention signal . kdel cyseps can be stored as pro enzymes in _LOCATION_ derived endomembrane compartments and are released as mature cyseps in the final stages of organelle disintegration . kdel cyseps accept a wide variety of amino acids at the active site including the glycosylated hydroxyprolines of the extensins that form the basic scaffold of the cell wall . in arabidopsis three kdel cyseps are _PROTEIN_ . cell and tissue specific activities of these three genes suggest that kdel cyseps participate in the abscission of flower organs and in the collapse of tissues in the final stage of pcd as well as in developmental tissue remodeling . we observed that is _PROTEIN_ in response to biotic stress stimuli in the leaf . knockout mutants showed enhanced susceptibility to powdery mildew caused by the biotrophic ascomycete _LOCATION_ cruciferarum . a translational fusion protein of with a three fold hemaglutinin tag and the green _METHOD_ protein under control of the endogenous promoter _METHOD_ rescued the pathogenesis phenotype demonstrating the function of in restriction of powdery mildew . the spatiotemporal reporter _PROTEIN_ during fungal infection together with microscopic inspection of the interaction phenotype suggested a function of in controlling _PROTEIN_ stages of compatible interaction including _PROTEIN_ epidermal cell death . additionally _PROTEIN_ of stress response genes appeared to be deregulated in the interaction of mutants and e. cruciferarum . possible functions of in restricting parasitic success of the obligate biotrophic powdery mildew fungus are discussed .
two insertion lines and have the t dna insertion within the exon . both lines were homozygous and rt pcr using primers that amplified the coding region confirmed the knock out of . wild type plants and the two homozygous knock out mutants were inoculated with conidia of the powdery mildew fungus e. cruciferarum an obligate biotroph that requires living cells for growth . five week old plants were inoculated for evaluation of disease progression . arabidopsis susceptibility to e. cruciferarum was scored by visual examination of the whole plant and days after inoculation . both independent knock out mutants lines exhibited the same phenotype that is enhanced susceptibility to e. cruciferarum as compared to the parental wild type as can be seen by visual examination of the whole plant for scoring the leaf area covered by powdery mildew _METHOD_ . both mutants and harboring the t dna insertion in the exon represents loss of function mutants . no corresponding transcript could be

including _METHOD_ with and without the mature subunit . the final plasmid constructs were sequenced and transformed into agrobacterium tumefaciens for subsequent transformation into knock out plants in order to obtain plants _PROTEIN_ the functional or non functional reporter proteins respectively . eight homozygous transformants for each construct were obtained . three transformants for each

red arrows indicate proven or predicted protein cleavage sites . five week old plants were inoculated with the powdery mildew fungus e. cruciferarum and were scored for disease progression by visual examination of the whole plant and days post inoculation plants were distributed in the three categories of susceptibility with less than and more than of infected leaf area . significantly more plants of the knock out line were classified in the category with > diseased leaf area compared to control plants . this was particularly obvious at _PROTEIN_ stages of the interaction resulting in a super susceptibility phenotype of the mutants . by contrast knock out plants transformed with the functional reporter construct reporter pre pro _METHOD_ kdel exhibited a similar basal resistance to e. cruciferarum as compared to wild type plants thus proving the functionality of the reporter protein and complementation of the mutant phenotype . on the other hand knock out plants transformed with the non functional reporter construct reporter pre pro _METHOD_ kdel behaved similar to the original knock out plants in showing super susceptibility . disease _METHOD_ of wild type and mutant plants upon leaf infection with _LOCATION_ cruciferarum spores . wild type plants and plants transformed with the functional construct pre pro _METHOD_ kdel that are comparable to wild type plants and mutant

immunoblot analysis with anti ha antibodies . pro _METHOD_ kdel was detectable from day on post inoculation and disappeared after day . typically two distinct protein bands are recognized by the anti ha antibodies . both proteins exhibit with molecular _METHOD_ smaller than the kda marker the expected sizes based on their sequence with a calculated _METHOD_ of kda and thus probably represent the intact pro form of with the c terminal kdel motif still attached however in different conformation . this double band was already found for the analogous pro mcherry kdel reporter protein _PROTEIN_ .

intracellular haustoria . pictures are maximum projections of optical sections or optical sections respectively with increments . visual examination of wild type and mutant plants upon infection with e. cruciferarum suggested a role for in restricting the development of a biotrophic fungus . to assess the knock out phenotype on a microscopic level we used two different labels red _METHOD_ wheat germ agglutinin that stains the chitin of fungal hyphae and methyl blue that stains the callose at papillae and encasements of established haustoria as well as whole cells that die in the course of epidermal hr like cell death . at fungal colonies on the wild type were grown to a size that about haustoria were established per single fungal colony . in an average colony fungal attempts to penetrate were associated with localized callose depositions without a visible haustorium . more than cells per fungal colony displayed whole cell callose deposition indicative of cell death which was associated with fungal infection structures in most cases collapsed haustoria . by contrast the mutant displayed significantly less epidermal cell death per fungal colony and at the same time supported the development of more haustoria in living cells . hence the mutants displayed a failure to restrict establishment or _PROTEIN_ of fungal haustoria under execution of an hr like epidermal cell death . wild type plants exhibit significantly more dead epidermal cells and less established haustoria as compared to mutants upon inoculation with _LOCATION_ cruciferarum . microscopic
