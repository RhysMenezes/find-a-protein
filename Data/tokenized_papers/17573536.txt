ubiquitination plays important roles in plant hormone signal transduction . we show that the _PROTEIN_ finger ligase arabidopsis thaliana salt _PROTEIN_ drought _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is involved in abscisic acid related stress signal transduction . _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in all tissues of arabidopsis and is upregulated by drought and salt stress but not by aba . plants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ reporter construct confirmed strong induction of gus _PROTEIN_ in stomatal guard cells and leaf mesophyll cells under drought stress . the green _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ fusion protein is colocalized with intracellular _LOCATION_ . we demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is an ubiquitin ligase and that the _PROTEIN_ finger conservation region is required for its activity . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ leads to aba hypersensitivity and aba associated phenotypes such as salt hypersensitivity in germination enhanced aba induced stomatal closing and enhanced drought tolerance . the _PROTEIN_ levels of a number of key aba and stress marker genes are altered both in _PROTEIN_ overexpression and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . cross complementation experiments showed that the aba _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ binding _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes can rescue the aba insensitive phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutant whereas _PROTEIN_ could not rescue the _PROTEIN_ mutant . this suggests that _PROTEIN_ acts upstream of those basic leucine zipper family genes . our results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is a positive regulator of aba signaling .
in order to identify stress related arabidopsis single subunit ligase genes in silico gene _PROTEIN_ of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ finger genes was analyzed in several publicly available stress related microarray studies . among _PROTEIN_ finger proteins and u box subfamily proteins analyzed from arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ finger gene attracted our interest . microarray data indicated that its transcript was induced to high levels after salt and drought stress treatment and this was _PROTEIN_ confirmed by rna gel blot analysis . the microarray results suggested that _PROTEIN_ was involved in stress response . to verify the microarray _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ results and to check whether _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is regulated by other abiotic stresses week old arabidopsis seedlings were subjected to different stress treatments and rna was prepared for rna gel blot analysis . as shown in figure the transcript level of _PROTEIN_ was upregulated by drought and nacl but not by aba . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ increased by approximately fivefold at the h point of the drought treatment course . rt pcr analysis detected _PROTEIN_ in all tissues of arabidopsis including leaves _METHOD_ roots siliques and flowers . to determine the _PROTEIN_ pattern in detail we analyzed the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ fusion . this consisted of a kb dna fragment upstream of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ start codon fused with the gus gene transforming the construct into wild type arabidopsis . histochemical staining revealed gus activity at all developmental stages tested from seed germination to flowering . this confirmed that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ at all developmental stages and throughout the arabidopsis plant . gus _PROTEIN_ was first detected in d old germinated seeds with stronger gus staining in the emerging radicle . gus _PROTEIN_ was also detected at the root tip and in the root hair differentiation zone of and d old seedlings . at d gus _PROTEIN_ was detected throughout the plant with the exception of the hypocotyl . gus activity was also observed in the flowers with stronger gus staining observed in pollen grains . interestingly strong gus staining was also observed in guard cells of both young and mature leaves under normal growth conditions . once we determined that _PROTEIN_ is upregulated by drought and nacl we next tested whether the _PROTEIN_ promoter is responsible for this upregulation . the _PROTEIN_ promoter gus reporter construct provided a useful tool for identifying the promoter required for the response to drought and nacl . gus activity increased throughout the plant and especially in the roots after h in drought conditions and h of mm nacl treatment . a substantial increase in gus activity was also detected not only in guard cells but also in entire leaves after drought treatment . _PROTEIN_ encodes a protein of amino acids with a predicted molecular _METHOD_ of kd . two putative transmembrane domains were predicted by the smart program . the two domains were located at the n terminus of the _PROTEIN_ protein between and amino acids and and amino acids respectively . to determine whether two putative transmembrane domains predicted in _PROTEIN_ are functional the myc _PROTEIN_ full length protein and a truncated form myc _PROTEIN_ with the transmembrane domain deleted were transiently _PROTEIN_ in nicotiana benthamiana leaf cells . cell fractionation and protein gel blot assays showed that both myc _PROTEIN_ and myc _PROTEIN_ are present in total cell extract . the full length myc _PROTEIN_ was detected exclusively in the microsomal fraction but not in the soluble fraction . the major part of myc _PROTEIN_ was detected in the soluble fraction . however a small amount was detected in the _LOCATION_ fraction which could be due to a trace of unground cell/tissue contamination in the microsomal fraction . the association of myc _PROTEIN_ with the intracellular _LOCATION_ was further confirmed by resuspension in different detergent free and detergent containing buffers for extensive cell fractionation analysis . _PROTEIN_ was always detected only in the microsomal fractions and removed from the microsomal fractions by detergent treatment . therefore we concluded that _PROTEIN_ is associated with the intracellular _LOCATION_ . to confirm the association of _PROTEIN_ with the intracellular _LOCATION_ we checked the subcellular localization of the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein . we constructed a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion under the control of a cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . to verify whether the _METHOD_ tag affects the function of the _PROTEIN_ protein both the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion and _PROTEIN_ were introduced into arabidopsis . both constructs exhibited the same phenotypes such as aba hypersensitivity demonstrating that the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion is a functional protein . transient _PROTEIN_ in onion epidermal cells demonstrated that _METHOD_ alone was found in both the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ whereas _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was found densely localized in intracellular _LOCATION_ probably _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ bound in cells as _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ accumulates in the _LOCATION_ compared with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the plasmolysis results indicated that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localized in intracellular components rather than in cell walls . this is consistent with the predicted transmembrane domains in the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ . previous research showed that _PROTEIN_ finger containing proteins can function as ligases . the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ contains a conserved type _PROTEIN_ domain comprising conserved cys and his residues . therefore we speculated that _PROTEIN_ also had ligase activity . to test this hypothesis we produced _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli as a fusion protein with maltose binding protein and affinity purified mbp _PROTEIN_ from the soluble fraction . in the presence of wheat and a human ubiquitination activity was observed in the presence of purified mbp _PROTEIN_ . due to the presence of crude extract of and in the reaction the ubiquitination ladders detected by nickel horseradish peroxidase could be any proteins including _PROTEIN_ and mbp tag in the reaction mixture . furthermore the anti mbp blot analysis indicated that at least mbp _PROTEIN_ was ubiquitinated . however in the absence of and no polyubiquitination was detected indicating that _PROTEIN_ has ligase activity . the _PROTEIN_ motif is essential for the ligase activity of _PROTEIN_ finger proteins . therefore we tested whether an intact _PROTEIN_ finger domain was required for _PROTEIN_ ligase activity . a single amino acid substitution allele was produced by mutagenizing his to tyr as this mutation might disrupt the _PROTEIN_ domain . an in vitro ubiquitination assay indicated that the ligase activity was completely abolished in the mutant of _PROTEIN_ demonstrating that an intact _PROTEIN_ domain is required for _PROTEIN_ ligase activity . analysis of the full length cdna and the genomic sequences revealed that _PROTEIN_ is composed of eight exons and seven introns . the gene is located on chromosome iii of the arabidopsis genome . to discover the in vivo functions of _PROTEIN_ we applied reverse genetics and overexpression approaches . first the loss of function mutant of the _PROTEIN_ gene two independent t dna insertion lines _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were identified from the _PROTEIN_ seed stock center . the t dna insertion positions are illustrated in figure and homozygous mutants were verified by diagnostic pcr using _PROTEIN_ gene specific and t dna border primers . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ null alleles were confirmed by rt pcr and rna gel blot analysis for loss of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . on murashige and skoog _METHOD_ growth medium no obvious differences were observed between the wild type and the two _PROTEIN_ mutants at the germination stage . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ showed identical phenotypes exhibiting a longer primary root at _PROTEIN_ growth stages compared with wild type plants but similar to the wild type in the number of _PROTEIN_ roots and aerial parts . the difference in primary root length between the wild type and mutants was observed over the entire growth time course . to confirm whether the phenotypes of the _PROTEIN_ mutants were indeed due to lost _PROTEIN_ function _PROTEIN_ was only overexpressed in the _PROTEIN_ mutant since both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are null alleles with the same phenotype . all phenotypes such as root length and nacl and aba insensitivity were rescued in complementation lines . thus the _PROTEIN_ null mutant was used for all further phenotype comparisons and cross complementary analysis . the function of _PROTEIN_ was further investigated by analysis of _PROTEIN_ overexpressing phenotypes . the coding region of _PROTEIN_ was introduced into the transgenic vector under the control of the camv promoter and into wild type arabidopsis to produced transgenic lines overexpressing _PROTEIN_ . five independent homozygous lines were recovered and lines with high levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ confirmed by rna gel blot analysis showed similar phenotypes . similar to the _PROTEIN_ mutants no obvious differences were observed between the wild type and _PROTEIN_ at the germination stage on _METHOD_ medium . the _PROTEIN_ plants exhibited shorter primary roots and slightly smaller aerial parts than wild type plants at seedling growth stages on plates while no obvious differences in aerial parts were observed on soil grown plants . the opposite phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ overexpression plants indicate that _PROTEIN_ is involved in root growth control under normal growth conditions . salts inhibit germination and seedling growth in a concentration dependent manner . since _PROTEIN_ is a salt induced gene it is probable that _PROTEIN_ plays a role in plant responses to salt . the _PROTEIN_ transgenic and _PROTEIN_ mutant seeds were germinated on medium containing mm nacl and differences were observed at both germination and postgerminative growth stages . seeds of both mutants germinated much earlier than in the wild type . after d only of wild type seeds germinated but of _PROTEIN_ and of _PROTEIN_ seeds germinated . seedlings of both mutants also grew faster than wild type seedlings with longer primary roots bigger cotyledons and earlier true leaf emergence in and respectively of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings . germination of _PROTEIN_ seeds was much delayed at d only of _PROTEIN_ seeds germinated but nearly of wild type seeds germinated . in _PROTEIN_ cotyledon greening and expansion as well as root growth of _PROTEIN_ were also inhibited at the postgermination stage and at d only of the seedlings had small green cotyledons . similar results were observed when plants were grown in medium with mm kcl while no obvious difference was detected when and mm licl was added . to distinguish whether _PROTEIN_ is involved in salt specific or general osmotic effects _PROTEIN_ transgenic and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants were germinated and grown on _METHOD_ medium with or without mm nacl and mm mannitol . the growth of _PROTEIN_ plants was strongly inhibited compared with wild type plants and _PROTEIN_ mutants upon nacl treatment . however no different effects among _PROTEIN_ wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants were observed on plates containing mannitol . these results suggest that the response to salt is ionic rather than osmotic . because _PROTEIN_ is induced by drought it is expected that the overexpression and mutant plants have altered responses to water deficit conditions . to test this week old _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants as well as wild type control plants were transplanted to growth on soil for an additional weeks . thereafter plants were not watered for d to induce drought stress . the plants were then rehydrated and photographed after d . before rewatering most of the wild type plants and all _PROTEIN_ mutant plants were withered but the _PROTEIN_ plants exhibited continued survival and growth . after rewatering the _PROTEIN_ plants exhibited a high survival rate whereas the corresponding survival rate was for wild type plants and none of the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants survived . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ enhanced drought tolerance while _PROTEIN_ gene knockout reduced drought tolerance . thus these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ plays an important role in plant drought response . the altered drought tolerance of _PROTEIN_ overexpression and _PROTEIN_ plants could be attributed at least in part to changes in transpiration rate . stomata control gas exchange and water evaporation . leaves from _PROTEIN_ wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants grown in soil were examined to determine stomatal aperture status . stomatal apertures were smaller on _PROTEIN_ leaves compared with wild type leaves while stomata on _PROTEIN_ leaves were almost fully open . as shown in figure of wild type stomata and of _PROTEIN_ stomata but only of _PROTEIN_ stomata were open . consistent with these results the fresh weight loss of detached rosette leaves in _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants was < as opposed to and for wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants respectively . this suggests that during dehydration the stomata of _PROTEIN_ plants can respond to water deficit better than wild type or _PROTEIN_ plants . stomatal closure is a key aba controlled process that determines the rate of transpiration under water deficit conditions . to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ is involved in aba related stomatal closure we treated leaves of three genotypes with aba to analyze stomatal aperture . indeed treating the leaf epidermis of _PROTEIN_ plants with aba caused complete closure of stomata the effect was not so pronounced in wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants . the _PROTEIN_ mutant guard cells clearly have an impaired response to aba whereas the guard cells of _PROTEIN_ plants show a remarkable increase in response to aba . thus _PROTEIN_ may play a crucial role in aba mediated guard cell control . aba plays an important role in regulating plant responses to different stresses . salt and drought responses in plants are triggered by increased levels of the phytohormone aba which leads to the activation of a series of aba dependent responses . nearly all aba deficient and aba insensitive mutants exhibit salt insensitivity during germination and are susceptible to drought because of impaired stomatal aperture regulation _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ while plants overexpressing the aba response pathway gene such as _PROTEIN_ binding _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are tolerant to drought and hypersensitive to salt . inhibitory experiments of seed germination have provided useful insights into components of aba signaling . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ overexpression and _PROTEIN_ affect aba response _PROTEIN_ transgenic and _PROTEIN_ plants were germinated and grown on _METHOD_ medium with aba to determine sensitivity . in the presence of aba cotyledon greening/expansion and root growth were severely inhibited in _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants . by contrast of the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants showed expanded and green cotyledons . wild type plants showed an intermediate phenotype with of the plants having expanded and green cotyledons . to test whether the effect was dosage dependent various concentrations of aba were added to the medium . the aba hypersensitive response of _PROTEIN_ occurred at concentrations as low as aba . when the aba concentration was > the growth of _PROTEIN_ plants was arrested completely after germination and none of the transgenic seedlings developed true leaves at d . at all concentrations tested _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants were hypersensitive to aba at both germination and postgerminative growth stages . the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants were less sensitive to aba than the wild type plants and the insensitivity could be reversed by _PROTEIN_ overexpression . the sensitivity occurred in a dosage dependent manner . no obvious differences were observed when all three groups of plants were germinated on _METHOD_ plates without aba in early growth stages . it can be concluded that _PROTEIN_ plants are hypersensitive while _PROTEIN_ plants possess reduced sensitivity to aba . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is involved in the aba response . downstream genes directly or indirectly regulated by _PROTEIN_ may be responsible for aba sensitivity in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants . to investigate the roles of _PROTEIN_ in transcriptional regulation in plants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants were treated or mock treated with aba to determine the _PROTEIN_ of several genes in different groups responsive to aba signaling . for group i the _PROTEIN_ gene encodes a phospholipase and _PROTEIN_ and its product phosphatidic acid regulate either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ to control stomatal closure and opening in the aba signaling pathway . when plants were treated with aba the induction pattern showed no obvious changes for the _PROTEIN_ gene or the _PROTEIN_ gene among the three types of plants while the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene a negative regulator of the aba response pathway in arabidopsis did not show any clear change in _PROTEIN_ overexpression plants but was reduced threefold in the _PROTEIN_ mutant compared with the wild type after a h treatment . two other _PROTEIN_ family members that encode phosphatase at _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have been detected but no obvious differences were found in either overexpression or mutant plants . we also tested the _LOCATION_ genes including the _PROTEIN_ binding transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . after the h treatment with aba _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ levels increased only slightly and fold respectively in _PROTEIN_ plants while almost no change was observed in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . however _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ clearly _PROTEIN_ by and fold respectively in the _PROTEIN_ plants . in contrast with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ only slightly fold after h of treatment with aba . the most notable reduction occurred in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . this suggests that _PROTEIN_ plays a role directly or indirectly in controlling the transcription of aba signaling pathway components . for group iii the _PROTEIN_ gene is a drought cold and aba inducible gene that contains dehydration responsive elements and aba responsive elements in its promoter region . however we could not find any significant differences in _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ between _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants . only a slight reduction fold compared with the wild type was observed in _PROTEIN_ plants after a long treatment . similar _PROTEIN_ patterns were also detected in the other dehydration responsive gene _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which encodes a protein similar to the nonstorage seed protein _PROTEIN_ of vicia faba . another aba responsive gene _PROTEIN_ encodes a dehydrin a member of a large family of proteins induced in response to low temperature and drought in both vegetative tissues and seeds and was also slightly reduced in _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ synthase _PROTEIN_ a rate limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of pro whose mrna is induced by drought salinity and aba is reduced by in _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type . likewise in our study the _PROTEIN_ plants had reduced levels of _PROTEIN_ transcript especially at _PROTEIN_ treatment stages _PROTEIN_ . different _PROTEIN_ patterns were detected for _PROTEIN_ which was downregulated in _PROTEIN_ overexpression plants _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ encodes an alcohol dehydrogenase and its _PROTEIN_ is induced by aba . this result is consistent with the reduction of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in plants overexpressing two _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . our results indicate that _PROTEIN_ acts upstream of _PROTEIN_ family transcription _PROTEIN_ that mediate aba signaling . transgenic plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ are hypersensitive to aba while _PROTEIN_ plants are aba insensitive . these phenotypes are similar to _PROTEIN_ overexpression and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . similar phenotypes were also observed in overexpression and mutant plants for two other _PROTEIN_ binding _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . to test whether _PROTEIN_ acts in the same or a different pathway to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we generated _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ under the control of a promoter . the _PROTEIN_ transgenes were confirmed by rna gel blot analysis . the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants are insensitive to aba at both germination and the postgerminative growth stage when placed on aba infused plates . overexpression of the _PROTEIN_ gene in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background resulted in different levels of rescue with the aba insensitive phenotype . germination and postgerminative growth varied across different lines . some were similar to the wild type having incomplete expansion of green cotyledons and short _PROTEIN_ roots indicative of aba sensitive recovery . others showed arrested growth at the seedling stage suggesting more sensitivity to aba than wild type plants . this may be due to overexpression of the gene under the control of the promoter . the different _PROTEIN_ levels of transgenes may contribute to the variation in response to aba . significant differences in _PROTEIN_ transcript levels in _PROTEIN_ lines and were detected . line had greater sensitivity to aba as well as higher _PROTEIN_ transcript levels compared with line . similar variations were observed in different _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines but after analyzing > lines of each construct no severe arrest transgenic lines were observed that were similar to _PROTEIN_ line . it _METHOD_ that _PROTEIN_ overexpression in _PROTEIN_ confers more aba sensitivity at the postgerminative growth stage than at the germination stage . for _PROTEIN_ overexpression in _PROTEIN_ lines at aba the germination ratio was not obviously _PROTEIN_ compared with _PROTEIN_ while postgerminative growth such as cotyledon greening/expansion and the development of true leaves was inhibited more severely . nevertheless _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ overexpression in _PROTEIN_ is involved in both germination and postgermination stages since the obvious inhibition of germination and postgerminative growth can be detected on both and aba . this is consistent with previous reports that those _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ have both redundant and distinct functions in aba response . however under normal growth conditions neither _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ nor _PROTEIN_ can totally restore the root phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutant which indicates that _PROTEIN_ may affect root length through pathways other than those controlled by _PROTEIN_ genes . therefore we surmise that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ can rescue the aba insensitivity of _PROTEIN_ in different aspects . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ can rescue the aba insensitivity of _PROTEIN_ which indicates that _PROTEIN_ may act upstream of these _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ . we conducted further studies to exclude the possibility that _PROTEIN_ functions in parallel with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . to do this we transformed _PROTEIN_ mutant plants with a _PROTEIN_ construct and generated _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines carrying a _PROTEIN_ transgene and confirmed them by rna gel blot analysis . all _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines showed the same phenotype as _PROTEIN_ mutants on _METHOD_ plates and remained insensitive to aba overcoming the aba inhibition phenotype . the effect was similar with and aba treatment . this demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ acted downstream rather than in parallel with _PROTEIN_ . we also created _PROTEIN_ overexpression transgenic plants for _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutant backgrounds . since the aba phenotypes of both mutants are not obvious under our experimental conditions it is difficult to analyze the cross complementation phenotype and the data are not presented .
