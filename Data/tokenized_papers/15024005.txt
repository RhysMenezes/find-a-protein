the subcellular distribution of met and s adenosylmethionine metabolism in plant cells discloses a complex partition between the _LOCATION_ and the organelles . in the present work we show that arabidopsis contains three functional _METHOD_ of vitamin _PROTEIN_ independent methionine synthase _METHOD_ the enzyme that catalyzes the methylation of homocysteine to met with methyltetrahydrofolate as methyl group donor . one _METHOD_ isoform is present in chloroplasts and is most likely required to methylate homocysteine that is synthesized de novo in this compartment . thus chloroplasts are autonomous and are the unique site for de novo met synthesis in plant cells . the additional _METHOD_ _METHOD_ are present in the _LOCATION_ and are most probably involved in the regeneration of met from homocysteine produced in the course of the activated methyl cycle . although met synthesis can occur in chloroplasts there is no evidence that adomet is synthesized anywhere but the _LOCATION_ . in accordance with this proposal we show that adomet is transported into chloroplasts by a carrier mediated facilitated diffusion process . this carrier is able to catalyze the uniport uptake of adomet into chloroplasts as well as the exchange between _LOCATION_ adomet and chloroplastic adomet or s adenosylhomocysteine . the obvious function for the carrier is to sustain methylation reactions and other adomet dependent functions in chloroplasts and probably to remove s adenosylhomocysteine generated in the stroma by methyltransferase activities . therefore the chloroplastic adomet carrier serves as a link between _LOCATION_ and chloroplastic one _PROTEIN_ metabolism .
arabidopsis contains three _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ independent _METHOD_ first goal of our study was to identify and characterize all the genes that may encode _METHOD_ in arabidopsis in particular _PROTEIN_ the occurrence of an hcy methylating enzyme in the chloroplast . a search in the arabidopsis information resource data base revealed three genes coding putative cobalamin independent _METHOD_ in the arabidopsis genome . the full length cdnas were obtained by rt pcr and designated _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ respectively . the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ cdnas encode residue polypeptides that are identical to each other and identical to other known _PROTEIN_ independent _METHOD_ from higher plants . the deduced _METHOD_ protein shares identity with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and other known plant _METHOD_ a summary of the primary sequences alignment using a similarity tree clearly indicates that _METHOD_ is apart from other plant cobalamin independent _METHOD_ proteins identified so far . when compared with _PROTEIN_ independent _METHOD_ from other _METHOD_ the _METHOD_ proteins are identical to mete from e. coli identical to from saccharomyces cerevisiae and identical to _PROTEIN_ independent _METHOD_ from chlamydomonas reinhardtii . to prove that the _METHOD_ clones encode functional _PROTEIN_ independent _METHOD_ enzymes the three arabidopsis cdnas were sub cloned into the _PROTEIN_ vector pet and introduced into the e. coli strain plyss . overexpression of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ led to soluble gene products comprising up to of the total cellular proteins . _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ in e. coli as a truncated protein with an n terminal residue deletion . the _PROTEIN_ protein was not an abundant protein in crude extracts but its presence in the soluble fraction was ascertained by western blot experiments . enzyme activity was determined using the non radioactive assay described by drummond et al . with as a substrate . by using our standard incubation conditions the bacterial endogenous mete activity was negligible compared with the activity measured when the plant proteins were _PROTEIN_ . as shown in table ii the three arabidopsis proteins are functional _PROTEIN_ independent _METHOD_ capable of methylating hcy to met with as methyl donor . the fold difference in activities between _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ on the one hand and _METHOD_ on the other hand is because of the relative abundance of the proteins in the e. coli crude extracts . the apparent km values for were for the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ enzymes and for _METHOD_ . the substrate specificity of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ independent _METHOD_ enzymes was further analyzed using the monoglutamate form of as methyl donor . as shown in table ii can not replace efficiently the polyglutamate substrate a ratio of at least in favor of the pentaglutamate being observed for _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . these properties are consistent with previous reports showing that the cobalamin independent _METHOD_ from e. coli yeast or higher plants are unable to accept as methyl donor . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ are present in the _LOCATION_ and the _METHOD_ is the only _PROTEIN_ independent _METHOD_ described in higher plants that is predicted to possess a targeting sequence . indeed analysis of the n terminal extension of _METHOD_ using the prediction softwares targetp and predotar revealed features typical for mitochondrial or chloroplastic transit peptides thus suggesting that this protein is targeted to the organelles . to verify this prediction we first analyzed the subcellular distribution of _PROTEIN_ independent _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in arabidopsis by western blot . a preliminary experiment indicated that antibodies rose against _METHOD_ cross reacted with both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ recombinant proteins . as shown in fig . total soluble extracts from arabidopsis or pea leaves contain two polypeptides of and kda respectively which react with the antibodies . the occurrence of these polypeptides was then analyzed in purified chloroplasts and mitochondria and in a _LOCATION_ enriched fraction . fig . clearly indicates that the high molecular weight _METHOD_ polypeptide is detected in the _LOCATION_ enriched fraction but not in the organellar fractions . in arabidopsis the low molecular weight _METHOD_ polypeptide was detectable in soluble proteins obtained from purified chloroplasts but was absent in purified mitochondria _PROTEIN_ . this immunological pattern was confirmed with organelles purified from pea plants developed in light or in the dark _LOCATION_ . thus these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ independent _METHOD_ is present in both the _LOCATION_ and the stromal space of _LOCATION_ . to analyze the subcellular localization of the _METHOD_ proteins in vivo the n terminal regions were fused upstream to the _METHOD_ marker protein . as shown in fig . the _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in arabidopsis protoplasts resulted in green _METHOD_ throughout the cytoplasm and the _LOCATION_ a pattern similar to the one observed with _METHOD_ alone . these results demonstrate that _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ are _LOCATION_ proteins . _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ fusion protein in protoplasts resulted in a pattern of green _METHOD_ that colocalized with the red _METHOD_ of chlorophyll . these data indicate that _METHOD_ contains a functional _LOCATION_ targeting sequence a result in good agreement with the western blot analysis shown in fig . . it should be noted that a small part of protoplasts transformed with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ displayed green _METHOD_ in chloroplasts and in punctate structures scattered throughout the _LOCATION_ . these small particles were identified as mitochondria . the physiological significance of this last finding is not known because western blots presented in fig . clearly indicate that mitochondria do not contain a _PROTEIN_ independent _METHOD_ isoform . also the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ fusion protein is under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter and thus very likely _PROTEIN_ at a high non physiological level in protoplasts a situation that may disturb the sorting machinery . _LOCATION_ and chloroplastic _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ have insight into the physiological function of the three _METHOD_ _METHOD_ we examined the _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ genes in different organs from arabidopsis by quantitative real time rt pcr . as shown in fig . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ mrnas were detected in all analyzed organs _METHOD_ demonstrating that the corresponding genes were transcriptionally active . in the growth conditions used the three genes displayed however considerably different steady state levels and _PROTEIN_ profiles . indeed the _METHOD_ mrna coding the first _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ isoform was the most abundant transcript in all organs with the highest level in flowers and the lowest level in roots . the _METHOD_ mrna coding the second _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ isoform largely followed the _METHOD_ mrna _PROTEIN_ pattern and was generally fold less abundant than _METHOD_ with the exception of flowers where the ratio is in favor of _METHOD_ . the _METHOD_ gene displayed a fairly constant and very low _PROTEIN_ level in _METHOD_ leaves flowers and siliques . in these organs the mrna coding the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ isoform is fold less abundant than the mrnas coding the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . the ratio is less marked in roots and in dry seeds where the steady state level of _METHOD_ mrna is fold lower than _METHOD_ and fold higher than _METHOD_ . to analyze the correlation between mrna and protein abundance western blots were realized using soluble protein extracts obtained from the different organs . as mentioned above the kda polypeptide detected by western blot corresponds to the chloroplastic _METHOD_ protein whereas the kda band most probably corresponds to the two _LOCATION_ proteins that are not distinguishable by size . to make sure that both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ are present in the high molecular weight band we separated a soluble protein extract from arabidopsis cells by two dimensional gel electrophoresis identified the _LOCATION_ protein by western blot and analyzed the protein spot of interest by _PROTEIN_ assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight _METHOD_ spectroscopy . the obtained peptide _METHOD_ map indicated that both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ proteins are present in the protein spot thus indicating that the immunolabeling of the kda band is representative of the two _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . comparison of the mrna and protein _PROTEIN_ patterns in fig . a and b indicated that there is no direct relationship between the accumulation of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and the transcription level of the _METHOD_ genes . indeed roots contain the lowest level of mrnas coding _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ but display a large amount of the _LOCATION_ enzymes . on the contrary dry seeds and more particularly flowers contain high levels of the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ transcripts but the corresponding proteins do not accumulate . a similar variation between mrna and protein levels is also observed for _METHOD_ . with the exception of seeds the mrna coding the chloroplastic _METHOD_ is present at very low levels in all organs but the immunolabeling of the protein is as strong as the one for the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . the opposite situation is observed in dry seeds where the _METHOD_ mrna is at least times more abundant than in other organs but the protein is barely detectable . to summarize these data indicate that the accumulation of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in arabidopsis organs is not only determined by the steady state level of the corresponding mrnas but also by post transcriptional events . chloroplasts import adomet by a facilitated diffusion the above mentioned results indicate that met synthesis can occur in chloroplasts there is no evidence that adomet is synthesized anywhere but the _LOCATION_ . this observation along with the presence of adomet dependent reactions in chloroplasts leads to the proposal that chloroplasts have to import adomet from the _LOCATION_ . to test this hypothesis we analyzed adomet uptake by intact spinach leaf chloroplasts using silicone oil filtering centrifugation . fig . shows the uptake kinetics obtained for various concentrations of _PROTEIN_ adomet . this figure indicates that adomet was taken up very rapidly by chloroplasts and leveled off after min under our experimental conditions . fig . also indicates that the final concentration of adomet reached in the stroma at the equilibrium is proportional to the concentration of adomet initially present in the incubation medium . we ascertained that the radioactive product incorporated into chloroplasts was adomet by co migration with authentic _PROTEIN_ adomet using thin layer chromatography . this analysis also indicated that under our experimental conditions _PROTEIN_ adomet was not used for methylation reactions in the chloroplast because _PROTEIN_ adohcy could not be detected . a plot of the initial rate of adomet uptake versus substrate concentration in the medium shows a saturable curve which is indicative of a carrier mediated transport . from these data the calculated apparent km and vmax values were and nmol mg chl min respectively . to investigate whether the transport of adomet across the chloroplast envelope is energy dependent uptake experiments were performed either in light or in darkness or with or without _PROTEIN_ mg . these treatments had no effect on the kinetic parameters of adomet uptake thus indicating that _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis or light induced transmembrane proton potential across the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was not involved . thus the uptake of adomet into chloroplasts is mediated by a facilitated diffusion process . adomet uptake into chloroplasts is inhibited by possibility that transport of adomet is mediated by the chloroplastic adenylate carrier an antiport that exchanges _LOCATION_ for stromal adenylic nucleotides was ruled out because _PROTEIN_ had no effect on the uptake of adomet . the addition of either met or hcy to the external medium did not lead to any modification of the kinetic parameters of the adomet carrier . our results argue therefore against the proposal that adomet is transported by putative met or hcy carriers . on the other hand the adohcy molecule that is formed during the course of adomet dependent methylation reactions was found to be a potent inhibitor of adomet uptake into chloroplasts . the uptake of adomet was measured in the presence of various concentrations of adohcy and the dixon plot presented in fig . shows that the inhibition is competitive . the apparent ki value calculated from the dixon plot was . this result indicates that adohcy in contrast with _PROTEIN_ met and hcy is well recognized by the adomet binding site of the carrier . adomet/adohcy counter exchanges take place across the chloroplast possibility that transport of adomet across the chloroplast envelope is mediated by a carrier acting as an antiport that exchanges external adomet for internal adohcy was tested by two complementary experiments . first chloroplasts were loaded with _PROTEIN_ adomet for min at cooled down at rapidly and extensively washed and incubated at into exchange medium containing either unlabeled adohcy or adomet . the kinetics of _PROTEIN_ adomet efflux shown in fig . indicate that radiolabeled adomet is released from chloroplasts in the absence of external adomet or adohcy with an initial rate of nmol mg chl min at . this result indicates that the adomet carrier is able to catalyze a unidirectional transport . also fig . shows that the addition of adomet or adohcy to the exchange medium caused an fold increase of the efflux of the chloroplastic _PROTEIN_ adomet as compared with the medium without substrate . these results indicate that exchanges between internal adomet and external adomet or adohcy had occurred . second we measured the uptake of _PROTEIN_ adomet into chloroplasts pre loaded with unlabeled adomet or adohcy . we have verified on separate experiments that the pre loading of chloroplasts with unlabeled adomet led to a significant increase in the stromal concentration of adomet from up to . also the pre loading of chloroplasts with adohcy led to an increase in the stromal concentration of adohcy from an undetectable value up to . the variations observed in the final concentrations of substrates in the stroma were attributable to the unidirectional transport of adomet or adohcy that occurred during the course of chloroplast washing . the pre loading of chloroplasts with either adomet or adohcy led to a marked stimulation of _PROTEIN_ adomet uptake into the chloroplasts . under standard conditions the influx is so rapid that it was difficult to measure accurately the initial rate of _PROTEIN_ adomet uptake into pre loaded chloroplasts . _PROTEIN_ the temperature from to led to a marked _PROTEIN_ in the maximum rate of adomet uptake so that we could determine that chloroplasts pre loaded with adomet and adohcy took up external adomet and times more rapidly than untreated chloroplasts respectively . these results indicate that external adomet is taken up by chloroplasts in counter exchange with adomet or adohcy .
