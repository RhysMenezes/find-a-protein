ubiquitin fold proteins are rapidly emerging as an important class of eukaryotic modifiers which often exert their influence by post translational addition to other intracellular proteins . despite assuming a common grasp three dimensional structure their functions are highly diverse because of distinct surface features and targets and include tagging proteins for selective breakdown _LOCATION_ import autophagic recycling vesicular trafficking _PROTEIN_ morphogenesis and the stress response . here we describe a novel family of _LOCATION_ anchored ub fold proteins that are present in animals filamentous fungi and plants . extending from the c terminus of the ub fold is typically a cysteine containing caax sequence that can direct the attachment of either a _PROTEIN_ farnesyl or a _PROTEIN_ geranylgeranyl moiety in vitro . modified _METHOD_ of several mubs were detected in transgenic arabidopsis thaliana suggesting that these mubs are prenylated in vivo . both cell fractionation and confocal microscopic analyses of arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mub fusions showed that the modified _METHOD_ are _LOCATION_ anchored with a significant enrichment on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . this _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ location was blocked in vivo in prenyltransferase mutants and by mevinolin which inhibits the synthesis of prenyl groups . in addition to the five mubs with caax boxes arabidopsis has one mub variant with a cysteine rich c terminus distinct from the caax box that is also _LOCATION_ anchored possibly through the attachment of a long chain acyl group . although the physiological role of mubs remain unknown the discovery of these prenylated _METHOD_ further expands the diversity and potential functions of ub fold proteins in eukaryotic biology .
identification of the mub an attempt to define the breadth of ub fold proteins in plants we searched the various genomic and proteomic data bases of arabidopsis for related structures . upon visual inspection of the protein data bank for proteins similar in size to ub we discovered the recently released three dimensional nmr structure for a amino acid protein derived from the arabidopsis locus _GENE_ . despite being only identical/similar in amino acid sequence to ub the _PROTEIN_ structure of _GENE_ clearly has the signature grasp fold with a four strand sheet cradling a long diagonal helix and capped by a second shorter helix . when pymol was used to align the and ub structures a c root mean square deviation of only was calculated between the two structures indicative of strong three dimensional similarity . however is distinct from ub by the presence of a seven residue n terminal extension several insertions that generate pronounced external loops in the _PROTEIN_ structure and a residue c terminal tail . blast searches using the sequence as a query identified five additional mub genes in the arabidopsis genome with the encoded proteins ranging in size from to amino acids and showing to identity to . expanded searches detected homologs in a variety of other eukaryotes for which sufficient genomic or _PROTEIN_ sequence tag sequence data were available . the list includes other plants animals and various filamentous fungi . literature reviews also revealed a brief description of d. melanogaster mub which suggested that it has a ub type fold . mub gene sequences were not evident in any prokaryotic genomes nor detectable in the genomes of the budding and fission yeasts saccharomyces cerevisiae and schizosaccharomyces pombe respectively suggesting that mubs are restricted to multicellular eukaryotes . rice like arabidopsis appears to _PROTEIN_ a small family of four mubs . in contrast most of the animal and fungal genomes were predicted to contain a single mub gene . the fungal representatives are distinct in containing long variable n terminal extensions which were not included in the alignment in fig . . these long extensions are weakly similar to each other but bear no resemblance to any other protein sequences/motifs in the data base . the most similar are the mub extensions from gibberellia zeae and magneportha grisea that share similarity/identity over the first amino acids . phylogenetic analysis of the mub family combined with representatives of other ub fold proteins/domains and the e. coli this and moad polypeptides showed that mubs cluster on separate clades from the other ub fold proteins . three _PROTEIN_ mub clades were apparent that separated the animal plant and fungal _METHOD_ . we found that the arabidopsis mubs clustered along with their rice orthologs into three subclades containing and and and and _METHOD_ . consistent with this pairing and genes are in predicted synteny blocks within the arabidopsis genome suggesting that each pair arose by a large scale chromosomal duplication . cdnas are available for many plant animal and fungal mubs indicating that the corresponding genes are transcriptionally active . _PROTEIN_ patterns of the arabidopsis mub genes presented in the genevestigator dna microarray est and _METHOD_ parallel signature sequences data bases revealed that all six loci are _PROTEIN_ with being the most active . there are and ests available for respectively . genevestigator data indicated that the _PROTEIN_ patterns of strongly overlap with the relative abundance of each transcript varying only slightly among all tissues examined . _PROTEIN_ two exceptions were which had a fold higher transcript level in stamens and which had a fold higher transcript level in senescing leaves . examining the mrna abundance for in response to various stimuli did not reveal any substantial changes in _PROTEIN_ except whose mrna levels rose in response to cycloheximide and ozone treatment and infection by the pathogens a. tumefaciens and myzus persicae . the significance of these changes awaits confirmation by other methods . protein sequence alignments of the collection with other members of the ub fold superfamily _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ revealed a contiguous region of homology encompassing the ub fold . a number of conserved residues are apparent including his and several lysines . the corresponding lysines are important in ub by serving as internal polymerization sites during ub chain formation . the most striking feature of the mubs was the presence of a canonical four amino acid caax box instead of the c terminal glycine domain found in most other ub fold proteins . caax boxes often signal the addition of prenyl groups suggesting that members of the mub family are not bound covalently to proteins but are modified with these long chain hydrophobic groups . similar to other proteins that are efficient substrates for prenylation the mub caax boxes are preceded by a series of basic residues . the only mub of the entire collection that did not contain an obvious caax box was it terminates in a cysteine rich cvclcfgarc motif that could instead be the thioester acceptor site for acylation possibly by the saturated _PROTEIN_ lipid palmitic acid . mub proteins can be prenylated in demonstrate that members of the mub family can be prenylated we tested recombinant versions from a variety of eukaryotes in vitro using an extract from arabidopsis cultured cells as a source of protein prenyltransferase activities and farnesyl pyrophosphate or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate as isoprenoid donors . as shown using various human ras derivatives this preparation has both pft and pggt i activities that conformed to the caax sequence specificity of these enzymes i.e . pft favors proteins where x is either serine cysteine methionine glutamine or alanine whereas pggt i favors proteins where x is leucine . we found that ras which had the caax box cysteine substituted for serine was not modified whereas ras with caim or cail c termini were preferentially modified with farnesyl or geranylgeranyl moieties respectively . when the six arabidopsis mubs and an assortment of animal mubs were tested similarly almost all could be prenylated in reactions dependent on the caax sequence . following a h incubation we detected farnesyl or geranylgeranyl derivatives for all the animal mubs and five of the six arabidopsis mubs when wild type proteins were used but not when mutant proteins in which the caax box cysteine was converted to serine were used . the human mouse xenopus drosophila and zebrafish mubs were preferentially modified with geranylgeranyl moieties in accord with the preference of pggt i for a leucine c terminal amino acid . likewise arabidopsis and with c terminal leucine residues were preferentially modified with geranylgeranyl moieties . and on the other hand were preferentially modified with farnesyl moieties in accord with the preference of pft for a methionine c terminal residue . the only exception was arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ . consistent with the absence of an obvious c terminal caax box the recombinant protein was poorly modified with either prenyl group . arabidopsis mubs are modified in the presence of a c terminal caax box and the in vitro assays strongly suggested that most members of the mub family are naturally prenylated . to detect indirectly this modification in vivo we exploited the observation that addition of either farnesyl or geranylgeranyl groups in conjunction with removal of the aax sequence increases the electrophoretic mobility of the modified proteins . here we _PROTEIN_ myc and _METHOD_ tagged versions of and which are presumed targets of pft and pggt i activities respectively with or without the essential cysteine in arabidopsis and assayed for the prenylated _METHOD_ by faster migration during _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . as can be seen from the immunoblots in fig . the myc tagged version of with its caax box had the same apparent molecular _METHOD_ as a variant with an saax box when both were _PROTEIN_ in e. coli . however when the two were _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis the migration of the caax version was noticeably faster . similarly plants _PROTEIN_ either _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ contained a faster migrating form relative to plants _PROTEIN_ the saax mutant counterparts a size difference that was clearly evident by mixing the extracts prior to electrophoresis . for arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ the cysteine rich c terminus raised the possibility that this isoform is acylated and not prenylated . in support we found that recombinant could be modified with palmitic acid when incubated with palmitoyl coenzyme a in vitro . this acylation was sensitive to the palmitoylation inhibitor bromopalmitate when added simultaneously to the reaction . because acyl addition can _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mobility of the target protein we tested for this retardation by comparing the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mobility of _PROTEIN_ in e. coli versus arabidopsis . as can be seen in fig . a myc tagged version of had a significantly higher apparent molecular _METHOD_ when _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis relative to its recombinant counterpart indicating that is modified in planta possibly by acylation . arabidopsis mub proteins associate with _LOCATION_ addition of prenyl or long chain acyl groups often serves to anchor the modified proteins to _LOCATION_ . to provide support for this intracellular location we examined the _LOCATION_ and soluble distribution of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ or . the source of the crude cell lysates was either wild type seedlings or transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ myc or _METHOD_ tagged versions using the comparable saax mutants for and as nonprenylated controls . plants were homogenized under conditions that help preserve the integrity of the various cell compartments separated into the soluble and _LOCATION_ bound fractions by ultracentrifugation and the fractions were then assayed for the presence of mub proteins by immunoblot analysis . for wild type plants the mub proteins were detected with antibodies generated against arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ . these antibodies recognize well and show weak cross reactivity with and but poorly recognize the other three _METHOD_ . under our extraction conditions free _METHOD_ was present entirely in the soluble fraction which is consistent with its typical diffuse distribution within the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ when _PROTEIN_ in plants . in contrast nearly all of the signal for the mub proteins in wild type plants or plants _PROTEIN_ myc _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ was recovered in the _LOCATION_ enriched fraction . for and this distribution was dependent on the caax sequence as the comparable saax mutant proteins were found exclusively in the soluble fraction . in agreement with a possible modification by acylation _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was almost entirely _LOCATION_ associated as well . in an attempt to block the modification and subsequent _LOCATION_ association of we _PROTEIN_ a cysteine to serine mutant at position one of the four c terminal cysteines that could theoretically be acceptor sites for thioester acylation . however the _LOCATION_ association of this mutant was identical to the wild type indicating that this residue is not essential for its _LOCATION_ affinity . insertion of the prenyl group into the lipid bilayer confers a tight association of the protein with _LOCATION_ often requiring detergents for effective solubilization . to confirm this tight binding we tested several conditions known to dissociate either loosely bound _PROTEIN_ or integral _LOCATION_ proteins . here the _LOCATION_ enriched fraction from plants _PROTEIN_ myc was either resuspended in buffer nacl sodium _PROTEIN_ or triton x incubated for h and then recentrifuged to collect the _LOCATION_ fraction . although buffer and nacl were ineffective and sodium _PROTEIN_ only partially effective complete solubilization of myc and wild type was possible with triton x consistent with a tight association of with _LOCATION_ . mub proteins are localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in the observations that _METHOD_ is _LOCATION_ bound in arabidopsis like its nonderivatized counterpart we used similarly tagged versions to help define the intracellular location of the entire arabidopsis family by confocal _METHOD_ microscopy . in most cases both stably transformed intact plants and transfected protoplasts were analyzed which gave identical results . for each atmub the distribution of the wild type version was compared with either saax mutants for _METHOD_ or a collection of c terminal cys mutants for _METHOD_ to reveal whether prenylation or acylation of these cysteines were required for normal protein targeting . from the analysis of roots of stably transformed lines we found that free _METHOD_ was present in the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ consistent with previous reports of _METHOD_ localization . in contrast roots _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fused to each of the atmub sequences displayed little cytoplasmic or _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ with most of the signal concentrated at the periphery of the cell a distribution suggestive of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ binding . consistent with the saax mutants preventing both prenylation in vitro and the association of and with the _LOCATION_ fraction the saax mutants for _METHOD_ and were detected in the _LOCATION_ and throughout the cytoplasm a distribution similar to that of free _METHOD_ . similar results were also obtained with _METHOD_ the caax versions were _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized whereas the saax versions had soluble distributions . conversely the mutant for _METHOD_ remained localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in agreement with the retention of this mutant in the _LOCATION_ fraction . to demonstrate that the _METHOD_ atmubs were specifically associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and not the cell wall we exposed root cells of _METHOD_ seedlings to high osmotic conditions in an attempt to separate the two structures by plasmolysis . during this process we could clearly see the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ moving away from the wall in the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants and remaining with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ indicating that this _LOCATION_ is the _PROTEIN_ target . in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ strands could be detected during plasmolysis that likely represented adhesion points of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to the plasmodesmatal connections between cells . in contrast both free _METHOD_ and the saax version of remained in the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ compartments during plasmoloysis with no indications of a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ location . to further confirm a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ location we transiently co _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker h _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tagged with _METHOD_ in protoplasts and then visualized both markers simultaneously by confocal _METHOD_ microscopy . chlorophyll _METHOD_ was also captured as an indirect marker for pockets of cytoplasm . as can be seen in fig . both wild type _METHOD_ atmub reporters were localized to the periphery of the cell a pattern that was coincident with the _METHOD_ h _PROTEIN_ and clearly distinct from chlorophyll _METHOD_ . this pattern for _METHOD_ changed dramatically to a cytoplasmic and _LOCATION_ distribution when the corresponding saax mutant was used . acylated proteins typically use one or more c terminal cysteines as acceptor sites for thioester addition of the acyl moiety . to test whether the four terminal cysteines in are required for subcellular targeting we converted all four in the _METHOD_ reporter to serines and examined the location of the mutant protein by transient _PROTEIN_ . as shown in fig . this s mutant acquired a cytoplasmic/nuclear distribution . to identify which of the four cysteines are important for targeting we then tested the four residues individually . whereas the and mutants remained bound to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ like wild type the and mutants were _PROTEIN_ in the cytoplasm/nucleus indicating that these two more c terminal cysteines are essential for _LOCATION_ association presumably via acylation . mevinolin inhibits the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ association of arabidopsis further support for the prenylation of and in vivo we examined the effect of the _PROTEIN_ coa reductase inhibitor mevinolin on the distribution of _METHOD_ and in arabidopsis protoplasts . by inhibiting _PROTEIN_ coa reductase mevinolin blocks the accumulation of the five _PROTEIN_ precursor mevalonic acid which is used to generate long chain prenyl moieties by successive condensation reactions . prior studies confirmed that mevinolin is effective in plant suspension cultures and will reduce the availability of farnesyl and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate in vivo . following transfection the protoplasts were treated for or h with the drug before microscopic analysis . as can be seen in fig . nearly all protoplasts transfected with _METHOD_ in the absence of mevinolin displayed a _METHOD_ pattern that was exclusively associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . only a small percent showed _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ with the remaining protoplasts still exhibiting a strong _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ labeling along with weaker pockets of _METHOD_ cytoplasm . however after exposure to mevinolin a substantial relocalization of _METHOD_ was seen with a majority of the protoplasts now displaying strong _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ and only a few retaining _METHOD_ solely on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in contrast the near exclusive _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ distribution of _METHOD_ was unaffected by the presence of mevinolin with almost all of the transfected protoplasts showing strong _METHOD_ at this _LOCATION_ even after h of incubation with the drug . in addition to indicating that the change in _METHOD_ distribution induced by mevinolin was not the result of general toxicity the data for further support the notion that this isoform is _LOCATION_ anchored by a mechanism other than prenylation . mub localization is disrupted in prenylation defective arabidopsis further confirm that prenyl addition anchors mubs to _LOCATION_ we examined the _LOCATION_ association of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ in several previously described prenyltransferase mutants . the plp mutant lacks the common subunit of prenyltransferases whereas the _LOCATION_ and ggb mutants are defective in the subunits specific for either the pft or pggt i activities respectively . whole seedling extracts from the mutants along with their comparable wild types _LOCATION_ were separated into the soluble and _LOCATION_ fractions as above and analyzed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and immunoblotting with anti antibodies . similar to wild type col nearly all of was _LOCATION_ bound in the wild type ler background . however as would be expected for a prenylated protein most of was in the soluble fraction in the plp mutant . fig . showed that is preferentially modified with farnesyl and not geranylgeranyl moieties at least in vitro . consistent with this preference we found that most of the pool remained _LOCATION_ associated in extracts prepared from ggb plants but the majority of was in the soluble fraction of extracts from _LOCATION_ plants . unlike the distribution seen with the saax mutant a small amount of remained _LOCATION_ bound in the _LOCATION_ and plp mutants . this residual pool could represent the addition of a geranylgeranyl moiety to in the absence of pft activity or the modification of with other _LOCATION_ anchors . as further evidence for in vivo prenylation of atmubs we examined the localization of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ in protoplasts derived from wild type and _LOCATION_ and ggb mutants . as seen in fig . c and d the majority of _METHOD_ signal was localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of cells in wild type and ggb protoplasts but was found in _PROTEIN_ the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ of the pft deficient _LOCATION_ protoplasts in agreement with our in vitro assays and the _LOCATION_ association of in prenylation deficient mutants . conversely the bulk of the _METHOD_ signal was confined to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of wild type and _LOCATION_ protoplasts but was _PROTEIN_ cytoplasmic and _LOCATION_ localized in pggt i deficient ggb protoplasts . both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in the majority of wild type col and ler protoplasts .
