the phytohormone abscisic acid is critical to plant development and stress responses . abiotic stress triggers an aba signal transduction cascade which is comprised of the core components _PROTEIN_ aba receptors _PROTEIN_ type protein phosphatases and protein kinases . small _PROTEIN_ of the rop/rac family act as negative regulators of aba signal transduction . however the _METHOD_ by which aba controls the behavior of rop/racs have remained unclear . here we show that an arabidopsis guanine nucleotide exchange _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ is rapidly sequestered to intracellular particles in response to aba . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is sequestered via the endosome prevacuolar compartment pathway and is degraded . _PROTEIN_ directly interacts with several clade a _PROTEIN_ protein phosphatases including _PROTEIN_ . interestingly _PROTEIN_ undergoes constitutive degradation in quadruple _PROTEIN_ mutant plants revealing that active _PROTEIN_ protein phosphatases protect and stabilize _PROTEIN_ from aba mediated degradation . interestingly aba mediated degradation of _PROTEIN_ also plays an important role in aba mediated inhibition of _PROTEIN_ root growth . the presented findings point to a _PROTEIN_ ropgef rop/rac control loop model that is proposed to aid in shutting off aba signal transduction to counteract leaky aba signal transduction caused by monomeric _PROTEIN_ aba receptors in the absence of stress and facilitate signaling in response to aba .
to study the effects of aba signal transduction on _PROTEIN_ protein we first investigated the subcellular localization of in the absence and presence of exogenous aba . we _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and mcherry fusion proteins in nicotiana benthamiana epidermal cells . all three constructs showed similar _METHOD_ signal patterns . we then generated _METHOD_ overexpression lines in arabidopsis wild type plants . these transgenic lines exhibited swollen root hairs similar to those found upon overexpression of only or overexpression of a constitutively active _PROTEIN_ a downstream substrate of . these observations indicated that the _METHOD_ construct is functional in arabidopsis plants . confocal microscopy revealed that in the absence of exogenous aba the _METHOD_ signal was largely located in the _LOCATION_ and cell periphery where mcherry _METHOD_ signal was visible following nacl induced plasmolysis and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ partially overlapped with the lipophilic dye signal which stains the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . surprisingly after application of aba numerous intracellular _METHOD_ particles appeared in arabidopsis root epidermal cells . further analyses showed that formation of these particles was time and aba dose dependent . experiments investigating different hormone stimuli including auxin ga ethylene ja and brassinosteroid demonstrated that this effect was specific to aba relative to these hormones . subcellular localization of _METHOD_ in epidermal cells of the root elongation zone of arabidopsis without aba treatment or treated with aba for min . time lapse confocal images of a representative arabidopsis root epidermal cell _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in day old seedlings exposed to aba . right _METHOD_ and bright field merged image indicates that min of

illustrating the observed changes in _METHOD_ . control time lapse confocal images of a representative n. benthamiana leaf epidermal cell _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ only exposed to aba . confocal images were captured and are shown with the same parameters for each panel within b d and e. results are representative confocal images from n separate experiments and > independent cell images were captured per experiment . scale bars . to better visualize this aba mediated formation of intracellular particles we examined the subcellular localization of _METHOD_ in n. benthamiana leaves treated with aba . time course confocal microscopy revealed that within min of aba treatment _METHOD_ moved from the cell periphery and gradually accumulated in numerous particles . subsequently the _METHOD_ intensity was substantially reduced over a time period of min . in comparison the subcellular localization and _METHOD_ signal intensity of _METHOD_ alone was not altered under the same aba treatment . furthermore _METHOD_ driven by the promoter also formed particles in response to aba . in controls without aba addition h of microscopy did not cause _METHOD_ to form particles . experiments were carried out to determine the identity of the aba induced _METHOD_ particles . we investigated the co localization of _METHOD_ in n. benthamiana leaves with mcherry labeled organelle markers . no co localization or sparse overlap was observed with mitochondrial peroxisomal _LOCATION_ and cis _LOCATION_ markers indicating that _METHOD_ proteins were not sequestered into these endomembrane _METHOD_ in response to aba . in comparison overlap of the _METHOD_ and mcherry signals was observed in co localization analysis with the retromer marker _PROTEIN_ and the prevacuolar compartment markers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . co localization assays of _METHOD_ with the indicated organelle markers in n. benthamiana leaf epidermal cells in response to aba . _METHOD_ was co _PROTEIN_ with mcherry labeled organelle markers in n. benthamiana leaf epidermal cells . n. benthamiana leaves were treated with aba for h before confocal imaging . co localization is visible as yellow dots in the merged images . organelle marker names are listed in parentheses on the left . pvc pre _LOCATION_ compartment . representative images are shown of three independent co localization experiments . . yellow boxes indicate approximate regions amplified to the right of merged images . levels of co localization for yellow boxed regions are depicted in relative intensity scatter plots . values of the linear pearson correlation coefficient and the non linear spearman s rank correlation coefficient were calculated and are given in the upper left corner of scatter plots . confocal images of the subcellular localization of _METHOD_ in response to the indicated treatments . day old arabidopsis seedlings overexpressing _METHOD_ incubated with aba only aba plus wortmannin _PROTEIN_ or aba plus _METHOD_ for

treatment . scale bars . reminiscent of recent studies showing that the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the brassinosteroid receptor _PROTEIN_ and the auxin efflux carrier _PROTEIN_ are internalized rapidly from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and sequentially delivered into the _LOCATION_ via the _PROTEIN_ endosome we speculated that _METHOD_ proteins were also subjected to this process in response to aba . in line with this hypothesis aba induced _METHOD_ particle formation was sensitive to wortmannin a phosphatidylphosphate kinase _PROTEIN_ inhibitor that interferes with vesicle trafficking from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to the prevacuolar compartment . _METHOD_ particles accumulated into typical wortmannin induced intracellular _PROTEIN_ like structures . in addition we observed that aba induced _METHOD_ particles partially co localized with an endosomal _PROTEIN_ marker _PROTEIN_ . in response to stimulation by a combination of aba and brefeldin a an inhibitor of endosomal transport _METHOD_ particles aggregated into large blocks known as bfa bodies . furthermore subcellular localization of _METHOD_ did not showed significant change in response to wortmannin or bfa treatment respectively . the above analysis suggested that _METHOD_ proteins are relocated to the prevacuolar compartment via an endosome prevacuolar compartment pathway in response to aba . proteins in the prevacuolar compartment are further transported into _LOCATION_ through _LOCATION_ fusion and are subsequently subjected to either storage or degradation . to trace the fate of _METHOD_ we carried out western blot analyses to detect _METHOD_ fusion protein abundance in response to aba in transgenic arabidopsis plants . immunoblot analyses revealed that _METHOD_ protein levels were rapidly and substantially reduced in response to aba treatment but only slightly altered in response to the control ethanol stimulus and combined aba and wortmannin . moreover aba mediated degradation of _METHOD_ was still evident in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor suggesting no major role of the proteasome in this degradation response . furthermore confocal microscopic observations indicated that aba mediated _METHOD_ particles showed co localization with the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ . taken together we concluded that _METHOD_ is sequestered to _LOCATION_ and is degraded in response to aba . western blot analyses of _METHOD_ protein levels in response to the indicated treatments . ten day old pubq _METHOD_ arabidopsis seedlings were immersed in _METHOD_ liquid medium for h then transferred into _METHOD_ medium supplemented with aba or aba plus wortmannin and etoh for the indicated durations . for treatment seedlings were immersed in _METHOD_ medium with for h then transferred in _METHOD_ medium with aba plus for the indicated durations . total protein extracts were subjected to immunoblot analysis with _METHOD_ antibody . _METHOD_ blue staining of _PROTEIN_ polyacrylamide gel _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was used as a loading control . we pursued yeast two hybrid experiments with as bait in search of key aba signal transduction _PROTEIN_ that might participate in aba mediated degradation of . the type protein phosphatase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was identified as a candidate interactor . interaction between _PROTEIN_ and was observed in assays . known interactions between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ or and _PROTEIN_ served as positive controls . in comparison with _PROTEIN_ other _PROTEIN_ including _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ exhibited weak interactions with . however no reproducible interactions were observed for and _PROTEIN_ which is a direct substrate of _PROTEIN_ . lack of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interactions in the absence of aba was used as a negative control . yeast two hybrid assay of interactions of with the indicated _PROTEIN_ . the indicated construct combinations were co transformed into the yeast strain . transformants were grown on l w control plates for d and l w h selective plates with mm amino triazole _PROTEIN_ for d. the interactions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were used as positive controls and _PROTEIN_ without aba as negative control . in vitro binding assay of and _PROTEIN_ . each input protein was incubated with glutathione sepharose beads containing _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ control protein followed by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ affinity purification and subsequent immunoblotting with anti strep ii antibody . bait _METHOD_ brilliant blue staining of purified bait protein _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ pull down western blot of pull down with gluothathione sepharose and probed with anti strep ii antibody input _METHOD_ brilliant blue staining of recombinant input proteins strepii _PROTEIN_ strepii _PROTEIN_ and strepii _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ binding were used as positive and negative controls respectively . the putative interaction of _PROTEIN_ and was further investigated in in vitro pull down assays . using _PROTEIN_ tagged as bait strep ii tagged _PROTEIN_ and also _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ co immunoprecipitated with _PROTEIN_ . next we pursued bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation assays to investigate putative interactions between and _PROTEIN_ in plant cells . surprisingly numerous _METHOD_ particles were detected in the _LOCATION_ . quantitative analyses of bifc signals showed strong _PROTEIN_ interactions and weak signals for interaction with other clade a _PROTEIN_ which correlated with observations from experiments . in positive controls strong bifc signals for _PROTEIN_ and interaction were observed which appeared at the cell periphery . co localization analyses with _METHOD_ and mcherry _PROTEIN_ indicated that and _PROTEIN_ localizations overlapped at the cell periphery without aba treatment . furthermore and co ip experiments showed that also interacted with additional _PROTEIN_ in the clade a _PROTEIN_ phosphatase family including _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . we performed experiments to determine whether _PROTEIN_ are involved in regulating the formation of intracellular _METHOD_ particles . we _PROTEIN_ the same pubq _METHOD_ construct as used in wild type arabidopsis plants for subcellular localization analyses in the quadruple mutant background _PROTEIN_ and investigated the subcellular localization of _METHOD_ . over transgenic lines were checked and all transgenic lines showed extremely weak _METHOD_ signals compared with those in the wild type background . rt pcr and quantitative rt pcr analyses showed that this is not because of a reduced transcript level of the mrna . interestingly subcellular localization analyses of _METHOD_ showed _METHOD_ in intracellular particles of _PROTEIN_ root cells even without aba treatment . subcellular localization of _METHOD_ in root epidermal cells of wild type and _PROTEIN_ background in the absence of exogenous aba . confocal images were acquired and are shown with the same parameters except master gain _PROTEIN_ . scale bars . the depicted imaging experiments were repeated at least three times . rt pcr analyses of transcripts in wild type plants and _METHOD_ overexpression lines in wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant background . rt pcr for transcripts was used as loading control . western blot analyses of _METHOD_ protein levels with anti _METHOD_ antibody in wild type plants and _METHOD_ overexpression lines in wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant background . _METHOD_ blue stain of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gel was used as a loading control . _PROTEIN_ rubisco large subunit . roots of day old seedlings grown on half _METHOD_ medium were collected to extract total rna and protein . to investigate the identity of these particles transgenic _METHOD_ seedlings were subjected to wortmannin treatment . confocal microscopic observations indicated that these particles partially aggregated into _PROTEIN_ like structures h after wortmannin treatment . after prolonged wortmannin exposure of _METHOD_ plants _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signals appeared in the cell periphery and perinuclear region . this cellular localization pattern resembled that of subcellular localization _METHOD_ in the wild type background in the absence of aba . these confocal microscopic analyses strongly suggested that _METHOD_ protein in _PROTEIN_ plants underwent constitutive degradation in the absence of added aba . these findings suggested that the wild type _PROTEIN_ prohibit spontaneous degradation of _METHOD_ . furthermore in newly emerging _PROTEIN_ roots the intracellular particles were not degraded and instead aggregated into large intracellular _METHOD_ bodies . these observations are consistent with the lack of the _PROTEIN_ of the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ markers in these developing new arabidopsis root tip cells that have been proposed to lack lytic _LOCATION_ at this developmental stage . we next investigated _METHOD_ protein levels in _METHOD_ plants by western blotting . although mrna levels were abundant in _METHOD_ plants we could not detect a clear western blot signal indicating the _METHOD_ protein levels are extremely low in the _PROTEIN_ quadruple mutant in contrast to wild type plants . additional western blot experiments showed that _METHOD_ protein levels were measurably enhanced after h of wortmannin treatment . taken together these data show that _PROTEIN_ protein phosphatases interact with and in wild type plants prevent _METHOD_ degradation in the absence of aba . previously the small _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in its active form was shown to directly bind to _PROTEIN_ and protect _PROTEIN_ protein phosphatase activity from inhibition by the aba receptor _PROTEIN_ . given that gefs activate rops through facilitating gdp/gtp exchange we speculated that plays a positive role in _PROTEIN_ function . to dissect the genetic relevance between and the _PROTEIN_ protein phosphatases we analyzed aba mediated phenotypes in _METHOD_ overexpression plants . we first examined aba mediated inhibition of seed germination and seedling establishment . after d of stratification _PROTEIN_ mutant seeds showed a _PROTEIN_ germination phenotype on _METHOD_ medium _PROTEIN_ of the presence of aba . in comparison three independent _METHOD_ transgenic lines showed partial but not full restoration of seed germination and seedling establishment in the quadruple mutant background which may be linked to the interaction of with additional clade a _PROTEIN_ . the percentage of seeds that germinated on _METHOD_ media or supplemented with aba . approximately seeds of each genotype were sown and scored for radical emergence after d of stratification . represents three independent transgenic _METHOD_

lacking or supplemented with aba . seeds of each genotype were stratified for d for synchronous germination . red bars indicate approximate root lengths . scale bars cm . quantification of aba mediated root growth inhibition . twenty day old seedlings grown on _METHOD_ medium with similar primary root length were transferred onto _METHOD_ medium lacking or supplemented with aba . after d of growth images were taken and primary root length was measured with image j software . _LOCATION_ bars represent sd . we then analyzed the responses of these genotypes in aba mediated inhibition of primary root elongation . to ensure simultaneous seed germination seeds of all genotypes were stratified for d. seedlings with similar root lengths were transferred onto _METHOD_ plates supplemented with or without aba . the results indicated that _METHOD_ seedlings were less sensitive to aba mediated inhibition of primary root growth than the quadruple mutant . these phenotypic assays provide initial evidence for a genetic interaction between and _PROTEIN_ in aba responses . to pursue a more direct genetic investigation of functions in aba signaling we examined aba related phenotypes in single knockout mutant and overexpression lines . however we did not observe any differential responses to aba mediated inhibition of seed germination and primary root growth in these two genotypes compared with wild type . we speculated that this result was attributable to possible overlapping gene functions considering the high sequence homology among members of the large gef family . to circumvent possible redundancy we pursued a generation of higher order gef mutants . considering the rapid degradation in response to aba we assumed that other gefs with similar functions as in aba signal transduction should be removed in the same manner in response to aba . based on this hypothesis we examined the subcellular localization of all members of the gef family in the absence and presence of aba . the results showed that like _PROTEIN_ and formed particles in response to aba . other gefs did not show aba induced intracellular particle formation . by analyzing aba mediated phenotypes in higher order gef mutants we found that a triple mutant showed a slightly enhanced sensitivity to aba mediated inhibition of primary root elongation and seed germination compared to wild type consistent with a previous report . this slight hypersensitivity to aba mediated inhibition of seed germination was further enhanced in quadruple mutant seed . the above analyses provided evidence to support that gefs act as negative regulators of aba responses . the percentage of seeds that germinated on _METHOD_ medium lacking or supplemented with aba . approximately seeds of wild type t dna insertion single mutant and _METHOD_ overexpression transgenic lines were sown and scored for radical emergence for a time period of d. quantification of aba mediated inhibition of primary

seeds . during exploration of the biological significance of aba mediated degradation of the protein we noticed that _PROTEIN_ mutant plants showed a strong reduction in _PROTEIN_ root growth on _METHOD_ medium . the _PROTEIN_ root growth deficiency was also observed on _METHOD_ medium supplemented with aba iaa or both _PROTEIN_ . interestingly overexpression of _METHOD_ partially rescued _PROTEIN_ root length and visible _PROTEIN_ root number defects of _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . quantification of average _PROTEIN_ root length in wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and pubq _METHOD_ overexpression plants . twenty day old seedlings grown on _METHOD_ medium with similar primary root lengths were transferred onto _METHOD_ medium or _METHOD_ medium supplemented with iaa aba or iaa plus aba _PROTEIN_ . after the indicated times of growth on hormone containing or control media _PROTEIN_ roots were scanned and measured . note that the bar graphs are from different time points to accurately resolve _PROTEIN_ root lengths for each condition . _LOCATION_ bars represent standard deviation . representative image showing _PROTEIN_ root growth of different seedling genotypes grown

aba added . working model for _PROTEIN_ ropgef rop control loop in regulating aba signal transduction . arrows indicate activation and bars indicate repression . details are described in the text . given the reduction of _PROTEIN_ root length together with the low protein abundance in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants we hypothesized that together with other gefs might have the ability to promote _PROTEIN_ root growth . to examine this hypothesis we studied _PROTEIN_ root growth in wild type _PROTEIN_ aba receptor quadruple mutant and _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ overexpression lines . we found that both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ transgenic lines showed longer average _PROTEIN_ root lengths compared with those in the control wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant lines respectively . this result supported that has an ability to promote _PROTEIN_ root growth . interestingly in the presence of aba in wild type the longer _PROTEIN_ root phenotype in _METHOD_ plants was repressed . in comparison _PROTEIN_ root length in _METHOD_ was longer than those in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants in the presence of aba . these data are consistent with a model in which aba contributes to regulation of _PROTEIN_ mediated _PROTEIN_ root growth . furthermore we also examined _PROTEIN_ root growth in several higher order gef mutants . _PROTEIN_ root growth deficiency was not significant in the absence of aba but was observed in the quadruple mutant plants compared with wild type plants in the presence of aba .

primary root length . because different hormones have different effects on _PROTEIN_ root growth it is difficult to compare the effect of different hormone treatments at the same time . for example in the present study _PROTEIN_ roots were too dense to be distinguished on auxin or auxin plus aba medium plates when _PROTEIN_ roots were imaged > d after transfer of seedlings and the visible _PROTEIN_ roots on _METHOD_ medium have just emerged . therefore plates were scanned and _PROTEIN_ roots were measured at the indicated times when _PROTEIN_ root lengths could be accurately measured . comparisons were made among genotypes within each group with identical hormone treatments . all relevant data are within the paper and its supporting information files .
