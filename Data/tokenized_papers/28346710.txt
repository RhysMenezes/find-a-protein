thiamin diphosphate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is an essential coenzyme present in all _METHOD_ . animals obtain _PROTEIN_ from their diets but plants synthesize _PROTEIN_ novo . we isolated and characterized an arabidopsis pale mutant that contained higher concentrations of thiamin monophosphate and less thiamin and _PROTEIN_ than the wild type . supplementation with thiamin but not the thiazole and pyrimidine precursors rescued the mutant phenotype indicating that the mutant is a thiamin deficient mutant . map based cloning and whole genome sequencing revealed that the mutant has a mutation in _GENE_ encoding a tmp phosphatase of the _PROTEIN_ biosynthesis pathway . we further confirmed that the mutation of _GENE_ is responsible for the mutant phenotypes by complementing the mutant with constructs overexpressing full length _GENE_ . most plant _PROTEIN_ biosynthetic enzymes are located in the chloroplasts and _LOCATION_ but _GENE_ _METHOD_ localized to the _LOCATION_ of the root hypocotyl mesophyll and guard cells of the _GENE_ _METHOD_ complemented plants . the subcellular localization of a functional tmp phosphatase suggests that the complete vitamin _PROTEIN_ biosynthesis pathway may involve the chloroplasts mitochondria and _LOCATION_ in plants . analysis of _PROTEIN_ promoter uida activity revealed that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in vascular tissues of arabidopsis seedlings . quantitative rt pcr analysis of _PROTEIN_ biosynthesis genes and genes encoding the _PROTEIN_ dependent enzymes pyruvate dehydrogenase ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and transketolase revealed that the transcript levels of these genes were upregulated in the mutant . these results suggest that endogenous levels of _PROTEIN_ may affect the _PROTEIN_ of genes involved in _PROTEIN_ biosynthesis and _PROTEIN_ dependent enzymes .
we previously isolated a collection of albino and pale green mutants to study the effects of _LOCATION_ genes on chloroplast development and function in arabidopsis . one of the mutants has pale green cotyledons and leaves when grown on tissue culture medium . in the mutant cotyledons some regions in the distal part are green and the basal areas are pale . the true leaves of the mutant seedlings are either pale variegated or bear a pattern similar to that of the cotyledons . analysis of the photosynthetic pigments revealed that the contents of chlorophylls a and b and carotenoid pigments in the mutant are approximately less than those of the wild type . similarly the photosynthesis activity of the mutant as indicated by the maximum quantum yield of photosystem ii is also about that of the wild type . the pale green phenotype of the mutant implies that chloroplasts in the mutant may be defective . to study the effects of the mutation on chloroplast development we used transmission electron microscopy to examine leaf sections of arabidopsis wild type and mutant plants . the chloroplasts from the green region of the mutant leaves were normal . by contrast the chloroplasts from the pale green region of the mutant leaves contained large vesicles with very few _LOCATION_ or had overly stacked and disconnected _LOCATION_ . the abnormal _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in the mutant may still contain functional photosynthetic pigments . together with the normal chloroplasts in the green region of the mutant leaves these mutant chloroplasts may be responsible for the approximately reduction in photosynthetic activity compared with the wild type . when grown in soil the mutant was significantly smaller than the wild type and the chlorotic tissues were _PROTEIN_ located around the leaf veins . analysis of the maximum quantum yield of psii in the mutant revealed that older leaves had a lower photosynthetic activity than the younger leaves . we frequently observed that the chlorotic phenotype of the mutant was less severe when grown in soil than when grown in tissue culture . the composition of nutrients in tissue culture media is very different from that in soil . thus we aimed to identify the major components in the tissue culture medium that enhanced the chlorotic phenotype of the mutant . _PROTEIN_ and nitrogen are two of the major nutrients used in tissue culture medium . we first examined the effects of sucrose on the mutant . when grown on medium containing half strength murashige and skoog salts _METHOD_ plus or sucrose the mutant seedlings all showed a severe bleaching phenotype . these results suggested that the concentrations of sucrose commonly used in tissue culture media did not have a significant effect on the chlorotic phenotype of the mutant . half strength _METHOD_ medium contains high concentrations of nitrate and ammonium . when grown on medium containing lower concentrations of nitrate and ammonium the mutant seedlings still had a severe pale green phenotype . thus we examined the effect of different nitrogen sources on the mutant phenotype . interestingly the mutant seedlings did not exhibit the chlorotic phenotypes and grew well on medium containing mm nitrate as the sole nitrogen source . arabidopsis seedlings are more sensitive to exogenous ammonium than to nitrate because high concentrations of ammonium are toxic to plants . the growth of the arabidopsis seedlings was severely inhibited and the degree of bleaching was comparable between the wild type and the mutant when grown on medium containing mm ammonium as the sole nitrogen source . however the mutant seedlings were slightly paler than the wild type seedlings when grown on medium containing or mm ammonium as the sole nitrogen source . these results suggested that ammonium at least partially affects the chlorotic phenotype of the mutant . we next examined the growth of the mutant on medium containing mm nitrate supplemented with or mm ammonium . the growth and leaf color were similar between the wild type and the mutant seedlings when grown on medium containing mm nitrate as the sole nitrogen source . however the combination of nitrate and ammonium not only significantly promoted the growth of arabidopsis seedlings but also enhanced the chlorotic phenotype of the mutant . we obtained similar results with arabidopsis seedlings grown vertically on tissue culture medium containing different nitrogen sources . although the mutant was originally isolated from t dna insertion lines genetic analysis indicated that the mutation was not caused by t dna . therefore we performed map based cloning to identify the _PROTEIN_ gene . a pcr analysis with simple sequence length polymorphism markers of mutant plants derived from the cross between the mutant and the landsberg _LOCATION_ ecotype revealed that the mutation is located near the sslp marker and the centromere of chromosome . we then sequenced the whole genome of the mutant and compared it with the reference genome focusing on the bottom arm of chromosome . a point mutation g to a was identified in the fifth exon of _GENE_ located between marker and the centromere of chromosome . _GENE_ encodes a protein containing a tena/thi domain and a had domain _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the mutation results in a premature stop codon at the residue which would potentially produce a truncated protein without a functional had domain . the had domain is usually associated with phosphatase activity . the had domain of _GENE_ was shown to be critical for tmp phosphatase activity . thus the mutation is a strong or null allele of _GENE_ as the encoded mutant protein may lack phosphatase activity . we used semi quantitative rt pcr analysis to examine the _PROTEIN_ of _GENE_ in the mutant and the wild type . steady state levels of _GENE_ transcripts were slightly lower in the mutant than in the wild type . we sequenced the rt pcr products derived from the wild type and the mutant and confirmed that the mutant transcript had a premature stop codon caused by a g to a substitution at the residue . we performed complementation assays to confirm that the mutation in _GENE_ is responsible for the mutant phenotypes . _PROTEIN_ vectors harboring _GENE_ and _GENE_ _METHOD_ were transformed into the mutant and the transgenic lines were carried to homozygosity . both constructs rescued the mutant phenotype . the complementation of the mutant by _GENE_ _METHOD_ also indicates that _GENE_ _METHOD_ is functional in arabidopsis . the tena/thi domain containing protein is usually associated with thiamin metabolism whereas the had domain is often linked to phosphatase activity . the presence of these domains in wild type _GENE_ suggests that _PROTEIN_ may be involved in thiamin metabolism . thus we tested if supplementation with thiamin related metabolites could complement the mutant phenotype . the addition of thiazole and pyrimidine precursors het hmp and het plus hmp failed to rescue the chlorotic phenotype of the mutant seedlings . however application of exogenous thiamin fully rescued the mutant phenotype . we tested different concentrations of thiamin and found that supplementation with as little as thiamin rescued the chlorotic phenotype of the mutant seedlings . exogenous thiamin is known to promote plant growth . thus we could not exclude the possibility that the complementation of the mutant by exogenous thiamin resulted from improved plant growth rather than from the recovery of _PROTEIN_ deficiency . to test if the complementation by thiamin was specific to the mutant we examined the effect of exogenous thiamin on the growth of three genetically different pale green mutants isolated in the laboratory . although the mutated genes causing the pale green phenotype of these three mutants have yet to be identified supplementation with thiamin failed to rescue the pale green phenotype of these mutants . these results suggested that is a new allele of the thiamin deficient mutant . taking into account the domain structure of _PROTEIN_ the thiamin deficient phenotype of the mutant and our current understanding of the vitamin _PROTEIN_ biosynthesis pathway we speculated that _PROTEIN_ is a tmp phosphatase . thus we analyzed the tmp thiamin and _PROTEIN_ contents in the mutant . the amount of tmp in the mutant was about four fold higher than in the wild type . by contrast the amounts of thiamin and _PROTEIN_ in the mutant were approximately of the wild type levels . therefore the mutant is somewhat deficient in thiamin and _PROTEIN_ which is consistent with the recent discovery that _GENE_ encodes a tmp phosphatase . the phenotype of the mutant suggested that _GENE_ may play a role in chloroplast development and function . however the targetp prediction indicated that _GENE_ contained a putative targeting peptide for mitochondrial localization . since we showed that _GENE_ _METHOD_ is functional in the mutant we used confocal microscopy to observe the subcellular localization of the fusion protein in the complemented plants . consistent with the prediction the _METHOD_ signals of _GENE_ _METHOD_ co localized with the _LOCATION_ specific _METHOD_ dye mitotracker orange in the root cells of the complemented plant . _GENE_ _METHOD_ was also localized to _LOCATION_ like structures in hypocotyl cells and leaf guard cells but not to the chloroplasts or _LOCATION_ . we further isolated mesophyll protoplasts from _GENE_ _METHOD_ complemented mutant plants . the isolated protoplasts were stained with mitotracker orange and observed under a confocal microscope . the green _METHOD_ signals of _GENE_ _METHOD_ co localized exclusively with the _METHOD_ signals of mitotracker orange in the protoplast . we generated several independent _PROTEIN_ promoter uida transgenic lines in the wild type background to study the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . in day old seedlings the activity of _PROTEIN_ gus was detected in the major veins and tips of the cotyledons and the vascular tissues of the hypocotyl and roots . in and day old seedlings _PROTEIN_ gus was detected in the vascular tissues of the cotyledons leaves hypocotyls and roots and in the tip regions of emerging young leaves . a relatively high level of _PROTEIN_ gus activity was detected in the shoot apical region and the hypocotyl root junction of arabidopsis seedlings . close up images from a day old seedling showed _PROTEIN_ gus activity in the hypocotyl root junction vascular tissues of the primary root veins of the cotyledons and leaves and trichomes of the leaves . interestingly _PROTEIN_ gus was not detected in the _PROTEIN_ roots . in the primary root tip _PROTEIN_ gus was detected in the transition and elongation zones but not in the meristematic zone . during the reproductive stage _PROTEIN_ gus was detected inside flower buds and specifically in the sepals anthers filaments and styles of mature flowers . _PROTEIN_ gus was also detected in the pollen within the anther of a mature flower and in the pedicel of a mature silique . a reduction in endogenous _PROTEIN_ levels may affect the _PROTEIN_ of vitamin _PROTEIN_ biosynthesis genes in the mutant . we used quantitative rt pcr to examine the _PROTEIN_ of known vitamin _PROTEIN_ biosynthesis genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the wild type the mutant and the _GENE_ complementation line . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was slightly downregulated in the mutant which was consistent with the semi quantitative rt pcr result . interestingly the _PROTEIN_ of the other known vitamin _PROTEIN_ biosynthesis genes was upregulated in the mutant compared with that of the wild type and the complementation line . in addition to vitamin _PROTEIN_ biosynthesis genes we also examined the _PROTEIN_ of genes encoding _PROTEIN_ dependent enzymes . of the genes examined the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and was also upregulated in the mutant .
arabidopsis thaliana was used for the generation of mutant and transgenic lines . for plants grown on tissue culture medium arabidopsis seeds were surface sterilized by soaking in bleach with tween then rinsed three times with sterile water and planted on _METHOD_ plates containing ethanesulfonic acid sucrose ph and agar . the plate was sealed with parafilm kept at for days and then transferred to a growth chamber on a h h dark cycle at . for phenotypic analysis on different nitrogen sources plants were grown on medium containing _METHOD_ modified basal salt mixture without nitrogen supplemented with the indicated concentrations of nitrate and/or ammonium . for plants grown on soil week old seedlings grown on tissue culture plates were transferred to soil and placed in a growth chamber on a h h dark cycle at . the mutant was isolated from a collection of t dna insertion lines . genetic analysis of the mutant revealed that the mutation was not linked to a t dna insertion . thus we combined the approaches of map based cloning and whole genome sequencing to characterize the mutation . the mutant was crossed to ler to generate several progeny with a normal green phenotype . the mapping population was collected from plants displaying a pale green phenotype when grown on _METHOD_ medium containing sucrose . genomic dna isolated from individual pale green plants was used for pcr analysis with sslp markers . next generation sequencing technology was used to sequence the whole genome of the mutant as previously described . a maxi imaging _PROTEIN_ chlorophyll fluorometer was used to measure the maximum quantum yield of psii . chlorophyll _METHOD_ imaging and determination of photosynthetic pigments were performed as previously described . ten day old arabidopsis seedlings were homogenized with beads in ml of acetic acid incubated at with continuous shaking for min and centrifuged at g for min at . the supernatants were filtered with a hydrophilic polypropylene _LOCATION_ and submitted to the metabolomics core at academia sinica for analysis of thiamin vitamers using waters acquity ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled to a waters xevo triple quadrupole . the separation was performed by injecting of sample into an acquity uplc _PROTEIN_ column at a flow rate of using a min gradient for analysis . mobile phase a was with formic acid . mobile phase b was acetonitrile with fa . the separation gradient used was min b min from b to b min b min from b to b min b . characteristic _METHOD_ transitions were monitored using positive multiple reaction monitoring mode for thiamin tmp and _PROTEIN_ . data acquisition and processing were performed using _METHOD_ version and targetlynx software . the first leaves from week old wild type arabidopsis and mutant seedlings were used for transmission electron microscopy . sample fixation dehydration embedding sectioning staining and observation were performed as previously described . rna extraction and rt pcr analysis were performed as previously described . primers used for semi quantitative rt pcr analysis were as follows _GENE_ tctggtttcgcaccaagtc aaaaggctgccctgatgagg aagagataatccaggagattc caaggagagaacagcttgg . the primer sequences used for quantitative rt pcr analysis of vitamin _PROTEIN_ biosynthesis genes and genes encoding _PROTEIN_ dependent enzymes are listed in table . full length _GENE_ cdnas were produced by rt pcr with the forward primer caccatgcgcttcctcttcccc and two different reverse primers ttactcccatccaagagcga and ctcccatccaagagcgaatg in separate reactions . the _GENE_ cdnas with and without the stop codon were cloned into a gateway pentr/d topo vector . after sequence verification the cdna clones were separately recombined into destination vectors and to generate _GENE_ and _GENE_ _METHOD_ constructs . the resulting plasmids were transformed into agrobacterium tumefaciens which was then transformed into the mutant plants by the floral dip mthod . the harvested seeds were planted on medium containing hygromycin to select for successful transformants . during the selection hygromycin resistant plants were green indicating that _GENE_ and _GENE_ _METHOD_ cdnas complemented the mutant . multiple independent lines from both transformation events were carried to homozygosity for further analysis . seedlings from several independent _GENE_ _METHOD_ complementation lines were observed under a meta zeiss confocal laser scanning microscope . the _METHOD_ dye mitotracker orange was used to stain the mitochondria . mitotracker orange stained protoplasts isolated from the leaves of the same complementation lines were also observed by confocal microscopy . a putative promoter region encompassing bp upstream of the initiation of the translation start codon of _PROTEIN_ was obtained by pcr with primers cacctgacatagatagttaaactg and _PROTEIN_ using arabidopsis genomic dna as a template . the pcr product was cloned into a gateway pentr/d topo vector . after sequence verification the entire bp dna fragment was recombined into the gateway destination vector to generate a _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ uida fusion construct . the _PROTEIN_ uida construct was transformed into a. tumefaciens strain which was then transformed into wild type arabidopsis plants by the floral dip method . several _PROTEIN_ uida transgenic lines were carried to homozygosity for the gus assay as previously described . similar gus staining results were obtained in three independent lines .
