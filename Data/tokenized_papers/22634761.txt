the arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ mutant which is defective in a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme displays inorganic phosphate toxicity as a result of enhanced uptake and root to shoot translocation of pi . to elucidate downstream components of the _PROTEIN_ dependent regulatory pathway we identified two _PROTEIN_ suppressors as carrying missense mutations in _PROTEIN_ which has been implicated in pi loading to the xylem . in support of the genetic interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we found that the protein level of _PROTEIN_ is increased in _PROTEIN_ whereas such accumulation is ameliorated in both _PROTEIN_ suppressors . results from cycloheximide and endosomal cys protease inhibitor e treatments further suggest that _PROTEIN_ degradation is _PROTEIN_ dependent and involves multivesicular body mediated _LOCATION_ proteolysis . using the transient _PROTEIN_ system of tobacco leaves we demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are partially colocalized and physically interact in the endomembranes where the ubiquitin conjugase activity of _PROTEIN_ is required for _PROTEIN_ degradation . in addition reduced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ caused by _PROTEIN_ mutations impede pi uptake indicating a functional association between xylem loading and acquisition of pi . together our findings uncover a pivotal molecular mechanism by which _PROTEIN_ modulates the degradation of _PROTEIN_ in the endomembranes to _PROTEIN_ pi homeostasis in plants .
the genetic screening for the _PROTEIN_ suppressor was performed using ethyl methanesulfonate induced mutagenesis . from the population of plants grown in fertilized soils mixed with mm we identified two suppressors and which did not display the pi toxicity phenotype of _PROTEIN_ but showed improved growth . by measuring the shoot pi concentration of and plants and verifying that the _PROTEIN_ point mutation remained in the mutants we confirmed that both are indeed _PROTEIN_ suppressors . compared with _PROTEIN_ grown under pi sufficient conditions and seedlings had lower shoot pi concentrations yet higher root pi concentrations . in addition while _PROTEIN_ exhibited a higher shoot to root ratio of total pi distribution than the wild type controls under pi conditions the tendency was ameliorated in and . notably when was grown hydroponically to an adult stage under pi conditions the shoot pi concentration of was nearly as low as that of the wild type under pi conditions . however did not show the characteristic _METHOD_ of shoot pi deficiency such as anthocyanin accumulation . by contrast the adult grown hydroponically under pi conditions was slightly smaller than the wild type and had an intermediate shoot pi concentration between that of _PROTEIN_ and the wild type . as the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant has been shown to display the _PROTEIN_ like phenotype _PROTEIN_ was suggested to be epistatic to _PROTEIN_ . it is tempting to suspect that disruption of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant may disrupt an inevitable step of pi accumulation the root to shoot translocation of pi thereby rendering the phenotype of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ similar to that of _PROTEIN_ . considering that mutations in _PROTEIN_ may hamper pi accumulation in the shoot of _PROTEIN_ through a similar mechanism as assumed in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ we then sequenced the coding sequence of _PROTEIN_ in and before proceeding with the map based cloning . intriguingly the point mutations _PROTEIN_ and of _PROTEIN_ were identified in and respectively . both mutations reside in the spx domain of _PROTEIN_ causing substitution of two amino acid residues conserved among the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ family glu for lys at position in and ala for thr at position in . to determine the genetic inheritance of we backcrossed to _PROTEIN_ . by examining the distribution and range of shoot pi concentrations among the progeny we ensured that the _PROTEIN_ suppressor phenotype was segregated in the population as a single locus . interestingly we found that one peak representing the like population within the range of wild type controls was followed by two close _PROTEIN_ like peaks indicating that is not a simple recessive mutation . next we introduced the genomic fragment encompassing the _PROTEIN_ coding region spanning from bp upstream of the start codon to bp downstream of the stop codon to complement and . because the exogenous _PROTEIN_ of wild type _PROTEIN_ restored the capacity of both _PROTEIN_ suppressors to accumulate more pi in the shoot we inferred that the missense mutations of _PROTEIN_ in and would contribute to the suppression of pi accumulation . in _PROTEIN_ these complemented lines accumulated more shoot pi than _PROTEIN_ due to the overexpression of _PROTEIN_ . four _PROTEIN_ alleles with point mutations have been previously isolated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ presumably leading to the synthesis of truncated _PROTEIN_ proteins . here with the identification of and we isolated two additional _PROTEIN_ alleles designated _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively and therefore used _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ designations respectively for and in the following text . to further explore the genetic inheritance of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations we grew the progeny of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in hydroponic culture to an adult stage . interestingly the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ heterozygotes in the _PROTEIN_ background _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed intermediate shoot pi concentrations between their respective parents suggesting that one copy of the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ allele is sufficient to partially suppress the pi toxicity of _PROTEIN_ . these results also confirmed our speculation that the two close _PROTEIN_ like peaks in the segregation analysis of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ represented the _PROTEIN_ heterozygotes and _PROTEIN_ respectively . in a similar fashion the _PROTEIN_ mutants harboring one copy of the _PROTEIN_ allele _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ also displayed intermediate shoot pi concentrations between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . because these observations appeared contradictory to the earlier report showing that _PROTEIN_ is a recessive allele we thus reexamined the shoot pi concentration of _PROTEIN_ in the wild type background . the shoot pi level of _PROTEIN_ was only slightly but significantly lower than that of wild type plants . apparently the effects of the _PROTEIN_ alleles on the suppression of shoot pi accumulation are more prominent in the _PROTEIN_ background than in the wild type background . next we obtained the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ homozygotes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to explore how _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ would affect pi homeostasis in the wild type background . under pi conditions _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ exhibited reduced shoot pi concentrations and shoot to root ratios of total pi distribution compared with the wild type plants . these results suggest that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are weak _PROTEIN_ alleles with putative roles in pi translocation from root to shoot resulting in minor growth retardation . since both enhanced pi acquisition and root to shoot translocation of pi account for pi overaccumulation in _PROTEIN_ we wondered whether the pi uptake activity of these _PROTEIN_ suppressors was also affected . under pi conditions both _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ exhibited reduced pi uptake activity compared with _PROTEIN_ . furthermore we found that the pi uptake activity of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants was reduced compared with that of the wild type . similar to the magnitude of shoot pi concentrations in these mutants the order of the mutants _PROTEIN_ their respective aberrant pi uptake activity was as follows _PROTEIN_ > _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ > _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ > _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ background wild type > _PROTEIN_ > _PROTEIN_ > _PROTEIN_ in the wild type background . overall _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ alleles impair not only pi translocation from roots to shoots as expected on the basis of the role of _PROTEIN_ in xylem loading but also the process of pi acquisition . to identify the role of _PROTEIN_ downstream of the _PROTEIN_ regulatory pathway we were prompted to check whether _PROTEIN_ is upregulated in _PROTEIN_ . a specific polyclonal antibody against _PROTEIN_ was raised and able to detect a band in the wild type at kd that was absent in the _PROTEIN_ mutant likely corresponding to _PROTEIN_ despite its predicted molecular _METHOD_ of kd . the relatively fast mobility of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a common observation for hydrophobic _LOCATION_ proteins probably resulted from incomplete unfolding or binding of more _PROTEIN_ per _METHOD_ unit protein . strikingly we found that more _PROTEIN_ protein accumulated in the pi root of _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type which was apparently not attributed to a change in transcript abundance . next we compared the protein level of _PROTEIN_ between the wild type and _PROTEIN_ following pi recovery . while pi deficiency induced accumulation of _PROTEIN_ gradually _PROTEIN_ in the wild type over the first h of pi resupply the level of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ declined in the first h and then remained unchanged until the h time point . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is required for downregulation of _PROTEIN_ in response to pi availability . since _PROTEIN_ is assumed to participate in protein modification due to its putative role as a ubc enzyme we then evaluated whether downregulation of _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ is at the posttranslational level . under pi conditions _PROTEIN_ rapidly declined in the wild type in a time course dependent manner in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide with a half life calculated to be min . by contrast the degradation rate of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ was slower than in the wild type suggesting that _PROTEIN_ mediates the downregulation of _PROTEIN_ at the posttranslational level . as one copy of the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ allele is sufficient to reduce the shoot pi accumulation of _PROTEIN_ we speculated that the reduced abundance of _PROTEIN_ variants in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ would contribute to suppression of shoot pi accumulation . indeed the level of _PROTEIN_ variants was remarkably _PROTEIN_ in both _PROTEIN_ suppressors compared with the level of wild type _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ . however the transcript level of _PROTEIN_ was unchanged in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but slightly _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ compared with that of _PROTEIN_ suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ protein level of _PROTEIN_ would have resulted in part from the reduced _PROTEIN_ of transcript . to gain insight into the mechanism behind the reduced steady state level of _PROTEIN_ variants in the _PROTEIN_ suppressors we also examined the stability of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ by application of chx . we found that _PROTEIN_ is more susceptible to degradation than _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ background indicative of the _PROTEIN_ independent intrinsic instability of _PROTEIN_ . by contrast the protein stability of _PROTEIN_ was not affected compared with that of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ background . to our surprise the protein but not the transcript level of _PROTEIN_ variants was increased in the pi root of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ compared with that of the wild type hinting at different _PROTEIN_ involved in regulating the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ is an intrinsic ubc enzyme involved in _PROTEIN_ degradation we generated a mutant construct in which the conserved catalytic active residue cys of _PROTEIN_ was replaced with ala. as expected the _PROTEIN_ of wild type _PROTEIN_ but not of the _PROTEIN_ mutant variant driven by the promoter was able to rescue the phenotype of _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ of the reduction in shoot pi concentrations . accordingly when _PROTEIN_ and wild type _PROTEIN_ were transiently coexpressed in tobacco leaves the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was strikingly reduced in a _PROTEIN_ dosage dependent manner . by contrast the level of _PROTEIN_ remained relatively constant when it was coexpressed with the _PROTEIN_ mutant variant . the unstable nature of _PROTEIN_ when it was coexpressed with the catalytically active _PROTEIN_ suggests that _PROTEIN_ acts as a bona fide ubc enzyme sufficient for downregulation of _PROTEIN_ in planta . to determine which part of _PROTEIN_ is subject to _PROTEIN_ dependent degradation we further generated two truncated variants of _PROTEIN_ on the basis of the _LOCATION_ topology predicted by the conpred ii algorithm . these variants consisted of the n terminal _LOCATION_ region of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the c terminal transmembrane domain region of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . while there was a negative correlation between the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ remained unchanged when it was coexpressed with increasing amounts of _PROTEIN_ . these results demonstrated that the n terminal part of _PROTEIN_ is required for the recognition and/or interaction by _PROTEIN_ . it has been shown that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are both _PROTEIN_ in the vascular tissue of the roots hinting at their potential for direct interaction . we then examined the respective subcellular localizations of _METHOD_ protein tagged _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . when transiently _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected in both reticular and punctate patterns . the _METHOD_ signals were _PROTEIN_ colocalized with the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ but were occasionally colocalized with the endosomal markers suggesting that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was widely distributed in the _METHOD_ . consistent with these observations the functional _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under its native promoter which rescued the _PROTEIN_ phenotype primarily displayed a dotted pattern in the root pericycle cells of the arabidopsis transgenic lines . moreover results from the _LOCATION_ fractionation of the native _PROTEIN_ in both the wild type and _PROTEIN_ reinforced that _PROTEIN_ resided predominantly in the em rather than the pm . by comparison the functional c terminal _METHOD_ protein fusion of _PROTEIN_ colocalized _PROTEIN_ with the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ but rarely with the endosomal markers . of note in contrast with the punctate pattern of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ when _PROTEIN_ alone in the adjacent cell coexpression of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaves gave rise to _LOCATION_ like signals in the em indicating that the subcellular distribution of _PROTEIN_ was altered in the presence of _PROTEIN_ . next we tested whether _PROTEIN_ directly interacts with _PROTEIN_ using bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation assays in tobacco leaves and split ubiquitin yeast two hybrid assays . in the bifc assay while the empty vector controls did not produce any detectable _METHOD_ signal coexpression of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ gave rise to intracellular signals . results from the yeast two hybrid system further showed the interaction between the n terminal portion of _PROTEIN_ and full length _PROTEIN_ supporting our previous conclusion that the n terminal region of _PROTEIN_ is required for _PROTEIN_ mediated degradation of _PROTEIN_ . taken together these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ physically interact in the em . turnover of _LOCATION_ proteins relies on _LOCATION_ proteolysis or proteasome mediated degradation pathways . while mono or diubiquitination has been reported to serve as signals for endocytosis of pm proteins and sorting of _LOCATION_ proteins to the multivesicular bodies polyubiquitination has been _PROTEIN_ associated with the targeting of substrates to the proteasome . as _PROTEIN_ is a potential substrate for _PROTEIN_ dependent ubiquitin modification we intended to determine which protein degradation pathway is involved in the _PROTEIN_ mediated downregulation of _PROTEIN_ . it has been shown that the endosomal protease inhibitor e can prevent degradation of the arabidopsis root pm proteins by attenuating the final step of the endocytic pathway _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ . interestingly the e treatment of the wild type alleviated the downregulation of _PROTEIN_ upon pi resupply and resulted in an increase in the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ after h of pi recovery whereas the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ in the roots of e treated _PROTEIN_ was only slightly affected . in accordance with these results accumulation of _PROTEIN_ under pi conditions was increased in the h e treated wild type in a dosage dependent manner but not in _PROTEIN_ . by contrast the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in wild type seedlings treated with the proteasome inhibitor was gradually _PROTEIN_ in a pi recovery time dependent manner as the _METHOD_ controls suggesting that downregulation of _PROTEIN_ was not blocked by inhibition of proteasome activity . collectively our data support the hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ is required for mvb mediated _LOCATION_ degradation of _PROTEIN_ when pi is adequate . as the genomic _PROTEIN_ construct we used for complementation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ unexpectedly resulted in tissue specific overexpression of _PROTEIN_ we attempted to bring this construct into the wild type and _PROTEIN_ background . interestingly although the abundance of _PROTEIN_ was elevated to the same extent in the _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines as in _PROTEIN_ the shoot pi concentrations were increased by to at most compared with the wild type control and did not reach the levels seen in _PROTEIN_ . by comparison overexpression of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ background aggravated pi toxicity often resulting in the failure of seed development under pi conditions .
