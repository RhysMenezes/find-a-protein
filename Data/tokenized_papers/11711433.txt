phytochromes are plant photoreceptors that regulate plant growth and development with respect to the light environment . following the initial light perception event the phytochromes initiate a signal transduction process that eventually results in alterations in cellular behavior including gene _PROTEIN_ . here we describe the molecular cloning and functional characterization of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ encodes a product _PROTEIN_ that specifically transduces signals downstream of the far red light responsive phytochrome a _PROTEIN_ photoreceptor . we show that _PROTEIN_ is a novel light regulated protein that accumulates in dark grown but not in fr grown hypocotyl cells . in addition _PROTEIN_ transcript levels are regulated by light and by the product of _PROTEIN_ another gene implicated in fr signaling . these observations indicate that _PROTEIN_ function is both fr signal transducing and fr signal regulated suggesting a negative feedback regulation of _PROTEIN_ function . seedlings homozygous for loss of function _PROTEIN_ alleles are partially blind to fr whereas seedlings overexpressing _PROTEIN_ increased responses to fr but not to white or red light . the increased fr responses conferred by overexpression are abolished in a _PROTEIN_ deficient mutant background showing that _PROTEIN_ requires a signal from _PROTEIN_ for function and can not modulate growth independently of _PROTEIN_ .
we cloned _PROTEIN_ using a map based approach . _PROTEIN_ mapped to the bottom of chromosome between markers and _PROTEIN_ . further recombinant mapping using markers from yeast and bacterial artificial chromosome clones on bac . genomic region was sequenced and contains several putative open reading frames . a contig of cosmids covering orfs did not complement the _PROTEIN_ mutant . in addition a single telomeric chromosome breakpoint was detected using an orf derived rflp marker thus excluding orfs from being _PROTEIN_ . we therefore sequenced orfs from the _PROTEIN_ allele and from the wt progenitor and identified a single base pair deletion in orf of _PROTEIN_ thus permitting the tentative identification of _PROTEIN_ . further screens for mutants exhibiting a fr specific elongated hypocotyl phenotype had resulted in the identification of the fast neutron generated _PROTEIN_ allele . molecular analysis using an _PROTEIN_ probe detected an altered restriction fragment pattern in _PROTEIN_ genomic dna . further analysis of _PROTEIN_ revealed that this mutation is caused by an inversion of an kb dna fragment from chromosome . this inversion interrupts _PROTEIN_ and disrupts the _PROTEIN_ . in addition _PROTEIN_ transcripts were detected in _PROTEIN_ at reduced level in _PROTEIN_ plants but not in _PROTEIN_ plants . these observations suggest that _PROTEIN_ is a loss of function allele of _PROTEIN_ . furthermore because the fr response phenotypes conferred and _PROTEIN_ are indistinguishable it is likely that _PROTEIN_ is also a loss of function allele of _PROTEIN_ . final proof that the gene tentatively identified as _PROTEIN_ is indeed _PROTEIN_ was obtained via genetic complementation . when grown in cfr the _PROTEIN_ mutant displays an elongated hypocotyl and unexpanded cotyledons . a kb genomic fragment spanning bp upstream to bp downstream of the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence fully conferring a phenotype resembling that of the wild type control . _PROTEIN_ encodes a predicted polypeptide _PROTEIN_ of kd that is rich in serine and glutamic acid residues . _PROTEIN_ has no obvious overall similarity to any protein of known function and contains putative _LOCATION_ localization sequence and _LOCATION_ export sequence domains . _PROTEIN_ lacks a single adenine residue bp downstream of the _PROTEIN_ start codon resulting in a premature _PROTEIN_ codon . database searches revealed the existence of a second arabidopsis orf that encodes a predicted protein that is related in sequence to _PROTEIN_ together related ests from soybean and tomato . interestingly _PROTEIN_ contains a region of shared homology with part of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a domain . the biological significance of this shared homology is unknown because it does not overlap with the region of the _PROTEIN_ domain that is conserved in _PROTEIN_ domain proteins involved in a variety of roles from photoperception to circadian clock function . it seemed likely that seedling _PROTEIN_ levels are related to morphogenesis in cfr for the _PROTEIN_ loss of function allele confers a cfr specific elongated hypocotyl phenotype . we addressed this possibility in two ways . first we investigated the environmental and genetic _PROTEIN_ that gene _PROTEIN_ . second we studied the effect of increased _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ on morphogenesis in cfr . we examined _PROTEIN_ mrna levels in seedlings grown in cd and in various light conditions cwl cr and cfr . in wild type seedlings _PROTEIN_ levels accumulated to higher levels in cd than in any light condition suggesting that light negatively regulates _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in cfr but not in cwl or cr _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were higher in _PROTEIN_ deficient _PROTEIN_ seedlings than in wild type seedlings . therefore _PROTEIN_ reduces _PROTEIN_ levels in cfr and other photoreceptors do the same in cwl and cr . when etiolated wild type seedlings were moved into cfr _PROTEIN_ levels _PROTEIN_ within an hour of exposure and then remained unchanged . this response was not observed inphya seedlings and is therefore _PROTEIN_ dependent . this rapid _PROTEIN_ dependent down regulation of _PROTEIN_ mrna levels indicates the existence of a negative feedback loop whereby _PROTEIN_ influences the abundance of _PROTEIN_ transcripts and possibly of _PROTEIN_ itself . like the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutants _PROTEIN_ double mutant displayed a reduced cfr response . however the cfr grown _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ hypocotyl was only slightly longer than that of _PROTEIN_ and a strongly synergistic cfr blind phenotype was not observed . this observation suggests that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may act in the same pathway and that in addition to the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pathway additional pathways may mediate the cfr response . alternatively _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may act in separate pathways . we investigated _PROTEIN_ mrna levels in _PROTEIN_ . in all conditions _PROTEIN_ seedlings accumulated less _PROTEIN_ transcript than did wild type seedlings showing that _PROTEIN_ positively regulates _PROTEIN_ mrna levels and suggesting that _PROTEIN_ acts downstream of _PROTEIN_ . furthermore _PROTEIN_ seedlings still exhibited light dependent reductions mrna levels suggesting that these reductions are not _PROTEIN_ dependent . because cfr and _PROTEIN_ have opposite effects on _PROTEIN_ levels _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant was investigated . in cfr _PROTEIN_ mrna levels in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were intermediate between those _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ and were similar to those of wild type . this suggests that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcript levels independently of each other . the above observations on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ present a paradox reductions in _PROTEIN_ function _PROTEIN_ reduce the cfr response but apparent reductions in _PROTEIN_ function _PROTEIN_ are also part of the cfr response . to resolve this paradox we investigated the consequences of increasing _PROTEIN_ plants that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of the camv promoter had elevated _PROTEIN_ transcript levels in cd cwl and cfr . these plants exhibited an enhanced cfr response being more deetiolated in cfr than wild type plants . therefore overexpression enhances the fr response above that of wild type plants . to determine if this effect was fr specific plants were also grown in cd cr and cwl . in all cases _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants were indistinguishable from wild type controls thereby showing that the effect of _PROTEIN_ overexpression is light dependent and fr specific . furthermore these observations suggest that the paradox outlined above can be resolved if _PROTEIN_ function is subject to negative feedback regulation via _PROTEIN_ at the transcriptional level . we investigated the effect of _PROTEIN_ overexpression in the _PROTEIN_ deficient _PROTEIN_ mutant . as shown in _PROTEIN_ plants containing _PROTEIN_ construct are blind to cfr and indistinguishable from control _PROTEIN_ plants . to confirm that these plants were _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ construct rna gel blot analysis showed that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ line transcripts to levels comparable with that seen in the control _PROTEIN_ line . therefore overexpression causes enhanced cfr responses in the presence but not in the absence of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ can not influence growth in the absence of a signal from _PROTEIN_ suggesting that the enhanced fr responses of plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are attributable to a _PROTEIN_ dependent enhancement of the _PROTEIN_ signal . in further experiments we investigated the consequences overexpression in mutant plants containing a partially defective _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ encode mutant _PROTEIN_ polypeptides whose function is reduced but not completely abolished . for example _PROTEIN_ confers a hypocotyl that is taller than wild type but shorter than that conferred by the _PROTEIN_ null allele in high intensity cfr indicating that _PROTEIN_ function is reduced compared with that of _PROTEIN_ . in low intensity cfr the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ hypocotyls are of a more similar length . when the _PROTEIN_ construct was introduced intophya it partially suppressed the cfr phenotype _METHOD_ . in hi cfr conditions the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ had shorter hypocotyls than the _PROTEIN_ controls an effect that was less apparent in lo cfr . these effects are cfr dependent because when grown in cd these lines were fully etiolated . furthermore the _PROTEIN_ also suppressed the phenotype of _PROTEIN_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ overexpression suppresses the general effects of a reduced _PROTEIN_ signal rather than any specific effects of the individual mutant _PROTEIN_ alleles . these observations suggest that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ enhances responses to a reduced _PROTEIN_ signal . the intracellular localization of _PROTEIN_ was investigated using plants containing a transgene construct that _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter . preliminary experiments showed that this construct complemented the _PROTEIN_ thus showing that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein has _PROTEIN_ function . _METHOD_ microscopy was used to determine the intracellular location of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein . as shown in strong _METHOD_ was observed in the _LOCATION_ of the hypocotyl cells of cd grown _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants but not in hypocotyl _LOCATION_ of cfr grown _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants or of cd or cfr grown control plants . in addition as shown in figure weak _METHOD_ was also observed in the cytoplasm of the hypocotyl cells of cd grown _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants . this _METHOD_ was clearly brighter than the background _METHOD_ seen in nontransgenic controls . therefore _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is distributed _METHOD_ between the _LOCATION_ and the cytoplasm of cd grown hypocotyls although the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ is stronger than that of the cytoplasm . in further experiments we looked to see if the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ would change rapidly following transfer of seedlings from cd to cfr . these experiments showed that the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ attributed to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was still detectable h after transfer to cfr . in addition there appeared to be a slight increase in cytoplasmic _METHOD_ following h of cfr . however the _PROTEIN_ that clear _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ was retained following the h cfr treatment suggests that _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is not rapidly relocalized or destroyed following transfer of hypocotyls from cd to cfr . additional experiments showed that _METHOD_ due to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in seedlings first grown in cd is reduced by subsequent light treatments of longer duration . we observed that h of cfr was needed to reduce the _METHOD_ to almost undetectable levels . interestingly treatments with cb cr or cwl resulted in a more rapid loss with _METHOD_ essentially disappearing between and h of the onset of exposure .
throughout this paper the wild type is arabidopsis thaliana ecotype landsberg _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are as described . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were identified in a fast neutron mutagenized wild type population . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were identified in an ethyl methane sulfonate mutagenized wild type population and contain missense alleles that confer a substantial reduction in but not complete loss of _PROTEIN_ function . all putative double mutant homozygotes were test crossed to both parents to confirm their genotypes . mapping populations were generated by crossing _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ with wild type . dna from _PROTEIN_ or plants was analyzed with cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence and simple sequence length polymorphism markers . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ .was mapped to the bottom of chromosome with and recombinant chromosomes identified between _PROTEIN_ and the markers _PROTEIN_ respectively . we designed a caps marker with the . analysis of the recombinant chromosomes enabled us to between the markers and _PROTEIN_ . with these two markers and published data we constructed a new yeast artificial chromosome map of the region . total yeast dna from the selected cic yacs and yup clones was extracted according to citation . the yac ends r l r and l were isolated by inverse pcr for the right end or by plasmid rescue for the left end and converted into rflp markers . nylon filters spotted with the igf and _PROTEIN_ bacterial artificial chromosome libraries of arabidopsis genomic dna were screened with the labeled l marker . the relative positions of the bacs were determined by using bac end derived markers isolated as described abamhi subclone of the bac a pcr product of gene and the r fragment . analysis of the _PROTEIN_ recombinants showed that an rflp marker derived from bac mapped centromeric to _PROTEIN_ thus showing that covers _PROTEIN_ . the cdna library was screened with a fragment of the second exon of _PROTEIN_ . fourteen positive clones were isolated from pfu of which were sequenced . these cdnas represented a single gene _PROTEIN_ . total rna was extracted from cd grown wild type seedlings and _PROTEIN_ was performed using the marathon kit and primer . pcr products were cloned into the pgem t easy vector and two clones were sequenced . the _PROTEIN_ transcript contains an in frame _PROTEIN_ codon upstream of the first _PROTEIN_ suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ orf represents the complete _PROTEIN_ protein . for molecular complementation with constructs containing _PROTEIN_ plant transformations were as described . dna sequencing was performed using the big dye terminator cycle sequencing kit . total rna was separated on denaturing gels and transferred onto hybond nx . an pcr fragment was cloned into the pgem t easy vector and used to make an utp labeled rna probe _METHOD_ . the ribosomal control was as in citation . in vitro seedling growth medium was as described in citation but without sugar . for fr light sources were bulbs output filtered through black plexiglass for r bulbs output filtered through fire red filter intensity for wl as described in citation . light intensities were measured with a li cor model li b radiometer with a li cor pyranometer probe . a pcr product amplified from a subclone of bac using primers and was cloned in the pgem t easy vector isolated as a bglii/saci fragment and inserted behind the camv promoter in abamhi/saci opened derivative vector . the construct was introduced into _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ andphya mutants . transformants were kanamycin selected and the progeny were tested in cfr . transformants grown in cd were indistinguishable from untransformed controls . a _PROTEIN_ was crossed with _PROTEIN_ and progeny of this cross were screened for plants homozygous for both the _PROTEIN_ mutation and the transgene . the _PROTEIN_ gene and bp of upstream sequence were amplified by pcr from a genomic dna clone inserted upstream of and in frame with the _METHOD_ coding sequence in a derivative vector and then transformed into _PROTEIN_ . seedlings were examined under uv light with a leica dmrxa microscope equipped with filter a and filter _PROTEIN_ for _METHOD_ and dapi _METHOD_ respectively . for dapi staining of the _LOCATION_ seedlings were dipped in isopropanol for a few seconds rinsed in water stained in dapi for min washed min in water and mounted on a microscope slide . images were acquired using a spot camera . for the photographs in figure a and b the transgenic and control seedlings were mounted side by side on the same slide and both photographs were taken with the same microscope and camera settings . the _METHOD_ line is in the ws background .
