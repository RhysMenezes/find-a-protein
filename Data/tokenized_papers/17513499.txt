vertebrate tpr and its yeast homologs long coiled coil proteins of _LOCATION_ pore inner basket filaments are involved in mrna export telomere organization spindle pole assembly and unspliced rna retention . we identified arabidopsis thaliana _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ encoding a kd protein with similarity to tpr . _PROTEIN_ is located at the inner surface of the _LOCATION_ envelope in interphase and in the vicinity of the spindle in prometaphase . four t dna insertion lines were characterized which comprise an allelic series of increasing severity for several correlating phenotypes such as early flowering under short days and long days increased abundance of sumo conjugates altered _PROTEIN_ of several flowering regulators and _LOCATION_ accumulation of poly rna . nua mutants phenocopy mutants of early in short _PROTEIN_ an arabidopsis sumo protease concentrated at the _LOCATION_ periphery . nua _PROTEIN_ double mutants resemble nua and _PROTEIN_ single mutants suggesting that the two proteins act in the same pathway or complex supported by yeast two hybrid interaction . our data indicate that _PROTEIN_ is a component of _LOCATION_ pore associated steps of sumoylation and mrna export in plants and that defects in these processes affect the signaling events of flowering time regulation and additional developmental processes .
_PROTEIN_ was identified in a targeted phenotypic screen of t dna insertion mutants in arabidopsis genes coding for long coiled coil proteins that might play a structural organizational role in the _LOCATION_ or the endomembrane system . the genes were selected by the following criteria from the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis coiled coil protein database . the proteins should be at least amino acids long with a coiled coil coverage of at least and either a _LOCATION_ localization signal or at least one predicted transmembrane domain . for all selected open reading frames t dna insertion lines generated by the salk institute genomic analysis laboratory were acquired from the _PROTEIN_ and segregating populations were screened for visible phenotypes to identify proteins with an experimentally approachable biological role . nua was identified as an extreme early flowering mutant that was stunted in growth and had _PROTEIN_ defects in the inflorescence . the translated open reading frame of _PROTEIN_ has significant sequence similarity to mammalian tpr an inner _LOCATION_ pore associated long coiled coil protein . figure shows the coiled coil domains in _PROTEIN_ in comparison to human tpr drosophila melanogaster megator and yeast and . the size of the predicted protein the length of the coiled coil domain the presence of a non coiled coil c terminal tail and the distribution of predicted nls are very similar in _PROTEIN_ and the known tpr like proteins . using the full length _PROTEIN_ protein in wu blast against the plant gene indices homologous partial protein sequences with a significant identity and similarity can be recovered from various plant species including rice maize wheat and potato . hence _PROTEIN_ is evolutionarily conserved both among and within different _METHOD_ . based on the existing est and microarray data _PROTEIN_ appears to be _PROTEIN_ ubiquitously in all tissues and during all developmental stages . this was also confirmed by rt pcr with different tissues including root stem flower silique and cauline leaf . three additional t dna insertion alleles of _PROTEIN_ were identified . flanking sequences of the t dna insertion sites were amplified by pcr and sequenced . the original allele nua has an insertion at nucleotide _PROTEIN_ the nua insertion causes a bp deletion between nucleotides and and nua has an insertion at nucleotide . the insertion site of nua was mapped to nucleotide . the _PROTEIN_ cdna was cloned by rt pcr and the partial cdna fragment encoding amino acids to was used to _PROTEIN_ his tagged protein in escherichia coli and generate an antiserum _PROTEIN_ that detects a protein of an extrapolated molecular _METHOD_ of kd . figure shows that after immunoprecipitation no kd protein was detected in nua _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . a weak band of approximately full length size was detected in nua and a band corresponding to a truncated protein of kd in nua . _PROTEIN_ protein was also absent in nua . analysis of _PROTEIN_ transcripts by rt pcr showed that the locus is transcribed both upstream and downstream of the t dna insertion in nua nua and nua but that no transcript was detected across the insertion . by contrast a small amount of full length transcript in addition to truncated transcripts was detected across the nua insertion . the truncated bands were sequenced and indicated that alternative splicing leads to in frame deletions of bp or bp . all pcr products were derived from specific cdna templates since they were not present in the control reactions in which reverse transcriptase was omitted and since all primer pairs span introns . we speculate that either mrna is synthesized through the t dna insertion or that a transcript reads out of the t dna into the _PROTEIN_ gene . in any case no protein in the _PROTEIN_ open reading frame is made downstream of the t dna insertions of nua and nua because it would be detectable with our antibody . in summary we conclude that nua and nua are likely null mutations . in nua a small amount of full length protein and/or almost full length proteins with short internal deletions are present . in nua a partial protein of kd is made . all four lines flowered early in long days . nua and nua were the most extreme alleles and bolted with to rosette leaves in long days while nua and nua bolted with to and to leaves respectively . nua nua and nua also flowered early in short days with nua again being the most severe nua being moderate and nua being a mild allele . in addition to early flowering nua nua and nua also showed stunted inflorescences and smaller narrower rosette leaves while adult nua plants were indistinguishable from the wild type . flowering time of wild type columbia and nua mutants given as number of rosette leaves at time of bolting nua and nua showed several additional developmental alterations not found in nua and nua . the inflorescence of the mutants showed some abnormalities with a reduced number of flower buds on the top of the _PROTEIN_ inflorescence . siliques were found at unexpected positions two or three siliques were positioned at one node or at the top of the _PROTEIN_ inflorescence . in addition indeterminate shoots were found in one node together with a silique and a cauline leaf . the size of siliques of the mutants was shorter and more stunted compared with the wild type with fewer developed seeds per silique . furthermore the majority of flowers did not set seeds . the stamens of the mutants were shorter and the size of _PROTEIN_ was slightly smaller than the wild type . together we conclude that loss of _PROTEIN_ leads to severe developmental defects and that the isolated t dna insertions comprise an allelic series of increasing severity in the order nua nua and nua . we used _METHOD_ with anti _PROTEIN_ to characterize the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ in root tip cells of arabidopsis seedlings . in interphase cells _PROTEIN_ is clearly located at the _LOCATION_ envelope . during prometaphase at the onset of spindle formation the antibody decorated a structure in the vicinity of the spindle which did not directly colocalize with tubulin . during metaphase this signal was less obvious . during cytokinesis _PROTEIN_ reappeared at the _LOCATION_ envelope . supplemental figure online shows that the ne signal is absent in nua indicating that anti _PROTEIN_ specifically decorates _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ envelope . to determine if _PROTEIN_ is associated with the inner _LOCATION_ envelope we performed double labeling in plants _PROTEIN_ a green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion of _PROTEIN_ an arabidopsis outer _LOCATION_ envelope/npc associated protein . figure shows that the _PROTEIN_ signal could be clearly resolved inside the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signal indicating that _PROTEIN_ is indeed associated with the inner surface of the _LOCATION_ envelope . the observed pleiotropic phenotype of nua and nua is reminiscent of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations . to investigate their genetic interaction homozygote nua plants were crossed with _PROTEIN_ plants resulting in a wild type phenotype for all seedlings in the generation . double mutants in the generation were indistinguishable from nua and _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ of flowering time under long day conditions . the only difference observed was that nua _PROTEIN_ had even shorter stamens and reduced fertility than the single mutants . these data suggest that nua and _PROTEIN_ might act in a shared pathway or complex that affects flowering time as well as vegetative and inflorescence development but that they act additively in stamen development . this notion is supported by the interaction of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in yeast two hybrid assays indicating that _PROTEIN_ binds specifically to the n terminal amino acids of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is a sumo protease associated with the _LOCATION_ envelope . mutations in _PROTEIN_ lead to an increase in sumo conjugates and a _PROTEIN_ in free sumo . to test if mutations in _PROTEIN_ have a similar molecular phenotype we investigated the sumo conjugation pattern in nua nua nua and nua compared with the t dna insertion allele _PROTEIN_ and wild type columbia plants . in _PROTEIN_ the level of high molecular weight sumo conjugates was increased while the free sumo level was reduced as described previously . we found that nua and nua phenocopy _PROTEIN_ and that nua leads to an intermediate and nua to the least increase of sumo conjugates . the level of free sumo was reciprocally altered in all alleles . _PROTEIN_ mutations have been shown to _PROTEIN_ the mrna level of the floral repressor _PROTEIN_ and increase mrna levels of the floral activators flowering locus t _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ of overexpression of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to test whether the nua mutants would also phenocopy these effects we tested mrna abundance of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ by semiquantitative rt pcr . indeed as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ mrna level is strongly reduced in nua and nua comparable to _PROTEIN_ and is somewhat reduced in nua and nua with nua showing the weakest effect . consistently _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrna levels were found inversely affected . since nua and nua flower significantly earlier than the flc null mutant additional _PROTEIN_ involved in flowering time regulation are likely affected in nua mutants . additionally the _PROTEIN_ mutation was also suggested to promote flowering both through and independently of _PROTEIN_ . to probe into additional effects of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations on the flowering pathways we tested mrna levels of several additional floral repressors and floral integrators . _PROTEIN_ one of the _PROTEIN_ paralogs also implied in floral repression was _PROTEIN_ in nua nua nua and _PROTEIN_ . furthermore the phytohormone gibberellin is known to promote floral transition strongly under short day conditions via activating the floral integrator _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by gamyb transcription _PROTEIN_ . when the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were analyzed elevation in nua and nua mutants was apparent again supporting the notion that several flowering pathways were affected in the nua mutants . we noted that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels were not significantly altered in _PROTEIN_ supporting an overlapping but not identical effect of the two gene knockouts on flowering regulator _PROTEIN_ . if _PROTEIN_ acted as a _LOCATION_ pore anchor for _PROTEIN_ as predicted for the interaction between and in yeast depletion of _PROTEIN_ should lead to a release of _PROTEIN_ from the _LOCATION_ periphery . we tested this model by investigating the localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in wild type columbia and the nua mutant alleles . figure shows that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ has a _LOCATION_ location with enrichment at the _LOCATION_ envelope in root cell files consistent with previous reports for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . figures to and supplemental figure online show that no significant changes in this pattern were seen in nua nua nua and nua suggesting that the increase in sumo conjugates in nua mutants is unlikely to be based on delocalization of _PROTEIN_ . both mammalian tpr and yeast have been implicated in affecting mrna export . while poly rna accumulates in _LOCATION_ immunodepleted of tpr and in cells that overexpress _LOCATION_ tpr fragments double mutants of and show no _LOCATION_ mrna accumulation . however they are affected in the _LOCATION_ retention of mis spliced rnas and binds hnrnps . using in situ hybridization with an oligo probe we tested if the nua mutant alleles accumulate more _LOCATION_ poly rna compared with the wild type . figure and supplemental figure online show that indeed all four mutant alleles show higher _LOCATION_ signals than the wild type . significantly the amount of _LOCATION_ signal detected correlated well with the severity of the mutant alleles in _METHOD_ of flowering time sumo conjugate abundance flowering regulator _PROTEIN_ and developmental defects . in all assays employed nua and nua were the most severe alleles followed by nua as intermediate and nua as the mildest allele .
