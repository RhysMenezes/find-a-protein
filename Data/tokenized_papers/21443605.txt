the signal transduction _METHOD_ of the oxidative stress response in plants remain largely unexplored . previously increased levels of cellular hydrogen peroxide had been shown to drastically affect the plant transcriptome . transcriptome analyses allowed us to build a comprehensive inventory of genes in plants . here the primary objective was to determine the subcellular localization of these genes and to assess potential trafficking during oxidative stress . after cloning in vectors the subcellular localization of proteins fused to the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ was identified in a transient assay in tobacco by means of and confirmed for a selection of genes in transgenic arabidopsis thaliana plants . whereas eight of the _METHOD_ proteins are exclusively localized in the _LOCATION_ reside both in the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ in which several classes of known transcription _PROTEIN_ and proteins of unknown function can be recognized . in this study the mapping of the subcellular localization of proteins paves the way for future research to unravel the responses in plants . furthermore the effect of increased levels on the subcellular localization of a subset of proteins was assessed .
firstly we compared the available microarray data sets that profiled the arabidopsis transcriptome during elevated photorespiratory levels . perturbation of catalase activities by mutation or gene silencing results in _PROTEIN_ scavenging during _PROTEIN_ stress or low _PROTEIN_ availability in plants . catalase mutants are an ideal in planta model system to examine the consequences of increased levels of endogenous because disturbance in homeostasis can be sustained over time no invasive techniques are needed and physiologically relevant levels are obtained . in three independent studies the transcriptome of _PROTEIN_ transgenic arabidopsis leaves perturbed in the most predominant catalase _PROTEIN_ was assessed by three different microarray _METHOD_ affymetrix genechip _PROTEIN_ catma microarray and agilent arabidopsis oligonucleotide array . by monitoring different time points after _PROTEIN_ exposure the dynamics of the transcriptional response could be investigated . these transcriptome analyses allowed us to build a comprehensive inventory of higs in arabidopsis . to make a robust selection of higs for further functional studies the induction of each transcript was studied in all three experiments . to understand the early signalling steps triggered by an abrupt change in availability we selected genes that responded within to h after shifting the lines to higher irradiance . for a comparison a fold threshold was used as selection criterion for differential gene _PROTEIN_ . a total of transcripts had a modified _PROTEIN_ in response to elevated levels of photorespiratory and were designated higs . an assessment of overrepresented go _METHOD_ within these higs by means of the bingo tool revealed that the majority of the genes were associated with stress responses . the most significant go term was response to stimulus . pairwise comparisons of the three data sets indicated that approximately of the transcripts were induced in at least two experiments . this intersection was significantly enriched in transcripts belonging to the response to heat go term which is in accordance with the relationship between the oxidative and heat stress responses . many small heat shock proteins together with other _PROTEIN_ and heat shock _PROTEIN_ are substantially by photorespiratory . in _PROTEIN_ of all heat genes are by in plants . in total genes are common for all three data sets and are enriched in genes belonging to the go molecular function oxidoreductase activity . the subcellular localization is a key functional characteristic of eukaryotic proteins . to properly execute their biological functions proteins must be targeted to or retained in the correct subcellular compartments or organelles in time or during a particular stimulus . to obtain a first indication of the subcellular localization we used the publicly available and in silico prediction program _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ adopts features calculated with against the database and employs a naive bayes algorithm to assign a protein in different subcellular compartments _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ chloroplast _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ apparatus lysosome _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in silico prediction of subcellular localizations is an asset in the _LOCATION_ of generating proteomic transcriptomic and genomic data . however it still remains a cumbersome task especially in plants for which the nature or sequence characteristics of many targeting signals are largely elusive . of the higs _PROTEIN_ assigned proteins to a specific compartment of which the majority was predicted to reside in the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . for transcripts we initiated an experimental validation of the subcellular location . the selection of these transcripts was based on three criteria namely _PROTEIN_ computational predictions functional category and responsiveness towards various abiotic stresses . to focus on the most strongly transcripts of the higs we retained only transcripts with at least a fivefold increase in _PROTEIN_ . we selected predominantly proteins that were predicted to reside in the _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ and omitted chloroplastic or _LOCATION_ predicted proteins and categorized as transcription _PROTEIN_ and/or _LOCATION_ proteins and genes of unknown function . in addition we assessed the responsiveness of the selected transcripts under abiotic stress conditions with the atgenexpress abiotic stress time series and the and light series and retained only those transcripts that were induced by multiple abiotic stresses . in total transcripts were obtained by these consecutive selection steps and their abiotic stress response profiles and subcellular localization are presented . not surprisingly because of the applied selection criteria most members are predicted as _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ of which the majority are transcription _PROTEIN_ acid binding . because our future objective is to identify regulators within signalling networks these proteins are primary candidates for possible shuttling between the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ under oxidative stress conditions . when the patterns for the higs were considered by means of the web tool _PROTEIN_ almost all genes were part of one or two tightly networks . besides providing insights into the networks based on transcriptome data _PROTEIN_ also integrates the protein interactome localization data and functional information of arabidopsis . for these proteins the aim was to fuse the open reading frames to _METHOD_ both at the and ends under the control of the constitutive promoter with plant transformation vectors . we successfully obtained _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusion constructs that were subsequently used in a protein localization assay of abaxial epidermis cells of tobacco leaves via transient _PROTEIN_ . both the simplicity of the gateway cloning and the transient infiltration assay provided the desired necessary for such screening . the subcellular localization could be rapidly determined in situ in photosynthetically active leaves which corresponded to tissues in which the higs originally had been identified . this technique results in a high transformation frequency in comparison with infiltration mesophyll cell transfection or biolistic bombardment of cell cultures in arabidopsis . the subcellular localization for each construct was analysed d after agrobacterium infiltration in at least two independent transformation events . from constructs in total localization data were obtained for different proteins but for the remaining ones no detectable _METHOD_ signal was observed or the construction of _METHOD_ fusions was unsuccessful . whereas eight _METHOD_ proteins were exclusively located in the _LOCATION_ resided both in the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . as expected nearly all _LOCATION_ proteins were transcription _PROTEIN_ or _LOCATION_ proteins . an exclusively _LOCATION_ localization was seen only for two shsps . three proteins displayed a chloroplastic localization including unexpectedly a petunia no apical meristem arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and cuc transcription _PROTEIN_ . of the six proteins present in the endomembrane compartment two had distinct _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localizations . for seven proteins the subcellular localization could not be assigned to a particular subcellular compartment . comparison between the in silico predictions and our experimental data revealed the strength of _PROTEIN_ for _LOCATION_ proteins . almost all members belonging to the functional category transcription _PROTEIN_ protein were predicted to be _LOCATION_ . these proteins show a _LOCATION_ or nucleocytosolic localization in vivo thereby confirming the in silico _LOCATION_ predictions . in addition the majority of the proteins with an unknown function predicted to be _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ were also confirmed in vivo . however it is important to keep in _PROTEIN_ that the prediction of a subcellular localization of a protein can not replace experimental data because _PROTEIN_ other than the presence of a targeting sequence can define its subcellular localization . for instance interacting partners can sequester the protein to another subcellular compartment and some proteins have a dynamic localization depending on the plant 's developmental stage or environmental stimuli encountered . although _METHOD_ tagging of a protein can provide insights into the in vivo subcellular localization some considerations have to be taken into account . firstly the position of the _METHOD_ tag can alter the location of the native protein . for example interactions with other proteins can be abrogated and misfolding can occur . secondly constitutive overproduction of the tagged protein can saturate interaction partners and organellar import machineries leading to protein misfolding and aggregation . thirdly in contrast transgenic production of fusion proteins under the control of the native promoter often generates a very weak signal that in turn might limit the throughput of the assay . notwithstanding these considerations the strategy used here allows a fast generation of data in a relatively small time frame . the localizations of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and have recently been described and confirm our observations whereas the localizations of cytokinin response _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and by oxidative stress differed from previously published localizations and will be discussed next . to validate our findings of the transient _PROTEIN_ assay we produced stably transformed transgenic arabidopsis plants to allow homologous gene _PROTEIN_ and examination of different cell types . in addition the overall impact of overproduction of the fusion proteins on plant development and the _PROTEIN_ towards environmental stimuli can be assessed . with the same constructs as those in the transient assay stable transgenic arabidopsis plants were obtained for of the proteins . at least two independent transgenic lines per construct were analysed . except for two proteins _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ the tobacco subcellular localization of all fusion proteins was confirmed in arabidopsis . in this survey we analysed the subcellular location of transcription _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ proteins such as wrky myb _PROTEIN_ nac _PROTEIN_ and basic . seven fusion proteins from this category localized exclusively to the _LOCATION_ resided both in the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ and one localized unexpectedly in chloroplasts . in total nine members of the nac transcription _PROTEIN_ family were induced by photorespiratory of which five were included in this study _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . based on the presence of a _LOCATION_ localization signal all were predicted by _PROTEIN_ as _LOCATION_ . in vivo only _PROTEIN_ appeared to be exclusively _LOCATION_ while the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was observed also in the _LOCATION_ . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ had previously been identified as possible _LOCATION_ nac proteins and designated as nac with transmembrane motif _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ proteins are released and hence activated by a controlled proteolytic cleavage mechanism called rip which provides a rapid activation of these nac proteins in response to incoming stimuli . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ display a nucleocytosolic localization in tobacco besides a vesicular pattern visible in the case of _METHOD_ which might be caused by that results in ros accumulation and activation of a defence response . in turn this might lead to regulated proteolysis thereby releasing _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ where they are directed to the _LOCATION_ by the presence of a _LOCATION_ localization signal . as both proteins possess strong transmembrane motifs that suggest a _LOCATION_ localization this hypothetical relocalization is currently under investigation . besides being _PROTEIN_ is also induced under hypoxic conditions . in the transient assay the localization pattern of _PROTEIN_ differed depending on the position of the _METHOD_ tag when _METHOD_ was positioned at the it was _PROTEIN_ nucleocytosolic although a cytoskeletal localization was apparent as well but _METHOD_ proteins displayed an exclusively chloroplastic localization both in tobacco and in transgenic arabidopsis plants . to exclude that ectopic _PROTEIN_ by the strong promoter caused this chloroplastic localization we assessed the subcellular location of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter sequence in stable transgenic lines of arabidopsis . while no _METHOD_ signal was detected for _METHOD_ _METHOD_ again with chloroplasts . increasing evidence is available that _LOCATION_ regulators such as transcription _PROTEIN_ are present in organelles like mitochondria and _LOCATION_ . under certain conditions these organellar transcription _PROTEIN_ might be released and subsequently targeted to the _LOCATION_ . several _METHOD_ are plausible for release and _LOCATION_ trafficking such as proteolytic cleavage of _LOCATION_ proteins transport by vesicles release via channels or transporters stromule tip shedding and close intercompartmental contacts . the _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ family is plant specific and comprises approximately genes that are characterized by the presence of a _PROTEIN_ domain of amino acids . in our analysis five members of the _PROTEIN_ superfamily were included _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . both _METHOD_ fusions of _PROTEIN_ localized to the _LOCATION_ and were excluded from the nucleolus . _PROTEIN_ also known as _PROTEIN_ is induced under hypoxic conditions and involved in low oxygen signalling . upon transient _PROTEIN_ in tobacco _METHOD_ localizes to the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ and _METHOD_ to the _LOCATION_ . in arabidopsis however the fusion protein displays an exclusively _LOCATION_ localization . discrepancies between localizations in tobacco and arabidopsis might hint towards putative relocalizations during oxidative stress . to investigate the behaviour of _PROTEIN_ during oxidative stress a transient _PROTEIN_ assay in arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts was used but no nucleocytosolic partitioning occurred after the addition of mm or mm . this study also included _PROTEIN_ . crfs are a small subclass of _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ and are characterized by their transcriptional regulation by cytokinins . arabidopsis contains in total eight crf genes that all have a unique crf domain . interestingly six members of the crf family relocalize from the _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ upon cytokinin treatment . here _PROTEIN_ has a clear nucleocytosolic localization which is in contrast with the previous observation that _PROTEIN_ is exclusively _LOCATION_ . in total we studied proteins of unknown function and could assign them to different subcellular compartments chloroplasts _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ and no specific compartment . despite the absence of a genuine transit peptide the only protein targeted to the chloroplasts is _GENE_ although it had been predicted as _LOCATION_ by _PROTEIN_ illustrating the need to experimentally validate in silico predictions . six proteins of unknown function have an _LOCATION_ and/or _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization _PROTEIN_ . transient _PROTEIN_ of both _GENE_ and _GENE_ indicated an _LOCATION_ localization whereas ectopic overexpression of _METHOD_ in arabidopsis also revealed a large granular localization . because of the hydrophobic nature of this protein this localization might be an artefact . both _METHOD_ fusions of _GENE_ and _PROTEIN_ in tobacco and arabidopsis appeared in a perinuclear _PROTEIN_ which is characteristic for an _LOCATION_ localization . _PROTEIN_ contains four helical transmembrane regions and a of the . our observations indicate a punctuate _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ . because rhomboid proteins are integral _LOCATION_ serine proteases known to be involved in rip it would be interesting to identify substrates that are potentially cleaved by _PROTEIN_ under oxidative stress conditions . furthermore higs with unknown function displayed a _LOCATION_ or nucleocytosolic localization whereas seven fusion proteins had no specific subcellular localization . the localization of _GENE_ a protein exhibited _LOCATION_ characteristics . another protein _GENE_ is an unknown _LOCATION_ glycophosphatidylinositol protein that contains an signal peptide for targeting into the secretory pathway and an hydrophobic peptide necessary for in _LOCATION_ . however removal of this by cleavage can result in a redistribution in the soluble compartment . interestingly the transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ in tobacco revealed a perinuclear _PROTEIN_ a vesicular pattern some features of the tonoplast and a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization . presumably the presence of the _METHOD_ tag at the blocks the secretory signal peptide leading to mistargeting whereas the hydrophobic site still allows the association with internal _LOCATION_ resulting in this particular localization . for the localization differed depending on the position of the _METHOD_ tag . _METHOD_ had a distinct granular pattern and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization whereas production of the fusion protein resulted in _METHOD_ in some _LOCATION_ cells but a clear _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization in most cells . therefore we assume that is located in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the localization of _METHOD_ displayed _LOCATION_ features such as the perinuclear _PROTEIN_ and a reticular pattern . one of the most highly induced higs of our data set contains a domain of unknown function _PROTEIN_ . the localization of the _METHOD_ fusion again shows _LOCATION_ features . however it is very likely that the presence of _METHOD_ hampers efficient _LOCATION_ targeting . contains three domains one dipeptidyl peptidase iv region domain one repeat and one domain . in tobacco _METHOD_ again showed the characteristic perinuclear _PROTEIN_ and a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization but in arabidopsis only a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization was apparent . upox had previously been identified as a mitochondrial oxidative stress marker protein . in tobacco _METHOD_ localizes to punctate structures and to the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ whereas in arabidopsis it has a nucleocytosolic localization . further detailed studies are necessary to pinpoint the exact localization of these unknown proteins . besides transcription _PROTEIN_ and proteins of unknown function some transcripts with miscellaneous functions were also included in our study because of their strong induction by photorespiratory . _METHOD_ a phosphoprotein tyrosine phosphatase localized to the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . for _PROTEIN_ which is involved in iron sulphur metabolism we could confirm the previously reported chloroplastic localization . furthermore we also determined the localization of heat genes including two shsps _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a dnaj protein and . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ belong to the class i subfamily suggesting a _LOCATION_ localization . interestingly transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ in tobacco revealed in addition to a _LOCATION_ also a granular localization . these granules resemble the heat stress granules _PROTEIN_ formed under elevated temperatures into which shsps together with other _PROTEIN_ are incorporated . in arabidopsis transgenic plants generated with the same _METHOD_ construct only a _LOCATION_ localization was found suggesting that these _PROTEIN_ might also be formed under other stress conditions such as the accumulation of ros that results from agrobacterium infiltration . in contrast to the suggested _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ it was nucleocytosolic both in tobacco and arabidopsis . an ortholog of the human and yeast _PROTEIN_ had recently been published as a protein that interacts with _PROTEIN_ . transient _PROTEIN_ in mesophyll protoplasts of _METHOD_ revealed a nucleocytosolic localization in agreement with our observation . the use of _METHOD_ fusion proteins also enables an in vivo localization to subcompartments . for instance some proteins of our study localize to subnuclear structures . besides a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization _GENE_ had a punctate _LOCATION_ pattern that is thought to be involved in mrna splicing . moreover the _LOCATION_ localization pattern of _GENE_ also showed a _PROTEIN_ around the nucleolus which is the site of rdna transcription and ribosome biogenesis . because of the lack of evidence for a functional border between the _LOCATION_ and the nucleolus nucleolar targeting is based on direct and indirect interactions with rdna and its transcripts . the nucleolar _PROTEIN_ localization might be assigned to one of the three morphological components of the nucleolus . both _GENE_ and _GENE_ displayed an increased accumulation in the nucleolus . in _PROTEIN_ the nucleolus is considered to play a role in multiple stress responses . a dnaj heat shock protein localized in _LOCATION_ speckles in tobacco . transient _PROTEIN_ of in arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts showned in a nucleocytosolic localization whereas the addition of mm resulted in an exclusively _LOCATION_ localization in almost of the protoplasts .
for the comparative analysis on transcriptional changes induced in plants after _PROTEIN_ exposure we compiled the data of one stored and two published microarray experiments that were generated with different _METHOD_ . a previous comparison of affymetrix _PROTEIN_ agilent and complete arabidopsis transcriptome microarray arrays revealed a comparable sensitivity and a fair agreement of signal intensities . from the affymetrix _PROTEIN_ data set genes showing at least a threefold induction in _PROTEIN_ plants after h of _PROTEIN_ exposure were selected whereas from the agilent arabidopsis data set genes showing a significant induction in _PROTEIN_ plants after h of _PROTEIN_ exposure were retained and from the catma experiment a data set was created of genes showing a significant induction in _PROTEIN_ plants after h of _PROTEIN_ irradiation . protein sequences were downloaded from the arabidopsis information resource converted to fasta format and analysed in proteome analyst _PROTEIN_ a tool for prediction of protein features . within the different tools of genevestigator the response viewer was used to find the response profiles of individual genes to various environmental stimuli . out of the different conditions annotated the atgenexpress abiotic stress time series and atgenexpress light treatments and were selected . _PROTEIN_ values were across each gene and subjected to hierarchical average linkage clustering using the genesis software . overrepresented gene ontology _METHOD_ in the hig data set were identified with the biological networks gene ontology tool in cytoscape . the hypergeometric test was chosen at a significance value of with the benjamini and hochberg false discovery rate correction for multiple testing . the online data mining tool _PROTEIN_ networks _PROTEIN_ provides insights into networks with transcriptome data and integrates proteome data localization data and functional data of arabidopsis . out of the different predefined data sets available the atgenexpress abiotic stress time series were used . with the tool the pearson correlation coefficient threshold was set > and pairwise correlation between higs was calculated . the output was visualized in cytoscape . open reading frames and promoters were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from cdna and genomic dna of arabidopsis thaliana heynh . ecotype columbia respectively with primers extended with the attb sites for gateway cloning . pcr reactions were run with phusion dna polymerase and fragments were cloned into gateway entry vectors according to the manufacturer 's instructions . constitutive _PROTEIN_ clones were generated in the binary destination vectors and resulting in and green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusions respectively under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . endogenous translational fusions were created with the multisite gateway technology that combined the open reading frames and _METHOD_ fragments downstream of the endogenous promoter in the destination vector . all constructs were transferred into the agrobacterium tumefaciens strain harbouring the virulence plasmid _PROTEIN_ . the _METHOD_ constructs for protoplast transfection were made by means of the plasmids and resulting in and fusions respectively . all _METHOD_ fusion constructs were transiently _PROTEIN_ in leaf epidermal cells of tobacco by agrobacterium leaf infiltration . arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts were prepared and transfected according to yoo cho sheen . protoplasts were incubated in washing and incubation solution ethanesulfonic acid ph and mm kcl supplemented with mm or mm at . to identify potential relocalizations the subcellular localization of in total three times protoplasts was assessed at different time points by laser scanning confocal microscopy . for stable _PROTEIN_ the constructs were transformed into arabidopsis plants by floral dip . plants were selected on _METHOD_ medium sucrose agar ph and mg kanamycin at and dark photoperiod . for each construct plants were analysed for _METHOD_ _METHOD_ using laser scanning confocal microscopy . homozygous lines with a single locus were selected by segregation . the adaxial leaf epidermis was scanned by _METHOD_ microscopy with a confocal microscope m and software package lsm version equipped with a water corrected objective . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was imaged in a single channel setting with nm for _METHOD_ excitation .
