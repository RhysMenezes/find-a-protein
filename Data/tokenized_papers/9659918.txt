arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ acts as a light inactivable repressor of photomorphogenic development but its molecular mode of action remains unclear . here we show that _PROTEIN_ negatively regulates _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ protein and a positive regulator of photomorphogenic development . both in vitro and in vivo assays indicate that _PROTEIN_ interacts directly and specifically with _PROTEIN_ . the hyperphotomorphogenic phenotype caused by the overexpression of a mutant _PROTEIN_ which lacks the _PROTEIN_ interactive domain supports the regulatory role of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction . further _PROTEIN_ is capable of directly interacting with the _PROTEIN_ minimal promoter and is essential for its light activation . we propose that the direct interaction with and regulation of transcription _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ may represent the molecular mechanism for its control of gene _PROTEIN_ and photomorphogenic development .
to examine the possible physical interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ an in vitro binding assay was performed . as shown in citation a the amount of p labeled _PROTEIN_ retained by the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ beads increased proportionally with increasing amounts of _PROTEIN_ applied . further the level of _PROTEIN_ retained by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ beads was significantly higher than the background level of _PROTEIN_ retained by the control _PROTEIN_ beads . since equal amounts of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were used in the binding experiment our results indicate a specific and direct protein protein interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in vitro . to substantiate the observed in vitro _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction and to dissect the specific protein domains involved a yeast two hybrid protein protein interaction assay was _PROTEIN_ . as illustrated in citation b chimeric fusion protein of the lexa dna binding domain and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ activated transcription of the lacz reporter gene in the presence of activation domain _PROTEIN_ fusion _PROTEIN_ but not with activation domain alone suggesting a direct protein protein interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in yeast cells . to determine the specific _PROTEIN_ protein domain that mediates its interaction with _PROTEIN_ a deletion series of _PROTEIN_ was constructed and fused to the lexa dna binding domain . as illustrated in citation b deletion of the n terminal amino acids leaving the basic plus leucine zipper _PROTEIN_ domain of _PROTEIN_ intact completely abolished its ability to interact with _PROTEIN_ . by contrast deletion of the leucine zipper domain or the entire _PROTEIN_ domain only marginally affected its interaction with _PROTEIN_ . further deletion analysis of _PROTEIN_ indicated that although the n terminal amino acids were essential for _PROTEIN_ to interact with _PROTEIN_ they were not sufficient for mediating _PROTEIN_ interaction . to ensure that the different degrees of interaction observed were not due to differences in protein _PROTEIN_ western blot analysis was conducted . all of the lexa _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins were _PROTEIN_ at similar levels except lexa and lexa which were slightly higher and could account for the slightly stronger interaction between lexa and ad _PROTEIN_ . together our data demonstrate that the n terminal amino acids of _PROTEIN_ are both necessary and sufficient for mediating direct interaction with _PROTEIN_ . hence _PROTEIN_ consists of at least two distinct functional modules one for the presumed dimerization and dna binding activity _PROTEIN_ and the other for interacting with _PROTEIN_ . in a parallel experiment to dissect _PROTEIN_ 's structural requirement for interacting with _PROTEIN_ a series of _PROTEIN_ deletions were constructed and fused to the hemagglutinin epitope tagged activation domain . since the various ad _PROTEIN_ chimeric constructs were _PROTEIN_ at similar protein levels as detected by western blot analysis their relative strength of interaction with _PROTEIN_ should be reflected by the respective reporter galactosidase activities . citation c showed that while deletion of the _PROTEIN_ finger had no significant effect on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction deletion of the coiled coil domain reduced _PROTEIN_ 's ability to interact with _PROTEIN_ by half . further deletion of both the _PROTEIN_ finger and the coiled coil domain almost completely abolished _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction indicating that the _PROTEIN_ finger and the coiled coil domain were essential for interacting with _PROTEIN_ . however neither the n terminal fragment that contains both the _PROTEIN_ finger and the coiled coil domain nor the c terminal fragment that contains all of the wd repeats nor an internal fragment was sufficient to mediate the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ . the apparent lack of specific _PROTEIN_ interactive domain in _PROTEIN_ suggests that the overall protein structure of _PROTEIN_ as well as specific sequences may be critical for its molecular association with _PROTEIN_ . this is consistent with the observation that functional _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ may be involved in both intermolecular and intramolecular interaction and folding . to investigate a possible interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in living plant cells we tagged both proteins with a green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and analyzed their subcellular localization patterns in living onion epidermal cells . punctate green _METHOD_ speckles were observed in a weak and uniform green _METHOD_ background in the _LOCATION_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ onion cells . in addition _METHOD_ inclusion bodies were detected in the cytoplasm presumably due to an overaccumulation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . note that the subcellular localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was essentially the same as that of gus _PROTEIN_ reported previously . in contrast of the onion epidermal cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein displayed a uniformly bright green _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ pattern exclusively in the _LOCATION_ . the contrasting _LOCATION_ localization patterns of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ inspired an assay for their in vivo interaction the recruitment of _PROTEIN_ into _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ speckles . when _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was coexpressed with nontagged full length _PROTEIN_ protein in the onion epidermal cells bright green _LOCATION_ speckles were consistently observed throughout the uniform green _METHOD_ background . since uniform _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ signal was observed when _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ alone the detection of _LOCATION_ green _METHOD_ speckles when _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was coexpressed with the nontagged full length _PROTEIN_ would support the recruitment of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ into the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ speckles . to verify the specificity of such interaction _METHOD_ itself was coexpressed with the same nontagged full length _PROTEIN_ . of the cells showed a uniform _METHOD_ pattern in the _LOCATION_ and none displayed the _LOCATION_ speckles indicating that the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ speckles were indeed due to the specific association of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ speckles . hence these data strongly support the in vivo interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in living plant cells . the clear separation of the _PROTEIN_ interactive domain from the putative dna binding and dimerization domain for _PROTEIN_ raised the possibility that _PROTEIN_ consists of two distinct functional modules the _PROTEIN_ domain that presumably interacts with target gene promoters and/or other transcription _PROTEIN_ to regulate gene _PROTEIN_ and the n terminal amino acids that interact with its negative regulator _PROTEIN_ . a direct prediction from this model would be that the overexpression of a mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ that lacks the _PROTEIN_ interactive domain will uncouple _PROTEIN_ 's negative regulation on _PROTEIN_ activity and hence lead to a hyperactive _PROTEIN_ . to test this prediction two constructs that constitutively overexpress either the full length _PROTEIN_ or the mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were stably introduced into arabidopsis . as predicted the overexpression of the mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ created a hyperphotomorphogenic phenotype in the light grown seedlings . the dramatic reduction in the hypocotyl lengths and the elevated accumulation of anthocyanin at the upper hypocotyls were clearly evident in the _PROTEIN_ overexpressing seedlings grown in continuous white far red blue and red light . in addition precocious development of chloroplasts was observed in the hypocotyls and the roots of day old and week old light grown seedlings respectively . by contrast overexpression of the full length _PROTEIN_ caused no significant effect on hypocotyl and cotyledon development . in addition precocious development of chloroplasts was also not observed in the roots . since the protein level of _PROTEIN_ was similar to if not lower than that of full length _PROTEIN_ in transgenic arabidopsis the observed phenotypes of the _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines could best be explained by its higher activity in activating photomorphogenic development than full length _PROTEIN_ . further the ability of _PROTEIN_ to partially rescue the elongated hypocotyl phenotype of the null mutant indicates that _PROTEIN_ itself is physiologically active . it is however impossible to confirm whether _PROTEIN_ is quantitatively more active than the wild type _PROTEIN_ due to the extremely low level of _PROTEIN_ protein in the mutants possibly due to transgene silencing . interestingly no deviant phenotype was observed when the full length _PROTEIN_ and the truncated _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines were grown in darkness . this result suggests that a hyperactive _PROTEIN_ alone may not be sufficient to activate photomorphogenic development . to further elucidate the nature of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction we examined their roles in regulating _PROTEIN_ root development . consistent with previous studies mutations in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ resulted in contrasting root developmental defects . _PROTEIN_ root initiation was severely inhibited in _PROTEIN_ a weak _PROTEIN_ mutant as compared to the wild type . by contrast a dramatic increase in the number and the length of the _PROTEIN_ roots was observed in the mutant . further / _PROTEIN_ double mutants developed an increased number and length of their _PROTEIN_ roots resembling the single mutants indicating that can suppress the root defects of _PROTEIN_ . these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ acts to repress _PROTEIN_ root initiation and elongation while _PROTEIN_ plays a positive role in _PROTEIN_ root development possibly by negatively regulating the repressive activity of _PROTEIN_ . to gain further insights into the antagonistic roles of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ root development we examined the effects of overexpressing full length _PROTEIN_ and an n terminal fragment of _PROTEIN_ on root development in transgenic plants . consistent with a positive regulatory role the overexpression of full length _PROTEIN_ led to an increased number of _PROTEIN_ roots as well as an increased number and length of root hairs when compared to the wild type . in contrast the overexpression of a dominant negative form of _PROTEIN_ resulted in short primary roots that lacked _PROTEIN_ roots . since was unable to interact with _PROTEIN_ but capable of interacting with full length _PROTEIN_ its effect on root development could be best explained by its unproductive intermolecular interaction with the endogenous _PROTEIN_ and thus compromising _PROTEIN_ 's ability to physically interact with _PROTEIN_ and negatively regulate _PROTEIN_ . the resulting lack of down regulation of _PROTEIN_ activity would lead to a hyperactive _PROTEIN_ and hence hyperrepression of _PROTEIN_ root development . taken together the data would be consistent with a direct protein protein interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in regulating root development . however this does not exclude other possible _METHOD_ of regulatory interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . to examine whether _PROTEIN_ is directly involved in mediating light regulated gene _PROTEIN_ we chose to analyze the effect of _PROTEIN_ on the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ synthase gene _PROTEIN_ which encodes the first committed step for anthocyanin biosynthesis . _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ and anthocyanin accumulation are highly inducible by light stimulus and are regulated by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in a contrasting fashion . to examine the effect of _PROTEIN_ on _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ two _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ reporter constructs were introduced into a null mutant background and the _PROTEIN_ patterns of the transgenes were analyzed . the two promoters used were the mustard _PROTEIN_ full length promoter and its minimal light responsive promoter fragment fused to a basal promoter . both promoters when fused with gus reporter displayed proper _PROTEIN_ patterns with _PROTEIN_ to tissue specificity and light regulation in transgenic arabidopsis . in this study very low activity was observed for both _PROTEIN_ full length and unit promoters in the dark grown wild type and seedlings with gus staining restricted to the cotyledons . in the light however clear elevation of _PROTEIN_ promoter activity in the cotyledons and most dramatically in the roots was detected in the wild type but not in the mutants . further quantitative gus assays showed a to fold induction of the _PROTEIN_ and promoter activity in the wild type while the light inducibility of both promoters was completely abolished in the mutants . these results confirmed the essential role of _PROTEIN_ in mediating light activation of _PROTEIN_ gene promoter a sharp contrast to the repressive role of _PROTEIN_ in repressing _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ . the antagonistic roles of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in regulating _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ suggest that _PROTEIN_ may repress _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ by directly interacting with _PROTEIN_ and down regulating _PROTEIN_ ability to activate _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ that mutation caused similar effects on _PROTEIN_ and promoter activity strongly suggests that _PROTEIN_ regulates _PROTEIN_ promoter activity through the minimal light responsive promoter unit unit which is both necessary and sufficient for the light inducibility of _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ . to test whether _PROTEIN_ directly bind to the minimal light responsive region of the _PROTEIN_ promoter mentioned above a gel mobility retardation assay using recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein and a bp _PROTEIN_ promoter fragment containing unit as a probe was carried out . indeed _PROTEIN_ specifically bound to the _PROTEIN_ promoter to form a slower mobility protein dna complex . furthermore the association of _PROTEIN_ with the _PROTEIN_ probe was abolished when _PROTEIN_ with an excess of unlabeled unit suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ binding site was located within the unit region . since unit of the _PROTEIN_ promoter was reported to contain at least two essential and highly conserved protein binding sites which include a g box like motif we seek to define the specific _PROTEIN_ binding site by competition with unlabeled light responsive elements _PROTEIN_ such as g _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the binding of _PROTEIN_ to the _PROTEIN_ promoter was abolished when _PROTEIN_ with an excess of unlabeled synthetic consensus g box tetramer but not with tetramers of two other distinct light responsive promoter elements _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . this data is further supported by the finding that _PROTEIN_ can specifically bind to the labeled g box sequences in vitro by both gel mobility retardation and footprinting assays . hence our results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is capable of specifically binding to the _PROTEIN_ promoter via direct contact with the essential g box motif .
