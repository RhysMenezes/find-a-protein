little is known about the dynamics and molecular components of plant prevacuolar compartments in the secretory pathway . using transgenic tobacco bright yellow cells _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ anchored yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ reporters marking _LOCATION_ or pvcs we have recently demonstrated that pvcs are mobile multivesicular bodies defined by _LOCATION_ sorting receptor proteins . here we demonstrate that _LOCATION_ and pvcs have different sensitivity in response to brefeldin a treatment in living tobacco by cells . bfa at low concentrations induced _METHOD_ marked _LOCATION_ stacks to form both _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ hybrid structures and bfa induced aggregates but had little effect on _METHOD_ marked pvcs in transgenic by cells at both confocal and immunogold electron microscopy levels . however bfa at high concentrations caused both _METHOD_ marked _LOCATION_ stacks and pvcs to form aggregates in a dose and time dependent manner . normal _LOCATION_ or pvc signals can be recovered upon removal of bfa from the culture media . confocal _METHOD_ and immunogold electron microscopy studies with specific organelle markers further demonstrate that the pvc aggregates are distinct but physically associated with _LOCATION_ aggregates in bfa treated cells and that pvcs might lose their internal vesicle structures at high bfa concentration . in addition _LOCATION_ sorting receptor marked pvcs in root tip cells of tobacco pea mung bean and arabidopsis upon bfa treatment are also induced to form similar aggregates . thus we have demonstrated that the effects of bfa are not limited to _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ but extend to pvc in the endomembrane system which might provide a quick tool for distinguishing _LOCATION_ from pvc for its identification and characterization as well as a possible new tool in studying pvc mediated protein traffic in plant cells .
we have previously demonstrated that vsr proteins are markers for defining pvcs in plant cells . more recently we have developed two transgenic tobacco by cell lines _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ reporter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the pvc reporter _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and demonstrated that these two reporters colocalized with mani and vsr antibodies respectively . we further demonstrated that pvcs in tobacco by cells are mvbs that are marked by vsr proteins . as a first step to compare reporter marked _LOCATION_ to pvc directly in transgenic living tobacco by cells we further developed a new transgenic tobacco by cell line _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion in which the _METHOD_ was used to replace the _METHOD_ in the previous _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct . similar to the transgenic cell line _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ typical punctate _METHOD_ signals were detected from cells _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . furthermore organelles marked by either _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were mostly colocalized with vsr antibodies indicating pvc localization of both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in transgenic tobacco by cells . _LOCATION_ localization of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ reporter and pvc localization of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ reporter in transgenic by cells were further confirmed by immunoem studies where _METHOD_ antibodies specifically labeled _LOCATION_ stacks or mvb in transgenic by cells _PROTEIN_ either _LOCATION_ or pvc reporters . thus similar to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ reporter served as a tool for defining pvcs/mvbs in tobacco by cells . therefore from now on both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cell lines were used as pvc markers in this study . bfa has been a useful tool in studying protein trafficking in the secretory pathway because this drug induced _LOCATION_ stacks to form enlarged compartments and prevented protein traffic from the _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ . using transgenic tobacco by cell lines _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ and pvc reporters we have recently demonstrated that _LOCATION_ and pvc had different sensitivity to wortmannin in which the drug induced the pvc but not the _LOCATION_ to dilate . because the _LOCATION_ and pvc are closely related organelles in the secretory pathway using transgenic by cell lines _PROTEIN_ pvc reporters we therefore wanted to study the possible effects of bfa on pvcs . as a control a transgenic cell line _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ reporter was used . we first performed a dose response experiment in which day transgenic cell lines _PROTEIN_ either the _LOCATION_ or pvc reporters were incubated with various concentrations of bfa for h before the treated cells were collected and used in confocal imaging . day by cells have been used in our drug treatment studies because these cells are at their log phase and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusions remain in pvcs as punctate patterns which will be targeted to _LOCATION_ as diffusion patterns at day and day . as shown in figure in cells _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ typical enlarged compartments were observed in all cells treated with bfa at tested concentrations from to and the average sizes of the visible bfa induced aggregates were larger in cells treated with higher concentrations of bfa . to our surprise in cells _PROTEIN_ the pvc marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ bfa at high concentrations also induced the _METHOD_ marked pvcs to form similar aggregates even though low bfa concentrations did not have any visible effect on the size and number of _METHOD_ marked pvcs . similar results were obtained when cells were treated with bfa with various concentrations for h before confocal imaging . in addition similar results were also obtained when another transgenic cell line _PROTEIN_ the pvc marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was used in a similar study . bfa at induced the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ marked _LOCATION_ to form aggregates in transgenic by cells this result is consistent with several previous studies showing bfa induced _LOCATION_ aggregation in different cell types . however several other studies showed that bfa at such concentrations also induced _METHOD_ marked _LOCATION_ to form _LOCATION_ patterns in both by and tobacco leaf cells . to find out the possible causes for such observed differences we collected by cells at day and day for bfa treatment at for h before confocal imaging . day and day cells represent the log phase and the stationary phase respectively . as shown in supplemental figure similar punctate patterns were observed in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ cells collected at either day or day . at the end of h bfa treatment major aggregation patterns were observed from day cells or day cells but typical _LOCATION_ patterns were observed from bfa treated day cells or day cells indicating that the physiological status of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ by cells may affect its responsive patterns to bfa treatment . however when the same bfa treatments were performed using transgenic _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ by cells _LOCATION_ patterns were observed from both bfa treated day and day cells . we do not know whether such observed differences are due to the difference between the trans _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and the cis _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ or to the different cell line used but such differences shall not affect this study on the effects of bfa on pvcs/mvbs where the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ cells were used as a control for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ marked pvc/mvbs in by cells . to study further the dynamics of the bfa induced response of pvcs to high concentrations of bfa a time course study was carried out using these two transgenic cell lines . day individual transgenic cell lines were first incubated with bfa at a minimal concentration that induced pvcs to form aggregates followed by sample collection at indicated times after bfa treatment for confocal imaging . as shown in figure in cells _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ enlarged bfa induced aggregates were already detected min after bfa treatment and these aggregated structures remained throughout the h period of bfa treatment . in contrast in cells _PROTEIN_ the pvc marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ no bfa induced _METHOD_ marked aggregates were detected and the number of _METHOD_ marked pvcs remained unchanged during the first min of bfa treatment but similar aggregates were observed from min after bfa treatment and these aggregates remained detectable thereafter for h . thus when comparing to _LOCATION_ stacks a min delay was observed for pvcs to form bfa induced aggregates in response to bfa at under these conditions . low concentrations of bfa have been commonly used in studying protein trafficking and organelle dynamics in tobacco by cells . in cells treated with bfa at this low concentration the normal _LOCATION_ apparatus can usually recover upon removal of the drug from the culture medium . it is thus believed that the formation of bfa induced compartments and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ hybrids is not caused by the toxic effect of bfa on by cells . to find out whether bfa at or is toxic to by cells and causes permanent damage we performed a recovery study . day transgenic cells _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and pvc marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were treated with bfa at for h followed by washing off the bfa with fresh medium and then sampling collections at indicated time points upon recovery for confocal imaging . as shown in figure in cells _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signals in both aggregates and an _LOCATION_ pattern were detected and min after bfa washing which was then followed by disappearance of aggregates reappearance of punctate signals and weakening of the _LOCATION_ pattern after h and a fully punctate pattern was eventually observed after h . these results indicate that the _LOCATION_ pattern can be recovered fully upon bfa removal . similar patterns of changes were also detected in cells _PROTEIN_ the pvc marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ upon removal of bfa and again normal punctate signals were recovered after h . furthermore the bfa treated by cells during the recovery period still looked normal as judged by their appearance in the differential interference contrast images . similar results were obtained when cells were treated with bfa at for h followed by washing off bfa in the recovery study in these two cell lines . these results demonstrate that bfa at or did not permanently damage the treated by cells and that the bfa induced aggregates from either _LOCATION_ or pvc organelles can be fully recovered into typical punctate patterns upon removal of bfa . therefore both _LOCATION_ apparatus and pvcs in transgenic by cells demonstrated the ability of recovery even in high doses of bfa treatment at or . bfa at to induced formation of aggregates that may represent _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ hybrid structures in by cells . our results thus far indicated that bfa at or induced both _LOCATION_ apparatus and pvcs to form aggregates in transgenic by cells . because both _METHOD_ marked _LOCATION_ and pvc exhibit similar punctate patterns before bfa treatment and form similar aggregates in the presence of bfa it is thus possible that the bfa induced aggregates were derived from _LOCATION_ and pvc fusion . to find out whether bfa induced aggregates derived from _LOCATION_ and pvc remain distinct or fusion upon bfa treatment we performed the following _METHOD_ labeling study . day transgenic by cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ reporters were treated with bfa at for and h followed by fixation and labeled with vsr antibodies for subsequent confocal imaging . as shown in figure the pvc/mvb marker vsr antibodies detected aggregates in fixed transgenic cells _PROTEIN_ either the _LOCATION_ or pvc reporter . interestingly in fixed transgenic by cells _PROTEIN_ the pvc marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ the bfa induced aggregates derived from the _METHOD_ marked pvcs colocalized with aggregates detected by vsr antibodies . in contrast in fixed by cells _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ bfa induced aggregates derived from the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ marked _LOCATION_ remained largely distinct from the aggregates marked by the pvc marker vsr antibodies at or h after bfa treatment . in addition most of these aggregates derived from _LOCATION_ and pvc showed close association and tended to join together . these results demonstrate that bfa induced aggregates derived from _LOCATION_ stacks are different from those derived from pvcs in by cells and that vsr proteins remain intact within the pvc derived aggregates in by cells . to further investigate the nature and relationship of bfa induced aggregates derived from _LOCATION_ and pvc in response to bfa treatment we then performed a time course experiment using transgenic cells _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . these transgenic cells were first incubated with bfa at followed by sample collection and fixation at an indicated time point before the fixed cells were used in labeling with vsr antibodies for subsequent confocal imaging analysis . as shown in figure bfa induced aggregates marked by the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were already detected min after bfa treatment and these aggregates remained similar throughout the h treatment period . in contrast the vsr marked pvcs remained unchanged during the first min whereas vsr marked aggregates became visible and gradually increased in h . in addition aggregates derived from _LOCATION_ and pvc remained distinct but closely associated . the differential response of _LOCATION_ and pvc to bfa treatment was consistent with results obtained from living cells . to find out whether the effect of bfa on the formation of pvc derived aggregates is a primary effect on a pvc target or a secondary effect of transport from the _LOCATION_ to the pvc we performed the following experiments using two phospholipase inhibitors ono rs and bromoenol lactone which have been used to inhibit the effect of bfa in mammalian cells . in addition ono in mammalian cells targets and disrupts the _LOCATION_ apparatus . transgenic by cells _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were pretreated with ono rs at for min followed by addition of bfa at or for an additional hour before confocal imaging . as shown in figure bfa at either or induced the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ marked _LOCATION_ to form aggregates in cells without pretreatment with ono rs . similar aggregates were observed in cells pretreated with ono rs at for min followed by bfa treatment at either or indicating that this drug did not block the bfa effect on _LOCATION_ at either low or high concentrations . however in transgenic by cells _PROTEIN_ the pvc marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ bfa at induced the _METHOD_ marked pvc to form aggregates in cells without pretreatment with ono rs but no such aggregates were observed in cells pretreated with ono rs at for min indicating that the drug prevents the formation of bfa induced pvc aggregates . when a similar drug bel was used to pretreat cells before bfa treatment at it did not block the formation of bfa induced aggregates from _LOCATION_ or pvc indicating that ono rs was specific for pvc . these results clearly demonstrated that bfa acts on different targets on the _LOCATION_ and the pvc whereas ono rs did not prevent the formation of bfa induced aggregates from the _LOCATION_ the drug blocked the formation of bfa induced pvc aggregates . therefore it is likely that bfa acts on distinct targets on _LOCATION_ and pvc respectively even though its molecular mechanism of actions on _LOCATION_ and pvc remained to be illustrated in plant cells . confocal _METHOD_ studies thus far demonstrate that bfa at high concentration induced both _LOCATION_ and pvc to form aggregates that are closely adjacent to each other . to further identify and study the morphological structures of these bfa induced aggregates and their relationship immunoem studies were then carried out where _METHOD_ and vsr antibodies were used to detect _LOCATION_ stacks and pvcs respectively in transgenic _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ by cells . day _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic by cells were treated with bfa at for h before they were fixed by glutaraldehyde and embedded in lowicryl . ultrathin sections were then prepared for immunoem labeling . as shown in figure normal _LOCATION_ apparatus was specifically labeled by _METHOD_ antibodies in untreated control cells . in contrast in bfa treated cells curved _LOCATION_ aggregates were labeled specifically by _METHOD_ antibodies which may likely represent the bfa induced aggregates derived from the _LOCATION_ apparatus . because no visible mvbs were detected in ultrathin sections prepared from lowicryl blocks we therefore prepared samples using a high pressure frozen/freeze substituted protocol for immunoem studies . as shown in figure in the untreated control cells multivesicular pvcs were clearly labeled by vsr antibodies and labeling was _PROTEIN_ on the peripheral regions . similarly in bfa treated cells similar sizes of vesicles were also labeled specifically by vsr antibodies to their peripheral _LOCATION_ . moreover unlike untreated cells where pvc/mvbs were often identified individually these vsr labeled vesicles were often detected as groups that tended to pack together and thus might be derived from pvc aggregation or vesiculation . however these aggregated vesicles containing vsr proteins seem to lose their mvb appearance because no visible internal vesicles were detected from these vsr labeled pvcs under these conditions . to study further the details of these _LOCATION_ or pvc derived aggregates in response to bfa treatment we then performed structural transmission electron microscopy studies using conventional chemical fixation and subsequent embedding in spurr 's resin as previously described . first day transgenic _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ by cells were treated with bfa at and for h. cells were then prepared for tem analysis as described . as shown in supplemental figure in untreated control cells normal _LOCATION_ apparatus and typical multivesicular pvcs were detected . in addition in cells treated with a low concentration of bfa typical bfa induced _LOCATION_ aggregates with visible _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ hybrids were observed whereas normal multivesicular pvcs remained unchanged in size and morphology . however in cells treated with bfa at many aggregated vesicles with sizes of to nm but lacking internal vesicular structures were often observed in these bfa treated cells a result consistent with the immunoem study in which aggregated vesicles were found to be labeled by vsr antibodies in bfa treated cells . such detection was due to bfa treatment because no such aggregated vesicles around the _LOCATION_ apparatus were observed in untreated cells . thus these aggregated vesicles may represent bfa induced aggregates derived from pvcs in by cells . similar vesicle aggregates were also observed from arabidopsis root tip cells treated with bfa at for h indicating that such bfa effect on pvc is not limited to tobacco by cells . we have thus far demonstrated that bfa at high concentrations induced both _LOCATION_ and pvc to form aggregates in tobacco by cells and that aggregates derived from _LOCATION_ and pvc remained distinct but closely associated . to find out whether such a bfa response is unique to by cells or can also be observed in other cell types we performed additional bfa induction experiments using root tip cells of various plants . mature seeds of mung bean pea arabidopsis and transgenic tobacco _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were first germinated before the root tips were treated with bfa at and for h followed by fixation and immunolabeling with vsr antibodies . as shown in figure typical punctate patterns were observed in tobacco root tip cells _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and these _METHOD_ marked _LOCATION_ formed aggregates in the presence of bfa at either or a result consistent with that observed in transgenic _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ by cells . these results indicated that bfa at high concentrations induced the _LOCATION_ to form aggregates in tobacco root tip cells . in contrast bfa at low concentrations did not induce any changes in the vsr marked pvcs but bfa at high concentrations induced the vsr marked pvcs to form aggregates in root tip cells of mung bean pea and arabidopsis . moreover pvc derived aggregates in arabidopsis root tip cells look similar to those in by cells . therefore bfa at high concentrations induced _LOCATION_ and pvc to form aggregates in root tip cells of various plants in a way that is similar to that of by cells .
general methods for construction of recombinant plasmids characterization of cloned inserts transformation of tobacco by cells _PROTEIN_ of transgenic tobacco by cells and preparation and characterization of antibodies have been described previously . by cells were _PROTEIN_ by subculture twice a month on agar plates or every d in liquid cultures at room temperature . liquid cultures were kept in shakers at rpm . _METHOD_ with a signal peptide sequence from proaleurain _METHOD_ was amplified by pcr and subcloned into the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct via hindiii/ecori sites to replace the _METHOD_ and resulted in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the resulting _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct was then transformed into the agrobacterium followed by transforming by cells as previously described . in addition transgenic tobacco plants _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the pvc reporter _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were generated via agrobacterium mediated transformation as previously described . for bfa treatment experiments aliquots of bfa solution were added to and d old suspension cultures to give the proper final concentrations . bfa treated cells were then removed from the cultures at indicated times for direct confocal imaging or fixed for confocal _METHOD_ and em . for recovery experiments by cells were treated with bfa at indicated concentrations followed by centrifugations at low speed and washing three times with fresh murashige and skoog medium before samples were used for confocal imaging or fixation . on average more than cells were observed to obtain similar results for each experiment . all drug treatment experiments had been repeated at least two to three times with similar results to make sure that the drugs were functional and the cells used were at the same or similar physiological stages . for drug treatment using obo rs and bel aliquots of the ono rs and bel solution were added to to d old suspension cultures to give the proper final concentrations and incubated for min followed by addition of bfa at indicated final concentrations and incubated for h. the treated cells were then collected and subjected to direct confocal imaging . production and characterization of vsr antibodies were described previously . secondary lissamine rhodamine conjugated affinity purified anti rabbit antibodies were _PROTEIN_ from jackson immunoresearch laboratories . fixation and preparation of tobacco by cells labeling and analysis by _METHOD_ and confocal _METHOD_ have been described previously . the parameters for collecting confocal images within the linear range were settled as previously described . for single labeling of polyclonal rabbit vsr antibodies were incubated at overnight . all confocal _METHOD_ images were collected using a bio rad radiance system . images were processed using adobe photoshop software as previously described . for samples embedded in lr white and lowicryl for immunoem studies cells were fixed in ml of a primary fixative solution containing glutaraldehyde and paraformaldehyde in mm phosphate buffer ph for min at room temperature and then transferred to for an additional h. after washing with phosphate buffer at room temperature cells were dehydrated in an ethanol series and then embedded in lr white and lowicryl resin . for samples embedded in spurr 's resin for structural tem studies cells were fixed in ml of a primary fixative containing glutaraldehyde and ml of saturated picric acid in mm caco buffer ph for min at room temperature and then transferred to for an additional h. after washing with mm caco buffer ph cells were further subjected to a secondary fixative solution containing osmium tetroxide and potassium ferrocyanide in mm caco buffer ph for h at room temperature . the cells were then washed with mm caco buffer ph followed by contrasting at aqueous uranyl acetate for h at room temperature . after washing twice in water cells were dehydrated in an acetone series and finally embedded in spurr 's resin . for sample preparation using high pressure frozen/freeze substituted procedures were performed essentially as described previously . ultrathin sections were then prepared from these blocks and used in either immunoem or structural tem studies as described . vsr and _METHOD_ antibodies were used in immunoem studies . the following materials are available in the online version of this article . supplemental figure . bfa induces _METHOD_ marked pvcs to form aggregates in a dose dependent manner . supplemental figure . formation of bfa induced _LOCATION_ aggregates in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ cells is stage dependent . supplemental figure . recovery of bfa induced aggregates . supplemental figure . target of bfa effect on _LOCATION_ and pvc is distinct . supplemental figure . ultrastructural analysis of bfa treated transgenic _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ cells .
