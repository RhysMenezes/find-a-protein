chloroplast development requires accurate spatio temporal _PROTEIN_ of _LOCATION_ genes . the regulation of _LOCATION_ genes mediated by _LOCATION_ encoded rna polymerase _PROTEIN_ is rather complex and its related mechanism remains largely unclear . here we report the identification of a novel protein that is essential for plant development _PROTEIN_ related development arrested . knock out of in arabidopsis caused a seedling lethal albino phenotype and arrested the development of leaf chloroplasts . localization analysis showed that was specifically targeted to chloroplasts and co localized with chloroplast nucleoids revealing that is a chloroplast nucleoid associated protein . gene _PROTEIN_ analyses revealed that the _PROTEIN_ dependent _LOCATION_ transcript levels were greatly reduced in . was co _PROTEIN_ with most of the _PROTEIN_ associated proteins . protein interaction assays showed that clearly interacts with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ both of which have been verified as essential for _PROTEIN_ related chloroplast development . reactive oxygen species scavenging through dimethylthiourea markedly alleviated the cotyledon albino phenotypes of and _PROTEIN_ rna interference seedlings . these results demonstrate that is required for early chloroplast development and involved in the regulation of _LOCATION_ gene _PROTEIN_ .
as a supplementation to the previous high throughput rnai plant library used in our study of _PROTEIN_ a number of target off function unknown genes the products of which have been predicted to be targeted to chloroplasts and the _PROTEIN_ profiles of which have been associated with the seedling development stage were sorted and their respective arabidopsis rnai lines were separately constructed . fortunately rnai silencing of one such target gene in arabidopsis resulted in the typical delayed greening seedling phenotypes similar to the results obtained with _PROTEIN_ . approximately four fifths of the rnai transformants exhibited consistent delayed greening phenotypes i.e . two cotyledons were nearly albino after seed germination and gradually greened at weeks old . the arabidopsis locus id of the corresponding gene is _PROTEIN_ and we named this gene _PROTEIN_ related development arrested . reverse transcription pcr analysis confirmed the severe interference with transcription in these rnai plants . was annotated in public databases as encoding an unknown chloroplast protein . this gene contains nine exons and eight introns and is located on chromosome . the open reading frame of encodes a polypeptide of amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of approximately kda . no conserved functional domains were predicted in the sequence through any available bioinformatics tools . blast searching the arabidopsis genome revealed only one copy of the gene in arabidopsis and no paralogs were identified . sequence alignment analysis revealed that orthologs existed in nearly all known photosynthetic _METHOD_ from lower green algae to various higher plants . and its homologs share high similarity in a region of approximately amino acids in the c terminus . to investigate the evolutionary relationship among proteins a phylogenetic tree was constructed . as shown in fig . the proteins are well differentiated and exhibit a clear evolutionary linkage from lower green algae to _METHOD_ . proteins from algae and mosses form a subclade . the proteins from _METHOD_ form a large subclade in which those from monocots and dicots are clearly divided . these data indicated that is likely to be a conserved protein in photoautotrophic _METHOD_ . to acquire further functional information on a t dna insertion line with an obvious albino phenotype was obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center _PROTEIN_ and designated as . genetic analysis showed that controlled this mutant phenotype in a recessive manner and co segregated with the kanamycin resistance marker . sequencing of the t dna border junction showed that the t dna was inserted into the first intron of . a pcr genotyping analysis of the plants developed from heterozygous plant seeds showed that the segregation rate of green vs. albino plants was nearly indicating that was a single t dna insertion mutant . an rt pcr analysis indicated that the transcription of was completely lost in . no transcripts were found in using quantitative real time pcr . the homozygous plants exhibited albino cotyledons without true primary leaves upon germination and survived no longer than weeks when grown in soil or on murashige and skoog _METHOD_ medium under standard conditions in a growth chamber indicating that the plants were unable to grow photoautotrophically . nevertheless on _METHOD_ medium supplemented with sucrose as a _PROTEIN_ source the plants continuously grew and produced pale yellow true leaves but whole plant development was greatly retarded compared with wild type plants similar to the phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . the results of this phenotypic characterization demonstrated that plays an essential role in plant autotrophic growth . thus the mutant was subjected to further detailed analysis to elucidate the molecular function of . the full length orf driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter was introduced into heterozygous plants to perform complementation experiments . the successfully complemented plants with a homozygous mutant background were identified through pcr genotyping and the _PROTEIN_ of the transgenic orf was verified through rt pcr analysis . the complemented plants grew normally and exhibited a wild type like phenotype indicating that solely the disruption of contributed to the seedling lethal phenotype of . in addition overexpression in a col background was also generated but these plants were visually indistinguishable from wild type plants suggesting that the overexpression of in arabidopsis did not affect plant growth . to obtain more information associated with the molecular function of we investigated the tissue specific _PROTEIN_ of in arabidopsis . the transcript levels of were evaluated in almost all tissues using both rt pcr and qpcr analyses . the results showed that transcripts were highly _PROTEIN_ in young leaves shoots and flowers but the _PROTEIN_ was nearly absent in the roots and minimally detected in _METHOD_ and siliques . the _PROTEIN_ profile is consistent with the data from genevestigator . these results indicated that _PROTEIN_ corresponds well to the plant developmental stage and potentially corresponds to the stage of _LOCATION_ differentiation and leaf chloroplast development . chloroplast differentiation and development are markedly induced and regulated by light . to determine the influence of light on _PROTEIN_ we examined the accumulation of transcripts during the light induced greening of arabidopsis etiolated seedlings . a semi quantitative rt pcr analysis of corresponding samples showed that transcription _PROTEIN_ a low level of _PROTEIN_ in etiolated seedlings which gradually increased after light exposure reaching a maximal stable level after approximately h suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is required for light induced chloroplast development . both the phenotypic characterization of mutants and the _PROTEIN_ profile of suggested that might function in chloroplast development . to test this supposition the chloroplast morphological structure in leaves was examined through transmission electron microscopy . as shown in fig . the leaf chloroplasts of plants grown on sucrose supplemented _METHOD_ medium under normal conditions were severely shrunken with abnormal shapes compared with the wild type controls and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ structures were absent indicative of deficient development and differentiation . moreover the shuttle shaped starch granules in wild type chloroplasts disappeared in chloroplasts suggesting that photosynthetic activity was impaired in plants . no obvious changes in other organelles and the _LOCATION_ were observed in leaves . these observations suggested that has essential function associated with early chloroplast development . is annotated in various public databases as encoding a chloroplast localized protein and is predicted in chlorop to possess an obvious chloroplast transit peptide . to verify these hypotheses a chimeric gene _PROTEIN_ and the yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion protein under the promoter _METHOD_ was constructed . the construct was introduced into nicotiana benthamiana leaves and the _METHOD_ was examined through confocal laser scanning microscopy . free _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was used as a control . as shown in fig . the yellow _METHOD_ of free _METHOD_ was distributed in regions close to the cell _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ . in contrast the yellow _METHOD_ of the _METHOD_ fusion protein overlapped well with the red chl _METHOD_ indicating that is specifically targeted to chloroplasts . the _METHOD_ yellow _METHOD_ exhibited a clear punctate distribution pattern similar to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ all of which have been previously identified as chloroplast nucleoid localized proteins suggesting that is also a chloroplast nucleoid localized protein . to confirm these results two pairs of co localization experiments were performed in which pend and _PROTEIN_ were used as two nucleoid localized control proteins . the results showed that the _METHOD_ signals from both _METHOD_ enhanced cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ merged well with nucleoids in leaf chloroplasts indicating that is finely localized to chloroplast nucleoids . initially we used web based analyses to predict the molecular function of . the co _PROTEIN_ data from _PROTEIN_ ii showed that is co _PROTEIN_ with genes related to chloroplast development of which _PROTEIN_ trxz _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have been identified as essential for the regulation of _PROTEIN_ dependent _LOCATION_ gene _PROTEIN_ . these findings implied that is potentially involved in the regulation of _LOCATION_ gene _PROTEIN_ . to examine this hypothesis further the transcript levels of _LOCATION_ genes were investigated in knock out mutants . eight genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were chosen as _PROTEIN_ dependent genes six genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were chosen as nep dependent genes and six genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were selected to represent both _PROTEIN_ and nep dependent genes . in addition the transcript levels of certain _LOCATION_ encoded genes encoding chloroplast proteins were also examined . the seedling lethal albino and chloroplast development arrested mutant was also used as a control . the mutant is a single t dna insertion mutant of magnesium chelatase _PROTEIN_ the transcripts of which were absent in . this mutant could be completely complemented through the ectopic _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ orf . as shown in fig . the analysis of _LOCATION_ gene _PROTEIN_ revealed that the transcript levels of all eight _PROTEIN_ dependent genes were significantly _PROTEIN_ in while the transcript levels of all six nep dependent genes were markedly increased . for the representative class ii genes only the transcript level of was _PROTEIN_ while the transcript levels of the other five genes were obviously increased . however the transcript accumulation of all investigated _LOCATION_ genes in salk _PROTEIN_ nearly the same levels as observed in wild type plants . the transcript accumulation of the genes encoding photosynthesis related proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was not affected in both and _PROTEIN_ mutants . the transcript accumulation of _LOCATION_ genes in showed high similarity to that in previously characterized _PROTEIN_ deficient mutants such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ trxz and _PROTEIN_ plants . these results indicated that _LOCATION_ gene _PROTEIN_ was severely disturbed in arabidopsis through knock out and is essentially required for the regulation of _PROTEIN_ dependent _LOCATION_ gene _PROTEIN_ . interestingly as shown above was co _PROTEIN_ with many _LOCATION_ encoded _PROTEIN_ essential subunits e.g . trxz _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ based on the results of the public co _PROTEIN_ analysis . in addition both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were also found to be co _PROTEIN_ with . these results suggested that might functionally associate with the _PROTEIN_ polymeric complex through interactions with certain _PROTEIN_ components . to assess the putative association between and _PROTEIN_ protein protein interaction assays were performed between and the co _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ using bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation . here the _PROTEIN_ include all the _LOCATION_ encoded _PROTEIN_ essential subunits and three other proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the orfs of and the _PROTEIN_ were fused to the c and n terminal moieties of _METHOD_ respectively to generate _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs respectively . each control combination _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ produced no _METHOD_ . in contrast strong punctate yellow _METHOD_ signals merging well with the red chl _METHOD_ were observed only from the combination of both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ indicative of the formation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ complexes in chloroplast nucleoids . as _PROTEIN_ has been identified as an interaction partner of the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and the above _PROTEIN_ was also analyzed . we observed that _PROTEIN_ similarly to clearly interacts with _PROTEIN_ but not with other _PROTEIN_ . these interactions were further validated through firefly luciferase complementation imaging assays . the _PROTEIN_ essential subunit _PROTEIN_ is a chloroplast stroma localized iron superoxide dismutase which interacts with the chloroplast nucleoid localized _PROTEIN_ and together these proteins act as ros scavengers to protect chloroplast nucleoids . the possible interaction of both and _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ suggested that and _PROTEIN_ probably act as components of the _PROTEIN_ complex and might be involved in the redox control of _LOCATION_ gene _PROTEIN_ . the interactions identified above suggested that similarly to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ might function in scavenging ros around chloroplast nucleoids . thus we examined whether the deficient plants are sensitive to oxidative stress . to this end we investigated the greening progress of rnai plants mutants and the col control plants growing under high light and low light conditions . as shown in fig . col plants exhibited nearly the same growth under low and high light conditions . in contrast the cotyledons of rnai plants growing under low light conditions typically greened earlier and grew more strongly than those under high light conditions . the mutants growing under low light conditions developed rapidly with more yellowish leaves while those under high light conditions grew slowly with leaves exhibiting ivory phenotypes . these analyses indicated that both the rnai and mutant plants showed light intensity dependent responses consistent with the case of _PROTEIN_ mutants . nitroblue tetrazolium staining and subsequent quantification analyses were performed on d dark acclimated deficient plants and the results showed that the accumulation of in dark acclimated deficient plants was significantly higher than that in wild type control plants but was similar to that in _PROTEIN_ mutants . these results imply that the deficient plants are sensitive to oxidative stress similarly to _PROTEIN_ mutants . moreover and _PROTEIN_ rnai seedlings were subjected to ros related drug treatments . the delayed greening phenotype of these plants is convenient to observe ros induced phenotypic changes . the well known ros scavenger dimethylthiourea was used here . a series of final concentrations of dmtu were added to the _METHOD_ culture to examine plant tolerance against this antioxidant . higher dmtu concentrations of up to mm inhibited seed germination and delayed seedling growth and mm dmtu was chosen to treat both rnai plants . as shown in fig . the phenotypic investigation indicated that the cotyledons of either or _PROTEIN_ rnai plants treated with mm dmtu generally exhibited nearly green phenotypes distinctly different from the yellowish phenotypes of the untreated rnai plants . chl determination assays showed that dmtu treated and _PROTEIN_ rnai seedlings contained higher chl levels than untreated seedlings . these results suggested that ros accumulation in and _PROTEIN_ rnai plants impeded plant greening indicating that is likely to be involved in the _PROTEIN_ of the redox state around chloroplast nucleoids .
