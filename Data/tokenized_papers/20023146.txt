histidine plays a critical role in plant growth and development both as one of the standard amino acids in proteins and as a metal binding ligand . while genes encoding seven of the eight enzymes in the pathway of his biosynthesis have been characterized from a number of plant species the identity of the enzyme catalyzing the dephosphorylation of histidinol phosphate to histidinol has remained elusive . recently members of a novel family of histidinol phosphate phosphatase proteins displaying significant sequence similarity to known myoinositol monophosphatases _PROTEIN_ have been identified from several actinobacteria . here we demonstrate that a member of the _PROTEIN_ family from arabidopsis myoinositol monophosphatase _PROTEIN_ has histidinol phosphate phosphatase activity . heterologous _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ but not the related _PROTEIN_ protein was sufficient to rescue the his auxotrophy of a streptomyces coelicolor hisn mutant . homozygous null _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis mutants displayed embryonic lethality which could be rescued by supplying plants heterozygous for null _PROTEIN_ alleles with his . in common with the previously characterized hisn genes from arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in all plant tissues and throughout development and an _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein fusion protein was targeted to the _LOCATION_ where his biosynthesis occurs in plants . our data demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is the _PROTEIN_ gene product and suggest a lack of genetic redundancy at this metabolic step in arabidopsis which is characteristic of the his biosynthetic pathway .
to identify putative homologs in arabidopsis of the _PROTEIN_ like proteins that catalyze the dephosphorylation of histidinol p in the actinobacteria we carried out blast analysis of the arabidopsis protein refseq database with the s. coelicolor hpp protein . this identified three proteins with approximately sequence identity to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ all members of the _PROTEIN_ superfamily . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have recently been shown to catalyze the dephosphorylation of d ins p d ins p and l gal p . however their ability to utilize histidinol p as a substrate has not been reported . all known plant hisn genes contain n terminal _LOCATION_ transit peptide encoding sequences and it is thought that his biosynthesis is localized to the _LOCATION_ . it is thus highly probable that any hpp enzyme in arabidopsis would also be targeted to this organelle . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ satisfy this criterion . these two proteins contain putative _LOCATION_ transit peptide sequences as predicted by chlorop analysis and have been detected in _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analyses of purified chloroplast preparations from arabidopsis . in contrast _PROTEIN_ does not contain a predicted _LOCATION_ transit peptide and is instead a _LOCATION_ protein hmmtop analysis predicts the presence of three transmembrane helices and _PROTEIN_ has been detected in purified _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ preparations by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis . in contrast to yeast there is little evidence for the operation of a general control of nitrogen metabolism regulatory mechanism in plants . however the genes encoding the first six enzymes in arabidopsis have _PROTEIN_ like binding sites in their upstream regions which may be indicative of transcriptional coregulation . in addition inhibition of _PROTEIN_ activity has been shown to result in increased _PROTEIN_ of histidinol dehydrogenase _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . we used the arabidopsis coexpression data mining tool to identify genes coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ across publicly available affymetrix _PROTEIN_ microarray datasets . this analysis identified two his biosynthetic genes as showing the most positive correlation in _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ profar i _PROTEIN_ ranked first and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ranked fourth . in addition hpa _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was ranked with an r value of . in contrast none of the known hisn genes were returned in the top genes most positively correlated with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . finally analysis of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ amino acid sequences revealed that a gly residue required for hpp activity in the s. coelicolor enzyme was conserved in _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ where it is replaced by glu . on the basis of our bioinformatic analyses we investigated whether _PROTEIN_ encodes a functional hpp enzyme in arabidopsis . as histidinol p is no longer commercially available to test for hpp activity of recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein we instead determined whether heterologous _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was sufficient to complement the his auxotrophy of the s. coelicolor hpp mutant hisn . hisn protoplasts transformed with the empty _PROTEIN_ vector were able to grow on minimal media only if supplemented with g his while transformation with _PROTEIN_ allowed the mutant to grow on minimal media without added his confirming that _PROTEIN_ possesses hpp activity . in contrast heterologous _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was not sufficient to complement the his auxotrophy of the hisn strain suggesting that _PROTEIN_ does not possess hpp activity . a conserved gly residue has previously been shown to be required for hpp activity in s. coelicolor . this residue is present in all putative hpp homologs subsequently identified in the actinobacteria and is also present in _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ . to determine whether gly was required for the hpp activity of _PROTEIN_ we used pcr site directed mutagenesis to generate a mutant protein where this residue was substituted with arg . hisn cells _PROTEIN_ the mutant _PROTEIN_ protein were unable to grow on minimal media without supplementation with g his demonstrating that gly is also required for hpp activity of _PROTEIN_ . a search of the protein data bank for homologs of _PROTEIN_ produces protein structures which according to the criteria of pgenthreader are certain to have similar folds . structural alignment of several of these proteins using the matchmaker tool of ucsf chimera demonstrated that there was considerable conservation of the location of most of the structural elements of the protein family . variability in structure occurred _PROTEIN_ in the loops especially in those residues corresponding to to in _PROTEIN_ . the two structures chosen as models were suhb the inositol monophosphatase and extragenic suppressor from e. coli and the inositol monophosphatase from bos taurus . _PROTEIN_ has sequence identities of and to and respectively . the pgenthreader generated alignment of _PROTEIN_ with these two proteins was slightly modified to ensure that gaps were inserted in the most appropriate loops and used to produce a homology model using modeller . the molecule has a layered structure and a pronounced active site cleft in which are situated three ions held in position by _PROTEIN_ groups of glu and asp residues located on loops at the side of the six stranded sheet and on one of the central helices . gly is located in the third strand of the six stranded sheet and is in close contact with one of the central helices . the location of this helix determines the position of asp which _METHOD_ a salt bridge to one of the active site ions . gly is strongly conserved in the _PROTEIN_ superfamily and the only other residue tolerated at this position is ala which is found in . replacement of gly with an arg using resulted in severe clashes with pro . since searches for an optimum packing of side chains without moving the protein backbone we conclude that it is impossible to accommodate an arg residue at this position without separating the strand and the helix by at least . such a separation would alter the relative locations of the key active site residues asp glu asp and asp . the latter three amino acids are located on other strands in the sheet . this in turn would disrupt the active site and account for the observed inactivity of the mutant _PROTEIN_ protein . homozygosity for null alleles of any of the four nonredundant genes in the his biosynthetic pathway results in embryonic lethality in arabidopsis . if _PROTEIN_ was the only protein with hpp activity in arabidopsis this phenotype should also be observed in _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion lines . two t dna insertion lines were obtained from the european arabidopsis stock centre _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were supplied as segregating lines and pcr genotyping of plants failed to identify a single homozygous individual in either line consistent with homozygous lethality for null mutations in _PROTEIN_ . instead analysis revealed no significant difference from a ratio of two heterozygous to one wild type plant in either line . tests were used to determine whether the ratio of heterozygous to wild type individuals was significantly different from . to determine the developmental stage at which lethality occurs we examined the siliques of heterozygous plants following self pollination . approximately a quarter of the seeds in these siliques were observed to have aborted prior to the _PROTEIN_ globular stage of development in both the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ insertion lines . thus lethality of the null _PROTEIN_ mutants occurred during embryo development as previously reported for other single copy hisn genes . in contrast to several of the nonredundant hisn genes analyzed by citation analysis revealed no significant difference from a ratio of three wild type to one mutant seed and thus no evidence of reduced transmission of _PROTEIN_ mutant pollen tubes . het heterozygote wt wild type . the supply of exogenous his to heterozygous plants can partially rescue the embryonic lethality of null hisn mutant seeds . to determine whether his supplementation could rescue the embryonic lethality phenotype in the _PROTEIN_ mutants we first identified heterozygous plants by pcr and determined the frequency of seed abortion in siliques from the primary bolt . the primary bolt was then removed and the plants supplied with mm his daily . application of his resulted in a reduced frequency of seed abortion in the secondary bolts from to in _PROTEIN_ and to in _PROTEIN_ . no such _PROTEIN_ was observed in plants supplied only with water . in an alternative experimental approach mm his was supplied to heterozygous plants identified by pcr prior to bolting and siliques from the primary bolt analyzed d after feeding began . the percentage of aborted seeds in siliques from plants supplied with his was significantly lower than that of control plants and the majority of these plants contained several siliques with no aborted seeds . together these data suggest that the embryonic lethality phenotype of _PROTEIN_ null mutants is a consequence of their inability to synthesize his and that there is no apparent genetic redundancy in the capacity for histidinol biosynthesis in arabidopsis at least in the developing embryo . rna gel blot and microarray analyses of known hisn genes from arabidopsis has demonstrated that they are constitutively _PROTEIN_ in all plant tissues and at all developmental stages . we analyzed the temporal and spatial _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ across multiple microarray _PROTEIN_ profiling experiments using genevestigator . _PROTEIN_ displayed a similar pattern of _PROTEIN_ to other known hisn genes _PROTEIN_ transcripts were detected in all tissues and throughout development and mrna levels were lowest in pollen as previously reported for all other hisn genes by citation . all of the his biosynthetic enzymes identified to date from plants contain a putative n terminal _LOCATION_ transit peptide and two proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ have been immunolocalized to this organelle . to demonstrate conclusively that the arabidopsis hpp _PROTEIN_ is also targeted to the _LOCATION_ in planta we generated two c terminal _METHOD_ fusion proteins the first a full length _PROTEIN_ protein fused to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the second a truncated _PROTEIN_ lacking the first amino acids predicted to act as the _LOCATION_ transit peptide by chlorop fused to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . confocal imaging of maize leaf protoplasts transiently _PROTEIN_ these proteins revealed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was targeted to the chloroplast as evidenced by the colocalization of _METHOD_ signal and chlorophyll autofluoresence . in contrast the truncated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein remained in the cytoplasm . thus the amino acid n terminal sequence serves as a functional _LOCATION_ transit peptide and is required for transport into the chloroplast . querying the national center for biotechnology information mrna refseq database with the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cdna sequences identified putative homologs of each gene in a range of monocot and dicot plants for which full genome sequence is available as well as in the chlorophyte green alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii . phylogenetic analysis of the aligned _PROTEIN_ cdna sequences using the neighbor joining method _PROTEIN_ revealed the existence of three well supported clades with the orthologs from the various species showing greater sequence similarity than paralogs within the same species . the phylogenetic tree is consistent with the occurrence of two gene duplication events with subsequent sequence divergence the first duplication event giving rise to the _PROTEIN_ clade and the second to the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ clades . these gene duplication events apparently occurred prior to the divergence of the plant and green algal lineages from their last common ancestor which has been dated at million years ago .
plants were grown on a mix of peat and vermiculite in a controlled environment room with a photosynthetic flux of to mol under a h h dark cycle at and relative humidity . plants were fertilized with phostrogen plant food and d postgermination . two segregating t dna insertion knockout lines for _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were obtained from the european arabidopsis stock centre . plants were genotyped using gene specific primers in combination with the primer for _PROTEIN_ or the primer _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ . gene specific primers were as follows _PROTEIN_ left and right _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ left _PROTEIN_ and right _PROTEIN_ . two pcr reactions were set up for each dna sample one with the gene specific left and right primers and a second with the left border primer and right primer both at an annealing temperature of and an extension time of min . the exact position of the t dna insertions in these lines was determined by dna sequencing of the pcr product generated using the left border and right primers and was found to lie at the boundary of exon i _PROTEIN_ and boundary of exon ii _PROTEIN_ respectively . the analysis of siliques for the presence of aborted seeds in heterozygous individuals was carried out as described in the tutorial section of the seed genes project web site . rescue experiments were carried out by supplying mm his daily to the roots of heterozygous plants prior to bolting . siliques were analyzed to d after supplementation with his began . following an initial round of pcr site directed mutagenesis to remove an internal ndei site the _PROTEIN_ open reading frame _LOCATION_ was amplified by pcr using the primers _PROTEIN_ f and _PROTEIN_ r _PROTEIN_ and cloned into the conjugative and integrative _PROTEIN_ vector via the xbai and ndei sites in the multiple cloning site . a second construct containing the _PROTEIN_ orf _LOCATION_ with a gly to arg substitution was also generated by pcr site directed mutagenesis . two overlapping pcr products were amplified using _PROTEIN_ f in combination with arg r and _PROTEIN_ r with arg f . the resulting products were used as the template in a second round of pcr with the _PROTEIN_ f and _PROTEIN_ r primers and the bp pcr product cloned into via the xbai and ndei sites . the _PROTEIN_ orf _LOCATION_ was amplified by pcr using the primers gccatatgctgtctgaggtttctgatcag and gcggatccttaaagctctgtatgataatc and cloned into via the bamhi and ndei sites in the multiple cloning site . the vectors were transformed into the methylation deficient escherichia coli strain containing that supplies transacting functions for the mobilization of ori t containing plasmids and introduced into streptomyces coelicolor strains by conjugation according to citation . the s. coelicolor strains used in this study were wild type and the hpp mutant _PROTEIN_ that requires supplementation with g his and g phe for growth on minimal media . the full length _PROTEIN_ orf was amplified by pcr using the primers _METHOD_ f _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ r _PROTEIN_ and the orf minus putative _LOCATION_ transit peptide sequence _PROTEIN_ with the primers _METHOD_ ctp _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ r. the amplified sequences were cloned into the gateway vector via the sali and noti sites and then recombined into binary _PROTEIN_ destination vector . protoplasts were isolated from g of leaf tissue from maize plants grown under standard growth conditions for d followed by d in continuous darkness according to the protocol of citation . polyethylene glycol calcium mediated transfection of protoplasts with g of plasmid dna was carried out as described by citation . imaging was carried out using a zeiss lsm meta confocal microscope with an _PROTEIN_ c apochromat w objective . _METHOD_ was excited at nm and emission detected in the to nm range . chlorophyll autoflouresence was detected in the to nm range . homologs to _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ were found in the

ensure that insertions and deletions were appropriately placed in the loops connecting the secondary structural elements . side chains were placed using . molecular graphics images were produced using
