arabidopsis tryptophan proline proline domain proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are plant unique _LOCATION_ envelope associated proteins of unknown function . they have sequence similarity to the _LOCATION_ envelope targeting domain of plant _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ activating protein of the small _PROTEIN_ ran . wpp domain interacting tail anchored protein _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are two arabidopsis proteins containing a coiled coil domain and a c terminal predicted transmembrane domain . they are required for _PROTEIN_ association with the _LOCATION_ envelope in root tips . here we show that _PROTEIN_ also binds _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in planta we identify the chaperone heat shock cognate protein _PROTEIN_ as in vivo interaction partner of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and we show that _PROTEIN_ interacts in planta with _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ are targeted to the _LOCATION_ envelope in arabidopsis . in contrast _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ large cytoplasmic aggregates when overexpressed transiently in nicotiana benthamiana leaf epidermis cells . coexpression of _PROTEIN_ significantly reduces _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ aggregation and permits association of most _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with the _LOCATION_ envelope . significantly _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ show the same activity . a _PROTEIN_ mutant with reduced affinity for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fails to _PROTEIN_ its aggregation . while the wpp domain proteins act on a region of _PROTEIN_ containing the coiled coil domain _PROTEIN_ additionally acts on the c terminal transmembrane domain . taken together our data suggest that both _PROTEIN_ and the wpp domain proteins play a role in facilitating _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ envelope targeting which is to our knowledge the first described in planta activity for the wpp domain proteins .
to identify proteins interacting with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis transgenic plants were made that _PROTEIN_ either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ fused to a tandem affinity purification tag . after tandem affinity purification _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and silver staining the excised bands were subjected to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis . five peptides corresponding to arabidopsis _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ were identified in an kd band of the tap _PROTEIN_ pull down fraction . similarly four peptides belonging to the same _PROTEIN_ group of proteins coming from an kd band of the tap _PROTEIN_ pull down fraction were recognized . the arabidopsis genome encodes five different _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ genes three of which are _PROTEIN_ constitutively _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . sequences of several identified peptides do not allow identification of a specific _PROTEIN_ due to a high sequence similarity among different family members . however some of the peptides unequivocally identified _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . to confirm the interactions between _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the corresponding cdnas were cloned and ha tagged proteins were coexpressed with _METHOD_ tagged proteins by agroinfiltration in n. benthamiana . figure shows that _PROTEIN_ bound both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ while _PROTEIN_ bound _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ in this assay . two coiled coil proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ had been previously identified as in vivo _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interactors from the same tandem affinity purification fractions . figure shows that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interactions occur after agroinfiltration in n. benthamiana . interactions between wpp domain proteins and endogenous _PROTEIN_ or endogenous _PROTEIN_ were subsequently tested in transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ either _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the control of their own promoters . in these lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are associated with the ne _LOCATION_ like speckles and a meshwork like structure that most likely represents _LOCATION_ similar to the published driven fusions . figure shows that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ coimmunoprecitipate endogenous _PROTEIN_ and endogenous _PROTEIN_ . although the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody recognizes all _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ this pool consists mostly of the constitutively _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ thus likely representing the _METHOD_ coimmunoprecipitated by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in agreement with the role in anchoring _PROTEIN_ to the ne both endogenous _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ are targeted to the ne in arabidopsis . however the attempts to localize _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ driven by the promoter in different transient transformation _METHOD_ repeatedly showed that overexpressed _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ large aggregate like _METHOD_ bodies in the cytoplasm . the aggregates occurred when _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts derived from an n. benthamiana cell culture or from arabidopsis leaf mesophyll cells and in agroinfiltrated n. benthamiana leaves when the strong silencing suppressor was coinfiltrated . no obvious underlying structure such as _LOCATION_ whorls could be observed within the aggregates at the level of resolution of confocal microscopy . in the absence of association of _PROTEIN_ with the ne could be detected indicating that the aggregates were based on the high level of protein _PROTEIN_ in the presence of . consistently when the _PROTEIN_ level of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ the of the infiltrated agrobacterium tumefaciens culture to one fifth or one tenth of the value used for other experiments the overall weaker _PROTEIN_ signal was now also found associated with the ne . to further define the nature of the _PROTEIN_ aggregates colocalization experiments with a marker that labels the _LOCATION_ were performed . _PROTEIN_ aggregates clearly colocalized with the _LOCATION_ marker . the _LOCATION_ marker by itself did not show any aggregate formation as described previously . in some cells _PROTEIN_ and the _LOCATION_ marker colocalized in a meshwork like pattern indicative of _LOCATION_ . this suggests that aggregates consist at least in part of _PROTEIN_ associated _LOCATION_ material . studies in animals suggest that _LOCATION_ insertion of some ta proteins with very hydrophobic tmds is assisted by chaperones without which they form insoluble aggregates . the _PROTEIN_ chaperone complex was identified as one of the two _PROTEIN_ dependent complexes that interact with mammalian ta protein substrates in vitro and assist in their delivery . because _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ had both been found in an in vivo complex with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we tested whether arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ would prevent the cytoplasmic aggregation of _PROTEIN_ . since wpp domain proteins interact with both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we also tested their effect on _PROTEIN_ localization . ha tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and wpp domain proteins were coexpressed one by one with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana . coagroinfiltration of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ led to a significantly reduced number of _PROTEIN_ aggregates compared with gus coexpression . in addition the association of _PROTEIN_ with the ne could be detected when _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ were coexpressed . the percentage of cells that contained aggregates _PROTEIN_ from about in case of gus coexpression to and for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ coexpression respectively . in contrast coexpression of _PROTEIN_ did not _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ aggregation . immunoblot analysis showed that all ha tagged proteins were _PROTEIN_ and that the level of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was comparable in all samples . importantly it was highest in the sample coexpressing _PROTEIN_ indicating that the reduced number of _PROTEIN_ aggregates observed for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ coexpression is not simply based on lower _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels . cells showing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ aggregation were viable either when _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was present alone or in combination with ha gus or ha _PROTEIN_ judged by the staining of cell walls only with propidium iodide . to test if the different effects of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ on the aggregates correlate with their ability to bind _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ samples from the coinfiltrated leaves were subjected to coimmunoprecipitation . figure shows that when similar amounts of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were immunoprecipitated with the anti ha antibody significantly more _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was detected in the precipitates with _PROTEIN_ than with _PROTEIN_ . no signal was detected from leaves coexpressing free _METHOD_ . this result suggests higher stability of the complex containing _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ than the one containing _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ consistent with the observed effect on the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ aggregates . to also test the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with endogenous _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis a coimmunoprecipitation using transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of the promoter was performed . as a control a transgenic plant _PROTEIN_ driven _METHOD_ was used . unlike _METHOD_ which did not coimmunoprecipitate any _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ bound significant amounts of endogenous _PROTEIN_ . the conserved amino acid motif wpp in the wpp domain of _PROTEIN_ is critical for _PROTEIN_ binding to _PROTEIN_ . the wpp domains of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ show high sequence similarity and share the conserved wpp motif . a wpp to aap mutation was introduced into _PROTEIN_ and the effect on the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ aggregates was tested in n. benthamiana . while _PROTEIN_ largely prevented formation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ aggregates _PROTEIN_ failed to reduce _PROTEIN_ aggregates when the two proteins were coexpressed . the percentage of cells that contained aggregates when _PROTEIN_ was coinfiltrated was compared to in the case of the wild type protein and based on three independent experiments . consistently the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was largely reduced . we conclude that the effect of _PROTEIN_ on the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ aggregates is specific and depends on the ability of two proteins to interact . to test whether amino acids to of _PROTEIN_ containing the coiled coil domain but lacking the tmd would also form aggregates _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana . when coexpressed alone or with the unrelated ha gus construct _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ formed aggregates in the majority of cells . these aggregates differed from those formed by _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in that they did not cause the _LOCATION_ marker to coaggregate consistent with the absence of a tmd on this construct . nevertheless coinfiltrated _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ also significantly reduced the number of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ aggregates . immunoblot analysis confirmed that all three ha tagged proteins were _PROTEIN_ . the level of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was only slightly reduced when _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ was present compared to gus coexpression . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ reduced the number of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ aggregates to a similar degree . immunoprecipitation with the anti ha antibody showed that both ha _PROTEIN_ and ha _PROTEIN_ coimmunoprecipitated _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ equally well indicating that both proteins bind to _PROTEIN_ in the absence of the c terminal predicted tmd . based on our data with other wpp interacting coiled coil proteins binding between _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ most likely depends on the coiled coil domain . this suggests that at least in case of the wpp domain proteins the aggregates are prevented by association of a wpp domain protein with the long coiled coil domain of _PROTEIN_ . interestingly while _PROTEIN_ prevented aggregate formation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ the number of cells with proper ne targeting of this construct was not increased indicating that in n. benthamiana a _PROTEIN_ that is required for ne targeting of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ might be missing at least under the condition where both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are overexpressed . in contrast ha _PROTEIN_ coinfiltration not only reduced the number of aggregates but also increased the number of cells showing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ at the ne suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is involved in an additional step required for ne targeting in this background . when _PROTEIN_ alone or with the gus construct in n. benthamiana _METHOD_ containing the very c terminal amino acids of _PROTEIN_ including the putative tmd formed aggregates too however of a different shape . the aggregates were smaller typically roundish and sometimes appeared hollow . they were labeled by the _LOCATION_ marker suggesting an _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ nature of the structures . coexpression of _PROTEIN_ caused a _PROTEIN_ in the number of aggregates while _PROTEIN_ had no significant effect . immunoblot analysis showed that all three ha tagged proteins were _PROTEIN_ and that the _PROTEIN_ level of _METHOD_ was comparable in all three samples . this suggests that while _PROTEIN_ also acts somewhat to prevent aggregate formation of the _PROTEIN_ c terminus _PROTEIN_ requires a domain within _PROTEIN_ for its activity . since we have shown that _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ we asked if the three proteins are in the same complex . therefore ha _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were coinfiltrated in n. benthamiana and as a control _METHOD_ was coexpressed with ha _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . samples were first immunoprecipitated with the anti ha antibody . ha _PROTEIN_ bound both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but not _METHOD_ . then anti ha immunoprecipitated complexes were subjected to a second immunoprecipitation with the anti _METHOD_ antibody . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was only detected in the sample that contained _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . these data show that _PROTEIN_ is simultaneously associated with both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and suggests that this ternary complex might be active in preventing the aggregates of _PROTEIN_ .
