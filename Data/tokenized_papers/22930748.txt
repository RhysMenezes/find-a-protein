primary aerial surfaces of land plants are coated by a lipidic cuticle which _METHOD_ a barrier against transpirational water loss and protects the plant from diverse stresses . four enzymes of a fatty acid elongase complex are required for the synthesis of very long chain fatty acid precursors of cuticular waxes . fatty acid elongase substrate specificity is determined by a condensing enzyme that catalyzes the first reaction carried out by the complex . in arabidopsis characterized condensing enzymes involved in wax synthesis can only elongate vlcfas up to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in length despite the predominance of _PROTEIN_ to monomers in arabidopsis stem wax . this suggests additional proteins are required for elongation beyond _PROTEIN_ . the wax deficient mutant _PROTEIN_ lacks waxes longer than _PROTEIN_ implying that _PROTEIN_ a putative bahd acyltransferase is required for _PROTEIN_ elongation . here we characterize the _PROTEIN_ mutant and demonstrate that green _METHOD_ protein tagged _PROTEIN_ localizes to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ the site of vlcfa biosynthesis . we use site directed mutagenesis to show that the classification of _PROTEIN_ as a bahd acyltransferase based on sequence homology does not fit with _PROTEIN_ catalytic activity . finally we provide evidence for the function of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ elongation by an assay in yeast .
previous studies have established both wax load and wax composition phenotypes for _PROTEIN_ using transfer dna mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in wassilewskija and ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenized lines _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in landsberg _LOCATION_ . all of these mutant alleles have glossy green _METHOD_ and observation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ by scanning electron microscopy _PROTEIN_ revealed an absence of epicuticular wax crystals . gas chromatography with flame ionization detection analysis of cuticular wax load and composition of the _PROTEIN_ mutant revealed a _PROTEIN_ in total wax load reduction of all wax monomers longer than _PROTEIN_ to trace amounts and increased load of most wax monomers _PROTEIN_ or shorter . a summary of characterized _PROTEIN_ alleles is shown in supplemental table . for our further investigations into _PROTEIN_ function we acquired a t dna insertional mutant line in col ecotype from the arabidopsis biological resource center hereafter referred to as _PROTEIN_ . homozygous mutants were identified by pcr based genotyping and direct sequencing of genomic dna revealed a t dna insertion in the second exon of the _PROTEIN_ gene . _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ individuals had a glossy appearance characteristic of eceriferum mutants with _PROTEIN_ wax load . we further investigated this phenotype using _PROTEIN_ whereas _METHOD_ of wild type col plants are densely coated with rod shaped tubular and platelet shaped wax crystals _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ appear completely devoid of such structures . we analyzed stem waxes by gc fid to determine how wax load and composition of the _PROTEIN_ mutant compared with that of the wild type and other previously described _PROTEIN_ alleles . we detected a reduction in total wax load . all wax monomers longer than _PROTEIN_ were reduced to trace amounts in the mutant and relative increases were observed for several wax monomers shorter than _PROTEIN_ . these results suggest a block in acyl chain elongation past _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ . we also examined the wax profile of rosette leaves in the _PROTEIN_ mutant no change in rosette leaf wax composition or load compared with the wild type was detected . these results agree with the published data for other _PROTEIN_ alleles . based on the wax phenotype of _PROTEIN_ mutant alleles we hypothesized that _PROTEIN_ has a role in fatty acid elongation of wax precursors . given that the four characterized enzymes of the fae complex are localized to the _LOCATION_ we predicted that the _PROTEIN_ gene product should localize to the _LOCATION_ as well . to determine if this is indeed the case the genomic _PROTEIN_ sequence was fused to _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ downstream of the promoter in _PROTEIN_ and wild type arabidopsis . multiple _PROTEIN_ transgenic individuals were recovered which displayed complementation of the _PROTEIN_ wax deficient phenotype _METHOD_ . in both genetic backgrounds _METHOD_ _METHOD_ strongly labeled a reticulate structure in young wax producing stem epidermal cells . when plant _METHOD_ were stained with the _LOCATION_ dye hexyl rhodamine b the stain and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ showed clear colocalization . we also observed an inconsistent _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal in _LOCATION_ in some cells in addition to the strong and highly consistent signal from the _LOCATION_ . _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ supports a role for _PROTEIN_ in wax biosynthesis . organ specific _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ were investigated by quantitative pcr . we detected _PROTEIN_ transcript in all tissues except roots suggesting either that _PROTEIN_ may contribute to wax biosynthesis in organs other than stem or that it may be involved in other metabolic pathways that require vlcfas . to determine tissue and cell type specific _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ we examined _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants transformed with a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene driven by the native _PROTEIN_ promoter which complemented the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype . in _METHOD_ siliques rosette leaves and cauline leaves _METHOD_ was detected uniquely in epidermal cells . these results support the notion that _PROTEIN_ function is specific to cuticular lipid synthesis which occurs exclusively in the epidermis and is similar to previous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ patterns reported by citation citation . we also observed that whereas _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was very strong at the stem apex there was a reduction in _METHOD_ at a distance of only cm from the apex . this observation corroborates previous findings that wax biosynthesis occurs predominantly at the shoot tip . the _PROTEIN_ mutation was previously mapped to _GENE_ which was annotated to encode a bahd acyltransferase on the basis of sequence similarity with members of this gene family . the bahd family is specific to and widely distributed among plants and characterized members have been associated with a broad range of metabolic pathways . we carried out a phylogenetic analysis using the _PROTEIN_ protein sequence its three closest arabidopsis homologs and all of the characterized bahd acyltransferases from arabidopsis that we are aware of . we found that _PROTEIN_ was distantly related to most of the other proteins included in our analysis particularly those with demonstrated acyltransferase activity . two hypothetical proteins that appeared the most closely related to _PROTEIN_ were named _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . bahd acyltransferases catalyze the transfer of an acyl group from acyl coa to either an alcohol or an amine acceptor molecule . multiple studies have demonstrated through structural analysis and site directed mutagenesis that bahd acyltransferase activity and indeed that of several other acyltransferase families is dependent on a catalytic his residue within a conserved hxxxd site . the his residue is singly responsible for deprotonating the alcohol or amine of the acyl acceptor this deprotonation creates a nucleophile that attacks the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of the acyl coa resulting in release of the coa group and formation of a new ester or amide bond . whereas the conserved hxxxd site is present in the _PROTEIN_ sequence we noted that the catalytic his residue is replaced by an asn residue in the putative arabidopsis protein with highest homology to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . because of this peculiarity we undertook an investigation into the function of this _PROTEIN_ paralog . we obtained a t dna insertional mutant of _PROTEIN_ from the arabidopsis biological resource center hereafter referred to as _PROTEIN_ . homozygous mutants were identified by pcr based genotyping and direct sequencing of genomic dna revealed a t dna insertion in the single intron of _PROTEIN_ . publicly available microarray data on the arabidopsis _METHOD_ browser indicate that _PROTEIN_ is highly _PROTEIN_ in leaves . as arabidopsis leaves carry roughly fold less wax than arabidopsis _METHOD_ wax crystals do not form and it is difficult to detect any change in wax load by sight or with _PROTEIN_ . because there was no obvious mutant phenotype indicating that _PROTEIN_ is a loss of function allele we first quantified _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in various wild type tissues and confirmed that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in leaves with lower levels of _PROTEIN_ in siliques and seedlings . we then compared _PROTEIN_ transcript levels between rosette leaves of the wild type and _PROTEIN_ using semiquantitative reverse transcription pcr . we could not detect any transcript in the mutant indicating that _PROTEIN_ is a loss of function allele suitable for further analysis . to determine if _PROTEIN_ plays a role in leaf wax synthesis we analyzed wax composition of _PROTEIN_ and wild type rosette leaves . we found that _PROTEIN_ leaves had a reduction in alkane and accumulated more _PROTEIN_ alkane than the wild type . changes in chain length distribution of less abundant waxes such as aldehydes alcohols and fatty acids were less obvious . the shift in alkane chain length distribution does however suggest a function for _PROTEIN_ in vlcfa elongation to parallel to the role of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ elongation to . the _PROTEIN_ mutant does still accumulate aldehyde alkane and a reduced amount of alkane which implies that there may be genetic redundancy for the to elongation step . because _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are all _PROTEIN_ in rosette leaves we suspect that several or all of these genes have a role in elongating to vlcfas . thus the remaining and waxes in the _PROTEIN_ mutant may be produced by either or both _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ activity . the _PROTEIN_ that the _PROTEIN_ mutant had no rosette leaf wax phenotype despite _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in rosette leaves suggests that _PROTEIN_ is not the only protein with a function in vlcfa elongation from _PROTEIN_ to . thus there may be functional overlap among _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with respect to both _PROTEIN_ to and to elongation in rosette leaves . conversely the _PROTEIN_ phenotype is obvious in _METHOD_ because it is the only gene from this group that is _PROTEIN_ in the stem epidermis . to explore the possibility of functional redundancy between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we generated a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant and analyzed rosette leaf wax composition . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ rosette leaf wax showed substantial accumulation of _PROTEIN_ primary alcohol and _PROTEIN_ alkane showed reduction in alkane and unlike the _PROTEIN_ single mutant did not accumulate _PROTEIN_ alkane . overall we interpreted this result as an accumulation of leaf cuticular waxes _PROTEIN_ and shorter and a reduction in waxes longer than _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ that the reduction in leaf wax elongation occurred at _PROTEIN_ in the double mutant suggests that _PROTEIN_ similar to _PROTEIN_ can elongate _PROTEIN_ to . however the double mutant produced wild type levels of some and wax monomers indicating that the block in elongation in the double mutant is incomplete . we suggest that the second paralog of _PROTEIN_ we identified _PROTEIN_ may be involved in vlcfa elongation in leaves and that only a triple mutant will show a complete block in vlcfa elongation from _PROTEIN_ to . unexpectedly we found that the average total leaf wax load of the _PROTEIN_ mutant was greater than the wild type although this difference was determined to be statistically insignificant using a student s t test . . we are unsure of the reason for the increase in wax load we observed here and at this time our best explanation for this result is that we may be observing a compensatory effort by the plant to produce an effective cuticular barrier by producing more wax when the cuticle structure is compromised . further investigations of the _PROTEIN_ phenotype exploration of the _PROTEIN_ phenotype as well as double and triple mutant analyses are currently underway . our analysis of the _PROTEIN_ mutant revealed that despite having the catalytic his residue of the conserved hxxxd acyltransferase motif replaced by an asn _PROTEIN_ has a metabolic function in wax biosynthesis . this is in stark contrast to other characterized bahd acyltransferases and suggests that _PROTEIN_ may not be an acyltransferase . _PROTEIN_ homology to _PROTEIN_ and similar roles of these proteins in vlcfa elongation led us to question whether _PROTEIN_ has acyltransferase activity . we used site directed mutagenesis to modify the catalytic his residue of _PROTEIN_ to determine if it is required for _PROTEIN_ function . we replaced his with ala to presumably knock out any catalytic activity at this site and asn to mimic _PROTEIN_ . we then transformed constructs carrying these mutant alleles of _PROTEIN_ as well as a wild type control into _PROTEIN_ plants . in each case we confirmed the insertion of the transgene by pcr based genotyping and presence of the mutation by sanger sequencing of the transgene . both mutant alleles fully complemented the mutant phenotype indicating that _PROTEIN_ does not share the same catalytic mechanism as characterized members of the bahd acyltransferase family . the wax phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants demonstrate a role for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in specific vlcfa elongation steps required for wax synthesis . however their biochemical functions are uncertain . they could serve as condensing enzymes in the elongation of vlcfas longer than _PROTEIN_ or facilitate acyl chain extension past _PROTEIN_ catalyzed by a condensing enzyme such as _PROTEIN_ . to establish whether _PROTEIN_ is sufficient for _PROTEIN_ elongation to we _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in yeast cells in combination with from the crucifer lesquerella fendleri . elongates _PROTEIN_ vlcfa to _PROTEIN_ the proposed substrate for _PROTEIN_ and also produces a lesser amount of vlcfa . we detected _PROTEIN_ vlcfa and trace amounts of vlcfa in yeast cells transformed with _PROTEIN_ and equivalent to what is produced when is _PROTEIN_ alone . this result indicates that _PROTEIN_ is not sufficient for _PROTEIN_ elongation . the dominant role of the _PROTEIN_ condensing enzyme in cuticular wax elongation led us to suspect that concerted activity of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may be required for the production of vlcfa . therefore we _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ individually and together in yeast . cells transformed with _PROTEIN_ alone showed no change in fatty acid profile relative to the wild type . a very small amount of _PROTEIN_ was detected in the strain _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ however this can also be seen though to a lesser degree in the wild type strain . it has been previously reported that wild type yeast can produce very small amounts of this vlcfa cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ accumulated a much greater amount of _PROTEIN_ vlcfa but no vlcfa . remarkably in the strain _PROTEIN_ both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we detected a fold increase in the yield of _PROTEIN_ vlcfa compared with the strain _PROTEIN_ only _PROTEIN_ and an additional peak which we identified as fatty acid . therefore the combined activity of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is necessary and sufficient for acyl chain elongation to for cuticular wax production in arabidopsis .
