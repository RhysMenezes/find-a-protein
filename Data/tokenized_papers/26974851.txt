three individual plants presenting retarded growth were selected from the screened seed pools containing oe _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ . the sequencing of oe plants identified three independent _PROTEIN_ lines _PROTEIN_ and . the _PROTEIN_ mrna _PROTEIN_ level of the _PROTEIN_ oe lines was also analyzed . and homozygotes of these lines were used for further characterization . the rosette diameter of wt plants was between and cm whereas the rosette diameters of the _PROTEIN_ plants were and cm . the bolting time of _PROTEIN_ was c. d which was c. d after the bolting time of the wt plants when grown under normal conditions . a water stress test was applied to the plants and the _PROTEIN_ plants were more sensitive to water stress relative to the wt plants . a similar result was obtained in the water loss test which was performed by drying rosettes without roots on the bench top and then weighing every min to measure the rate of water loss . because the _PROTEIN_ plants were sensitive to dehydration we suspected that their endogenous proline level might be different from that of the wt plants under water stress . the and wt plants were grown under normal soil conditions for wk and then water was withheld for d. the proline level was significantly higher in the wt plants than in the _PROTEIN_ plants after d of water stress however differences were not observed when the plants were grown under normal conditions and at the early stage of water stress . we further investigated the seed germination sensitivity to aba . at aba the germination rate of the wt seeds dropped to whereas the _PROTEIN_ seeds _PROTEIN_ a rate of . the germination rates of the _PROTEIN_ seeds treated with aba were also much higher than that of the wt seeds indicating that _PROTEIN_ seed germination is insensitive to aba . we also measured stomatal apertures using leaf epidermal strips treated with light dark and aba . these results indicated that _PROTEIN_ overexpression reduced the sensitivity of stomatal aperture to dark and aba . we further examined stomatal movements in response to applied or sa also known to close the stomata . these results also showed that the stomatal aperture of _PROTEIN_ lines did not response to or sa either . transient _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts showed that _METHOD_ was localized in the _LOCATION_ which is consistent with the function of _PROTEIN_ as a transcription _PROTEIN_ . to determine the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ patterns under stress we dried a. thaliana plants for min and then allowed them to recover for another min . _PROTEIN_ mrna induction was detected in the first min of water stress and reached a peak at h . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was also tested by spraying aba on the wt plants . in response to aba _PROTEIN_ induction was observed at min and peaked at min and it subsequently declined dramatically . histochemical staining was used to compare _PROTEIN_ induction among the water stress wounding and aba treatments . a promoter region of _PROTEIN_ was used to prepare _PROTEIN_ gus transgenic plants . wt and _PROTEIN_ gus homozygous transgenic plants grown on _METHOD_ plates were used for gus staining . gus staining was detected in the vascular tissue at the cotyledon tips of the _PROTEIN_ gus plants before the stress treatments . _PROTEIN_ was highly _PROTEIN_ in response to water stress wounding and application of aba . however the aba induction of gus activity was lower than that observed in response to water stress or wounding . based on our observations that _PROTEIN_ mrna _PROTEIN_ was induced by water stress and aba treatment we searched the _PROTEIN_ promoter for using athamap . we found that a zipper class i protein binding site was located at a position between and . himmelbach et al . reported that the homeobox protein _PROTEIN_ a hdzip class i protein physically interacts with _PROTEIN_ and regulates aba signaling and they also reported that when the binding site is modified _PROTEIN_ loses its binding ability . to elucidate the roles of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ activation we produced luciferase reporter constructs containing the _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ and a promoter with a mutation in the putative _PROTEIN_ binding site _PROTEIN_ . we also cloned _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as effectors . the greatest activation was achieved by the combination of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ whereas only a medium level of activation was observed with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ alone . when the _PROTEIN_ reporter was introduced with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ into the protoplasts activation was not observed . the results suggested that activation of _PROTEIN_ is involved in the binding of _PROTEIN_ to the _PROTEIN_ promoter . thus _PROTEIN_ may be a direct target of _PROTEIN_ activation and _PROTEIN_ may also be required for the increased activation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . these results also indicated that _PROTEIN_ mrna _PROTEIN_ could not be induced by _PROTEIN_ itself . because the _PROTEIN_ plants presented a and phenotype we hypothesized that the aba negative regulator _PROTEIN_ might have been activated in the _PROTEIN_ oe lines . when we analyzed the mrna _PROTEIN_ levels of the genes in the _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants we found that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ and lines were and higher than that of the wt plants respectively . we constructed _PROTEIN_ rnai lines for further study and found that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ mrna in the and lines was c. and of the _PROTEIN_ in the wt plants respectively . moreover the morphology and drought resistance of the rnai lines were not different from those of the wt plants . to confirm the regulatory relationship between abi _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ under stress conditions wt plants and and lines were subjected to water stress and the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the and lines was and of the _PROTEIN_ in the wt plants respectively and the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the and lines was and of the _PROTEIN_ in the wt plants respectively . however the _PROTEIN_ mrna level in the and lines was approximately the same as that of the wt plants under normal conditions whereas the level in the and lines was reduced to and under water stress respectively . this result suggests that _PROTEIN_ may play an important role in regulating _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ under normal and water stress conditions but has less of an effect on _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ . accordingly _PROTEIN_ might act upstream of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is a positive regulator of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ acts upstream of _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrna levels were compared among plants of the _PROTEIN_ knockout line _PROTEIN_ the dominant mutant line _PROTEIN_ the line and the line . as shown in fig . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ knockout mutant was reduced by compared with that of the wt plants and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was reduced by half . however the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ level was times higher and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ level was times higher in the _PROTEIN_ mutant line relative to the line . based on these results which are shown in fig . and we suggest that _PROTEIN_ might act upstream of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . to test the hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ is a direct downstream target of _PROTEIN_ regulation the promoter of _PROTEIN_ was investigated . no known binding sequences of _PROTEIN_ domain transcription _PROTEIN_ were found . the binding ability of _PROTEIN_ has not been investigated for the four known of the _PROTEIN_ domain transcription . subsequently we found that _PROTEIN_ did not bind to a gcc box which is one of the _PROTEIN_ binding and the transcriptional activation domain of _PROTEIN_ was located in the between amino acids and . this finding suggests that _PROTEIN_ might bind to an unknown in the _PROTEIN_ promoter . to test this possibility we generated a luciferase reporter controlled by bp of the _PROTEIN_ promoter sequence _PROTEIN_ . a transient _PROTEIN_ assay with _PROTEIN_ as an effector showed that _PROTEIN_ promoter activity was indeed induced by _PROTEIN_ . we further divided the _PROTEIN_ promoter sequence into five overlapping fragments that included _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and each fragment was joined with a minimal promoter . only _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were activated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ overlapped with _PROTEIN_ by bp . we then constructed a reporter containing only the overlapping region fused to the minimal promoter and found that this reporter was activated by _PROTEIN_ to a similar extent as the promoter or _PROTEIN_ construct . we attempted to narrow down the bp further but failed to obtain clear results . accordingly we propose that the _PROTEIN_ is located within this promoter region of _PROTEIN_ . to further elucidate the _PROTEIN_ binding sequence we produced _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines . the _PROTEIN_ fusion protein binds to dexamethasone a ligand of _PROTEIN_ and then translocates to the _LOCATION_ to regulate the mrna _PROTEIN_ of its target genes . to identify genes that are directly regulated by _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ transgenic line was grown under normal conditions and treated with dex and cycloheximide to block protein synthesis to prevent secondary transcriptional regulation downstream of _PROTEIN_ regulation . the gene _PROTEIN_ patterns were then analyzed using a microarray . to exclude genes that were induced by dex and cyc as well as genes from the transgenic plant background analyses of two sets of microarrays were performed . one microarray was composed of _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants treated with cyc for h and then dex for h and _PROTEIN_ plants treated only with cyc as the control and the other microarray was composed of _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants treated with cyc for h and then dex for h and wt plants treated with dex and cyc as the control . the data sets of the microarray analysis are available at the national center for biotechnology information website . the common genes obtained from these two data sets were considered to represent the putative _PROTEIN_ direct downstream genes . the promoter regions of the most highly genes were analyzed using the etfbs program . we found a conserved sequence accgnccaat in the promoter region of of these genes and this putative was referred to as the . the same _PROTEIN_ ccg cc has also been found using microarrays . a comparison of the _PROTEIN_ region in the _PROTEIN_ promoter with the bioinformatic predictions led us to hypothesize that the sequence _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ promoter is the _PROTEIN_ responsible for _PROTEIN_ regulation of _PROTEIN_ . the putative from the most genes of the _PROTEIN_ microarray data set are listed in table . we then created a reporter construct in which the putative _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ promoter was deleted _PROTEIN_ and the results showed that the luciferase reporter activity was no longer induced by _PROTEIN_ . thus the _PROTEIN_ sequence is responsible for _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and is probably the site of _PROTEIN_ promoter binding . for the genes in the microarray data set enrichment of any specific was not observed using the etfbs program . however we manually searched the promoter region of the genes and found that certain promoters contained the conserved . a number of these promoters were selected for further experiments . to demonstrate the direct binding of _PROTEIN_ to the putative we performed electromobility shift assays _METHOD_ using a recombinant _PROTEIN_ fusion protein . as shown in fig . the probe specifically bound the probe although the addition of the unlabeled probe reduced the extent of the binding . a probe containing the putative in the _PROTEIN_ promoter also showed _PROTEIN_ binding . because the for _PROTEIN_ binding predicted by bioinformatics was slightly different from the in the _PROTEIN_ promoter we designed another probe corresponding to the predicted and other probes to test the importance of each base for _PROTEIN_ binding . _PROTEIN_ binding to the cp probe was similar to the binding of and . the probes and also showed relatively strong binding however other mutated probes did not bind _PROTEIN_ . our findings support the model summarized in fig . whereby _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is regulated by the cooperative action of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ subsequently regulates the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ under normal and water stress conditions . _PROTEIN_ might also regulate the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . based on the earlier analysis the consensus _PROTEIN_ binding motif is cgncca . once this variation in the first two bases was taken into account we observed that many of the genes by _PROTEIN_ in table contained more than two in their promoter regions . to identify the biological functions of the direct downstream genes regulated by _PROTEIN_ we scanned the most genes in the _PROTEIN_ microarray data set and identified genes containing at least one putative in their promoter region . a gene ontology analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ may be involved in developmental processes stimulus responses biological regulation localization and transporter activity because these categories were overrepresented in the putative _PROTEIN_ genes . we also observed many genes in the genes in table . the gene ontology consortium website was used to identify genes categorized as phytohormones . table shows that many phytohormone genes related to biosynthesis and signaling were suggesting that _PROTEIN_ might directly regulate the transcription of these genes . we selected genes containing for further validation of _PROTEIN_ binding and performed _PROTEIN_ assays of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants subjected to several conditions . the actin orf and nc sequence which are located at position from the _PROTEIN_ transcription start site were used as internal negative controls in the _PROTEIN_ assay . promoter binding of _PROTEIN_ was clearly dependent on both the specific gene under study and the environmental conditions to which the plants were exposed . for example _PROTEIN_ bound to the of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ promoters only under normal conditions and not under stress conditions . similarly the aba biosynthesis genes dioxygenase _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and the gene responsive to desiccation _PROTEIN_ were regulated by _PROTEIN_ under normal and wounding conditions but not under water stress conditions . _PROTEIN_ presented different binding patterns with the in the promoters of ja biosynthesis genes including _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ dehiscence _PROTEIN_ lipoxygenase _PROTEIN_ allene oxide synthase _PROTEIN_ allene oxide cyclase and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ jasmonate resistant _PROTEIN_ and signaling genes including _PROTEIN_ and ethylene response _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ under the three conditions . furthermore we discovered that occur in the promoter regions of biosynthesis and signaling genes of additional phytohormones including ga br ethylene sa _PROTEIN_ iaa and sl . for example _PROTEIN_ bound to the of genes related to ga deactivation including _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the br signaling inhibitor _PROTEIN_ kinase inhibitor _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ receptors under normal and wounding conditions but not under water stress conditions . the ethylene biosynthesis gene synthase _PROTEIN_ the signaling gene _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ response _PROTEIN_ the sa biosynthesis gene isochorismate synthase _PROTEIN_ and the signaling gene phytoalexin _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ also contain the . _PROTEIN_ might regulate _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ under normal and water stress conditions whereas _PROTEIN_ appeared only to bind to the _PROTEIN_ under wounding conditions . however _PROTEIN_ was not controlled by _PROTEIN_ under any of the tested conditions . were also found in the promoters of _PROTEIN_ biosynthesis genes _PROTEIN_ sl biosynthesis genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and iaa transporter genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was bound to the of _PROTEIN_ and iaa genes only under wounding conditions . similar to and genes the in the promoter regions of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes were bound by _PROTEIN_ under both normal and wounding conditions . _PROTEIN_ was found to bind to the typical as well as to the sequence . for example _PROTEIN_ bound to the sequence tgcgaccaaa in the promoter of _PROTEIN_ under normal and wounding conditions aacgcccaat in the promoter of _PROTEIN_ under wounding conditions and tacgacctaa in the promoter of _LOCATION_ under water stress conditions . based on these results we concluded that cgncc is the core sequence of the . in the _PROTEIN_ assay discussed in the previous section it was generally unclear how the pattern of _PROTEIN_ promoter associations in different conditions correlated with _PROTEIN_ changes either activation or repression . in the _PROTEIN_ microarray data set we noticed that the genes contained the in their promoters and certain genes also contained the . this finding suggested that _PROTEIN_ could also mediate transcriptional suppression . to test the hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ acts as an activator and a repressor wt plants and _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines and were treated with dex and then subjected to water stress or wounding and the mrna levels of nine selected genes that showed binding to the in the _PROTEIN_ assay were measured at and min . to determine whether a gene is repressed or activated we estimated the slope of the regression curve generated from the three _PROTEIN_ values at and min for the wt plants and _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines . if a specific gene in the transgenic line presented a higher or lower slope than that of the wt the gene was considered to be activated or repressed respectively . additionally the gene _PROTEIN_ patterns of the wt and _PROTEIN_ plants treated with dex only and water stress or wounding without dex were also analyzed . this background information was useful for predicting whether _PROTEIN_ is an activator or repressor . accordingly the genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ under wounding and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ under water stress were found to be activated by _PROTEIN_ overexpression whereas the gene _PROTEIN_ was repressed under wounding . _PROTEIN_ did not present promoter binding under water stress but showed repressed gene _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ overexpression might act as a repressor of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under water stress . we propose that _PROTEIN_ might act as a transcriptional activator or repressor depending on the gene and the conditions . in the previous section we showed that _PROTEIN_ activates aba _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and ja biosynthesis and signaling genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines under wounding conditions . moreover under water stress certain ja biosynthesis and signaling genes were activated _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ although the aba biosynthesis gene _PROTEIN_ was not . therefore we hypothesized that ja content would be increased under both stresses while the aba content would only be increased under wounding in the _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines . to observe the physiological effect of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under stress it is essential to measure the concentrations of ja and aba in the wt and _PROTEIN_ lines . wt plants and _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines and were treated with water stress or wounding and the aba and ja concentrations were analyzed . we observed that the aba contents in lines and were higher than that in the wt plants under normal conditions and the aba content in lines and was slightly but significantly increased under the dex treatment compared with that of the wt plants . water stress in the wt plants increased the aba content which showed an increase at h compared with that recorded at baseline whereas only and increases were observed in lines and respectively . wounding for h slightly but significantly increased the aba accumulation in lines and compared with that in the wt plants . subsequently we observed that the ja content was induced in transgenic lines after the dex treatment under normal conditions . wounding for h greatly increased the ja accumulation in lines and compared with that in the wt plants . water stress also increased the ja content but to a lesser extent relative to that after wounding . these results are consistent with the results of the _PROTEIN_ assay and the gene _PROTEIN_ assay of the _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines subjected to the stress treatments . fig . also shows that opda an intermediate of ja biosynthesis slightly increased under stress treatment for h but still _PROTEIN_ low accumulation levels . the significance of the differences between the mean values for the dex treatment genotypes and stress treatments were assessed using a _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ results were consistent with those of student 's thus indicating that _PROTEIN_ overexpression indeed had a significant effect on aba opda and ja accumulation when the plant was under stress conditions .
