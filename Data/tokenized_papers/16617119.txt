fzo is a dynamin related _LOCATION_ remodeling protein that mediates fusion between mitochondrial outer _LOCATION_ in animals and fungi . we identified a single fzo like protein in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ a new plant specific member of the dynamin superfamily . _PROTEIN_ is targeted to chloroplasts and associated with _LOCATION_ and envelope _LOCATION_ as punctate structures . fzl knockout mutants have abnormalities in chloroplast and _LOCATION_ morphology including disorganized grana stacks and alterations in the relative proportions of grana and stroma _LOCATION_ . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ also conferred defects in _LOCATION_ organization . mutation of a conserved residue in the predicted _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domain abolished both the punctate localization pattern and ability of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to complement the fzl mutant phenotype . _PROTEIN_ defines a new protein class within the dynamin superfamily of _LOCATION_ remodeling _PROTEIN_ that regulates organization of the _LOCATION_ network in plants . notably _PROTEIN_ levels do not affect mitochondrial morphology or ultrastructure suggesting that mitochondrial morphology in plants is regulated by an fzo independent mechanism .
_PROTEIN_ was identified by a blast search of the arabidopsis protein database using drosophila fzo as a query sequence . the _PROTEIN_ cdna was amplified from arabidopsis by rt pcr and sequenced . the results showed that the annotated _PROTEIN_ amino acid sequence lacked residues at the c terminus . a blast search of the ncbi database confirmed that _PROTEIN_ shares similarity with fzo related mitochondrial fusion proteins . _PROTEIN_ encodes a protein of aa and is conserved in many photosynthetic eukaryotes including rice and chlamydomonas . _PROTEIN_ is most similar to fzo in its putative _PROTEIN_ domain . the _PROTEIN_ sequence also predicts two tm domains separated by a short linker and two coiled coil domains flanking the predicted tm domains . this domain arrangement is very similar to that of fzo . interestingly _PROTEIN_ was predicted by targetp to have a chloroplast transit peptide comprising the first amino acid residues at the n terminus suggesting that _PROTEIN_ may be targeted to the chloroplast in vivo . phylogenetic analysis was performed to investigate the relationship between _PROTEIN_ and other members of the dynamin superfamily . because the sequences are divergent only the _PROTEIN_ domains were aligned for the analysis . _PROTEIN_ and its homolog in rice formed a branch near the clade bearing fzo . these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ and fzo or at least their _PROTEIN_ domains may have arisen from an ancestral gene in the common ancestor of plants and animals . we obtained two _PROTEIN_ t dna insertional mutants from the arabidopsis biological resource center . the insertion in is in the region encoding the _PROTEIN_ domain . has two tandem insertions one in an intron between the exons encoding the second tm domain and a second in the utr . both fzl alleles conferred the same phenotypes . the leaves were visibly pale and flowering was delayed by days compared with the col wt . mature mesophyll cells in the fzl knockout lines contained fewer larger chloroplasts than in wt and these were heterogeneous in size . this phenotype was more pronounced in older than in younger leaves . mesophyll cell chloroplasts in wt and fzl plants also differed ultrastructurally . in wt the lamellae comprising the grana _LOCATION_ were similar in length and evenly stacked and stroma _LOCATION_ spanning the grana were frequent . in fzl mutants grana lamellae were less uniform in length and stacked in a staggered fashion giving rise to a disorganized _LOCATION_ array . stroma _LOCATION_ appeared less abundant than in wt . although the mean number of lamellae/granum did not differ significantly between wt and fzl grana were longer in fzl than in wt . in contrast stroma _LOCATION_ in fzl were similar in length to those in wt but constituted a smaller proportion of the total _LOCATION_ network . intriguingly some grana lamellae were inflated at their margins and vesicle like structures were frequently observed . quantitative analysis of _LOCATION_ morphological traits to confirm that the mutant phenotypes resulted from disruption of _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ coding region fused to _METHOD_ at its end was _PROTEIN_ in fzl mutant plants under control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter . the mutant phenotypes were largely rescued by the transgene . however the mean lengths of grana and stroma _LOCATION_ were lower in the complementation lines than in wt although their relative proportions were restored . these results reveal a role for _PROTEIN_ in regulating _LOCATION_ organization and chloroplast morphology . the complementation results also demonstrated that the _METHOD_ fusion protein encoded by the transgene was functional . to determine whether the predicted transit peptide of _PROTEIN_ mediates chloroplast targeting the coding sequence from the to the amino acid residue was fused to _METHOD_ . the resulting transgene tpfzl _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ in wt arabidopsis plants on a camv promoter . in mesophyll cells of transgenic plants the _METHOD_ signal was coincident with chlorophyll _METHOD_ indicating its association with chloroplasts . in plants _PROTEIN_ a control _METHOD_ construct lacking tpfzl the _METHOD_ remained in the _LOCATION_ . only the chlorophyll _METHOD_ could be detected in wt plants . these results confirmed the prediction of targetp that _PROTEIN_ has a functional chloroplast transit peptide . to assess the in vivo localization of _PROTEIN_ we took advantage of fzl plants that had been complemented by the functional _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene . _PROTEIN_ levels varied in different transgenic lines as indicated by visibly detectable differences in the _METHOD_ signal and the amount of _METHOD_ tagged fusion protein on immunoblots . in all cases however _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ exhibited a punctate pattern of localization . at lower levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ puncta were most evident at the chloroplast periphery although very faint puncta could be detected in the organelle interior . at higher levels small puncta were clearly visible throughout the chloroplast . the association of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with the chloroplast is consistent with the presence of a chloroplast transit peptide . on rare occasions _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ puncta that appeared separated from the chloroplasts could also be observed . we investigated the subplastidic localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ by carrying out a series of protease protection and fractionation assays using chloroplasts isolated from the transgenic fzl plants complemented by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in the first set of experiments we treated intact chloroplasts with the protease thermolysin which can not penetrate the outer envelope or trypsin which penetrates the outer but not the inner envelope and we used immunoblotting with anti _METHOD_ antibodies to determine the susceptibility of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to proteolysis . as a stromal marker we used _PROTEIN_ an inner envelope protein facing the stroma . as an intermembrane space marker we used a c terminal _METHOD_ fusion to _PROTEIN_ an inner envelope protein whose c terminus faces the intermembrane space . the marker proteins behaved as expected _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was susceptible to trypsin but not thermolysin whereas _PROTEIN_ was protected from both proteases . like _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was fully protected from both proteases . if chloroplasts were lysed before protease treatment however _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was degraded indicating that protection from thermolysin and trypsin was due to inaccessibility of the proteases to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and not to protein folding . these results show that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is targeted to the stromal side of the chloroplast envelope . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ protein the isolated chloroplasts were lysed in hypotonic solution and separated into pellet and soluble fractions by centrifugation . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the inner envelope marker _PROTEIN_ were both found in the pellet fraction by immunoblotting whereas the soluble stromal marker protein _PROTEIN_ was detected _PROTEIN_ in the soluble fraction . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ could be solubilized by treatment of the pellet fraction with triton x . these data confirm that _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ protein as predicted by sequence analysis . to determine which chloroplast _LOCATION_ fraction contained _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ from hypotonically lysed chloroplasts were fractionated into _LOCATION_ and envelope fractions . immunoblot analysis indicated that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was present in both fractions . as controls _PROTEIN_ and the _LOCATION_ marker lhcb were detected only in the envelope and _LOCATION_ fractions respectively . together the _LOCATION_ fractionation and protease protection experiments provide evidence that _PROTEIN_ is a chloroplast _LOCATION_ protein distributed between the envelope and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . furthermore because _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is protected from trypsin as well as thermolysin the results indicate that the fraction of _PROTEIN_ associated with the envelope is in the inner envelope _LOCATION_ and that the bulk of the protein faces the stroma . we compared chloroplast morphology _LOCATION_ ultrastructure and _METHOD_ labeling patterns in fzl plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at different levels . when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ at a level that complemented the chloroplast morphology and ultrastructure phenotypes of fzl mutants the _METHOD_ signal was detected primarily in a few punctate structures near the organelle periphery although fractionation also showed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ . at lower _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ levels partial rescue of both chloroplast morphology and ultrastructure phenotypes was observed although _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was not readily detectable . at higher levels the chloroplast morphology defects were fully rescued _METHOD_ but the distribution between grana and stroma _LOCATION_ was perturbed and very few completely unstacked lamellae were observed . these overexpression lines had more _METHOD_ labeled punctate structures at the chloroplast periphery and in the organelle interior were also slightly more pale than wt and flowered a few days earlier . overall the number and size of _METHOD_ labeled punctate structures increased with increasing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ level . together with the abnormalities observed in the fzl mutants these experiments indicate that the level of _PROTEIN_ influences the morphology and organization of _LOCATION_ . lysine in the predicted _PROTEIN_ domain of _PROTEIN_ is conserved in the active sites of many _PROTEIN_ . mutation of the equivalent residue in fzo has been shown to abolish its function . to investigate the importance of the predicted _PROTEIN_ domain for _PROTEIN_ function we mutated lysine in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to methionine to produce _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ the transgene in fzl mutant and wt plants under control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter . immunoblotting showed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulated to levels comparable to those of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . however _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ failed to rescue the fzl chloroplast morphology defects at any level of _PROTEIN_ . furthermore the mutant protein could not be detected in punctate structures in either the fzl or wt backgrounds . these findings suggest that _PROTEIN_ binding and/or hydrolysis is required both for _PROTEIN_ function and for its punctate pattern of localization and that the punctate localization reflects an important property of _PROTEIN_ function . in yeast and animals fzo mediates fusion of mitochondria . however mitochondrial morphology and ultrastructure in fzl mutants and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overexpressors were similar to those in wt . to further investigate whether _PROTEIN_ influences mitochondrial morphology we crossed fzl mutants with wt plants _PROTEIN_ a _LOCATION_ targeted form of _METHOD_ and compared the morphology of the mitochondria in the progeny using _METHOD_ microscopy . we found no obvious differences between fzl and wt segregants with _PROTEIN_ to mitochondrial size or morphology .
