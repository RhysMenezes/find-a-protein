the dual targeting ability of a variety of proteins from physcomitrella patens rice and arabidopsis was tested to determine when dual targeting arose and to what extent it was conserved in land plants . overall the targeting ability of over different proteins from rice and p. patens representing dual targeted proteins in arabidopsis was tested . we found that dual targeting arose early in land plant evolution as it was evident in many cases with p. patens proteins that were conserved in rice and arabidopsis . furthermore we found that the acquisition of dual targeting ability is still occurring evident in p. patens as well as rice and arabidopsis . the loss of dual targeting ability appears to be rare but does occur . ascorbate peroxidase represents such an example . after gene duplication in rice individual genes encode proteins that are targeted to a single organelle . although we found that dual targeting was generally conserved the ability to detect dual targeted proteins differed depending on the cell types used . furthermore it appears that small changes in the targeting signal can result in a loss of dual targeting ability . overall examination of the targeting signals within this study did not reveal any clear patterns that would predict dual targeting ability . the acquisition of dual targeting ability also appears to be coordinated between proteins . mitochondrial intermembrane space import and assembly a protein involved in oxidative folding in mitochondria and _LOCATION_ provides an example where acquisition of dual targeting is accompanied by the dual targeting of substrate proteins .
in land plants proteins have been experimentally reported to be dual targeted to mitochondria and _LOCATION_ or mitochondria and _LOCATION_ . to determine when dual targeting arose in land plant evolution and if dual targeting ability is conserved we investigated whether the orthologs of some dual targeted proteins in arabidopsis were also dual targeted in p. patens and rice . as p. patens diverged from arabidopsis approximately million years ago it represents the earliest land plant with a complete genome sequence allowing identification of all orthologs within gene families of arabidopsis dual targeted proteins . it should be noted that for many dual targeted proteins location specific orthologs also exist . therefore identification of all gene family members is required to ensure that all orthologous proteins are being identified when testing for targeting ability . we also identified the orthologs from chlamydomonas reinhardtii and chlorella variabilis and included them in the phylogenetic analysis to obtain a more robust characterization of orthologs . the predicted protein that showed the highest level of sequence identity to the arabidopsis dual targeted protein was defined as the closest ortholog and its targeting ability was tested . in addition we tested the targeting of p. patens proteins in arabidopsis cell suspensions onion epidermal cells and p. patens protonemal tissues as there have been no previous reports of targeting p. patens proteins in nonhomologous plant tissues . we also tested the mitochondrial targeting signals from alternative oxidase _PROTEIN_ and the subunit of the mitochondrial processing peptidase the _LOCATION_ targeting signals of the small subunit of rubisco and psi subunit and the peroxisomal targeting signals from thiolase and malate synthase in arabidopsis cell suspensions onion epidermal cells and p. patens tissue to define the _METHOD_ characteristics of these organelles in the various tested tissues . this demonstrated that the mitochondrial _LOCATION_ and peroxisomal red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ markers previously used in arabidopsis to define these organelles can also be used with p. patens . a number of orthologs to dual targeted proteins in arabidopsis were also found to be dual targeted from rice and p. patens . dna topoisomerase represents an example of a protein that is dual targeted to mitochondria and _LOCATION_ in arabidopsis and was similarly found to be dual targeted to mitochondria and _LOCATION_ from rice and p. patens . analysis of topoisomerase genes revealed that there are three in arabidopsis four in rice and five in p. patens . while the targeting predictions of the proteins differed using various prediction _METHOD_ it was apparent that topoisomerases were dual targeted in all three species when tested by biolistic transformation . while dual targeting of the rice topoisomerase was readily apparent in arabidopsis cell suspensions and onion epidermal cells dual targeting of the p. patens topoisomerase was only apparent in onion epidermal cells and in p. patens protonemal tissues where the mitochondria were elongated and cylinder like in shape . this elongated shape was similar to that observed with the control mitochondrial markers . thus while dual targeting of topoisomerases was conserved the dual targeting of the p. patens topoisomerase was not observed in all tested cell types . analysis of a large number of other proteins revealed that while many were observed to be dual targeted the ability for dual targeting differed between cell types . in the case of dna helicase previously shown to be dual targeted in arabidopsis the tested p. patens ortholog and the only rice ortholog were also determined to be dual targeted in all tested tissues . thus it differed from the p. patens topoisomerase that was not observed to be dual targeted in arabidopsis cell suspensions . however in the case of dna polymerase while the two arabidopsis orthologs and and the rice ortholog were observed to be dual targeted to mitochondria and _LOCATION_ the p. patens orthologs showed a different pattern . of the four p. patens dna polymerase orthologs three branched with the arabidopsis proteins . however was only targeted to _LOCATION_ in all tested tissues . in contrast while was predominantly targeted to mitochondria in arabidopsis cell suspensions _LOCATION_ and mitochondrial targeting was evident in onion epidermal cells . as in arabidopsis mitochondrial targeting was dominant in p. patens protonemal tissues with _LOCATION_ targeting only weakly observed . in an analysis of arabidopsis proteins that were previously reported to be dual targeted to mitochondria and _LOCATION_ rice contained an ortholog that was dual targeted in out of cases _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ while nine out of cases of rice and p. patens were dual targeted in the tested tissues _LOCATION_ . the dual targeting of proteins to mitochondria and _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ has also been reported with cases identified to date . the dual targeting of orthologs from rice and p. patens of phosphogluconolactonase _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and ala glyoxylate aminotransferase _LOCATION_ was tested to determine if dual targeting was also conserved when it involved another organelle the _LOCATION_ . the tested orthologs were found to be targeted to both _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ or mitochondria and _LOCATION_ in all tissues . overall in the analysis of four arabidopsis proteins that were dual targeted to mitochondria and _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ three out of four _LOCATION_ orthologs from rice tested in arabidopsis suspension and onion were dual targeted and two out of three proteins from rice and p. patens were dual targeted to mitochondria and _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . while a variety of proteins were observed to be dual targeted p. patens dna polymerase hinted that targeting to one organelle may be stronger or more efficient than targeting to another and that this may be associated with gene duplication . therefore a detailed study was carried out to investigate the dual targeting ability of a number of proteins that are known to be encoded by small gene families . enzymes of the ascorbate _PROTEIN_ cycle were chosen as _PROTEIN_ apx and _PROTEIN_ contain orthologs that are dual targeted in arabidopsis and are part of multigene families . _PROTEIN_ orthologs from rice and p. patens were similarly observed to be dual targeted in arabidopsis onion and p. patens tissue . in the case of apx four genes encode apx in p. patens five in p. glauca seven in arabidopsis and eight in rice . the arabidopsis apx designated as a _LOCATION_ stromal isoform has been previously reported to be dual targeted and this was confirmed in the current study . however examination of p. patens _PROTEIN_ revealed that it was only targeted to _LOCATION_ in all three tested tissue types . examination of the rice apx proteins and which grouped with and displayed the highest sequence identity to atsapx revealed that and were targeted to mitochondria while and were targeted to _LOCATION_ . to gain insight into when dual targeting of apx was gained the targeting of the most orthologous apx from p. glauca was examined and found to be dual targeted . thus it is proposed that the dual targeting ability of apx arose following the split between p. patens and p. glauca and was subsequently lost in rice following monocot divergence . in rice gene duplication resulted in two genes with each encoding organelle specific proteins . the gene family of _PROTEIN_ has multiple members identified with four genes in p. patens three in p. glauca five in arabidopsis and six in rice . previously shown to be dual targeted has two orthologs in p. patens one of which showed targeting to both mitochondria and _LOCATION_ . the detection of _PROTEIN_ dual targeted orthologs in all four species including p. glauca suggests that as with _PROTEIN_ dual targeting ability arose early in land plant evolution and has been conserved . however and are not dual targeted . this suggests that dual targeting of these _METHOD_ may have been lost after gene duplication in these _METHOD_ so that only a single dual targeted isoform is conserved in each organism . hexokinase proteins represent another example of the acquisition of dual targeting ability throughout land plant evolution . while the targeting of arabidopsis orthologs has not previously been studied a recent study in p. patens identified _METHOD_ that were dual targeted to mitochondria and _LOCATION_ . of the genes encoding hxk in this study at least six _METHOD_ are dual targeted . compared with the previous study some differences have been observed in that and were found to be dual targeted while was not . however none of the four hxk orthologs from arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ nor one hxk like _PROTEIN_ displayed dual targeting ability with four orthologs targeted to mitochondria and one targeted to _LOCATION_ . phylogenetic analysis of the dual targeted hxk _METHOD_ from p. patens reveals that five out of the six _METHOD_ branch together . this suggests that a single gene in p. patens encoding a dual targeted hxk underwent gene duplication as all proteins in this group display dual targeting ability . on the other hand also displays dual targeting ability most likely acquired throughout evolution as its closest orthologs are not dual targeted . because p. patens hxks are more similar to each other than to hxks in other land plants and because they have undergone concerted evolution this finding is consistent with the proposal that dual targeting arose after p. patens diverged from the lineage that gave rise to other land plants . in the case of _LOCATION_ mitochondrial intermembrane space import and assembly _PROTEIN_ represents an example of a protein that has acquired dual targeting ability during land plant evolution . _PROTEIN_ was first identified in arabidopsis as an ortholog to the essential yeast protein _PROTEIN_ . however subsequent work on the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ showed that it differed from the yeast protein . firstly the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ was shown to be a nonessential protein and was dual targeted to both the mitochondrial intermembrane space and the peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ . it was also demonstrated that the rice _PROTEIN_ was similarly dual targeted to mitochondria and _LOCATION_ . further analyses of the protein sequences from other plant _PROTEIN_ proteins showed that in higher plants _PROTEIN_ contains a known peroxisomal targeting sequence _PROTEIN_ while _PROTEIN_ from lower plant species does not contain this _PROTEIN_ sequence . thus the p. patens _PROTEIN_ was selected for subcellular localization assay . _METHOD_ analysis of revealed that it did not target to either mitochondria or _LOCATION_ and instead appeared to reside in the _LOCATION_ as evidenced by a diffuse _METHOD_ signal in all tested tissue types . while the lack of peroxisomal targeting is expected due to the lack of a _PROTEIN_ sequence at the c terminus the lack of mitochondrial targeting is surprising considering that all other known _PROTEIN_ proteins have been shown to be located within mitochondria . in addition the sequence was observed to contain the conserved cys residues and is highly similar to the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ in the enzymatically active domain . is missing amino acids from the n terminal end when compared with arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ . in an attempt to deduce the targeting ability of _PROTEIN_ over a wider range of plants _PROTEIN_ sequences from plant species ranging from c. reinhardtii to arabidopsis were examined for predicted targeting ability and also the proposed substrates for _PROTEIN_ copper chaperone for superoxide and copper zinc superoxide _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . it was observed that mitochondrial targeting of _PROTEIN_ as well as dual targeting of _PROTEIN_ arose relatively _PROTEIN_ in plant evolution . it was notable that p. patens volvox carteri c. variabilis and to a lesser extent c. reinhardtii lacked the first to amino acids compared with the predicted mitochondrial targeted _PROTEIN_ from other plants . however the peroxisomal acquisition of _PROTEIN_ is also accompanied by the peroxisomal targeting ability of and _PROTEIN_ . note that as previously demonstrated essential for respiration and vegetative can carry out the oxidative folding of proteins in mitochondria alone . it is therefore likely that and csd like proteins can be assembled in mitochondria without a mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ in p. patens and p. glauca .
