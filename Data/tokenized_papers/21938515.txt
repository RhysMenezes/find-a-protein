according to the atgenexpress transcriptome data sets _PROTEIN_ is an arabidopsis gene induced by several abiotic stresses such as salt cold and drought . here we isolated _PROTEIN_ and used semi quantitative reverse transcription pcr to verify that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was indeed significantly induced by salt osmotic and cold stresses in arabidopsis . _PROTEIN_ knockout mutants showed a reduced tolerance to salt and osmotic stresses coinciding with a suppression of the _PROTEIN_ of several stress responsive genes such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . consistently the restoration of _PROTEIN_ in the knockout lines restored the plants ability to tolerate salt and osmotic stresses . furthermore overexpressing _PROTEIN_ in the wild type arabidopsis resulted in an enhanced tolerance to salt and drought stresses . sequence analysis shows that _PROTEIN_ belongs to the s subfamily of basic leucine zipper transcription _PROTEIN_ . the transient _PROTEIN_ of green _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaf cells showed that _PROTEIN_ localizes in _LOCATION_ . a transactivation assay further suggested that _PROTEIN_ functions as a transcriptional activator in yeast and the two protein motifs are indispensable for transactivation activity . these results indicate that the tf _PROTEIN_ is a positive regulator of plant tolerance to salt osmotic and drought stresses .
previous studies have demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ tfs are involved in regulating plant responses to various biotic and abiotic stresses . the publicly available atgenexpress transcriptome data sets indicate that _PROTEIN_ is up regulated in responses to abiotic stress . therefore we isolated the full length _PROTEIN_ gene including the and utrs from arabidopsis thaliana genomic dna . sequence alignments revealed that _PROTEIN_ contained a conserved _PROTEIN_ domain which includes a basic region at the n terminus responsible for sequence specific dna binding and a less conserved leucine zipper at the c terminus responsible for protein dimerization . further analysis revealed that the _PROTEIN_ transcript contains a uorf of bp which is also present in other group s _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ that are involved in post transcriptional repression and sugar signalling . to better understand the function of _PROTEIN_ we used semi quantitative rt pcr to investigate its transcript levels in leaves and roots under various environmental conditions . as shown in fig . _PROTEIN_ transcript levels under normal growth conditions were greater in roots than in shoots . no obvious difference in transcript levels was observed between and week old arabidopsis indicating that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was independent of plant development . under abiotic stress conditions _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in different organs varied greatly . transcript levels were much higher in the roots when the plants were salt stress osmotic stress or cold stress . for each of these treatments _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ reached maximal levels at and h respectively . increases in _PROTEIN_ transcription were also detected in shoots after h of salt and osmotic stress treatments reaching a maximum after h of exposure . cold treatments on the other hand resulted in fluctuations in _PROTEIN_ transcripts in the shoots where _PROTEIN_ level dropped to almost zero at h and h but recovered at h and h and thereafter . these changes in _PROTEIN_ transcription levels under different abiotic stress conditions indicate that _PROTEIN_ might be an important gene involved in plant abiotic stress response . we fused the full length _PROTEIN_ and serially truncated fragments thereof to the dna binding domain in the vector and introduced the constructs to the yeast reporter strain . the fusion protein _PROTEIN_ was detected by western blot . lacz activity was assessed using a galactosidase filter lift assay . the vector was employed as a positive control . yeast cells harboring _PROTEIN_ and were capable of growth on the sd/ trp media however as shown in fig . only the yeast cells harboring _PROTEIN_ and grew well on sd/ trp his media indicating that only these constructs were capable of promoting transcription . the yeast bearing and could not grow on sd/ trp his nor did they demonstrate any galactosidase activity thus indicating a lack of transactivation activity . quantitative galactosidase activity assays showed that the full length _PROTEIN_ had the highest transactivation activity and that the deletion of its n terminus or c terminus would _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transactivation activity . however these deletions were not as serious as the deletion of larger n terminal and c terminal fragments whose deletion significantly _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transactivation activity . this indicates that the basic region of the n terminus and the fragment close to the c terminus are indispensable for transactivation activity . to determine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ a fusion of _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ under the control of a promoter was transiently _PROTEIN_ in the leaves of n. benthamiana . three days after infiltration _METHOD_ _METHOD_ could be efficiently detected under the confocal microscope at nm . n. benthamiana leaves infiltrated with the pceg vector displayed _METHOD_ throughout the entire cell but _METHOD_ in the n. benthamiana leaves infiltrated with pceg _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was observed exclusively in the _LOCATION_ demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ localized protein . we used wt arabidopsis and two ko mutants to examine the role _PROTEIN_ plays in abiotic stress response . the ko mutants were generated by t dna insertion and using rt pcr we verified that _PROTEIN_ was not _PROTEIN_ in the two ko mutants in contrast to wt arabidopsis indicating that _PROTEIN_ was effectively silenced in the two ko mutant . to determine whether the _PROTEIN_ knockout affected the plants tolerance to salt we exposed seedlings to increasing concentrations of nacl . when treated with mm nacl the germination of wt and ko seeds was greatly inhibited . when treated with mm nacl ko had similar but ko had significantly lower germination rate than the wt arabidopsis . on the day of the mm nacl treatment wt and mutant seedlings exhibited similar growth performance showing no significant differences in fresh weight . on day wt plants displayed better growth with more normal true leaves while the ko lines exhibited dwarfed and vitrified leaves . when treated with mm nacl the germination rate and fresh weight of wt plants was greater than that of the two ko mutants . on the day most plant leaves were dwarfed and vitrified . to determine whether the _PROTEIN_ knockout affected the plants tolerance to osmotic stress we exposed seedlings to increasing concentrations of mannitol . on _METHOD_ media supplemented with mm mannitol only wt seeds could germinate although they could not develop healthy true leaves . when treated with mm mannitol the ko plants exhibited a _PROTEIN_ germination rate compared with wt while the germination and leaf opening rate of the ko mutant remained similar to that of wt arabidopsis . about and of wt ko and ko seedlings respectively displayed normal true leaves however many more ko mutant leaves were vitrified . when exposed to mm mannitol the wt plants had higher germination rate and more opening leaves than the ko lines . however whether in wt or ko lines most of the seedlings had only leaves . to verify that the _PROTEIN_ resistance of ko plants to abiotic stresses was due to the knockout of _PROTEIN_ we generated _PROTEIN_ complementation lines _PROTEIN_ which _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of the strong constitutive promoter in ko mutant lines . two independent generation transgenic lines were identified by semi quantitative rt pcr where results showed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was restored to the ko plants . under standard culture conditions we did not observe any noticeable difference in the germination of the two _PROTEIN_ lines compared with wt plants . to test the resistances to salt and osmotic stesses at the seedling stage day old wt ko and _PROTEIN_ seedlings germinated and grown under normal conditions were transferred to _METHOD_ media supplemented with either mm nacl or mm mannitol and grown for days . as shown in fig . under mm nacl the maximum rosette size of both wt and _PROTEIN_ plants was larger than measured in ko lines . when grown in mm mannitol the growth of primary roots was significantly inhibited in the ko plants compared to that of wt and _PROTEIN_ lines . all of these results demonstrate that the _PROTEIN_ stress resistance exhibited by the ko plants was due to the _PROTEIN_ knockout and that the re insertion of _PROTEIN_ could restore salt and osmotic stress resistance to the ko mutant lines . to further characterize the function of _PROTEIN_ we generated transgenic plants by overexpressing _PROTEIN_ under the control of a promoter in wt arabidopsis . rt pcr analysis revealed more _PROTEIN_ transcripts in the transgenic plants than in the wt plants . we tested the salt and osmotic stress tolerance of wt arabidopsis and transgenic ox lines at the adult seedling stage . after irrigating with mm nacl for days the transgenic plants displayed greater salt tolerance than wt with many more green leaves . quantitative data showed that the _PROTEIN_ in total chlorophyll content was less in ox lines than in wt plants . as shown in fig . after the drought treatment most wt arabidopsis died while the ox plants survived and bloomed . these results were further quantified in an analysis of survival rates . altogether overexpressing _PROTEIN_ significantly improved the salt and drought resistance of the transgenic plants . previous studies have suggested that several genes are good markers of abiotic stress responses . in this project we chose _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as marker genes and examined their _PROTEIN_ in wt arabidopsis and the ko mutant under different conditions in an attempt to determine the possible regulatory relationships between _PROTEIN_ and these genes . our rt pcr results showed that all the genes responded to salt and osmotic stress in wt and ko plants however their _PROTEIN_ in the ko mutant was reduced in comparison to wt . _PROTEIN_ analysis of these stress response markers suggests that they have a close relationship with _PROTEIN_ in the plants response to abiotic stresses .
