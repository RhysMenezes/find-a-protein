six genes encode proteins with acyl coa binding domains in arabidopsis thaliana . they are the small kda _LOCATION_ acyl coa binding protein _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ associated _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ targeted _PROTEIN_ and kelch motif containing _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . here the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with an a. thaliana ethylene responsive element binding protein _PROTEIN_ identified in a yeast two hybrid screen was confirmed by co immunoprecipitation . the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was addressed using an _PROTEIN_ dsred red _METHOD_ protein fusion and a green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion . transient _PROTEIN_ of these autofluoresence tagged proteins in agroinfiltrated tobacco leaves followed by confocal laser scanning microscopy indicated their co localization predominantly at the _LOCATION_ which was confirmed by fret analysis . immuno electron microscopy on arabidopsis sections not only localized _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ but also to the periphery of the _LOCATION_ upon closer examination perhaps as a result of its interaction with _PROTEIN_ . furthermore the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in northern blot analyses was induced by the ethylene precursor aminocyclopropane _PROTEIN_ acid methyl jasmonate treatments and botrytis cinerea infection suggesting that the interaction of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may be related to _PROTEIN_ mediated defence possibly via ethylene and/or jasmonate signalling .
the yeast transformed with the bait _PROTEIN_ could not grow on and was tested negative on x gal colony filter assays suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ bait alone could not activate the transcription of reporter genes and lacz and was deemed appropriate for two hybrid screens . a tagged a. thaliana cdna library was introduced into the yeast harbouring plasmid _PROTEIN_ . the number of independent transformants was determined to be following transformation and plating of an aliquot of the yeast transformation mixture on . a total of putative positives were selected on supplemented with mm _PROTEIN_ medium . when these putative positives were further screened for galactosidase activity using the x gal colony filter assay nine yeast clones that appeared blue at varying intensities were identified as putative clones encoding interactors . putative library plasmids were retrieved and their nucleotide sequences were searched against the blast server http //www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cgi bin/blast . only one clone was in frame to encoding a full length ethylene responsive element binding _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . an _PROTEIN_ domain is present in _PROTEIN_ at amino acids . in another independent yeast two hybrid screen using the molecular interaction facility six putative positives were identified following selection on histidine drop out and galactosidase assays . subsequently they were used to retransform yeast mating type strain and were validated in mating and selection assays using the _PROTEIN_ bait the empty bait vector and unrelated baits . five clones were tested positive and further identified by nucleotide sequence analysis . results from analysis using the blast revealed that only one clone was in frame and it encoded a full length actin depolymerizing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein . however this was not investigated further in this study because it did not bind _PROTEIN_ in subsequent co immunoprecipitation possibly due to the absence of some as yet unidentified essential cofactor for binding in an in vitro co immunoprecipitation reaction . results of x gal filter assays are shown in . positive protein protein interaction results in activation of the reporter gene galactosidase in yeast cells which turns yeast colonies blue in filter assays using x gal . without interaction the yeast colonies remain colourless . as shown in the _PROTEIN_ fusion interacted with _PROTEIN_ as indicated by the blue colour arising from the production of significant levels of galactosidase . no interactions were observed in control yeast cells harbouring _PROTEIN_ and gal _PROTEIN_ . therefore from yeast two hybrid analysis _PROTEIN_ was identified as a putative protein that interacts with _PROTEIN_ . colony filter galactosidase assays of

of equimolar amounts of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ using the anti antibody . arrows indicate the positions of these proteins . proteins generated from plasmid derivatives of pbluescriptii _PROTEIN_ using in vitro transcription/translation were analysed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . an autoradiograph of the gel showed that the estimated molecular _METHOD_ of the in vitro translation products of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were kda kda and kda respectively according to their calculated molecular _METHOD_ . co immunoprecipitation of in vitro transcription/translation products to the _PROTEIN_ fusion protein immobilized to protein a/agarose beads using monoclonal antibody against showed that the _PROTEIN_ fusion protein significantly binds _PROTEIN_ . however no binding of _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ was observed perhaps due to the lack of cofactors which must be present for their in vitro interaction . to verify the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in vivo _PROTEIN_ was tagged to the n terminus of dsred and the fusion from the camv promoter _PROTEIN_ while _PROTEIN_ was tagged to the c terminus of _METHOD_ . following agroinfiltration of tobacco leaves with both _PROTEIN_ dsred and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ observations were carried out by confocal microscopy using a green filter to investigate the _METHOD_ pattern of _METHOD_ and a red filter to visualize the _METHOD_ of dsred . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was located _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ with some signals at the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ dsred was localized predominantly to the _LOCATION_ inclusive of signals detected in the _LOCATION_ surrounding the _LOCATION_ . signals of both fusion proteins were common to the _LOCATION_ . confocal images indicating co localization of _PROTEIN_ dsred and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaves . representative tobacco leaf epidermal cells are shown by laser scanning confocal

cells co _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ dsred not only _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ but also _PROTEIN_ dsred red _METHOD_ which overlapped with the _METHOD_ signals were detected indicating that fret occurred between _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ dsred . results from western blot analysis using total protein from week old arabidopsis revealed that anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies cross reacted with a band of apparent molecular _METHOD_ of kda as previously predicted for _PROTEIN_ . localization of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis leaves . western blot analysis using affinity purified

bars in represent and in . immuno electron microscopy was carried out using transverse sections of leaves of week old arabidopsis germinated and grown in _METHOD_ medium under a h light/dark regime . although immuno gold labelling with the anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies was mostly evident in the _LOCATION_ some signals were detected at the periphery of the _LOCATION_ . in the control when the primary antibody was replaced by blocking solution no significant immuno gold labelling was observed . the immunolocalization of signals at the periphery of the _LOCATION_ may have culminated from the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ . to address the coexpression of _PROTEIN_ and its interactor _PROTEIN_ further their spatial _PROTEIN_ patterns were examined . northern blot analyses were carried out using _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ full length cdna probes generated in pcr using gene specific primers . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ accumulated in leaves and _METHOD_ of arabidopsis young seedlings with lower _PROTEIN_ in the flowers and siliques . _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ showed higher _PROTEIN_ in roots . taken together _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ appear to have some overlapping _PROTEIN_ patterns in leaves and _METHOD_ which may represent the potential organs for their interaction in vivo . _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis on northern blot analyses . total rnas were extracted from wild type arabidopsis leaves _METHOD_ roots flowers and siliques . a gel blot containing about total rna for each lane was hybridized with an _PROTEIN_ specific cdna probe . the _LOCATION_ was stripped and reprobed with an _PROTEIN_ specific full length cdna probe . ethidium bromide staining of rrnas shown at the bottom indicates the relative amounts of total rna loaded in each lane . the blots were washed under conditions of high stringency . it has been reported that in young arabidopsis seedlings ethephon induces the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ after h indicating that _PROTEIN_ is involved in ethylene signalling . as _PROTEIN_ was shown to interact with _PROTEIN_ in vitro and both displayed some similarity in spatial _PROTEIN_ it was investigated to find whether _PROTEIN_ is regulated by ethylene and/or jasmonates . to this end week old arabidopsis seedlings were treated with mm aminocyclopropane _PROTEIN_ acid and methyl jasmonate . _PROTEIN_ mrna and _PROTEIN_ mrna were induced in seedlings at and h _PROTEIN_ or and h _PROTEIN_ following treatment with acc and meja . an acc inducible and meja inducible gene encoding plant defensin _PROTEIN_ was used as a positive control in these experiments . induction of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ after acc and meja treatments detected in northern blot analysis was compared with information available from microarray data analysis on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were not inducible in microarrays at h and h after acc and meja treatments and no data were available for a period exceeding h. northern blot analyses of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ following aminocyclopropane _PROTEIN_ acid and methyl jasmonate treatments and b. cinerea infection . accumulation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts in wild type arabidopsis plants grown in _METHOD_ media under continuous light following treatment with mm acc and meja . thirty _METHOD_ total rna per lane were hybridized to the respective probes as indicated on the right of the figure . the acc and meja inducible _PROTEIN_ transcript was used as a positive control . ethidium bromide stained rrna is shown below the blots to indicate the relative amounts of total rna loaded per lane hpt hours post treatment . inducible _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts in wild type arabidopsis plants infected with b. cinerea . thirty _METHOD_ total rna per lane was hybridized to the respective probes as indicated on the right of the figure . ethidium bromide stained rrna is shown to indicate the relative amounts of total rna loaded per lane hpi hours post inoculation . the blots were washed under conditions of high stringency . in arabidopsis both ethylene and jasmonate have been reported to be essential for the induction of a functional defence response towards the necrotrophic fungal pathogen botrytis cinerea . _PROTEIN_ of the ethylene downstream regulator _LOCATION_ is up regulated upon infection by b. cinerea . since _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrnas accumulated in response to ethylene and jasmonate treatments arabidopsis plants were subsequently infected with b. cinerea and tested for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrnas accumulated in the infected plants at h and h post inoculation while the control plant remained uninduced at these corresponding time points . our findings again suggest that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are probably associated with the ethylene and jasmonate mediated plant defence responses .

on synthetic dextrose agar plates lacking leucine . an aliquot of transformants was also tested on medium supplemented with mm amino triazole _PROTEIN_ because an absence of growth on this medium would confirm that the db bait fusion protein is unable to initiate transcription of . subsequently the bait carrying strain was tested negative for galactosidase activity using the x gal colony filter assay . this further showed that the bait was not able to activate transcription of the lacz reporter gene . the prey vector pbi a variant of was introduced into this strain and its inability to grow on medium supplemented with mm _PROTEIN_ and its lack of galactosidase activity were confirmed before the bait was further used in cdna library screening . to ensure sufficient coverage in the identification of potential proteins interacting with _PROTEIN_ yeast two hybrid screenings were also performed at the molecular interaction facility university of wisconsin madison using yeast
