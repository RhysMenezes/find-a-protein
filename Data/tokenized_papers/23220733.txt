anther formation and dehiscence are complex pivotal processes in reproductive development . the secondary wall _PROTEIN_ in endothecial cells of the anther is a known prerequisite for successful anther dehiscence . however many gaps remain in our understanding of the regulatory _METHOD_ underlying anther dehiscence in planta including a possible role for jasmonic acid and in secondary wall _PROTEIN_ of endothecial cells . here we report that the cystathionine synthase domain containing protein _PROTEIN_ located in the chloroplast plays a critical role in _PROTEIN_ of the secondary cell walls of the endothecium during anther dehiscence in arabidopsis . a t dna insertion mutant of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed increased secondary wall _PROTEIN_ of endothecial cells and early anther dehiscence . consistently overexpression of _PROTEIN_ resulted in anther indehiscence . exogenous ja application induced secondary wall _PROTEIN_ and caused flower infertility in the _PROTEIN_ mutant whereas it partially restored fertility in the _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines lacking the wall _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ directly modulated thioredoxin in chloroplasts which affected the level of and consequently _PROTEIN_ of the genes involved in secondary cell wall _PROTEIN_ . our findings have revealed that _PROTEIN_ modulates the status which is linked to the ja response and in turn controls secondary wall _PROTEIN_ of the endothecial cells in anthers for dehiscence to occur .
_PROTEIN_ consisted of amino acids which contained two cbs domains from to and from to . promoter analysis revealed that as flower development progressed _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in various tissues of the floral organs including the anther wall tapetum pollen grains and abscission zone . based on these developmental and spatial _PROTEIN_ patterns we focused on examining the function of _PROTEIN_ in anther development . we first obtained a t dna insertion line _PROTEIN_ from the arabidopsis biological resource center and identified a t dna insertion in the first exon of the _PROTEIN_ gene . the homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant was verified by genomic pcr and the _PROTEIN_ transcript was not detected by reverse transcription pcr analysis thus confirming that this mutant is a knock out line . sixteen transgenic arabidopsis plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter were generated and four independent single copy transformants were subsequently selected for further analysis . these plants were designated _PROTEIN_ ox lines . the _PROTEIN_ mutant and _PROTEIN_ ox lines were morphologically indistinguishable during the vegetative stage under normal growth conditions . noticeably the _PROTEIN_ ox lines showed much lower fertility than the wild type at the reproductive stage due to their inability to release pollen grains at the time of flowering . dissection of the flowers of wild type and _PROTEIN_ ox plants at anther developmental stages to revealed that the wild type anthers were dehisced and that the pollen grains were released prior to the full expansion of the stigmatic papilla . following pollination the pistil grew and developed into a seed bearing silique while sepals _PROTEIN_ and stamens became senile and ultimately fell from the elongating silique . in contrast anthers of the _PROTEIN_ ox lines did not dehisce and thus almost no pollen grains were released at anther developmental stage . pollen grains were not visible outside the anther until the initiation of floral senescence which caused absence of formation of seed bearing siliques . this result is a clear indication that anther development in _PROTEIN_ ox lines is defective to a level such that pollination is inhibited thereby resulting in the severe reduction of fertility . the stamens of the _PROTEIN_ mutant and _PROTEIN_ ox line were compared with those of the wild type by scanning electron microscopy _PROTEIN_ in order to identify defects in anther morphology . wild type anthers were four lobed at anther stage and they dehisced and split open along the stomium at anther stage . similarly the anthers of the _PROTEIN_ mutant dehisced at approximately anther stage although they were rather turgid at anther stage . in comparison _PROTEIN_ ox anthers at anther stage were dehydrated and shrunken so that stomium regions between each pair of locules were indistinct . the anthers remained closed at flower opening . however _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ ox showed normal pollen grain morphology with exine walls similar to those of the wild type . anther dehiscence requires the degeneration and subsequent differentiation of anther cells including those of the epidermis stomium endothecium and septum that are derived from the and layers during the second phase of anther development . to determine the role of _PROTEIN_ in anther dehiscence we prepared flower samples in three different developmental stages and compared the anther morphology of the wild type the _PROTEIN_ mutant and _PROTEIN_ ox lines using transverse sections . for the wild type at anther stage the tapetum had already degenerated and fibrous bands had appeared in the endothecium and connective cells these processes occurred concurrently with the initial steps of septum cell degeneration and stomium cell differentiation . for the wild type at anther stage pollen grains were released from the anther as a consequence of both stomium degeneration and the force generated by secondary wall _PROTEIN_ in endothelial cells . the cell differentiation events of the _PROTEIN_ mutant and _PROTEIN_ ox at anther stage including septum cell degeneration and stomium cell differentiation were similar to those of the wild type . however endothecial cells in _PROTEIN_ at anther stage had an irregular shape and were arranged in a rather complex pattern when compared with the simple arrangement of endothecial cells in wild type anthers . however the degeneration of the tapetum and septum cells in _PROTEIN_ at anther stage occurred normally . at anther stage endothecial cells in _PROTEIN_ ox were barely visible in any pattern although the stomium cell degenerated normally . moreover _PROTEIN_ ox anthers at stage still contained bicellular pollen grains instead of tetracellular grains . at _PROTEIN_ anther stage phloroglucinal stained the endothecial cell layer dark red in _PROTEIN_ less intensively in the wild type but not at all in _PROTEIN_ ox . this may reflect the amount of endothecium cells differentiated during anther development or the degree of secondary wall _PROTEIN_ accompanying lignification in endothecial cells after determination of the cell fate . secondary cell wall _PROTEIN_ in the anther endothecium provides the tensile force necessary for stomium rupture to release pollen grains . the accumulation of lignified materials which are the major components of secondary cell walls was studied under the light or confocal microscope following staining with phloroglucinol or ethidium bromide both of which are commonly used as specific stains of lignin . microscopic examination of phloroglucinol stained floral clusters of the wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ ox revealed the accumulation of large amounts of phloroglucinol stained anther cells in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ just before and after flowering . in wild type anthers a phloroglucinol stained portion was visible in the endothecium layer in the early stages of flower development subsequently spreading to the whole anther as flower development progressed in comparison in _PROTEIN_ at the same stages this portion was more enriched . an enlarged view of these wild type and _PROTEIN_ anthers representing stages are shown in supplementary fig . . in contrast very little accumulation of phloroglucinol stained tissues was observed in _PROTEIN_ ox anthers in all developmental stages . in a similar manner ethidium bromide stained endothecium cells as striated and spring like bands composed of cellulose and lignin in the wild type at anther stage . in comparison _PROTEIN_ anthers were found to have more lignified secondary walls which stained more strongly and appeared as complex and irregular spring like bands whereas little staining was observed in endothecium cells of the _PROTEIN_ ox anthers . all these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ causes reduction in lignification of endothecium cells . the secondary cell wall consists _PROTEIN_ of lignin cellulose and other polysaccharides . any defects in the deposition of these components besides lignin would affect the secondary wall _PROTEIN_ of anther endothecium cells . to examine if other _PROTEIN_ besides defects in lignification may have effects on secondary wall _PROTEIN_ in the absence and presence of _PROTEIN_ function we performed a transcriptome analysis of total rnas from unopened flower buds of the wild type _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ ox line using the affymetrix _PROTEIN_ genechip . as expected a large number of genes associated with the regulation of secondary cell wall _PROTEIN_ were significantly controlled by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . examination of the _PROTEIN_ profiles of secondary cell wall associated transcription _PROTEIN_ genes such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ secondary cell wall formation associated genes such as cellulose synthases _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ glycosyl transferases genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ like _PROTEIN_ gene and key _PROTEIN_ in the phenylpropanoid pathway such as phenylalanine ammonia lyase _PROTEIN_ and cinnamate hydroxylase _PROTEIN_ genes showed that the _PROTEIN_ of these genes was negatively correlated with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ up regulated in the _PROTEIN_ mutant and down regulated in the _PROTEIN_ ox line . the results indicated that anther indehiscence in the _PROTEIN_ ox lines was due to defective secondary wall _PROTEIN_ in the endothecial cells . consequently not only insufficient lignification but also variation in the _PROTEIN_ of the genes related to the other secondary wall components could cause anther indehiscence in _PROTEIN_ ox . consistently the early dehiscence of the _PROTEIN_ anthers correlates with the highly _PROTEIN_ secondary walls of endothecial cells when compared with those of the wild type although the fertility of the mutant was comparable with that of the wild type under normal growth conditions . we have identified two cbs to and from to the c terminal region using the smart search program as well as an alternative splicing variant that contains a premature termination codon in the sixth exon of _PROTEIN_ . this variant lacks the middle exons and c terminal region resulting in the loss of the second cbs domain . this truncated form of _PROTEIN_ mrna was designated _PROTEIN_ v . the second cbs domain is known to play a regulatory role in many enzymatic reactions and/or may be involved in the regulation of the intracellular redox status . therefore to confirm whether or not the biological function of _PROTEIN_ is dependent on the presence of these two domains we generated transgenic arabidopsis plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ v and selected four independent lines for further analysis . unlike transgenic plants overexpressing the full length _PROTEIN_ the transgenic lines overexpressing _PROTEIN_ v had normal fertility indicating strongly that the _PROTEIN_ transcript must be regulated by alternative splicing at the post transcriptional level . we constructed transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ a soluble modified green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fused to the c terminal end of _PROTEIN_ and observed that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein accumulated in the chloroplast . based on the results shown in supplementary fig . we hypothesized that _PROTEIN_ protein is functional in the chloroplast . therefore to characterize its functional role we first identified its protein partners using yeast two hybrid screening . sequence analysis of the positively interacting clones revealed that _PROTEIN_ interacts with x type trx and a subsequent pull down analysis using recombinant proteins further confirmed that the _PROTEIN_ protein interacts with trx x protein in vitro . an in vitro enzyme assay using insulin as substrate for the purified recombinant _PROTEIN_ and trx x proteins was then performed to determine whether the enzyme activity of trx x was altered due to its association with _PROTEIN_ . insulin has disulfide bonds that can be reduced in a cysteine thiol disulfide exchange reaction by trx . _PROTEIN_ increased the activity of trx x as shown in fig . . the chloroplast is known to be one of the major organelles responsible for reactive oxygen species production . one ros molecule has been found to contribute to the structural reinforcement of plant cell walls by increasing the formation of lignin polymers . it is also known that trxs act as antioxidants and electron donors to peroxiredoxins in order to eliminate . based on these results and those from our present study we hypothesized that _PROTEIN_ actively regulates the formation of chloroplast proteins that function as scavengers . to test this hypothesis we analyzed accumulation in the anthers of wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ ox plants by diaminobenzidine staining which reveals the presence of as dark brown precipitates . the anthers of wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants but not those of the _PROTEIN_ ox plants showed dark brown precipitates . the staining appeared to be darker in the anthers of _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type consistent with the results of the staining experiments for the lignified materials . these results indicated that _PROTEIN_ modulates production in anthers . to ascertain the possibility that the _PROTEIN_ of the secondary wall is associated with ja signaling ja was applied exogenously to bud clusters of the _PROTEIN_ mutant and _PROTEIN_ ox lines . in wild type inflorescences ja application caused silique failure in a concentration dependent manner and the average number of infertile siliques per inflorescence ranged from to with the treatments . in comparison with the wild type the average number of infertile siliques per inflorescence in the _PROTEIN_ mutant rapidly increased upon ja application there were an average of and infertile siliques following the application of and mm ja respectively compared with an average of and infertile siliques in the non treated and water treated controls respectively . in contrast in the _PROTEIN_ ox lines the number of siliques per inflorescence increased with increasing concentrations of ja with an average of and siliques following the application of and mm ja respectively but only an average of siliques in the water treated control . to clarify whether the rescued fertility of the _PROTEIN_ ox indehiscent anthers by the application of exogenous ja was due to the restoration of secondary cell wall _PROTEIN_ we observed lignified tissues in the anthers d after the mm ja treatment and found that both the untreated and water treated _PROTEIN_ ox anthers lacked dehiscent anthers during flowering and lignin staining in the endothecium layer . in contrast partially dehiscent anthers and red stained lignin were detected in the ja treated _PROTEIN_ ox bud clusters . in an attempt to determine a possible regulatory role for ja in secondary cell wall _PROTEIN_ we examined the _PROTEIN_ patterns of wall _PROTEIN_ associated transcription _PROTEIN_ genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in unopened buds treated exogenously with ja . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were strongly induced in ja treated wild type and _PROTEIN_ ox buds but _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ ox buds was lower than in wild type buds which was consistent with the results from the quantitative rt pcr . in contrast _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were strongly down regulated by exogenous ja application although the levels were much lower in _PROTEIN_ ox than in wild type buds . taken together these results reveal that ja is able to lead to or promote endothecial secondary cell wall _PROTEIN_ to ensure anther dehiscence during flowering and indicate that myb transcription _PROTEIN_ such as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may play a critical role in the ja induced secondary cell wall _PROTEIN_ in anthers .
