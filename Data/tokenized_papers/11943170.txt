sigma _PROTEIN_ binding proteins are involved in modifying the promoter preferences of the rna polymerase in bacteria . we found the _LOCATION_ encoded protein that is transported into chloroplasts and interacts specifically with the region of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . sibi and its homologue are novel proteins which are not homologous to any protein of known function . the _PROTEIN_ of sibi was tissue specific light dependent and developmentally timed . we suggest the transcriptional regulation by sigma _PROTEIN_ binding proteins to function in the _LOCATION_ of higher plant .
_PROTEIN_ is thought as one of the most abundant sigma _PROTEIN_ in a. thaliana . we have searched proteins interacting with the of _PROTEIN_ by yeast two hybrid screening . two positive clones were obtained which encoded the same protein but were heterogeneous in the length of their utr . to identify the corresponding full length cdna we screened the a. thaliana cdna library by using the obtained cdna fragment as a probe . the largest open reading frame in the longest cdna encoded aa residues . this protein was named sibi _PROTEIN_ . the sibi gene exists as a single copy in the genome . database searches showed that sibi is not homologous to any protein of known function . however one homologue with identity to sibi in a. thaliana was found . some cdna fragments from a. thaliana databases and other plant species also showed partial similarity to the sibi cdna . we tested the interaction between sibi and the _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ pull down assays . each preparation of mbp and mbp sibi was incubated with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ immobilized on beads . shows the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ image of proteins eluted by glutathione solution . lanes are the control experiments done with the addition of neither mbp sibi nor mbp . mbp sibi was detected only in the eluate from the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ beads . comparison of the input fraction and the eluate clearly shows that mbp sibi was selectively concentrated by the binding to the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ beads . mbp was not detected in the elution from the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and mbp sibi was not detected in the elution from the _PROTEIN_ beads . these indicate that binding patches are on the portions of sibi and _PROTEIN_ in the fusion proteins . western analysis with anti sibi peptide antibody confirmed that mbp sibi specifically co eluted with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and little with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the comparison of lane and lane suggests that more than of the loaded mbp sibi was bound to the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ beads . thus the results of the pull down assays confirmed the direct and specific interaction of sibi with the _PROTEIN_ . the binding specificity of sibi to _PROTEIN_ among _LOCATION_ sigma _PROTEIN_ in a. thaliana was examined by yeast two hybrid assays _PROTEIN_ . yeast cells co transformed with pas _PROTEIN_ and pact sibi _PROTEIN_ were histidine autotrophic and lacz positive . in contrast none of baits containing of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ activated the his and lacz reporter gene _PROTEIN_ in the presence of pact sibi indicating that the interaction between sibi and _PROTEIN_ is specific among the examined of _LOCATION_ sigma _PROTEIN_ . n terminal region of sibi is positively charged and rich in hydroxylated amino acid residues this is a feature of chloroplast targeting signals transit peptides . considering the chloroplast localization of _PROTEIN_ in a. thaliana it is expected that sibi functions in chloroplasts . we examined the chloroplast import of sibi by the protoplast transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ fusion proteins . as expected import of _METHOD_ into chloroplasts was detected in the protoplasts transformed with the tp f and _PROTEIN_ but not in those transformed with _METHOD_ . from these results we concluded that sibi carries the chloroplast targeting transit signal and localizes in chloroplasts . sibi mrnas abundantly accumulated in cauline leaves rosette leaves and roots but not in flowers and flower stalk . the size of the mrna in roots was larger than those in other tissues suggesting the possible existence of the tissue specific post transcriptional regulation . in the cotyledons and young leaves of days old sibi mrna was not detected independent of light or dark . while in older rosette leaves the sibi mrna level was clearly light dependent as greatly reduced by the h dark _PROTEIN_ and recovered by h re illumination to the level higher than that before dark _PROTEIN_ .
the cdna corresponding to the c terminal aa of a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ was amplified by rt pcr with primers eco _PROTEIN_ cg gaattc cgtttggagaacaatccg and pst _PROTEIN_ gg ctgcag tcaattcttaaggatcat . the amplified fragment was cloned into eco ri pst i site of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ the dna binding domain _PROTEIN_ region fusion protein _PROTEIN_ . a. thaliana matchmaker cdna library in _PROTEIN_ was screened by using pas _PROTEIN_ according to the manufactures instructions . full length cdna was obtained from a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ cdna library by a standard procedure . the cdnas corresponding to the entire coding sequence of sibi and _PROTEIN_ were amplified by rt pcr and cloned into nco i bam hi site of to generate plasmids pact sibi and pact designed to _PROTEIN_ ad sibi and ad hybrid respectively . the cdnas corresponding to c terminal regions of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were amplified by rt pcr and cloned into eco ri pst i site of _PROTEIN_ to generate a series of plasmids pas _PROTEIN_ pas _PROTEIN_ and pas _PROTEIN_ . these plasmids were introduced into the yeast reporter strain together with pact sibi pact or to be tested for their reporter genes _PROTEIN_ . as a positive control and were used which encode ad large t antigen and bd murine fusion protein respectively . the galactosidase activity was quantified according to manufacturer s instruction using crgp substrate . sibi was _PROTEIN_ as a fusion protein with mbp in e. coli . mbp sibi was recovered from the inclusion body or from the soluble fraction by standard methods . mbp sibi recovered from the inclusion body was collected as the fraction precipitated by ammonium sulfate . to recover mbp sibi from soluble fraction amylose column was used according to manufacturer s suggestions . the samples were stored at until use . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins with the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ in e. coli and immobilized on glutathione sepharose beads according to the manufacturer s instructions . the binding tests for mbp sibi and mbp to the prepared beads were done by incubating each combination of the samples at for h in buffer a . after complete wash by buffer a bound proteins were eluted by a glutathione solution and the eluates were analyzed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ followed by silver staining or western analysis . for the latter rabbit polyclonal antisera were prepared against synthetic sibi oligopeptide by sawady technology . anti sibi peptide antibody was affinity purified with the synthetic oligopeptide . western analysis was carried out with pvdf _LOCATION_ and ecl kit . the cdna fragment corresponding to the full length of sibi was amplified by pcr with primers u nco gg ccatgg _PROTEIN_ and d ncofull gc ccatgg _PROTEIN_ . the resulting dna fragment was digested with nco i and cloned into nco i site of _METHOD_ vector . the plasmids _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ alone _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fused with the transit peptide of rbcs _PROTEIN_ were kindly gifted by drs . niwa and kobayashi and used as the negative and positive controls respectively . protoplasts isolated from rosette leaves of week old a. thaliana grown under h photoperiods were transformed with each of the plasmids as previously described . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ from the transformed protoplasts was observed by a conventional _METHOD_ microscope _PROTEIN_ . the images obtained by cool snap ver . were processed using adobe photoshop . a. thaliana was grown at on vermiculite for weeks under h photoperiods to examine the tissue specificity of sibi mrna accumulation and for weeks under continuous light to examine the effect of light . flower stalks were nipped off to avoid senescence of rosette leaves . to examine the sibi _PROTEIN_ in young seedlings seeds were plated onto rm medium containing sucrose and grown at under h photoperiods for days . total rnas were prepared as described previously . northern hybridization was done with or each of the total rnas using the acc i cla i fragment of sibi labeled with dctp as a probe .
