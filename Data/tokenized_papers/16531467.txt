myb transcription _PROTEIN_ genes play important roles in many developmental processes and in various defence responses of plants . two arabidopsis type myb genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were found to undergo similar alternative splicing . both genes have four distinctively spliced transcripts that encode either myb related proteins or myb proteins . an extensive blast search of the genbank database resulted in finding and cloning two rice homologues both of which were also found to share a similar alternative splicing pattern . in a semi quantitative study the _PROTEIN_ of one splice variant of _PROTEIN_ was found to be differentially regulated in treatments with different phytohormones and stresses . _METHOD_ fusion protein analysis revealed that both of the two predicted _LOCATION_ localization signals in the domain are required for localizing to the _LOCATION_ . promoter gus analysis in transgenic plants showed that utr is sufficient for the translation initiation of type transcripts but not for type transcripts . moreover a new type of non canonical intron with the same nucleotide repeats at the and splice sites was identified . thirty eight arabidopsis and rice genes were found to have this type of non canonical intron most of which undergo alternative splicing . these data suggest that this subgroup of transcription _PROTEIN_ genes may be involved in multiple biological processes and may be transcriptionally regulated by alternative splicing .
two myb transcription _PROTEIN_ genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which were classified into the myb family share nucleotide sequence identity in their coding region and resulted from a relatively recent duplication event . four different transcripts that resulted from alternative splicing were confirmed by two independent pcr amplifications for _PROTEIN_ in an attempt to clone the full length orfs of all the myb transcription _PROTEIN_ genes in arabidopsis . pcr amplification to screen for possible alternative splicing in its homologue gene _PROTEIN_ were conducted and four distinctively spliced transcripts were also obtained for _PROTEIN_ . analysis of the spliced transcripts of these two genes indicated that they underwent alternative splicing in a similar pattern therefore the four transcripts of each gene could be designated into four different groups type is the longest transcript with the first intron unspliced type with the first intron spliced encodes a myb related protein with a single myb repeat translating from the second _PROTEIN_ . note that the splice sites of the first intron of the type transcript are different in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . type with the first intron spliced encodes a typical myb protein . the splice site of the first intron of the type transcripts is conserved in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the second intron in all of the above three types of transcripts is spliced and the splice sites are highly conserved and type has the least sequence similarity between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the only similarity that was found is that each has a non canonical intron with a nucleotide repeat at both splice sites . in the screening for the clones with different transcript inserts it was found that the ratio of type and transcripts were approximately . the type transcript _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ however has an extremely low abundance only one clone of the type transcript for each gene was obtained in arabidopsis . the orfs were predicted for the transcripts that were cloned by using orf finder software and the longest orf for each transcript was adopted as the putative orf which was consistent with the available annotation in genbank _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . although an orf was predicted close to the end of the _PROTEIN_ transcript this transcript was unlikely to code for a protein . the reasons are as follows the four upstream orfs existing in the long leader region of this transcript would strongly repress translation of the downstream orf and it has been shown that the transcripts with long aug burdened leader sequences were incapable of supporting protein synthesis interestingly except for the _PROTEIN_ all other orfs encode proteins that differ only in the myb domains . the _PROTEIN_ transcript encodes a protein with the repeat and the c terminal region . this is the first report that a myb gene encodes myb proteins with both single repeat and two adjacent repeats of the myb domain . in an extensive blast search of genbank four homologous genes of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were found in monocots . these homologous genes are _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and . it was found that from wheat is a partial cdna and apparently a type transcript . the other three cdnas two from rice and one from maize are type transcripts . to investigate whether these two rice homologous genes undergo similar alternative splicing two pairs of primers were designed to amplify the corresponding cdna fragments by rt pcr . several transcripts of these two genes were successfully amplified cloned and sequenced and were designated _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the sequences of these transcripts were searched against the rice genome and it was found that these transcripts were mapped onto the same genomic location as _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . from the sequences both and have three distinctively spliced transcripts corresponding to _PROTEIN_ type and transcripts respectively . all nucleotide sequence data have been deposited in genbank . the _PROTEIN_ that of wheat is a type transcript and of maize is a type transcript suggests that this alternative splicing pattern may exist in many plant species . this alternative splicing pattern which may have occurred before the divergence of monocots and dicots was conserved in this subgroup of genes during evolution . a previous study on the myb genes of arabidopsis and rice indicated that the exon intron structure was conserved among subgroups . these results demonstrated that besides the conserved exon intron structure the alternative splicing pattern may also be conserved in some subgroups of myb genes in both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants although its biological significance is unknown yet . non canonical introns were observed in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts . short repeats were found _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ and ctcat for _PROTEIN_ at both ends of the non canonical introns . interestingly a non canonical intron flanked by a short nucleotide repeat has been reported for _PROTEIN_ a gene controlling flowering time in arabidopsis . _PROTEIN_ had four distinctively spliced transcripts . transcript representing approximately of _PROTEIN_ transcripts was alternatively spliced at intron which was flanked by two bp repeated sequences ctgcag . after an extensive search of the arabidopsis genome database and referring to the list of arabidopsis genes that have non consensus splice sites identified by the institute for genomic research it was found that genes in the tigr list had non consensus splice sites and five other newly found arabidopsis genes were added to the list . together with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as well as the rice aquaporin gene that was cloned in another study genes with non canonical introns were listed in table . all non canonical introns are neither nor _PROTEIN_ type . some of these genes have already been demonstrated to undergo alternative splicing . these data suggested that there is a new type of non canonical intron existing in plants different from the well characterized and _PROTEIN_ introns . among these genes one was found to have no nucleotide repeats . two have more than one non canonical intron but only one intron with a bp repeat . the remaining genes with non canonical introns have nucleotide repeats of bp on both ends of the splice sites . no sequence similarity was observed among the repeats and no conserved splice sites or branch point regions were found for these non canonical introns . one interesting example is _GENE_ which has three non canonical introns each flanked by a distinct repeat . these repeat containing non canonical introns may be involved in a new splicing mechanism possibly a recombination like splicing mechanism . since only five out of genes were found to have more than one non canonical intron it is possible that this type of intron is not as common as the or _PROTEIN_ type in plants . the _PROTEIN_ that of these genes undergo alternative splicing may suggest a possible correlation between non canonical introns and alternative splicing . to characterize the _PROTEIN_ patterns of different splice variants of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ profiles of the transcripts were examined in different organs with transcript specific primers . the results indicated that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in leaves and seedlings whereas the _PROTEIN_ level was relatively low in roots and _METHOD_ and even lower in inflorescences . this result is consistent with that of reverse northern dot blot by citation . interestingly the different splice variants of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ in different organ specific patterns . for example _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in roots leaves and seedlings while the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and was only detected in seedlings . all four transcript variants of _PROTEIN_ could be detected in leaves but not always in other organs for example _PROTEIN_ the shortest transcript was only detected in leaves . notably the type transcript is the most abundant transcript in all tissues examined which is consistent with its highest frequency in the cloning experiment . the biological relevance of the organ specific _PROTEIN_ of these two genes is not yet understood . to study the _PROTEIN_ of these myb genes further rt pcr was performed to examine the _PROTEIN_ patterns of the different splice variants of _PROTEIN_ in phytohormone and stress treatments . the results showed that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was not detectable in the ja treatment or in calli cultured under light or dark conditions . by contrast the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was found to be elevated in nearly all treatments except aba and . for example the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ increased more than fold when treated with ja sa ga and ethylene and up to fold in calli cultured under light or dark conditions . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ may play a role in multiple signalling pathways . two basic amino acid regions krgk and rkkaqekkr were found to be highly conserved in this subgroup of myb genes and might serve as bipartite _LOCATION_ localization signals which is often found in plant transcription _PROTEIN_ . the differently spliced transcripts provide a good system to clarify the function of nlss in the subcellular localization of the myb proteins from differently spliced transcripts . _METHOD_ fusion protein constructs were generated for seven orfs of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with each full length coding sequence fused to the _METHOD_ gene and bombarded into onion epidermal cells . it was found that while the _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ was evident in both the _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm in the control experiments all type and type transcript encoded proteins i.e . myb proteins with single and two adjacent myb repeats respectively were clearly localized in the _LOCATION_ . type transcript encoded proteins however were only partially localized in the _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ a small protein of amino acid residues was also partially localized in the _LOCATION_ . it is worth noting that the type and transcript encoded fusion proteins of _PROTEIN_ share similar subcellular localization patterns with those of _PROTEIN_ confirming the reliability of the experiments . these results suggest that although located separately in the n terminal and c terminal regions of the repeat both of the basic nlss are required for _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the amino acid residues in repeats were examined further among all the arabidopsis myb transcription _PROTEIN_ and found that the consensus sequences corresponding to the predicted nls regions in the repeats of myb proteins in this study were rich in basic amino acid residues and conserved in almost all of the other arabidopsis myb proteins suggesting that these sites might be nlss in most arabidopsis myb proteins and play important roles in the _LOCATION_ localization . to determine the role of untranslated regions in the initiation of translation of type and type proteins further the promoter regions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were fused to the _PROTEIN_ gene with different translational start sites . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ use the second aug to initiate translation while the first aug remains in their leader sequence region . however _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were not included in this translation initiation test because the leader sequences upstream their orfs contain the complete sequence of the first intron which could be alternatively spliced into the type or transcripts in arabidopsis . histochemical analysis of transgenic plants showed that no gus activity was detected in type construct transformed plants . however in transgenic plants harbouring type constructs gus activity was detected in most tissues including seedlings mature leaves flowers siliques and _METHOD_ . this result indicates that the utr is sufficient to initiate the translation of type transcripts but is not sufficient to initiate the translation of type transcripts .
arabidopsis ecotype columbia grown on soil at was used . mature leaves _METHOD_ inflorescences and roots were harvested from flowering plants at weeks . siliques were collected _PROTEIN_ . the plant materials were treated and grown under the following conditions . a liquid culture system was adopted . surface sterilized seeds were germinated in ml of _METHOD_ liquid medium containing sucrose in a

. first strand cdnas were synthesized using the superscript ii rnase h reverse transcriptase kit according to the manufacturer 's instructions and then used as the templates for rt pcr amplification . rice rna isolation and cdna synthesis were carried out with the same protocols described above . one pair of specific primers was designed for each gene to amplify the fragments of interest in arabidopsis and rice by rt pcr with ex taq dna polymerase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ aaa ctt _PROTEIN_ caa gaa gaa _PROTEIN_ cta aag gcg acc act acc _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ caa gag gag gga

_PROTEIN_ . for _PROTEIN_ two amplification reactions were carried out respectively one with the primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to amplify _PROTEIN_ and the other with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to amplify _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ transcript did not actually form a clear single band by the primers _PROTEIN_ and possibly due to its extremely low abundance . but theoretically with the primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ could be amplified as a same sized fragment as that of _PROTEIN_ thus _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ share the same amplified fragment in the rt pcr . blast search against genbank nr database was conducted . phylip package was used to construct phylogenetic trees with the parsimony method . the shuttle vector _METHOD_ has been described before . primers
