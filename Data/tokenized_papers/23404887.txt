arabidopsis thaliana cyclin _PROTEIN_ kinase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ belongs to the family of cyclin dependent protein kinases that were originally characterized as cell cycle regulators in eukaryotes . here we report that _PROTEIN_ regulates pre mrna splicing of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and therefore pollen wall formation . the knockout mutant _PROTEIN_ exhibits reduced male fertility with impaired callose synthesis and abnormal pollen wall formation . the sixth intron in _PROTEIN_ pre mrna a rare type of intron with a gc splice site is abnormally spliced in _PROTEIN_ . rna immunoprecipitation analysis suggests that _PROTEIN_ is associated with this intron . _PROTEIN_ contains n terminal ser/arg motifs and interacts with splicing _PROTEIN_ arginine/serine rich zinc knuckle containing _PROTEIN_ through its rs region to regulate proper splicing . _PROTEIN_ and rs containing zinc finger _PROTEIN_ a splicing _PROTEIN_ interacting with _PROTEIN_ and small _LOCATION_ ribonucleoprotein particle component colocalize in _LOCATION_ speckles and reside in the same complex . we propose that _PROTEIN_ is recruited to snrnp through _PROTEIN_ to facilitate the splicing of the sixth intron of _PROTEIN_ .
we performed functional analysis of _PROTEIN_ in pollen wall formation and male fertility in arabidopsis . we obtained a t dna insertion line of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ from the _PROTEIN_ . the annotated t dna was stated to be inserted in the coding sequence of _PROTEIN_ . however pcr detection and sequencing analysis showed that the _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ cds fragment from to bp together with the annotated t dna was absent in this locus in _PROTEIN_ although the t dna was still in the genome of _PROTEIN_ . the cds for this truncated form of _PROTEIN_ contained a premature stop codon that would result in a truncated protein containing only a partial _PROTEIN_ n terminus . therefore this mutated protein is expected to lack cdk activity . _PROTEIN_ plants displayed normal vegetative growth similar to the wild type . wild type siliques contained seeds on average whereas _PROTEIN_ showed reduced fertility with only seed set . the anther dehiscence and anther length of _PROTEIN_ were similar to those of the wild type . an alexander s staining assay for pollen viability showed the _PROTEIN_ anthers contained very few purple stained viable pollen grains which was consistent with its low fertility . backcrossing with the wild type resulted in plants with normal fertility . in the population the male sterile mutant phenotype was inherited in a mendelian fashion with of the progeny displaying male sterility indicating that the reduced male fertility phenotype was caused by a single recessive _LOCATION_ mutation that was controlled sporophytically . for genetic complementation a kb genomic fragment consisting of bp upstream sequence bp cds and bp downstream sequence of _PROTEIN_ was introduced into homozygous _PROTEIN_ plants . in the progeny of transgenic lines showed restored fertility with normal pollen development and seed set . this indicates that the deletion within _PROTEIN_ was responsible for the mutant phenotype . there is another cdkg gene . however the t dna insertion lines of this gene had no obvious phenotype so we did not perform further analysis of the mutants . to understand the details of the developmental defects in _PROTEIN_ pollen development we compared semithin cross sections of anthers of _PROTEIN_ and the wild type . in arabidopsis anther development has been divided into stages based on morphological characters . before stage no detectable difference was observed between _PROTEIN_ and the wild type . however the microspores appeared to be shrunken in _PROTEIN_ anthers at stage . at stage most microspores of _PROTEIN_ were relatively round rather than the typical angular shape of wild type microspores . at stage wild type microspores had a trivalvular shape with dense cytoplasm while most _PROTEIN_ microspores were still round and cytoplasm leakage was observed from some microspores . after stage wild type microspores gradually developed into mature pollen grains . however most _PROTEIN_ microspores were gradually degraded after stage . to obtain some clues about the role of _PROTEIN_ in microspore development we analyzed the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ . real time rt pcr analysis with total rna from root stem rosette leaf and inflorescence indicated that _PROTEIN_ was preferentially _PROTEIN_ in leaf and inflorescence and weakly _PROTEIN_ in the other tissues examined . rna in situ hybridization with wild type anther cross sections showed that _PROTEIN_ exhibited relatively higher _PROTEIN_ at the meiosis and tetrad stages suggesting that _PROTEIN_ may play a role during these two stages . several mutants defective in pollen wall formation also show round microspores at stage . therefore we investigated pollen wall pattern of _PROTEIN_ via scanning electron microscopy analysis . the surviving pollen grains of _PROTEIN_ exhibited abnormal exine pattern when compared with that of the wild type . to further examine the reason for the pollen wall defect in _PROTEIN_ we performed transmission electron microscopy . in the wild type the primexine _PROTEIN_ was deposited between the callose wall and the microspore _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ at the early tetrad stage and the microspore _LOCATION_ became regularly undulated . however in _PROTEIN_ the primexine _PROTEIN_ was thinner and the regular _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ undulation was not observed . in the wild type the callose wall was less electron dense at the early tetrad stage a time when the electron dense sporopollenin was deposited on the outside surface of the callose wall . by contrast in _PROTEIN_ the callose wall was moderately electron dense and flat sporopollenin particles were observed on the surface of the microspore _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ at the early tetrad stage . at the _PROTEIN_ tetrad stage of the wild type the degenerating callose wall was electron dense and the sporopollenin was deposited as rod like probacula that were regularly distributed in the primexine _PROTEIN_ . however in _PROTEIN_ dot like sporopollenin particles were randomly distributed on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . at stage the exine composed of tecta and bacula was formed around wild type microspores while this layer was absent in _PROTEIN_ with only big sporopollenin granules around microspores . these results suggest that the primexine formation is defective in _PROTEIN_ . since the callose wall is important in primexine formation we investigated callose deposition at the tetrad stage by aniline blue staining . the callose wall _METHOD_ of the _PROTEIN_ tetrad was weaker than that of the wild type especially that of the peripheral callose wall . callose staining of tetrad stage sections showed that the callose wall of _PROTEIN_ was much thinner than that of the wild type . this was further confirmed by a callose _METHOD_ bleaching test . for the _PROTEIN_ tetrads randomly selected from tetrad stage buds the average _METHOD_ quenching time for the callose wall was much less than that for the wild type . these results suggest that callose synthesis was significantly reduced in _PROTEIN_ . in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ encodes the _PROTEIN_ synthase for the peripheral callose wall around meiocytes and tetrads and this callose layer is almost lost in _PROTEIN_ knockout mutants . we therefore investigated whether the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was altered in _PROTEIN_ . quantitative rt pcr analysis using the primer set for of _PROTEIN_ showed fold upregulation in _PROTEIN_ whereas the primer set for exon showed only of the wild type level . this suggests that the full length _PROTEIN_ transcript in _PROTEIN_ is present at most at of the level in the wild type . to further examine the abnormal transcription of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ additional primer pairs were designed for rt pcr analysis . when the primer set for exons to was used two pcr products were obtained in _PROTEIN_ . the smaller product was similar to the size of the pcr band from wild type cdna while the larger one was in a size intermediate between the smaller one and the pcr product from the genomic dna . sequencing showed that the larger product contained the bp intron of _PROTEIN_ . thus the sixth intron was only partially spliced in _PROTEIN_ . a stop codon occurred inside intron resulting in a truncated protein with only amino acid residues for the abnormal _PROTEIN_ mrna containing the intron . the other primer sets tested showed that other introns of _PROTEIN_ were spliced normally in _PROTEIN_ . to understand whether _PROTEIN_ is directly associated with intron of _PROTEIN_ pre mrna an rna immunoprecipitation assay was performed as described . we made two protein fusion constructs one tagged with myc _PROTEIN_ myc and one with green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . each construct complemented the phenotypic defects when introduced into _PROTEIN_ indicating that the two fusion proteins can fulfill the function of _PROTEIN_ . inflorescences of these transgenic plants were used for the rip assay . in the rip assay with _PROTEIN_ myc for the primer set spanning intron an expected pcr product was detected in the anti myc rip . this pcr product was absent in the anti myc rip with the wild type and in both mock rips of the transgenic plants and the wild type . we used the primer sets _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cds as negative controls . no pcr product was obtained from any of these rip cdnas . similar results were observed when we used _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ might bind to the _PROTEIN_ pre mrna . to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ can bind to other parts of _PROTEIN_ pre mrna a total of nine additional primer sets for _PROTEIN_ was designed for rip rt pcr analysis . pcr products were obtained only for primer sets covering intron and exons to . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is associated with the _PROTEIN_ pre mrna around intron . since _PROTEIN_ is a protein without an obvious rna recognition motif we hypothesize that _PROTEIN_ might bind to _PROTEIN_ pre mrna by interacting with some other proteins such as splicing _PROTEIN_ that have _METHOD_ . several cdks have been reported to be involved in pre mrna splicing including human and and arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ . these cdks share two common features they colocalize or interact with splicing _PROTEIN_ such as _PROTEIN_ proteins and they contain at least one rs motif in their n termini for example _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . rs motifs are thought to mediate the interaction with splicing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ proteins . _PROTEIN_ has an n terminus that is longer than those of cdka to cdkf . _PROTEIN_ contains four rs motifs in the n terminus including the last rs motif conserved in almost in all the _PROTEIN_ orthologs . we also compared the core region of _PROTEIN_ with those of arabidopsis cdks and the mammalian cdks related to splicing regulation . _PROTEIN_ is more similar to the cdks associated with splicing than the others including cdka cdkb and cdkf . in the phylogenetic tree of arabidopsis cdks the cdkg clade is close to the cdkc clade . therefore as these cdks are related to splicing regulation _PROTEIN_ might also interact with some _PROTEIN_ proteins with one to two _METHOD_ . we therefore performed yeast two hybrid assays to find potential _PROTEIN_ protein partners of _PROTEIN_ . the arabidopsis genome contains _PROTEIN_ genes . we cloned the cdss of these _PROTEIN_ genes into the vector and the cds of _PROTEIN_ into the vector . the yeast clones bearing pgad _PROTEIN_ and pgbk _PROTEIN_ were able to grow on the selective medium although their growth was slower than that of the positive control containing _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . these clones showed positive x gal reaction . these results show that _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ in yeast . to confirm and visualize the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in plant cells a bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation assay was performed based on split yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were fused with the n and c terminus of _METHOD_ respectively and transiently coexpressed in tobacco leaves . for two combinations _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals were observed in the _LOCATION_ with relatively stronger signals in _LOCATION_ speckles . no _METHOD_ signal was observed for the other two combinations yn yc _PROTEIN_ and yc yn _PROTEIN_ . the bifc assay confirmed the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . when the monomeric red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were coexpressed in transgenic plants we also observed their colocalization in _LOCATION_ speckles where most _PROTEIN_ proteins localize . this colocalization assay therefore supports the interaction between the two proteins . _PROTEIN_ is known to interact with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which further interact with a component of the snrnp . this suggested that _PROTEIN_ might be targeted to the splicing machinery through physical and functional interaction with _PROTEIN_ . to further verify the involvement of _PROTEIN_ in the splicing machinery we performed colocalization and coimmunoprecipitation assays with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . when coexpressed in tobacco leaf epidermal cells both the cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were observed in the nucleoplasm primarily in _LOCATION_ speckles . we obtained transgenic arabidopsis lines _PROTEIN_ both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _LOCATION_ extracts from the transgenic plants were immunoprecipitated using an anti _METHOD_ antibody . immunoblot analysis of the immunoprecipitated products using an anti _METHOD_ antibody detected a protein band consistent with the size of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein . this coimmunoprecipitation assay suggests that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ reside in the same complex in _LOCATION_ speckles . to define the region in _PROTEIN_ responsible for _LOCATION_ speckle localization we made several constructs using _METHOD_ fused with the _PROTEIN_ fragments . _PROTEIN_ contains a _LOCATION_ localization signal in its n terminus according to the predictnls server . when fused with n terminal fragments containing various rs motifs _PROTEIN_ to to and to diffuse _METHOD_ signals were observed in the _LOCATION_ of the epidermal cells . similarly for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lacking the _PROTEIN_ n terminus the diffuse _METHOD_ signals were observed in the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ similar to the localization pattern of free _METHOD_ . these results suggest that both the n terminus and the s_tkc domain are required for its _LOCATION_ speckle localization . the other three fusion proteins including _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ showed _LOCATION_ speckle localization similar to full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the _PROTEIN_ fragment includes the peptide from to which showed a stronger interaction with _PROTEIN_ than did the full length _PROTEIN_ . this to fragment contains a partial core region and an n terminal rs motif which is conserved in almost all orthologs of _PROTEIN_ in other eukaryotes . the core region also includes some critical residues for the function of a cdk including the putative substrate binding pocket . these results suggest that the fragment to including the conserved rs motif is sufficient to define the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ speckle localization and to interact with _PROTEIN_ .
