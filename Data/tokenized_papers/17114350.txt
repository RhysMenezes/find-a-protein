sulfur is an essential macronutrient required for plant growth . to identify key transcription _PROTEIN_ regulating the sulfur assimilatory pathway we screened arabidopsis thaliana mutants using a _METHOD_ reporter gene construct consisting of the sulfur limitation responsive promoter of the sulfate transporter and green _METHOD_ protein as a background indicator for monitoring plant sulfur responses . the isolated mutant sulfur _PROTEIN_ was unable to induce transcripts under low sulfur conditions . mutations causing the sulfur limitation responseless phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ were identified in an eil family transcription _PROTEIN_ ethylene _PROTEIN_ whose functional identity with _PROTEIN_ was confirmed by genetic complementation . sulfate uptake and plant growth on s were significantly reduced by _PROTEIN_ mutations but recovered by overexpression of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ functioned as a central transcriptional regulator which controlled both the activation of sulfate acquisition and degradation of _PROTEIN_ under s conditions . metabolite analysis indicated stable accumulation of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mutants even under s conditions particularly in the molecular species with methylsulfinylalkyl side chains beneficial to human health . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ and its rice homologs but no other eil genes of arabidopsis restored the sulfur limitation responseless phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ mutants suggesting uniqueness of the _PROTEIN_ subgroup members as sulfur response regulators .
we took a genetic approach to identify the key regulatory proteins controlling the upstream signaling cascades of sulfur metabolism in arabidopsis . a _METHOD_ reporter aided screening was designed to monitor the abundance of sulfate transporter in arabidopsis roots visualized as an in vivo _METHOD_ of a jellyfish green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . is a high affinity sulfate transporter in arabidopsis localized in the root hair epidermis and cortex of roots and makes a major contribution to the uptake of sulfate from the environment . the mrna accumulates under s conditions therefore a fusion gene construct _METHOD_ consisting of a bp promoter region of sulfate transporter gene and the _METHOD_ coding sequence exhibits green _METHOD_ when plants are inadequately supplied with sulfate . using this transgenic arabidopsis as a parental line ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenized seeds were generated and seedlings were screened for the changes in _METHOD_ _METHOD_ on s culture conditions . the seedlings showing reduced levels of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were isolated as mutant candidates . those showing significant reduction of _METHOD_ signals were reselected in plants and populations were generated from the crosses with the parental plants . a family of allelic mutants with cosegregating recessive mutations was chosen for further analysis and named _PROTEIN_ after their sulfur limitation responseless phenotypes . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants almost completely lacked the _METHOD_ signals of _METHOD_ that should be normally observed in the parental plants on s media . commensurate with the abnormality of _METHOD_ reporter _PROTEIN_ the induction of mrna under s was abolished in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . we cloned the _PROTEIN_ gene by a genetic map based strategy . single base substitutions were identified in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ causing missense mutations _PROTEIN_ and respectively in the coding region of the ethylene _PROTEIN_ gene a putative eil family transcription _PROTEIN_ whose function has not been verified . further analysis identified two additional alleles _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ showing phenotypes identical to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations were located close to the dna binding domains bd iii and bd iv of eil proteins . we further confirmed that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ by cauliflower mosaic virus promoter restores the sulfur limitation responseless phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . the _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ from the indicator construct _METHOD_ was recovered in both mutants by overexpression of _PROTEIN_ establishing the function of _PROTEIN_ in s responsive regulation of . _PROTEIN_ of mrna was also recovered in both mutants by _PROTEIN_ overexpression . _PROTEIN_ mrna was _PROTEIN_ both in roots and shoots however it was not modulated by the changes of sulfur conditions . tissue specific _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was examined in transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ signals were predominantly found in the vascular tissues of roots and hypocotyls . in roots _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ in pericycle and xylem parenchyma cells . as expected from its function as a transcription _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was localized exclusively in _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _LOCATION_ localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was not affected by sulfur availability . _PROTEIN_ played significant roles in activation of sulfate uptake and proper growth under s environment . for the sulfate uptake analysis plants were grown on media containing sulfate and uptake of sulfate was measured under the same sulfur condition . the results indicated that high affinity sulfate uptake activity is reduced by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations . by contrast overexpression of _PROTEIN_ restored these defects in the _PROTEIN_ mutants . these results suggested that _PROTEIN_ is required for the s responsive induction of the high affinity sulfate transport system facilitated by sulfate transporter in arabidopsis roots . we further demonstrated the significance of _PROTEIN_ in proper management of plant growth under the s environment . plants were germinated and grown on media with no external addition of sulfate to induce severe s stress . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ alleles showed reduction of root growth compared with the parental line . the observed growth defects were recovered by overexpression of _PROTEIN_ . to characterize downstream genes whose transcripts are affected by _PROTEIN_ mutation parental line and _PROTEIN_ mutants were grown on or media for d and their root rnas were hybridized with affymetrix _PROTEIN_ genechip arrays . rna was prepared from two separate cultures to have biological duplicates for each plant line under and conditions respectively . detailed procedures of data analysis are described in methods . briefly after per _PROTEIN_ normalizations each gene was normalized by that gene 's _PROTEIN_ level in the control sample . the s responsive genes were selected from the parental line data by student 's t test . the normalized values of samples of s responsive genes were compared between the parental line and _PROTEIN_ mutants to select _PROTEIN_ dependent genes showing statistically significant differences under one way analysis of variance test with benjamini and hochberg multiple testing correction and tukey post hoc test . supplemental table online represents the list of s responsive _PROTEIN_ dependent genes selected under these statistical tests . figure is a simplified presentation of these genes visualizing differences of s responses between the parental line and _PROTEIN_ mutants . the results indicated that several _METHOD_ of sulfate transporters were upregulated by sulfur limitation more significantly in the parental line than in both _PROTEIN_ mutants . and play important roles in sulfate acquisition and transport under s environment . a putative thioglucosidase showing clear s response and _PROTEIN_ dependency is suggested to be involved in hydrolytic degradation of _PROTEIN_ for catabolic sulfur recycling . around the pathways of cys synthesis an s inducible isoform of ser acetyltransferase showed a similar _PROTEIN_ profile . in addition the wild type response of other s upregulated genes with unknown functions was generally abolished in _PROTEIN_ mutants the exceptions were _METHOD_ family protein and putative pectinesterase . the changes of transcript levels of putative thioglucosidase and were confirmed by quantitative real time rt pcr showing reproducible _PROTEIN_ profiles of s responsiveness and _PROTEIN_ dependencies . another remarkable shift of transcriptome by _PROTEIN_ mutation was observed in _PROTEIN_ synthesis . they were downregulated by sulfur limitation more significantly in the parental line than in the _PROTEIN_ mutants . methyl alkylmalate synthases _PROTEIN_ and a putative branched chain amino acid aminotransferase for met chain elongation cytochrome for indole _PROTEIN_ biosynthesis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a regulator of indole _PROTEIN_ biosynthetic genes showed these patterns . adenylylsulfate kinase _PROTEIN_ which provides phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate for _PROTEIN_ biosynthesis and a sulfate assimilation enzyme _PROTEIN_ sulfurylase _PROTEIN_ were also found in this category . on real time rt pcr quantification the transcripts of a putative branched chain amino acid aminotransferase _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were lowered by _PROTEIN_ mutations under conditions . by contrast they were slightly more abundant in the _PROTEIN_ mutants than in the parental line under conditions . in addition cytochrome _PROTEIN_ which catalyzes aldoxime formation in the pathway of chain elongated met derived _PROTEIN_ biosynthesis was regulated under the same scheme . a reduction step catalyzed by adenylylsulfate reductase _PROTEIN_ is important for sulfur assimilation and transcripts for the three _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulate under s conditions . this microarray data indicated s responsive accumulation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts in the parental line though they were equally responsive to sulfur limitation in the _PROTEIN_ mutants . the results likely indicate that _PROTEIN_ is regulated independent of _PROTEIN_ . metabolite analysis emphasized appreciable contribution of _PROTEIN_ mediated regulation to sulfur assimilation and metabolism . sulfate cys glutathione met and o acetylserine were measured in parental line and _PROTEIN_ mutants grown on or media . the most significant changes were observed in oas and gsh contents in shoots . compared with the parental line the _PROTEIN_ mutants on media showed overaccumulation of oas and significant _PROTEIN_ of gsh in shoots . in roots oas content was lower in _PROTEIN_ than in the parental line under conditions but a severer s condition induced higher accumulation of oas in both _PROTEIN_ mutants . under the same s condition _PROTEIN_ mutations caused a slight _PROTEIN_ and increase of sulfate pools in shoots and roots respectively . in addition cys content was lowered but met content was increased in shoots by _PROTEIN_ mutations under conditions . the effects of _PROTEIN_ mediated regulation on secondary sulfur metabolism were evaluated by measuring the _PROTEIN_ contents . as indicated by the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ methylsulfinylalkyl _PROTEIN_ contents were significantly _PROTEIN_ by sulfur limitation in the parental line . by contrast substantial amounts of these met derived _PROTEIN_ were accumulated in _PROTEIN_ mutants even under conditions . these patterns were generally the same in roots for the molecular species with longer alkyl side chains . methylthioalkyl _PROTEIN_ contents were modulated exactly the same as in the case of methylsulfinylalkyl _PROTEIN_ a significant _PROTEIN_ by sulfur limitation was observed in both shoots and roots of the parental line but these changes were moderated in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . indole _PROTEIN_ contents were also regulated by _PROTEIN_ in roots as in the case of met derived species however in shoots they _PROTEIN_ by sulfur limitation in both _PROTEIN_ mutants and the parental line . in the arabidopsis genome six genes are annotated to encode the eil family proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is a transcription _PROTEIN_ controlling the _PROTEIN_ of ethylene responsive genes and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are the closest functional homologs of _PROTEIN_ . on the contrary the functions of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and have not yet been verified . to assess whether _PROTEIN_ is the only form specialized for sulfur response other eil family members from arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and were overexpressed in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . the results clearly indicated that _PROTEIN_ is the only form able to restore the s responsive _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ from the _METHOD_ indicator construct in _PROTEIN_ backgrounds . none of the other arabidopsis eil proteins showed the same function . the alignment and phylogenetic analysis of eil family proteins indicated that _PROTEIN_ proteins are ubiquitously found in the plant kingdom . arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ two rice homologs os _PROTEIN_ and os _PROTEIN_ and proteins from petunia and fagus sylvatica formed a unique branch that can be distinguished from other group members . os _PROTEIN_ and os _PROTEIN_ were overexpressed in _PROTEIN_ mutants and were demonstrated to have capabilities to restore the _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ from the _METHOD_ indicator construct in arabidopsis in response to sulfur limitation . these results strongly suggested that proteins in the _PROTEIN_ subgroup are functionally distinct from other eil family members mediating ethylene responses and may have unique functions in regulating sulfur responses in various plant species .
