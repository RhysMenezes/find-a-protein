_PROTEIN_ is a chloroplast protein essential for embryo development the function of which is unknown . a two hybrid interaction screen was performed to provide insight into the role of _PROTEIN_ . a single interacting partner _PROTEIN_ was identified among a cdna library from immature siliques . the _PROTEIN_ gene encodes a protein containing five ankyrin repeats very similar to _PROTEIN_ . protein truncation series demonstrated that both proteins interact through their ankyrin domains . using reverse genetics we showed that loss of akr function resulted in an embryo defective phenotype indistinguishable from the _PROTEIN_ phenotype . transient _PROTEIN_ of the signal peptide of _PROTEIN_ fused to green _METHOD_ protein demonstrated the chloroplast localization of _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ promoter was used to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in a seed specific manner in order to analyse the post embryonic effect of _PROTEIN_ loss of function in akr/akr seedlings . homozygous fertile and viable akr/akr plants were obtained . these plants exhibited mild to severe defects in chloroplast and leaf cellular organization . we conclude that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are involved in crucial and tightly controlled events in _LOCATION_ differentiation linked to cell differentiation morphogenesis and organogenesis during the plant life cycle .
we previously described the essential role of the _PROTEIN_ protein in embryo and chloroplast development . homozygous _PROTEIN_ embryos are arrested at the globular stage . analysis of the _PROTEIN_ protein sequence revealed a prominent c terminal ankyrin domain composed of five _PROTEIN_ repeats . _PROTEIN_ are known to function as protein protein interaction domains . to obtain further insight into the function of _PROTEIN_ we used the yeast two hybrid screen to search for proteins interacting with _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ protein lacking the chloroplast targeting signal peptide was fused to the activation domain to serve as bait . nineteen cdna clones were identified among a cdna library constructed with rna from immature siliques . these positive clones corresponded to transcription products of the same gene . blast searches in databases identified the gene as _GENE_ which codes for _PROTEIN_ the protein most similar to _PROTEIN_ . series of truncations of each protein were performed to define the interacting domains of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the results presented in figure demonstrate that the two proteins bind through their _PROTEIN_ domains and that binding is independent of the type of domains used for the fusion . however binding was more efficient when the amino acids of exon ii upstream of the _PROTEIN_ domain were present . when the _PROTEIN_ domain of _PROTEIN_ was reduced to three repeats the interaction with _PROTEIN_ was abolished . as the _PROTEIN_ domains of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are the most similar among the family of arabidopsis proteins containing _PROTEIN_ repeats we tested whether _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ could form homodimers . no homodimerizations of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ were observed . the latter result indicates that these two proteins possess specific amino acids that distinguish their _PROTEIN_ domain . searching in databases for homologues of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in other species may identify these key amino acid residues . using the _PROTEIN_ sequence at least ests belonging to different plant species could be recovered . when the conceptual translation of these ests contained an ankyrin domain in two thirds of cases it was associated with a partial n terminal sequence similar to the _PROTEIN_ n terminus ruling out the possibility of being an orthologue of _PROTEIN_ or of an _PROTEIN_ protein with no relationship to _PROTEIN_ . putative _PROTEIN_ orthologues could be identified only in higher plants and none was detected in animals or _METHOD_ . even among photosynthetic species including cyanobacteria eukaryotic unicellular algae or mosses no similar sequence was found . the _PROTEIN_ gene therefore appears to be restricted to the angiosperm and gymnosperm lineages . studies with the _PROTEIN_ sequence revealed a similar higher plant specific distribution . in _METHOD_ where sufficient sequence data were available both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were detected . the alignment of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and their putative orthologues is shown in figure . although no similarity could be detected between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in their n terminal part conservation of some residues in the immediate vicinity of the ankyrin domain encoded by exon ii does exist and these amino acids were included in the alignment in figure . residues that were similar between atakrp and are also conserved between their putative orthologues and belong mostly to the consensus of the ankyrin domain . some residues were conserved only among the _PROTEIN_ proteins others in the _PROTEIN_ proteins . despite the _PROTEIN_ that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ share a high degree of similarity and are clustered together in a single clade the specific residues together with the n terminal regions could confer properties and functions unique to the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ protein . this idea is consolidated further by the interaction of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the absence of homodimerization and the lethal phenotype of _PROTEIN_ loss of function . as _PROTEIN_ is localized in the chloroplast we wanted to test whether this is also the case for its interacting partner _PROTEIN_ . constructions were designed to fuse the _PROTEIN_ sequence to green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . however further characterization of the _PROTEIN_ transcript was necessary before its utilization . citation reported the first sequence of the _PROTEIN_ mrna in the landsberg ecotype . these authors translated the longest orf of the messenger rna into a protein of amino acids and suggested that _PROTEIN_ was located in the _LOCATION_ based on sequence similarities . however the putative _PROTEIN_ initiation codon in the _PROTEIN_ sequence in landsberg was substituted by _PROTEIN_ in the columbia genomic sequence and was not included in the full length _PROTEIN_ mrna sequence in columbia . thus the _PROTEIN_ gene in encodes a protein of amino acids which lacked the first amino acids of the original landsberg sequence but gained amino acids at the c terminus due to the position of the stop codon at the end of the last _PROTEIN_ repeat . with this new protein sequence the bioinformatic tools predicted a putative signal peptide of amino acids directing _PROTEIN_ to _LOCATION_ . in addition two different gene products for _PROTEIN_ are predicted at the arabidopsis information resource website . _GENE_ produces a protein of amino acids containing five _PROTEIN_ repeats _GENE_ a splice variant would code for a protein of amino acids with an _PROTEIN_ domain lacking the last two repeats . as the alternative splicing occurs at the end extremity of the mrna both gene products are presumably targeted to the chloroplast . we tested this hypothesis by fusing _METHOD_ to the c terminus of either the signal peptide or the two atakrp proteins . these constructs were introduced into tobacco leaf cells by particle bombardment and _PROTEIN_ of the fusion proteins was determined in the guard cells and epidermal cells which contain photosynthetically active chloroplasts . _PROTEIN_ was used as a positive control for chloroplast localization . a typical bombarded guard cell showed a co localization of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the chlorophyll _METHOD_ signals . similar results were obtained when the first amino acids of _PROTEIN_ were fused to _METHOD_ . this result confirmed the existence of a signal peptide for targeting _PROTEIN_ to the chloroplasts . however when the entire _PROTEIN_ protein or the variant protein vakrp was fused to _METHOD_ the _PROTEIN_ of either fusion protein was deleterious to the chloroplasts . guard cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ contained several small structures emitting both the red chlorophyll _METHOD_ and the _METHOD_ signal and are shown in figure f. figure i shows a close up of these structures which were absent in sp _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ bombarded cells . a similar effect of overexpression of the full length _PROTEIN_ protein on chloroplasts was observed in epidermal cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ n . typical images of epidermal cells of tobacco leaves _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein are shown in figure p and compared with sp _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in figure _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in figure and atdefective _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in figure . the _METHOD_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ was clearly different from the labelling of the _METHOD_ fused to the signal peptide only or to _PROTEIN_ and atdcl markers of chloroplasts . we analysed the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the major plant organs by rt pcr in comparison with the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the same samples . transcripts of both genes were detected in all tissues . in contrast to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ at higher levels in roots than in leaves . two bands were obtained for _PROTEIN_ and sequenced . the variant mrna contained the unspliced fifth intron as predicted . western blot experiments were performed to analyse the correlation between transcription and translation of the _PROTEIN_ gene . antibodies were raised against the specific portion of _PROTEIN_ protein the n terminal moiety from aa and used to determine the occurrence and abundance of the protein in different plant tissues . three bands were detected with the _PROTEIN_ antibodies . the band at kda may represent the precursor of _PROTEIN_ before removal of the signal peptide . the lower band the size of which corresponded to the truncated _PROTEIN_ was found predominantly in flower buds and siliques although we can not rule out the possibility of its being a proteolytic degradation of the full length _PROTEIN_ . the band at kda corresponded to the mature form of _PROTEIN_ with five _PROTEIN_ repeats . this protein accumulated predominantly in leaves and inflorescence _METHOD_ and this result correlated with the rt pcr data . if _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interaction has a functional significance we expect akr and _PROTEIN_ mutants to display some mutant features in common . the function of the _PROTEIN_ gene was investigated by reverse genetics . two independent t dna akr alleles _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were identified in the seedgenes database . allelic tests were performed by meinke 's group and demonstrated that loss of _PROTEIN_ function was responsible for the embryo defective phenotype . _PROTEIN_ was used further in this study and hereafter named the akr allele . akr mutant embryos are characterized by a developmental arrest at the globular stage . at _PROTEIN_ globular stage akr embryos already showed slightly swollen cells compared with the wild type although a clear difference between wild type and mutant embryos appeared at the transition from radial to bilateral symmetry . when wild type embryos reached the mature stage akr mutants never developed cotyledons but did grow radially . cytological observations revealed that there was no easily recognizable tissue organization in _PROTEIN_ akr mutants . in contrast endosperm cellularization proceeded normally with the same developmental timing as in the wild type although the akr mutant embryos were still blocked at the globular stage . we examined the ultrastructure of _LOCATION_ in akr embryos . wild type cells of the globular embryo contain undifferentiated proplastids while _LOCATION_ of the endosperm tissue appeared more differentiated with a few _LOCATION_ . at wild type torpedo stage coincident with the greening of the seed _LOCATION_ of both the embryo proper and the endosperm exhibited grana and two to four starch granules . the starch accumulation was more intense in the endosperm than in the embryo . in the akr seed at wild type torpedo stage _LOCATION_ were poorly differentiated with few internal _LOCATION_ . by these criteria akr _LOCATION_ were similar to _LOCATION_ of wild type embryos at the globular stage . however _LOCATION_ of akr mutants accumulated starch similarly to wild type torpedo seeds . the _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ embryo and endosperm cells were indistinguishable from those in akr cells . these observations suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are required for normal _LOCATION_ differentiation but not for starch accumulation . to assess _PROTEIN_ function during vegetative growth a complementation experiment was undertaken using the seed specific _PROTEIN_ promoter driving the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ cdna encoding a protein of amino acids . six independent primary transformants were studied during three to four successive generations . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transgene was able to complement the akremb phenotype as the siliques contained significantly less than emb seeds . the seeds when sown on germinating medium without antibiotic produced wild type seedlings and seedlings with abnormal morphology . abnormal seedlings classified a c according to the severity of defects were shown to be homozygous for the akr mutation . rt pcr with rna extracted from class a c seedlings confirmed the absence of _PROTEIN_ transcripts while the _PROTEIN_ transcripts were present at a level similar to the wild type . we concluded that lack of _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ does not affect the transcription of the gene encoding its _PROTEIN_ partner . aestimated by antibiotic selection and pcr . based on the non complementation ratio of . ratios are significantly different when > . class a first rosette leaves small and white b rosette leaves display both white and green areas c rosette leaves present only very small white areas . class a akr seedlings were the most affected . on germination cotyledons were green and phenotypically wild type but the first two leaves were small misshapen and white with small green patches . class b seedlings displayed rosette leaves that contained white and green patches . class c seedlings were able to form rosette leaves with limbs composed of green and yellow patches . growth and development of the seedlings correlated with the extent of green areas . class a seedlings achieved their development with the first two leaves . class b and c seedlings produced a rosette . in some cases for class b and for all cases of class c plants were able to produce flowers . floral defects were observed in class b plants and included depigmentation of sepals malformation of organs and reduced fertility . plants from class c produced siliques of normal size and seed number . for classes b and c the lines could be _PROTEIN_ as homozygous akr/akr . some arrests at globular torpedo stages of seed development were observed in siliques from class b plants . in class c most of the seeds were green and apparently fully developed . when the seeds were examined more thoroughly the majority presented morphological defects . cotyledons were often misshapen while the hypocotyl and root meristem were mostly normal . the surface of the cotyledons was irregular and wavy indicating defects in tissue and cell organization . by complementation using the promoter homozygous akr/akr plants were also obtained though the complementation was not complete . mild to severe leaf defects were observed in akr/ and akr/akr seedlings . the phenotype ranged from reduction of chlorophyll content usually in a patchy pattern reminiscent of partially complemented akr plants to abnormal leaf morphology . as these defects were observed in the progeny of the three independent lines this phenotype was probably due to ectopic and/or overexpression of _PROTEIN_ rather than a co suppression event . as some depigmented arabidopsis mutants exhibit defects in leaf tissue organization we examined the leaf sections of akr/akr _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . a typical leaf of each class is represented in figure figure represents a wild type leaf . in each mutant class the _PROTEIN_ of the leaf was increased significantly in comparison with the wild type . white areas of class a and class b leaves were severely disorganized with large intercellular spaces and a reduced number of mesophyll cells while the epidermis palisade and spongy mesophyll layers were still recognizable in class c plants . however the greater blade _PROTEIN_ in class c plants was also due to an increase in cell diameter and a _PROTEIN_ in cell contact . the number of _LOCATION_ in the large cells of mutant leaves did not appear to be reduced significantly indicating that _LOCATION_ were not defective in division . we concluded that the lack of _PROTEIN_ affects cell division cell shape cell adhesion and differentiation . the ultrastructures of _LOCATION_ from wild type leaves and white sectors of class a plants are presented in figure p. _LOCATION_ in white sectors although they did not contain chlorophyll like the proplastids found in globular embryo cells or akr/akr embryos were larger than proplastids . lamellae were clearly visible and similar to those found in chloroplasts but no grana stacks were present .
