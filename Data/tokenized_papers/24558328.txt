cellulose synthase like genes are believed to encode enzymes for the synthesis of cell wall _PROTEIN_ polysaccharides . the subfamily of csla is putatively involved in the biosynthesis of mannans . here we report a study on the cellular localization and the enzyme activity of an arabidopsis csla family member _PROTEIN_ . we show that the _METHOD_ protein fusion _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaf protoplasts is synthesized in the _LOCATION_ and it accumulates in the _LOCATION_ stacks . the chimera is inserted in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and is functional since _LOCATION_ preparations obtained by transformed protoplasts carry out the in vitro synthesis of a mannan starting from gdp d mannose as substrate . the enzyme specific activity is increased by approximately in the transformed protoplasts with respect to wild type . preliminary tests with proteinase k biochemical data and tm domain predictions suggest that the catalytic site of _PROTEIN_ faces the _LOCATION_ lumen .
a c terminal fusion of the full length coding region of _PROTEIN_ to the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ was constructed and transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaf protoplasts to investigate its subcellular localization . laser confocal scanning microscopy revealed _METHOD_ in a cortical reticulate network and some high mobile punctate structures suggesting the chimera localization in the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ compartments . treatment with brefeldin a a lipophilic fungal toxin known to induce disassembly of the _LOCATION_ stacks among other effects _PROTEIN_ determined the aggregation of the punctate structures and during time the redistribution of the _METHOD_ into the tubular and cortical network . this suggested that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ may be localized in the _LOCATION_ stacks . to further demonstrate this localization the chimera was coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a trans _LOCATION_ stack marker _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . a complete colocalization of the green and red _METHOD_ was observed evidencing that both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ accumulated in the _LOCATION_ stacks . the final localization of the chimera in the _LOCATION_ stacks was also confirmed by treating _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transiently transformed protoplasts with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide . after h of treatment the punctate structures were the only _METHOD_ compartments evidenced . altogether these data demonstrate that _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ protein is cotranslationally inserted into _LOCATION_ to further reach the _LOCATION_ apparatus which represents its stable localization . the presence of the chimera in the intracellular protein fraction including the endomembrane system was confirmed by immunoblot analyses of protein extracted from the transformed protoplasts using an anti _METHOD_ antibody . the protein band shows the expected molecular _METHOD_ of kda . a very small amount of the chimera was detected in the protein fraction of the medium . the amino acid sequence analysis of the _PROTEIN_ cdna product predicted a polypeptide of aa showing four tm domains and two hydrophilic regions between the first and second and the third and fourth tm domains . to ascertain the insertion of the chimera into the lipid bilayer its solubility in the nonionic detergent triton x was analysed . after extraction and phase separation of the total _PROTEIN_ transformed protoplast proteins the major percentage of the chimera was detected in the detergent phase confirming that it was an integral _LOCATION_ protein . _PROTEIN_ is a member of arabidopsis csla gene family encoding for a putative mannan synthase . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was functional in tobacco protoplasts we tested its enzymatic activity isolating the total _LOCATION_ fraction from the homogenates of wild type and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transiently transformed protoplasts and incubating them in the presence of gdp d mannose as substrate . after min the radioactivity incorporated in the ethanol precipitated product was measured and the enzymatic activity associated with the _LOCATION_ was calculated . radioactive polymers were synthesized either from wild type or transformed protoplasts . polymers were immobile when electrophoresed in acetic acid/formic acid buffer and were not eluted from whatman no . paper after several washing either with or with mixtures of chloroform methanol and chloroform methanol water . total acid hydrolysis and mannanase treatment of the polymers released only mannose as radioactive sugar . no other radioactive sugars were detected when the incubation medium was analysed for the presence of a gdp mannose epimerase activity . these results demonstrated the presence of a mannosyl transferase activity in tobacco leaf protoplasts and an appreciable highly statistically significant increase of this activity approximately in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transformed protoplasts indicating that the inserted chimera functions properly in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . based on tm domain prediction _PROTEIN_ active site should face the _LOCATION_ lumen . to ascertain this hypothesis mannan synthase activity was tested in the presence of proteinase k with or without triton x . the enzymatic activity was drastically reduced _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ when _LOCATION_ were permeabilized with detergent during proteinase k treatment . the results indicate that the catalytic site of _PROTEIN_ faces the lumen of the _LOCATION_ stacks according to bioinformatic predictions . a hypothetical model of the polypeptide topology based on the locations of the predicted tm domains is reported in .
