bax inhibitor is a widely conserved cytoprotective protein localized in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . we identified arabidopsis cytochrome as an interactor of arabidopsis bi by screening the arabidopsis cdna library with the split ubiquitin yeast two hybrid system . is an electron transfer protein localized _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in addition a bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation assay and _METHOD_ resonance energy transfer analysis confirmed that atbi interacted with in plants . on the other hand we found that the atbi mediated suppression of cell death in yeast requires saccharomyces cerevisiae fatty acid hydroxylase which had a like domain at the n terminus and interacted with atbi . is a sphingolipid fatty acid hydroxylase localized in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in contrast _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which are functional homologues in arabidopsis had no like domain and instead interacted with in plants . these results suggest that atbi interacts with _PROTEIN_ via in plant cells . furthermore the overexpression of atbi increased the level of hydroxy fatty acids in arabidopsis indicating that atbi is involved in fatty acid hydroxylation .
to investigate the molecular function of atbi we attempted to identify its interactors . when we screened the arabidopsis cdna library with the split ubiquitin yeast two hybrid system was isolated as a candidate for interaction . is a ubiquitous electron transport protein found in yeasts animals and plants . basic local alignment search tool sequence analyses in arabidopsis identified five putative _METHOD_ and one like protein _PROTEIN_ that had significant similarities to yeast . they all contain a heme binding motif as a conserved feature of the family protein . have a single transmembrane domain at their c terminus like yeast whereas _PROTEIN_ has one at its n terminus . moreover is well known as a tail anchored _LOCATION_ protein that is exposed to the _LOCATION_ possesses a single transmembrane domain and tail regions located near the c terminus and is known to regulate intracellular localization . in arabidopsis d is localized in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ whereas a is localized in the chloroplast envelope or mitochondrial outer _LOCATION_ . furthermore the c terminal sequences of b c and e as well as d resembled those of a b and c in tung the localization of which has been defined as the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ both in vitro and in vivo suggesting that b c d and e could be localized in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to examine whether other family proteins interacted with atbi the analysis was performed . pmet atbi nui myc and nui _PROTEIN_ myc were used as bait and prey constructs respectively . in the system used in this study only yeast cells containing interactors survive on the plate including fluoroorotic acid because the protein _PROTEIN_ by the gene in the bait vector is disrupted by the effect of full length ubiquitin . as shown in figure all interacted with atbi although _PROTEIN_ did not . to further ascertain the interaction between atbi and we divided b into an n terminal _LOCATION_ region and a c terminal transmembrane tail region and tested the interaction with atbi . as demonstrated in figure it was seen that atbi interacted only with bn suggesting that atbi interacts with on the _LOCATION_ side of the _LOCATION_ . in the next step we confirmed the interaction between atbi and in plant cells by bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation assay . the pspyne and pspyce vectors contain _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ in the c terminal side of target proteins respectively . thus we used bn in this experiment because the topology of the c terminus of b is different from that of atbi pspyne bn and pspyce atbi were constructed and were co _PROTEIN_ in nicotiana benthamiana leaves by agrobacterium infiltration . as shown in figure and c strong _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in the cell periphery and the perinuclear region in a combination of pspyne bn and pspyce atbi . in contrast pairwise _PROTEIN_ of empty vectors induced no _METHOD_ signal . these results indicate that atbi interacts with bn in n. benthamiana cells . next we attempted to detect the interaction between atbi and full length b in plant cells . fusion constructs of atbi and b were generated using genes encoding _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . atbi _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ b when co bombarded in onion epidermal cells co localized in the cell periphery and the perinuclear region . in addition _METHOD_ b showed a _LOCATION_ network confirming that b was localized in the _LOCATION_ . then we examined the interaction with _METHOD_ resonance energy transfer acceptor photobleaching analysis . the mean fret efficiency was for the combination of atbi _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ b whereas a low level fret signal was recorded in control experiments _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . in addition to bifc assay these results revealed that atbi physically interacts with the full length of b in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of plant cells . is related to fatty acid synthesis in processes such as hydroxylation desaturation and elongation . however direct evidence of involvement in the regulation of cell death has not been reported to date . to investigate the role of in the atbi mediated suppression of cell death we used yeast mutants deficient in the gene and several related genes _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . previous studies demonstrated that the _PROTEIN_ of atbi in yeast suppressed bax induced cell death . we then evaluated the suppression activity of atbi against bax induced cell death in these mutants . the wild type yeast line and mutants co transformed with bax and atbi showed almost the same sensitivity against bax induced cell death . as shown in figure b most mutants including the deficient mutant co _PROTEIN_ bax and atbi survived equally well in gal containing medium compared with the wt line . however the mutant lacking _PROTEIN_ failed to inhibit bax induced cell death in the presence of atbi . cytological analysis showed that the cellular _LOCATION_ localization of atbi _METHOD_ was not affected in this mutant . saccharomyces cerevisiae _PROTEIN_ is a sphingolipid very long chain fatty acid hydroxylase localized in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ that contains a like domain at the n terminus thus indicating the possibility that interacts with atbi in yeast . in _PROTEIN_ confirmed the interaction between atbi and . these results indicate that plays an important role in the atbi mediated suppression of cell death . citation reported previously that in arabidopsis _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ was homologous to and that it had fatty acid hydroxylation activity in yeast . further investigation of the _PROTEIN_ encoding genes in arabidopsis using the blast database again identified another protein called _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ that had high identity with . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ shared and amino acid sequence identities with the hydroxylase domain of respectively and were putative _LOCATION_ proteins that possessed between two and four transmembrane domains . both _PROTEIN_ like contained five conserved general motifs hx h to receive electrons which were characteristics of _LOCATION_ bound fatty acid hydroxylases whereas none of them contained any n terminal like domains . to verify that plant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complements the phenotype of the deficient yeast mutant the strain possessing bax and atbi was transformed with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . as shown in figure c atbi failed to inhibit bax induced cell death in the mutant . additional _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ in the mutant possessing both bax and atbi however restored the inhibitory activity of atbi against bax induced lethality . this result suggests that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are functionally homologous to and that the function of _PROTEIN_ is required for the atbi mediated suppression of cell death . as mentioned above both _PROTEIN_ were expected to have similar functions to . however although consists of both a hydroxylase domain and a like domain neither _PROTEIN_ nor _PROTEIN_ has a like domain . citation reported that the like domain is essential for the activation of human a homologue of . hence it is possible that _PROTEIN_ are supplied with electrons by through their direct interaction in arabidopsis . in _PROTEIN_ showed that both _PROTEIN_ interacted with b . as shown in figure when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ b were co bombarded in onion epidermal cells both signals were noted in the cell periphery and the perinuclear region . in addition _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed a _LOCATION_ network suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is also localized in the _LOCATION_ . then we attempted to detect the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and b by fret apb analysis . co _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ b yielded a mean fret efficiency of whereas control experiments involving combinations of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ showed low level fret signals indicating that _PROTEIN_ interacts with b in the _LOCATION_ of plant cells . the results above indicate that atbi interacts with _PROTEIN_ via in plant cells . accordingly atbi may influence the activity of _PROTEIN_ or the fatty acid hydroxylation . in the next step we examined hydroxy fatty acids in the total lipids of transgenic arabidopsis plants with atbi overexpression and in knock out or knock down lines . in the ox line atbi was overexpressed under the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter and no obvious phenotype was noted under general growing conditions which was similar to the overexpression lines of atbi _METHOD_ . in the ko line t dna was inserted in the atbi gene and atbi mrna was deleted completely as reported by citation . moreover in the kd line atbi was suppressed by rnai as reported previously by citation . total lipids were extracted from whole rosettes of week old plants and fatty acids were derivatized to methyl esters . hfa methyl esters were extracted by thin layer chromatography and were detected by gas chromatography _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . it is known that in arabidopsis there are thirteen hfas including a very small number of hfas such as h and h . in this study we detected six major hfas h h h h h and h . as shown in figure the levels of all hfas in the ko and kd lines were almost similar to those in the wild type . in contrast the levels of hfa excluding h in the ox line were higher than those in the wt especially in h and h . vlcfa is defined as the fatty acids that are longer than stearic acid suggesting that atbi mediates the vlcfa hydroxylation through an interaction with in arabidopsis .
