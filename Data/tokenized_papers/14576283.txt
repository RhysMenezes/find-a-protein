urea is the major nitrogen form supplied as fertilizer in agricultural plant production and also an important n metabolite in plants . because urea transport in plants is not well understood the aim of the present study was to isolate urea transporter genes from the model plant arabidopsis . using heterologous complementation of a urea uptake defective yeast mutant allowed to isolate and from a cdna library of arabidopsis . these cdnas encode channel like tonoplast intrinsic proteins _PROTEIN_ that belong to the superfamily of major intrinsic proteins . all four genes conferred growth of a urea uptake defective yeast mutant on mm urea in a phloretin sensitive and ph independent manner . uptake studies using labeled urea into _PROTEIN_ xenopus laevis oocytes demonstrated that facilitated urea transport also in a ph independent manner and with linear concentration dependency . _PROTEIN_ studies showed that and genes were up regulated during early germination and under n deficiency in roots but constitutively _PROTEIN_ in shoots . subcellular localization of green _METHOD_ protein fused attips indicated that and were targeted _PROTEIN_ to the tonoplast and other endomembranes . thus in addition to their role as water channels _PROTEIN_ transporters may play a role in equilibrating urea concentrations between different cellular compartments .
for the isolation of genes involved in urea transport a yeast complementation assay was established . the yeast mutant which is unable to grow on medium containing < mm urea as the sole n source was transformed with a cdna library from arabidopsis seedlings and transformants were screened on mm urea as the sole n source . of approximately independent transformants colonies were isolated that conferred growth complementation repeatedly after retransformation of and that were predicted to encode integral _LOCATION_ proteins . all cdnas represented four genes that belong to the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . except which encodes a _PROTEIN_ originally described as a tonoplastlocated water channel the other three _PROTEIN_ have not been functionally characterized so far . all four isolated genes complemented the growth of the yeast strain on mm urea as a sole n source however their growth rate was still weaker compared with the wild type in which the gene is functional . even on mm urea yeast transformants _PROTEIN_ still conferred growth complementation whereas the other three _PROTEIN_ did not . because yeast complementation by was weakest this gene was not further investigated . in transport studies in heterologous _METHOD_ phloretin is commonly used as an inhibitor for glc and urea transporters . relative to the wild type and _PROTEIN_ cells showed a reduced growth rate in presence of mm phloretin indicating that urea transport is sensitive to phloretin as found for urea transport mediated by mammalian aqps in oocytes . as an alternative to phloretin has been employed frequently to block aquaporin mediated transport of urea and water . however our attempt failed to find a suitable concentration that only inhibited growth of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ strains but not of the respective wild type . because growth complementation on urea by the active urea transporter _PROTEIN_ was strongly dependent on external ph the influence of ph on _PROTEIN_ mediated urea uptake in yeast was tested . however the growth rate of and _PROTEIN_ was hardly affected by raising the medium ph from to indicating that external ph had no considerable effect on urea transport in yeast when mediated by one of the isolated _PROTEIN_ . to investigate the mechanism of urea transport by the isolated _PROTEIN_ genes in more detail one of the isolated genes was heterologously _PROTEIN_ in x. laevis oocytes . in vitro synthesized mrna was micro injected into oocytes which were further incubated in choline based standard buffer solution for to d before assaying urea uptake after supply of labeled urea . because uptake of urea by water injected oocytes was low and showed no difference to noninjected oocytes noninjected oocytes served as a control . in contrast accumulation of urea in _PROTEIN_ oocytes was approximately to fold higher when oocytes were exposed to urea for min . uptake of urea into oocytes was independent of external ph between ph and . in control oocytes urea accumulation was not significantly altered by increasing ph but showed higher variability at ph . the ph independence in oocytes was in agreement with the observation that urea dependent growth complementation of _PROTEIN_ transformed yeast was unaffected by external ph . urea accumulation in _PROTEIN_ oocytes increased steeply with urea supply when external urea concentrations were shifted from to mm at ph . similar to the comparatively low increase of urea accumulation in control oocytes urea accumulation by increased linearly with external concentration . a linear concentration dependence over large substrate concentration ranges is more typical of channel mediated transport suggesting that might transport urea by a similar transport mechanism as water . to elucidate the potential physiological role of the isolated _PROTEIN_ transporters in urea transport in plants subcellular localization of and was assayed in peg transformed protoplasts derived from an arabidopsis cell culture precultured in the dark . all _PROTEIN_ proteins were c terminally linked to green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ of the fusion proteins was driven by a promoter . protoplasts transformed by the empty plasmid carrying _METHOD_ alone served as control . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of and tagged constructs in protoplasts was confined to a _PROTEIN_ in the protoplasts and to internal structures but was excluded from the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ lumen . this staining pattern was similar to that observed for the _LOCATION_ v type _PROTEIN_ subunit c . after releasing _LOCATION_ from the protoplasts by osmotic shock the _METHOD_ signal of and _PROTEIN_ localized to the tonoplast . a strong signal was also observed in the remaining _LOCATION_ and vesicles of the ruptured protoplast . in contrast _METHOD_ was hardly detectable in the tonoplast after osmotic shock but showed a strong staining of released material . thus all three _PROTEIN_ localized to various internal _LOCATION_ including the tonoplast and the image resolution and staining of intact protoplasts did not exclude _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization at same time . to investigate a potential physiological link of _PROTEIN_ mediated urea transport to plant n nutrition _PROTEIN_ analysis was performed in d old arabidopsis plants grown under axenic conditions . before harvest plants were subjected to n deficiency for or d. in roots _PROTEIN_ of was hardly detectable but appeared weakly up regulated after n starvation for d . transcript levels of and were readily detectable after preculture under high n supply but sharply _PROTEIN_ after h of n starvation . however prolonging the period of n starvation to d led to an increasing transcript accumulation of both genes . in shoots and seemed to be constitutively _PROTEIN_ and showed no response to the n treatments . could not be detected in shoots by rna gel blot analysis . taken together all three _PROTEIN_ genes clearly exhibited an n dependent transcriptional regulation in roots suggesting that the corresponding transporters might be involved in _LOCATION_ transport processes that are linked to n nutrition or n metabolism . urea transport might also occur during remobilization of n reserves in the plant . thus attip gene _PROTEIN_ was investigated in arabidopsis seedlings where n is remobilized from cotyledons and seed storage proteins to developing sinks . because attip transcripts were not well detected by rna gel blot analysis reverse transcriptase based pcr was performed using gene specific primers . to verify that equal amounts of crna were used in each pcr reaction cdna fragments of the constitutively _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gene were simultaneously amplified by pcr . in total rna isolated from water germinated seedlings over a d period a steep increase in transcripts of all three attip genes was observed between the and d of germination and between the and d . from the d onwards _PROTEIN_ of and remained constantly high whereas mrna levels _PROTEIN_ . a similar _PROTEIN_ pattern was only observed for encoding a _LOCATION_ gln synthetase whereas atureg and arginase showed a more or less constitutive _PROTEIN_ over the d of germination . a continuous increase in transcript levels of and during the first d of n starvation was found repeatedly . based on the well characterized transcriptional regulation of which is strongly derepressed under n deficiency it is most likely that the arabidopsis seedlings started early to suffer from n deficiency and then upregulated n dependent genes such as . the transcriptional coregulation of the three attips with other n dependent genes may support a physiological relationship between these _PROTEIN_ and n nutrition or n metabolism in arabidopsis . because all three attip genes were apparently not coregulated with the arginase gene or with _PROTEIN_ encoding a urease accessory protein no evidence has been obtained for an involvement of _PROTEIN_ in n remobilization processes when n is recycled from the orn cycle and arg is broken down to urea .
the _PROTEIN_ gene in the yeast strain was deleted by homologous integration of a disruption cassette as described by liu et al . resulting in the urea uptake defective yeast strain . for the isolation of urea transporter genes was transformed with a cdna library from arabidopsis seedlings . transformants were directly plated on urea selective medium . the isolated genes are consistent with the following annotations in the database _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ at _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the orf of was amplified from a cdna library by pfu polymerase using pcr and specific primers containing a restriction site for bglii aacacaaaaacaaaaagtttttttaattttaatcaaaaaagatctatggctggagttgcctttggttc and gaatgtaagcgtgacataactaatt acatgactcgagagatcagatctttagaaatcagcagaagcaagagg . the resulting pcr product was first in vivo cloned into the yeast _PROTEIN_ vector sequenced and the sequence was verified by database comparison . then the orf was ligated into the oocyte _PROTEIN_ vector after linearization with bamhi using the bglii overhang . capped crna was transcribed from _PROTEIN_ in vitro using the mmessage mmachine kit after linearization of the plasmid with xmni . x. laevis oocytes were removed from adult female frogs by surgery and manually dissected . oocytes were defolliculated using mg ml collagenase and trypsin inhibitor for h and injected with to nl of crna . each co injection experiment was repeated multiple times . oocytes were kept after injection for to d at in solution with the following composition mm nacl mm kcl mm mm mm hepes and ml gentamycin . standard bath solutions for oocytes were also used for uptake experiments . oocytes were pooled to groups of three and incubated for min at room temperature in of the respective buffer containing labeled urea _METHOD_ . then oocytes were carefully washed five times in ml of ice cold buffer with fold excess urea and solubilized in _PROTEIN_ . after addition of ml of scintillation cocktail washed oocytes were measured in a scintillation counter . the orfs of and were amplified by pfu polymerase using the following primers with kpni cloning sites _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . pcr products were verified by sequencing and compared with the sequences in the arabidopsis database . finally the orfs were cloned into the vector in frame to a gene encoding _METHOD_ driven by a promoter . five milliliters of week old arabidopsis ecotype landsberg suspension cell culture were transferred to ml of growth medium as described by liu et al . and subcultured for d under dark conditions . the cell culture was centrifuged at for min and washed with ml of cell wall digestion buffer solution without digestion enzyme . protoplasts were prepared and transformed according to the protocols of merkle et al . and negrutiu et al . . after transformation the protoplasts were visualized using a confocal microscope . _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of protoplasts were disrupted by osmotic shock adding to of a mm edta and mm solution to protoplasts and after incubation for to min the _METHOD_ was investigated using the confocal microscope . arabidopsis seeds were germinated and precultured axenically in magenta boxes containing ml of nutrient solution as described by liu et al . . except for the control treatment with mm plants were subjected to n deficiency for and d before harvest . plant roots and shoots were harvested separately for total rna extraction . to obtain plant material from germinating seedlings surface sterilized seeds were placed in petri dishes and germinated in autoclaved distilled water and harvested every day during a d period . isolation of total rna and rna gel blot analysis were conducted as performed in gazzarrini et al . . the full length cdnas of the three _PROTEIN_ were used as a probe for hybridization to total rna . a rrna probe was used as a rna loading control for quantification achieved by a phosphorimager . for rt mediated pcr analysis mrnas were converted to cdnas by reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer 's protocol and cdna fragments of arginase gene _PROTEIN_ and were amplified using specific primers for the corresponding genes . to ensure that equal amounts of crna were used in each pcr reaction a cdna fragment of the constitutively _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gene was simultaneously amplified by pcr . the verification of the amplicons was made by sequencing . primers used for rt pcr were _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and tcagtaatcggtggtaggcaa _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and ttagaaatcagcagaagcaag _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and ttaattcaacaatggttgct cgt arginase _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ aac _PROTEIN_ gaaggcgtcgtgggtggg and aagtattgaaagagttccattca _PROTEIN_ and tcaagggttccagaggagt and _PROTEIN_ tccaagctgttctctccttg and gagggctggaacaagacttc . upon request all novel materials described in this publication will be made available in a timely manner for noncommercial research purposes .
