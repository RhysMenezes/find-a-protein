in contrast with animals plant cells contain multiple mobile _LOCATION_ stacks distributed over the entire cytoplasm . however the distribution and dynamics of protein export sites on the plant _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ surface have yet to be characterized . a widely accepted model for _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ transport is based on the sequential action of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ coat complexes . the _PROTEIN_ complex assembles by the ordered recruitment of _LOCATION_ components on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . here we have visualized two early components of the _PROTEIN_ machinery the small _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and its _PROTEIN_ exchanging _PROTEIN_ in live tobacco leaf epidermal cells . by in vivo confocal laser scanning microscopy and _METHOD_ recovery after photobleaching experiments we show that _PROTEIN_ cycles on mobile punctate structures that track with the _LOCATION_ bodies in close proximity but contain regions that are physically separated from the _LOCATION_ bodies . by contrast is uniformly distributed along the _LOCATION_ network and does not accumulate in these structures consistent with the _PROTEIN_ that does not become part of a _PROTEIN_ vesicle . we propose that punctate accumulation of _PROTEIN_ represents _LOCATION_ export sites _LOCATION_ . the sites may represent a combination of _PROTEIN_ coated _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ nascent _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ vectors in transit which have yet to lose their coats . _LOCATION_ can be induced by overproducing _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins but not soluble bulk flow cargos . few punctate _PROTEIN_ loci were observed that are independent of _LOCATION_ bodies and these may be nascent _LOCATION_ . the vast majority of _LOCATION_ form secretory units that move along the surface of the _LOCATION_ together with the _LOCATION_ bodies but movement does not influence the rate of cargo transport between these two organelles . moreover we could demonstrate using the drug brefeldin a that formation of _LOCATION_ is strictly dependent on a functional retrograde transport route from the _LOCATION_ apparatus .
to visualize _LOCATION_ in plant cells we have fused the yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ to the c terminus of a key component of the _PROTEIN_ machinery _PROTEIN_ . such fusions are known to preserve the integrity of the _PROTEIN_ n terminus that is crucial for its _LOCATION_ anchoring . we expected that the c terminal fusion with a _METHOD_ protein would not alter the distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ relative to endogenous _PROTEIN_ . to test the functionality of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ we determined whether this fusion protein and a _PROTEIN_ restricted mutant carrying the substitution were detected as intact fusion proteins and exhibited similar effects on protein secretion as the equivalent untagged _PROTEIN_ proteins . we transfected tobacco leaf protoplasts with the secretory marker amylase and a dilution series of either _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ p _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . figures and show that neither _PROTEIN_ nor _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ affected amylase secretion similar to previous observations demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ dosage alone does not affect the secretory pathway . by contrast the two molecules with the substitution strongly inhibited the export of the marker . protein gel blots with an anti green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ serum indicated that the _METHOD_ fusions were present as full length fusion proteins . the complete absence of degradation products and the similar inhibition profile of tagged and untagged _PROTEIN_ p rules out that proteolytic degradation fragments carrying the native _PROTEIN_ moiety were responsible for the effect . moreover _METHOD_ fusions were predominantly soluble as shown previously for untagged _PROTEIN_ . to analyze the subcellular distribution of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ transiently or stably in tobacco leaf epidermal cells . in both cases a diffuse _METHOD_ was detected in the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm surrounding variously shaped and sized organelles highlighted in negative contrast . the distribution of _METHOD_ in the cytoplasm resembled _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ except for the presence of additional bright punctate structures and _PROTEIN_ like structures . we hypothesized that a general _LOCATION_ distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ could be linked to a rapid exchange of a small quantity of this protein on the _LOCATION_ . to test if an increased availability of protein cargo could recruit _PROTEIN_ visibly at the _LOCATION_ we coexpressed two well characterized _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ markers the arabidopsis thaliana k/hdel receptor fusion _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ and a _METHOD_ fusion with the last amino acids of a rat sialyl transferase _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . these two constructs are known to traffic actively between the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ bodies . we hypothesized that epidermal cells of expanded leaves would have a relatively low secretory activity and therefore overexpression of these cargo molecules would induce a significant increase in the rate of export out of the _LOCATION_ and increased recycling of the proteins back to the _LOCATION_ . coexpression of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with either _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ resulted in a pronounced punctate appearance of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the vicinity of _LOCATION_ bodies in addition to the general cytoplasmic staining verified in cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ alone . moreover additional _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ bright punctate and _PROTEIN_ like structures were detected . both these structures did not colocalize nor move synchronously with a _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ marker . similar results were obtained with other known _LOCATION_ markers such as a _METHOD_ fusion of a sugar transporter _PROTEIN_ and mannosidase i _METHOD_ . a _METHOD_ construct coexpressed with _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ did not reveal punctate structures colocalizing with the _LOCATION_ bodies but exhibited a homogeneous _LOCATION_ stain . this control experiment demonstrates that the punctate subcellular distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was not a general feature of _METHOD_ but was as a result of the _PROTEIN_ portion of the fusion protein . we also determined that the export of these _LOCATION_ proteins is _PROTEIN_ dependent by coexpressing the dominant negative mutant _PROTEIN_ p which inhibits amylase secretion . coexpression of this construct with either _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ induces a pronounced _LOCATION_ staining of the _LOCATION_ markers . therefore cycling of both markers includes a _PROTEIN_ dependent _LOCATION_ export step . our combined results indicate that a redistribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ from the _LOCATION_ to the vicinity of _LOCATION_ bodies occurs upon overexpression of _LOCATION_ marker proteins which follow the _PROTEIN_ route to reach the _LOCATION_ bodies . this suggests that the cargo may regulate the recruitment of _PROTEIN_ at the sites of protein export and initiate _PROTEIN_ mediated transport . the close intimacy of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labeled structures and _LOCATION_ bodies prompted us to analyze the putative _LOCATION_ complex in further detail . we coexpressed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with the _LOCATION_ marker _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ optically sliced the structures highlighted by the two _METHOD_ markers at the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ complex and collected a series of micron optical sections along the z axis of the _LOCATION_ complex starting from the _LOCATION_ toward the _LOCATION_ body . the results show that the signal resulting from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ overlaps initially with that of _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ but that the ratio between the two fluorophores systematically shifts to _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . eventually the signal resulting from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ reduces to the noise value whereas the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ remains high . a control with an identical optical sectioning procedure on _LOCATION_ bodies labeled with _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ and _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ showed an even distribution of the two fluorochromes across an equivalent region . the absence of a shift in _METHOD_ signal observed in this control rules out that the possibility that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ distributions are the result of chromatic aberrations . we conclude that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labeled loci are physically distinct from the _LOCATION_ bodies and represent _LOCATION_ and will refer to these as such in the remainder of this article . our proposed transport model is attractive because _LOCATION_ export would occur when cargo is present and not as a constitutive measure . however it was now necessary to ascertain if the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at defined punctate structures could also be triggered by other cargo molecules . in particular we wanted to test the bulk flow model for _LOCATION_ export which was shown to occur at least partially via the _PROTEIN_ route . if soluble proteins exit the _LOCATION_ by bulk flow we predicted that soluble cargo should not recruit _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . for this purpose we used an _LOCATION_ targeted soluble _METHOD_ _METHOD_ that is secreted mostly into the apoplast . we also coexpressed an _LOCATION_ targeted and retained soluble _METHOD_ which accumulates in the _LOCATION_ by virtue of the _LOCATION_ retrieval signal hdel _METHOD_ . the latter should increase _LOCATION_ export even further because retrieved _METHOD_ hdel would continuously join the de novo synthesized _METHOD_ hdel . in contrast with the coexpression experiments with _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ markers the _LOCATION_ distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was not altered in cells coexpressing _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ hdel . the lack of accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in discrete punctate structures in these cells suggests that soluble cargo even when present in large quantities by the addition of an hdel tag does not visibly recruit the first key element in _PROTEIN_ dependent transport . to gain further insights on the dynamic regulation of the _LOCATION_ protein export machinery in vivo we studied the _PROTEIN_ specific guanine nucleotide exchange _PROTEIN_ . this protein is an integral _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein that regulates recruitment of _PROTEIN_ onto the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the subsequent _PROTEIN_ assembly and is excluded from _PROTEIN_ vesicles . therefore it is an excellent model protein to characterize the _LOCATION_ export process further . to visualize in the tobacco leaf system we fused _METHOD_ to the c terminus of to orient the tag in the lumen of the _LOCATION_ so as not to interfere with the functionality of the _LOCATION_ site of . overexpression of inhibits secretion likely because of titration of _PROTEIN_ . to test whether the fusion protein retains the inhibitory effect of its untagged counterpart we coexpressed untagged or _METHOD_ together with the secretory marker amylase in tobacco leaf protoplasts . figure shows that the fusion protein inhibits amylase secretion in a dose dependent manner as the untagged . the fusion protein exhibits the expected molecular _METHOD_ of kd and it was not possible to detect a degradation product . this is an essential control as it illustrates that _METHOD_ microscopy will reveal signals from the fusion protein and not degradation products which may localize differently . unlike the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion most of the _METHOD_ fusion was detected in the _LOCATION_ fraction . having established this functional aspect of the fusion protein we now wanted to investigate if is enriched at the _LOCATION_ . when transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaf epidermal cells _METHOD_ localized to the _LOCATION_ . to probe the mobility of _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ we photobleached a region of the _LOCATION_ labeled with _METHOD_ and followed the recovery of the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in that region . upon bleaching a full recovery of _METHOD_ within to s from the bleaching event occurred indicating that _METHOD_ was highly mobile in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . these data suggested that _METHOD_ may need to be distributed evenly over the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to enable rapid exchange of _PROTEIN_ at the sites of protein export that are mobile along with the _LOCATION_ bodies . to test this hypothesis we transiently coexpressed the cargos _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with low levels of _METHOD_ that have little or no effect on _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ transport but can be detected at the _LOCATION_ . this would permit us to analyze by analogy to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ whether specific recruitment of to _LOCATION_ associated _LOCATION_ could be observed in the presence of these cargo proteins . figures and show that unlike _PROTEIN_ the exchange _PROTEIN_ does not concentrate on the _LOCATION_ . under any condition and even at the lowest levels of _PROTEIN_ no localized concentration of _METHOD_ was detected . such an even distribution of on the _LOCATION_ network has also been described in saccharomyces cerevisiae and in mammalian cells but differs from the yeast p. pastoris where discrete _LOCATION_ contain _PROTEIN_ coat proteins as well as . to investigate whether the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the vicinity of _LOCATION_ bodies is dependent on active secretion and represents a dynamic steady state between recruitment and dissociation of _PROTEIN_ via vesicle budding and uncoating we blocked secretion with either bfa treatment or overexpression in leaf epidermal cells coexpressing _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . as expected bfa treatment results in the rapid absorbance of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and redistribution of _METHOD_ tagged _LOCATION_ markers into the _LOCATION_ an effect that is fully reversible . interestingly bfa treated cells also no longer recruited _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to the vicinity of _LOCATION_ bodies . however upon washout of bfa _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulated near a reformed _LOCATION_ body . thus _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ sites are intimately and dynamically associated with the presence of newly formed _LOCATION_ bodies and are disrupted by _LOCATION_ breakdown induced by bfa . interestingly upon bfa treatment the distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ appeared reticular and closely resembled the distribution of _LOCATION_ labeled with _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ in presence of bfa . overexpression of titrates _PROTEIN_ and efficiently inhibits _PROTEIN_ dependent transport . indeed cotransformation of stable transformants _PROTEIN_ either _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with high levels of _METHOD_ or untagged drastically increased accumulation of either protein in the _LOCATION_ . this is consistent with the inhibition of amylase secretion when large amounts of are produced and shows that all three proteins require _PROTEIN_ mediated transport to leave the _LOCATION_ . we now wanted to test whether inhibition of _PROTEIN_ transport by overproduction had an effect on _PROTEIN_ accumulation at _LOCATION_ . we thus coexpressed untagged together with _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in these conditions we observed that most of _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ was displaced into the _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ reduced the appearance in discrete punctate structures . these data are comparable to the results with bfa and indicate that under conditions of disruption of anterograde transport between the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ bodies _PROTEIN_ is no longer recruited to the sites of protein export . moreover upon overexpression of untagged in cells coexpressing _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ resembled an _LOCATION_ like pattern in comparison with a control . distributes at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and its overexpression titrates _PROTEIN_ . thus an increased number of molecules available for interaction with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ may account for the distribution of the _PROTEIN_ in a reticulated pattern . both methods to disrupt protein traffic between the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ apparatus led to the disappearance of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ illuminated _LOCATION_ and provide further evidence for our model . in tobacco leaves and suspension culture tobacco cells _LOCATION_ bodies move on an underlying _LOCATION_ network in an actin dependent manner . when we coexpressed _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ we found that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ bodies moved synchronously within the vicinity of _LOCATION_ stacks over the _LOCATION_ . to determine whether the putative plant _LOCATION_ highlighted with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are dependent on similar forces that move the _LOCATION_ bodies we used latrunculin b to depolymerize the actin . under these conditions movement of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ bodies was inhibited along with that of the _LOCATION_ stacks but the two structures remained colocalized . this close association of _LOCATION_ stacks with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulation and the absence of _PROTEIN_ free _LOCATION_ stacks suggest that the _LOCATION_ bodies and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ punctate structures behave as a single secretory unit that is mobile along the surface of the _LOCATION_ . the correlated movement of the _LOCATION_ bodies and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ along the surface of the _LOCATION_ suggests that _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ stacks form functional units . combined with the remainder of the data we hypothesized that increased _LOCATION_ export of _LOCATION_ cargo is associated with increased _PROTEIN_ recruitment from a _LOCATION_ pool to the _LOCATION_ system . to test this hypothesis we selectively photobleached the _METHOD_ and observed its recovery over time while simultaneously monitoring the movement of the bleached structure using unbleached cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . we cotransformed cells with _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ and _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ and specifically bleached _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . figures and show that _METHOD_ _METHOD_ recovers while _LOCATION_ bodies are moving for example while the velocity of the _LOCATION_ bodies is > . these data confirm that anterograde cargo can be delivered to moving _LOCATION_ bodies . to test the validity of our hypothesis we determined whether the _PROTEIN_ machinery is recruited during movement of the _LOCATION_ . we coexpressed _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and bleached selectively the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . using the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ as a reference we could show that the depletion of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ within the region of moving _LOCATION_ bodies is followed by a rapid recovery indicating that _PROTEIN_ can exchange on and off _LOCATION_ as these structures move in close association with the _LOCATION_ bodies along the _LOCATION_ surface . next we aimed to compare the dynamics of _PROTEIN_ recruitment from the _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ with the kinetics of _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ transport of a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker . whereas the _LOCATION_ protein can only reach the _LOCATION_ apparatus via _LOCATION_ mediated vectors the _PROTEIN_ can be recruited directly from the _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ . thus we hypothesized that _PROTEIN_ recruitment would be rapid in comparison with _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ body transport . to test this hypothesis we inhibited _LOCATION_ body and _LOCATION_ movement with latrunculin b which depolymerizes f actin as described by citation and performed _METHOD_ recovery after photobleaching experiments on static _LOCATION_ bodies and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ structures . this permitted us to quantify the exchange rate of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at the _LOCATION_ in comparison with the exchange rate of the _LOCATION_ marker . we used the and nm lines of an argon laser to simultaneously photobleach the _METHOD_ and the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and compared the _METHOD_ recovery of the two proteins . upon bleaching _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ recovered significantly more rapidly than _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ consistent with an exchange of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ with a _LOCATION_ pool . when simultaneously photobleached _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ and _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ recovered with equal kinetics _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . this result confirmed that the rates of _METHOD_ recovery are not as a result of the _PROTEIN_ of two different fluorochromes . these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ exchanges rapidly from a _LOCATION_ pool and that different cycles of _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ binding and release at the _LOCATION_ are needed for _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins to exchange an entire _LOCATION_ protein pool from the _LOCATION_ . to further characterize the dynamics of the _PROTEIN_ steady state at the plant _LOCATION_ we investigated the distribution of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ locked mutant _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ p mutant is still capable of _PROTEIN_ turnover but at a much slower rate than the wild type counterpart . it is predicted that mutant _PROTEIN_ containing _PROTEIN_ vesicles can bud but will accumulate to higher levels before fusion with the _LOCATION_ bodies because of a slow shedding of the coat that will retard fusion with the _LOCATION_ apparatus . this should result in a more pronounced visualization of a _LOCATION_ associated _LOCATION_ . to test this hypothesis we _PROTEIN_ a _METHOD_ chimaera of the _PROTEIN_ p mutant in tobacco leaf epidermal cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at low levels to _PROTEIN_ reasonable _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ transport . in these conditions cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ alone displayed numerous discrete mobile punctate structures in comparison with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ alone . this supports the prediction that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ once trapped on the sites of protein export by a slower _PROTEIN_ turnover accumulates and therefore becomes more visible even in the absence of the cargo that induces _LOCATION_ . the results also indicate that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labeled _LOCATION_ represent not only _PROTEIN_ coated _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and nascent _PROTEIN_ structures but also a localized pool of _PROTEIN_ vectors in transit . to establish whether these _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ structures localized in the vicinity of _LOCATION_ bodies and therefore mark the _LOCATION_ we _PROTEIN_ low levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . under these conditions we observed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ colocalized with _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ and moved with the _LOCATION_ bodies . this finding supports the hypothesis that _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ bodies are associated in plants . in cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ alone at higher levels the _METHOD_ of the fusion was _PROTEIN_ restricted to the _LOCATION_ with a drastic reduction of the number of punctate structures visible in low _PROTEIN_ cells suggesting that _PROTEIN_ mediated protein transport was compromised under these conditions . to confirm that _LOCATION_ export was disrupted under these conditions we transiently _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ to detect any alteration in the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ distribution pattern . as with the untagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant overexpression of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ caused disappearance of the _LOCATION_ bodies in cells coexpressing _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ and accumulation of _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ in cells coexpressing _METHOD_ . these experiments demonstrate that vesicle budding still occurs at a modest concentration of the dominant negative _PROTEIN_ . however at high concentrations of the mutant _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ are compromised possibly by a loss of other essential components which normally recycle from the _LOCATION_ apparatus back to the _LOCATION_ but are now titrated out in fusion incompetent _PROTEIN_ vectors .
standard molecular techniques were used as described by citation . the _METHOD_ proteins used in this study were based on fusions with either _METHOD_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ . the spectral properties of _METHOD_ allow efficient spectral separation from _METHOD_ . for agrobacterium tumefaciens transient _PROTEIN_ of untagged tobacco _PROTEIN_ and its _PROTEIN_ mutant we used the binary vector and we inserted the dna coding sequence of the two proteins within the unique xbai and saci sites of the vector . for a. tumefaciens transient _PROTEIN_ of the chimeric gene was inserted as an ecori fragment directly into the polylinker of the binary plant vector cut with ecori and hindiii followed by dephosphorylation . the resulting vector permits a. tumefaciens mediated plant transformation using kanamycin resistance but also works in a to d infiltration essay without selection . for a. tumefaciens transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ constructs the coding sequence of tobacco _PROTEIN_ and its _PROTEIN_ mutant and arabidopsis were inserted upstream _METHOD_ using the unique xbai and sali sites of the vector . to generate _METHOD_ hdel the coding region of a sporamin signal peptide fused in frame with _METHOD_ and hdel was inserted in between the unique xbai and saci sites of the binary vector . the primer sequences used for the subcloning indicated above are available upon request . four week old tobacco greenhouse plants grown at were used for a. tumefaciens mediated transient _PROTEIN_ . the bacterial od used for plant transformation was to for tagged and untagged versions of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant and and for _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ tagged constructs _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ hdel . for transient _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts tobacco plants were grown in _METHOD_ medium and sucrose in a controlled room at with a h h dark regime at the light irradiance of me . tobacco leaf protoplast preparation and subsequent dna transfection via electroporation were performed as described by citation and the plasmid concentrations used are given in the figures . after electroporation the protoplasts were incubated for h. after the appropriate incubation time the suspension was spun for min at in a swing out centrifuge which results in the floating of the cells . using an extrafine pasteur pipette we removed ml of clear supernatant from below the floating cell layer . the remainder of the suspension was brought to ml with mm nacl and mixed gently by inverting the tube twice . after a second spin of min at the supernatant was removed with a peristaltic pump and the cell pellet was placed on ice . the cells were extracted in a final volume of . equal volumes of cell extract and culture medium were analyzed by protein gel blotting or by enzymatic analysis . protein analysis of culture medium was performed after concentration with aqueous ammonium sulfate solution on ice using bsa at mg/ml as a carrier . the protein precipitate was then resuspended in amylase extraction buffer concentrating the culture medium samples fold compared with the original volume . cell proteins were analyzed separately as soluble phase and pelleted _LOCATION_ . the analysis of soluble cell proteins was conducted after sonication of the protoplasts in amylase extraction buffer and centrifugation for min at at . the supernatant containing the soluble proteins was recovered . the pellet containing _LOCATION_ proteins was resuspended by brief sonication . both cell protein samples were resuspended to a fold lower volume than the original cell suspension in amylase extraction buffer . protein cell extracts or concentrated medium were loaded in equal volumes after dilution with _PROTEIN_ loading buffer and boiling . protein in _PROTEIN_ polyacrylamide gels were transferred onto a nitrocellulose _LOCATION_ and then blocked with _PROTEIN_ tween and milk powder for h. the filter was then incubated in blocking buffer with primary antibody at a dilution of for the anti _METHOD_ serum and for the anti igg antibody . all the antisera were from rabbits and further steps were performed as by citation . the cells were extracted in amylase extraction buffer via sonication for s. the extracts were centrifuged min at at and the clean soluble supernatant was recovered . the culture medium was also spun min at at to remove residual cell debris . the amylase assays and calculation of the secretion index were performed as described previously . the secretion index represents the ratio between the _LOCATION_ and intracellular activity and the total activity corresponds to the sum of the activity detected in the medium and in the cells . segments of transformed leaves were used for drug treatment confocal imaging and analysis . for actin depolymerization leaf tissue was submerged in latrunculin b _METHOD_ for h. bfa _METHOD_ was used at a concentration of as described by citation . bfa washes were performed as described earlier . all stock solutions were kept at and working solutions were prepared fresh just before use . transformed leaves were analyzed h after infection of the lower epidermis . confocal imaging was performed using an inverted zeiss laser scanning microscope and an upright zeiss meta and a oil and water immersion objective . for imaging _PROTEIN_ of either _METHOD_ constructs or _METHOD_ constructs or both we used imaging setting as described by citation with a pinhole diameter . similarly coimaging of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ construct _PROTEIN_ was done according to citation . in both cases appropriate controls were done to exclude the possibility of energy transfer between fluorochromes and cross talk . in control experiments we also used _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in combination with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and obtained accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ structures in the vicinity of _LOCATION_ bodies as for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ detected in coexpression of _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ markers . time lapse scanning was acquired with imaging system software of the microscope . for optical sectioning the _LOCATION_ bodies complex the optimal diameter pinhole was determined according to the manufacturer 's instructions to produce the best signal/noise ratio and was set to airy unit _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . increments on the z axis of the _LOCATION_ complex were set at . _METHOD_ intensity measurements and postacquisition image processing were done with zeiss confocal and paintshop pro software respectively . spot photobleaching recovery measurements were performed on an inverted zeiss lsm confocal microscope . frap experiments for dual fluorochrome photobleaching and half time computation were performed as by citation . significance statistics was determined using a student 's two tailed t test for two samples assuming equal variance . as for the selective photobleaching of _METHOD_ in the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ combinations the method for selective _METHOD_ _METHOD_ bleaching was _PROTEIN_ from citation . for this we used the nm laser line of an argon laser while imaging either the _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ _METHOD_ with the argon nm laser line in cells in which the _LOCATION_ body movement was not altered by the use of any drug . a small region of interest containing one or two target structures was selected in a cell coexpressing _METHOD_ and either _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ and the _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ was bleached using a brief pulse of nm laser line . the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ intensity of the _METHOD_ of the organelles of interest was recorded before the bleaching event and in the time after the bleaching event until _METHOD_ recovery plateau was achieved . this bleaching protocol leaves the _METHOD_ resulting from either _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ unaltered . bleaching of _METHOD_ in the _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ couple allows monitoring of the _METHOD_ signal and simultaneous tracking and computation of the _METHOD_ signal recovery on a _METHOD_ labeled structure with the fast scanning multitracking facility of the confocal microscope .
