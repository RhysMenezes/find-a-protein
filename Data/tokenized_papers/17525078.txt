the _PROTEIN_ loss of function mutant which was identified by screening for arabidopsis mutant seedlings with an enhanced ethylene response has both increased sensitivity and profound exaggeration of response to ethylene when visually assessed yet exhibits partial ethylene insensitivity at the molecular level . the _PROTEIN_ mutation represents a conditional allele with an ethylene dependent phenotype that results from an amino acid substitution in the previously uncharacterized prohibitin _PROTEIN_ with complete loss of _PROTEIN_ function resulting in an extreme constitutive ethylene response in air . prohibitins in other _METHOD_ have diverse roles including transcriptional regulation with loss of prohibitin function in this capacity associated with tumour formation in mammals . subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ indicates that it is found in several cellular locations including the _LOCATION_ and throughout the cytoplasm . genetic analysis demonstrates that _PROTEIN_ functions downstream of _PROTEIN_ since an _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant has the same profound hypocotyl inhibition phenotype seen with the _PROTEIN_ mutant . based on the presented work _PROTEIN_ probably functions as a positive regulator of _PROTEIN_ of a subset of ethylene regulated genes along with a group of genes required to _PROTEIN_ growth in the presence of ethylene .
in order to isolate arabidopsis mutants with enhanced ethylene response ethylmethane sulphonate _METHOD_ mutagenized col seedlings were grown in the dark for d in the presence of ethylene after which seedlings with extreme hypocotyl shortening compared with the col wild type were isolated as putative eer mutants . following isolation putative eer mutants that showed growth comparable with the wild type in the presence of either ethylene perception or biosynthesis inhibitors yet extreme response to saturating ethylene were selected for further analysis . for this report the recessive mutant _PROTEIN_ was chosen for characterization and subsequent map based cloning of the respective mutation . initially _PROTEIN_ was compared with col wild type with _PROTEIN_ to its capacity for growth in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of exogenous ethylene . for this analysis _PROTEIN_ and col wild type seedlings were grown for d in the dark in the presence of either which is an ethylene perception inhibitor or avg which is an ethylene biosynthesis inhibitor with the latter treatment supplemented with increasing concentrations of exogenous ethylene . from this analysis it was found that in the absence of ethylene signalling as represented by treatment with the _PROTEIN_ mutant was capable of hypocotyl elongation similar to the wild type with _PROTEIN_ hypocotyls approximately the height of col wild type . addition of increasing concentrations of ethylene had a greater inhibitory effect on the elongation of _PROTEIN_ hypocotyls compared with col wild type with col wild type requiring upwards of fold higher ethylene to achieve inhibition of hypocotyl elongation compared with _PROTEIN_ . most striking was the profound difference in hypocotyl elongation when comparing col wild type with _PROTEIN_ at saturating levels of exogenous ethylene with _PROTEIN_ hypocotyls being < the height of col wild type . it should be noted that neither of these phenotypic differences could be accounted for by _PROTEIN_ overproducing ethylene since avg was included in this dose response analysis effectively limiting endogenous ethylene and the most severe phenotypic difference seen between _PROTEIN_ and col wild type occurs in the presence of saturating ethylene . in order to confirm that _PROTEIN_ is indeed ethylene hypersensitive a dose response analysis using the ethylene agonist propylene was performed . for this analysis _PROTEIN_ and col wild type seedlings were grown for d in the dark in the presence of either or avg the latter of which was supplemented with increasing concentrations of propylene . following incubation hypocotyl length was measured which revealed that _PROTEIN_ had similar growth characteristics when exposed to propylene in comparison with ethylene treatment . from this analysis it was found that the lengths of _PROTEIN_ hypocotyls were comparable with those of col wild type in the presence of with _PROTEIN_ approximately the height of col wild type . treatment with propylene revealed that there was upwards of a fold increase in the concentration of propylene required to cause inhibition of hypocotyl elongation for col wild type compared with _PROTEIN_ . finally there was a profound exaggeration of response for _PROTEIN_ compared with col wild type to saturating concentrations of propylene with _PROTEIN_ seedlings < the height of col wild type . the _PROTEIN_ mutant was also examined for additional phenotypic manifestations in other tissues . from this analysis it was found that _PROTEIN_ roots have a reduced capability to grow in an ethylene independent manner . dose response analysis with increasing concentrations of ethylene did not reveal either increased sensitivity or exaggeration of response to ethylene suggesting that the limited growth capacity found for _PROTEIN_ roots is due either to a general growth defect or to a constitutive ethylene response . additionally _PROTEIN_ mutants demonstrated a significant reduction in rosette size compared with col wild type plants . total leaf area was measured for week old col wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants and from this analysis it was determined that _PROTEIN_ adult plants are approximately smaller than col wild type plants in the absence of exogenous ethylene . in order to determine if the _PROTEIN_ mutation causes an increase in ethylene production ethylene was collected for h from d old dark grown col wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings and the collected gas was subsequently measured using a gas chromatography system . as shown in fig . it was found that _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings produce approximately four times more ethylene than col wild type although this can not be considered to be the cause of the _PROTEIN_ dark grown seedling phenotype since the aforementioned growth analyses were done in the presence of an ethylene biosynthesis inhibitor and the exaggerated phenotype for _PROTEIN_ was observed following treatment with saturating ethylene . it was also of interest to determine if the _PROTEIN_ mutation had an effect on ethylene inducible gene _PROTEIN_ with the expectation being that in conjunction with the severe effect on growth seen for the mutant there would be a concomitant increase in induction of ethylene regulated genes . for this analysis _PROTEIN_ of ethylene responsive reporter genes was assessed in both ethylene treated seedlings and leaves of _PROTEIN_ and col wild type . several genes have been reported to be excellent indicators of the ethylene response in etiolated seedlings including an acc oxidase _PROTEIN_ an ethylene receptor _PROTEIN_ and an _PROTEIN_ like transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . for this analysis col wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings were grown in the dark for d in either the presence or absence of or ethylene after which total rna was isolated from collected tissue . northern analysis revealed that for this limited sample of ethylene regulated genes the _PROTEIN_ mutation either had no effect or a deleterious effect on ethylene dependent induction of gene _PROTEIN_ . as shown in fig . ethylene treatment resulted in normal induction of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ compared with col wild type whereas both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were not up regulated in the mutant to the same level as seen for col wild type . further analysis of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in seedlings exposed to a variety of conditions including air nl ethylene and ethylene revealed a profound reduction in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant compared with col wild type in response to ethylene . ethylene responsive gene _PROTEIN_ was also assessed for _PROTEIN_ leaves using several genes that have been demonstrated to be excellent indicators of the ethylene response . the reporter genes chosen included the ethylene and ja inducible ap like transcription _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ the ethylene receptor _PROTEIN_ and the defence related genes basic chitinase and _PROTEIN_ . for this analysis week old plants of _PROTEIN_ and col wild type were exposed to either air or ethylene for h after which leaf tissue was collected for isolation of total rna . for both _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ there was no apparent difference in ethylene inducibility when comparing col wild type and _PROTEIN_ . in contrast the _PROTEIN_ mutation has a significant deleterious effect on the _PROTEIN_ of both basic chitinase and _PROTEIN_ following ethylene treatment compared with col wild type suggesting that normal _PROTEIN_ function is required for proper ethylene inducibility of these particular genes . treatment with / ja resulted in proper induction of both basic chitinase and _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ suggesting that the mutant phenotype of _PROTEIN_ is probably specific to ethylene signalling . a mapping population was generated by crossing _PROTEIN_ to ws wild type and subsequently selecting progeny that displayed exaggerated responsiveness to saturating ethylene . from this analysis _PROTEIN_ was localized to the bacterial artificial chromosome and subsequently to the gene _GENE_ which has previously been reported to encode an arabidopsis prohibitin of unknown function _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ mutation represents a single nucleotide change in the coding sequence of _GENE_ which leads to substitution of n for d at position in the _PROTEIN_ protein . total rna was isolated from arabidopsis roots leaves _METHOD_ and flowers in order to determine the tissue specific _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ . total rna was also extracted from d old dark grown col wild type seedlings treated with either or ethylene and from _PROTEIN_ seedlings treated with ethylene . _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ from low to moderate levels in all tissues tested but was not found to be ethylene inducible . the _PROTEIN_ mutation did not significantly reduce the stability of the _PROTEIN_ transcript . a genomic construct consisting of kb of the upstream promoter sequence the two exons and an intron and the was generated in and introduced into _PROTEIN_ by agrobacterium mediated transformation . glufosinate resistant progeny were subsequently analysed for growth capability in the presence of saturating ethylene with dark grown d old transgenic lines demonstrating ethylene responsive growth that was identical to col wild type instead of _PROTEIN_ indicating that the observed nucleotide change is indeed the cause of the mutant phenotype . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis did not cause any observable phenotypic changes . since it was not clear whether _PROTEIN_ represented a complete loss of function mutation it was necessary to identify a loss of function insertion allele . for this a t dna line that represented an insertion in exon of _GENE_ was obtained and homozygous progeny were generated with this line being referred to as _PROTEIN_ for the remainder of the report . growth of _PROTEIN_ for d in the dark in the presence of produced an extreme constitutive ethylene response that was identical to ethylene treated _PROTEIN_ including a pronounced apical hook thus suggesting that _PROTEIN_ represents an ethylene conditional allele since _PROTEIN_ seedlings grow relatively normally in the absence of ethylene . in the presence of ethylene the phenotypes of dark grown _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were indistinguishable with both exhibiting the same extreme ethylene response phenotype . the growth of adult _PROTEIN_ plants in the absence of exogenous ethylene was also phenotypically identical to that of _PROTEIN_ plants . northern analysis was performed to determine the effect of the t dna insertion on _PROTEIN_ of _GENE_ in _PROTEIN_ . for this analysis col wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings were grown in the dark for d after which tissue was collected for rna analysis . the t dna insertion in _PROTEIN_ was found to cause both a significant increase in _GENE_ transcript size and a reduction in transcript abundance in comparison with col wild type . northern analysis also revealed that ethylene dependent gene _PROTEIN_ patterns were altered in _PROTEIN_ similarly to _PROTEIN_ . total rna was extracted from d old dark grown col wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings treated with either or ethylene and this was used for northern analysis with the ethylene inducible gene _PROTEIN_ . from this analysis _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ following ethylene treatment was severely reduced in _PROTEIN_ compared with col wild type . gene _PROTEIN_ was also analysed for week old col wild type and _PROTEIN_ leaves that were treated with either air or ethylene for h . northern analysis focused on _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ of this being severely reduced in the _PROTEIN_ mutant compared with col wild type following ethylene treatment thus verifying that _PROTEIN_ is a bona fide loss of function allele . as part of an effort to understand the role of _PROTEIN_ in ethylene signalling double mutants were made between _PROTEIN_ loss of function mutants and mutants representing defects in known components of the ethylene signalling pathway . the _PROTEIN_ loss of function mutant has a strong constitutive ethylene response even in the absence of ethylene . because of this an _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant was constructed in order to determine if the _PROTEIN_ phenotype could be elicited in this double mutant in the absence of ethylene . for this analysis col wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings were grown in the dark in air for d after which seedling height was assessed . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant had an extreme hypocotyl inhibition phenotype that was nearly identical to ethylene treated _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is required to oppose the activation of the ethylene signalling pathway that arises upon loss of _PROTEIN_ function . additionally there was a moderate reduction in the size of adult _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants compared with either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ loss of function mutation results in complete ethylene insensitivity due to a lesion in _PROTEIN_ which encodes a component required for propagation of an ethylene signal . in order to determine if the _PROTEIN_ mutation is epistatic to the _PROTEIN_ mutation an _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant was constructed and it was assessed as to whether the _PROTEIN_ mutation can mask the severe constitutive ethylene response associated with the _PROTEIN_ mutation . col wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings were grown in the dark in air for d after which seedlings were assessed for presentation of a severe triple response phenotype . as shown in fig . whereas seedlings of col wild type and _PROTEIN_ had long hypocotyls in air both _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant had the extreme hypocotyl shortening phenotype associated with _PROTEIN_ . since _PROTEIN_ represents a mutation that results in complete blockage of ethylene signalling this indicates that _PROTEIN_ functions at or below _PROTEIN_ in this pathway . the _PROTEIN_ mutation which is a loss of function mutation in the gene encoding the transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ results in partial ethylene insensitivity in etiolated seedlings . an _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant was constructed in order to determine if the _PROTEIN_ mutation could block the manifestation of the extreme constitutive ethylene response phenotype seen for _PROTEIN_ in air . for this analysis col wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings were grown in the dark in air for d after which hypocotyl length was assessed . as shown in fig . the _PROTEIN_ mutation was incapable of blocking manifestation of the _PROTEIN_ phenotype in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant suggesting that _PROTEIN_ functions at or below the level of _PROTEIN_ mediated transcription in the ethylene signalling pathway . in order to determine the subcellular location of _PROTEIN_ a translational fusion between _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was constructed and the localization of this was compared with that of _METHOD_ alone _METHOD_ . leaves of n. benthamiana were infiltrated with agrobacterium carrying either _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and after d samples were examined for _METHOD_ using a confocal microscope . analysis revealed a normal pattern of cytoplasmic _METHOD_ for _METHOD_ with little or no signal within the _LOCATION_ . for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was widely distributed throughout the epidermal cells _PROTEIN_ this fusion protein including large patches throughout the cytoplasm along with areas within and surrounding the _LOCATION_ as demonstrated by counterstaining with dapi . this type of complex pattern of localization is consistent with what has been reported for prohibitins in other biological _METHOD_ .
for all seedling growth experiments seeds were surface sterilized and cold stratified at for d in the dark to synchronize germination . seeds were then suspended in agarose and sown on pns medium . for triple response experiments the medium was supplemented with either or aminoethoxyvinylglycine as required . ethylene and propylene dose response analyses along with analysis of jasmonic acid responsiveness were all done as previously described . all adult plants in this study were grown in soil under a h light cycle at in a plant growth room supplemented with sylvania gro lite _METHOD_ bulbs . for treatment of leaves for rna extraction adult plants were grown for weeks in air and then treated with either air or ethylene in an airtight chamber for h. immediately after treatment leaf tissue was collected and quick frozen for rna extraction . measurement of ethylene production was conducted as previously described . rna analysis was performed as previously described . for generation of a mapping population _PROTEIN_ was crossed to ws wild type and d old etiolated seedlings that displayed the _PROTEIN_ phenotype in the presence of ethylene were isolated and planted in soil for subsequent collection of leaf tissue and isolation of genomic dna . genomic dna was prepared as described and used as a template for pcr based mapping . to narrow the map position of _PROTEIN_ novel caps markers were developed in a previously described manner for the region to which _PROTEIN_ was localized . caps markers generated and used for map based cloning of _PROTEIN_ were as follows . for the marker primers used were cattcagcttttgcttgatgatgtg and _PROTEIN_ . mboi digestion resulted in five dna fragments for col and four for ws . for the marker primers used were _PROTEIN_ and cagaaacacaatatatatgttgctcag . afliii digestion resulted in two dna fragments for col and one for ws . candidate genes within the genetic window were identified and amplified by pcr with pfu turbo and primers designed to the predicted and untranslated regions subcloned into pgemt easy and sequenced by the university of florida dna sequencing core laboratory . sequences were compared with the published arabidopsis genomic sequence to identify the _PROTEIN_ mutation . functional complementation was performed by generation by pcr of a genomic construct representing kb of upstream sequence the complete coding sequence for _GENE_ and its predicted utr . this construct was subcloned into and introduced into the _PROTEIN_ mutant by agrobacterium mediated transformation . primary transformants were selected by screening for those that were glufosinate ammonium resistant with plants subsequently analysed by growth in the dark for d in ethylene after which they were assessed for manifestation of the exaggeration of ethylene response seen for _PROTEIN_ . double mutants were generated by crossing _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . progeny from the crosses with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were grown in the dark for d with ethylene to isolate ethylene insensitive individuals homozygous for _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . isolated individuals were subsequently genotyped by pcr to identify those that were homozygous for the _PROTEIN_ mutation . for pcr analysis cgacttaattctatggattcagatg and _PROTEIN_ were used to amplify a portion of the _PROTEIN_ genomic dna after which the pcr products were cut with rsai and bsli with only wild type dna being cut by bsli at nucleotide of the pcr product . for generation of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant seedlings were screened in the absence of ethylene for those that exhibited a constitutive triple response . identified individuals were subsequently genotyped by pcr to identify those that were homozygous for the _PROTEIN_ mutation . an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ translational fusion was made by combining the _GENE_ genomic construct represented by kb of upstream sequence the utr and the complete coding sequence for _GENE_ with both the intron and exons without the native stop codon with the full coding sequence of _METHOD_ . this construct was cloned into transferred to agrobacterium and infiltrated into nicotiana benthamiana leaves . after d leaves were harvested and treated with or ethylene for h stained with mg diamidino phenylindole for min and visualized using a leica sp confocal microscope . as a control agrobacterium carrying an unfused _METHOD_ construct under the control of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ promoter was infiltrated into tobacco leaves .
