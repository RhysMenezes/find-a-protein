at the core of the eukaryotic circadian network clock genes/proteins form multiple transcriptional/translational negative feedback loops and generate a basic hr oscillation which provides daily regulation for a wide range of processes . this temporal organization enhances the fitness of the organism only if it corresponds to the natural day/night cycles . light is the most effective signal in synchronizing the oscillator to environmental cycles .
_PROTEIN_ was initially isolated as an early phase phase mutant based on the _PROTEIN_ pattern of the morning _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ luc circadian output marker during the first hr in constant dark . however prolonged free running experiments in constant red light demonstrated that the period length of _PROTEIN_ is hr shorter than that of wild type plants . a different molecular marker the evening _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ luc also displayed a similar short period phenotype in ll and dd and leaf movement _METHOD_ were also shortened in _PROTEIN_ . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is not a component of the output pathway because the mutation affects several different overt _METHOD_ . to test the light dependecy of the phenotype the rhythmic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ luc was measured in etiolated wt and _PROTEIN_ plants entrained by hr hr temperature cycles for days and released to constant . both wt and _PROTEIN_ seedlings showed clear oscillations but the period length of _PROTEIN_ luc was significantly shorter in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ than in wt . this result demonstrates that _PROTEIN_ is required for normal clock function in plants grown in the complete absence of light . in plants there is an inverse relationship between the free running period length in ll and the fluence rate of the light the higher the fluence rate the shorter the period . as a result fluence rate curves in plants show a negative slope citation . to construct frcs wt and _PROTEIN_ seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ luc were entrained by _PROTEIN_ cycles for week and transferred to different fluences of constant red or blue light . citation shows that period lengths in the mutant seedlings remain almost constant over the tested range of fluence rates in contrast to wt plants where periods are shortened by increasing light intensity . as a result periods of wt and mutant plants were indistinguishable at medium and high fluences of red light and high fluences of blue light . moreover period lengths in _PROTEIN_ plants in dd fall in the range of period values plotted on frcs further corroborating the _PROTEIN_ that light has very little effect on the pace of the clock in _PROTEIN_ . light input is important not only for tuning the period length but also for daily entrainment . it is a well known phenomenon that the clock restricts its own sensitivity to resetting stimuli to particular times of the day especially around dawn and dusk by rhythmic regulation of the input components . to test whether the mutation affects this function we scanned the entrainability of the clock during a circadian cycle . seedlings free running in dd were irradiated for hr by red light pulses in every hr . the phase of the circadian rhythm shifts upon these resetting light pulses . after correction by the free running period of the untreated plants the phase shifts were plotted as a function of the time of the given resetting stimuli yielding the phase response curves of _PROTEIN_ and wt plants . the most significant difference between _PROTEIN_ and wt plants in sensitivity for resetting stimuli can be observed during the first half of the subjective night . this suggests an important function for _PROTEIN_ at this time of the cycle . to see how period length and mrna level of some of the core oscillator components is affected by _PROTEIN_ we analyzed the temporal _PROTEIN_ of the morning _PROTEIN_ core oscillator genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the evening _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the period length of the _PROTEIN_ luc and _PROTEIN_ luc reporters was tested in wt and _PROTEIN_ seedlings under low fluences of red light . we found that the hr short period phenotype is apparent in all cases in the mutant plants by the fourth day of the free run . the rhythmic accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrna was measured in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under the same conditions by northern blot . this figure shows that although the mutation alters the period length of rhythmic _PROTEIN_ the mean levels of either the morning or the evening _PROTEIN_ core oscillator genes are not affected significantly under free running conditions . we also defined mrna abundance of the same clock genes by quantitative pcr in seedlings grown in _PROTEIN_ cycles . citation d and show that _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively were comparable in _PROTEIN_ and wt seedlings . in contrast citation f illustrates that the abundance of _PROTEIN_ mrna was drastically reduced in _PROTEIN_ as compared to wt . genetic mapping of the _PROTEIN_ mutant identified _GENE_ as _PROTEIN_ and showed that the mutation is caused by a deletion eliminating the first half of the gene successful complementation of _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein under the control of the or the native _PROTEIN_ promoter verified the mapping data . based on the predicted amino acid sequence _PROTEIN_ shows significant similarity to small _PROTEIN_ citation but with some remarkable differences . _PROTEIN_ contains peptide inserts at several positions that are missing from the classical small _PROTEIN_ . the most interesting feature is the replacement of glutamine for histidine . this catalytical glutamine is highly conserved in all of the classical small _PROTEIN_ citation . its mutation results in the loss of _PROTEIN_ activity _PROTEIN_ leading to a constitutively active state of the protein . finally _PROTEIN_ lacks specific motifs at the n or c terminus for lipid modifications . in order to test whether _PROTEIN_ is a functional _PROTEIN_ we purified recombinant maltose binding protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins from escherichia coli and tested for _PROTEIN_ hydrolyzing activity with _PROTEIN_ as substrate . reaction products were analyzed by thin layer chromatography . we were able to detect significant _PROTEIN_ hydrolyzing activity of _PROTEIN_ which clearly showes that despite its atypical nature _PROTEIN_ is a functional _PROTEIN_ . we characterized _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ at multiple levels . first we showed that abundance of _PROTEIN_ mrna in wt seedlings in ll is not significantly affected by the circadian clock and shows only a very weak oscillatory pattern if any . second we determined abundance of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein in _PROTEIN_ seedlings complemented by _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgene under the same conditions . results obtained by western blot analysis do not exclude a possible low amplitude circadian oscillation in the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein level with a peak around the subjective dusk at zt . this _PROTEIN_ pattern conditionally supports the prc data indicating that _PROTEIN_ may function at the first half of the subjective night . finally we characterized the subcellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein in darkness where it most clearly exerts its function . day old etiolated _PROTEIN_ mutant plants _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein were analyzed by confocal microscopy . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ can be observed both in the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ of hypocotyl epidermal cells . the _LOCATION_ was evenly filled with _METHOD_ signal _LOCATION_ speckles were not detected . the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ is not significantly affected by light essentially the same distribution pattern was observed in light grown plants .
