genes and proteins related to patatin the major storage protein of potato tubers have been identified in many plant species and shown to be induced by a variety of environmental stresses . the arabidopsis patatin like gene family _PROTEIN_ comprises nine members two of which _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are strongly induced in leaves _PROTEIN_ with fungal and bacterial pathogens . here we show that accumulation of _PROTEIN_ protein in response to botrytis cinerea or pseudomonas syringae pv . tomato is dependent on jasmonic acid and ethylene signaling but is not dependent on salicylic acid . _PROTEIN_ of a _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion protein and analysis of recombinant _PROTEIN_ indicates that _PROTEIN_ encodes a cytoplasmic lipid acyl hydrolase with wide substrate specificity . transgenic plants with altered levels of _PROTEIN_ protein were generated and assayed for pathogen resistance . plants silenced for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ displayed enhanced resistance to b. cinerea whereas plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ were much more sensitive to this necrotrophic fungus . we also established a positive correlation between the level of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in transgenic plants and cell death or damage in response to paraquat treatment or infection by avirulent p. syringae . interestingly repression of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ increased resistance to avirulent bacteria while _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants multiplied avirulent bacteria close to the titers reached by virulent bacteria . collectively the data indicate that _PROTEIN_ encoded lipolytic activity can be exploited by pathogens with different lifestyles to facilitate host colonization . in particular _PROTEIN_ potentiates plant cell death inflicted by botrytis and reduces the efficiency of the hypersensitive response in restricting the multiplication of avirulent bacteria . both effects are possibly mediated by providing fatty acid precursors of bioactive oxylipins .
a search for patatin homologs in the arabidopsis genome using the potato tuber patatin protein sequence as the query yielded nine genes encoding proteins with sizes ranging from to amino acids . figure presents the _PROTEIN_ code of each gene and the name given by citation based on the phospholipase activity of only one patatin like protein and on gene localization on the chromosomes . for reason of simplicity and convenience we numbered the patatin like proteins _PROTEIN_ according to _PROTEIN_ similarity to potato patatin . sequence comparisons and multiple alignments showed that the proteins fall into two groups with _PROTEIN_ to overall similarity to potato tuber patatin and structure of the catalytic site . group i contains five proteins that are to identical/similar to patatin . the four group ii proteins are only to identical/similar to patatin . pairwise identity/similarity scores can be found in figure . all the patatin sequences identified to date in other plant species belong to group i and share a strictly conserved serine hydrolase/lipase motif gxsxg along with a conserved aspartic acid . these serine and aspartic acid residues constitute a catalytic _PROTEIN_ that is critical for the lah activity of patatin . interestingly these residues are much less conserved in group ii proteins raising the question of whether these _METHOD_ display enzymatic activity . besides arabidopsis a single group ii gene was found in the rice genome but partial group ii cdna sequences can be identified in most plant species with available gene indices . previously an arabidopsis sequence that is similar to animal was found to display a patatin motif and was proposed to define a genuine patatin like subgroup . however we did not include this gene in the _PROTEIN_ as the encoded protein is much larger than _PROTEIN_ contains an n terminal leucine rich repeat and its similarity with the closest patatin homolog is limited to over a region of only amino acids . because of potential cross hybridization between transcripts and to ensure high sensitivity we chose real time reverse transcriptase pcr rather than rna blot hybridization to visualize _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ in leaves _PROTEIN_ with different pathogens . a necrotrophic fungus b. cinerea or an avirulent bacterium p. syringae pv . tomato _PROTEIN_ the avirulence gene were used independently to induce defense responses in leaves . gene specific primer pairs were first checked for robust and specific amplification on genomic dna . however no clear signal was obtained in the rt pcr procedure for genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ before or after infection suggesting that these genes are not _PROTEIN_ to detectable levels in leaves . in healthy leaves a low but unambiguous signal amplification was obtained for four _PROTEIN_ genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was slightly down regulated in response to both pathogens in contrast to _PROTEIN_ which was found slightly induced . levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcript were very low in healthy leaves and clearly increased in response to bc and avirulent pst infections the absolute _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ being about times lower than that of _PROTEIN_ after h . moreover the kinetics of induction upon fungal or bacterial infection were different for both genes . because _PROTEIN_ appeared in these experiments as the only group i gene to be pathogen responsive we decided to focus on its functional characterization . recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein was produced in escherichia coli and a polyclonal antibody was obtained . the serum detected a kda protein only in infected leaves . this signal was lost when serum was pre incubated with recombinant _PROTEIN_ showing that it is specific for _PROTEIN_ . consistent with transcript accumulation data kinetic studies established that _PROTEIN_ protein is induced in leaves infected by b. cinerea or by alternaria brassicicola another necrotrophic fungus whereas no signal was visible in control leaves . the _PROTEIN_ response to pst was examined with the virulent strain and also with two avirulent strains _PROTEIN_ either the or avirulence genes . interestingly the _PROTEIN_ protein was induced to much higher levels in response to the two avirulent strains than to the virulent bacterial strain . this indicates that full induction is associated with the gene for gene dependent hypersensitive response . to investigate the distribution of gene _PROTEIN_ in leaves _PROTEIN_ promoter gus reporter lines were generated . a kb genomic fragment of the _PROTEIN_ gene was cloned upstream of the gus coding sequence and the construct was transformed into col plants . single insertion plants were inoculated with bc or pst strains and infected leaves were stained for gus activity h _PROTEIN_ . figure shows strong gus staining in living tissue immediately surrounding bc lesions whereas central dead tissue was devoid of staining . after infiltration of avirulent pst staining was also restricted to a _PROTEIN_ of cells at the edge of the infiltrated area in which no signal was visible . with both pathogens the strongest _PROTEIN_ promoter activity was observed at the infection front in cells that will undergo subsequent cell death . on the contrary diffuse gus staining was visible in tissue areas infiltrated with virulent pst bacteria . in immunoblotting experiments the induction by bc was found to be restricted to infected leaves as no _PROTEIN_ protein could be detected in systemic leaves . to unravel the signaling pathway involved in this induction _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was examined after bc inoculation in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant lines that are insensitive to jasmonic acid ethylene and salicylic acid defense signals respectively . figure shows that _PROTEIN_ accumulation is abolished in _PROTEIN_ and nearly absent in _PROTEIN_ genotypes but similar to wild type in _PROTEIN_ . a similar regulation was observed after infiltration of pst . this result indicates that induction of _PROTEIN_ by pathogens is dependent on ja and et signaling but not on sa signaling . consistently abundant _PROTEIN_ accumulation could be induced by a combined treatment with amino cyclopropane _PROTEIN_ acid the precursor of et and methyl jasmonate . in contrast severe wounding of leaves did not result in the induction of _PROTEIN_ protein to detectable levels . this was confirmed with _PROTEIN_ gus reporter lines which did not show any gus staining after mechanical wounding . _PROTEIN_ cdna was amplified from rna extracted from infected leaves and cloned in the e. coli pgex kg _PROTEIN_ vector in c terminal fusion with glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ . a protein of kda corresponding to the predicted size of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion was visible in the lysate of induced bacteria . the fusion protein was captured on glutathione agarose beads and cleaved with thrombin to release the kda _PROTEIN_ protein . the analysis of the successive purification steps by _PROTEIN_ is shown in figure . the purified _PROTEIN_ protein was first assayed for fatty acid release from oleic acid labeled e. coli _LOCATION_ as substrate . oleic acid incorporates _PROTEIN_ into the sn position of phospholipids _LOCATION_ providing a specific assay with the lipid substrate being presented in a biological _LOCATION_ environment . the _PROTEIN_ protein displayed a dose dependent activity in this assay . to determine substrate preference on isolated lipids _PROTEIN_ activity was monitored in a mixed micelle assay with phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylethanolamine and on the galactolipids monogalactosyldiacylglycerol or digalactosyldiacylglycerol as substrates . in plant leaves pc and pe are the most abundant lipids of extrachloroplastic _LOCATION_ whereas galactolipids are predominant in chloroplastic _LOCATION_ . the nature and quantity of free fas released were determined by gas chromatography . although all four lipids were substrates the highest activity was found with mgdg followed by dgdg pe and pc . in all cases the ratio of fas released from a given substrate was similar to that obtained by chemical hydrolysis indicating that _PROTEIN_ has no sn position specificity . thus _PROTEIN_ displays preferential galactolipase activity in vitro exceeding pla activity . no particular targeting sequence could be identified in the predicted _PROTEIN_ protein sequence . to get insight into the subcellular localization of the protein the _PROTEIN_ cdna was cloned upstream of the enhanced green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ sequence under the control of the promoter . the construct was then transformed stably into col plants . transformants were indistinguishable from control plants and leaf sectors from plants were observed for _METHOD_ _METHOD_ by confocal microscopy . consistent with the absence of a cleavable n terminal signal sequence _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was visible in the cytoplasm both in uninfected mesophyll and in epidermal cells . in mesophyll the _METHOD_ signal was restricted to the narrow zone of cytoplasm at the periphery of the cell with clear exclusion from chloroplasts as seen by chlorophyll red _METHOD_ . in epidermal cells that are poor in chloroplasts green _METHOD_ was apparent in cortical cytoplasm . in pst infected leaves labeling was more heterogeneous and reticulated suggesting that under pathogen attack part of _PROTEIN_ is redistributed to _LOCATION_ structures . taken together the results show that _PROTEIN_ is a lah with wide substrate specificity that is predominantly located in the cytoplasm of healthy leaves but _METHOD_ to associate with cellular _LOCATION_ in infected cells . in order to study the in planta function of _PROTEIN_ we searched for insertion mutant lines in available t dna collections . a line from the gabi kat collection was identified with an insertion in the second exon of the _PROTEIN_ gene . the progeny after selfing of this line segregated sulfadiazine resistant plantlets . genotyping of resistant plants identified no homozygous plant for the insertion . accordingly when immature siliques of heterozygote plants were examined of embryos were found blocked at the globular to heart stage . these observations suggest that this mutant line has a defect that results in embryo lethality in the homozygous state . we transformed the heterozygous mutant with either a construct containing a genomic fragment encompassing the complete _PROTEIN_ gene or with a _PROTEIN_ cdna construct but were unable to unambigously restore a normal segregation in the progeny of the transformants . as no other t dna line was available we decided to silence the _PROTEIN_ gene by an rna interference approach . we generated plants transformed with a construct containing a hairpin repeat of a fragment of the _PROTEIN_ cdna under the control of the promoter . in parallel _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants _PROTEIN_ containing the entire _PROTEIN_ cdna behind the same promoter were obtained . none of these plant lines exhibited any visible developmental phenotype . fifteen independent transgenic lines were selected by immunodetection of the _PROTEIN_ protein before and after infection by bc and two single insertion lines for each construct were further analyzed . figure shows a representative example for each construct . in contrast to control lines lines did not accumulate detectable levels of _PROTEIN_ protein h after bc inoculation . conversely uninfected _PROTEIN_ lines displayed constitutive _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ protein to a level comparable to infected wild type plants . as mgdg proved to be the best substrate of recombinant _PROTEIN_ enzyme we used it as a substrate to measure lah activity levels in the same plant extracts . in all cases enzyme activity was strictly correlated with the intensity of the _PROTEIN_ signal . the activity was undetectable in untreated wild type plants but was clearly induced after bc infection . like the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ protein the induction of lah activity was abolished in infected plants . silencing was also observed in response to pst infection or acc/mj treatment . conversely the constitutive _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in uninfected _PROTEIN_ lines was accompanied by a constitutive lah activity . these data demonstrate that in arabidopsis soluble lah activity is induced upon pathogen infection and that this activity is due to the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene . to gain insight into the role of _PROTEIN_ in the outcome of microbial attack transgenic plants with altered _PROTEIN_ levels were _PROTEIN_ with bc and pst and the lesion growth/multiplication of the pathogen was measured . bc spores were inoculated on half leaves across the midvein and _METHOD_ were observed days _PROTEIN_ . as shown in figure _METHOD_ observed days after inoculation of bc spores differed between the three plant genotypes . strikingly plants showed lesions with reduced sizes compared with controls whereas _PROTEIN_ plants exhibited enhanced disease _METHOD_ . disease was scored by counting the distribution of the lesions in three size classes small diameter mm medium mm < diameter mm large diameter > mm . this scoring also reflected the visual severity of _METHOD_ . figure shows that plants exhibit a reduction in the percentage of large lesions and a corresponding increase in the proportion of small lesions number . conversely _PROTEIN_ plants showed a marked reduction in small and medium sized lesions and an increase close to in the proportion of large lesions . to determine if changes in lesion sizes were due to altered fungal growth we monitored fungal dna content in leaves by real time pcr with tubulin specific primers . as seen in figure at and days post inoculation differential fungal growth in _PROTEIN_ modified plants confirmed altered resistance revealed by measurements of lesion size . these results clearly indicate that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ favors the progression of b. cinerea in leaf tissue . we then examined the behavior of _PROTEIN_ modified plants in response to pst infection . inoculation of colony forming units resulted in the appearance of differential _METHOD_ with pst as shown in figure while _METHOD_ were similar with virulent pst . at h after infiltration with pst control plants showed _METHOD_ of drying typical of hr . curling of the tip of the leaves due to water loss was reduced in plants while _METHOD_ were more severe in _PROTEIN_ plants that exhibited exaggerated cell damage . to monitor the evolution of cell death ion leakage was measured in the three genotypes upon pst infection . ion leakage reflecting damage to _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was correlated with symptom severity with a weaker response in plants and an enhancement in _PROTEIN_ plants compared with control plants . to evaluate the levels of pst resistance in the transgenic lines plants were infiltrated with cfu of bacteria and the leaf bacterial titer was determined over days after inoculation . growth of virulent pst bacteria was identical in control and in plants . as expected the multiplication of avirulent pst bacteria was restricted in control plants due to the hr triggered by gene for gene recognition . in _PROTEIN_ deficient plants the _PROTEIN_ in bacterial multiplication was even more pronounced at days . thus _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in control plants allows more consistent multiplication of avirulent pseudomonas bacteria compared with silenced plants at the _PROTEIN_ stages of infection . in a second series of experiments we monitored the growth of both bacterial strains in _PROTEIN_ plants . growth of virulent pst was only slightly enhanced in _PROTEIN_ plants compared with controls . strikingly multiplication of avirulent pst bacteria was strongly increased in _PROTEIN_ plants with titers close to those reached by virulent bacteria . collectively our results show that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ provides a more favorable environment for the multiplication of a necrotrophic fungus and an avirulent bacterium . because transgenic plants with altered levels of _PROTEIN_ exhibited modified levels of resistance to two pathogens that trigger different _METHOD_ of host cell death we examined their sensitivity to paraquat a chemical that induces necrosis by generating toxic reactive oxygen intermediates . as shown in figure control plants exhibited no _METHOD_ h after paraquat treatment whereas at h small necrotic areas developed within the infiltrated zone . plants showed a reduction in the extent of necrosis at h the necrotic spots always being clearly smaller than the treated zone . in _PROTEIN_ plants cell death appeared by h post treatment and at h damage was much more severe than in the controls reaching the edges or tips of the leaves . protein extracts of plants infiltrated with paraquat were analyzed for the presence of _PROTEIN_ . figure shows that _PROTEIN_ is induced concomitantly with the appearance of tissue damage at h in control plants confirming at the protein level the upregulation of the _PROTEIN_ gene by paraquat that was reported earlier by transcriptome analysis . _PROTEIN_ protein was undetectable in silenced plants and its level slightly increased after paraquat treatment in sense plants . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ potentiates the appearance of _METHOD_ of cell death induced by paraquat .
