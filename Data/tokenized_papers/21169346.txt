the photoreceptor phytochrome a _PROTEIN_ regulates germination and seedling establishment by mediating very low fluence and far red high irradiance responses in arabidopsis thaliana . in darkness _PROTEIN_ homodimers exist in the biologically inactive pr form and are localized in the cytoplasm . light induces formation of the biologically active pfr form and subsequent rapid _LOCATION_ import . _PROTEIN_ pfr in contrast to the pr form is labile and has a half life of min . we produced transgenic plants in a _PROTEIN_ null background that _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ or the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dimerization domain and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dd _LOCATION_ localization signal or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dd _LOCATION_ exclusion signal fusion proteins . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins contained the n terminal domain of _PROTEIN_ a short dd and the _METHOD_ . here we report that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dd fusion protein is imported into the _LOCATION_ in a light dependent fashion neither of the _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins is functional in fr hir and _LOCATION_ vlfr and the _PROTEIN_ dependent blue light induced inhibition of hypocotyl growth is mediated by the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dd nes but not by the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dd nls and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dd fusion proteins . we demonstrate that light induces degradation of all _PROTEIN_ n terminal containing fusion proteins and these n terminal domain containing fusion proteins including the constitutively _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dd nls and predominantly cytoplasmic _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dd nes degrade at comparable rates but markedly more slowly than _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ whereas light induced degradation of the native _PROTEIN_ is faster compared with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ .
to assess the regulatory role of the _PROTEIN_ n terminal region in the vlfr and hir type of signaling we constructed two sets of chimeric gene constructs . first we amplified a amino acid fragment containing the _PROTEIN_ n terminal fragment that does not contain the quail box shown to be involved in mediating _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ signaling but carries all the domains which are necessary for the function of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ . next we constructed a chimeric gene encoding a fusion protein consisting of the _PROTEIN_ n terminal fragment followed by the _METHOD_ and a short dd of the transcription _PROTEIN_ cprf as described in pfeiffer et al . . to ensure targeted subcellular localization we produced additional chimeric genes encoding the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dd nls and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dd nes fusion proteins . next we produced transgenic plants in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background _PROTEIN_ these fusion proteins and the full length _PROTEIN_ protein fused to _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ of the transgenes was under the control of the native _PROTEIN_ promoter localized on a kb fragment . schematic illustration of the domain structure of _PROTEIN_ and the fusion proteins used in this study is shown in . we regenerated about independent transgenic lines for each construct . the selected lines were bred to homozygocity and multiplied to facilitate functional characterization of the various fusion proteins for vlfr and fr hir signaling . before starting functional characterization we determined the _PROTEIN_ levels of the various fusion proteins in each of the homozygous transgenic lines by western blot hybridization . after analyzing total protein extracts prepared from etiolated seedlings we chose lines that _PROTEIN_ these various fusion proteins _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at the most comparable levels . we note that the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dd and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dd nls fusion proteins was constantly lower in all tested lines when compared with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dd nes and that the _PROTEIN_ level of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was sufficiently high to fully complement the _PROTEIN_ mutant in all aspects tested . these selected lines were then subjected to detailed physiological microscopic and molecular analysis . first we measured inhibition of hypocotyl elongation and cotyledon size and unfolding in transgenic seedlings grown in darkness or under different intensities of cfr and r light . fig . and d demonstrate that etiolated seedlings _PROTEIN_ the various fusion proteins exhibited normal skotomorphogenesis . we found that the hypocotyl elongation and cotyledon size of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dd _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dd nls or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dd nes _PROTEIN_ seedlings were not affected by cfr light but showed normal hypocotyl growth inhibition in continuous r light . the phenotype of these transgenic seedlings was identical to that of the _PROTEIN_ mutant whereas the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ resulted in a complete complementation of the _PROTEIN_ deficient mutant in cfr light . we used the same transgenic seedlings to measure the inducibility of a selected group of genes that had been shown to respond to cfr light treatment by teppermann et al . . supplementary fig . shows that treatment of the seedlings _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ n terminal domain with h cfr light did not increase the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes above threshold levels . taken together these data suggest that neither of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dd containing fusion proteins is functional in fr hir . the _PROTEIN_ vlfr mode of signaling has been implicated in regulating several aspects of seedling development including abrogation of gravitropism and inhibition of hypocotyl elongation by repeated r and/or fr pulses . first we characterized a frequently used _LOCATION_ vlfr namely the _PROTEIN_ mediated inhibition of hypocotyl elongation in response to repeated pulses of fr light . we found that none of the transgenic seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dd responded to cyclic fr pulses given after various time intervals of darkness whereas the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ resulted in full complementation of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . next we measured _PROTEIN_ suppressed gravitropism of transgenic seedlings in cfr light . supplementary fig . illustrates randomization of hypocotyl growth orientation by fr light in the wild type _PROTEIN_ and various transgenic lines . this figure shows that _PROTEIN_ exhibited complete insensitivity toward fr light abrogation of gravitropism whereas transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ the full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein displayed sensitivity similar to that of the wild type . all other transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dd _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dd nls and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dd nes fusion proteins showed a phenotype similar to that of the _PROTEIN_ mutant suggesting that these _PROTEIN_ n terminal fragments are also insufficient to mediate cfr light induced gravitropism . in addition to these physiological responses the ability of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins to induce vlfr at the level of gene _PROTEIN_ was also determined . it was found that irradiation of the various _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dd _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dd nls and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dd nes _PROTEIN_ lines with pulses of r light that yield and _PROTEIN_ pfr are not sufficient to bring about detectable increases in the abundance of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrna . in contrast the same treatment was clearly efficient in elevating the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ above threshold levels in the wild type or _PROTEIN_ lines _PROTEIN_ the full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins . beside the above described vlfrs that are thought to be mediated by _PROTEIN_ localized in the _LOCATION_ we also characterized these transgenic lines for hypocotyl growth inhibition in continuous blue light . according to rosler et al . this response is independent of _PROTEIN_ thus it is likely to be regulated by cytoplasmic _PROTEIN_ . fig . shows that the phenotype of wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings is indeed different in cb light and that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dd nes transgenic seedlings exhibited a phenotype similar to the wild type . in contrast the same figure shows that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dd and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dd nls seedlings did not respond to cb light . these data suggest that the _PROTEIN_ n terminal fragment constitutively localized in the cytoplasm is capable at least partially of mediating b light induced _PROTEIN_ regulated signaling . the majority of _PROTEIN_ controlled physiological responses with a few exceptions described by rosler et al . are mediated by _PROTEIN_ localized in the _LOCATION_ . the _LOCATION_ import of _PROTEIN_ requires _PROTEIN_ and shows a characteristic dependence on the light quality and quantity indicating that _LOCATION_ import of _PROTEIN_ itself can be classified as vlfr and/or fr hir . to test whether nucleo/cytoplasmic partitioning of the _PROTEIN_ n terminal fragments is still subject to light regulation we monitored the cellular distribution of these fusion proteins in seedlings exposed to various light treatments . we found as expected that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dd nls and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dd nes fusion proteins were constitutively localized in the _LOCATION_ and in the cytoplasm respectively in both etiolated and light grown/treated cells . this figure however also illustrates that the cellular distribution of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dd fusion proteins similarly to that of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is controlled by light . in etiolated seedlings the abundance of these fusion proteins in the _LOCATION_ is below the level of detection whereas short r light pulses and/or cfr light induce rapid _LOCATION_ translocation of these chimeric photoreceptors . in addition we found that in contrast to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ seedlings irradiation of cfr light pre treated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dd _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dd nls and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dd nes seedlings with r light pulses failed to induce the formation of _PROTEIN_ containing _LOCATION_ bodies in the _LOCATION_ and/or _PROTEIN_ in the cytoplasm . on the other hand fig . and b also shows that irradiation of seedlings with h r light lowered the _METHOD_ of all types of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins below the level of detection thereby indicating that the stability/degradation of the pfr conformers of these chimeric _PROTEIN_ photoreceptors is regulated by light . to assess degradation of these _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins in more detail we performed a series of western blot hybridization experiments . first we compared the kinetics of r light induced degradation of native _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein . our results demonstrate that irradiation with h of r light lowered the level of the native _PROTEIN_ below the level of detection whereas the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was still clearly visible . accordingly quantification of the western blot experiments showed that residual levels of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein were about twice as high as that of the native _PROTEIN_ after and h irradiation with r light . next we determined whether removal of the c terminal domain and compartmentalization has any effect on r light induced degradation of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dd _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dd nls and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dd nes fusion proteins . fig . illustrates that r light induced degradation of these truncated fusion proteins did not differ significantly but was slower compared with that of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . taken together these data indicate that degradation of the _PROTEIN_ pfr conformer is largely but not exclusively mediated by the n terminal domain of _PROTEIN_ and that degradation of the _PROTEIN_ n terminal domain containing fusion proteins in the _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm follows a nearly identical pattern .
the native _PROTEIN_ promoter and the full length _PROTEIN_ cdna fragment were cut out from the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ppcv plasmid and inserted into the _METHOD_ nos terminator carrying ppcv . to create the n terminal _PROTEIN_ cdna fusions first we generated modified versions of the binary vector that contained either nls or nes sequences . the dna fragment containing the nls was obtained by annealing two oligonucleotides _PROTEIN_ encoding the amino acid residues lpkkkrkvgg . nes from pki was generated by annealing the oligonucleotides
