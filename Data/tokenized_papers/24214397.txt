_PROTEIN_ of sphingolipid homeostasis is critical for cell growth and programmed cell death . serine palmitoyltransferase _PROTEIN_ composed of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ subunits catalyzes the primary regulatory point for sphingolipid synthesis . small subunits of _PROTEIN_ that strongly stimulate _PROTEIN_ activity have been identified in mammals but the role of ssspt in eukaryotic cells is unclear . candidate arabidopsis thaliana ssspts ssspta and sssptb were identified and characterized . _PROTEIN_ of these amino acid polypeptides in a saccharomyces cerevisiae _PROTEIN_ null mutant stimulated _PROTEIN_ activity from the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ heterodimer by > fold through physical interaction with _PROTEIN_ . ssspta transcripts were more enriched in all organs and > fold more abundant in pollen than sssptb transcripts . accordingly homozygous ssspta t dna mutants were not recoverable and nonviable pollen was detected in heterozygous ssspta mutants . pollen viability was recovered by _PROTEIN_ of wild type ssspta or sssptb under control of the ssspta promoter indicating ssspta and sssptb functional redundancy . _PROTEIN_ activity and sensitivity to the pcd inducing mycotoxin fumonisin _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were increased by ssspta overexpression . conversely _PROTEIN_ activity and _PROTEIN_ sensitivity were reduced in ssspta rna interference lines . these results demonstrate that ssspts are essential for male gametophytes are important for _PROTEIN_ sensitivity and limit sphingolipid synthesis in planta .
two genes designated ssspta and sssptb encoding amino acid polypeptides were identified in homology searches using the human ssspts as query . the amino acid sequences of the arabidopsis polypeptides share identity and have predicted homologs throughout the plant kingdom . arabidopsis ssspta and sssptb also share to amino acid sequence identity with human ssspta and to identity with human sssptb but < identity with the s. cerevisiae . arabidopsis ssspta and sssptb have one likely transmembrane domain encompassing to amino acids in the central portion of the polypeptides based on predictions from the sosui toppred and tmpred _METHOD_ . this is also consistent with mammalian ssspts which have been shown to contain a single transmembrane domain . to establish their functions arabidopsis human influenza hemagglutinin tagged ssspta and sssptb were _PROTEIN_ along with the arabidopsis core _PROTEIN_ subunits _PROTEIN_ with a _PROTEIN_ tag and _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ with myc tags in a yeast mutant lacking endogenous _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with the myc _PROTEIN_ subunits failed to complement the long chain base auxotrophy of the yeast mutant but coexpression of either ha ssspta or ha sssptb resulted in robust growth even at where the requirement for _PROTEIN_ activity is relatively high . immunoprecipitation of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ subunit resulted in copurification of the ha ssspts as well as the myc _PROTEIN_ subunits . this reflects specific binding of ha ssspta with the _PROTEIN_ heterodimer because no ha ssspta bound to the beads when solubilized microsomes prepared from cells _PROTEIN_ untagged _PROTEIN_ myc _PROTEIN_ and ha ssspta were used for the immunoprecipitation . the ssspts behave like integral _LOCATION_ proteins when coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as the proteins are solubilized with detergents and urea but not by salt or bicarbonate . by analogy to the human ssspts we predicted that the arabidopsis ssspts would have a single transmembrane domain and that their c termini would reside in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ lumen . to directly address the location of the c terminus of sssptb a glycosylation cassette containing three consensus asnx glycosylation sites was appended to the c terminus of ha sssptb and tagged protein was assessed for glycosylation based on sensitivity to endoglycosidase h treatment . the increased electrophoretic mobility of ha sssptb following endo h treatment provides strong evidence that the c terminus is in the _LOCATION_ lumen . consistent with the complementation data microsomes prepared from yeast _PROTEIN_ the at _PROTEIN_ heterodimers had very low _PROTEIN_ activity whereas coexpression of either at ssspta or at sssptb increased the microsomal _PROTEIN_ activities > fold . with all four combinations of _PROTEIN_ ssspt and _PROTEIN_ subunits a high preference for palmitoyl coa was observed . activities measured with myristoyl or stearoyl coa were < of the activity with palmitoyl coa . the higher _PROTEIN_ activities measured with ssspta are likely due to higher _PROTEIN_ levels achieved with ssspta versus sssptb as indicated by protein gel blot analysis of microsomes from the recombinant yeast rather than to an intrinsic functional difference between these polypeptides . confocal microscopy studies were conducted on transiently _PROTEIN_ ssspta and sssptb with n terminal yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tags in nicotiana benthamiana to establish the intracellular localization of these polypeptides . both polypeptides were found to colocalize with the _LOCATION_ marker mcherry hdel . this is consistent with _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as previously reported . to assess the in planta contributions of each gene to _PROTEIN_ activation transcript levels of ssspta and sssptb were measured in different organs of arabidopsis . it is notable that neither gene is represented in any of the public microarray databases . our analyses revealed that ssspta is more highly _PROTEIN_ than sssptb in all organs examined . of most significance ssspta transcript levels were nearly fold more abundant in pollen than those for sssptb . ssspta transcripts were also and fold more abundant in flowers and leaves respectively than sssptb transcripts . to further examine the relative in planta contributions of ssspta and sssptb t dna insertion mutants for each gene were characterized . ssspta is on chromosome and has two introns within the coding sequence whereas sssptb is on chromosome and has two introns within the coding sequence . t dna insertion mutants were identified for each gene for ssspta and and for sssptb . in the case of sssptb and sssptb lines homozygous for the t dna insertion and lacking detectable sssptb transcript were identified . homozygous sssptb and sssptb plants were indistinguishable in their growth and pollen viability from wild type plants . by contrast no homozygous ssspta mutants were identified by genotyping plants over three generations suggesting that ssspta is an essential gene . examination of pollen with viability stain revealed nonviable pollen in ssspta plants genotyped as heterozygous for the t dna insertion . goodness of fit tests confirmed that the defect observed in pollen collected from ssspta heterozygous plants segregated at the expected ratio for a male gametophytic lethal mutation within a to confidence interval . however the relative numbers of aborted ovules in these plants were low and not significantly different from those in wild type plants . levels of pollen viability were restored to wild type levels by introduction of a wild type copy of ssspta into ssspta plants genotyped as homozygous for the ssspta allele . overall these results demonstrate that ssspta but not sssptb is essential for pollen viability . the much higher _PROTEIN_ of ssspta relative to sssptb in pollen likely accounts for the inability of sssptb to compensate for loss of ssspta to _PROTEIN_ normal male gametophytic development . to test this hypothesis the sssptb cdna was placed under control of the ssspta promoter and introduced into the heterozygous ssspta mutant . based on genotyping data plants were recovered that _PROTEIN_ this transgene and contained the homozygous ssspta allele and lacked defective pollen . these findings indicate that the ssspta and sssptb polypeptides are functionally redundant . we also tested whether ssspta is essential for sporophytic growth by _PROTEIN_ of an ssspta cdna under control of the pollen and ovule specific _PROTEIN_ promoter in the ssspta mutant to advance the ssspta allele beyond pollen development . no transgenic plants genotyped as ssspta and lacking the ssspta transcript in leaves were recovered . instead four independent ssspta lines were obtained that were severely dwarfed and had low levels of ssspta _PROTEIN_ in leaves presumably due to leaky _PROTEIN_ from the _PROTEIN_ promoter . these plants had pollen with high levels of viability and the dwarf phenotype persisted into the subsequent generation . this result suggests that ssspta is also essential for sporophytic growth . ssspta overexpression and suppression lines were generated in wild type arabidopsis to determine the impact on _PROTEIN_ activity in planta . overexpression lines were prepared by placing the ssspta cdna under control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter and rna interference lines were generated using hairpin generating constructs that targeted the ssspta gene under control of the promoter . homozygous lines from the introduction of these transgenes in wild type arabidopsis were screened by quantitative pcr to identify those with strongly enhanced or suppressed _PROTEIN_ of ssspta . enzyme assays conducted with microsomes prepared from rosettes revealed an approximately twofold increase in _PROTEIN_ activity in a selected overexpression line and up to a twofold _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ activity in two independent suppression lines . these results indicated that _PROTEIN_ activity in planta can be modulated by altered _PROTEIN_ of ssspta and based on the findings from the overexpression line levels of ssspta _PROTEIN_ are limiting for maximal _PROTEIN_ activity in planta . based on results from _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis mutants altered _PROTEIN_ activity should affect resistance to the ceramide synthase mycotoxin inhibitor _PROTEIN_ . enhanced _PROTEIN_ activity is hypothesized to increase _PROTEIN_ sensitivity by heightened production of cytotoxic lcbs whereas reduced _PROTEIN_ activity is hypothesized to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ sensitivity by lessened production of lcbs . consistent with these hypotheses ssspta suppression lines were observed to have increased resistance to _PROTEIN_ suppression lines _PROTEIN_ viability at _PROTEIN_ which was toxic to wild type plants . conversely ssspta overexpression lines displayed strong sensitivity to _PROTEIN_ but wild type plants retained viability at this _PROTEIN_ concentration . consistent with this free lcb and lcb phosphate accumulation in the ssspta rnai line was strongly reduced relative to that in wild type plants in response to _PROTEIN_ whereas free lcb and lcb phosphate accumulation was approximately threefold higher in the ssspta overexpression line relative to that in wild type plants in response to _PROTEIN_ . these results indicate that altered ssspta _PROTEIN_ is an effective means of modulating sensitivity of plants to _PROTEIN_ and likely other sphinganine analog mycotoxins by increasing or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ activity . human ssspta and sssptb confer distinct substrate specificities to human _PROTEIN_ ssspta _PROTEIN_ with human _PROTEIN_ results in substrate preference for palmitoyl coa to generate lcbs whereas sssptb _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ results in preference for stearoyl coa to generate _PROTEIN_ lcbs . the basis for this is due to a single amino acid difference in human ssspta and sssptb . like human ssspta at ssspta and at sssptb have met at the equivalent position and _PROTEIN_ of either at ssspta or at sssptb with at _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or at _PROTEIN_ yields activity primarily with palmitoyl coa . to test the importance of amino acid of at ssspts for _PROTEIN_ substrate specificity met in at sssptb was mutated to val and _PROTEIN_ in a yeast _PROTEIN_ null mutant along with at _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and in wild type arabidopsis . consistent with findings with human _PROTEIN_ yeast coexpressing wild type arabidopsis sssptb and at lcb/at _PROTEIN_ accumulated exclusively lcbs while those _PROTEIN_ the arabidopsis sssptb mutant accumulated high levels of _PROTEIN_ lcbs reflecting condensation of ser with stearoyl coa . similarly _PROTEIN_ of at sssptb in arabidopsis resulted in the aberrant production of _PROTEIN_ lcbs that accumulated in all sphingolipid classes . these findings indicate that a single conserved amino acid in human and arabidopsis ssspts is critical for _PROTEIN_ substrate specificity even though these polypeptides share amino acid sequence identity . in addition arabidopsis lines _PROTEIN_ the sssptb mutant displayed enhanced sensitivity to _PROTEIN_ and enhanced overall accumulation of free and phosphorylated lcbs in response to _PROTEIN_ relative to wild type plants . this effect is similar to that described above for ssspta overexpression .
