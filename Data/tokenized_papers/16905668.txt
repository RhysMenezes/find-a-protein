an arabidopsis multigene family encodes plant c terminal domain phosphatases that dephosphorylate ser residues in tandem heptad repeat sequences of the rna polymerase ii c terminus . ctd phosphatase like _METHOD_ and are regulators of osmotic stress and abscisic acid signaling . evidence presented herein indicates that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are homologs of a prototype ctd phosphatase . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ contain catalytic homology and breast cancer c terminus domains . recombinant _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interact with _PROTEIN_ an arabidopsis ortholog of a interacting tfiif subunit . a _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ c terminal fragment that contains the brct domain mediates molecular interaction with _PROTEIN_ . consistent with their predicted roles in transcriptional regulation green _METHOD_ protein fusion proteins of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ all localize to the _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ mutations that eliminate the brct or homology domain cause aba hyperactivation of the stress inducible _PROTEIN_ promoter whereas rnai suppression of _PROTEIN_ results in dwarfism and reduced seedling growth . these results indicate _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are a paralogous pair of general transcription regulators with similar biochemical properties but are required for the distinct developmental and environmental responses . _PROTEIN_ is necessary for normal plant growth and thus most orthologous to fungal and metazoan whereas _PROTEIN_ is an isoform that specifically facilitates aba signaling .
the arabidopsis genome contains two predicted open reading frames _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ and _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ which encode proteins with domains . we determined previously that _PROTEIN_ encodes a functional phosphatase that regulates stress responsive transcription and to a lesser extent plant growth and development . genome annotation indicates that _GENE_ encodes _PROTEIN_ however sequence analysis of _PROTEIN_ sequence tag clone established that polyadenylation occurs at position of _GENE_ upstream of the predicted phosphatase coding sequence . the presence of several est sequences corresponding to the phosphatase region indicates that _PROTEIN_ is transcribed from the second orf separated from the upstream orf encoding . analysis of _PROTEIN_ products identified the _PROTEIN_ transcription start site at base of chromosome v. the _PROTEIN_ orf encodes a amino acid polypeptide that contains a catalytic fcph domain and a brct domain . sequence identities between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are and in the fcph and brct domains respectively . rice genes that encode homologs of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were identified also . is amino acids in length and lacks the long n terminus of _PROTEIN_ . however the overlapping sequences are identical . two rice genes encode _PROTEIN_ . and are and amino acid residues respectively and have and amino acid identity to polypeptide respectively . the _PROTEIN_ subunit of the general transcription _PROTEIN_ tfiif interacts and activates family phosphatases . a single arabidopsis gene encodes a human _PROTEIN_ homolog based on blast analysis . a cdna clone encoding _PROTEIN_ was obtained by reverse transcription pcr and the nucleotide sequence was identical to the sequence annotation in genbank . the orf of _PROTEIN_ encodes a amino acid peptide . two rice homologs and were identified . the _PROTEIN_ n terminus is not highly homologous to the corresponding regions in metazoan and fungal _PROTEIN_ orthologs . however the central region of _PROTEIN_ is rich in acidic residues which is a common feature in other _PROTEIN_ proteins . the c terminal amino acids of _PROTEIN_ has sequence identity to human and drosophila _PROTEIN_ c terminal regions that interact with cognate homologs . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were constitutively _PROTEIN_ in both shoots and roots . _PROTEIN_ only was induced moderately by nacl treatment which may be linked to its role in stress responsive signaling . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion proteins were localized exclusively to the _LOCATION_ . the _METHOD_ signal was detected within h and _LOCATION_ localization did not change throughout the duration of the experiment . only a t dna insertion in the _PROTEIN_ untranslated region _PROTEIN_ could be identified and plants lacked any visible phenotypic abnormalities . therefore rnai suppression was used to generate _PROTEIN_ reduced _PROTEIN_ lines . fifty five hygromycin resistant plants were recovered from two independent transformation experiments and these exhibited a range of phenotypic abnormalities . germination and seedling establishment comparisons were used to categorize the lines into two classes . eight independent lines were normal whereas the rest exhibited incomplete to no cotyledon expansion . class ii plants grew very slowly and the initial true leaves remained small had short petioles and curled downward after the subsequent growth . a group of class ii plants subsequently produced leaves that had longer petioles and developed similarly to wild type . twenty lines from class ii plants matured without recovery from the growth defects and produced small inflorescences . ten class ii lines produced only three to four true leaves in d and did not reach maturity . hygromycin resistant vector control lines did not exhibit any of these anomalies . cosegregation of the growth phenotype and hygromycin resistance in viable class ii rnai _PROTEIN_ lines was confirmed at the generation . all plants with class ii phenotype exhibited hygromycin resistance whereas all plants with wild type phenotypes were hygromycin sensitive . these results established that class ii growth and developmental phenotypes are linked to the rnai _PROTEIN_ transgene and make it likely that severe growth defects of some class ii plants are due to greater suppression of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in these lines . segregation analysis of rnai _PROTEIN_ plants in generation approximately seeds/line were germinated on murashige and skoog medium and scored for wild type/class ii phenotype . the seedlings were then transferred to murashige and skoog medium containing hygromycin and scored for the hygromycin resistant /sensitive phenotype . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are distinct cpl _METHOD_ by the presence of the brct domain in the c terminus which is an essential module of metazoan and fungal orthologs and is required for catalytic activity of schizosaccharomyces pombe . this contrasts with the human small ctd phosphatase _PROTEIN_ family and arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ that require only the fcph domain for ctd phosphatase activity . to assess the in planta function of the brct domain in _PROTEIN_ the capacity of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ to suppress the aba hyperinduction of _PROTEIN_ luciferase _PROTEIN_ caused by _PROTEIN_ was assessed . the _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion disrupts the _PROTEIN_ catalytic domain . the t dna insertion in _PROTEIN_ is at position from the _PROTEIN_ initiation codon of genomic sequence _GENE_ and the insertion in _PROTEIN_ is at position _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ alleles resulted in the production of chimeric transcripts that could produce proteins that are truncated in the fcph and brct domains respectively . aba inducible _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ luc in plants was determined by ccd image analysis . as shown in figure both alleles failed to complement the aba hyperresponsiveness caused by _PROTEIN_ . apparently the amino acid distal region of the brct domain is essential for full biological functionality of _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ brct domain does not include an evident _LOCATION_ localization sequence as in the yeast consequently this domain in the plant protein apparently does not function to facilitate _LOCATION_ localization . yeast and human contain a central acidic hydrophobic region and the brct domain distal to the fcph domain and this peptide region overlaps with the _PROTEIN_ binding region . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ catalytic fcph domains are located in close proximity to the c terminus and the brct domain in each protein can be identified on the distal side . to determine whether the brct containing c terminal region of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mediates interaction between cpl and _PROTEIN_ an immobilized _PROTEIN_ c terminal region and radiolabeled _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ peptide fragments were used to assess in vitro binding . the c terminal brct domain of either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ specifically interacted with immobilized glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . a strong interaction is indicated because a significant portion of the labeled cpl peptides remained associated with _PROTEIN_ after elution with m nacl . these results establish that the c terminal brct containing region of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ can associate with the _PROTEIN_ c terminal region which may mediate interaction between cpl and pol ii .
