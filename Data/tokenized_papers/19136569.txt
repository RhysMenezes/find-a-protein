while the presence of a complete shikimate pathway within plant _LOCATION_ is definitively established the existence of a _LOCATION_ postchorismate portion of the pathway is still debated . this question is alimented by the presence of a _PROTEIN_ mutase within the _LOCATION_ . until now the only known destiny of prephenate the product of cm is incorporation into tyrosine and/or phenylalanine . therefore the presence of a _LOCATION_ cm suggests that enzymes involved downstream of cm in tyr or phe biosynthesis could be present within the _LOCATION_ of plant cells . it was thus of particular interest to clarify the subcellular localization of arogenate dehydrogenases and arogenate dehydratases which catalyze the ultimate steps in tyr and phe biosynthesis respectively . the aim of this study was to address this question in arabidopsis by analysis of the subcellular localization of the two tyraats and the six atadts . this article excludes the occurrence of a spliced transcript encoding a _LOCATION_ tyra protein . transient _PROTEIN_ analyses of tyra and adt green _METHOD_ protein fusions reveal that the two arabidopsis tyra proteins and the six adt proteins are all targeted within the _LOCATION_ . accordingly tyra and adt proteins were both immunodetected in the chloroplast soluble protein fraction of arabidopsis . no tyra or adt proteins were immunodetected in the _LOCATION_ of arabidopsis cells . taken together all our data exclude the possibility of tyr and/or phe synthesis within the _LOCATION_ at least in green leaves and arabidopsis cultured cells .
in contrast to which is formed by only one exon contains three exons encoding two tyra catalytic domains . this particular structure opens the possibility of generating a _LOCATION_ tyra protein . indeed three potential _PROTEIN_ initiation codons in frame with the orf are present in the region of the first one _PROTEIN_ in the first exon the second one _PROTEIN_ in the first intron and the third one _PROTEIN_ at the beginning of the second exon . prediction software chlorop or targetp reveal that the first two _PROTEIN_ codons _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ would initiate orfs containing putative _LOCATION_ transit peptide but _PROTEIN_ would initiate a protein devoid of _LOCATION_ transit peptide . identification of the transcription start site was carried out by _PROTEIN_ experiments . all of the clones obtained by _PROTEIN_ included exon confirming that _PROTEIN_ was the sole transcription start of . splicing of exon could in theory initiate a transcript encoding a tyra protein corresponding to devoid of _LOCATION_ transit peptide . however no in frame _PROTEIN_ codon initiating this protein by a splicing event respecting the _PROTEIN_ rules of intron borders could be identified in the nucleotide sequence of the gene . absence of exon splicing events was confirmed by _PROTEIN_ and northern blot experiments . all of the clones obtained by _PROTEIN_ using a reverse primer matching exon revealed correct splicing of the second intron and the presence of exon . accordingly northern blot analysis of transcripts from young arabidopsis seedlings by hybridization of total rnas with a radiolabeled probe matching exon reveals the presence of a single transcript of to kb corresponding to the expected size of the full length mrna . no signal corresponding to a spliced mrna constituted by exons and could be detected . to exclude any other posttranscriptional mechanism we also conducted in vitro transcription/translation studies of the full length mrna . indeed two in frame aug codons in positions and in the orf are present just upstream of the sequence encoding the second polypeptide domain of . although very unlikely due to their distance from the first aug codon alternative utilization of one of these two aug codons as a translation start would give rise to the catalytic protein . in vitro transcription/translation experiments revealed that the full length mrna of was always translated entirely and always gave rise to a kd protein corresponding to the complete protein . taken together these data exclude the presence of posttranscriptional events leading to the production of mrna encoding a protein devoid of _LOCATION_ transit peptide . we thus decided to confirm this situation by carrying out biochemical and immunological analyses of and in planta . the presence of the two tyra _METHOD_ and their respective contribution to total tyra activity from total soluble protein extract of arabidopsis leaves was analyzed . tyra activity could hardly be detected in this extract . we thus partially purified the soluble extract by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by a gel filtration purification step . total tyra activity was recovered in the to fraction of an ammonium sulfate fractionation which was then loaded onto a gel filtration column . as shown in figure total tyra activity was recovered in two separate peaks of activity from the gel filtration column . the first peak corresponds to a protein eluted in the void volume of the gel filtration column indicating that the corresponding tyra protein behaves as an oligomer with an apparent molecular _METHOD_ higher than kd . the second tyra peak of activity is consistent with a tyra protein of an apparent molecular _METHOD_ of to kd . these results are in agreement with our previous biochemical studies carried out on purified recombinant and overproduced in e. coli cells . in this previous study the purified recombinant eluted in the void volume of the gel filtration column whereas the purified recombinant eluted with a mobility consistent with a protein of kd . therefore in this article the first peak of activity was attributed to and the second one to . this was further confirmed by a western blot analysis of the two peaks using polyclonal antibodies raised against the recombinant and proteins . under our assay conditions affinity purified antibody used in this study was specific to proteins and did not cross react with recombinant .western blot analyses carried out on the first peak of activity by antibodies raised against revealed the presence of only one peptide of kd . no peptide was detected using antibodies raised against confirming that the first peak of activity corresponds to . a western blot analysis carried out on the second peak of activity using antibodies raised against revealed only one peptide of kd . no peptide of kd corresponding to was detected by antibodies confirming that the second peak of activity corresponds to . the apparent mobility on the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of this protein is consistent with an entire protein formed by the association of its two catalytic domains and . no traces of proteolytic cleavage of protein leading to and could be detected in any fraction eluted from the gel filtration column using antibodies which were able to immunodetect recombinant protein . this biochemical analysis revealed that in arabidopsis leaves both and are present and functional . their elution into two separate peaks of activity allowed us to calculate their respective contribution to the total tyra activity recovered from arabidopsis leaves . total activity was found twice as high as activity . these data also confirm the absence of a tyra protein corresponding to . chloroplastic tyra activity was previously reported however none of these studies examined its possible presence within the _LOCATION_ . sequence comparison with the synechocystis enzyme shows that both and have n terminal extensions . analysis of these n terminal extensions by prediction _METHOD_ such as targetp or chlorop revealed that both and n terminal extensions have characteristics of putative _LOCATION_ transit peptides . furthermore the apparent molecular _METHOD_ of the peptides revealed by western blot immunodetection in arabidopsis leaf extracts is consistent with processed proteins . to confirm these predictions and to definitively clarify the subcellular localization of the two tyra proteins in arabidopsis we conducted transient _PROTEIN_ of the two tyra proteins fused to the _METHOD_ in arabidopsis protoplasts . as shown in figure the _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ resulted in punctuate patterns of green _METHOD_ colocalized with the red _METHOD_ of chlorophyll . this pattern is similar to the one observed with _METHOD_ fused to the _LOCATION_ transit peptide sequences of the biotin holocarboxylase synthetase from arabidopsis but is clearly distinct from the green _METHOD_ spread throughout the cytoplasm that is observed with _METHOD_ alone . this analysis revealed that the two tyra proteins are both exclusively targeted within the _LOCATION_ . furthermore the transient _PROTEIN_ of the fusion protein _METHOD_ which gives rise only to chloroplastic punctuated pattern of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ confirmed the absence of any proteolytic cleavage leading to a _LOCATION_ protein . as a complementary approach we investigated the subcellular distribution of tyra proteins in arabidopsis by western blot immunodetection using polyclonal antibodies raised against purified recombinant arabidopsis tyra proteins . to overcome the difficulty in immunodetection of endogenous proteins due to their low abundance a sensitive _METHOD_ detection system was used . intact chloroplasts from arabidopsis rosette leaves were purified on percoll density gradients providing chloroplasts devoid of contamination from the other compartments . a highly enriched _LOCATION_ fraction was also prepared with < of stromal contamination based on enzymatic markers . the total soluble protein fraction the soluble protein fraction from purified chloroplasts and the _LOCATION_ enriched protein fractions were then analyzed with a mixture of affinity purified antibodies raised against the recombinant and proteins . as shown in figure antibodies raised against the recombinant and proteins revealed two labeled bands of about and kd in the stroma fraction of arabidopsis chloroplasts corresponding to the and proteins respectively . these two proteins are slightly detectable in the total soluble protein extract in good agreement with the low activity detected in the total soluble protein extract . as expected for _LOCATION_ proteins the signal in the stroma fraction was to times as high as in the crude extract . in contrast no immunological signal could be detected in the _LOCATION_ enriched fraction . these results confirmed that the two tyra proteins are _LOCATION_ proteins in arabidopsis . our data thus definitively exclude the presence of a _LOCATION_ tyra protein and consequently of any postchorismate synthesis of tyr within the _LOCATION_ . the presence of several _METHOD_ is a common feature of enzymes involved in the shikimate pathway . to complete our knowledge on the two arabidopsis tyras we evaluated the relative abundance of and transcripts in various plant organs by means of real time quantitative reverse transcription pcr experiments . each tyra gene is _PROTEIN_ in all organs tested at similar levels except in seeds where both transcripts are more abundant . the relative amount of mrna was about times higher than that of mrna in all organs examined . a very similar pattern was also observed for the arabidopsis ecotype columbia using the freely available microarray database in genevestigator . taken together our data revealed that the two arabidopsis tyra genes are constitutively _PROTEIN_ and encode _LOCATION_ proteins which both contribute to the overall arabidopsis tyra activity . as for tyras previous biochemical studies on adts report activities within the chloroplast however here again none of these studies examined their possible presence within the _LOCATION_ . among the six arabidopsis adts only _PROTEIN_ n terminal extension is not clearly recognized as a putative _LOCATION_ transit peptide by protein targeting prediction software like chlorop or targetp . furthermore in a recent study citation report that activity was regulated by blue light via protein protein interaction with the g protein subunit _PROTEIN_ which is likely to be involved in many processes critical for plant development including blue light response . this protein protein interaction implies that should be present within the _LOCATION_ because _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein . accordingly in their study the authors present as a _LOCATION_ protein which catalyzes prephenate dehydratase activity . this subcellular assumption based only on an in silico analysis of the n terminal sequence was quite surprising because the n terminal sequence is predicted to contain a putative _LOCATION_ transit peptide by chlorop and targetp . to clarify the subcellular localization of the six adts in arabidopsis we conducted transient _PROTEIN_ of the six adt proteins fused to the n terminus of the _METHOD_ in arabidopsis protoplasts . as shown in figure in all cases the _PROTEIN_ of the six atadt _METHOD_ fusions resulted in punctuate patterns of green _METHOD_ colocalized with the red _METHOD_ of chlorophyll but clearly distinct from the green _METHOD_ spread throughout the cytoplasm that is observed with _METHOD_ alone . all six arabidopsis adts are thus targeted within the _LOCATION_ of arabidopsis cells . as a complementary approach western blot immunodetection of adt proteins was conducted using total soluble protein extract chloroplast soluble protein extract and highly enriched _LOCATION_ fraction from arabidopsis cells . arabidopsis subfractions were analyzed with affinity purified antibody raised against purified recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein which cross reacts with the six recombinant _METHOD_ . as shown in figure immunopurified antibody revealed only one labeled band of about to kd in the total soluble protein extract and in the stroma fraction of arabidopsis chloroplasts . as expected for _LOCATION_ proteins the signal in the stroma fraction was to times as high as in the crude extract . furthermore the molecular _METHOD_ of the labeled band corresponds well to the expected size of mature adts when it could be predicted . no signal could be detected in the _LOCATION_ enriched fraction revealing the absence of any adt within the _LOCATION_ of arabidopsis cultured cells . the presence of only one labeled band in the stroma could either indicate that all six adt mature proteins have similar molecular _METHOD_ and could not be distinguished on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and/or that not all adt are present in sufficient quantity in chloroplast stroma to be detected . nevertheless the absence of any _LOCATION_ signal and the presence of a strong chloroplastic signal confirm the adt _METHOD_ fusion data indicating that the all six adt proteins are _LOCATION_ proteins . taken together our data definitively exclude any postchorismate synthesis of phe within the _LOCATION_ in arabidopsis at least in green leaves and cultured cells . these results are in apparent contradiction with the work reported by citation revealing a protein protein interaction between and _PROTEIN_ leading to the activation of the prephenate dehydratase activity sustained by . this prephenate dehydratase activity _METHOD_ difficult to reconcile with the biochemical characterization of activity as strictly arogenate dependent reported by citation . the protein protein interaction between and _PROTEIN_ is a very interesting observation which according to our current knowledge is difficult to interpret . it remains possible that the different models used versus etiolated arabidopsis seedlings submitted to blue light in their study could explain this discrepancy in both activity and subcellular localization . quantitative pcr data confirm that as observed by citation using northern blot analyses the six _METHOD_ are all _PROTEIN_ at the mrna level in all arabidopsis organs . however our analysis reveals that the pattern of _PROTEIN_ of the six atadts differs greatly depending on the organ considered . _PROTEIN_ is the more abundant isoform in both leaves and seeds . this isoform is also well represented in _METHOD_ and roots but less _PROTEIN_ in flowers and siliques . this result is in good agreement with a recent study of the arabidopsis _LOCATION_ proteome revealing that _PROTEIN_ is the sole isoform of adt clearly identified by master peptides . this adt isoform could have a specific role in _PROTEIN_ the housekeeping needs of phe in arabidopsis . interestingly and mrnas which belong to the same subgroup are clearly more abundantly _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ and roots compared to leaves flowers siliques and seeds . a previous study aimed at the identification of candidate genes triggering lignin biosynthesis and modification also highlighted that the gene encoding is strongly up regulated during stem elongation . analyses of freely available microarray databases are in good agreement with our quantitative rt pcr analyses revealing that genes encoding and are up regulated during stem and root development . interestingly these microarray data revealed that they are both specifically down regulated by treatment with the herbicide isoxaben an inhibitor of cellulose biosynthesis . these two genes are also strongly up regulated during biotic stress . all these data suggest coordinated _PROTEIN_ of the genes encoding and together with other genes of the shikimate pathway and the phenylpropanoid pathway for the synthesis of lignin and plant defense phenylpropanoids .
