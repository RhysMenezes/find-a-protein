the phytohormone abscisic acid plays an essential role in plant development and during the response of the plant to abiotic stress . in this study we report that the type transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is involved in the regulation of aba signaling . arabidopsis mutants lacking _PROTEIN_ are hypersensitive to aba during germination and seedling growth . a substitution in _PROTEIN_ blocks its sumo ligase _PROTEIN_ mediated sumoylation in arabidopsis protoplasts indicating that _PROTEIN_ is sumoylated by _PROTEIN_ and that is the principal site for small ubiquitin like modifier conjugation . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ partially rescues the mutant aba hypersensitive phenotype but _PROTEIN_ of wild type _PROTEIN_ complements the mutant phenotype . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ in wild type results in an aba insensitive phenotype whereas overexpression of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant does not alter _PROTEIN_ hypersensitivity to aba . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant exhibits greater aba sensitivity than either single mutant but a mutation in the _PROTEIN_ sumoylated _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ suppresses the aba hypersensitivity of _PROTEIN_ to wild type levels . our results suggest that coordination of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ sumoylation by _PROTEIN_ may balance gene _PROTEIN_ which is required for regulation of aba signaling during seed germination .
to identify components of aba signaling in arabidopsis we screened a t dna insertion pool for changes in seed germination in the presence of exogenous aba and identified the mutant which was hypersensitive to aba . insertion of the t dna fragment in the mutant was detected in exon one of _GENE_ which encodes the _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ that has previously been shown to be involved in plant defense responses . as a result was renamed as _PROTEIN_ . the phenotype of _PROTEIN_ an allelic mutant obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center _PROTEIN_ was similar to that of _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was abolished in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . germination and primary root growth of the _PROTEIN_ mutants was hypersensitive to aba compared with these processes in wild type . cotyledon greenness of the _PROTEIN_ mutants was also sensitive to mannitol . because there was no significant difference in seedling growth and leaf water loss under osmotic/drought stress between the mutant and wild type mutant sensitivity to mannitol postgermination provides additional evidence that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ functions in regulation of seed germination and very early seedling development . to determine if _PROTEIN_ functions in previously identified aba signaling pathways we crossed _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . double mutants of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ exhibited enhanced aba sensitivity relative to their single mutants suggesting that _PROTEIN_ functions in parallel pathways with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ during aba signaling . double mutants of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ exhibited an aba insensitive phenotype similar to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutants suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are epistatic to _PROTEIN_ . however double mutants of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ exhibited a wild type like phenotype during seed germination suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may function in parallel pathways to coordinately regulate aba signaling . _PROTEIN_ has been shown to regulate defense and brassinosteroid responses by mediating the _PROTEIN_ of genes involved in very long chain fatty acid biosynthesis and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transcriptional activator in br signaling respectively . to determine if _PROTEIN_ also regulates _PROTEIN_ target genes in response to aba _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was examined in myb mutants no significant difference was observed between wild type and _PROTEIN_ . consistent with these results the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ did not change in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was not affected by the _PROTEIN_ mutation . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ regulate different sets of genes and that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ do not regulate each other . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was reduced by aba treatment . aba induces the _PROTEIN_ of many plant genes associated with germination and dehydration responses . to identify aba responsive genes regulated by _PROTEIN_ wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings were treated with aba for h and aba responsive gene _PROTEIN_ was examined by solexa mrna sequencing analysis . the _PROTEIN_ of vs. genes was induced and reduced fold in _PROTEIN_ compared with _PROTEIN_ in wild type . _PROTEIN_ differences of four stress responsive genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were confirmed by real time pcr . in the _PROTEIN_ mutant the induction of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was substantially lower and the induction of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was significantly higher than their _PROTEIN_ in wild type . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was regulated in the opposite manner by aba in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . consistent with the seed germination phenotype in single and double _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in response to aba in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant was similar to that in wild type suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may work in parallel to regulate the balance of gene _PROTEIN_ during aba signaling . okada et al . used sumo and enzymes to reconstitute the arabidopsis sumoylation cascade in escherichia coli and showed that the of _PROTEIN_ was the major sumoylation site . to determine if _PROTEIN_ is sumoylated in arabidopsis and if the target is we generated myc _PROTEIN_ flag _PROTEIN_ flag _PROTEIN_ flag _PROTEIN_ and flag _PROTEIN_ constructs . myc _PROTEIN_ plasmid was cotransformed with these flag _PROTEIN_ plasmids individually into wild type protoplasts . _PROTEIN_ conjugation of _PROTEIN_ was detected in protein extracts isolated from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but not in _PROTEIN_ . these results indicate that the sumoylation of _PROTEIN_ occurs in arabidopsis at residue . to examine if sumoylation of _PROTEIN_ is required for its function in aba signaling we transferred flag _PROTEIN_ or flag _PROTEIN_ plasmids into _PROTEIN_ plants . two transgenic lines with equivalent _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ were tested for aba sensitivity . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ rescued the _PROTEIN_ aba sensitive phenotype however _PROTEIN_ of an equivalent amount of _PROTEIN_ only partially reduced _PROTEIN_ aba sensitivity suggesting that sumoylation of is critical for _PROTEIN_ function during aba signaling . _PROTEIN_ is a sumo ligase identified in arabidopsis and shown to play an important role in responses to aba through sumoylation of _PROTEIN_ . our results showing that _PROTEIN_ is sumoylated in arabidopsis and works in parallel with _PROTEIN_ suggested that _PROTEIN_ may also be a target for _PROTEIN_ . to test this hypothesis myc _PROTEIN_ and flag _PROTEIN_ or flag _PROTEIN_ were transferred into either wild type or _PROTEIN_ protoplasts and the sumoylation of _PROTEIN_ was monitored . sumoylation was detected in wild type but not in the _PROTEIN_ mutant demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ modulates the sumoylation of _PROTEIN_ . to determine if _PROTEIN_ dependent sumoylation of _PROTEIN_ is critical for the response of the plant to aba we generated the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant and _PROTEIN_ flag _PROTEIN_ in wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants . the double mutant exhibited enhanced aba sensitivity compared with either single mutant . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ in wild type resulted in transgenic plants that were insensitive to aba during germination however overexpression of _PROTEIN_ at a similar level in _PROTEIN_ did not affect the aba sensitive phenotype of the mutant . the aba sensitive phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutant may be because of the activation of _PROTEIN_ and inactivation of _PROTEIN_ . in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant is absent and _PROTEIN_ is activated therefore the double mutant would be expected to be more sensitive to aba than either single mutant . sumoylation plays a role in protein protein interaction protein subcellular localization enzymatic activity and stability . to determine the biological function of _PROTEIN_ sumoylation we _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in wild type protoplasts . both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized to the _LOCATION_ . to examine if sumoylation changes _PROTEIN_ transcriptional activity the arabidopsis proteins were _PROTEIN_ in yeast as previously reported . the _PROTEIN_ mutation did not significantly affect _PROTEIN_ transcriptional activity in yeast . the flag _PROTEIN_ transgenic wild type and _PROTEIN_ lines were then used to determine if sumoylation affects the stability of _PROTEIN_ . the sumoylation of _PROTEIN_ was not significantly affected by aba treatment however in the presence of aba _PROTEIN_ was less abundant in the _PROTEIN_ seedlings than in the wild type seedlings . these data suggest that sumoylation by _PROTEIN_ stabilizes _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ bhlh _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ aba responsive genes was rescued by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but not by _PROTEIN_ . these data together with the results showing that _PROTEIN_ partially reduced _PROTEIN_ aba sensitivity suggest that sumoylation of _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ may also affect its transcriptional activity .
arabidopsis seeds were sown on murashige and skoog _METHOD_ medium with agar kept in the dark for d at to break dormancy and then grown in a growth chamber at in constant light . to monitor aba sensitivity seeds were sown on _METHOD_ medium or _METHOD_ medium containing the indicated concentrations of aba . germination frequencies were obtained by scoring green cotyledons for an average of seeds from three independent experiments _PROTEIN_ . stable wt _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines were used to monitor aba induced _PROTEIN_ degradation . eight day old seedlings were treated with water or aba for or h. seedlings were homogenized on ices in extraction buffer _METHOD_ . extracts were centrifuged at g for min at and the resulting supernatant was used to detect _PROTEIN_ levels in wild type or _PROTEIN_ seedlings by immunoblot analysis . the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ mutant was kindly provided by paul m. hasegawa . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants were obtained from the _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ coding region was cloned into the flag binary vector driven by a cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ overexpressing transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were generated using agrobacterium mediated floral transformation . rt pcr and immunoblot analysis were used to detect the abundance of the transgenes and proteins . stable wt _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines were used for phenotypic analyses . seven day old seedlings grown on _METHOD_ plates were used for aba treatments . the seedlings were harvested for rna extraction after treatment with aba for h. total rna isolation reverse transcription and quantitative real time pcr amplification were as described . the primer pairs used are shown in table . the value of wild type without aba treatment was normalized to with differences calculated as relative _PROTEIN_ . for transient _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts the _PROTEIN_ coding region was amplified and inserted into the myc plasmid to produce the myc _PROTEIN_ fusion protein . the flag _PROTEIN_ and myc _PROTEIN_ were coexpressed in wild type or _PROTEIN_ protoplasts by polyethylene glycol mediated transformation . after a h incubation at the protoplasts were harvested and lysed in ml extraction buffer . for aba treatment protoplasts were incubated with aba at for h . fifteen microliters of anti flag agarose conjugate were incubated with the extract supernatant for h at . after washing five times in ml of extraction buffer proteins were detected by immunoblot analysis . anti myc antibody was used to detect the flag _PROTEIN_ myc _PROTEIN_ conjugation . anti flag antibody was used to detect the abundance of flag _PROTEIN_ as a control .
