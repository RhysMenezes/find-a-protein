high mobility group _PROTEIN_ proteins of the _PROTEIN_ family are chromatin associated proteins that as architectural _PROTEIN_ are involved in the regulation of transcription and other dna dependent processes . _PROTEIN_ proteins are generally considered _LOCATION_ proteins although mammalian _PROTEIN_ can also be detected in the cytoplasm and outside of cells . plant _PROTEIN_ proteins studied so far were found exclusively in the cell _LOCATION_ . using _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ microscopy of _PROTEIN_ proteins fused to the green _METHOD_ protein we have examined the subcellular localization of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins revealing that in addition to a prominent _LOCATION_ localization they can be detected also in the cytoplasm . the nucleocytoplasmic distribution appears to depend on the cell type . by time lapse _METHOD_ microscopy it was observed that the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins tagged with photoactivatable green _METHOD_ protein can shuttle between the _LOCATION_ and the cytoplasm while _PROTEIN_ remains _LOCATION_ . the balance between the basic amino terminal and the acidic _PROTEIN_ terminal domains flanking the central _PROTEIN_ box dna binding domain critically influences the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of the _PROTEIN_ proteins . moreover protein kinase _PROTEIN_ mediated phosphorylation of the acidic tail modulates the intranuclear distribution of _PROTEIN_ . collectively our results show that in contrast to other arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ proteins such as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins occur preferentially in the cell _LOCATION_ but to various extents also in the cytoplasm .
since the subcellular localization of plant _PROTEIN_ proteins has not been examined systematically we raised an antiserum against arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ whose distribution has not been studied in plant cells . the antibody was tested in immunoblots revealing that it reacted specifically with a protein band of the expected size of approximately kd when arabidopsis ecotype columbia leaf protein extracts were probed . when compared with an antiserum directed against arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ relative to the bands of the recombinant proteins the _PROTEIN_ band appeared markedly more prominent consistent with the higher _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ . in addition the _PROTEIN_ antiserum reacted equally well with recombinant _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as both proteins share approximately amino acid sequence identity and comigrate on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ antiserum was used for indirect _METHOD_ microscopic analyses of arabidopsis root tip cells while the _PROTEIN_ antiserum served as a reference . in line with previous experiments the _PROTEIN_ antiserum reacted specifically with interphase _LOCATION_ that were stained in parallel with diamino phenylindole . anti _PROTEIN_ signals were enhanced in heterochromatic interphase regions . conversely anti _PROTEIN_ labeled cells displayed uniformly stained interphase _LOCATION_ and additional weak _METHOD_ signals were found in the cytoplasm . dividing chromosomes were hardly stained with either anti _PROTEIN_ or anti . this finding suggests that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to some extent also occurs outside the cell _LOCATION_ . to further analyze the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we generated plasmids that could direct the _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ fusion proteins in plant cells . tobacco protoplasts were transformed with these plasmids and examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy _PROTEIN_ . the previously observed _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ served as a reference . while _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were found exclusively in the cell _LOCATION_ the _METHOD_ signals of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were detected primarily in the _LOCATION_ but to various extents also in the cytoplasm . each _METHOD_ image is shown in normal exposure and overexposed to illustrate more clearly the cytoplasmic _METHOD_ seen with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in both cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ was consistently observed for both the n and c terminal _METHOD_ fusion proteins although quantitative differences were observed in the nucleocytoplasmic distribution with different protoplasts and with n versus c terminal _METHOD_ fusions _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . these experiments showed that in contrast to the strictly _LOCATION_ proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins are also found in the cytoplasm . to examine the subcellular distribution of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in planta we generated transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins . roots of the transgenic plants were analyzed by _PROTEIN_ and compared with plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ . the primary root tip was observed and meristematic and cortical cells were inspected in more detail . consistent with previous experiments _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were detected exclusively in the _LOCATION_ of both the meristematic and cortical cells . for the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins in meristematic cells _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected preferentially in _LOCATION_ . in cortex cells the _METHOD_ fusion proteins occurred predominantly in _LOCATION_ but they were also clearly visible in the cytoplasm . the cytoplasmic _METHOD_ signal in cortex cells was observed both in the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ images and in the overlays of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and the corresponding bright field images . this experiment confirmed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ can occur in the cytoplasm and suggested that the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ varies between cells . since the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins were detected both in _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm while _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were exclusively found in _LOCATION_ the amino acid sequences of the _PROTEIN_ proteins were searched for motifs that possibly are responsible for this difference in subcellular distribution . however we were unable to identify differences in potential _LOCATION_ localization signals or _LOCATION_ export signals that could explain the observed differential localization . moreover incubation of protoplasts that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins with the inhibitor of the _LOCATION_ export receptor _PROTEIN_ leptomycin b had no effect on the subcellular distribution of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . to examine experimentally the contribution of _PROTEIN_ protein domains on the subcellular localization we constructed a variety of plasmids that direct the _PROTEIN_ of truncated and chimeric _PROTEIN_ proteins fused to _METHOD_ . tobacco protoplasts transformed with these plasmids were examined by _PROTEIN_ . for comparison the localization of full length _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ and of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ are shown . deletion of the basic n terminal domain of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ had no marked influence on the localization of the proteins when compared with the full length proteins . however deletion of the acidic c terminal domain of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ resulted in an increased accumulation of the proteins in the _LOCATION_ . replacement of the basic n terminal domains of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ by the basic n terminal domain of _PROTEIN_ caused efficient _LOCATION_ accumulation of the chimeric proteins . when the acidic c terminal domain of _PROTEIN_ was replaced by the acidic c terminal domains of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ the chimeric proteins _PROTEIN_ in addition to the _LOCATION_ were found in the cytoplasm . replacement of the acidic tails of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ by the short acidic c terminal domain of _PROTEIN_ resulted in chimeric proteins that accumulated in the _LOCATION_ . in summary the comparative analyses of the subcellular localization of these full length truncated and chimeric _PROTEIN_ proteins indicated that the basic n terminal and the acidic c terminal domains are involved in directing the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ proteins possibly by intramolecular interaction . since no amino acid sequence motif could be detected that may confer the different subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ on the one hand and of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ on the other hand the contribution of posttranslational modifications was considered . to date the only posttranslational modification that has been identified for plant _PROTEIN_ proteins is the protein kinase _PROTEIN_ mediated phosphorylation of ser/thr residues within the acidic c terminal domains of maize _PROTEIN_ proteins . when arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ proteins were tested for _PROTEIN_ mediated phosphorylation _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were readily phosphorylated while _PROTEIN_ was phosphorylated only weakly and _PROTEIN_ was not phosphorylated at all . thus the three _PROTEIN_ proteins that in addition to the _LOCATION_ are found in the cytoplasm are particularly good substrates for protein kinase _PROTEIN_ . in line with that the c terminal amino acid sequences of these proteins contain ser residues within _PROTEIN_ consensus sequences that resemble the sites known to be phosphorylated with maize _PROTEIN_ proteins while these sites do not occur in the c terminal region of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . to test whether the _PROTEIN_ mediated phosphorylation of these c terminal ser residues is involved in directing the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ the three candidate ser residues were changed to ala residues . phosphorylation assays using purified recombinant maize _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were performed with wild type _PROTEIN_ and the mutant version of _PROTEIN_ lacking the three c terminal ser residues . the substrate proteins were reacted with _PROTEIN_ for different times and as expected _PROTEIN_ was vigorously phosphorylated by the enzyme . by contrast the mutations abolished the phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ by the protein kinase . the mutant form of _PROTEIN_ along with the corresponding phosphomimic mutant fused to _METHOD_ were _PROTEIN_ in tobacco protoplasts and analyzed by _PROTEIN_ in comparison with wild type _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the wild type and mutant _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed a similar nucleocytoplasmic distribution but in contrast to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ which often showed _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the nucleolus this effect was never seen with the mutant versions of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . in addition the and mutant versions of _PROTEIN_ displayed a more pronounced speckled pattern of _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ . thus _PROTEIN_ mediated phosphorylation did not appear to influence the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of _PROTEIN_ but it modulated the protein localization within the cell _LOCATION_ . the occurrence of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in both _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm raised the possibility that these proteins can shuttle between the two locations . to test this possibility _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fused to photoactivatable _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were _PROTEIN_ in tobacco protoplasts and examined by multifocal two photon laser scanning microscopy . the dynamics of the diffusion of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ was recorded before and at different times during and after activation of the _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ . for both _METHOD_ fusion proteins over time a _PROTEIN_ of _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ was observed . in parallel an increase of _METHOD_ was seen in the cytoplasm . this demonstrated that significant amounts of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ can migrate from the _LOCATION_ to the cytoplasm within the analyzed period . when _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ was examined in parallel no cytoplasmic _METHOD_ was observed indicating that in line with previous experiments _PROTEIN_ remained in the _LOCATION_ and could not migrate to the cytoplasm . to study the migration from cytoplasm to the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ fused to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was activated in a small area of the cytoplasm and the _METHOD_ was recorded over time . this experiment showed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ first spread from the activation site in the cytoplasm and consistent with their preferential _LOCATION_ localization in the following they accumulated in the cell _LOCATION_ . monitoring the distribution of _METHOD_ fused to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ demonstrated that both proteins can shuttle between the _LOCATION_ and the cytoplasm whereas _PROTEIN_ remained _LOCATION_ localized .
