the arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes several families of polypeptides that are known or predicted to participate in the formation of the scf class of ubiquitin ligase complexes . one such gene family encodes the _PROTEIN_ like class of polypeptide subunits where genes have been identified and are known to be _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . phylogenetic analysis based on deduced polypeptide sequence organizes the family of ask proteins into clades . the complexity of the ask gene family together with the close structural similarity among its members raises the prospect of significant functional redundancy among select paralogs . we have assessed the potential for functional redundancy within the ask gene family by analyzing an expanded set of criteria that define redundancy with higher resolution . the criteria used include quantitative _PROTEIN_ of locus specific transcripts using qrt pcr assessment of the sub cellular localization of individual ask _METHOD_ auto _METHOD_ fusion proteins _PROTEIN_ in vivo as well as the in planta assessment of individual ask f box protein interactions using bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation techniques in combination with confocal imagery in live cells . the results indicate significant functional divergence of steady state transcript abundance and protein protein interaction specificity involving ask proteins in a pattern that is poorly predicted by sequence based phylogeny . the information emerging from this and related studies will prove important for defining the functional intersection of _PROTEIN_ localization and gene product interaction that better predicts the formation of discrete scf complexes as a prelude to investigating their molecular mode of action .
a phylogenetic analysis of relatedness within the ask gene family of arabidopsis reveals that the members of this gene family fall into distinct clades when clustered on the basis of primary deduced amino acid sequence as summarized in . this clustering of the predicted ask proteins is consistent with published results where _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are grouped within a clade and were found to overlap functionally and are known to be essential for early development in arabidopsis . we used this phylogenetic tree as a basis to assess the functional relatedness among ask paralogs as measured by three functional criteria tissue/organ specific transcript abundance sub cellular localization of _METHOD_ tagged ask proteins and the protein protein interaction profiles of ask proteins in conjunction with selected f box proteins _PROTEIN_ as bifc fusion constructs . the phylogenetic grouping of ask genes based on their deduced primary amino acid sequence was calculated using the nj method described . the genes are grouped into seven distinct clades as denoted by the vertical lines . numbers at the branches represents percentage bootstrap support calculated for a replicates . all tree branches are scaled to the number of amino acid substations per site . a qrt pcr analysis of transcript abundance was undertaken for members of the ask gene family which reside in common phylogenetic clades based on their primary deduced amino acid sequence _PROTEIN_ . included were two genes known to be associated with scf type ub function _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as well as tubulin and _PROTEIN_ as internal reference controls . we were unable to design unique qrt pcr primers capable of distinguishing _PROTEIN_ from _PROTEIN_ transcripts due to the high dna sequence similarity between these two genes . thus for purposes of this study a single primer pair for _PROTEIN_ was used . transcript specific primers and their associated genomic identifiers are listed in tables and . transcript abundance was quantified in cdna preparations constructed from total rna fractions prepared from rosette leaves of plants prior to stage roots of day old seedlings green _METHOD_ green siliques with seeds _PROTEIN_ whole day old seedlings old stage whole flowers _PROTEIN_ from day old plants and stage whole flowers from day old plants . quantitative rt pcr analysis and cdna measurements were the result of independent experiments involving biological replicate samples for each as summarized in where data for each gene/organ combination are shown and clustered on the basis of their relative _PROTEIN_ abundance across all biological samples analyzed . rna from the indicated organs was isolated and used to assess ask gene _PROTEIN_ as described in the . organs examined were day old seedlings stage leaves green stem green siliques stage flowers and stage flowers . gene _PROTEIN_ is depicted in mne units _PROTEIN_ after normalization . data are means of two independent biological repetitions _PROTEIN_ . b cluster summary of the pearson based hierarchical clustering of ask gene _PROTEIN_ among select organs . the colors represent genes within the different phylogenetic clades as defined within . from this analysis and in agreement with previously published studies the relative abundance of mrnas for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were found to be elevated and constant in comparison to other ask genes across all biological organs examined . however for the common clade comprised of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the transcripts for these two genes were found to be _PROTEIN_ at markedly different steady state levels where the abundance of _PROTEIN_ mrna was consistently an order of magnitude higher in all organs examined except siliques . moreover the relative _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was found to be elevated in reproductive organs in comparison to other organs whereas _PROTEIN_ mrna abundance was relatively constant across all organs examined . when _PROTEIN_ as the ratio relative to whole seedling organs _PROTEIN_ mrna was found to be fold more abundant in green siliques and was elevated in stage and stage flowers excised from day old plants . in contrast the _PROTEIN_ ratio for _PROTEIN_ mrna was found to be only modestly elevated in these same organs . all gene _PROTEIN_ was normalized relative to _PROTEIN_ . a relative abundance of ask gene cdnas in flowers from stage plants relative to seedlings . b relative abundance of ask cdnas in stage flowers relative to seedlings . c relative _PROTEIN_ of ask genes in siliques relative to seedlings . a distinct _PROTEIN_ pattern was observed within the clade comprised of _PROTEIN_ where _PROTEIN_ transcripts were found to have a relatively higher abundance in foliar tissues and the silique . _PROTEIN_ transcripts were not detectable in the organs examined whereas its close paralog _PROTEIN_ albeit lower than _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ measurable transcripts in all organs examined . although _PROTEIN_ has been suggested in the literature to be a pseudogene we think this is unlikely since _PROTEIN_ cdna has been enriched from a low abundance rna library and the corresponding clone is available from the _PROTEIN_ stock center _PROTEIN_ . within the phylogenetic clade defined by _PROTEIN_ all four gene transcripts were found to be relatively abundant in tissues from _PROTEIN_ stage flowers and siliques whereas their abundance was relatively low in earlier flowers compared to seedlings . the _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ pattern was unique among genes defining the _PROTEIN_ clade in that it exhibited a conspicuously lower relative transcript level compared to the other genes in the clade . for the clade defined by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts were _PROTEIN_ at a relatively low and constant level with a modest increase in abundance in stage and stage flowers . interestingly the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ most closely resembled that of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in light of their constant level of _PROTEIN_ throughout development of arabidopsis . the lowest transcript level in comparison to all other ask genes studied was observed for _PROTEIN_ which co reside within the clade comprising _PROTEIN_ . however transcripts for these two genes showed a distinct _PROTEIN_ pattern between them in that _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ only in roots and siliques whereas _PROTEIN_ similar to _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ preferentially in early stages of flower development followed by a decline in transcript abundance at _PROTEIN_ stages of flower maturation and silique development . the data underlying the observed pattern of relative abundance of mrnas for each ask gene across all organ sources examined was submitted to clustering analysis with the resulting grouping presented in . the data indicate that _PROTEIN_ and ask are similar with respect to the relative abundance of their respective transcripts and their pattern of _PROTEIN_ across the organs examined . in this analysis _PROTEIN_ mrna abundance in the organ samples assessed was distinct from _PROTEIN_ as its closest primary sequence paralog in arabidopsis . it should be noted that several deviations were observed between the _PROTEIN_ data here versus the microarray data available through several databases such as bio array and . in those instances where deviations were observed such variations could be attributed to the probes used in the microarray construction . for instance and in contrast to our findings closely related genes such as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as well as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ exhibit identical _PROTEIN_ behaviour when measured using microarray approaches where the results can be explained by the use of probes that did not distinguish between the mrnas encoded by these two genes . one explanation for the presence of the large number of ask proteins in arabidopsis could be a corresponding diversity of sub cellular localization for some of the ask proteins . a study was therefore undertaken to evaluate the sub cellular localization profile of selected ask proteins _PROTEIN_ as functional fusions with the _METHOD_ auto _METHOD_ protein in transgenic arabidopsis . the _METHOD_ ask fusion proteins were _PROTEIN_ from camv promoter constructs assembled and transformed into arabidopsis as described and the results are summarized in . propidium iodide _PROTEIN_ staining was used to visualize cell walls and general morphology in whole mounts of roots and day old seedling leaf epidermal cells including guard cells . the signal arising from chlorophyll auto _METHOD_ is shown in . in parallel cellular _PROTEIN_ and sub cellular localization of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein is shown in and the composite _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ images is shown in . taken together and in agreement with previous studies described for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ proteins accumulate in both the _LOCATION_ and the cytoplasm in epidermal leaf cells of arabidopsis . we observed no overlap between the _METHOD_ and chlorophyll auto _METHOD_ signals suggesting that the extra _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein does not detectably localize to the chloroplast and largely accumulates in the cytoplasm . propidium iodide stained epidermal root cell walls or leaf epidermal cell walls and guard cell _LOCATION_ . b chlorophyll auto _METHOD_ from the leaf mesophyll cell layer . d f stable _PROTEIN_ of n terminal _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ protein in transgenic arabidopsis . g i merged channels corresponding to panels and . this same pattern of _METHOD_ fusion protein accumulation in the _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm with no significant localization to chloroplasts was reiterated across all other _METHOD_ ask gene fusions assessed _PROTEIN_ with the exception of _PROTEIN_ . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein fusion when _PROTEIN_ in transgenic arabidopsis was found to apparently aggregate predominantly in the _LOCATION_ of epidermal leaf cells resulting in highly localized and intense _METHOD_ signals . notably these aggregates were not observed in root tissues of the same transgenic lines . in order to investigate whether the apparent aggregation of _PROTEIN_ was the result of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ over _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ of this fusion was compared to that of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein using western blot analysis . as shown in the level of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in three independent lines was qualitatively lower than that of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein . although ask sub cellular localization resembles that of _METHOD_ sub cellular localization the lack of available ask protein specific antibodies precludes the possibility of taking immunohistochemical approaches to localizing nascent ask proteins in situ . however we noted that the majority of reported scf substrates in arabidopsis are known transcription _PROTEIN_ which is consistent with our observation of a general _LOCATION_ localization of _METHOD_ ask fusion proteins . to investigate whether n terminal fusions could mask nascent localization signals c terminal _METHOD_ fusion constructs using the _PROTEIN_ coding region were generated and a similar localization pattern was observed following transient _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana leaves . in addition we asked whether other known scf ligase subunits exhibited a similar localization pattern to ask proteins suggesting the potential for co localization and participation in scf complex assembly . upon assessing the localization pattern of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as c terminal _METHOD_ fusions we found that a similar localization was observed relative to the _METHOD_ ask protein studies described above . previous studies have shown that individual protein products of the ask gene family exhibit both general as well as specific protein protein interactions involving select f box proteins when assessed in the heterologous yeast hybrid system . this property of generalized versus specific f box protein interaction capability is of importance for determining which specific ask polypeptides are capable of interacting with specific f box proteins with implications for the combinatorial diversity of scf ub complexes that could form in vivo involving subunit polypeptides of either class . accordingly we undertook to analyze the in situ interaction of polypeptides encoded by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in combination with a selected panel of f box proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ known to participate in scf complex assembly . these proteins are involved in the regulation of diverse aspects of plant development such as auxin sensing circadian rhythm _PROTEIN_ ethylene sensing patterning and development . protein interactions were assessed as the reconstitution of _METHOD_ signal upon co _PROTEIN_ of all pair wise combinations of split _METHOD_ fusion _PROTEIN_ constructs assembled as described in the and subsequently _PROTEIN_ through co infection of agrobacterium containing constructs in the high fidelity n. benthamiana transient _PROTEIN_ system . the data for a subset of pair wise combinations of ask f box interactions are summarized in with the exception of _PROTEIN_ which is shown in . visualization of bifc based sub cellular protein interactions between select ask and f box proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana epidermal leaf cells _METHOD_ signal indicates a positive interaction chlorophyll auto _METHOD_ is shown in red . a h protein interactions between _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ proteins _PROTEIN_ as bifc fusion _PROTEIN_ constructs . i p protein interactions between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins _PROTEIN_ as bifc fusion _PROTEIN_ constructs . q the indicated interaction map was developed as described in the and summarizes the results obtained following transient _PROTEIN_ of bifc constructs in n. benthamiana leaf epidermal cells . edge lines joining nodes represent a positive interaction . with respect to protein interactions involving _PROTEIN_ five ask polypeptides _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were found to interact with _PROTEIN_ in vivo . interestingly the interaction signal observed was predominantly localized to the _LOCATION_ in leaf epidermal cells . similarly _PROTEIN_ fusion products involving _PROTEIN_ and were found to interact with _PROTEIN_ in a pattern that was analogous to _PROTEIN_ . although closely related at the primary amino acid sequence level with _PROTEIN_ split _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ constructs involving _PROTEIN_ did not detectably interact in vivo with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . the results summarizing binary protein interactions involving the remaining f box ask combinations are depicted in the interaction map shown in . for all protein interactions involving _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ signal was restricted to the _LOCATION_ whereas all other f box ask protein combinations were observed in both the cytoplasm and the _LOCATION_ . also noteworthy was the finding that _PROTEIN_ interacted with _PROTEIN_ in the split _METHOD_ system but not with _PROTEIN_ notwithstanding the high degree of deduced primary amino acid sequence similarity between these two ask polypeptides . considering that all ask and f box proteins tested were found to interact with at least one other binding partner we concluded that the observed negative interacting protein combinations were biologically significant and were not due to low levels of protein _PROTEIN_ . to confirm that protein _PROTEIN_ among the observed negative interacting combinations was comparable to that of positive interacting proteins we cloned select f box and ask coding domains into a second set of bifc vectors where the split _METHOD_ coding region incorporated c myc and ha tag domains thus facilitating comparative protein _PROTEIN_ studies via western blot analysis . as shown in from the select proteins investigated all were _PROTEIN_ to levels qualitatively comparable to that of the positive interacting proteins indicating that the observed negative interactions were not due to the lack of protein _PROTEIN_ .

cdna clones were cloned into _METHOD_ resulting in the _METHOD_ f box set of constructs . a complete list of the vectors used is summarized in table . in those instances where the entry clone and destination plasmid backbone carried the same selection marker for cloning purposes of the pentry plasmid was initially digested and counter selected by restriction digestion with mlui prior to input to the lr clonase reaction . correct _PROTEIN_ of the desired bifc fusion products was independently evaluated in n. benthamiana leaves by construction transformation and _PROTEIN_ of select ask and f box fusions in the pe _PROTEIN_ gw and pe _PROTEIN_ gw gateway compatible bifc vectors harboring myc and ha tags at the n terminus of the split _METHOD_ domain respectively . the _METHOD_ ask

the blots were incubated with either anti ha or anti c myc antibodies at a dilution in skim milk powder in tbst overnight at . blots were washed times with tbst for min and incubated with secondary antibody at a dilution in skim milk/tbst for h at room temperature . blots were subsequently washed and exposed using pico west and imaged using an alphaimager device . all bifc vectors were transformed into agrobacterium tumefaciens strain _PROTEIN_ by electroporation and the presence of transgenes was confirmed by in situ pcr . mixed agrobacterium cultures were co infiltrated to the abaxial surface of week old n. benthamiana plants as described . the protein of tomato bushy stunt virus was co _PROTEIN_ with all binary bifc _PROTEIN_ constructs in order to suppress gene silencing

scanning/point detection laser scanning confocal microscope . cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and propidium iodide _PROTEIN_ were excited by using and nm laser lines respectively . when using multiple fluorophores simultaneously images were acquired sequentially in order to reduce excitation and emission overlaps . olympus water immersion and uplsapo objectives were employed . image acquisition was conducted at a resolution of pixels with a scan rate of _METHOD_ per pixel . olympus _PROTEIN_ software was used for image acquisition and the export of tiff files . figures were assembled using _PROTEIN_ . total rna was isolated using a commercial mini preparation kit and contaminating dna was removed using an immobilized dnase column . two _METHOD_ of total rna was used as template for first strand cdna synthesis in a reaction using the synthesis kit . the resulting cdna was diluted and of cdna was used in a standard pcr reaction . analysis of gene _PROTEIN_ used the sybr green qpcr master mix in an applied _METHOD_ rt pcr system following the manufacturer s instructions . the primers used in the qrt pcr analyses are listed in table . to identify the optimal internal reference control tubulin and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was assessed across all organs . transcript _PROTEIN_ showed the least amount of variation across all tissues examined and was used as the internal standard in order to normalize the qrt pcr data . real time pcr results were analyzed using q gene software that _PROTEIN_ data as mean normalized _PROTEIN_ which is directly proportional to the amount of mrna of the target genes relative to the amount of mrna of the internal reference standard . in brief to calculate mne the pcr efficiency mean cycle threshold

using a blosum _PROTEIN_ with a gap penalty of an extended gap penalty of and a gap distance of . the tree was constructed using the neighbor joining method utilizing the p distance substitution method in mega and node reliability was calculated using bootstrap replicas . in order to evaluate different clustering methods for their possible effect on tree construction we compared three different methods nj maximum parsimony un weighted pair group and arithmetic mean using mega . this comparison revealed slight differences in the clustering pattern . clustering using upgma resulted in the grouping of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but not with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . however based on the chromosomal location and supporting literature we believe that _PROTEIN_ is a result of tandem duplication of _PROTEIN_ thus nj clustering was used for this study .
