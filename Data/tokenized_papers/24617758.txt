salt stress is a widespread phenomenon limiting plant performance in large areas around the world . although various types of plant sodium/proton antiporters have been characterized the physiological function of _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis thaliana has not been elucidated in detail so far . here we report that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein localizes to the chloroplast envelope . heterologous _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was sufficient to complement a salt sensitive escherichia coli mutant lacking its endogenous sodium/proton exchangers . transport competence of _PROTEIN_ was confirmed using recombinant highly purified carrier protein reconstituted into proteoliposomes proving na /h antiport . in planta _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was found to be highest in mature and senescent leaves but was not induced by sodium chloride application . when compared to wild type controls _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion mutants showed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and lower chlorophyll levels after sodium feeding . interestingly if grown on sand and supplemented with high sodium chloride _PROTEIN_ mutants exhibited leaf tissue na levels similar to those of wild type plants but the na content of chloroplasts increased significantly . these high sodium levels in mutant chloroplasts resulted in markedly impaired photosynthetic performance as revealed by a lower quantum yield of photosystem ii and increased non photochemical quenching . moreover high na levels might hamper activity of the _LOCATION_ bile acid/sodium symporter family protein _PROTEIN_ . the resulting pyruvate deficiency might cause the observed _PROTEIN_ phenylalanine levels in the _PROTEIN_ mutants due to lack of precursors .
so far chloroplast envelope localization of _PROTEIN_ has only been assumed . _PROTEIN_ and its homolog from m. crystallinum share similarity at the amino acid sequence level and the _LOCATION_ location of the latter has been demonstrated by use of a _METHOD_ fusion . however a proteomic study identified _PROTEIN_ in enriched arabidopsis _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ resulting in a need to obtain experimental data on the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ . by _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mrna construct in mesophyll protoplasts we were able to demonstrate the subcellular location of the corresponding fusion protein . after transformation of isolated arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mrna the _METHOD_ signal co localizes with the red chlorophyll auto _METHOD_ confirming a _LOCATION_ localization . the _LOCATION_ localization was confirmed in a second system by transient _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in tobacco protoplasts . to further confirm the envelope localization of _PROTEIN_ we co transformed tobacco protoplasts with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mrna encoding a _LOCATION_ associated protein phosphatase . these proteins do not show any significant co localization and the corresponding scatter plot revealed a co localization rate of only . thus localization of _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ may be excluded . the sodium transport activity of the nhad homologs from m. crystallinum and populus euphratica has been demonstrated by complementation of e. coli knockout strains lacking endogenous na /h antiporters . the e. coli strain _PROTEIN_ was transformed with a plasmid harboring _PROTEIN_ under the control of the isopropyl d thiogalactopyranoside inducible tac promoter and cell growth rates were quantified in the presence of sodium _PROTEIN_ . heterologous _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ increased the sodium tolerance of transformed _PROTEIN_ cells significantly when compared to control cells suggesting na transport competence of _PROTEIN_ . to elucidate the sodium response of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ e. coli mutants in more detail we quantified the growth over the entire h of cultivation . the presence of mm nacl leads to substantial growth inhibition of the e. coli _PROTEIN_ strain but the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ resulted in a less pronounced growth defect . increased sodium tolerance due to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ becomes particularly visible by monitoring growth of salt treated and salt untreated bacteria over time . to allow better comparison maximal growth of _PROTEIN_ bacteria and of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells was set to respectively and time dependent growth was calculated according to the corresponding controls . to obtain further independent evidence that _PROTEIN_ acts as a sodium carrier we quantified sodium levels in _PROTEIN_ cells and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells grown in the absence or presence of mm nacl . in the absence of nacl the internal sodium levels of both cell types were indistinguishable but in the presence of nacl _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ led to significantly _PROTEIN_ levels of cellular sodium after or h growth compared to _PROTEIN_ cells . the e. coli system does not allow us to analyze whether _PROTEIN_ directly mediates sodium/proton antiport . to overcome this limitation we developed a protocol allowing both biochemical purification of recombinant _PROTEIN_ synthesized in e. coli and subsequent functional reconstitution in proteoliposomes . we showed here that _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in e. coli leads to functional insertion of the recombinant carrier in the bacterial _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and that use of immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography _PROTEIN_ allowed enrichment of the decahistidine tagged _PROTEIN_ protein to high purity . the his tagged _PROTEIN_ protein had an apparent molecular _METHOD_ of approximately kda . purified his tagged _PROTEIN_ or the rabbit sarcoplasmic _LOCATION_ located _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as a control were reconstituted into artificial liposomes . a ph gradient across the proteoliposomal _LOCATION_ was created via dilution into ammonium free buffer medium resulting in acid loading . in the absence of external sodium chloride _PROTEIN_ containing proteoliposomes did not export protons as indicated by the unchanged pyranine _METHOD_ within the first sec of the experiment . however after addition of mm nacl _PROTEIN_ harboring proteoliposomes exhibited sodium import coupled to proton antiport at high rates . the concomitant increase of pyranine _METHOD_ reached saturation after approximately sec . in marked contrast control proteoliposomes reconstituted with _PROTEIN_ protein did not show detectable proton export upon sodium application confirming the specificity of _PROTEIN_ mediated na /h exchange . the specificity of _PROTEIN_ mediated sodium/proton antiport is also underlined by two further observations first the relative pyranine _METHOD_ change is dependent on the _PROTEIN_ protein concentration reconstituted in liposomes and second addition of kcl does not induce a significant pyranine _METHOD_ . to obtain further evidence that the _PROTEIN_ transport observed in intact e. coli cells is due to sodium/proton antiport we measured nacl induced ph changes in corresponding bacterial cells . in the absence of additional nacl the external medium ph of control cells and cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was similar . in contrast addition of nacl resulted in a significantly higher ph value in the medium containing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells compared with control cells . this indicates that sodium that entered the e. coli cells non specifically is re exported by _PROTEIN_ . to obtain insights into the tissue specificity of _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ quantitative rt pcr analyses were performed . _PROTEIN_ mrna levels were comparably low in seeds roots shoots flowers and developing siliques . in contrast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the leaf tissues was dependent on the developmental stage . while young leaves contained only fairly low levels of _PROTEIN_ mrna mature leaves accumulated approximately fivefold higher levels which remained constant throughout leaf senescence . higher plants possess several carrier proteins that are able to transport sodium against the electrochemical gradient . in addition to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ /h antiporter contributes to na tolerance and was shown to be induced by nacl treatment . this prompted us to compare the _PROTEIN_ pattern of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in response to sodium chloride . therefore arabidopsis plants were grown for weeks on sand and then exposed to mm nacl for days . the levels of the mrna encoding the _LOCATION_ na /h exchanger _PROTEIN_ remained constant for the first days of sodium treatment and increased fold over the next days . in contrast _PROTEIN_ levels did not change within the first days of salt stress but _PROTEIN_ approximately compared to the control after days of salt treatment . among the available arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion lines only one homozygous knockout line _PROTEIN_ was identified . the _PROTEIN_ that _PROTEIN_ mutants are viable but only heterozygous _PROTEIN_ mutants were detected suggests the existence of a second and lethal t dna insertion in _PROTEIN_ plants . to obtain a second _PROTEIN_ line homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutants were crossed with heterozygous _PROTEIN_ mutants . as backcrossing to _PROTEIN_ seeds takes place among these mutants every generation must be screened for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants by pcr or _PROTEIN_ selection . as a result _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants are still genetically related to the _PROTEIN_ mutants . to obtain a further control _PROTEIN_ plants were complemented with endogenous arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ cdna driven by the promoter and fused to venus at the end to verify _LOCATION_ localization in planta . after screening independent _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants three independent lines were isolated that exhibited and fold increased _PROTEIN_ mrna levels compared to wild type . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants were used to determine _LOCATION_ sodium concentration photosynthetic performance and amino acid levels upon salt stress . as none of the results revealed significant differences between wt and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants we conclude that _PROTEIN_ mutants are rescued by over _PROTEIN_ of a _LOCATION_ na /h antiporter . chloroplasts from the halophytes m. crystallinum and suaeda maritima accumulate high concentrations of sodium under salt stress conditions . in this study we analyzed whether the glycophytic model plant arabidopsis is able to accumulate sodium to similar high levels in its chloroplasts . when grown in liquid culture wild type _PROTEIN_ and all three _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines developed at almost the same efficiency reaching approximately mg _METHOD_ within days . exogenous mm nacl application led to a _PROTEIN_ of approximately in the fresh weight in wild type controls and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants to mg fresh _METHOD_ . however under the same conditions growth of _PROTEIN_ mutants was even more inhibited compared to wt plants producing mg fresh _METHOD_ . similarly the total chlorophyll content was comparable in all mutant lines and wild type under control conditions but was significantly reduced in the _PROTEIN_ mutant compared to wt after salt treatment . as seen for the fresh weight _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ showed a strongly _PROTEIN_ chlorophyll content of approximately compared to wt plants after salt exposure . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants showed no significant differences in fresh weight and chlorophyll content upon salt treatment compared to wt . when grown in liquid half strength _METHOD_ medium all plants lines had similar _METHOD_ and morphology . the additional presence of mm nacl in the medium after days inhibited growth of all plant lines . however _PROTEIN_ plants exhibited stronger growth retardation compared to wt and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants . _PROTEIN_ individuals hardly developed at all after salt application and contained only minor amounts of chlorophyll . to investigate whether wt and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants are able to accumulate excess sodium within chloroplasts we grew plants on sand supplemented with mm nacl for days under short day conditions prior to analysis of chlorophyll levels total na contents in leaf tissue and _LOCATION_ sodium levels . as described above all three _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines exhibited similar reactions upon salt treatment . therefore we focused these analyses on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ line _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants . application of mm nacl for only days prior to analyses did not have specific effects on total chlorophyll levels in wt and mutants as all plant lines contained approximately mg chl . both wt and mutant plants accumulated up to na after watering with mm nacl which is approximately times more sodium compared to non treated control plants . interestingly the additional presence of nacl in the daily applied water led to a doubled na content in isolated wt and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ chloroplasts . chloroplasts isolated from salt treated _PROTEIN_ knockout mutants accumulated even higher sodium amounts reaching na in _PROTEIN_ and na in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants respectively . this three to fourfold increase represents a significant increase in _LOCATION_ sodium concentration compared to chloroplasts isolated from wt and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants . as indicated by _METHOD_ and venus fusions _PROTEIN_ localizes to the chloroplast envelope . in line with this loss of the protein led to increased _LOCATION_ na concentration upon salt treatment accompanied by a significantly reduced chlorophyll content and paler leaves . therefore we were interested in monitoring the effects of loss of _PROTEIN_ on chloroplast localized photosynthetic reactions . by use of the pulse amplitude modulated _METHOD_ analysis it is possible to quantify both the quantum efficiency of photosystem ii and the degree of non photochemical quenching . is a direct measure of the relative use of light energy for photosynthesis whereas the npq provides insight into the degree of quenching of excess light that can not be used for photosynthesis . in the case of wt and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants the absence or presence of mm nacl for days did not alter . in contrast nacl treatment of _PROTEIN_ knockout plants significantly reduced by up to compared to untreated control plants . similarly the npq of wt and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants was not altered by the presence of mm nacl for days . in contrast _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants showed a significant increase in npq of compared to control conditions . recently _PROTEIN_ activity in the species flaveria bidentis has been shown to be associated with the chloroplastic na driven pyruvate carrier _PROTEIN_ . pyruvate uptake into _LOCATION_ is required to fuel biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids . to investigate whether altered _PROTEIN_ activity is involved in with synthesis of aromatic amino acids we quantified the leaf content of biogenic amino acids in wt plants _PROTEIN_ knockout and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants under control and salt stress conditions . with the exceptions of phenylalanine and tyrosine none of the measured biogenic amino acids showed a different pattern in _PROTEIN_ mutants compared to corresponding wt plants . interestingly when compared to wt and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants the levels of phenylalanine were significantly _PROTEIN_ in all genotypes but only if plants were treated with mm nacl . wt and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants contained nmol g phenylalanine under salt stress whereas _PROTEIN_ knockout mutants contained only between and nmol g . tyrosine levels increased approximately in _PROTEIN_ knockout mutants upon salt stress but there was no alteration in tyrosine levels in wt and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants .
