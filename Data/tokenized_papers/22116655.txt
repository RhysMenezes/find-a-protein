calmodulin is a ubiquitous sensor/transducer of calcium signals in eukaryotic _METHOD_ . while cam mediated calcium regulation of _LOCATION_ processes is well established there is growing evidence for the inclusion of organelles such as chloroplasts mitochondria and _LOCATION_ into the calcium/calmodulin regulation network . a number of cam binding proteins have been identified in these organelles and processes such as protein import into chloroplasts and mitochondria have been shown to be governed by cam regulation . what have been missing to date are the mediators of this regulation since no cam or calmodulin like protein has been identified in any of these organelles . here we show that two arabidopsis cmls _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are localized in _LOCATION_ and mitochondria respectively . _PROTEIN_ is targeted via an unusual c terminal _PROTEIN_ like tripeptide while _PROTEIN_ utilizes an n terminal non cleavable transit peptide . both proteins possess the typical structure of _METHOD_ with two pairs of ef hand motifs separated by a short linker domain . they furthermore display common characteristics such as calcium dependent alteration of gel mobility and calcium dependent exposure of a hydrophobic surface . this indicates that they can function in a similar manner as canonical _METHOD_ . the presence of close homologues to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in other plants further indicates that organellar targeting of these cmls is not a specific feature of arabidopsis . the identification of peroxisomal and mitochondrial cmls is an important step in the understanding how these organelles are integrated into the cellular calcium/calmodulin signaling pathways .
evidence for calcium/calmodulin regulation in chloroplasts mitochondria and _LOCATION_ has been described but so far no cam has been identified in any of these organelles . moreover none of the four _METHOD_ of canonical _METHOD_ encoded in the arabidopsis genome _METHOD_ contains a potential targeting signal into any organelle . nevertheless plants possess so called cmls variations of the ubiquitous calcium sensor cam . these proteins display sequence identity to canonical _METHOD_ but contain alterations with _PROTEIN_ to structural properties as well as n and c terminal extensions . for several of these atcmls a potential targeting sequence is predicted by different _METHOD_ but a clear allocation to a specific organelle can not be obtained . this had been previously observed for a smaller set of these proteins . most peroxisomal proteins are targeted by the peroxisomal targeting signal type _PROTEIN_ a c terminal tripeptide such as skl or variances thereof . a slightly diverged _PROTEIN_ tripeptide is present in _PROTEIN_ making this a good candidate for a peroxisomal cam . with _PROTEIN_ to mitochondria the most promising candidate was _PROTEIN_ . the protein contains an n terminal extension of amino acids when compared to the canonical and a majority of prediction _METHOD_ favour a mitochondrial localization . these proteins were thus chosen for further studies . to analyse the in vivo localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ their full length coding sequences were cloned for agrobacteria mediated transformation of tobacco leaves . the proteins were _PROTEIN_ either as a c terminal _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or n terminal _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion to the coding sequence of _METHOD_ . tobacco leaves were infiltrated with agrobacteria carrying the various constructs . protoplasts were isolated after h from transformed leaves and analysed using laser scanning confocal microscopy . no clear localization could be observed with full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the signal pattern is reminiscent of a _LOCATION_ localization with certain denser regions that align with the signal of mito tracker red which was used to mark the localization of mitochondria in the cell . since in vitro translation experiments had indicated that methionines in position and could potentially function as additional translation starts a second construct _PROTEIN_ was made exchanging these methionines to isoleucine . the _METHOD_ signal of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ could be detected exclusively in a spot like distribution that resembles the pattern found in wild type cell treated with mito tracker . when cells transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were treated with mito tracker a clear overlay of the _METHOD_ and the mito tracker signal could be observed _PROTEIN_ . this indicates that _PROTEIN_ when translated from the first methionine is targeted to mitochondria in vivo . when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a construct lacking the first amino acids of _PROTEIN_ was analysed the protein showed a clear _LOCATION_ distribution supporting that the n terminal part of _PROTEIN_ contains the information for mitochondrial targeting _PROTEIN_ . while these results strongly support a mitochondrial localization of _PROTEIN_ they also suggest that the protein might be dual targeted to mitochondria and the _LOCATION_ by use of alternate translation starts . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ showed a spot like distribution with signals slightly larger in size and less abundant compared to _PROTEIN_ . they resemble the signal obtained from cells transformed with a peroxisomal marker protein . when tobacco cells were co transformed with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and the peroxisomal marker a clear co localisation was observed _PROTEIN_ . this indicates that _PROTEIN_ is indeed targeted into _LOCATION_ in vivo . _PROTEIN_ lacking the c terminal snl motif was found in the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ while the addition of the snl tripeptide to the c terminal end of _METHOD_ could target this protein into the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . these results confirm the function of the snl motif for peroxisomal targeting . the localization of _PROTEIN_ in mitochondria was further assessed by in vitro import experiments . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ analysis of full length _PROTEIN_ translated in the presence of methionine revealed the presence of several radioactive bands of different molecular _METHOD_ . this indicated a potential translation start at different methionines with the most upper band corresponding to the expected size for full length _PROTEIN_ . the sequence of _PROTEIN_ contains three methionines within the n terminal part of the protein in position and . in vitro translation of constructs with methionines changed to isoleucine confirmed that the different radioactive bands observed for _PROTEIN_ indeed originated from translation starts at these methionines . the right size protein only occurs in the presence of and since the in vivo studies using _METHOD_ fusion had already indicated that only the full length protein is targeted into mitochondria a construct lacking methionines and _PROTEIN_ was used for further studies . import experiments into pea leaf mitochondria were performed using the precursor of the alternative oxidase as a control . successful import and cleavage of the transit sequence is evidenced by the appearance of the processed lower molecular weight form maox that is not sensitive to protease treatment . in case of _PROTEIN_ no processed lower molecular weight form could be detected in the import assays . nevertheless a time dependent increase of protease protected translation product was observed for _PROTEIN_ indicating that the protein had successfully entered the organelle . since we could show that the translation product per se is susceptible to proteolytic digestions this shows that _PROTEIN_ can be imported into mitochondria in a time dependent manner without cleavage of a transit peptide . furthermore _PROTEIN_ was imported into mitochondria with disrupted outer _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . under these conditions protease protection only occurs if proteins are translocated across the inner _LOCATION_ . as expected paox was imported since it is localized on the _PROTEIN_ side of the inner _LOCATION_ . import of _PROTEIN_ could also be observed with similar efficiency as paox . this indicated that _PROTEIN_ enters all the way into the _PROTEIN_ of mitochondria even though the transit peptide is not cleaved . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ both posses typical structural properties of _METHOD_ specifically the presence of two calcium binding ef hand pairs connected by a short linker domain . nevertheless they show a higher divergence in sequence compared to _METHOD_ and both contain additional domains since in neither case the targeting signal is removed from the mature protein . to elucidate whether both cmls could function in a canonical cam fashion some typical characteristics were analysed in comparison to bovine brain cam . the latter can be _PROTEIN_ commercially and is widely used as a canonical cam . a typical characteristic of _METHOD_ is an electrophoretic mobility shift on polyacrylamid gels caused by binding of calcium ions . faster migration on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the presence of calcium can clearly be observed for the bovine cam as well as for _PROTEIN_ . the shift is only minor in case of _PROTEIN_ . in contrast the calcium induced slower migration on native _PROTEIN_ at alkaline ph is clearly evident for bovine cam and _PROTEIN_ as well as for _PROTEIN_ . thus both cmls are able to bind calcium in a manner that alters there gel mobility . the same results were obtained when proteins without a his tag were used indicating that the binding of calcium to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ occurs within the protein itself . in case of _METHOD_ the calcium induced conformational change results in the exposure of a central hydrophobic surface which is required for interaction with the target proteins . this property can be analysed by calcium dependent chromatography on hydrophobic _PROTEIN_ such as phenyl sepharose . for this experiment proteins without his tag were used to exclude any interference of the tag . as above the bovine cam was used as a control . when total extracts of e. coli _PROTEIN_ either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ were applied to the column both proteins bound in the presence of calcium . they could be eluted from the _PROTEIN_ when calcium was replaced by egta indicating that a hydrophobic surface is re buried inside the protein upon removal of calcium . again a mobility shift between the calcium bound and calcium free form of the proteins could be observed . these experiments show that despite their sequence divergence and their additional domains both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have properties reminiscent of canonical _METHOD_ . evidence for cam mediated calcium regulation in _LOCATION_ and mitochondria has been described in _METHOD_ other than arabidopsis thaliana . this raises the question to which extent homologues to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ can be found within the plant kingdom . in arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ belongs to a small group of cmls including and which closely branch together in phylogenetic analyses . database searches yielded annotated proteins with strong similarity to _PROTEIN_ in other plants such as soybean wine and castor bean . most of these proteins group closely together with _PROTEIN_ . tblastn searches further revealed _PROTEIN_ like proteins in brassica rapa and arabidopsis lyrata . the latter one is not displayed since it is identical to _PROTEIN_ . both and contain the _PROTEIN_ tripeptide for peroxisomal targeting indicating that this feature is at least common among the cruciferae but neither of the other _PROTEIN_ like proteins contains a _PROTEIN_ motif . homologues of _PROTEIN_ can be found in many other seed plants and they strongly group together in phylogenetic analysis . even more important all _PROTEIN_ like proteins share the n terminal extension that our experiments have shown to be essential for mitochondrial targeting . strong conservation of the n terminal extension could furthermore be related to the _PROTEIN_ that the targeting sequence is not cleaved off after import into mitochondria and might possess an additional function for the protein . all together this indicates that mitochondrial localization of _PROTEIN_ like proteins is common in plants .
