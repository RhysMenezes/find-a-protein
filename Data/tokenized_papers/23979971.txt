plants have evolved a complex array of defensive responses against pathogenic _METHOD_ . recognition of microbes initiates signaling cascades that activate plant defenses . the _LOCATION_ lipid phosphatidic acid produced by phospholipase d _PROTEIN_ has been shown to take part in both abiotic and biotic stress signaling . in this study the involvement of _PROTEIN_ in the interaction between arabidopsis and the barley powdery mildew fungus blumeria graminis f. sp . hordei was investigated . this nonadapted pathogen is normally resisted by a cell wall based defense which stops the fungal hyphae from penetrating the epidermal cell wall . chemical inhibition of phosphatidic acid production by _PROTEIN_ increased the penetration rate of bgh spores on wild type leaves . the analysis of transfer dna knockout lines for all arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ genes revealed that _PROTEIN_ is involved in penetration resistance against bgh and chemical inhibition of _PROTEIN_ in plants mutated in _PROTEIN_ indicated that this isoform alone is involved in bgh resistance . in addition we confirmed the involvement of _PROTEIN_ in penetration resistance against another nonadapted pea powdery mildew fungus _LOCATION_ pisi . a green _METHOD_ protein fusion of _PROTEIN_ localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ at the bgh attack site where it surrounded the cell wall reinforcement . furthermore in the mutant transcriptional up regulation of early microbe associated molecular pattern response genes was delayed after chitin stimulation . in conclusion we propose that _PROTEIN_ is involved in defense signaling in nonhost resistance against powdery mildew fungi and put _PROTEIN_ forward as the _PROTEIN_ isoform participating in this process .
the development of bgh spores on arabidopsis leaves is synchronous and penetration attempts occur in a narrow time frame around h post inoculation . it is thus possible to score and compare fungal penetration on different plants at a certain time point . to test a possible contribution of _PROTEIN_ generated _PROTEIN_ to plant resistance against bgh penetration we exploited the transphosphatidylation activity of _PROTEIN_ which uses primary alcohols as substrates to form an artificial phosphatidyl alcohol . the preferential formation of this compound impairs _PROTEIN_ production . thus we employed n butanol to inhibit _PROTEIN_ formation by _PROTEIN_ . leaves were infiltrated with different n or _PROTEIN_ butanol concentrations h before inoculation and penetration was scored at d post inoculation . increasing n butanol concentrations caused progressively higher bgh penetration rates from for a water control to for leaves treated with n butanol . in contrast the penetration rate for leaves infiltrated with _PROTEIN_ butanol an alcohol with no inhibitory effects on _PROTEIN_ formation was not significantly different compared with that of the water control . these results thus indicate the involvement of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in cell wall based defense against bgh . we next attempted to measure _PROTEIN_ activity and _PROTEIN_ accumulation during the defense response . to this end leaf explants were labeled with overnight before inoculation with bgh spores . however no increase in _PROTEIN_ label could be measured at and hpi . we set out to identify which if any of the known arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ contributes to penetration resistance against bgh . for this purpose we identified at least one transfer dna insertion line for each _PROTEIN_ gene . the insertion site of each t dna line was verified by sequencing . homozygous plants for t dna insertion lines not previously published were tested by reverse transcription pcr for the presence of the corresponding _PROTEIN_ transcript using primers flanking the insertion site . absence of transcripts confirmed that the t dna lines indeed are knockout mutants of the _PROTEIN_ genes . absence of transcript and/or protein in the and mutants was described in previous publications . the different _PROTEIN_ single ko lines and two _PROTEIN_ double ko lines were scored for bgh penetration resistance by counting interaction events in leaves stained by trypan blue d after inoculation with bgh spores . among all only the _PROTEIN_ ko line displayed a significantly higher bgh penetration rate compared with the wild type . the penetration rate in this mutant was approximately doubled compared with the wild type representing an increase from penetration in the wild type to over in . none of the pld mutants investigated was affected in the cell death response to successfully penetrating spores . furthermore none of the lines displayed any visible growth or other phenotype under our cultivation regime . absence of the _PROTEIN_ specific transcript in was verified with a primer pair annealing downstream of the insertion site in addition to the t dna flanking pair . to confirm that the penetration phenotype of is caused by the specific loss of the _PROTEIN_ protein the mutant was complemented with _PROTEIN_ coding sequence fused to _METHOD_ under the transcriptional regulation of a kb _PROTEIN_ promoter region . this restored wild type levels of bgh penetration . in addition plants were transformed with a mutated version of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene which carried a point mutation turning a his into an asp residue in one of the catalytically active hkd sites of _PROTEIN_ . this his to asp mutation was previously shown to abolish the enzymatic activity of a _PROTEIN_ isoform in cabbage . transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct displayed bgh penetration levels similar to the untransformed further supporting that _PROTEIN_ activity is essential for normal penetration resistance . to verify that _PROTEIN_ is the only _PROTEIN_ isoform that plays a role in penetration resistance against bgh the mutant was treated with n butanol before inoculation with bgh . this treatment caused no further increase in bgh penetration rate . the transcripts of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are the most abundant among the _PROTEIN_ genes in green tissues while _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are the two _METHOD_ most closely related to _PROTEIN_ . bgh penetration was scored in double and triple mutants but none of these displayed higher levels than the single mutant . this together with the n butanol treatment of verified that _PROTEIN_ is the sole _PROTEIN_ isoform involved in penetration resistance . double mutants combining the mutation with the _PROTEIN_ or the _PROTEIN_ mutation did not display higher bgh penetration frequencies than the respective parent pen mutants . to investigate the conservation of the involvement of _PROTEIN_ in penetration resistance against powdery mildew fungi we used the arabidopsis nonhost fungal pathogen _LOCATION_ pisi which is an _PROTEIN_ powdery mildew fungus on pea plants . the ep penetration rate on wild type arabidopsis leaves was higher than that of bgh suggesting a higher level of _PROTEIN_ to arabidopsis . the mutant displayed a significantly higher penetration rate compared with the wild type for ep . the penetration success rate increased from of the germinated spores on wild type leaves to on the mutant . this clearly demonstrates that the _PROTEIN_ gene is involved in penetration resistance against this fungus as well . since ko of the _PROTEIN_ gene caused _PROTEIN_ penetration resistance against two different nonhost powdery mildew fungi and since the gene appears not specifically linked to either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ defined penetration resistance pathways we hypothesized that the activity of the _PROTEIN_ isoform might have a more general role in plant pathogen defense . in particular it _METHOD_ reasonable to suggest that the gene might be involved in signaling after recognition of mamps . it would be interesting to test the response of the mutant to mamps such as chitin since a chitin receptor mutant has been previously found to have reduced powdery mildew resistance . for this purpose wild type and mutant seedlings were treated with a chitin extract and transcriptional changes of the early mamp induced genes _PROTEIN_ receptor like _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and phosphate _PROTEIN_ were evaluated by quantitative rt pcr . the transcript levels of all three genes rapidly increased following treatment with chitin in both wild type and mutant plants . and _PROTEIN_ both reached a peak of transcript accumulation min after treatment whereas _PROTEIN_ transcript increased throughout the experiment . however the mutant showed a trend for an approximately reduction in transcript accumulation after min for and _PROTEIN_ . for all three genes a trend for a delayed chitin induced accumulation of transcripts was observed . observations for _PROTEIN_ were consistent for all biological replicates . results for phi and _PROTEIN_ demonstrated more variability between experiments and in some instances revealed a lower amount of transcript at the zero time point in the mutant . these observations suggest that _PROTEIN_ is needed for rapid and timely activation of _PROTEIN_ controlled defense signaling cascades . the complementation of phenotype by the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene indicates that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ translational fusion is functional . although the _METHOD_ signals of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines were clearly visible in leaves observed with an _METHOD_ microscope they were not sufficiently high for confocal imaging . thus we placed the coding sequence for the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion under the transcriptional regulation of the promoter and transformed this transgene into wild type plants . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line proved to be suitable for confocal microscopy and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ clearly localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of leaf epidermal cells . twenty four hours after bgh inoculation _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was visible in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in general and at the regions of fungal attack where the appressoria attempted penetration . here _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ labeled the rim of the forming papilla . z stack observations and three dimensional visualization of several fungal attack sites displayed an accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ which _METHOD_ a cup like shape around the papilla . occasionally the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ around bgh interaction sites extended to the surrounding _LOCATION_ in the shape of a compact disk . three dimensional reconstruction of these entry sites showed a small _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ invagination corresponding to a small papilla . nontransformed wild type leaf epidermal cells exhibited low _METHOD_ in the _METHOD_ channel before and h after inoculation with bgh spores . the _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ associated with stomatal guard cell walls and did not coincide with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal .
