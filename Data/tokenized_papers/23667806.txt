protein protein interactions are critical for most cellular processes however many remain to be identified . here to comprehensively identify protein complexes in photosynthetic _METHOD_ we applied the recently developed approach of blue native _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ coupled with lc _METHOD_ to the _LOCATION_ proteins of arabidopsis thaliana and the whole cell proteins of whole cell proteins of synechocystis sp . pcc . we identified proteins from the purified arabidopsis _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and proteins from the whole cells of synechocystis using the method . next we generated protein migration profiles that were assessed by plotting the label free estimations of protein abundances versus migration distance in bn _PROTEIN_ . comparisons between the migration profiles of the major photosynthetic complexes and their band patterns showed that the protein migration profiles were well correlated . thus the protein migration profiles allowed us to estimate the molecular size of each protein complex and to identify co migrated proteins with the proteins of interest by determining the protein pairs that contained peaks in the same gel slice . finally we built the protein co migration database for photosynthetic _METHOD_ to make our data publicly accessible online which stores the analyzed data with a user friendly interface to compare the migration profiles of proteins of interest . it helps users to find unidentified protein complexes in arabidopsis _LOCATION_ and synechocystis cells . the accumulation of the data from the bn _PROTEIN_ coupled with lc _METHOD_ should reveal unidentified protein complexes and should aid in understanding the _PROTEIN_ and the evolution of photosynthetic _METHOD_ . the online version of this article contains supplementary material which is available to authorized users .
we purified the arabidopsis _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ using sucrose density gradients . the _LOCATION_ were then solubilized with dodecyl maltoside and separated by bn _PROTEIN_ . the band pattern of the separated _LOCATION_ protein complexes in the cbb staining gel was essentially the same as the profile of wt identified in our previous report . based on the identifications in that report the bands of the four psii lhcii supercomplexes the dimeric psii and the psi lhci supercomplex the psii monomer the lhcii assembly _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the trimeric lhcii visualized by cbb staining were identified .figure of the protein complexes in wild type _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _LOCATION_ proteins were separated by bn _PROTEIN_ . the bn _PROTEIN_ gel was cut horizontally into pieces at approximately intervals followed by protein identification using lc _METHOD_ . the identification of the pigment protein complexes psi lhci supercomplex psii dimer psi lhci psii monomer _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lhcii trimer and lhcii trimer was performed according to previous reports . the gel slices that corresponded to the pigment protein complexes are indicated . separation of the protein complexes in wild type _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _LOCATION_ proteins were separated by bn _PROTEIN_ . the bn _PROTEIN_ gel was cut horizontally into pieces at approximately intervals followed by protein identification using lc _METHOD_ . the identification of the pigment protein complexes psi lhci supercomplex psii dimer psi lhci psii monomer _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lhcii trimer and lhcii trimer was performed according to previous reports . the gel slices that corresponded to the pigment protein complexes are indicated . to identify the _LOCATION_ proteins separated by bn _PROTEIN_ we sliced a bn gel lane horizontally into pieces from the top of the gel to immediately before the dye front . these gel slices were processed for in gel digestion with trypsin and analyzed by lc _METHOD_ . in total proteins were identified from the gel slices . the purified _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ may have been contaminated by other cellular fractions . to estimate the number of _LOCATION_ localized proteins among all the identified proteins we compared our results with the recent large scale _LOCATION_ proteomic study by ferro et al . _PROTEIN_ . according to their results of the proteins were classified as _LOCATION_ proteins and proteins were classified as envelope or stromal proteins . in addition we identified known _LOCATION_ localized proteins that were not classified as _LOCATION_ proteins by ferro et al . _PROTEIN_ including ndh proteins proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . therefore a minimum of of the proteins were likely _LOCATION_ localized proteins whereas the functions of the remaining proteins were largely unknown . to verify the enrichment of the _LOCATION_ proteins in our protein sample we estimated the abundances of the identified proteins in the protein samples using the empai method . the empai method which is based on the numbers of observed peptides per protein by lc _METHOD_ and is further normalized by the observable number of peptides has been used for label free semi quantitative estimates of relative protein abundances and has been reported to exhibit a good correlation with protein abundance in samples . according to the paper we calculated the protein content in molar percentages using the empai values and found that the putative _LOCATION_ proteins in our results accounted for of all the identified proteins suggesting that the _LOCATION_ proteins were substantially enriched in the sample . the protein migration profiles which were assessed by the label free estimation of protein abundances versus the migration distance in bn _PROTEIN_ were reported to be substantially similar among subunits in the same protein complexes . label free quantitative approaches are inexpensive and have a considerable analytical depth and dynamic range although quantitative precision is typically lower compared to stable isotope approaches . in this study we generated the empai based protein migration profiles across all the bn gel slices in which each empai value was plotted on the y axis and each gel slice number was plotted on the x axis based on the mascot data from each gel slice . before using the empai based protein migration profiles for identifying protein complexes we first verified the correlation between the empai based protein migration profiles and their band patterns by comparing the empai based migration profiles of the psii proteins with their band patterns which were visualized by the cbb staining on the bn _PROTEIN_ . the bands of the psii lhcii supercomplexes the psii dimer and the psii monomer were visualized by the cbb staining in the region on the bn _PROTEIN_ gel lane corresponding to the slices between and slices and and slice respectively . meanwhile the empai based migration profiles of four psii core subunits _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ had peaks that corresponded to the bands of the psii complexes from the bn _PROTEIN_ . the empai based migration profiles of the remaining psii core proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were also similar . likewise the empai based migration profiles of lhcii proteins had peaks that corresponded to the psii lhcii supercomplex the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lhcii supercomplex and the lhcii trimer in the bn _PROTEIN_ respectively . the empai values in the peaks of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were much smaller than those of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ likely because their hydrophobicity . the likelihood of the _METHOD_ based protein detection varied greatly depending on the properties of each peptide such as the peptide length net charge and solubility . especially the probability of identifying very hydrophobic proteins is typically low.figure migration profiles of the psii lhcii psi and lhci proteins . the empai based protein migration profiles of the psii core subunits _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lhcii proteins _PROTEIN_ four psi core subunits _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and lhci proteins _PROTEIN_ are shown . the empai value of psad was the sum of the empai values of and . the pigment protein complexes corresponding to the peaks in the migration profiles of the psi ndh supercomplex

lhci proteins . the empai based protein migration profiles of the psii core subunits _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lhcii proteins _PROTEIN_ four psi core subunits _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and lhci proteins _PROTEIN_ are shown . the empai value of psad was the sum of the empai values of and . the pigment protein complexes corresponding to the peaks in the migration profiles of the psi ndh supercomplex psii lhcii supercomplex psi lhci supercomplex psii dimer psi lhci psii monomer _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lhcii trimer and lhcii trimer are indicated . in addition to psii the psi lhci supercomplex and the psi monomer were visualized in bn _PROTEIN_ by the cbb staining and the empai based migration profiles of four psi core proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ had peaks that corresponded to the cbb stained bands of the psi lhci supercomplex and the psi monomer . the empai values of _PROTEIN_ were much smaller than those of _PROTEIN_ and psad likely because their hydrophobicity . all of the remaining psi proteins except for _PROTEIN_ exhibited similar empai based migration profiles . the empai based migration profiles of the lhci proteins also contained major peaks corresponding to the psi lhci supercomplex . although the large _LOCATION_ protein complexes cytochrome complex _PROTEIN_ synthase and the ndh complex were not clearly visualized in the bn gel we previously reported their oligomeric states in the bn gel using bn/sds _PROTEIN_ . consequently we further verified whether the empai based migration profiles of the subunits in the large _LOCATION_ protein complexes were consistent with their respective oligomeric states . the empai based migration profiles of the four proteins of cytochrome complex _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ contained a peak that likely corresponded to the dimeric form of the complex at gel slice and the empai based migration profiles of the chloroplastic _PROTEIN_ synthase proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ had a peak that corresponded to the complex at gel slice and some of them _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ also had a peak that corresponded to the _PROTEIN_ subunit at gel slice .figure migration profiles of four representative subunits from the _PROTEIN_ synthase and ndh proteins . the empai based protein migration profiles of the cytochrome proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ synthase proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and ndh proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are shown . the protein complexes corresponding to the peaks in the migration profiles of the cytochrome dimer synthase _PROTEIN_ subcomplex psi ndh supercomplex and ndh monomer were estimated based on the oligomeric states of the protein complexes . for the ndh proteins we followed the nomenclature proposed by ifuku et al . . protein migration profiles of four representative subunits from the _PROTEIN_ synthase and ndh proteins . the empai based protein migration profiles of the cytochrome proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ synthase proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and ndh proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are shown . the protein complexes corresponding to the peaks in the migration profiles of the cytochrome dimer synthase _PROTEIN_ subcomplex psi ndh supercomplex and ndh monomer were estimated based on the oligomeric states of the protein complexes . for the ndh proteins we followed the nomenclature proposed by ifuku et al . . in addition to the major protein complexes of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ ndh proteins were identified in this study . the nomenclature of ndh proteins were followed by ifuku et al . . the major form of the ndh complex in arabidopsis is the psi lhci supercomplex which consists of the psi lhci and the monomeric ndh with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins acting as linker proteins . the empai based migration profiles of all the identified ndh subunits except _PROTEIN_ contained a peak in slice that corresponded to the psi ndh supercomplex . many of the psi and lhci proteins were also identified in slice . in addition _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins were also identified in the slices between and likely corresponding to the monomeric ndh complex . these results demonstrated that the subunits from the same protein complex generally exhibited similar empai based migration profiles . in addition the empai based protein migration profiles can be used to reveal the oligomeric states of the photosynthetic protein complexes and used to find the co migrated proteins with a protein of interest . however it should be noted that some of the psi and psii subunits were not identified in this study . since the probability of identifying a small protein and a very insoluble protein were typically low the small subunits of the psi and the psii may be difficult to identify by lc _METHOD_ . future technical developments should be required to comprehensive identify protein complexes . using arabidopsis _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as a model our data presented here showed that bn _PROTEIN_ coupled with lc _METHOD_ was useful for identifying potential protein complexes . one of the goals of our research is the comprehensive identification of protein complexes in the whole cells of photosynthetic _METHOD_ to aid in understanding their cellular processes . therefore we applied the described method to the whole cell proteins of the cyanobacterium synechocystis sp . pcc . the whole cells of synechocystis sp . pcc were homogenized using glass beads on a vortex mixer . dnase treatment was performed to remove the genomic dna that was reported to significantly interfere with bn _PROTEIN_ using the whole cells of bacteria . the protein complexes were mildly solubilized with dodecyl maltoside and then separated by bn _PROTEIN_ . the bn gel lanes were cut horizontally from the top of the gel to just before the dye front and the gel slices were then processed by in gel digestion with trypsin and analyzed by lc _METHOD_ . as a result we identified synechocystis proteins which were accounting for of the total number of all the predicted gene models . according to the functional category by cyanobase identified proteins were distributed all over functional categories . notably proteins were classified into hypothetical or unknown .figure application of the bn _PROTEIN_ method coupled with lc _METHOD_ tosynechocystis cells . separation of the protein complexes from

_PROTEIN_ . protein bands were visualized by cbb staining . protein migration profiles of psii core subunits in synechocystis . putative peaks corresponding to the psii dimer psii monomer and less psii were shown . we then generated the empai based migration profiles for identified proteins based on the mascot data from each gel . for examples the peaks in their migration profiles corresponding to the putative psii dimer the psii monomer and the less psii were well correlated with the oligomeric states of psii in synechocystis according to the previous paper . these data shows that the bn _PROTEIN_ coupled with lc _METHOD_ was useful even when whole cells were used . because empai based migration profiles provide us useful information _PROTEIN_ protein complexes we built a web application called pcom db that shows and compares the migration profiles of the identified proteins in this study .figure and search interfaces in pcom db and comparing the migration profiles ofsynechocystispsac and psad proteins using pcom db . users can easily find the protein migration profile of a protein of interest through browse and search interfaces . then users also can find the potential interacting partners by finding the proteins which shared the peaks in the protein migration profiles using pcom db . in addition users can compare the overall protein migration profiles of potential interacting partners with a protein of interest . in this case protein migration profiles of _PROTEIN_ and psad were shown as an example . the migration profiles of a synechocystis _PROTEIN_ protein had a peak in the gel slice corresponding to the psi trimer . only clicking the blue closed circle showing the _PROTEIN_ empai value at the gel slice users can find the proteins which were also detected in the gel slice as potential interacting partners . browse and search interfaces in pcom db and comparing the migration profiles ofsynechocystispsac and psad proteins using pcom db .
