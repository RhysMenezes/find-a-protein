three new _LOCATION_ genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of arabidopsis thaliana encoding putative _LOCATION_ rna polymerase _PROTEIN_ were identified and analyzed . phylogenetic analysis revealed that higher plant _PROTEIN_ fell into at least four distinct subgroups within a diverse protein family . in addition arabidopsis sig genes contained conserved chromosomal intron sites indicating that these genes arose by dna duplication events during plant evolution . transcript analyses revealed two alternatively spliced transcripts generated from the _PROTEIN_ region one of which is predicted to encode a protein lacking the _PROTEIN_ terminal regions and . finally the amino terminal sequence of the _PROTEIN_ gene product was shown to function as a _LOCATION_ targeting signal using green _METHOD_ protein fusions .
we have searched the data available from the arabidopsis genome project and found three new _PROTEIN_ genes . by a blast search a genomic dna region was obtained on a chromosome v clone _METHOD_ which showed similarity to _PROTEIN_ cdna . by a search on the kazusa arabidopsis data base accession site an annotated open reading frame was found on a chr v clone which was homologous to _PROTEIN_ of the cyanobacterium synechococcus sp . . by a keyword search for genbank sequences another potential gene was found within a chr ii bac . for the respective sequences we predicted orfs and intron by dna sequence alignment and splice site prediction . the isolated cdnas for each gene encode polypeptides homologous to the e. coli type rna polymerase _PROTEIN_ and contain the conserved regions which are required for binding to the core rna polymerase and recognition of the dna promoter elements . we designated them _PROTEIN_ for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ for and _PROTEIN_ for respectively . we noted that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are identical to the genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may be identical to the partial sequence _PROTEIN_ all genes of which were independently registered by other groups . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes were estimated to encode polypeptides of and amino acids corresponding to molecular sizes of and kda respectively . approximate locations of a. thaliana sig genes on chromosomes are shown in . since _PROTEIN_ has two potential initiator methionine codons for the amino terminus of its orf there are two possibilities for its calculated molecular weight . interestingly we also isolated two cdna species of _PROTEIN_ both of which would _PROTEIN_ a polypeptide translationally interrupted within region _PROTEIN_ . to understand the relationship among plant _PROTEIN_ representative eubacterial group and group _PROTEIN_ and known _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ were analyzed phylogenetically . the results showed that higher plant _PROTEIN_ formed a monophyletic group . however probably because of lower conservation branches of _LOCATION_ and cyanobacterial group _PROTEIN_ were not clearly separated . interestingly many of the higher plant _PROTEIN_ fell into four subgroups each including either arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . in addition at least _PROTEIN_ subgroup members were further divided into monocot and dicot groups . higher plant _PROTEIN_ appear to be classified into structurally conserved groups beyond plant species . in a comparison of the intron sites of arabidopsis _LOCATION_ sig genes all three in _PROTEIN_ and four out of eight in _PROTEIN_ turned out to be identical to the corresponding intron sites of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . especially intron sites of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ corresponding to the conserved regions through are completely identical . in contrast none of the _PROTEIN_ intron sites appears to correspond to those in any of the other genes . these observations indicate that gene duplication events from one or a few origins and sequential insertion of intron may have led to multiple sig genes during plant evolution and that higher plant _PROTEIN_ may share a common origin . northern blot analyses were performed to detect transcripts of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ using total rna of day old seedlings grown under continuous illumination . only one weak signal was observed for every sig gene . the estimated transcript sizes were kb for _PROTEIN_ kb for _PROTEIN_ and kb for _PROTEIN_ and roughly corresponded to the isolated cdna lengths . transcript levels for _PROTEIN_ were the lowest among the three genes whereas transcript levels for _PROTEIN_ were highest . we have isolated another _PROTEIN_ cdna species that contains a base upstream shift of the intron splice donor site . since this alternative cdna species was frequently isolated from the library we concluded that this transcript was generated by an alternative splicing mechanism . no other splicing pattern was found by rt pcr analyses . the transcript encoded a kda polypeptide lacking the _PROTEIN_ terminal region of the full length _PROTEIN_ product _PROTEIN_ by a translational frameshifting . the kda polypeptide _PROTEIN_ contains only extended residues l v v c r e a c g s from the frameshifting site within region . subsequently we investigated plant organ specificity of _PROTEIN_ of the two alternatively spliced transcripts by rt pcr using specific primer sets for each and both were detected in cotyledons _METHOD_ cauline leaves and rosette leaves . however relative amounts of the two transcripts appeared to differ in each organ . although the amino terminal regions of _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ revealed limited conservation they are relatively rich in serine and threonine residues . _LOCATION_ encoded _LOCATION_ protein precursors generally contain serine and threonine rich amino terminal extensions that function as _LOCATION_ targeting signals . therefore we fused _METHOD_ with the amino terminal region of _PROTEIN_ and co introduced the corresponding constructs into tobacco leaf cells by the particle bombardment method . the fused _METHOD_ gene which was controlled under the promoter was _PROTEIN_ transiently and localized in chloroplasts while non fused _METHOD_ was observed in the cytoplasm and the _LOCATION_ . thus the amino terminus of _PROTEIN_ was shown to function as a _LOCATION_ targeting signal . we could not confirm properties of the amino terminal sequences of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ by similar experiments .
