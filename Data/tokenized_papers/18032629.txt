the arabidopsis thaliana male _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ gene is critical for viable pollen formation and has homology to the phd finger class of transcription _PROTEIN_ however its role in pollen development has not been fully defined . we show that _METHOD_ transcription appears to be autoregulated by the wild type _METHOD_ transcript or protein . using a functional green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion to analyze the temporal and spatial _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ we demonstrate that the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ protein is _LOCATION_ localized within the tapetum and is _PROTEIN_ in a developmentally regulated manner between _PROTEIN_ tetraspore and microspore release then rapidly breaks down probably by ubiquitin dependent proteolysis . absence of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ results in changes in tapetal secretion and exine structure . microarray analysis has shown that genes have altered _PROTEIN_ in young _METHOD_ buds . these genes are primarily associated with pollen wall and coat formation however a number of transcription _PROTEIN_ and cys proteases have also been identified as the putative primary regulatory targets of _METHOD_ . ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ alters transcriptional regulation of vegetative gene _PROTEIN_ resulting in stunted plants with increased levels of branching partially fertile flowers and an apparent increase in wall material on mature pollen . _METHOD_ therefore plays a critical role in the induction of pollen wall and pollen coat materials in the tapetum and ultimately the production of viable pollen .
quantitative rt pcr analysis of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was conducted using pools of developmentally staged closed buds consisting of pmcs through to meiosis stage tetrads through to pollen mitosis i and mitosis ii through to dehiscence . in the wild type _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is maximal from pmcs through to meiosis . low levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are also detected in young buds and old buds indicating that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is from meiosis through to mitosis i stage . this agrees with previous promoter _PROTEIN_ reporter data but is slightly longer than was shown by in situ hybridization and this may be a reflection of the sensitivity of the detection methods . _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ mutant transcript was also analyzed this mutant has a point mutation at the junction of the second intron and therefore fails to splice normally . the mutation results in a truncated transcript that is predicted to produce a nonfunctional protein of amino acids which is missing the leu zipper and phd domains of the full length _METHOD_ protein . _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ mutant transcript is at a significantly higher level and for a longer duration than the wild type _METHOD_ transcript . extremely high levels of _PROTEIN_ are seen in both pmc to meiosis and tetrad to mitosis i stages in _METHOD_ compared with the wild type . during mitosis i a reduction in _PROTEIN_ is seen in the wild type however this does not occur in the _METHOD_ mutant further increasing the difference in _PROTEIN_ at this stage . in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is also _PROTEIN_ during mitosis ii stage albeit at a slightly lower level than in the young mutant buds however this is still fold increased compared with the wild type . rt pcr was also conducted on our other _METHOD_ alleles all of these mutants result from single base mutations that are predicted to form partial transcripts and lose the phd finger motif . increased _PROTEIN_ of the mutant transcripts is seen in all of the _METHOD_ alleles compared with the wild type buds however this increase is greatest in the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ alleles which show a failure of splicing of the second intron . however equal _PROTEIN_ of the wild type and mutant transcript is seen in the landsberg _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ heterozygote indicating that wild type _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is not affected by the _METHOD_ mutant transcript or mutant protein and that a single copy of the full length wild type _METHOD_ transcript can downregulate both its own _PROTEIN_ and that of the mutant transcript . _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ was localized using translational _METHOD_ fusions under the control of the native _METHOD_ promoter which were transformed into heterozygous _METHOD_ ttg plants and the subsequent generations screened to identify homozygous _METHOD_ complemented lines . both the n and the c terminal _METHOD_ _METHOD_ fusions rescued the male sterile phenotype of the _METHOD_ ttg lines to full fertility however the internal _METHOD_ construct in which the _METHOD_ tag was inserted upstream of the lz motif was not functional . rt pcr analysis of the complemented lines showed the presence of the _METHOD_ mutant transcript and the _METHOD_ and nptii transgene . stronger _METHOD_ signal was seen in the lines carrying the c terminal construct compared with the n terminal construct and these were used for the subsequent _PROTEIN_ analysis . hybridization of _METHOD_ polyclonal antibodies to total protein isolated from _METHOD_ _METHOD_ c terminal fusion lines showed a kd band _METHOD_ _METHOD_ corresponding to the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ fusion protein in buds as well as from excised anthers in the transgenic lines which was absent from the wild type buds . _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ fusion protein is only detected in the tapetal tissues of the anther and no signal is seen in the microspores or in the vegetative tissues . _PROTEIN_ starts in the tapetum as the callose wall separating the tetraspores begins to degrade no _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ is detected before this stage . the timing of callose breakdown is developmentally regulated and is critical for pollen viability and occurs sequentially across the anther locules a similar progression of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is observed . once the entire callose wall has broken down and the microspores are released maximal _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is seen within the tapetum across the whole locule . immediately after microspore release pollen wall development and microspore mitosis occur and the tapetum is clearly discernable at this stage but the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ fusion protein is no longer detected . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ fusion protein is therefore only detectable for a short developmental period of h from _PROTEIN_ tetraspore until the free microspore stage . this is similar to the _METHOD_ rna _PROTEIN_ pattern with translation occurring soon after detection of the transcript however the _METHOD_ transcript can be detected for an extended period beyond this suggesting a process of developmentally regulated breakdown . however if anthers are excised from the plant and _PROTEIN_ at in a humid environment the developmental process is halted and the microspores fail to go through mitosis i . under these conditions the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ fusion protein persists and does not go through normal breakdown . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signal is detected for at least d after which point the anthers undergo general degeneration and analysis was discontinued . the deduced _METHOD_ protein sequence contains a predicted n terminal _LOCATION_ localizing sequence pkkr and previous transient _PROTEIN_ studies using the truncated n terminal region of the _METHOD_ polypeptide suggested that the _METHOD_ protein might be _LOCATION_ localized . the functional _METHOD_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was detected within the _LOCATION_ of the tapetal cells no cytoplasmic _PROTEIN_ was seen thus confirming that the predicted _LOCATION_ localizing sequence is effective for _LOCATION_ targeting of the _METHOD_ protein within the tapetum . transcript profiling of the _METHOD_ ttg mutant was performed on closed buds that had been staged by microscopy and rt pcr into two developmental groups young from formation of the sporogeneous tissues to pollen mitosis i old pollen mitosis ii through to dehiscence . statistical analysis of microarrays was used to analyze the data a false discovery cutoff of was used for the initial selection of candidate genes and a secondary filtering of > _PROTEIN_ fold difference was then applied . comparisons between the two developmental stages showed that in the wild type more genes are upregulated in the young buds compared with the _PROTEIN_ stages of mitosis ii through to dehiscence this agrees with previous reports in the literature of the pollen transcriptome . these changes in gene _PROTEIN_ correlate with the stages of cell differentiation and biosynthesis that occur during the early stages of pollen maturation . in the _METHOD_ mutant a general reduction in gene _PROTEIN_ was seen . the _METHOD_ gene is functional at mid stages of development therefore changes in gene _PROTEIN_ were expected during the _PROTEIN_ stages of development after _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ however no significant _METHOD_ associated _PROTEIN_ changes were detected in this older material . however genes _PROTEIN_ showed differential _PROTEIN_ during the early stages of development in the _METHOD_ mutant compared with the wild type buds however when filtered for changes of > _PROTEIN_ fold the number of genes reduced to and of these only were identified as _PROTEIN_ in the anther . of the genes were found to be also _PROTEIN_ in the pollen while were _PROTEIN_ in the anther but not found within the pollen transcriptome set . comparisons were also made to array data sets for the spl and _METHOD_ mutants and and genes were seen to change in the spl and _METHOD_ mutants respectively . the differences in numbers of genes changing reflect the relative position of the mutants in the network of pollen development with _PROTEIN_ active very early followed by _METHOD_ and then at a _PROTEIN_ stage of development _METHOD_ . the genes that change in all three mutants reflect genes that are downstream of _METHOD_ as either direct or indirect targets . the other remaining are likely to act in parts of the pollen development pathway that are independent of _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ . among the genes that are very highly upregulated in the young _METHOD_ tissue and are _PROTEIN_ in the anther tissues are _GENE_ two unknown proteins and _GENE_ . the downregulated genes showing the greatest changes in _METHOD_ young buds are genes associated with pollen wall development including _GENE_ _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ . _PROTEIN_ data obtained from the array hybridization were verified by rt pcr using a group of key genes selected because they had high fold change and/or functional relevance that included anther specific genes transcription _PROTEIN_ pollen wall lignin biosynthesis and high fold changes in genes related to the cytochrome and hypothetical proteins with no homology with any other arabidopsis protein . all data confirmed the _PROTEIN_ changes seen in the arrays . the _METHOD_ gene is not represented on the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ however the _PROTEIN_ of other genes known to be associated with pollen development including _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ were also analyzed by rt pcr to verify the microarray _PROTEIN_ data . early genes associated with anther development meiosis and tapetal initiation _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ which is associated with wax biosynthesis do not show significant changes in _PROTEIN_ in the _METHOD_ mutant . however _PROTEIN_ which has homology to lipid transfer proteins and is _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ during pollen wall development showed significant downregulation . _METHOD_ which has homology to a fatty acyl reductase involved in pollen wall formation showed a slightly prolonged _PROTEIN_ in older _METHOD_ buds however sam analysis did not show this as significant and since this occurs after most of the _METHOD_ related changes it _METHOD_ unlikely that there is a direct link between the regulation of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . microarray data from the _METHOD_ mutant which has impaired tapetal development and is active at an earlier stage than _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ indicated a number of genes in the pollen development pathway . many of these genes do not show altered _PROTEIN_ in the _METHOD_ mutant although the genes encoding for a lipid transfer protein a hexose transport protein polyadenylated binding protein and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ show changed _PROTEIN_ in the _METHOD_ mutant and therefore can be placed downstream of _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ in the _METHOD_ mutant of genes previously reported as altered in _PROTEIN_ by _METHOD_ and involved in pollen development the downregulated genes showing differential _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ fall into a number of functional groups a large number of them are associated with catalytic activities principally of hydrolase activity which are associated with cell wall biosynthesis and lipid associated genes involved in the production of pollen wall materials . cluster analysis of gene _PROTEIN_ identified a number of groups that showed coordinated _PROTEIN_ profiles in _METHOD_ for example the tapetal oleosin and apg like genes . the oleosin genes comprise a family of members many of which are associated with seed oil body formation but some have been linked to pollen wall development . seed related oleosin genes do not show alterations in _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ indicating the specificity of the _METHOD_ regulated pathway . a number of transcription _PROTEIN_ show downregulated _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ and four of these show clustering of _PROTEIN_ suggesting coordinate regulation indicating that they are likely direct targets for _METHOD_ . another group of genes that are overrepresented in the data set are cys proteases . these show varying levels of downregulation ranging from to fold . the pollen wall can be divided into two distinct regions the inner intine and outer exine . in the _METHOD_ mutant exine formation is abnormal with initial deposition of prime exine occurring but with only limited sporopollenin deposition . we conducted further ultrastructural analysis on wild type ler and _METHOD_ buds to determine the effect of _METHOD_ on tapetal development and specifically secretion of pollen wall material . once the microspores are released from the callose wall the tapetal cells start to appear abnormal and secretion into the locule is affected . after the first mitotic division the wild type tapetal cells contain a large number of inclusions lipid deposits in the _LOCATION_ become larger than in previous stages and cytoplasmic lipid droplets fuse to form large drops . high numbers of vesicles containing fibrillar material are present in the cytoplasm . in the wild type vesicles can be seen to migrate to the inner tapetal _LOCATION_ which _PROTEIN_ breaks down to aid release of the pollen wall material . whereas in _METHOD_ the materials accumulate in the tapetum these small vesicles form an extensive network of vesicles that progressively fuse and effectively engulf the entirety of the tapetum cells coalescing to form large _LOCATION_ . surprisingly these vesicles do not seem to fuse with the cell _LOCATION_ but with each other . therefore the normal passage of pollen wall materials in vesicles through the tapetum for secretion into the locule fails to occur . lipid droplets can be identified in the cytoplasm and inside the _LOCATION_ also tryphine inclusions similar to those observed in the wild type are found in the mutant tapetal cells . _PROTEIN_ in elaioplast numbers are also seen in the mutant whereas in the wild type these are numerous and contain large amounts of lipid materials . this correlates with the _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ of genes linked to fatty acid and lipid biosynthesis seen in the _METHOD_ transcriptomic data . the tapetal cells then go through autophagic breakdown of the _LOCATION_ and necrotic based cell death as opposed to the usual process of tapetal pcd . the _METHOD_ gene was overexpressed under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . high levels of ectopic _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were detected in leaves of the transgenic lines while no _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ was seen in wild type leaf material . the _METHOD_ lines were stunted often forming flowering _METHOD_ with only a minimal rosette . these lines showed a range of severity of phenotypes linked to the level of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . in the most severe cases they showed slow development with a very small rosette densely packed and short flowering stem and the flowers were often abnormal with shorter _PROTEIN_ and sepals which means that the anthers protruded at an earlier developmental stage than normal . however these anthers were also actually shorter than their wild type equivalent . as seen with many of the male sterile mutants the longevity of the plants was enhanced with flowering continuing for much longer than in the wild type . in other less severe lines flower initiation occurred normally however increased levels of branching were observed . in some cases the flowers were semi or completely sterile however this sterility partially broke down as the plants aged . the phenotypes of these sterile flowers were distinct from that of the _METHOD_ mutant with mature pollen degeneration occurring rather than the earlier degeneration of microspores seen in _METHOD_ therefore this is not due to silencing of the _METHOD_ gene . the leaves and tissues of the _METHOD_ overexpression lines were often distorted and twisted this was particularly evident in the anthers that showed increased indentations on the epidermal surface . analysis of pollen from these lines showed an excess deposition of wall material and a loss of the regular structure of the pollen wall . microarray analysis has identified a number of genes with altered _PROTEIN_ in the _METHOD_ mutant buds and three of these which are associated with lipid biosynthesis and pollen wall development and show reproducible downregulation in _METHOD_ buds were analyzed in the _METHOD_ overexpression lines by rt pcr . _PROTEIN_ is observed in wild type buds but no wild type vegetative _PROTEIN_ is seen . however in some of the _METHOD_ overexpression material _PROTEIN_ is seen in both bud and leaf material suggesting that _PROTEIN_ of these floral specific transcripts is being activated by the ectopically _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ .
ler seeds carrying the _METHOD_ ttg mutations were provided by the nottingham arabidopsis stock centre . plant material was sown on levington john innes no . vermiculite perlite compost mix supplemented with g of intercept and grown in controlled environmental chambers at to under illumination of with a h photoperiod . seedlings were selected by _PROTEIN_ of the ttg mutation and the male sterile phenotype confirmed after flowering . lines were _PROTEIN_ and heterozygotes generated by crossing _METHOD_ ttg plants with wild type ler pollen . three constructs were produced that contained the _METHOD_ coding region in three separate regions of the _METHOD_ gene c and t terminal fusions and centrally within the third exon of the _METHOD_ gene . the kb upstream region of _METHOD_ combined with the complete _METHOD_ gene and bp untranslated region was cloned into the pbluescript _PROTEIN_ vector to form _METHOD_ . pcr was used to amplify a kb bamhi fragment from the end of the _METHOD_ gene delete the _METHOD_ stop codon and add three extra amino acids and a bglii site to the end . the _METHOD_ coding region was amplified using primers with a bglii site and xbai and sacii restriction sites . the _METHOD_ terminal region and the _METHOD_ fragment were cut with bglii and then ligated together . this fragment was then digested with bamhi and sacii and ligated into the _METHOD_ clone that had been previously digested with bamhi and sacii to produce _METHOD_ . the untranslated region of the wild type _METHOD_ gene was pcr amplified from the stop codon to bp downstream and an avrii site added to the end and xbai and sacii restriction sites to the end . this fragment was then digested with avrii and sacii and ligated to the _METHOD_ clone that had been previously digested with xbai and sacii . this resulted in an _METHOD_ genomic insert containing kb upstream of the translational start the _METHOD_ genomic coding sequence and the _METHOD_ sequence followed by the _METHOD_ endogenous stop and bp of the _METHOD_ untranslated region to form _METHOD_ c _METHOD_ . inverse pcr was performed to insert bglii sali and xbai restriction sites at the _METHOD_ translational start site . the _METHOD_ plasmid was amplified using primers flanking the translation start site carrying bglii and sali sites and sali and xbai sites respectively . the amplified fragment was digested with sali and ligated and cloned into escherichia coli cells . the _METHOD_ coding sequence was then amplified with flanking bglii and xbai restriction sites and then ligated into the ipcr derived clone that had been previously digested with bglii and xbai . this plasmid was then digested with sphi and hindiii to generate a kb _METHOD_ fragment containing the inserted _METHOD_ coding region . this _METHOD_ _METHOD_ region was then ligated into the _METHOD_ plasmid to form _METHOD_ n _METHOD_ . inverse pcr was repeated to insert bglii sali and xbai restriction sites in the _METHOD_ third exon at base . the _METHOD_ plasmid was amplified using primers flanking the base carrying bglii and sali sites and sali and xbai sites respectively . the amplified fragment was digested with sali and ligated and cloned into e. coli cells . this was then digested with bglii and xbai and ligated with the _METHOD_ coding sequence which had been previously amplified with flanking bglii and xbai restriction sites . this plasmid was then digested with bamhi and sacii and the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ region ligated into _METHOD_ plasmid that had also previously been digested with bamhi and sacii to form _METHOD_ int _METHOD_ . the _METHOD_ cdna was pcr amplified using primers _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ and cloned by recombination into gateway entry vector and then transferred into under the control of the promoter . the construct was then transferred into agrobacterium tumefaciens and wild type arabidopsis thaliana ler plants . plants were screened for presence of the transgene on kanamycin and by pcr . rna was isolated from buds and leaves of the lines carrying the _METHOD_ gene and cdna prepared using of total rna in a reaction . this was used for rt pcr analysis of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and three genes that had shown downregulation in _METHOD_ buds . amplification was performed using of cdna template and the appropriate primer pairs for cycles at for for and for min . control rt pcr analyses were conducted using arabidopsis actin primers . all constructs were checked by sequencing . the _METHOD_ fusions were ligated into after digestion with kpni and sacii . the binary vectors were then transferred into agrobacterium by electroporation . heterozygous _METHOD_ ttg plants were separately transformed with the three _METHOD_ constructs using the floral dip method . seeds were collected and screened on murashige and skoog medium containing of kanamycin . seedlings were selected for the presence of the transgene transferred to soil and allowed to self . plants were screened for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ by pcr and microscopy and for the _METHOD_ linked ttg marker and male fertility . seeds from the plants were harvested individually . complementation of the _METHOD_ mutation by a functional _METHOD_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was indicated by kanamycin resistance the ttg phenotype rt pcr and restoration to full fertility . to ensure that we were observing complementation of the _METHOD_ mutation and not recombination between the ttg and _METHOD_ mutations an excess of plants from each line were analyzed per generation over a minimum of three generations in all cases the transgene cosegregated with the ttg marker and restoration of fertility . lines that were complemented by the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ constructs were also analyzed in the generation without kanamycin selection . these lines showed distorted segregation of fertility with presence of functional transgenes cosegregating with fertility in all cases the lines exhibiting the ttg phenotype were fully fertile and carried the transgene . inflorescences selected from homozygous lines carrying the transgene were analyzed for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ by _METHOD_ and confocal microscopy . a minimum of independent transformants were analyzed . pollen viability was determined by alexander staining . for ultrastructure analysis whole inflorescences were removed from ler and _METHOD_ mutant plants fixed overnight in paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer ph rinsed twice in phosphate buffer and fixed in for h. tissue was dehydrated in an ethanol series and infiltrated with spurr 's resin . individual buds were then dissected and embedded in spurr 's resin . ultrathin sections were cut using a diamond knife on a reichert jung ultracut ultramicrotome and picked up on mesh copper grids . sections were double stained with saturated uranyl acetate in ethanol and lead citrate and examined with a jeol jem electron microscope . for scanning electron microscopy material was fixed in faa dried in an ethanol series coated with gold particles and observed using a jeol jsm scanning electron microscope . total protein was isolated by trichloroacetic acid precipitation separated on nupage to bis tris gels and transferred to nitrocellulose _LOCATION_ in nupage transfer buffer at a constant voltage . the _LOCATION_ were blocked in milk powder in tbs t buffer for h or overnight at . they were then hybridized with rabbit anti _METHOD_ antibody in blocking buffer for h at room temperature washed four times with milk powder in tbs t and reacted with horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti rabbit igg . the cross reacting proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence using ecl protein gel blotting detection reagents according to the manufacturer 's instructions . closed buds were collection as soon as the plants showed three fertile or sterile siliques _METHOD_ . buds were dissected and separated into different groups according to their relative position within the inflorescence taking bud as the oldest unopened bud . all opened flowers and buds that were about to open _PROTEIN_ were discarded . the buds were staged by light microscopy and by rt pcr analysis of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . two pools of unopened buds representing young buds and old buds were collected from ler ler ttg and _METHOD_ ttg plants immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at until required . the number of buds in the inflorescence varies between the wild type and the _METHOD_ mutant therefore the number of buds included in each wild type/mutant group was selected to reflect developmental stage rather than numerical bud classes . for the wild type the old bud group comprised buds to and young buds consisted of buds and younger . for the mutant buds to were included in the old buds group buds and onwards formed the young bud group . the ttg mutation was used as an early marker to help identify homozygous _METHOD_ lines for array analysis therefore control arrays were performed using both ler and ttg bud material . total rna was extracted from to mg of buds . rna samples were dnase treated and then purified using rneasy spin columns . affymetrix microarray analysis was performed by nasc using of total rna per sample as described in the affymetrix genechip technical analysis manual . double stranded crna was synthesized using the superscript choice system with oligo primer fused to a rna polymerase promoter . biotin labeled crna was prepared by cdna in vitro transcription using the bioarray high yield rna transcript labeling kit with biotinylated utp or ctp . the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ genome array was screened using of labeled target crna according to the affymetrix genechip technical analysis manual . genechips were then stained using streptavadin _PROTEIN_ solution and scanned using an agilent genearray scanner . two to three replicates of independently grown material were used . the raw hybridization data were provided by nasc and were normalized using robust multichip average analysis . reproducibility was tested using the standard _LOCATION_ /average calculation to give a measurement of the variability that is independent of the size of the average . a small value indicated that the replicate data were consistent with a fold change between replicates no bigger than . sam was used to analyze the microarray data . triplicates were used and any genes with absent or marginal signal in all of the samples were removed from the analysis . samples were compared across the two developmental stages . a false discovery cutoff of was used for the initial selection of candidate genes and a secondary filtering of _PROTEIN_ fold difference was then applied . genes were also sorted according to their biological and molecular function using information from gene ontology _PROTEIN_ and mapman . first strand cdnas were synthesized from of total rna isolated from different ler and _METHOD_ staged buds and vegetative and reproductive tissues . rt was performed using superscript ii reverse transcriptase and an oligo primer according to the manufacturer 's instructions . amplification was conducted in a volume reaction using of the cdna template or equivalent rt control which lacked superscript ii reverse transcriptase gene specific primers and taq dna polymerase for one cycle of min at followed by cycles of for s to for s for min and a final elongation cycle at for min . the sequences of all primers used are presented in supplemental table online . quantitative rt pcr analyses were performed using the multiplex quantitative pcr system . to quantify copy number a standard curve was produced using serial dilutions of cloned _METHOD_ cdna . reactions were set up using brilliant sybr green qpcr master mix in a final volume of containing of cdna and of the appropriate primers . pcr cycling conditions for amplification were for min and then cycles of for s for min and for min . data acquisition and analyses were performed using real time multiplex quantitative pcr system software . all samples were tested at least twice . the following materials are available in the online
