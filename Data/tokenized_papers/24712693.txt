plants _PROTEIN_ to environmental light conditions by photoreceptor mediated physiological responses but the mechanism by which photoreceptors perceive and transduce the signals is still unresolved . here we used difference gel electrophoresis and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ to characterize early molecular events induced by short blue light exposures in etiolated arabidopsis seedlings . we observed the phosphorylation of phototropin _PROTEIN_ and accumulation of weak chloroplast movement under blue light _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ fraction after blue light irradiation . over spots could be observed for the two rows of _PROTEIN_ spots in the de gels and eight novel phosphorylated ser/thr sites were identified in the n terminus and hinge regions of _PROTEIN_ in vivo . blue light caused ubiquitination of _PROTEIN_ and of _PROTEIN_ was identified as a putative ubiquitination site . our study indicates that post translational modification of _PROTEIN_ is more complex than previously reported .
blue light acts as an environmental cue to regulate plant growth and development but its perception and transduction by plants remains poorly characterized . to understand better the early events of blue light signaling the experimental protocol illustrated in figure was employed to study the effect of blue light on the proteome of arabidopsis seedlings . here we used dige coupled with tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ to identify early blue light responsive proteins and protein modifications . four day old etiolated seedlings were irradiated with blue light at a fluence rate of m s for min a total fluence that is known to saturate the phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ because blue light induced phototropism is initiated by _LOCATION_ associated receptors _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ crude _LOCATION_ proteins from blue light irradiated and unirradiated seedlings were compared by dige . two rows of high molecular weight proteins showed clear mobility shifts in which the more acidic ones showed up only after irradiation and exhibited slightly lower electrophoretic mobility whereas the more basic ones disappeared after irradiation which is the pattern that one would expect to see for light induced protein phosphorylation . dige analysis of the blue light response in the microsomal fraction of day old etiolated arabidopsis seedlings . col seedlings were irradiated with blue light for min and microsomal proteins from both control and irradiated seedlings were analyzed by dige . superimposed dige image of the upper half of a gel . proteins _METHOD_ induced by blue light treatment appear as red spots and those _PROTEIN_ by the treatment appear green whereas those remaining constant appear yellow . spots that were characterized by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ are highlighted by arrows and their identities are listed in table _PROTEIN_ . zoomed in dige overlay image showing the blue light stimulated accumulation of _PROTEIN_ in the microsomal fraction . identities of the row of _PROTEIN_ spots were further confirmed by dige analysis of the microsomal protein of the etiolated seedlings of the _PROTEIN_ and gl mutants . the estimated ph ranges following ief are indicated above the gel images in figures . in gel trypsin digestion of an excised spot followed by liquid chromatography tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ identified these spots as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a result that was expected because _PROTEIN_ has an apparent size of kda . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the identities of the row of _PROTEIN_ spots from the unilluminated control seedlings were further confirmed by dige comparison of _PROTEIN_ with its genetic background gl as these spots disappeared in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . two other blue light responsive protein spots with higher electrophoretic mobility were also identified as _PROTEIN_ which are likely the partial degradation products of _PROTEIN_ . in addition to _PROTEIN_ a blue light responsive protein was identified as _PROTEIN_ an acidic high molecular weight protein regulating the movement velocity of chloroplast photorelocation . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was previously shown to be predominantly in the soluble fraction of the proteome with only a little found in the microsomal fractions . _PROTEIN_ this is in agreement with its low abundance in the microsomal fraction in our study . the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ protein in the microsomal fraction after blue light irradiation suggests that light induces _PROTEIN_ association with the cell _LOCATION_ or some other cellular structure . as shown in figure a proteins spots responsive to blue light were screened by decyder software and were further characterized by _METHOD_ . the spot volume ratios of blue light irradiated to untreated or untreated to irradiated and the p values of the student s t test of the comparison were calculated from three biological replicates . for the _METHOD_ identification the number of unique peptides percentage of sequence coverage and e value for each spot are listed . the two rows of _PROTEIN_ spots extended from the basic to the acidic region in the gel shown in figure a . to determine whether all of these spots are the result of differential phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ protein phosphatase treatment which hydrolyzes the phosphate groups from serine threonine tyrosine and histidine residues was performed on the microsomal proteins from both dark and blue light irradiated seedlings . in both cases phosphatase treatment shifted _PROTEIN_ to the more basic regions and increased its electrophoretic mobility . however _PROTEIN_ was still found as a string of spots in the de gels after the phosphatase treatment possibly the result of incomplete phosphatase digestion and/or post translational modifications other than phosphorylation . phosphorylation is the major form of _PROTEIN_ post translational modification as indicated by phosphatase treatment . phosphatase treatment induced shifts of _PROTEIN_ spots in microsomal protein from both blue light irradiated and control seedlings . on the left blue and indicates the comparison of phosphatase treated verse untreated microsomal proteins from blue light irradiated seedlings by dige and dark and indicates the comparison of phosphatase treated verse untreated proteins from unirradiated seedlings . proteins that show up in the phosphatase treated samples appear red whereas those in the untreated samples are green . red arrows point to _PROTEIN_ spots from samples of irradiated seedlings green arrows point to those from the unirradiated samples and white arrows point to those from phosphatase treated proteins . salomon et al . _PROTEIN_ found that the phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ in avena sativa was in some way hierarchical with certain sites phosphorylated at low blue light fluences and other sites phosphorylated at higher blue light fluences . we applied dige to study the time dependent _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation and dephosphorylation patterns in arabidopsis . as shown in figure a a min irradiation at a fluence rate of m stimulated _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation as indicated by the acidic shift . a min irradiation shifted _PROTEIN_ further to the more acidic regions and appeared to saturate _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation as longer time treatment did not cause any further spot shifts in the acidic regions . in contrast dephosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ in a sequential order was observed when the saturation illuminated seedlings were kept in the dark . after a min recovery period in darkness the charges in _PROTEIN_ were shifted partially toward a more basic pi as shown on the dige gel and after min there were no further shifts in electrophoretic mobility . time dependent _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation and dephosphorylation after irradiation of dark grown seedlings . etiolated col seedlings were irradiated with blue light for the indicated times and the microsomal proteins from irradiated and unirradiated samples were compared by dige . shown are the overlay images containing the _PROTEIN_ region . after saturating irradiation for min the etiolated seedlings were kept in the dark . the subsequent _PROTEIN_ dephosphorylation was monitored by dige comparing the microsomal protein from the col seedling collected at the time points indicated with that of the control samples . two previous studies identified eight different in vivo _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation sites _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but the large number of _PROTEIN_ spots with distinct pi values that were shifted by protein phosphatase treatment suggested the existence of additional _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation sites . to identify other possible _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation sites an anti _METHOD_ antibody was used to immunoprecipitate _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ from the microsomal proteins of both irradiated and unirradiated arabidopsis seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ after separation by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins from dark grown seedlings three phosphorylated ser sites were observed with all of them located in the n terminus . in the illuminated samples phosphorylation sites were identified which were localized both to the n terminus and the hinge region between _PROTEIN_ and including two sites that were also detected in the dark sample . a representative annotated tandem _METHOD_ spectrum of _PROTEIN_ phosphopeptides is shown in figure _PROTEIN_ . in all we report distinct ser/thr residues phosphorylated in vivo . because six of the sites were reported to be phosphrylated in vivo either in the dark or in illuminated samples _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ we report here eight additional in vivo phosphorylated sites . summary of known _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation sites . phosphorylated ser/thr sites identified from blue light treated tissues are shown above the protein box whereas those identified from the dark tissues are shown below the protein box . ser/thr sites in black were identified both in this study and in previous studies _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ those in blue were not identified in this study but were reported previously and those in red are new sites identified in this study . phosphorylated was identified from _PROTEIN_ protein in both dark and irradiated seedlings in this study but it was identified only from _PROTEIN_ protein in dark seedlings in a previous study . _PROTEIN_ in summary eight new unique sites were identified in this study . representative cid _METHOD_ spectrum of _PROTEIN_ obtained from a precursor ion with a m/z value of corresponding to a phosphorylated peptide spanning the residues of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . phosphorylated serine is shown in the sequence as sp . the observed b and y product ion peaks are labeled accordingly with the subscripts denoting their position in the identified peptide . intense ions corresponding to neutral losses from the labeled sequence ions are indicated by . in the peptide sequence m denotes oxidized methionine . figure shows a scheme illustrating the sites along the _PROTEIN_ protein . _METHOD_ spectra for peptides in this table are provided in figure and in . s and t represent phosphorylation sites . m represents oxidized methionine . in a similar study inoue et al . identified phosphorylated ser/thr residues in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ by lc _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ these sites are located both in the n terminus and hinge regions . interestingly sequence alignment showed that _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ located in a highly conserved amino acid region just before _PROTEIN_ domain of _PROTEIN_ is the only known conserved site phosphorylated in both proteins in vivo . ubiquitination of _PROTEIN_ has been shown to be involved in phototropic responses _PROTEIN_ but the ubiquitination site of _PROTEIN_ have not yet been characterized . key features for detection of potential ubiquitin attachment sites on tryptic peptides are the missed cleavage of the modified lysine together with a shift of da in both the _METHOD_ of the precursor ion and the _METHOD_ of sequence fragment ions in the _METHOD_ spectrum that would contain the ubiquitin modified site of the peptide . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ these gg remnants result from the cleavage by trypsin of the original ubiquitin in the c terminal side or r on its c terminal _PROTEIN_ sequence . _PROTEIN_ accordingly a unique ubiquitination site localized in the region was observed in the spectrum of the peptide of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ from blue light irradiated seedlings but it was not observed in the dark controls . to document that ubiquitination of _PROTEIN_ was regulated by blue light irradiation _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins immunoprecipitated by an anti _METHOD_ antibody were immunoblotted with an anti ubiquitin _PROTEIN_ antibody that detects both mono and polyubiquitinylated proteins . immunoblot assays show that _PROTEIN_ ubiquitination was enhanced after blue light irradiation whereas it was reduced during recovery in the dark in a pattern similar to that of _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation . cid _METHOD_ spectrum obtained from a precursor ion with a m/z value of corresponding to a ubiquitinated peptide spanning residues of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . ubiquitinated lysine is shown in the sequence as kgg as it is labeled by the digly tryptic remnant of ubiquitin . the observed sequence ions are displayed . ubiquitination of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is regulated by blue light . arabidopsis seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were grown in the dark for days . thereafter one third of the samples were collected immediately under dim safe light another third were irradiated with blue light for min and the remaining seedlings were incubated in the dark for min after min of blue light irradiation . microsomal proteins were extracted from these seedlings and immunoprecipitated with an anti _METHOD_ antibody . the microsomal proteins and the immunoprecipitates _METHOD_ were resolved by a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gel transferred to a nitrocellulose _LOCATION_ stained by deep purple _METHOD_ stain and detected by an anti ubiquitin antibody . in panel a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with lower and higher electrophoretic mobilities is marked with stars . in panel b ubiquitination of _PROTEIN_ is marked with a star .

covered with a minimum volume of . after overnight digestion at peptides were extracted twice with a solution containing acetonitrile and formic acid . the extracted digests were vacuum dried and resuspended in of formic acid in water and then analyzed by lc _METHOD_ . the digests were separated by nanoflow liquid chromatography using a mm reverse phase ultra column at a flow rate of nl/min in an agilent high performance liquid chromatography system . mobile phase a was formic acid in water and mobile phase b was formic acid in acetonitrile . following equilibration of the column in solvent b one half of each digest was injected and then the organic content of the mobile phase was increased linearly to over min and then to in min . the liquid chromatography eluate was coupled to a
