plants achieve remarkable plasticity in shoot system architecture by regulating the activity of secondary shoot _METHOD_ laid down in the axil of each leaf . axillary meristem activity and hence shoot branching is regulated by a network of interacting hormonal signals that move through the plant . among these auxin moving down the plant in the _PROTEIN_ stem indirectly inhibits axillary bud outgrowth and an as yet undefined hormone the synthesis of which in arabidopsis requires _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ moves up the plant and also inhibits shoot branching . since the axillary buds of _PROTEIN_ mutants are resistant to the inhibitory effects of apically supplied auxin auxin and the max dependent hormone must interact to inhibit branching .
many mutants in the transcription regulating auxin signaling pathway have shoot branching defects and auxin response defects in their buds demonstrating that this pathway regulates bud outgrowth and apical dominance citation . similarly mutations in the max pathway genes result in increased branching and _PROTEIN_ buds have been shown to be resistant to apical auxin citation . where tested none of these mutants has altered levels or timing of axillary meristem formation suggesting that they all act primarily at the stage of bud growth regulation citation . to investigate the relationship between these pathways in more detail we analyzed branching in the _PROTEIN_ mutant which is deficient in auxin signaling and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we also constructed double mutants between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to further this analysis . we used two assays to analyze bud activity namely measurements of rosette branching in mature plants and the growth response of buds on excised nodes to apically supplied auxin . we found that branching from the rosette is markedly increased in both max and _PROTEIN_ mutants compared to wild type with max mutants having higher levels of branching than _PROTEIN_ plants . the outgrowth response of buds on excised nodes to apically applied auxin was significantly greater in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type indicative of reduced auxin sensitivity . however _PROTEIN_ buds were more resistant than max buds . thus while max plants have higher branching levels _PROTEIN_ buds show less inhibition of bud outgrowth by auxin . these data indicate that a proportion of the increased branching in the max mutants can not be explained by a deficiency in _PROTEIN_ mediated signaling _PROTEIN_ and likewise there is a proportion of the auxin resistance in _PROTEIN_ buds that is not due to a deficiency in the max pathway . furthermore when the double mutants were analyzed both the number of rosette branches _PROTEIN_ and the degree of auxin resistance _PROTEIN_ were found to be greater than those observed in either parent . indeed the _PROTEIN_ and max phenotypes are substantially additive with double mutant buds showing little or no auxin response at all . these results indicate that the max pathway and _PROTEIN_ mediated auxin signaling act largely independently in the regulation of shoot branching . since the _PROTEIN_ mutant is defective in a vast array of auxin responses citation the discovery of an _PROTEIN_ independent auxin response is significant . since previous reports have linked auxin transport and shoot branching citation we investigated whether the max pathway might regulate auxin transport . auxin is transported basipetally down the stem and this transport is dependent on members of the _PROTEIN_ family of auxin efflux facilitators which are basally localized in the cells of the xylem parenchyma and mediate directional movement of auxin down the stem citation . we analyzed bulk transport of radio labeled auxin in max mutants relative to wild type . the apical ends of mm excised stem segments were incubated in radiolabel for hr and the amount transported into the basal mm was then measured . the max mutants were found to have a marked increase in the ability to transport auxin relative to wild type . this assay is demonstrably npa sensitive and therefore presumably measures only active transport . to determine whether this result was due to change in the capacity for auxin transport or in the rate of auxin transport we used a pulse chase assay . auxin was loaded into the apical ends of mm _PROTEIN_ and wild type stem segments for hr . radio labeled auxin was then collected as it emerged from the basal ends of the stem segments in min windows . again this assay is fully npa sensitive and so presumably measures active transport . the time course of emergence of the loaded auxin was very similar for _PROTEIN_ and wild type with a peak in emergence at around hr but for each time window more auxin emerged from the _PROTEIN_ stem than the wild type . this suggests that the _PROTEIN_ effect of the _PROTEIN_ mutation is on auxin transport capacity rather than transport rate . it should be noted that max mutant _METHOD_ have wild type anatomy so for example these increases in auxin transport do not arise from differences in the amount of vasculature between genotypes . if transport capacity is severely limiting in wild type _METHOD_ then the increase in transport capacity in the max mutants might allow auxin to flow unimpeded down the stem resulting in depletion of auxin in the node reduced activity through the auxin signaling pathway and thus increased bud outgrowth . to test this hypothesis we examined activity of the auxin responsive gus promoter reporter construct in the max mutants . this reporter is a generally reliable indicator of the activity of the _PROTEIN_ auxin signaling pathway and often reflects auxin levels citation . directly contrary to the idea of reduced auxin signaling at the node the max mutants have a large increase in gus activity in the stem vasculature relative to wild type both in basal and apical nodes . these data are consistent with increased auxin levels throughout the transport stream suggesting that the increased transport capacity in max mutant _METHOD_ results in more auxin in transit through the stem at any one time . to investigate whether the increased auxin transport capacity is necessary for the branching phenotype of max mutants we tested the effect of pharmacologically inhibiting auxin transport on the max phenotype via the well characterized inhibitor of auxin transport npa . we first confirmed that auxin transport in the max mutants is npa sensitive and determined that concentrations in the order of restore auxin transport to approximately wild type levels . we then tested the effect of this concentration of npa on shoot branching and bud responses to apical auxin . whole plants were treated with npa by its addition to the agar solidified medium of plants grown in sterile culture . increasing doses of npa reduced shoot branching up to concentrations of . at npa treatment resulted in increased branching compared to npa . these results suggest that the increased auxin transport of the max mutants causes the increased branching phenotype but that auxin transport levels below wild type also promote branching . this latter observation corresponds well with classical data showing that inhibiting auxin transport in wild type plants leads to bud outgrowth because auxin is prevented from reaching the node citation and also with the phenotype of the transport inhibitor _PROTEIN_ mutant which has reduced auxin transport and increased branching citation . we have previously shown that treatment with npa leads to increased bud outgrowth in wild type plants which agrees with the long established idea that too little auxin transport also leads to increased shoot branching citation . when we tested the effect of npa on bud auxin response we found that while low concentrations of npa do not affect bud outgrowth at all npa completely restores a wild type auxin response to max buds . npa has no effect on max bud outgrowth in the absence of apical auxin suggesting that the effect of npa is on auxin transport in the stem and not on the buds directly . this effect of npa holds for all the max mutants but not _PROTEIN_ which does not have increased auxin transport . these data confirm both the causal relationship between increased auxin transport capacity and the max branching phenotype and an independent mechanism of action of the max and _PROTEIN_ pathways . since the family of _PROTEIN_ auxin transport facilitator proteins has been shown to mediate the amount and direction of _PROTEIN_ auxin transport citation we investigated whether they might be targets of the max pathway in the regulation of auxin transport . we examined localization of the well characterized _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ translational fusion construct citation in inflorescence _METHOD_ of max mutants by confocal microscopy . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein levels were clearly elevated in the vascular bundles of max mutants compared to wild type . reporter protein levels were particularly stronger in the xylem tissue adjacent to the cambial region . in longitudinal sections of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the majority of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed typical basal localization in xylem parenchyma cells however the amount of protein in the basal cell _LOCATION_ was increased and a significant fraction was clearly not basally localized . to test whether these changes in _PROTEIN_ levels are due to transcriptional upregulation we used a _PROTEIN_ gus transcriptional fusion reporter construct . _PROTEIN_ gus activity was noticeably elevated in _PROTEIN_ inflorescence _METHOD_ compared to wild type . we extended this analysis to other _PROTEIN_ genes via semiquantitative rt pcr and we found that levels of transcripts from _PROTEIN_ and and probably _PROTEIN_ and are increased although _PROTEIN_ was downregulated in max mutants relative to wild type . to test whether this elevated level of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is causally related to the increased branching phenotype of the max mutants we constructed _PROTEIN_ max double mutants and found that they have significantly reduced branching relative to max single mutants showing that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is important for the max phenotype . branching was not returned to completely wild type levels in _PROTEIN_ max double mutants which we ascribe to the upregulation of other _PROTEIN_ proteins in the max mutant backgrounds . consistent with this we found that there is greater residual auxin transport in _PROTEIN_ max compared to _PROTEIN_ . the altered _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ genes is still observed in _PROTEIN_ max double mutants suggesting that it is not a result of feedback from increased branching or auxin levels in the stem but rather is a direct effect of lack of max signaling . based on these data we propose that the max pathway regulates branching by modulating auxin transport capacity through control of _PROTEIN_ transcript levels . flavonoids are naturally occurring inhibitors of auxin transport citation . we found that like npa the flavonoid naringenin is able to restore wild type apical auxin responses to max mutant buds although at much higher concentrations than npa consistent with its lower activity . a role for flavonoids in shoot branching control has previously been reported through the analysis of a flavonoid deficient mutant . the transparent mutant lacks the enzyme _PROTEIN_ synthase and thus makes no flavonoids at all resulting in a maternal effect yellow seed phenotype citation . one allele of this mutant has been reported to confer a bushy phenotype citation suggesting a link between auxin transport flavonoids and shoot branching . to investigate potential interactions between flavonoids and the max pathway we attempted to construct double mutants between and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . however during this process we found that the branching phenotype of results from a _PROTEIN_ mutation in . to confirm this a backcross between and col was performed which in the showed independent segregation of the pigment accumulation and branching phenotypes . the _PROTEIN_ allele from _PROTEIN_ was sequenced and found to contain a premature stop codon in the second exon . these data demonstrate that does not confer a branching phenotype which was confirmed with an independent allele in addition to the one backcrossed out of the line . both alleles confer levels of branching not significantly different from wild type and significantly less than . since completely flavonoid deficient plants have wild type branching flavonoids can not be important to produce normal branching patterns . furthermore since the _PROTEIN_ double mutant is bushy flavonoids are also not required for elaboration of the max phenotype . this raises questions about the link between increased auxin transport and increased branching observed in the max mutants since mutants have been reported to have increased auxin transport and thus would be predicted to have increased branching . to address this question we compared auxin transport in the _METHOD_ of and the max mutants . we found modest but significant increases in auxin transport in but no real difference from wild type in . the effects of the mutants are therefore much smaller in the stem than the increases observed in the max mutants and thus are likely not large enough to cause detectable branching phenotypes . it should be noted however that these data do not contradict previous reports showing larger increases in auxin transport in the seedlings of citation .
