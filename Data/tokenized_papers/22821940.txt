the phytohormone abscisic acid plays pivotal roles in the regulation of developmental and environmental responses in plants . identification of cytoplasmic aba receptors enabled the elucidation of the _PROTEIN_ aba signalling pathway connecting aba perception to either _LOCATION_ events or the action of several transporters . however the physiological functions of aba in cellular processes largely remain unknown . to obtain greater insight into the aba response genetic screening was performed to isolate aba related mutants of arabidopsis and several novel aba hypersensitive mutants were isolated . one of those characterized further . map based cloning showed that _PROTEIN_ encodes a _PROTEIN_ type protein which has potential roles in rna editing . an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein indicated that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ localized to the mitochondria . consistent with this observation the _PROTEIN_ transcript which normally undergoes rna editing lacks a single rna editing event conferring a conversion of an amino acid residue in _PROTEIN_ mutants . the geminating _PROTEIN_ seeds have higher levels of reactive oxygen species responsive genes . presumably partial impairment of mitochondrial function caused by an amino acid conversion in one of the complex i components induces redox imbalance which in turn confers an abnormal response to the plant hormone .
accumulation of aba in seeds causes aba hypersensitivity at germination . it was previously shown that the seeds of _PROTEIN_ an aba hypersensitive mutant have higher endogenous aba levels . it is postulated that higher levels of endogenous aba cause an enhanced aba response . in order to isolate mutants that have defects downstream of aba synthesis rather than in aba synthesis or catabolism _PROTEIN_ that affect endogenous aba levels need to be eliminated or reduced . to this end the _PROTEIN_ mutant was used which has reduced endogenous aba levels due to a defect in the short chain dehydrogenase enzyme and hence in aba biosynthesis . the _PROTEIN_ seeds were mutagenized with _METHOD_ and progeny were obtained . seeds were sown on agar medium supplemented with the aba analogue _PROTEIN_ or aba and germination was induced . after several days ungerminated or no green individuals were collected and tested for their aba hypersensitivity during germination in the next generation . this screening isolated five aba hypersensitive candidates which were named as aba hypersensitive germination _PROTEIN_ . these mutants exhibited similar degrees of aba hypersensitivity in the presence of the _PROTEIN_ . aba sensitivity of new aba hypersensitive mutants at germination . various mutant seeds were sown on the medium containing various concentrations of aba . germination efficiency is determined by counting seedlings with green cotyledons every day for a week . the data shows the germination efficiency at day mean of four independent experiments . _LOCATION_ bars indicate standard deviation . after segregation of the _PROTEIN_ mutation and a backcross to the wild type three mutants namely _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ retained strong phenotypes enough to conduct mapping procedures . these test crosses revealed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are recessive while _PROTEIN_ is dominant . for genetic mapping these mutants were crossed with ler wild type plants and progeny were obtained . pcr marker based rough mapping with approximately lines with aba hypersensitivity indicated that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are located at the bottom of chromosome the top of the chromosome and the bottom of chromosome respectively . previously several other aba hypersensitive mutants were reported . the locus of _PROTEIN_ is close to that of _PROTEIN_ but sequencing of the _PROTEIN_ gene in the _PROTEIN_ mutant confirmed that these mutants are not allelic . _PROTEIN_ and were mapped to the lower arm of chromosome and the middle part of chromosome respectively but these regions were unlinked to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ loci . therefore _PROTEIN_ are new aba hypersensitive loci . chromosomal positions of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . schematic representation of the position of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ loci . neighbouring known aba hypersensitive loci are shown as white boxes . in this study _PROTEIN_ was chosen for further analysis because of the relative clarity of its phenotype . it was postulated that _PROTEIN_ does not increase the endogenous aba levels because this mutant was isolated in the _PROTEIN_ background that has reduced aba biosynthetic activity . indeed the endogenous aba levels in _PROTEIN_ dry seeds were lower than the wild type and those in imbibed seeds were the same as wild type implying that _PROTEIN_ affects aba signalling or cellular responses to aba rather than aba biosynthesis or catabolism . next the responses of _PROTEIN_ mutants to osmotic and salinity stresses were examined . as shown in the germination levels of _PROTEIN_ are slightly lower than those of the wild type controls on an agar plate containing mannitol but are not as low as the strong aba hypersensitive mutant _LOCATION_ . when subjected to salinity stress _PROTEIN_ apparently germinates less effectively than the wild type but again not as little as _LOCATION_ . these data imply that _PROTEIN_ affects not only aba response but also abiotic stress response at germination . sugar response is closely linked with aba response . therefore the sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ and sucrose was examined and it was found that it is slightly enhanced at germination . by contrast with the phenotypes observed at germination the aba hypersensitivity of _PROTEIN_ is hardly detected in seedlings or adult plants suggesting that _PROTEIN_ function is required for germination or early seedling growth stages . endogenous aba content of _PROTEIN_ . endogenous aba content of dry seeds and imbibed seeds was measured . the data shows the mean of three independent experiments . _LOCATION_ bars indicate standard deviation . salt or hyper osmotic stress sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ . germination efficiency was analysed in the presence of nacl or mannitol . wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _LOCATION_ seeds were sown on _METHOD_ sucrose plates containing various concentrations of nacl or mannitol . germinating seedlings with greening cotyledons were counted . the data shown are means of three independent experiments . _LOCATION_ bar indicates standard deviation . responses to other plant hormones were also examined . interestingly the germination of _PROTEIN_ was more strongly inhibited by jasmonic acid than wild type . the responses to auxin cytokinin gibberellin ethylene and brassinosteroid were examined using elongation of the _PROTEIN_ root or hypocotyl . however _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings did not exhibit any detectable abnormalities in their responses to these plant hormones . the results described above suggest that _PROTEIN_ demonstrates an enhanced sensitivity to aba during germination . next the _PROTEIN_ responses to aba were examined in adult plants . root elongation and the _PROTEIN_ of aba responsive genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mutants displayed no apparent differences when compared with those responses in wild type plants . these data are consistent with the idea that _PROTEIN_ function is required only in seeds or young seedlings . using pcr based molecular markers the predicted _PROTEIN_ locus was fine mapped by analysing the chromosomal dna obtained from aba hypersensitive progeny from a test cross with the ler wild type . the putative _PROTEIN_ region was narrowed to the region spanning about kbp where genes are located according to the arabidopsis information database . the genomic regions corresponding to each of these genes were sequenced in _PROTEIN_ backgrounds and two base substitutions were found in the gene which is predicted to encode a pentatricopeptide repeat protein _PROTEIN_ . while the wild type protein is predicted to have _PROTEIN_ repeats the upstream base substitution generates a nonsense mutation resulting in a truncated polypeptide . it has been shown that plants have numerous _PROTEIN_ genes . arabidopsis has _PROTEIN_ genes . among them dozens of _PROTEIN_ have been intensely investigated and their targets identified . _PROTEIN_ are categorized into several groups or classes on the basis of the motif composition of the proteins . _PROTEIN_ belongs to the e _PROTEIN_ family most of which are involved in rna editing and has the highest similarity to _PROTEIN_ which edits the second cytosine residue of _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ transcripts . the c terminal e motif is required for the editing function of _PROTEIN_ and another e class _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . therefore the nonsense _PROTEIN_ mutation which causes the lack of c terminal _PROTEIN_ repeats e and e motifs is most likely responsible for the malfunction of the _PROTEIN_ gene product . structure of _PROTEIN_ . schematic representation of _PROTEIN_ protein . grey box indicates the _PROTEIN_ motif . the approximate position of the _PROTEIN_ mutation site is shown . alignment of _PROTEIN_ motifs of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ motifs are shown with the position and type of _PROTEIN_ motif . the amino acid positions followed the annotation of in the arabidopsis information resource . in order to confirm that is _PROTEIN_ a complementation analysis was conducted . the genomic dna containing with a untranslated region and a untranslated region was introduced into the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the resultant transgenic lines showed a normal aba response at germination . the transgenic lines also exhibited normal sensitivities to _PROTEIN_ and methyl jasmonic acid at germination . based on these data it is concluded that _PROTEIN_ is indeed . the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ is quite low according to public transcriptome databases . database searches also revealed no previously submitted cdnas for this gene . an attempt was made to detect transcripts by using rt pcr and it was found that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ at quite a low level but ubiquitously . the genome sequence of _PROTEIN_ reveals multiple in frame _PROTEIN_ codons . since information on transcript sequences is lacking it is not known which _PROTEIN_ codon is used as the start codon . when the most upstream _PROTEIN_ codon is utilized as the initiation codon the polypeptide is predicted to localize mostly to the cytoplasm . on the other hand when a downstream _PROTEIN_ codon is utilized the gene product is predicted to function in _LOCATION_ or the secretory pathway . _PROTEIN_ is closely related to _PROTEIN_ which is known to function in _LOCATION_ . however a recent proteomic study suggested that _PROTEIN_ localizes at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to determine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ the n terminal portion of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was fused to a _METHOD_ gene to form the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion gene . when a plasmid dna harbouring this fusion gene was introduced to the arabidopsis mesophyll protoplast _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in a granule like structure in the cytoplasm . most of the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ overlapped with a mitotracker red signal implying that _PROTEIN_ localizes to the mitochondria . however the number of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals was apparently less than the mitochondrial signal obtained with mitotracker red . presumably _PROTEIN_ localizes to mitochondria only under some conditions . similar but weaker spatial _METHOD_ patterns were observed with a full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein . hardly any _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected when the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins that use the downstream _PROTEIN_ codon as the initiation codon was examined . subcellular localization of an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_

dotted line outlines the cell shape . the results described above indicate that _PROTEIN_ fused _METHOD_ localizes to mitochondria suggesting that _PROTEIN_ plays a role in mrna processing in mitochondria particularly in rna editing . there are about editing sites in mitochondrial mrna . in addition the possibility can not be excluded that _PROTEIN_ is involved in rna editing in the _LOCATION_ because _PROTEIN_ most resembles _PROTEIN_ which functions in the _LOCATION_ . an examination of the status of each potential editing site one by one would be both time and labour consuming . recently the rna recognition code of editing _PROTEIN_ proteins was identified namely the _PROTEIN_ code . the _PROTEIN_ code enables in silico prediction of the candidate target site for _PROTEIN_ protein . the prediction using the _PROTEIN_ code allowed us to narrow the candidate _PROTEIN_ editing sites to around sites . cdna fragments containing these candidate editing sites were synthesized using total rna isolated from _PROTEIN_ and wild type seedlings and sequenced . consequently it was found that a c to u edit in the _PROTEIN_ transcript at nucleotide position _PROTEIN_ was absent in the mutant while neighbouring sites _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were edited correctly . more than mitochondrial editing sites were examined and all of the known _LOCATION_ editing sites including _PROTEIN_ and psbz and no other differences in the rna editing states between _PROTEIN_ and wild type rna were detected . it should be noted however that not all rna editing sites could be examined . in addition some of the known rna editing sites were missed and a few novel rna editing candidates found in mitochondrial transcripts obtained from germinating wild type seeds . therefore the possibility can not be excluded that _PROTEIN_ is also responsible for other rna editing sites of mitochondrial transcripts . proper rna editing at _PROTEIN_ was observed in the transgenic _PROTEIN_ mutants possessing the wild type _PROTEIN_ transgene confirming that _PROTEIN_ is required for _PROTEIN_ rna editing . since the other editing sites of _PROTEIN_ are edited as reported previously and any abnormally spliced mrnas were not detected the _PROTEIN_ mutation presumably does not affect any other rna processing steps of _PROTEIN_ transcripts . although _PROTEIN_ exhibits an aba hypersensitive phenotype at the seed or young seedling stages the defect of _PROTEIN_ rna editing was detected in the adult _PROTEIN_ plant implying that _PROTEIN_ functions at any stages consistent with the result of rt pcr . the c to u editing at _PROTEIN_ converts _PROTEIN_ to cys where hydrophobic residues are found in other _METHOD_ . presumably editing _PROTEIN_ is required for its proper function in complex i . target rna editing site of _PROTEIN_ . sequence _METHOD_ around the _PROTEIN_ editing site of the _PROTEIN_ cdna obtained from wild type or _PROTEIN_ plants . red green blue or

_PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the number indicates the position of the first amino acid in the alignment . previous reports on the _PROTEIN_ proteins functioning in mitochondria demonstrated that dysfunction of these _PROTEIN_ proteins resulted in higher reactive oxygen species accumulation or redox imbalance in the cell . presumably an impaired respiration chain produces ros . it is possible that the _PROTEIN_ mutation also confers such effect in germinating seeds . to see the cellular redox imbalance the _PROTEIN_ patterns of four reactive oxygen stress inducible genes were examined . gadjev et al . reported various ros inducible genes . among the major ros inducible genes encoding an unknown protein encoding a trypsin inhibitor protein encoding glutathione s transferase tau and encoding _PROTEIN_ were chosen because these genes _PROTEIN_ in seeds according to the public microarray database . to see the _PROTEIN_ level in germinating seeds total mrna was prepared from seeds which were imbibed at for d and incubated at for under the lights and used for qrt pcr experiments . as shown in mrna levels of all these genes were higher in _PROTEIN_ than the wild type . it was confirmed that the difference in those mrna levels were not due to the small difference in germination timing between _PROTEIN_ and the wild type . these results suggest that the defect in _PROTEIN_ editing caused by _PROTEIN_ induces a redox imbalance in geminating seeds as reported in other _PROTEIN_ defect mutants . gene _PROTEIN_ of ros responsive genes in _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ levels of ros inducible genes in _PROTEIN_ seeds and in wild type seeds quantified by qrt pcr are shown . the _PROTEIN_ level of each gene is normalized to that of wild type seeds . asterisks and indicate the p
