in plants g proteins modulate signaling by the stress hormone abscisic acid . we identify and characterize two novel arabidopsis proteins that show homology to an orphan vertebrate _PROTEIN_ and interact with the sole arabidopsis g protein subunit _PROTEIN_ but also have intrinsic _PROTEIN_ binding and _PROTEIN_ activity . we have named these proteins g pcr t ype g proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . arabidopsis mutants lacking both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ exhibit aba hyposensitivity . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ bind aba specifically . the gdp bound form of the _PROTEIN_ exhibits greater aba binding than the _PROTEIN_ bound form the _PROTEIN_ activity of the _PROTEIN_ is inhibited by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ null mutants exhibit aba hypersensitive phenotypes . these results predict that unusually it is the gdp bound not the _PROTEIN_ bound form of the _PROTEIN_ that actively relays the signal . we propose that _PROTEIN_ proteins function both as a new type of g protein and as a class of _LOCATION_ localized aba receptors .
_PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ show amino acid sequence identity with each other and identity and similarity with . the similarity extends throughout the length of the proteins . blast analysis identifies close homologs of these proteins in monocot and dicot plants vertebrates invertebrates fungi and unicellular _METHOD_ . the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ proteins show about identity and similarity at the amino acid level with their plant homologs whereas sequence identity and sequence similarity are observed with vertebrate and nonvertebrate animals . lower homology is observed with fungi and unicellular _METHOD_ . to assess the evolutionary relationship between these proteins we performed a phylogenetic analysis . plants form a separate clade from other _METHOD_ and the unicellular green alga chlamydomonas groups with the other lower _METHOD_ suggesting a possible sequence divergence when unicellular and multicellular _METHOD_ diverged . prosite motif analysis identified a conserved _PROTEIN_ /gtp binding region in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . this motif is highly conserved in all the plant proteins however the similarity with non plant proteins is relatively low with little conservation of the first nine amino acids at the junction of the predicted th intracellular loop . the _PROTEIN_ charged glutamic acid at position of _PROTEIN_ is conserved in all plant species but is replaced by a neutral uncharged amide in the non plant proteins . the large third intracellular loop of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ also has a region showing similarity to the degenerate ras _PROTEIN_ activating protein domain _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ p with and similarity respectively _PROTEIN_ . this region also shows high sequence conservation in all the plant proteins analyzed but is divergent elsewhere . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have nine predicted transmembrane domains similar to human . as anticipated the _PROTEIN_ epitope tagged versions of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins are detected mostly in the total microsomal fractions isolated from transgenic arabidopsis plants . transient _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts shows localization of _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ at the cell periphery . purified recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and proteins were analyzed for _PROTEIN_ binding and _PROTEIN_ activity using a real time assay based on bodipy _PROTEIN_ or bodipy _PROTEIN_ in which _METHOD_ increases upon binding of the _METHOD_ labeled nucleotide and _PROTEIN_ upon _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis . we first validated this method using commercially available bovine g protein . as expected the bovine protein showed specific binding of a nonhydrolyzable _PROTEIN_ bodipy _PROTEIN_ that could be competed with unlabeled _PROTEIN_ or gdp but not with unlabeled adp . the bovine g protein also showed _PROTEIN_ activity against bodipy _PROTEIN_ that was competed by unlabeled gdp or _PROTEIN_ but not by unlabeled adp . we then analyzed the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ proteins and human for _PROTEIN_ binding and hydrolysis . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ both show specific _PROTEIN_ binding that could be efficiently competed by _METHOD_ gdp or _PROTEIN_ but not by adp . confirming binding specificity both _PROTEIN_ proteins showed efficient binding with bodipy gdp which could be competed with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ but not with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . no binding with bodipy _PROTEIN_ or effect of _PROTEIN_ on bodipy _PROTEIN_ binding were observed . _PROTEIN_ binding was also independently confirmed by _PROTEIN_ binding assays . the _PROTEIN_ proteins also show _PROTEIN_ activity . we independently confirmed their _PROTEIN_ activity by assaying the production of free pi using the enzchek phosphate assay kit and by quantification of _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis using thin layer chromatography . the _PROTEIN_ activity of the two _PROTEIN_ proteins is mg dependent as the presence of mm edta abolished _PROTEIN_ activity and it has a broad ph optimum . recombinant human did not exhibit _PROTEIN_ binding or _PROTEIN_ activity under our assay conditions . together these assays firmly establish that the newly identified _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins have specific _PROTEIN_ binding and _PROTEIN_ activity hallmarks of signaling g proteins . to evaluate the in planta functions of the _PROTEIN_ we first analyzed their _PROTEIN_ patterns . quantitative pcr analysis showed widespread _PROTEIN_ of both _PROTEIN_ genes . these results were corroborated by gus reporter gene analysis . gus staining was observed in all plant organs analyzed cotyledons leaves _METHOD_ roots flowers and guard cells . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcript levels did not change after treatment with aba or different abiotic stresses . we pursued a reverse genetic approach to decipher _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ protein functions in planta . single t dna insertional mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were isolated for each gene . rt pcr using the primer combinations and which flank the insertion sites confirmed the absence of full length transcripts . the single mutants were used to generate the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . pcr with primer combinations and revealed that reduced levels of a truncated transcript could be detected for both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ upstream of the insertion . to confirm that phenotypes of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants are indeed due to _PROTEIN_ mutation the double mutant was complemented with full length _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ genes . for each gene complementation was performed with two types of constructs n or c terminal fusions with the _PROTEIN_ epitope tag . multiple transgenic lines were obtained for each construct and showed different levels of fusion protein _PROTEIN_ . for each gene two independent lines of each of n and c terminal _PROTEIN_ fusions one showing moderate _PROTEIN_ and the other showing higher _PROTEIN_ were analyzed . while the phenotypes of single gtg mutant plants were indistinguishable from wild type the double _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant exhibited significant differences related mostly to aba signaling both at early and adult stages . in all assays the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype could be fully complemented with introduction of either the _PROTEIN_ or the _PROTEIN_ genes implying redundancy in _PROTEIN_ function . no complementation was observed with the empty vector . complemented lines with either n or c terminal _PROTEIN_ epitope fusions showed similar results . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant showed hyposensitivity to aba in seed germination and post germination growth assays . on aba only about of the wild type wassilewskija seeds germinated whereas the germination percentage of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant seeds was . about germination was obtained with aba for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants an aba concentration at which no wild type seeds germinated . the effect of aba on post germination growth of seedlings was analyzed by scoring percentages of germinated seeds forming green cotyledons at aba . all _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings formed green cotyledons at this aba concentration whereas only about of ws or gtg single mutants developed green cotyledons . the same trend was obtained for inhibition of primary root length by aba . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants showed less sensitivity to aba with only inhibition in root length at aba a concentration sufficient to cause almost inhibition of root length in ws single _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutants and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant complemented with either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . aba induced gene _PROTEIN_ was also significantly compromised in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants as determined by quantification of the transcript levels of a number of aba induced marker genes . for aba induction of stomatal closure the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant plants were significantly aba hyposensitive exhibiting only a _PROTEIN_ in stomatal aperture as compared to an _PROTEIN_ in wild type plants however aba inhibition of stomatal opening remained similar to wild type . the adult _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant plants are smaller have a mildly stressed appearance and flower earlier than wild type plants . the endogenous aba level in the double mutant plants is comparable to that of wild type . we also analyzed the transcript levels of other reported aba receptors in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant to evaluate the possibility that the aba hyposensitive phenotypes are due to lower _PROTEIN_ of those receptors . no differences in transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ could be detected in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants as compared to wild type . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins were initially identified based on their similarity to an orphan _PROTEIN_ . one of the signature properties of _PROTEIN_ is their interaction with g proteins therefore we evaluated the interaction of _PROTEIN_ proteins with the sole canonical arabidopsis subunit _PROTEIN_ . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interacted with _PROTEIN_ in the split ubiquitin system designed to assess interaction of _LOCATION_ proteins . interaction of _PROTEIN_ cub with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ nub fusions was observed under very high stringency conditions . additional results and controls are presented in citation . we verified this interaction by coimmunoprecipitation . total microsomal or soluble fractions from wild type or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tagged _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ were immunoprecipitated with _PROTEIN_ antibodies and probed with _PROTEIN_ antibodies . the _PROTEIN_ protein could be detected in the total microsomal fractions but not in the soluble fractions nor in the immunoprecipitated proteins from wild type plants . since _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have g protein activity of their own we elucidated whether interaction with _PROTEIN_ affects the _PROTEIN_ binding and _PROTEIN_ activity of the _PROTEIN_ proteins . the _PROTEIN_ binding activity of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins is accelerated by _PROTEIN_ and remarkably their _PROTEIN_ activity is strongly inhibited . to confirm that the reduced total _PROTEIN_ activity is an effect of _PROTEIN_ on _PROTEIN_ activity and not vice versa we used a mutant form of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ predicted to have normal _PROTEIN_ binding but lack _PROTEIN_ activity due to the mutation of its conserved _PROTEIN_ domain . our assays with bodipy _PROTEIN_ and p _PROTEIN_ experimentally demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ indeed lacks _PROTEIN_ activity and therefore we designate it as constitutively active _PROTEIN_ . remarkably the presence of blocks the _PROTEIN_ activity of the _PROTEIN_ proteins confirming that the _PROTEIN_ bound form of _PROTEIN_ inhibits the _PROTEIN_ activity of _PROTEIN_ proteins . the g protein activity and _PROTEIN_ like topology of _PROTEIN_ proteins along with the significantly aba hyposensitive phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants led to the intriguing possibility that the _PROTEIN_ proteins constitute all or part of an unusual class of g protein coupled aba perception complex . to test this possibility we carried out direct aba binding assays with h aba and purified recombinant _PROTEIN_ proteins . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins showed saturable and specific h aba binding with apparent k d values of nm and nm respectively . _PROTEIN_ proteins did not bind h benzoic acid another weak acid used as a negative control . the aba binding of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ could be effectively competed with unlabeled biologically active aba but not by the biologically inactive aba isomer . following the implication that the _PROTEIN_ proteins do not bind the aba isomer the above k d values would then be halved . no h aba binding was observed when bsa or _PROTEIN_ was used as a control for nonspecific binding . _PROTEIN_ which like the _PROTEIN_ proteins is a predicted multitransmembrane domain protein was evaluated as a further control for nonspecific binding . in contrast to the _PROTEIN_ proteins _PROTEIN_ showed low levels of nonspecific aba binding . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ showed more efficient aba binding in the presence of gdp as compared to binding in the presence of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . the presence of _PROTEIN_ did not affect aba binding . _PROTEIN_ alone showed no aba binding . additionally the presence of edta which inhibits _PROTEIN_ activity of the _PROTEIN_ proteins also abolished aba binding consistent with the observation that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ proteins bind aba more weakly than gdp _PROTEIN_ proteins . heat denatured _PROTEIN_ proteins do not show aba binding . these results thus substantiate the specific aba binding by _PROTEIN_ proteins . the observed stoichiometry of binding is low in these experiments probably due to nonoptimal conditions of protein purification solubilization and renaturation . since the _PROTEIN_ and purification of _PROTEIN_ in heterologous _METHOD_ remains one of the biggest _PROTEIN_ in the field further experiments are needed to find the optimal system for _PROTEIN_ and purification of active _PROTEIN_ proteins . optimized conditions especially with respect to the lipid environment detergent concentration plus other renaturation conditions and posttranslational modifications will help in more accurate determination of the stoichiometry .
