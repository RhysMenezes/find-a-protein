eukaryotic _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ contact sites are evolutionarily conserved microdomains that have important roles in specialized metabolic functions such as _LOCATION_ pm communication lipid homeostasis and influx . despite recent advances in knowledge about _LOCATION_ pm contact site components and functions in yeast and mammals relatively little is known about the functional significance of these structures in plants . in this report we characterize the arabidopsis phospholipid binding _PROTEIN_ as a plant ortholog of the mammal extended synaptotagmins and yeast tricalbins families of _LOCATION_ pm anchors . we propose that _PROTEIN_ functions at _LOCATION_ pm contact sites because it displays a dual _LOCATION_ pm localization it is enriched in microtubule depleted regions at the cell cortex and it colocalizes with vesicle associated a known _LOCATION_ pm marker . furthermore biochemical and physiological analyses indicate that _PROTEIN_ might function as an electrostatic phospholipid anchor conferring mechanical stability in plant cells . together the subcellular localization and functional characterization of _PROTEIN_ highlights a putative role of plant _LOCATION_ pm contact site components in the cellular _PROTEIN_ to environmental stresses .
_PROTEIN_ contains a modular structure similar to _LOCATION_ pm tether proteins such as e syts and tricalbins proteins that are localized at specific _LOCATION_ pm subdomains . moreover cell biological and biochemical analyses have reported _PROTEIN_ being at the _LOCATION_ pm and plasmodesmata . to unequivocally establish the _PROTEIN_ subcellular localization we developed new polyclonal anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies _PROTEIN_ and demonstrated their specificity by the absence of signal in the null _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ via western blot and immunolocalization . next we performed immunolocalization analyses in transgenic arabidopsis lines _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ tagged _LOCATION_ retention peptide hdel _METHOD_ and the pm markers _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ brassinosteroid _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ intrinsic protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . as shown in figure the anti _PROTEIN_ perinuclear signal colocalized with hdel _METHOD_ confirming the broad _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ . interestingly at the cell cortex the anti _PROTEIN_ signal was characterized by a punctate pattern that was closely associated with hdel _METHOD_ but did not colocalize . remarkably in those cortical regions the anti _PROTEIN_ signal colocalized with pm markers _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ suggesting a dual _LOCATION_ pm localization . to analyze the _PROTEIN_ subcellular localization in leaf epidermal cells we generated transgenic arabidopsis lines _PROTEIN_ a c terminal translational fusion of _METHOD_ to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . at the cell cortex the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ marker appeared as a reticulate network of beads and strings that was clearly different from the classical network of sheets and interconnected tubules observed in the luminal _LOCATION_ marker hdel _METHOD_ and the _METHOD_ tagged _LOCATION_ associated _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ like _METHOD_ . at the equatorial plane the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ marker appeared as a punctuate signal at the cell periphery and signal movement through transvacuolar strands was observed . transient colocalization in nicotiana benthamiana of a red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ fused to its endogenous promoter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with the _LOCATION_ targeted yellow cameleon showed that the _PROTEIN_ signal was enriched at specific _LOCATION_ subdomains . a high resolution subcellular localization for _PROTEIN_ was obtained by immunogold transmission electron microscopy of high pressure frozen freeze substituted wild type roots probed with the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . similar to previous immunotem results the anti _PROTEIN_ signal was observed at both the _LOCATION_ and pm . however the use of more specific and sensitive antibodies together with the better structural preservation of the high pressure frozen samples enabled us to observe an enrichment of the anti _PROTEIN_ signal in regions where the cortical _LOCATION_ was in close apposition to the pm and between cortical microtubule bundles . since the _PROTEIN_ localization at the _LOCATION_ pm interface strongly resembled that of the recently reported arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ pm markers we next performed transient colocalization studies using the _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ fused to the ubiquitin promoter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ markers in n. benthamiana leaves . as shown in figure c and d the markers colocalized to a great extent in both intracellular and cortical regions of the cell . together these data strongly suggest that _PROTEIN_ is enriched at _LOCATION_ pm contact sites a feature shared with the e syts and tricalbins in animals and yeast respectively . once we determined that _PROTEIN_ populations with different subcellular localizations coexist in plant cells we analyzed the dynamics of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ using time lapse and _METHOD_ recovery after photobleaching assays . the time lapse experiments showed that the intracellular _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was highly dynamic and different _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localizations within the transvacuolar strands were detected on frames separated by s . in contrast the cortical _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was spatially restricted to largely stationary positions . frap analysis of the cortical _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals showed the recovery of of the signal was achieved in less than min . notably the recovered signal positions strongly resembled those marked by the prebleached _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ further supporting the nearly stationary nature of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ cortical sites . in actively dividing root epidermal cells the _PROTEIN_ signal transitioned from the _LOCATION_ to the mitotic spindle at metaphase and was delivered to the forming cell plate during cytokinesis . this result suggests that the spatial localization of _PROTEIN_ might be partially controlled by the microtubule _LOCATION_ . to further investigate this possible link we performed colocalization studies of _PROTEIN_ with different mt markers . in roots the anti _PROTEIN_ and the _METHOD_ tagged mammalian microtubule associated _METHOD_ signals were mutually exclusive indicating that the _PROTEIN_ puncta were _PROTEIN_ located within mt depleted regions . the same result was obtained when the anti _PROTEIN_ signal was compared with that generated by a monoclonal antibody that recognizes the tyrosinated form of the alpha tubulin subunit . in shoots we analyzed the _PROTEIN_ localization using a stable double transgenic line harboring the _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ markers . as shown in figure d and e both signals were largely separated with an estimated colocalization rate that ranged from to depending on the sample and microscopy settings used . finally we treated lines _PROTEIN_ the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ marker with _LOCATION_ depolymerizing drugs . as shown in figure f to h f actin depolymerization induced by latrunculin b abolished _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ cytoplasmic streaming and caused the aggregation of the intracellular/er _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ pool whereas the cortical pool remained mostly unaffected . interestingly oryzalin mediated mt depolymerization changed neither the intracellular _LOCATION_ nor the cortical _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ distributions in shoot epidermal cells but changes in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ distributions were observed in mature guard cells . these results suggest that once established the _LOCATION_ pm contact sites do not require the _LOCATION_ scaffold to _PROTEIN_ their position in leaf epidermal cells but this process might be differentially regulated in guard cells . similar to most tricalbins and e syts _PROTEIN_ contains a predicted tm domain and phospholipid binding _PROTEIN_ domains through which it could connect the _LOCATION_ to the pm in trans . to assess the accuracy of these predictions and to distinguish between the two possible _PROTEIN_ orientations _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ we first analyzed where isolated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domains were targeted . for this purpose we generated stable transgenic lines harboring the _PROTEIN_ peptide containing the _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domains _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fused to the promoter . we also used a _METHOD_ and the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines as controls . as shown in figure the _METHOD_ and the _METHOD_ markers were both partially targeted to the _LOCATION_ but whereas the _METHOD_ construct strongly labeled the _LOCATION_ the _METHOD_ construct was _PROTEIN_ targeted to the pm . this subcellular localization was further assessed by localization analysis of the different markers in plasmolyzed cells and colocalization studies with the endocytic tracer n { hexatrienyl } pyridinium dibromide that labels the pm in short term treatments . in all cases the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was different from the punctuated pm pattern observed for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ tm domain is anchored to the _LOCATION_ and the _PROTEIN_ domains tether the pm and the _PROTEIN_ tm and smp domains might restrict the positions where the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domains bind to the pm that is to regions where the _LOCATION_ is in close contact with the pm . in mammals the e syts _PROTEIN_ domains have been reported to bind phosphatidylinositol phosphates in both a dependent and independent manner . once we determined that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domains were targeted to the pm we aimed to identify phospholipid species that might be involved in the _PROTEIN_ pm tethering process . thus we performed in vitro protein lipid overlay assays using the purified _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ peptide in the presence or absence of . in the presence of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ peptide bound phosphatidylserine phosphatidic acid _PROTEIN_ lysophosphatidic acid and each of the negatively charged ptdinsps but not phosphatidylinositol . in the absence of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ strongly reduced the affinity for ps and slightly reduced the affinity for most of the ptdinsps species . together these results suggest that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ binding to pm localized ptdinsps is largely independent and largely relies on electrostatic interactions . previous reports have shown that _PROTEIN_ loss of function causes hypersensitivity to conditions that generate changes in cellular turgor such as osmotic ionic and freezing stresses . due to its subcellular localization and putative tethering function we hypothesized that _PROTEIN_ might function as a structural component required to withstand external and internal physicomechanical forces . to gain further insights into this putative role we determined whether the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ responds to mechanical damage using transgenic plants transformed with the reporter _PROTEIN_ gene driven by the _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ . as shown in figure the _PROTEIN_ signal was strongly induced by mechanical damage . next we analyzed the behavior of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ marker subjected to controlled pressure . as shown in figure the organized _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ reticulated structures developed into more defined _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ aggregates after s treatments . a similar behavior was observed when the hdel _METHOD_ marker was used suggesting that changes in _LOCATION_ morphology might represent an early response to mechanical stress . under similar conditions the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ marker partially depolymerized indicating that different cortical structures were quickly responding to mechanical stress cues . to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ has a functional role in mechanical stress responses we next analyzed the cellular stability of the _PROTEIN_ mutant upon mechanical stress . first we observed that _PROTEIN_ protoplasts displayed reduced tolerance to mechanical stress compared with the wild type suggesting that _PROTEIN_ has a role in mechanical stress _PROTEIN_ that is at least in part cell wall independent . in leaves the application of mechanical stress inhibited their expansion and caused more extensive tissue damage in _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type . the extent of the damage was further evaluated using trypan blue a vital stain that can not be excluded by dead cells . although trypan blue stain was limited to a few individual cells within the pressed area in the wild type the stain was observed in most cells either within or adjacent to the pressed area in _PROTEIN_ . this difference in damage was quantified by measuring electrolyte leakage of mechanically excised wild type and _PROTEIN_ leaf discs . figure shows that the normalized conductivity of the solution containing _PROTEIN_ leaf discs was approximately higher than that of the solution containing wild type discs . consistent with the observed mechanical stress hypersensitivity the application of heavy mechanical loads caused the collapse of of the wild type and of the _PROTEIN_ epidermal cells harboring the hdel _METHOD_ marker and of the wild type and of the _PROTEIN_ epidermal cells harboring the _METHOD_ marker . remarkably the application of light mechanical loads enhanced the depolymerization of the _METHOD_ marker in _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type indicating that this early mechanical response was also altered in the _PROTEIN_ background . despite the multiple phenotypes associated with _PROTEIN_ depletion no clear morphological differences at the cortical _LOCATION_ were observed between the wild type and _PROTEIN_ . this result suggests that _PROTEIN_ is important for _LOCATION_ pm function but additional components might be required for _LOCATION_ pm contact sites establishment .
