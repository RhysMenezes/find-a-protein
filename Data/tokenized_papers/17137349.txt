total soluble protein samples from purified mitochondrial samples were incubated with mg of _PROTEIN_ acrylamide gel _PROTEIN_ in binding buffer and following this a series of wash steps under high salt concentration removed the unbound protein samples by successive centrifugation of the resin removal of the supernatant and refreshing of the wash buffer . supernatants of samples treated in this fashion and separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are shown in figure with successive dilution of the protein content through each wash step . the binding and wash buffers contained mm amp mm adp and mm nadh to reduce binding of non _PROTEIN_ binding proteins to the resin during the binding and washing steps . finally the resin was resuspended in an elution buffer containing mm _PROTEIN_ . inclusion of _PROTEIN_ lead to displacement of substantial amounts of proteins from the resin that were visualized as a complex set of proteins by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . these proteins had a distinct banding pattern compared to the total soluble protein and the unbound/flow through samples . approximately of the protein initially incubated with the resin was collected in the _PROTEIN_ eluted sample . to determine if adp amp and nadh were displacing specific proteins during the binding and elution phase we conducted a series of experiments without these reagents in the wash buffer . samples were bound to _PROTEIN_ acrylamide and washed three times in the absence of any nucleotides . after this third wash the supernatants were concentrated and separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to reveal low levels of proteins in the wash solutions . addition of mm nadh amp or adp to samples respectively yielded only a low amount and a small number of protein bands in the supernatants after incubation and centrifugation . the sample with adp provides the only pattern distinct from the wash steps with two bands above the kda marker and a prominent band at kda and weaker bands at and kda _METHOD_ . in contrast mm _PROTEIN_ elution from sample d yielded an abundant complex sample . sample e was treated as figure with mm nadh amp and adp present in all the binding and wash steps and final elution with _PROTEIN_ . no significant difference was seen in the banding patterns between the final samples in d and e on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gels . with samples prepared in the manner shown in figure lane e a series of regions from a _METHOD_ stained gel were cut from polyacrylamide _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gel separations . these were in gel digested with trypsin and prepared for _METHOD_ analysis . in addition a different phosphate tethered media was tested based on a mer flexible linker to sepharose . _PROTEIN_ displacement of proteins from the mer linker acrylamide and mer linker sepharose media were compared on polyacrylamide gradient gels to maximize the separation of proteins in the complex region noted between and kda seen in figure . a broad degree of similarity in the protein banding pattern was observed when _PROTEIN_ eluates from the two media were compared . but there were several differences around the and kda marker points as well as differences in the abundance of specific protein bands . a selection of protein regions from the gel of the _PROTEIN_ samples and protein regions from the gel of the _PROTEIN_ samples were excised and digested in gel with trypsin and prepared for _METHOD_ analysis . to further explore the complex nature of the _PROTEIN_ eluate fractions ief/sds _PROTEIN_ gels were performed to compare of total soluble protein sample before affinity chromatography with of _PROTEIN_ bound fraction protein . spot abundance was compared between gels to locate proteins that were differentially abundant in the _PROTEIN_ eluted sample and proteins that were near equally abundant in both samples . this process was repeated five times on separate gels from independent _PROTEIN_ elutions from different mitochondrial preparations . in total spots were selected from single spot excision and in gel digestion followed by _METHOD_ from selected gels in spots proteins were identified with confidence . of these proteins were highly enriched in the _PROTEIN_ eluted sample and were abundant proteins in the _PROTEIN_ eluted samples but were in overlapping positions with major proteins in the total soluble proteome . the functional significance of these two groups is explored in more detail below . because of the very different protein patterns on the soluble and _PROTEIN_ eluate gels it was not possible to use standard gel comparison tools that rely on largely similar protein patterns with a small number of changes . instead manual matching was performed and spots were assigned to the two groups based on abundance being > fold higher in the _PROTEIN_ eluate compared to total soluble protein . this was defined as greater than near equal abundance when of total protein was compared to of _PROTEIN_ purified protein . some of these proteins were greater than fold higher in abundance in the _PROTEIN_ eluate gels . the remainder were abundant in the _PROTEIN_ eluate but also present in the total soluble protein set at equal or greater amounts . more minor spots on the _PROTEIN_ eluted gels that overlapped with major regions of abundant protein in the soluble protein gels were not analyzed . table contains the _METHOD_ identifications of proteins enriched on gels and shows the presence or absence of these same proteins in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ gel analyses . of the proteins in this group were identified using both media on gels and were enriched on the separations while the remainder were found in at least one of the gel separations and the gel separations . these identified proteins represent a distinct set of functional categories including a high proportion of heat shock proteins . only of the had been previously found on gel based separations and analysis of mitochondrial proteins from arabidopsis while a further had been found in the proteome but only in nongel complex mixture _METHOD_ analysis . a final were new identifications not previously made by proteomic analysis of mitochondria . the previously found only by _METHOD_ include rna binding proteins the lon protease and several biogenesis proteins all low abundance proteins that have been selectively enriched by the affinity chromatography . remarkably in some cases these were abundant _METHOD_ stained protein spots in of protein of the _PROTEIN_ eluate samples . of the new identifications two notable ones have previously been claimed to be arabidopsis mitochondrial proteins on the basis of _METHOD_ fusion _PROTEIN_ and co localization with mitochondria in vivo . these are an rrm containing rna binding protein citation and a glycolate dehydrogenase .citation the identification of an unknown protein marks the first time this has been found in plant mitochondria . it has not been reported to have been identified in any other _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis in arabidopsis . bioinformatic analysis shows it is predicted to localize to the mitochondria by several subcellular prediction _METHOD_ including predotar targetp and ipsort . it contains esterase and hydrolyase interpro domains but it is not closely related to a known function protein . it is only known from three ests making it the product of a rare transcript in arabidopsis . table contains the _METHOD_ identifications of major proteins found on gels that eluted off _PROTEIN_ affinity media by _PROTEIN_ but also appear to be significantly abundant proteins in the soluble proteome . placement of proteins in table versus table was determined by both their comigration with major proteins in figure and their known abundance from previous proteome the presence or absence of these same proteins in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ gel analyses are also shown . of the proteins in this group all are previously known from _METHOD_ studies of mitochondria . further _PROTEIN_ are found that complete the set of mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ found in table . spot from figure could not be identified with significant matches and is not included in table .
