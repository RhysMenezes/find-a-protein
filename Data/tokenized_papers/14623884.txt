the s proteasome is a multisubunit protease complex responsible for degrading a wide range of intracelular proteins in eukaryotes especially those modified with polyubiquitin chains . it is composed of a self compartmentalized core protease that houses the peptidase active sites appended on either or both ends by a regulatory particle that identifies appropriate substrates and translocates them into the lumen of the cp for breakdown . here we describe the molecular and biochemical properties of the s proteasome from the plant arabidopsis thaliana . like the cp and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of the rp the rp non _PROTEIN_ subunits are often encoded by two transcriptionally active genes with some pairs displaying sufficient sequence divergence to suggest functional differences . most rpn subunits could functionally replace their yeast counterparts implying that they have retained their positions and activities within the complex . a method was developed to purify the s proteasome intact from whole arabidopsis seedlings . these preparations are biochemically indistinguishable from those from yeast and mammals including the need for _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ integrity and a strong sensitivity to the inhibitors lactacystin and epoxomicin . _METHOD_ spectrometric analysis of the complex detected the presence of almost all cp and rp subunits . in many cases both products of paralogous genes were detected demonstrating that each isoform assembles into the mature particle . as with the yeast and animal s proteasomes attenuation of individual rp genes induces a coordinated up regulation of many of the other s proteasome genes suggesting that plants contain a negative feedback mechanism to regulate the s proteasome levels . the incorporation of paralogous subunits into the arabidopsis holoprotease raises the intriguing possibility that plants synthesize multiple s proteasome types with unique properties and/or target specificities .
characterization of the arabidopsis rpn we described the sequences and organization of the arabidopsis gene families encoding the cp the rpt _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ subunits . by reiterative blast searches using the yeast to to and genes as queries we identified here the remaining rpn genes in the near complete arabidopsis genomic sequence . the intron/exon boundaries and coding regions were compiled from genomic loci full length and partial cdnas and ests in the a. thaliana ecotype col data base . with the exception of full length cdnas are available for all loci . previously we were unable to detect _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ either by rna gel blotting or reverse transcriptase pcr of whole seedling total rna and thus considered this locus to be a pseudogene . however in this study we were able to pcr amplify a full length _PROTEIN_ cdna that matched the proposed organization from an arabidopsis cdna library indicating that this gene is transcriptionally active . single arabidopsis genes were detected for _PROTEIN_ and . two paralogous genes with nucleotide sequence identity were evident for to and . where available the cdna sequences matched exactly the predicted exons for the annotated genomic sequences in the col ecotype with the exception of _PROTEIN_ and . in both genes a bp mismatch was detected that could reflect a sequencing _LOCATION_ or a polymorphic allele . none of the rpn cdnas were sequence variants that would imply alternative splicing . as predicted from the recent origin of many duplicated genes in arabidopsis the genomic organizations of paralogous rpn genes are highly similar . the major exception is _PROTEIN_ and b. alignments of the cdna and genomic sequences confirmed the prediction that the _PROTEIN_ locus is missing a substantial portion of the end and the last intron and is predicted to _PROTEIN_ a truncated protein missing the first amino acids . and b also differ from each other by the presence of an additional intron in the middle of . comparisons of the derived amino acid sequences showed that the arabidopsis rpn subunits are highly related both in sequence and structure to their expected orthologs from other eukaryotic _METHOD_ with percentage identities/similarities ranging from to . the most conserved subunits among the plant fungal and animal _METHOD_ are and _PROTEIN_ and the most diverged subunits are and _PROTEIN_ . each of the arabidopsis subunits also contains the signature motif present in their nonplant orthologs . for example and _PROTEIN_ n terminal domains were detected in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ domains in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and and proteasome/cyclosome repeats in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . for the jamm metalloprotease motif is present within the _PROTEIN_ domain and includes the positional conserved histidine residues that comprise the active site . previous yeast two hybrid analyses revealed that yeast and pairs interact strongly with each other in the rp using their respective _PROTEIN_ and and _PROTEIN_ n terminal domains for contacts . yeast two hybrid analysis of the arabidopsis counterparts demonstrated that these interactions are conserved in plants . the _PROTEIN_ and pairs appended to the activation and binding domains showed positive yeast two hybrid analysis interactions using both the and lacz reporter activities as the assays . confirmation that the arabidopsis rpn subunits are functionally orthologous to their yeast counterparts was provided by complementation of rpn deficient yeast strains . for most of the essential yeast rpn genes growth of the corresponding strain could be partially or fully restored by introducing the wild type yeast gene _PROTEIN_ from a high copy plasmid . similar rescue was evident for arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and but not for and . we previously showed that a yeast deletion strain missing the nonessential subunit _PROTEIN_ gene could be complemented with arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ . here we extended this observation to the other nonessential subunit gene . the strain is viable at but fails to grow at . as can be seen in fig . introducing yeast or either one of the two arabidopsis _METHOD_ rescued this high temperature growth defect . purification of the arabidopsis s define the activity and subunit composition of the s proteasome from plants and to determine whether the complex can incorporate either paralog of the cp and rp subunits we developed a method to purify the s proteasome intact from whole arabidopsis seedlings and analyzed it biochemically . to help stabilize the holoprotease and minimize proteolysis after extraction all buffers included mm _PROTEIN_ and a mixture of protease inhibitors . enrichment at each step was followed by the sensitive cleavage of the substrate suc llvy amc which is diagnostic for the chymotrypsin like activity of the cp and by immunoblot analyses with antibodies against representative subunits of the cp _PROTEIN_ and rp base _PROTEIN_ and lid _PROTEIN_ to ensure that each of the subparticles remained associated during the purification . young seedlings grown for days in liquid culture proved to be the best source having a high peptidase activity and containing less starch and polyphenols that often interfere with plant protein isolation . approximately of the peptidase activity in crude extracts was resistant to indicating that a variety of other peptidases were present initially . although the peg precipitation step provided only a modest increase in s proteasome purity it did remove a majority of these contaminating activities and thus may have helped _PROTEIN_ the integrity of the complex . purification of the s complex to near homogeneity was ultimately achieved by sequential anion exchange with a uno column and size exclusion chromatography with a superose column . during the size exclusion step the complex eluted as a single peak as judged by the peptidase activity profile and by the immunoblot analysis with cp base and lid subunit antibodies . the peptidase activity was strongly inhibited by and was sensitive to _PROTEIN_ both attributes of the s proteasome from yeast and animals . we typically obtained a fold purification with a overall yield . approximately of s proteasome were isolated from g fresh weight of seedlings . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ analysis of the superose fractions revealed a distribution of polypeptides similar to that for the s proteasome purified from spinach rice and nonplant sources including groupings at and kda and a few minor proteins around kda . one significant contaminant was a doublet of and kda polypeptides that eluted earlier as a particle much larger than the s proteasome . _METHOD_ analysis identified this protein as the arabidopsis ortholog of tripeptidyl peptidase _PROTEIN_ ii . analysis of the proteasome preparation by native _PROTEIN_ demonstrated that it contained both the cp and rp and that their association required _PROTEIN_ . as can be seen in fig . when the complex was electrophoresed in the presence of mm _PROTEIN_ and mm two species were detected by an in gel peptidase assay with suc llvy amc and by immunoblotting with the cp _PROTEIN_ rp base _PROTEIN_ and rp lid _PROTEIN_ specific antibodies . the larger form probably represented the cp capped with two rps and the smaller form represented the cp capped with a single rp . consistent with this notion analysis of superose fractions across the peak of peptidase activity showed that the larger form eluted earlier . some free cp could be seen with the anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies but not by the peptidase activity suggesting that only a small portion of cp was present in the free form . in the absence of _PROTEIN_ and both s species dissociated thus generating a large pool of free cp _PROTEIN_ antibodies and free rp _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with only a residual amount remaining in the two s _METHOD_ . this dissociation also occurred in the presence of the nonhydrolyzable _PROTEIN_ analog amp _PROTEIN_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis is required for cp/rp binding . further _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ resolution of the dissociated s complex revealed the characteristic subunit patterns of the cp and rp subcomplexes . the peptidase activity of the dissociated cp could be activated severalfold upon the addition of _PROTEIN_ to the gel consistent with the reported ability of this detergent to activate this subcomplex at low concentrations . inhibitor studies of the arabidopsis s lactacystin and epoxomicin are effective inhibitors of the yeast and animal s proteasomes . despite their use in many studies on plant protein breakdown these inhibitors have not yet been confirmed to be highly effective with the plant particle . to demonstrate the efficacy of these inhibitors we tested their ability to block the purified arabidopsis s proteasome using the suc llvy amc peptidase assay . the calculated km for this substrate in the presence of _PROTEIN_ is in agreement with the s proteasome preparations from nonplant sources . as can be seen in fig . all four inhibitors effectively quenched the activity of the purified arabidopsis s proteasome at nanomolar concentrations . and are competitive inhibitors and effectively blocked activity with a ki of and nm respectively . lactacystin and epoxomicin which covalently modify the active site threonines and thus are irreversible inhibitors inhibited of the activity with as little as and nm respectively . appeared to be the most potent in blocking even residual chymotryptic activity with > of the activity inhibited with . although effective with the purified complex all four inhibitors only marginally block the peptidase activity in crude seedling extracts indicating that other suc llvy amc degrading peptidases are present . most of these contaminating activities were removed by the peg precipitation step . it is also possible that a portion of the inhibited activity is derived from other proteases that are also sensitive to these compounds . subunit composition of the arabidopsis s the presence of paralogous genes for many cp and rp subunits raised the intriguing possibility that both members of each pair assemble into a holoprotease particle thus creating an array of s proteasome types in arabidopsis . to confirm the core subunit organization of the arabidopsis s proteasome and determine whether each isoform can be incorporated we analyzed by _METHOD_ the subunit composition of the particle purified from whole seedlings . here the preparation was subjected to one and two dimensional _PROTEIN_ and individual protein bands/spots were treated in gel with trypsin followed by maldi tof _METHOD_ . the origin of the peptides was then deduced by matching this _METHOD_ fingerprint with that predicted from the arabidopsis proteomic data base . consistent with the expected organization of the holoprotease we detected signature peptides derived from almost all of the predicted rpt and rpn subunits including both _METHOD_ . in most cases at least seven peptides covering > of the polypeptides were detected for each band or spot that matched exactly the predicted peptide _METHOD_ fingerprint of the corresponding protein . for _PROTEIN_ alone we detected peptides from the more acidic species that covered of the protein . in yeast and animals the and subunits are processed at the n terminus to expose a positionally conserved threonine that _METHOD_ part of the active site . maldi tof _METHOD_ analysis of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ indicated that a similar processing occurs in plants at least for this subunit . we detected a tryptic fragment of m/z that matches exactly a predicted peptide beginning at this threonine followed by additional residues ending in an arginine . for many subunits encoded by two genes peptides were identified that covered the same region but allowed unambiguous identification . for example isoform specific peptides derived from the same region were observed for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . by the same method paralogs of other subunits were easily identified in the final s proteasome preparation including most of the duplicated subunits of the and rpt _PROTEIN_ and many duplicated rpn subunits of the rp . for several paralogs with distinct two dimensional _PROTEIN_ map positions protein staining allowed us to conclude that the relative abundance of each isoform was similar _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . despite this success several expected subunits were not identified by in gel tryptic digestion coupled with maldi tof _METHOD_ including _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . several protein spots on the two dimensional gels repeatedly failed to generate _METHOD_ identifiable peptides it is possible that these spots correspond to some of these missing subunits . for several subunits detected by _METHOD_ it was not possible to distinguish between the a and b paralogs _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or unambiguously identify one of the paralogs _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . most cp and rp subunits were easily detected in the one dimensional gels by maldi tof _METHOD_ . however the more complex electrophoretic pattern of the two dimensional gels indicated that many s proteasome subunits are even more heterogeneous than genome analysis would predict . in several cases these subunits appeared as a complex string of species possibly reflecting post translational modifications and/or posthomogenization proteolysis of the polypeptide . as examples two abundant protein species were detected for the subunit although this polypeptide is encoded by a single _PROTEIN_ gene the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pairs were detected by a series of species of similar apparent molecular _METHOD_ but distinct pis and several species with distinct pis and apparent _METHOD_ were detected for the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ pairs . for _PROTEIN_ we note that a second related locus is evident in the nearly complete arabidopsis genomic sequence that has been incorrectly assigned to the end of the gene . however this sequence contains an inframe stop codon and does not appear to be _PROTEIN_ and thus is likely to be a pseudogene . remarkably nearly complete _METHOD_ analysis of the one and two dimensional gels revealed only two proteins not predicted to exist within the core s proteasome complex suggesting that the organization of the plant s proteasome is highly similar to those from other eukaryotic _METHOD_ . one protein detected as a kda doublet during one dimensional _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ represents the arabidopsis ortholog of the drosophila protease _PROTEIN_ ii . this subtilisin like serine peptidase assembles into a homo oligomeric superstructure of mda and probably co purified with the s proteasome based on its similarly large size . the other kda polypeptide is related by sequence to fatty acid dioxygenase _PROTEIN_ that catalyzes the conversion of linolenic acid and other fatty acids into their hydroperoxy derivatives and is involved in oxidative stress responses and cell death . why this protein co purified with the s proteasome is unclear . close examination of the uno and profiles suggested that the elution patterns of _PROTEIN_ were distinct from those of the s proteasome and thus not likely to be associated with the protease . to examine further the heterogeneity within the arabidopsis s proteasome we subjected the two dimensional _PROTEIN_ gels to immunoblot analysis with antibodies against arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . one _PROTEIN_ protein and two _PROTEIN_ proteins were detected in accord with the single _PROTEIN_ gene and the two _PROTEIN_ genes respectively in the arabidopsis genome . similar to the _METHOD_ analysis two _PROTEIN_ species were detected although genomic analysis identified only a single intact _PROTEIN_ gene . for _PROTEIN_ a single species was detected in agreement with the presence of only a single gene that would encode this size protein . we failed to detect a polypeptide consistent with the size of _PROTEIN_ suggesting that it is either present at undetectable levels not _PROTEIN_ in young arabidopsis seedlings or not detected by the anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies . for _PROTEIN_ and b a string of proteins of similar size but different pi values was evident suggesting that either or both _METHOD_ of this subunit are post translationally modified . the most complicated two dimensional _PROTEIN_ pattern was that for _PROTEIN_ . although this subunit was not identified by the _METHOD_ analyses we easily detected the protein with anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies . however the protein was observed as a complex set of polypeptides ranging in size from more acidic kda species to more basic kda species . given that a single major _PROTEIN_ protein of kda can be observed in crude arabidopsis extracts homogenized under conditions that preclude posthomogenization proteolysis it was probable that the complex set seen in the purified s proteasome preparations reflected partial breakdown products . to test this possibility we analyzed samples from various stages of s proteasome purification with anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies . as can be seen in fig . _PROTEIN_ became progressively more degraded during the purification even with the inclusion of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and a mixture of other protease inhibitors to the extraction buffer . the increasingly more basic nature of the degradation products is consistent with the loss occurring progressively from the more acidic c terminal end containing the uim . _PROTEIN_ of arabidopsis rpn incorporation of paralogous cp and rp subunits could reflect a mechanism to create cell and tissue specific _METHOD_ of the s proteasome by differential _PROTEIN_ of the corresponding genes . to test this scenario we examined the _PROTEIN_ patterns of the rpn genes including both paralogs when available by rna gel blot analysis . mrnas for all rpn genes were evident in the arabidopsis est data bases or could be isolated from various cdna libraries indicating that all of the loci are transcriptionally active . with the exception of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrnas for all of the corresponding rpn loci also could be detected by rna gel blots . similar but not identical patterns were evident _PROTEIN_ of the rpn gene tested with the highest _PROTEIN_ typically seen in flowers . flowers also contained a high level of the encoding _PROTEIN_ mrna suggesting that the s proteasome pathway is generally more active in this reproductive tissue . more subtle differences were evident when comparing mrnas from roots and leaves with some genes showing a stronger root _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and others showing a stronger leaf _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . for the paralogous rpn loci similar qualitative patterns of _PROTEIN_ were observed . although the band intensities were typically weaker for the b paralogs their mrnas abundances in different tissues roughly paralleled those for the a paralogs . immunoblot analysis with antibodies against _PROTEIN_ and indicated that the levels of the corresponding proteins roughly matched their mrna abundance with flowers containing the highest levels of each subunit . self regulation of s proteasome synthesis in studies have noted an up regulation of various s proteasome subunit genes in actively dividing plant tissues and in response to stress suggesting that plants like yeast drosophila and mammals contain a mechanism to increase levels of the protease to meet demand . in yeast this up regulation is directed by a transcription _PROTEIN_ that activates the _PROTEIN_ of most if not all s proteasome subunit genes through a negative feedback control of its half life . although an obvious ortholog of is not evident in plants rna gel blot analysis of a battery of arabidopsis s proteasome genes in mutants affecting the base subunit _PROTEIN_ and the lid subunit _PROTEIN_ indicates that a similar regulation exists in plants . both the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines were generated by exon trap mutagenesis . they synthesize diminished levels of either truncated _PROTEIN_ or full length _PROTEIN_ versions as n terminal fusions to neomycin phosphotransferase but the chimeric proteins can still integrate into the s particle . the plants accumulate the s holoprotease to nearly normal levels but display either an abscisic acid hypersensitivity _PROTEIN_ or a _PROTEIN_ cytokinin sensitivity _PROTEIN_ presumably by selective attenuation of rp function . as shown in fig . mrnas for representative arabidopsis s proteasome subunit genes increased in the homozygous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ backgrounds as compared with wild type . this collection included transcripts encoding cp _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and rp base _PROTEIN_ and lid _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ subunits indicating that mrna abundance for all three subcomplexes were up regulated . immunoblot analyses with subunit antibodies revealed that this increase in mrnas is reflected at the protein level but only for the cp and rp base . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants accumulated more cp as judged by increases in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins and more rp base as judged by increases in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and . conversely no increase was evident for subunits of the rp lid including _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ although the abundance of the corresponding mrnas was expected to increase . this lack of effect suggests that mutant _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins may inhibit lid accumulation by blocking its assembly . it has been proposed that the csn could substitute for the rp lid in some _METHOD_ possibly as a mechanism to increase the functions and specificity of the s proteasome . immunoblot analysis with the _PROTEIN_ and subunits showed that the levels of these polypeptides were unaffected in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ backgrounds suggesting that the csn complex is not up regulated when the rp lid is impaired .
