in higher plants an outer layer of meristematic cells the protoderm _METHOD_ early in embryogenesis and this layer gives rise to the epidermis in differentiating tissues . we proposed previously that an arabidopsis thaliana homolog of _PROTEIN_ a gene for a receptor like protein kinase would be involved in differentiation and/or _PROTEIN_ of epidermis related tissues . in the present study we isolated loss of function _PROTEIN_ mutants by a reverse genetic approach . our extensive analyses using the transmission electron microscopy and the toluidine blue test a method that has recently been developed for the rapid visualization of defects in the leaf cuticle showed that the _PROTEIN_ mutations significantly affected the differentiation of leaf epidermal cells suggesting similar roles for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the differentiation of leaf epidermis . our _PROTEIN_ mutants also had various abnormalities related to epidermal differentiation which included disorganized cell layers in the integument and endothelium of ovules . in addition the green _METHOD_ protein fused to _PROTEIN_ was localized preferentially on the _PROTEIN_ and basal _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in the epidermis of the leaf primordia suggesting a role for _PROTEIN_ in epidermal differentiation at cell surfaces that make contact with adjacent cells . furthermore the loss of function mutations in the _PROTEIN_ and abnormal _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ genes which encode a putative subtilisin like serine protease synergistically affected the function of the epidermis such that most leaves fused . thus _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to play an essential role in the differentiation of proper epidermal cells in both vegetative and reproductive tissues .
