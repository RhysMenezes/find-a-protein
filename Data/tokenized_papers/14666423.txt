the arabidopsis thaliana heyhn . genome contains genes that show substantial sequence similarity to the tobacco gene and the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ gene . of these the nine _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ that bear the highest identity to were selected and their _PROTEIN_ in various situations was examined . we found that _PROTEIN_ behaves like the tobacco gene in that its transcripts are abundant in senescing leaves and they specifically accumulate during the hypersensitive response caused by exposure to an avirulent cucumber mosaic virus strain . spermine a novel inducer of tobacco pr genes was found to up regulate _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . green _METHOD_ protein fusion experiments indicated that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and possibly _PROTEIN_ are localized in the chloroplasts . studies using arabidopsis mutants defective in salicylic acid ethylene and jasmonic acid signalling revealed that the senescence associated _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is mediated by a pathway that involves sa but that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ during cmv induced hr and spermine treatment is totally independent of sa .
has been isolated as a gene that is up regulated by bacterial harpins and by bacteria that elicit the hr in tobacco . upon the completion of the arabidopsis genome sequencing it was found that a. thaliana possesses like genes including _PROTEIN_ . these proteins share three conserved motif sequences and have one or two putative transmembrane domains . these motifs are unique to this family of proteins . two of these motifs are particularly well conserved . based on the phylogenic tree resulting from comparing the arabidopsis nhl proteins with tobacco this gene family can be categorized into four classes . class is further divided into two subclasses . we selected ten members of this family for analysis of their _PROTEIN_ . five _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ occur in the same subclass to which belongs . four _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ belong to the second subclass of class . _PROTEIN_ which is required for arabidopsis resistance to certain pathogens was also included in the analysis . _PROTEIN_ is on chromosome and to _PROTEIN_ are clustered together on chromosome . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are also clustered together and are found on chromosome as is _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are on chromosomes and respectively . the steady state organ specific mrna levels of the ten nhl members were determined by northern analysis of eight different organs taken from healthy arabidopsis col plants . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts appear to be rather abundant and are present in all organs except flowers . _PROTEIN_ transcripts are present in most of the tissues albeit at lower levels than seen with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . these observations are in agreement with those of et al . . _PROTEIN_ transcripts were observed to accumulate strongly in senescing rosette leaves . these transcripts are also present at lower levels in roots young rosette leaves cauline leaves and siliques but are barely detectable in _METHOD_ and flowers . this _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ is consistent with that reported in a previous publication in which _PROTEIN_ is named _PROTEIN_ . thus our observations confirm that _PROTEIN_ is a useful molecular marker for leaf senescence in arabidopsis . transcripts of _PROTEIN_ are present in all leaves _METHOD_ and flowers but only at very low levels in siliques and roots . _PROTEIN_ transcripts are present in roots all leaves and _METHOD_ under physiological conditions but not in flower organs . no signals for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts were detected in any of the organs tested . hr has been observed when the a. thaliana ecotype _PROTEIN_ is inoculated with the cmv y strain . in contrast the virulent strain cmv _PROTEIN_ overcomes the defenses of a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ . we used this system and northern blotting to examine the effect of cmv inoculation on the _PROTEIN_ of the ten nhl members . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were responsive in _PROTEIN_ plants inoculated with both the cmv y and the cmv _PROTEIN_ strains . the steady state mrna levels of _PROTEIN_ increased up to ca . fold after inoculation of the cmv y strain . it has been noted before that _PROTEIN_ transcription is up regulated during infection with both virulent and avirulent bacteria . in contrast _PROTEIN_ transcription is highly up regulated in cmv y inoculated plants but not in cmv _PROTEIN_ inoculated plants . interestingly _PROTEIN_ transcripts behaved similarly to those of _PROTEIN_ . time course northern analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ transcripts accumulated h after inoculation at which point necrotic local lesions began to appear . thus similar to tobacco _PROTEIN_ is specifically up regulated in only an incompatible plant viral pathogen interaction . up regulation of the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is not detected with the inoculation of either virus . application of spm to tobacco induces the production of acidic pr proteins and renders the plant resistant to tmv infection . based on these observations we postulated that spm may be a defense signalling molecule and is thus involved in a plant defense response . we then found by screening with a differential display method that the tobacco gene is one of the spm responsive genes in this plant . the nhl genes of arabidopsis resemble and thus we investigated the effect of several polyamines and their biosynthetic precursors on the _PROTEIN_ of the ten nhl genes . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were specifically up regulated by spm which is similar to _PROTEIN_ while _PROTEIN_ was down regulated . _PROTEIN_ transcription was slightly up regulated by spm . like _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were down regulated by spermidine . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were unaffected by any of the chemicals . among the three spm responsive genes _PROTEIN_ was further investigated . time course analysis reveals that _PROTEIN_ transcripts start to accumulate h after treatment with mm spm . dose dependent effects of spm on _PROTEIN_ transcription were observed in the range of to mm with saturation at mm . the amino acid sequences of the ten nhl proteins including _PROTEIN_ were subjected to psort analysis . this analysis predicted that the n terminal regions of these proteins carry putative signal peptides that direct them to _LOCATION_ and/or mitochondria . to investigate the cellular localization of these proteins we made _METHOD_ fusion constructs of five of the ten nhl proteins being investigated in this study . thus the entire coding regions of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins were fused in frame with the open reading frame of _METHOD_ and these constructs were introduced into vicia faba leaves by particle bombardment . as a control for chloroplast localization the leaves were bombarded with _METHOD_ . the mitochondrial localization control _METHOD_ was a _METHOD_ fusion construct of the transit peptide from the arabidopsis mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ subunit . _METHOD_ is a basal vector that lacks any organellar targeting signals . these controls showed appropriate localization of green _METHOD_ signals as the guard cells in the leaves bombarded with _METHOD_ had signals in the whole cytoplasm while the _METHOD_ and mt _METHOD_ bombarded guard cells showed signals in the chloroplasts and the mitochondria respectively . the signals in the cells receiving _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were found exclusively in the chloroplasts . this was confirmed by merging these images with those of the _METHOD_ of chloroplasts . similarly chloroplast localization of _PROTEIN_ is highly possible . the organs emitting green _METHOD_ in _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ bombarded cells differ from those of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . to assign what they are further work is required . it is likely that the different nhl family members are not located in the same organelles . et and ja are known as senescence promoting phytohormones and sa has been identified as a signalling molecule that controls gene _PROTEIN_ in senescing leaves . furthermore it is known that these three compounds also play important roles in the defensive response to pathogen attack . these _PROTEIN_ prompted us to examine _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in several sa et and ja signalling defective mutants namely the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ nahg and _PROTEIN_ mutant arabidopsis plants . the first four plants are on the col background while the latter two are on the no background . we first assessed the senescence associated _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in these mutants by loading the same amount of total rna in each lane . we confirmed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is associated with natural leaf senescence in the two background ecotypes col and no . however this age dependent induction was considerably reduced in the nahg and _PROTEIN_ mutants and partially inhibited in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . these three mutants show a defect in sa signalling . in the et signalling defective _PROTEIN_ plants _PROTEIN_ transcript accumulation in aged leaves was also partly repressed . in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ transcripts were detected at lower levels in young leaves but the _PROTEIN_ transcript level in the senescing leaves was unimpaired compared with that of the wild type plants . these observations suggest that sa is involved in senescence associated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but ja is not and that whether et is participating in the process is uncertain . the a. thaliana ecotype _PROTEIN_ displays an hr upon cmv y inoculation and the causal r gene was mapped cloned and identified as _PROTEIN_ . sa et and ja signalling mutants carrying this r gene were inoculated with cmv y or cmv _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was investigated by northern analysis . the hr specific _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the six mutant plants was not affected . this result indicates that the enhanced _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ during this hr is independent of the sa et and ja signalling pathways . as shown in fig . spm treatment of arabidopsis induces _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we investigated whether sa et or ja is involved in the response of _PROTEIN_ to spm by using the sa et and ja signalling defective plants . figure clearly shows that the _PROTEIN_ profiles of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ nahg and _PROTEIN_ treated with spm were almost identical to those of the wild types suggesting that the response is independent of sa . spm induced _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was also not affected at all in the et signalling _PROTEIN_ and ja signalling _PROTEIN_ mutants . thus it appears that the response of _PROTEIN_ to spm is mediated through sa et and ja independent pathways . in coil plants the _PROTEIN_ transcripts accumulated even without any elicitor treatment . the level of sa in these mutants is likely to be elevated by wounding . in this context it should also be noted that in the mutants a hyperactivation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and an accumulation of sa were observed after an attack by bacterial pathogens .
the arabidopsis thaliana heyhn . ecotypes colombia _PROTEIN_ and were provided by the arabidopsis biological resource center _PROTEIN_ at the ohio state university and used as wild type plants . their derivatives were also used in this study . these include the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants which are on the col background and the nahg and _PROTEIN_ mutants which are on the no background . arabidopsis plants were grown on vermiculite in the greenhouse at under a h h dark regime . vicia faba l. seeds were _PROTEIN_ from the sakata seed co. japan and fully expanded leaves were used for particle bombardment . a. thaliana ecotype _PROTEIN_ and the mutant derivates were grown as described above . their fully expanded leaves were rub inoculated with of cmv y or an indonesian isolate of cmv _PROTEIN_ as described by takahashi et al . . chemicals of an analytical grade were applied to detached young rosette leaves floating on murashige and skoog _METHOD_ media . the leaves were incubated for the indicated periods at under continuous light . polyamines and their biosynthetic precursors were added at unless otherwise indicated . total rnas isolated by the _PROTEIN_ method were size separated on formaldehyde agarose gels and transferred to a nylon _LOCATION_ . the blots were hybridized with gene specific probes that had been labelled with the dig dna labeling kit . in the cases of _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the untranslated regions were used whereas in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the utr regions were used . for _PROTEIN_ the region encoding the c distal half of the gene s product was used as the probe . among those probes the highest identity was scored between those of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . we have confirmed that no cross hybridization between the gene specific probes and the nine other full length cdnas occurred . to amplify the gene specific probes the following primer pairs were used _PROTEIN_

the coding regions of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were amplified by polymerase chain reaction with the appropriate primer pairs namely _PROTEIN_ attctagatgaaagactgtgaaaaccacgg and aaggtacccacactaacactacaactagtgg _PROTEIN_ attctagacatggggtccaaacaacc and aaggtaccagataagtcaaagtcacactgc _PROTEIN_ attctagatggcggacttaaacggtgcg and

the pcr products were subcloned into the pgem t easy vector and transformed into escherichia coli . the plasmids carrying the correct inserts were digested with xbai and kpni and the resulting fragments were subcloned into the appropriate sites of the _METHOD_ vector . the resultant constructs were introduced into v. faba leaves by particle bombardment . the leaves were then incubated for more than h at in darkness after which the epidermal layers on the bombarded side were peeled off and observed with a _METHOD_ microscope as described by yang et al . . _PROTEIN_

chlorophyll contents were determined according to the method reported by lichtenthaler . briefly plant leaves powdered with mortar and pestle under liquid nitrogen were extracted with acetone solution and absorbance at nm and nm of the greenish supernatant was measured . the chlorophyll contents were then calculated . signal transduction mutants carrying homozygous _PROTEIN_ together with the mutant alleles were screened in the or progenies resulting from crosses between _PROTEIN_ and the six mutants namely _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and nahg . the details of this screening have been described in takahashi et al .
