in higher multicellular eukaryotes highly specialized _LOCATION_ structures or _LOCATION_ trafficking events are required for supporting various physiological functions . snares _PROTEIN_ play an important role in specific _LOCATION_ fusions . these protein receptors are assigned to subgroubs according to their specific snare structural motif . a specific set of qa qb and qc snares located on the target _LOCATION_ interact with r snare on the vesicle to form a tight complex leading to _LOCATION_ fusion . the zig mutant of arabidopsis lacking qb snare _PROTEIN_ shows little shoot gravitropism and abnormal stem morphology . _PROTEIN_ and its homolog _PROTEIN_ exhibit partially overlapping but distinct intracellular localization and have different biological functions in plants . little is known about how snares are targeted to specific organelles even though their functions and specific localization are closely linked . here we report that a novel mutation in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was found as a dominant suppressor of zig . the _PROTEIN_ mutation gave _PROTEIN_ the ability to function as _PROTEIN_ by changing both the specificity of snare complex formation and its intracellular localization . one amino acid substitution drastically altered _PROTEIN_ allowing it to suppress abnormalities of higher order physiological functions such as gravitropism and morphology . the _PROTEIN_ mutation may be an indication of the flexibility in plant cell function afforded by gene duplication particularly among the _PROTEIN_ genes and their recently diverged orthologs .
a number of diverged snare orthologous genes have been found in higher eukaryotic genomes . the arabidopsis genome has snare genes and the molecular functions of several snares have been extensively analyzed . forward genetic studies have provided evidence that snares are involved in a number of diverse physiological functions . a recent study of cytokinesis specific _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ has attempted to address the more general issue of cell biology such as snare specificity with the tools of molecular genetics . we have found that the zig and _PROTEIN_ mutants deficient in qb snare _PROTEIN_ and qa snare _PROTEIN_ respectively are gravitropic mutants of arabidopsis . _PROTEIN_ is localized in the trans _LOCATION_ network prevacuolar compartment and _LOCATION_ and _METHOD_ a snare complex with _PROTEIN_ and which are located on the pvc and _LOCATION_ . although direct interactions of r snares with _PROTEIN_ have not yet been observed studies for subcellular localization and examination of the _LOCATION_ proteome have suggested the family of proteins as possible r snare candidates . the zig mutant exhibits anomalous morphogenesis in addition to abnormal gravitropism . the zig phenotype is characterized by small wrinkled leaves and alternately bending primary and _PROTEIN_ inflorescence _METHOD_ . arabidopsis wild type inflorescence _METHOD_ bent upward when they were gravistimulated by horizontal placement becoming nearly perpendicular in approximately min . in contrast zig inflorescence _METHOD_ showed little response as reported previously . to understand the genetic basis of _PROTEIN_ mediated vesicular transport we have isolated several suppressor mutants of zig from _METHOD_ mutagenized zig seeds . one of the suppressor lines zig suppressor _PROTEIN_ strongly suppressed the defects of zig both in gravitropism and morphogenesis . the _PROTEIN_ zig double mutant had a wild type phenotype for both inflorescence _METHOD_ and rosette leaves and had a gravitropic response similar to wild type and _PROTEIN_ / zig / zig plants . all of the f generation progeny resulting from a cross of the double mutant line _PROTEIN_ zig with the zig mutant line had the wild type phenotype indicating that _PROTEIN_ is a dominant suppressor of zig both for morphogenesis and gravitropism . in gravity sensing cells of higher plants amyloplasts which are _LOCATION_ that accumulate dense starch granules are thought to act as statoliths . in wild type arabidopsis shoots endodermal cells serve as the gravity sensing cells and contain amyloplasts that sediment in the direction of gravity . amyloplasts did not sediment in either zig or _PROTEIN_ mutants suggesting that _LOCATION_ integrity mediated by tgn pvc/vacuole vesicle trafficking is important for amyloplast sedimentation . electron microscopy of zig endodermal cells showed that the amyloplasts were distributed in the peripheral cytoplasm whereas in the _PROTEIN_ zig double mutant amyloplasts are sedimented and surrounded by the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ with a thin cytoplasmic layer similar to that which has been observed in the wild type . thus _PROTEIN_ is likely to restore the functional integrity of the _LOCATION_ suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ mutation may restore vesicle trafficking mediated by _PROTEIN_ . we cloned the _PROTEIN_ gene relative to its map position . a single nucleotide substitution converts glutamate to lysine in _PROTEIN_ of the zig _PROTEIN_ mutant . the zig plants transformed with _PROTEIN_ harboring the _PROTEIN_ mutation had the same phenotype as _PROTEIN_ zig plants indicating that the _PROTEIN_ mutation was in _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ single homozygote appears to be the same as wild type under normal growth conditions . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ share a high degree of amino acid sequence similarity but _PROTEIN_ interacted with _PROTEIN_ and on the pvc/vacuole whereas _PROTEIN_ formed a complex with and on the tgn . how does the _PROTEIN_ mutation in _PROTEIN_ suppress the defects of _PROTEIN_ ? because _PROTEIN_ of excess _PROTEIN_ protein suppressed the phenotypic defects of zig to some extent we initially tested whether the _PROTEIN_ mutation causes an increase of _PROTEIN_ protein levels in the _PROTEIN_ zig double mutant . protein extracts of the inflorescence _METHOD_ from wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ zig _PROTEIN_ / zig / zig and _PROTEIN_ / _PROTEIN_ zig / zig plants were immunoblotted with anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . the amount of _PROTEIN_ protein in zig plants was higher than in the wild type columbia ecotype . the increase of _PROTEIN_ protein in mutants lacking _PROTEIN_ may be due to increased _PROTEIN_ or stabilization of _PROTEIN_ protein suggesting the presence of a feedback mechanism that regulates homologous snare protein levels . however this increased _PROTEIN_ protein can not fully compensate for the functions of _PROTEIN_ as the zig mutant exhibits an obvious aberrant phenotype . most importantly there was no significant difference in levels of _PROTEIN_ among the zig _PROTEIN_ / zig and _PROTEIN_ / _PROTEIN_ zig mutant lines . this result clearly indicates that the _PROTEIN_ mutation changed the character of _PROTEIN_ protein but not its _PROTEIN_ level resulting in suppression of the zig phenotype . we analyzed whether the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein interacts with _PROTEIN_ by immunoprecipitation analysis with anti _PROTEIN_ antibody for wild type _PROTEIN_ zig and _PROTEIN_ zig protein extracts from inflorescence _METHOD_ . in zig plants a little _PROTEIN_ protein formed snare complexes with _PROTEIN_ indicating that wild type _PROTEIN_ has some ability to interact with _PROTEIN_ but it was not sufficient to substitute for _PROTEIN_ function . most importantly coimmunoprecipitated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels in the _PROTEIN_ zig line increased approximately fold compared with wild type _PROTEIN_ in zig plants . this result suggests that the _PROTEIN_ mutation promotes the formation of snare complexes with _PROTEIN_ which is not a normal partner of _PROTEIN_ so that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ can substitute for _PROTEIN_ . in wild type plants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ show partially overlapping but distinct intracellular localization . _PROTEIN_ is localized to tgn and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ whereas _PROTEIN_ is associated with tgn and pvc/vacuole . their snare partners and _PROTEIN_ are localized to tgn and pvc/vacuole respectively . in _PROTEIN_ zig plants however coimmunoprecipitation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ suggests that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ should colocalize with _PROTEIN_ on the same organelle _LOCATION_ . before doing localization analyses with _METHOD_ fused proteins we confirmed whether _METHOD_ fused _PROTEIN_ is functional by introducing _METHOD_ fused _PROTEIN_ driven by its native promoter _PROTEIN_ into zig plants . transgenic plants had wild type morphology and gravitropism indicating that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is functional . in elongating root cells of transgenic plants _METHOD_ was observed on _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ by confocal laser scanning microscopy . many dot like signals of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were observed at the cell surface which probably correspond to pvc or tgn . in cultured cells the _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ found on _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ tgn and pvc whereas _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was on _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ tgn and pvc . it should be noted that the localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts is quite similar to root cells of p _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants . with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as the target protein _METHOD_ is observed on _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and dot like organelles that are probably tgn and/or pvc . there is a high correlation between the change in snare binding partner and localization of _PROTEIN_ on _LOCATION_ normally occupied by _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutation . the specific localization of snare proteins is a prerequisite for correct protein trafficking . there is not a clearly conserved rule however about how snares are targeted to specific organelles . interactions between the n terminus of the snare motif and vesicle coat proteins have been suggested as one mechanism for snare targeting . the _PROTEIN_ mutation could change the targeting specificity of _PROTEIN_ possibly by affecting recognition by vesicle coat proteins . whether snares are transported individually or as complexes has also remained controversial . if family proteins are transported as a snare complex _PROTEIN_ could influence binding affinity to _PROTEIN_ resulting in the transport of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to pvc/vacuoles together with _PROTEIN_ . in any case the reason a _PROTEIN_ mutation at an amino acid conserved in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ gives _PROTEIN_ the ability to act as _PROTEIN_ should be addressed in the future . recently we have observed movement of amyloplasts and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in living gravity sensing endodermal cells and found that a flexible _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ structure enclosing amyloplasts is important for gravity sensing . vesicle trafficking between tgn and pvc/vacuole is crucial for _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ dynamics . considering that a few _PROTEIN_ genes are involved in _LOCATION_ function shoot gravitropism of arabidopsis is the physiological phenotype that most sensitively indicates the state of tgn to pvc/vacuole vesicle trafficking . suppressor genetics of sgr mutants would be valuable for unraveling a genetic network of complex post _LOCATION_ trafficking in planta . furthermore _PROTEIN_ is involved not only in gravitropism but also morphology of arabidopsis . the present study demonstrated that the _PROTEIN_ mutation a single amino acid substitution can convert both specificity and localization of _PROTEIN_ to those of _PROTEIN_ for functional tgn pvc/vacuole trafficking resulting in recovery of higher order physiological functions such as gravitropism and morphology in zig mutant lines . arabidopsis has four family snares _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in seedlings at a lower level than _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ whereas _PROTEIN_ of was detected only in cultured cells . although _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have distinct functions phenotypic analysis of mutants revealed that _PROTEIN_ plays a major role in planta . because the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutation was lethal in the embryonic stage _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ must have at least partially redundant functions . the molecular functions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are interchangeable to some extent because there is a small amount of interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the zig mutant and there is some minor interaction of with _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . mice also have multiple copies of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which are likely to have distinct functions with some redundancy . in addition _PROTEIN_ a splicing variant of mouse _PROTEIN_ has an insertion of seven amino acid residues in the region adjacent to the amino terminus of the snare motif which is likely to result in a new sorting destination . a possible analogy between mouse and arabidopsis is that family snares may have diverged in their functions to accommodate the complex post _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ traffic but have retained some functional overlap . if this proves to be the case this flexible feature of may allow additional novel or redundant functions with a minor molecular change as in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cases .
the columbia ecotype of arabidopsis thaliana was used as the wild type . the extragenic suppressor mutant lines of zig were isolated from the population of zig that had been mutagenized with _METHOD_ . arabidopsis thaliana plants were grown in soil under constant white light at . intact plants with primary _METHOD_ cm in length were placed horizontally in darkness at as described previously to examine the gravitropic responses of inflorescence _METHOD_ . the curvature of the stem was measured every min as the angle formed between the growing direction of the apex and the horizontal base line . individuals of each genotype were examined . electron microscopic observation was performed as described by morita et al . . confocal laser scanning microscopic observations of the cultured cells were performed as described . observations of p _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants were performed with a leica dmre microscope equipped with a model confocal scanner and cooled ccd camera _LOCATION_ . the _PROTEIN_ zig double homozygous mutant was crossed to wassilewskija allele zig plants to generate a mapping population . genetic analyses of _PROTEIN_ revealed that the suppressor phenotypes are due to a single dominant mutation . progeny with the zig phenotype were selected for mapping . we made some cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence markers that can recognize _METHOD_ between col and ws based on information provided by the arabidopsis information resource . the position of _PROTEIN_ fell approximately in the mb region between markers and _PROTEIN_ . because the _PROTEIN_ gene locates to the mapped locus the region encompassing the _PROTEIN_ gene was sequenced . the _PROTEIN_ gene of _PROTEIN_ zig contained a single nucleotide substitution whereas the _PROTEIN_ gene of zig was identical to wild type . for complementation analysis the kb genomic dna fragment of _PROTEIN_ was amplified from _PROTEIN_ zig and wild type plant genome dna by pcr and cloned into binary vector . the resulting constructs pbin_ and pbin_ were transformed into agrobacterium tumefaciens strain _PROTEIN_ and introduced into zig plants . plants were selected by resistance to kanamycin . the presence of the transgene in these plants was confirmed by pcr . most zig plants containing pbin_ exhibit normal morphology and gravitropism . immunoprecipitation of detergent extracts from the shoots was carried out as described with minor modifications . plasmids and carrier dna were introduced into protoplasts that had been generated from arabidopsis suspension cultures as described previously . _METHOD_ fused _PROTEIN_ cdna was introduced into zig plants under the control of authentic kb _PROTEIN_ promoter which had been used for a complementation test of the zig mutant described previously .
