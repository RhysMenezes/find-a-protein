is a major cell surface adhesion molecule for hyaluronan a component of the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and is implicated in tumor metastasis and invasion . we reported previously that hyaluronan oligosaccharides induce cleavage from tumor cells . here we show that engagement of promotes cleavage and tumor cell migration both of which were suppressed by a metalloproteinase inhibitor kb and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases _PROTEIN_ but not by _PROTEIN_ . we also present evidence that blockade of metalloproteinase disintegrin by rna interference suppresses cleavage induced by its ligation . engagement of concurrently induced activation of the small _PROTEIN_ and led to drastic changes in cell morphology and actin _LOCATION_ with redistribution of to newly generated _LOCATION_ ruffling areas . a _METHOD_ resonance energy transfer approach to visualize _PROTEIN_ bound in living cells revealed the localization of the active in the leading edge of the _LOCATION_ ruffling areas upon ligation of . taken together our results indicate that the cleavage of catalyzed by is augmented by the intracellular signaling elicited by engagement of through rac mediated cytoskeletal rearrangement and suggest that cleavage contributes to the migration and invasion of tumor cells .
engagement of with mab induces cleavage of reported previously that ha oligosaccharides can enhance cleavage from tumor cells . we thus determined whether ligation of induces its cleavage using a highly invasive human glioma cell line which was shown previously to have high cleavage activity . when cells were incubated with a mab to _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ tethered cleavage products of to kda were clearly detected in the lysate of cells by western blotting using a pab against cytoplasmic domain of anti pab . the induction of cleavage by _PROTEIN_ mab was dose dependent and reached a plateau at . the cleavage was not observed when rat igg was used as a control antibody to _PROTEIN_ . the bands of full length were still detected after _PROTEIN_ mab treatment showing that more than of remains uncleaved on the cell surface estimated by densitometric analysis . basically identical results were obtained using the human _PROTEIN_ carcinoma cell line _PROTEIN_ paca . next we tried to detect released into the culture supernatants . when the culture supernatants of cells were immunoblotted with anti human pab which recognizes the ectodomain of a band of kda was observed . when the cells were treated with _PROTEIN_ mab the intensity of the band increased to almost the same level when cleavage was induced by _PROTEIN_ . the effects of both _PROTEIN_ mab and _PROTEIN_ on cleavage were markedly abrogated by a hydroxamate type metalloproteinase inhibitor kb indicating that the induction of cleavage by mab is mediated by metalloproteinases . kb is an inhibitor acting on _PROTEIN_ metalloproteinases _PROTEIN_ including _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with a broad spectrum . to further investigate the involvement of metalloproteinases in cleavage we used _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the natural inhibitors of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ which inhibits the activity of most _LOCATION_ type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ did not inhibit _PROTEIN_ mab induced cleavage whereas _PROTEIN_ whose inhibitory effect on mt _PROTEIN_ activities is much less than _PROTEIN_ effectively inhibited the mab induced cleavage dose dependently . these results were similar to those of _PROTEIN_ induced cleavage . these findings imply that the enzyme responsible for mab induced cleavage is a metalloproteinase other than mt _PROTEIN_ . mab induced cleavage is independent on pkc and _LOCATION_ calcium mab induced cleavage exhibits similar pattern as in the case of _PROTEIN_ a known activator of pkc . thus to determine whether mab induced cleavage requires activity of pkc like _PROTEIN_ induced cleavage we tested the effects of a specific pkc inhibitor on cleavage . _PROTEIN_ induced cleavage was inhibited dose dependently by as expected whereas mab induced cleavage was not affected . these results imply that the signaling _METHOD_ involved in mab induced cleavage may be different from those that operate in _PROTEIN_ induced cleavage . in addition to _PROTEIN_ mab and _PROTEIN_ cleavage is also induced by influx of _LOCATION_ calcium ion into the _LOCATION_ by the ionophore ionomycin . thus we tested whether _LOCATION_ calcium ion is required for mab induced cleavage . although ionomycin did not induce cleavage in the absence of _LOCATION_ calcium ion _PROTEIN_ mab yet induced cleavage in the same condition . these results indicate that the _LOCATION_ calcium ion is not required for cleavage induced by _PROTEIN_ mab . hitherto basically identical results were obtained using another anti mab instead of _PROTEIN_ mab indicating that cleavage induced by ligation of with mab is mediated by a distinct pathway from those by _PROTEIN_ or ionomycin . engagement of promotes migration of cells through cleavage of has been reported to be a receptor for ha and to be associated with cell migration . cleavage was shown previously to play a critical role in tumor cell migration . to determine whether the ligation of promotes dependent cell migration through metalloproteinase mediated cleavage we performed modified boyden chamber type migration assays . as shown in fig . _PROTEIN_ mab treatment enhanced the migration of cells on ha . the enhanced migration was inhibited by pretreatment with an anti blocking mab but not by a non blocking mab hermes . these mabs did not inhibit the basal level cell migration . these results indicate that the migration enhanced by _PROTEIN_ mab treatment was dependent on the ha interaction . next we examined the effect of metalloproteinase inhibitors used in the cleavage assay on the cell migration . the hydroxamate type metalloproteinase inhibitor kb effectively inhibited the cell migration enhanced by stimulation with _PROTEIN_ mab to the basal level . when tissue inhibitors were used _PROTEIN_ also inhibited the enhanced migration whereas _PROTEIN_ did not . neither of these agents changed the basal level cell migration ability . kb and _PROTEIN_ were the inhibitors that suppressed cleavage as described above . these results therefore indicate that a certain metalloproteolytic activity that cleaves is involved in mediated migration and suggest that cleavage induced by mab contributes to the migration of tumor cells . is involved in cleavage induced by engagement of of the metalloproteinases whose activity is known to be inhibited by _PROTEIN_ and not by _PROTEIN_ is . to verify that is the responsible enzyme for cleavage endogenous _PROTEIN_ of adam genes was silenced by rnai . efficient and specific knockdown in cells was monitored by rt pcr and western blot analysis of cell lysates after transfection with sirna . as shown in fig . sirna to suppressed cleavage induced by ligation of whereas sirna to did not . these results indicate that is involved in cleavage induced by ligation of . engagement of induces _LOCATION_ ruffling and accumulation of in the ruffling the cells were treated with _PROTEIN_ mab the cells changed their morphology extending broad lamellipodial _LOCATION_ protrusions . was redistributed to the _LOCATION_ ruffling area where polymerized actin was concentrated . we then examined the relationship between the cytoskeletal rearrangement and cleavage both of which were induced by ligation of by disrupting actin polymerization with cytochalasin d. as shown in fig . cytochalasin d inhibited the cleavage induced by _PROTEIN_ mab indicating that the cytoskeletal rearrangement enhances the cleavage . engagement of promotes activation which mediates cleavage and cell induced cytoskeletal rearrangements shown in fig . were highly reminiscent of the lamellipodial outgrowth caused by activation of rac one of the rho family small _PROTEIN_ . we therefore speculate that the ligation of elicits intracellular signals to activate rac which causes the _LOCATION_ ruffling and the lamellipodial protrusion . to confirm this hypothesis biochemically we performed the pull down assay for _PROTEIN_ bound using a recombinant binding domain of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fused with glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ . as shown in fig . virtually no active was pulled down from lysates of untreated cells whereas the amount of active was distinctly increased within min of incubation with _PROTEIN_ mab reached a maximum within min and persisted for at least min . activation of was not enhanced when the cells were incubated with rat igg an isotype matched control igg . following activation cleavage was detected significantly within min . next we determined the causal link of cleavage to activation by introducing dominant negative mutant of into cells . as shown in fig . the cleavage induced by its ligation was abrogated in the cells transfected with . moreover cell migration enhanced by ligation of was also inhibited by _PROTEIN_ of . these results suggest that cleavage induced by ligation of is mediated by activation which upregulates cell migration . _PROTEIN_ of the rho family cycle between gdp bound inactive and _PROTEIN_ bound active _METHOD_ . the cycle is regulated by the activator guanine nucleotide exchange _PROTEIN_ and the inactivator guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors as well as by _PROTEIN_ activating proteins that promote hydrolysis of _PROTEIN_ . the effects of rac might be controlled by regulating the subcellular localization of its activation . thus we developed a method based on fret that enables us to observe spatial and temporal regulation of activity . we designed a fusion protein comprising and _METHOD_ as illustrated in fig . and introduced this fusion protein into cells as a protein biosensor together with _PROTEIN_ labeled with the acceptor dye bodipy tr . binding of bodipy tr _PROTEIN_ to _METHOD_ brings bodipy tr close to _METHOD_ and increases fret from _METHOD_ to bodipy tr . when cells harboring _METHOD_ and bodipy tr _PROTEIN_ were imaged for _METHOD_ and fret _METHOD_ was detected diffusely within the cells whereas virtually no fret signals were detected without any stimulation suggesting that is localized in the _LOCATION_ in its gdp bound inactive form . when the cells were stimulated with _PROTEIN_ mab _LOCATION_ protrusion was initiated and fret signal distinctly appeared at regions of the leading edge of the cells within min reached its maximum at min and persisted at least min . this time course corresponds to the biochemically acquired data shown in fig . indicating that activation is visualized spatially and temporally . on the other hand activation of in response to _PROTEIN_ mab was not observed by using _METHOD_ . no morphological changes and fret signals from _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were observed when the cells were treated with a control igg . these results suggest that ligation of with _PROTEIN_ mab promotes _LOCATION_ protrusion and activation in the peripheral leading edges .
