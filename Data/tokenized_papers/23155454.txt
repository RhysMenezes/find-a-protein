the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ has a unique network like morphology . the _LOCATION_ structures are composed of tubules cisternae and three way junctions . this morphology is highly conserved among eukaryotes but the molecular mechanism that _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ morphology has not yet been elucidated . in addition certain brassicaceae plants develop a unique _LOCATION_ derived organelle called the _LOCATION_ body . this organelle accumulates large amounts of _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ but its physiological functions are still obscure . we aimed to identify a novel _PROTEIN_ required for _PROTEIN_ the morphology of the _LOCATION_ including _LOCATION_ bodies and employed a forward genetic approach using transgenic arabidopsis thaliana _METHOD_ with _METHOD_ labeled _LOCATION_ . we isolated and investigated a mutant _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ with huge aggregates and abnormal punctate structures of _LOCATION_ . _LOCATION_ encodes a gdsl lipase/esterase family protein also known as _PROTEIN_ . here we showed that although _LOCATION_ was _PROTEIN_ ubiquitously the morphological defects of _LOCATION_ were specifically seen in a certain type of cells where _LOCATION_ bodies developed . coimmunoprecipitation analysis combined with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ revealed that _LOCATION_ interacts with the _PROTEIN_ complex a huge protein complex that is thought to be important for _LOCATION_ body related defense _METHOD_ . we also found that the depletion of transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a master regulator for _LOCATION_ body formation suppressed the formation of _LOCATION_ aggregates in _LOCATION_ cells suggesting that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plays an important role in the abnormal aggregation of _LOCATION_ . our results suggest that _LOCATION_ is required for preventing _LOCATION_ and other organelles from abnormal aggregation and for _PROTEIN_ proper _LOCATION_ morphology in a coordinated manner with _PROTEIN_ .
we isolated a recessive mutant that had defective _LOCATION_ morphology from chemically mutagenized _METHOD_ h and designated it the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ mutant . this mutant developed a huge aggregate of _LOCATION_ and a number of punctate structures on the peripheral meshwork of cotyledon cells . this aggregation of _LOCATION_ was also seen in petioles hypocotyls roots and root hairs . electron microscopy revealed that the _LOCATION_ aggregate in an _LOCATION_ cell comprised a huge aggregate of cytoplasm . in wild type cells most organelles are distributed in a thin layer between _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . mitochondria and _LOCATION_ were recognized as circular structures and _LOCATION_ were found as large compartments with internal _LOCATION_ and starch granules . _LOCATION_ were pushing cytoplasm towards _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ lumens showed relatively less electron density . _LOCATION_ bodies as described previously were gray colored and surrounded by ribosomes . in the enlarged view _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ bodies were closely contacting each other . _LOCATION_ had a number of ribosomes on its _LOCATION_ surface . in _LOCATION_ cells on the other hand these organelles were engulfed into the aggregate of cytoplasm . it contained various organelles such as _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ bodies _LOCATION_ bodies mitochondria _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . this result was consistent with results obtained by confocal microscopic analysis . in addition to the clearly identifiable organelles the cytoplasm was also filled with abnormal structures . enlarged views of these structures are shown in the right column of . these abnormal structures had ca . nm nm _PROTEIN_ which was _PROTEIN_ than typical _LOCATION_ cisternae . we found them surrounded by ribosomes and occasionally connected to typical _LOCATION_ cisternae indicating that these abnormal structures were derived from _LOCATION_ . these results show that the isolated _LOCATION_ mutant had morphological defects in the _LOCATION_ and aberrant intracellular distribution of not only _LOCATION_ but also most organelles . transgenic arabidopsis _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ sp _METHOD_ hdel was observed under a confocal microscope . _LOCATION_ was isolated from chemically mutagenized _METHOD_ h seeds and subjected to confocal microscopy . in _METHOD_ h cells the typical _LOCATION_ network and _LOCATION_ bodies were seen . in _LOCATION_ cells punctate structures and huge aggregates were seen in addition to the typical network and

_LOCATION_ had defects in the organization of actin filaments we _PROTEIN_ tdtomato a _METHOD_ actin marker protein in _LOCATION_ and _METHOD_ h plants . in _METHOD_ h typical actin networks which are composed of a number of thin filaments and several _PROTEIN_ bundles were seen _METHOD_ . similarly _LOCATION_ also developed typical actin networks and the _LOCATION_ strands were aligned on _PROTEIN_ actin bundles . the aggregate in _LOCATION_ cells was caged and penetrated with actin filaments _LOCATION_ . disruption of these actin cages by an actin polymerization inhibitor did not suppress the formation of aggregates . this inhibitor treatment induced the collapse of the _LOCATION_ meshwork and the formation of abnormal _LOCATION_ structures as was also seen in _METHOD_ h but the inhibitor not affect the nature of _LOCATION_ aggregates in _LOCATION_ cells . our findings are summarized as follows the actin network was properly organized in _LOCATION_ cells _LOCATION_ interacted with actin filaments in _LOCATION_ cells and in wild type cells in a similar manner and the formation of _LOCATION_ aggregates in _LOCATION_ cells was independent of actin cages . these findings suggest that _LOCATION_ had defects at either downstream of the actin _LOCATION_ interaction or in another molecular mechanism independent of actin filaments . confocal images obtained from plants of _LOCATION_ transformed by tdtomato . panels in the middle row are enlarged views of top panels . the aggregates were surrounded by organized actin filaments . bottom row images show that the peripheral actin network was properly organized . bars . seedlings of _METHOD_ h and _LOCATION_ were treated with of latrunculin b an actin inhibitor for hours . green arrowheads indicate lat b induced aggregates which were derived from collapsed _LOCATION_ networks . in the presence of lat b _LOCATION_ aggregates were still similar to those of non treated cells . bars . we examined the _LOCATION_ genome and were able to identify a single base pair substitution at the locus . in the _LOCATION_ genome an adenine guanine sequence at the splicing junction between the second intron and the third exon was substituted with an adenine adenine sequence . this substitution caused a splicing defect in _PROTEIN_ of this locus as revealed by rt pcr . the two most prominently transcribed mrnas in _LOCATION_ seedlings were sequenced . the shorter mrna _LOCATION_ was spliced using another adenine guanine sequence resulting in a base pair deletion . the protein translated from this mrna has an eight amino acid deletion . on the other hand the second intron was not spliced out in the longer mrna _LOCATION_ resulting in the translation of a amino acid insertion followed by a stop codon _LOCATION_ . we then isolated two t dna inserted lines _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ levels of this locus were investigated by quantitative real time pcr . the results showed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ little mrna and was an additional knock out allele of this locus . loss of mrna _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ was also seen both in roots and aerial tissues . we stably introduced the sp _METHOD_ hdel protein into and found that this line also contained _LOCATION_ aggregates and _LOCATION_ derived punctate structures both of which were similar to those in _LOCATION_ cells . we crossed _LOCATION_ with _PROTEIN_ and the resulting individuals also contained _LOCATION_ aggregates and the punctate structures . together these results indicate that _LOCATION_ is located on and that the morphological defects observed in _LOCATION_ was not specifically due to splicing defects of this locus . gene model and protein structure of . base pair substitution found in _LOCATION_ and t dna insertion sites

aerial tissues of _METHOD_ h and _LOCATION_ were subjected to qpcr . _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ was detected in all three tissues of col while none was detected in _LOCATION_ . p < p < p < . _LOCATION_ is the same gene as the recently reported modified _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which encode a gdsl lipase/esterase family protein . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants were identified by the aberrant morphology of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ and _LOCATION_ bodies _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ respectively which is consistent with our observation that various organelles including _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ bodies were engulfed in the _LOCATION_ aggregates in _LOCATION_ . the molecular mechanism by which these aggregates were formed remained unsolved in the report by agee et al . marti et al . concluded that the export of _LOCATION_ out of the _LOCATION_ was required for the _PROTEIN_ of organelle organization . to understand the molecular mechanism involved in _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ morphology we focused on the subcellular localization of _LOCATION_ . at first this localization remained unclear . marti et al . concluded that _LOCATION_ was localized in the _LOCATION_ while agee et al . initially reported that this protein was localized at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ bodies and tonoplast . the results of marti et al . were based on experiments using _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants while agee et al . based their results on _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transient _PROTEIN_ assay data . we used another _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ in combination with our knock out allele _LOCATION_ under the constitutive _PROTEIN_ promoter . _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ labeled the _LOCATION_ lumen and the _LOCATION_ but not aggregates indicating that this protein functioned well enough to suppress the formation of _LOCATION_ aggregates . to reveal if labeling of the _LOCATION_ was an artificial effect of overexpression we treated _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants with a ribosome inhibitor . after treatment for hours entire signals disappeared from the _LOCATION_ while the _LOCATION_ lumen still fluoresced . this suggests that _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ was translated in the _LOCATION_ and transported to the _LOCATION_ lumen further supporting the conclusion of marti et al . _LOCATION_ is a member of the gdsl lipase/esterase family and appears to be a pseudoenzyme . we generated a cdna encoding _LOCATION_ with an artificially introduced catalytic center residue . this protein was c terminally fused with _METHOD_ and introduced into the _LOCATION_ mutant under control of the promoter . confocal microscopy revealed that this fused protein was transported to the _LOCATION_ and complemented the _LOCATION_ mutant suggesting that _LOCATION_ can _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ morphology _PROTEIN_ of whether it has enzymatic activity . we concluded that _LOCATION_ was transported to the _LOCATION_ but the morphological defects exhibited by this mutant occurred in the _LOCATION_ . thus we then examined the importance of _LOCATION_ transport of _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ in the _PROTEIN_ of _LOCATION_ morphology . to do this we generated an _LOCATION_ venus hdel construct . a protein that bears the hdel sequence at the c terminus will exit the _LOCATION_ go to the _LOCATION_ bodies and immediately return to the _LOCATION_ resulting in predominant localization at the _LOCATION_ . we introduced this construct into either _LOCATION_ or col and observed the _LOCATION_ morphology through the _METHOD_ of _LOCATION_ venus hdel . unexpectedly the _LOCATION_ morphology in the transformants was not defective and no aggregated _LOCATION_ nor _LOCATION_ derived punctate structures were found indicating that _LOCATION_ venus hdel was functional enough to _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ morphology . this suggests that although native _LOCATION_ seemed to be transported to the _LOCATION_ its role in _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ morphology was exerted between the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ bodies . however since _LOCATION_ retention by hdel is not completely robust we could not exclude the possibility that a part of _LOCATION_ venus hdel was transported to _LOCATION_ via _LOCATION_ bodies and this amount of transport was still enough for _LOCATION_ to _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ morphology . _LOCATION_ protein fused with venus followed by the _LOCATION_ retention signal sequence in its c terminus was stably _PROTEIN_ in col and in _LOCATION_ . in both lines _LOCATION_ venus hdel localized in the _LOCATION_ lumen and _LOCATION_ bodies . notably neither of these developed abnormal aggregates that were seen in _LOCATION_ cells . to reveal the molecular function of _LOCATION_ we next focused on its interaction partners . we employed coimmunoprecipitation analysis using a transgenic arabidopsis line _LOCATION_ that stably _PROTEIN_ hemagglutinin tagged _LOCATION_ . we confirmed the _PROTEIN_ of the tagged proteins in seedlings which we primarily used to observe _LOCATION_ morphology . furthermore to obtain comprehensive insights into the interactome of _LOCATION_ we performed _METHOD_ spectrometric _METHOD_ analysis after the co ip analysis . when the cells were stained with for hours _LOCATION_ ha cells like the non transgenic control did not contain obvious aggregates while _LOCATION_ cells had _METHOD_ aggregates confirming that the _LOCATION_ ha protein was functional . immunoblot analyses using either the anti ha or anti bip _LOCATION_ antibody followed by cbb staining confirmed that _LOCATION_ ha was efficiently concentrated in the bound fraction . seven day old seedlings of nt _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ ha were stained with for hours . _LOCATION_ ha did not develop any aggregates unlike _LOCATION_ . to seven day old seedlings of nt and _LOCATION_ ha were subjected to a co immunoprecipitation assay using anti ha antibodies . total unbound and bound fractions or only the bound fraction from nt and _LOCATION_ ha were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ followed by either immunoblot analysis silver staining or _METHOD_ brilliant blue staining . numbers shown in and indicate relative amounts of loaded fractions . interacting proteins identified by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ are indicated in . glls gdsl lipase like proteins jals jacalin related lectins maths meprin and traf homology domain containing proteins . the bound fractions collected from each of the nt and _LOCATION_ ha were then separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and silver stained . we found several proteins that were specifically located in the _LOCATION_ ha precipitate . to comprehensively identify _LOCATION_ binding proteins whole proteins were subjected to _METHOD_ analysis . the identified proteins are listed in . seed storage proteins contaminated the homogenate and were misidentified as _LOCATION_ binding proteins since we used young seedlings that occasionally still contained seed coats . in addition to the comprehensive assay several major proteins seen in the _LOCATION_ ha precipitate were excised from the stained gel and individually subjected to _METHOD_ analysis . excised bands and the identified protein names are indicated in and in . interestingly most of the proteins identified with relatively high mascot scores were reported to be components of the _PROTEIN_ complex . identified proteins that are known to comprise the _PROTEIN_ complex along with their homologues are listed in . among these proteins interactions with either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ were confirmed by immunoblot analysis . _PROTEIN_ is the primary component of _LOCATION_ bodies as described above and the formation of the _PROTEIN_ complex may play an important role in the _LOCATION_ body system . this led us to speculate that there is a relationship between _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ bodies . proteins with _PROTEIN_ levels that are thought to be regulated by _PROTEIN_ are indicated by bold characters . the localizations of these proteins have been experimentally confirmed or suggested . correlation coefficients of _PROTEIN_ patterns with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . because _LOCATION_ was _PROTEIN_ ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ we expected that _LOCATION_ aggregates would be evident in whole tissues of _LOCATION_ plants . indeed in day old seedlings epidermal cells of petioles hypocotyls roots and root hairs had _LOCATION_ aggregates that were similar to those in cotyledonary cells . in contrast surprisingly most of the cells in rosette leaves from week old plants did not show any defects in _LOCATION_ morphology . importantly several cells from young rosette leaves still contained _LOCATION_ aggregates . we found that these cells contained _LOCATION_ bodies as well while the other cells did not . observing peripheral punctate structures of _LOCATION_ body developing cells we noticed that some cells developed punctate structures and some did not . furthermore although the number was quite less there were the cells with _LOCATION_ bodies but without _LOCATION_ aggregates . to see the nature of punctate structures we observed aged cotyledonary cells of week old plants and found that they had lost punctate structures from their _LOCATION_ network although they still develop the _LOCATION_ aggregates . these results suggest that the punctate structures were gradually suppressed during cell growth and the _LOCATION_ aggregates were then also suppressed during further cell development . _PROTEIN_ of developmental stages of cells our observation of rosette leaves at least indicates that the morphological defects in _LOCATION_ occurred where _LOCATION_ bodies were present . and z projected images or confocal micrographs of rosette leaves from week old _METHOD_ h and _LOCATION_ plants . enlarged views of boxed regions are shown in bottom panels to . arrows open arrows and arrowheads indicate _LOCATION_ bodies _LOCATION_ aggregate in _LOCATION_ and aberrant punctate structures in _LOCATION_ respectively . bars and . z projection or peripheral section of cotyledon epidermal cells from week old _METHOD_ h and _LOCATION_ plants . summarized phenotypes of _LOCATION_ cells during cell development . _LOCATION_ body formation is regulated by a transcription _PROTEIN_ named _PROTEIN_ and in other words the cells that develop _LOCATION_ bodies are the cells where _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . presence of _PROTEIN_ promotes _PROTEIN_ of various proteins including _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and other _LOCATION_ body related proteins . _LOCATION_ is also one of the proteins that previously reported as _PROTEIN_ regulated proteins . we tried to confirm this by qpcr . in all tissues investigated of _PROTEIN_ mutant _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ was partially reduced . the significant amount of remained _PROTEIN_ indicates that regulation of its _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ is limited suggesting that _LOCATION_ is _PROTEIN_ both in the cells with and without _LOCATION_ bodies . it further suggests that the cells with _LOCATION_ bodies required _LOCATION_ for the proper organization of _LOCATION_ while the cells without _LOCATION_ bodies were able to _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ morphology in the absence of _LOCATION_ proteins . since the biggest difference in molecular basis between these two types of cells was _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ we then tried to examine the involvement of _PROTEIN_ in the aggregation of _LOCATION_ in _LOCATION_ cells . we performed two experiments the induction of _LOCATION_ body formation in _LOCATION_ rosette leaves by meja treatment and the depletion of _PROTEIN_ from _LOCATION_ cells . as mentioned above _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ body formation can be induced by meja treatment in rosette leaves where _LOCATION_ bodies are absent under normal conditions . rosette leaves from week old plants were collected and incubated in meja containing water . after days of incubation _LOCATION_ bodies were clearly induced in _METHOD_ h rosette leaves _METHOD_ . _LOCATION_ bodies were also induced in day incubated _LOCATION_ rosette leaves and notably large aggregates of _LOCATION_ were co induced _LOCATION_ suggesting that there is a correlation between the formation of inducible _LOCATION_ bodies and _LOCATION_ aggregates . in these cells we often found tangled _LOCATION_ structures which may act as seeds for _LOCATION_ aggregation . since _LOCATION_ bodies that are on the way of formation are very small in size we could not distinguish them from the _LOCATION_ derived punctate structures . rosette leaves from week old plants were treated with of methyl jasmonate or water as a solvent control for the indicated number of days . reconstructed images are shown . meja treatment induced _LOCATION_ bodies in both _METHOD_ h and _LOCATION_ cells . notably meja treatment co induced _LOCATION_ aggregate formation in _LOCATION_ cells . higher magnification views of day treated _LOCATION_ cells are shown . arrowheads indicate tangled _LOCATION_ which might act as a seed of the _LOCATION_ aggregates . bars . because meja also activates the _PROTEIN_ of various responsive genes as well as _PROTEIN_ we then tried to determine the precise role of _PROTEIN_ by depleting _PROTEIN_ from _LOCATION_ cells . as previously reported the _PROTEIN_ cells developed neither _LOCATION_ bodies nor _LOCATION_ aggregates _PROTEIN_ . to deplete _PROTEIN_ from _LOCATION_ cells we crossed _LOCATION_ with _PROTEIN_ and generated an _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . in _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ cells neither _LOCATION_ bodies nor obvious _LOCATION_ aggregates were found which was also the case with _PROTEIN_ cells _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . this suppression was not observed when either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ was depleted from _LOCATION_ the _PROTEIN_ of both of these proteins is positively regulated by _PROTEIN_ . importantly _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ cells did not have _LOCATION_ bodies while _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ obviously developed huge _LOCATION_ aggregates identical to those seen in _LOCATION_ single mutant cells . depletion of _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ suppressed the formation of _LOCATION_ aggregates . single optical sections of cotyledonary epidermal cells of indicated genotypes . solid and open arrows indicate _LOCATION_ bodies and _LOCATION_ aggregates respectively . bars . reconstructed images of cotyledon and hypocotyl . bars . from our results it was revealed that _LOCATION_ aggregation in _LOCATION_ was correlated with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but not with the formation of _LOCATION_ bodies if it correlated with _LOCATION_ body formation depletion of _PROTEIN_ from _LOCATION_ cells should have resulted in suppression of the morphological defects of _LOCATION_ . our overall results clearly show that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ cells led _LOCATION_ to be disorganized . because _PROTEIN_ is a transcription _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ under the positive control of _PROTEIN_ might be crucial for _LOCATION_ disorganization in _LOCATION_ cells . _LOCATION_ may suppress this function in wild type cells . combined with our co ip results these proteins are suggested to be _PROTEIN_ complex components . according to two previous reports _LOCATION_ might be involved in protein trafficking as _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were mislocalized to the _LOCATION_ from the _LOCATION_ body apoplast and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ respectively . to reveal if _LOCATION_ was directly involved in protein transport we _METHOD_ labeled _LOCATION_ bodies by crossing _LOCATION_ with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ col . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is a _LOCATION_ protein localized to trans _LOCATION_ cesiternae and known to be dispersed to _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ when _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein transport is inhibited . in the cotyledonary epidermal cells of col _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ clearly labeled _LOCATION_ bodies . in _LOCATION_ cells as reported previously _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labeled _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as well as _LOCATION_ bodies showing that _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ transport was inhibited in these cells . next we observed week old rosette leaves of col and _LOCATION_ . in wild type cells as in cotyledonary cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labeled _LOCATION_ bodies _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in _LOCATION_ cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ clearly labeled _LOCATION_ network in the cell with aggregates while it did not in the cell without aggregates _LOCATION_ . it indicates that the defects in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ transport occurred only in the cells with the aggregates but not in the cells without aggregates . combined with the suggestion that _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ both types of the cells our results suggest that _LOCATION_ was involved in endomembrane organization itself and the defective protein transport was due to disorganized _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ interface . cotyledons and rosette leaves from day old col and _LOCATION_ plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were observed under a confocal microscope . in wild type cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ clearly labeled _LOCATION_ bodies . in _LOCATION_ cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labeled _LOCATION_ network as well as _LOCATION_ bodies . this labeling was detected in the cells with aggregates but not in the cells without obvious aberrant structures . bars .
