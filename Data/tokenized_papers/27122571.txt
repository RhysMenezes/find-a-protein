complex i dysfunction causes reorganization of cellular respiration and affects metabolic processes in mitochondria _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and other cellular compartments with drastic consequences for growth and development .
to investigate the consequences of the absence of complex i on the mitochondrial compartment comparative proteome analyses of wt and mitochondria isolated from cell culture lines were performed . proteins were separated by ief/sds _PROTEIN_ and spot volumes were systematically compared using the delta software package . volumes of spots were significantly altered with a fold change of > between wt and lines . forty four spots had higher volume in the mutant whereas spot volumes were increased in wt . all spots were analysed by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . after applying a mascot threshold score of overall a total of identified proteins were included in further analyses . more than one protein was identified for several spots . changes in volume were only assigned to a specific protein if a spot only included one _PROTEIN_ protein . this further reduced the number of unambiguously changed proteins to . sixty six of these proteins were of _PROTEIN_ abundance in the mutant and of increased abundance . these proteins were annotated according to their functional context . comparative analysis of the mitochondrial proteomes of arabidopsis wt and lines . mitochondria were isolated as described in the materials and methods . total mitochondrial protein was separated by ief/sds _PROTEIN_ and proteins were stained by _METHOD_ blue . three replicates were produced per line and used for the calculation of master gels . the molecular _METHOD_ of standard proteins are given to the left of the d gel . isoelectric focusing range is from ph to ph . proteins indicated in pink are more abundant in the mutant proteins indicated in green are less abundant in the mutant _PROTEIN_ . spots indicated by numbers were identified by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . as expected many proteins of reduced abundance were complex i subunits . we did not find all the complex i proteins because ief/sds _PROTEIN_ does not allow separation of very hydrophobic proteins . reduction of complex i subunits was on average fold . it was shown previously by et al . that complex i is completely absent in the mutant however non assembled subunits may be present in mitochondria . furthermore reduction of levels of complex i subunits can be expected to be even higher because nearly all spots included not only one _PROTEIN_ protein but also in addition some proteins of low abundance which probably were of unchanged or not much changed abundance . as a consequence fold changes in general might be slightly higher than determined in the frame of our study . other proteins of reduced abundance in the mutant are involved in the central mitochondrial metabolism whereas many proteins of increased abundance play roles in transport or stress response processes . relative spot volumes of altered proteins involved in defined functional processes in mutant lines . proteins were separated by ief/sds _PROTEIN_ normalized spot volumes of differential oxphos subunits were summed up and relative spot volumes were calculated by the delta software package detailed evaluation of the dataset revealed the following . changes in abundance of tca cycle enzymes were not uniform . we found subunits of citrate synthase _PROTEIN_ malate dehydrogenase _PROTEIN_ and succinyl coa ligase _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ abundance in the mutant whereas a subunit of the oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex _PROTEIN_ was increased . glutamate dehydrogenase _PROTEIN_ was also increased in the mutant . notably several subunits of the _PROTEIN_ translocase were increased _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . several of the most induced proteins in the mutant are involved in plant stress responses . some of the proteins of changed abundance were subunits of the remaining oxphos complexes ii v. again not all of the subunits were identified because many of them are very hydrophobic and not resolvable by ief/sds _PROTEIN_ . it became apparent that several complex iv subunits are clearly induced . to get a more complete impression on how the mutant is altered with respect to the oxphos system we next compared mitochondrial fractions of wt and lines using bn/sds _PROTEIN_ a gel electrophoresis system known to be particularly suitable for analysing _LOCATION_ bound proteins and protein complexes . as previously reported the mutant shows changes in the activities of complex ii and complex iv . in order to evaluate changes in the amounts of the oxphos complexes ii v in the absence of complex i in more detail comparative proteome experiments by bn/sds _PROTEIN_ were performed with mitochondrial _LOCATION_ fractions of wt and cell culture lines . the comparisons were based on two methods delta mediated comparison of d gels and fluorophore based comparison . visual inspection of the bn/sds gels used for delta comparison clearly revealed the absence of complex i and the i supercomplex in the mutant . on the resulting overlay image the complexes and v are more or less unchanged while the complexes ii and iv are clearly increased in the mutant . average spot volumes were calculated for each complex in the two fractions using the delta software . the following amounts of the oxphos complexes were found for the mutant complex ii complex iii complex iv and complex v . proteins within spots were analysed by _METHOD_ and all revealed the expected identifications . comparative analysis of the mitochondrial _LOCATION_ proteomes of arabidopsis wt and lines . mitochondria were isolated as described in the materials and methods . mitochondrial _LOCATION_ proteins were separated by bn/sds _PROTEIN_ and proteins were stained by colloidal _METHOD_ . three replicates were produced per fraction and used for the calculation of a master gel . the molecular _METHOD_ of standard proteins are given to the left of the d gels . oxphos complexes are boxed in their identities are given above the gels . proteins indicated in pink are less abundant in the mutant _PROTEIN_ proteins indicated in green are more abundant in the mutant . spots indicated by numbers were identified by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . relative spot volumes of oxphos complexes in lines . proteins were separated by bn/sds _PROTEIN_ normalized spot volumes of differential oxphos subunits were summed up and relative spot volumes were calculated by the delta software package not detectable a more extended comparison of the mitochondrial _LOCATION_ proteomes of mutant and wt cell lines was carried out based on bn/sds dige . spots differing in volumes between the two fractions were analysed by _METHOD_ after applying a mascot threshold score of overall identified proteins were included in further analyses however a difference in spot volume only could be assigned to a specific protein if a spot included only one _PROTEIN_ protein . this further reduced the number of unambiguously changed proteins to . these were grouped according to functional context . changes of individual subunits of oxphos complexes were in accordance with the results of the delta analysis . in addition several other _LOCATION_ proteins were found to be of changed abundance in the mutant . seven subunits of the _PROTEIN_ and tom transport machineries and one abc transporter were identified . all were more abundant in the mutant . comparative analysis of the mitochondrial _LOCATION_ proteomes of arabidopsis wt and lines by differential gel electrophoresis . mitochondria were isolated as described in the materials and methods . mitochondrial _LOCATION_ proteins of wt and were labeled with different cydyes and separated by bn/sds _PROTEIN_ . proteins were stained by colloidal _METHOD_ . the same gel was used for _METHOD_ detection of the two cydyes . the molecular _METHOD_ of standard proteins are given to the left of the d gel . the identities of selected mitochondrial protein complexes are given above the gels . proteins indicated in red are less abundant in the mutant _PROTEIN_ and proteins indicated in green are more abundant in the mutant . proteins given in yellow are not changed in abundance . spots indicated by numbers were identified by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . note if compared to the comparative experiment shown in several subunits of oxphos complexes appear to be absent in the dige approach . this is due to the _PROTEIN_ that cydye labeling takes place at native conditions . as a consequence only proteins exposed to the surface of protein complexes are labeled . in contrast image evaluation based on the delta approach allows visualization of all subunits of a protein complex . in addition to effects on the mitochondrial compartment the consequences of deletion at the whole plant level were investigated . wild type and mutant plants were harvested at a comparable growth stage and differential protein abundances were analysed by comparative quantitative shotgun _METHOD_ . the experiment was based on five biological replicates . in total different proteins were identified . the quantitative analysis of identified proteins was carried out using maxquant . after application of a _PROTEIN_ p value proteins of changed amounts were confirmed and were included in further analyses . the proteins were assigned into categories according to subcellular localization and functional context . subcellular localization was assigned according to _PROTEIN_ . most of the identified proteins are localized in the _LOCATION_ followed by _LOCATION_ mitochondria and other compartments with minor contributions . proteins of increased abundance in plants are mostly localized in the _LOCATION_ and mitochondria . in contrast proteins of _PROTEIN_ abundance in plants are mostly localized in _LOCATION_ . subcellular localization of proteins of altered abundances in the line as obtained by label free quantitative shotgun proteomics . total protein was extracted from wt and mutant plants at a similar developmental stage . proteins were identified and quantified by shotgun _METHOD_ . predicted localizations of proteins of changed abundances between the two lines were obtained from the _PROTEIN_ database . predicted localization of all proteins changed . predicted localization of proteins more abundant in compared to wt . predicted localization of proteins less abundant in mutant compared to wt . numbers indicate amounts relative to the sum of altered protein species . assignment of proteins differing in amount between wt and mutant plants to functional categories was carried out according to tair functional annotations and evaluated by mapman . proteins especially induced in mutant plants are involved in glycolysis fermentation the tca cycle amino acid metabolism redox regulation protein folding as well as stress responses . _PROTEIN_ protein abundances in plants were _PROTEIN_ found in the functional categories of photosynthesis and tetrapyrrole synthesis . as expected complex i subunits were much _PROTEIN_ in the mutant . at the same time _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and alternative nadh dehydrogenase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were clearly induced . functional annotation of proteins identified by quantitative label free shotgun _METHOD_ . the proteins of differential abundances between wt and mutant plants were grouped into functional bins using mapman . bins are given to the right . proteins more abundant in are indicated in green and proteins that are less abundant in red . each square represents one protein . bins without any identified protein are with a grey dot . relative protein intensities of altered proteins involved in defined functional processes in mutant lines analysed by label free quantitative shotgun _METHOD_ approach . proteins were identified and quantified using maxquant software finally we analysed the bin coverage of the identified proteins in order to assess the influence of the absence of complex i on cellular processes . we calculated the number of identified proteins in relation to the number of genes that code for proteins of the bins . the following bins were most significantly changed in the mutant fermentation glycolysis nitrogen metabolism tca cycle photosynthesis tetrapyrrole synthesis mitochondrial etc and amino acid metabolism . the bin coverage indicates that these cellular process are particularly affected by absence of complex i. bin coverage of proteins of altered abundances in plants as determined by label free quantitative shotgun _METHOD_ changes in protein levels in plants with respect to wildtype plants as obtained by label free quantitative shotgun proteomics are summarized in and in the discussion below . life without complex i . the figure is based on altered protein levels in plants relative to wildtype plants as obtained by label free quantitative shotgun proteomics . green arrows within the grey boxes indicate increased protein levels in the double mutant and red arrows indicate _PROTEIN_ levels . absence of complex i causes reorganization of the cellular respiration system . since electron insertion into the first segment of the metc is not possible increased electron insertion at _PROTEIN_ segments takes place . this requires increased oxidation of organic substrates . mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ formation most likely is still reduced which requires increased fermentation . the growth rate of the double mutant is drastically reduced . this is reflected by reduced amounts of the two _METHOD_ calvin cycle enzymes and enzymes of the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway . furthermore altered metabolism and electron transport pathways in the mitochondria and chloroplasts cause increased ros formation and stress _METHOD_ . several components of the ros and stress defense system are induced in the double mutant as is the alternative oxidase a well known stress indicator in plants . note causal events indicated by black arrows do not necessarily indicate primary effects but may well represent indirect consequences . for further details see the discussion section .
