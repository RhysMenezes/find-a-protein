the hypersensitive necrosis response of resistant plants to avirulent pathogens is a form of programmed cell death in which the plant sacrifices a few cells under attack restricting pathogen growth into adjacent healthy tissues . in spite of the importance of this defense response relatively little is known about the plant components that execute the cell death program or about its regulation in response to pathogen attack . we isolated the _PROTEIN_ mutant an allele of the previously described _PROTEIN_ mutants . we found that _PROTEIN_ exhibited an exaggerated chlorosis and necrosis response to attack by three pathogens two powdery mildew and one downy mildew species but not in response to abiotic stresses or attack by the bacterial leaf speck pathogen . the chlorosis and necrosis did not spread beyond inoculated sites suggesting that _PROTEIN_ limits the initiation of cell death rather than its spread . the pathogen induced chlorosis and necrosis of _PROTEIN_ was correlated with a stimulation of the salicylic acid defense pathway and was suppressed in mutants deficient in salicylic acid signaling . _PROTEIN_ encodes a novel protein with a pleckstrin homology and a star transfer _PROTEIN_ domain as well as a plant specific domain of unknown function _PROTEIN_ . the pleckstrin homology domain binds to phosphatidylinositol phosphate in vitro and an _PROTEIN_ ha _METHOD_ protein localizes to _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and endosomes . _PROTEIN_ acts as a negative regulator of cell death specifically the cell death elicited by pathogen attack and mediated by the salicylic acid defense pathway . phosphatidylinositol phosphate may have a role in limiting cell death via its effect on _PROTEIN_ . this role in cell death may be indirect by helping to target _PROTEIN_ to the appropriate _LOCATION_ or it may play a more direct role .
the _PROTEIN_ mutant was indistinguishable from wild type in growth and development up to weeks of age . the wild type remained free of lesions whether inoculated with the powdery mildew pathogen or not . the mutant did not develop lesions spontaneously . it only became chlorotic and formed lesions at infection sites and did not support visible fungal growth _PROTEIN_ . the lesions on _PROTEIN_ leaves did not spread to non infected parts of inoculated leaves or to uninoculated leaves of the same plant . at _PROTEIN_ stages the petioles of _PROTEIN_ leaves were slightly shorter and the leaves tended to be crinkled . macroscopic phenotypes of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . uninfected plants at d after germination wild type _PROTEIN_ . three week old plants photographed at dpi with g. cichoracearum

_PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the severity of the _PROTEIN_ phenotype varied with inoculation density . fungal growth measurements up to days post inoculation obtained under very low inoculation densities are similar on col and _PROTEIN_ . similarly their macroscopic phenotypes were identical up to this time point . by contrast when fungal growth was monitored at dpi under high inoculum density the mutant and wild type were clearly distinguished with wild type supporting significantly more fungal growth than _PROTEIN_ . under these conditions wild type leaves had an average of conidiophores per whereas the _PROTEIN_ mutant had conidiophores per . the timing of macroscopic lesion formation in the mutant varied with inoculation density and as also reported by tang et al . _PROTEIN_ occurred relatively _PROTEIN_ in the infection cycle compared to the rapid hr typically elicited by incompatible interactions governed by plant resistance and pathogen avirulence genes . macroscopically the first lesions appeared dpi at high inoculation densities and dpi at low inoculation densities . the wild type plants did not develop visible lesions upon powdery mildew infection _PROTEIN_ of inoculum density . fungal infection eventually led to an apparent acceleration of senescence in a density dependent fashion in both wild type and mutant but the amount of chlorosis was greater in the mutant . at dpi leaves infected with conidia per had chlorotic tissue in the wild type whereas the _PROTEIN_ leaves had chlorotic and necrotic tissue . the amount of necrotic tissue in the mutant also correlated with the inoculation density . thus at dpi with conidia per the _PROTEIN_ mutant had chlorotic tissue and necrotic tissue . cell death was also monitored microscopically at various time points during the infection process under high inoculation density . in wild type plants no macroscopic lesions were observed upon inoculation with g. cichoracearum and only rare groups of more than three collapsed mesophyll cells were observed dpi . up to dpi _PROTEIN_ leaves were indistinguishable from wild type with no apparent cell death . by dpi a few isolated epidermal and mesophyll cells appeared dead in _PROTEIN_ and were usually associated with fungal hyphae . the first small groups of dead mesophyll cells also appeared dpi . from to dpi these lesions were more frequent and increased in size

. to ascertain whether lesion formation on _PROTEIN_ leaves was specifically triggered by pathogen infection plants were treated with several types of abiotic stress . no macroscopic or microscopic lesions were observed after any of these treatments as determined by visual observation and trypan blue staining . after wounding the amount and the localization of dead cells were comparable in col and in _PROTEIN_ and no spreading cell death was observed in the mutant . a number of lesion mimic mutants exhibit resistance to a broad spectrum of pathogens . to determine the resistance specificity of _PROTEIN_ mutant plants were _PROTEIN_ with an oomycete pathogen hyaloperonospora parasitica and a bacterial pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv tomato . the level of _PROTEIN_ resistance to a biotrophic h. parasitica was evaluated by counting the number of sporangia per cotyledon at dpi . at high inoculum concentration the wild type had sporangia per cotyledon whereas the _PROTEIN_ mutant had . at lower inoculum concentrations wild type and mutant were indistinguishable . a second h. parasitica strain showed reduced growth and elicited lesions when inoculated onto the leaves of week old _PROTEIN_ plants . the number of spores per were and for wild type and _PROTEIN_ respectively . p. syringae tomato multiplies in both col and _PROTEIN_ plants eventually producing water soaked lesions . unlike the response to powdery mildew the timing and extent of macroscopic and microscopic symptom development were similar for mutant and wild type plants _PROTEIN_ of the concentration of inoculum . the estimation of bacterial titers in the infected leaves did not reveal any significant difference between bacterial multiplication rates in col and _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ plants which carry the _PROTEIN_ resistance gene mounted a normal hypersensitive necrosis response following infiltration with the avirulent bacterial strain carrying the gene . similar results were reported by tang et al . _PROTEIN_ . the loss of _PROTEIN_ function did not interfere with the ability of the plants to mount a normal hr . some lesion mimic mutants are disease resistant because defenses including the sa signal transduction pathway are constitutively activated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . similar to the results of tang et al . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transcript levels a marker for the sa pathway in uninfected _PROTEIN_ plants were negligible and similar to uninfected wild type plants indicating that the sa pathway was not constitutively activated in the mutant . after dpi _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was induced in both wild type and mutant plants and _PROTEIN_ levels remained high up to dpi . the level of _PROTEIN_ induction was two fold higher in _PROTEIN_ relative to col plants at every time point suggesting possibly that _PROTEIN_ mutants are predisposed to respond to a stimulus activating the sa pathway . this stimulus may be lesion formation as sa levels increase following treatments that induce lesions _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is enhanced in _PROTEIN_ . northern blot showing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ at various times following inoculation of col or _PROTEIN_ with g. cichoracearum . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in col and _PROTEIN_ at days following treatment with water mm bth or mm sa . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in col and _PROTEIN_ at hpi with or cfu per ml of p. syringae pv tomato . _PROTEIN_ levels were also monitored in plants treated with sa and the sa mimic bth . as expected these treatments induced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in both col and _PROTEIN_ . however in the mutant plants _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ was two fold higher than in wild type plants . the same trend in _PROTEIN_ up regulation occurred in _PROTEIN_ plants infected with the virulent bacterium p. syringae tomato in a dosage dependent manner . the transcript levels of the _PROTEIN_ gene encoding an anti microbial defensin a marker for the jasmonate/ethylene signal transduction pathway over the time course used for _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ analysis were not significantly different between _PROTEIN_ and col . to analyze the involvement of the major defense signaling pathways double mutants with defects in the sa or jasmonate/ethylene pathways were analyzed for their resistance and lesion phenotype . resistance was lost in plants _PROTEIN_ the nahg gene and in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant _PROTEIN_ . similar to _PROTEIN_ the double mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ did not support fungal growth and showed lesion formation _PROTEIN_ . at the microscopic level the lesion phenotype was not suppressed by the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutations but was lost in _PROTEIN_ plants _PROTEIN_ nahg and in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . thus the sa pathway contributes to lesion formation and the resistance phenotype in _PROTEIN_ mutants . since g. cichoracearum is an obligate biotrophic pathogen requiring living host tissue for growth the resistance phenotype is likely a consequence in part of the inability of the chlorotic and lesioned tissue to support growth of this pathogen . the segregation analysis of plants from a cross between _PROTEIN_ and wild type suggested that the _PROTEIN_ mutation was linked to a single t dna insertion and that both the disease resistance and the lesion phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ following powdery mildew infection were due to a unique recessive mutation . the _PROTEIN_ gene was isolated by cloning the regions flanking the t dna insert . sequencing revealed that the t dna was inserted in a predicted intron of gene a gene cloned previously as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . a kb fragment covering this putative gene was cloned into a binary ti plasmid and used to transform homozygous _PROTEIN_ plants . the wild type phenotypes were restored in of the plants tested . the progeny of six of these plants segregated for powdery mildew resistance as expected . a cdna for the _PROTEIN_ gene was isolated by rt pcr . its sequence was identical to the ncbi deduced cdna sequence . the genomic sequence of _PROTEIN_ which is composed of exons and introns extends nucleotides . the coding sequence is nucleotides long and encodes for a protein of amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of kd . the _PROTEIN_ protein consists of an n terminal pleckstrin homology domain a central region with a star related

level . two other genes in the arabidopsis genome and are predicted to encode proteins that display the same domain structure as _PROTEIN_ with ph _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ domains . these proteins show relatively little sequence similarity to _PROTEIN_ . a survey of published gene _PROTEIN_ profiling data showed that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in all organs _PROTEIN_ corroborating gus _PROTEIN_ results from tang et al . _PROTEIN_ . its _PROTEIN_ did not vary substantially during development with the exception that in stamens and senescing leaves _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were fold higher than in most other organs or developmental stages . as observed by tang et al . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were generally unresponsive to biotic stresses . the highest inductions were elicited by inoculation with the necrotrophic fungal pathogen botrytis cinerea at hpi and by the bacterial pathogen p. syringae tomato at hpi . in contrast transcript levels were generally those of _PROTEIN_ during development and in various organs and mostly below the level of reliable detection in the biotic stress experiments . transcript levels of were very low and not detected in most organs

procedures were previously described . the barley powdery mildew blumeria graminis f.sp . hordei race was _PROTEIN_ on barley variety ci and inoculated onto barley or arabidopsis plants as described . _PROTEIN_ and infiltration with pseudomonas syringae pv tomato and inoculation with h. parasitica were performed as described by vogel and somerville . bacterial growth curves were performed by estimating the titers of bacteria in leaves up to dpi _PROTEIN_ . some powdery mildew inoculations were performed at high and low densities . inoculation densities were assessed by placing cover slips coated with agar among plants to be inoculated and then counting the number of conidia per by light microscopy . unless stated otherwise macroscopic disease development and lesion formation was monitored at dpi . the extent of g. cichoracearum growth was quantified by one of two methods . at low inoculation densities the total hyphal length of individual fungal colonies was measured periodically up to dpi and the total number of conidiophores per colony were counted at dpi . at high inoculation densities the number of mature conidiophores per field of view was determined at dpi . in each case pictures of five randomly chosen fields of view per leaf and a minimum of leaves per experiment were used to assess fungal growth . growth of h. parasitica was monitored as described in . all experiments were conducted at least twice . using week old plants at dpi areas of healthy chlorotic and dead tissues were measured on leaves of each treatment from photographs taken with a spot camera attached to a dissecting microscope _PROTEIN_ . the photographs were imported into photoshop and the `` magic wand tool '' was used to decompose the image into three components green tissue yellow tissue and brown tissue . the area of each of these three components was measured with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ software and used to calculate the percentage of total leaf area corresponding to each of the three components . the staining method used to visualize fungal colonies and the software program employed to measure total hyphal length were described previously . microscopic lesions and fungal structures were visualized by staining the leaves with trypan blue . callose staining with aniline blue and the visualization of _METHOD_ compounds were described in adam and somerville . hydrogen peroxide was visualized with diamino benzidine hcl . transformants of _PROTEIN_ containing the construct encoding the edr ha _METHOD_ driven by the _PROTEIN_ promoter were germinated on

. standard genetic crosses were used to make double mutant lines of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the transgene nahg . plants homozygous for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ and nahg were identified by pcr . the _PROTEIN_ mutation was identified in plants by their lack of root growth inhibition when grown on murashige and skoog medium supplemented with aminocyclopropane _PROTEIN_ acid . the _PROTEIN_ mutation was identified in plants that did not exhibit a stunted growth habit when grown in murashige and skoog medium containing methyl jasmonate . the _PROTEIN_ mutation was generated by inserting a kb t dna fragment containing a right border _PROTEIN_ and a left border the bar gene the nptii gene and a fragment of an leucine rich repeat gene driven by the promoter . given both that the phenotype of _PROTEIN_ resembles that of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and that the rescue experiment with the cloned _PROTEIN_ gene restored the wild type phenotype to the _PROTEIN_ mutant we feel that the additional sequences in this construct did not contribute to the phenotypes described in the text . to test cosegregation of the _PROTEIN_ mutation with the t dna _PROTEIN_ was crossed to col and plants were first analyzed for disease phenotypes dpi with g. cichoracearum and then scored for resistance to _PROTEIN_ . to clone _PROTEIN_ genomic
