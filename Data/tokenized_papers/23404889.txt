the basic leucine zipper transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ acid _PROTEIN_ is a key regulator of abscisic acid mediated seed germination and postgermination seedling growth . while a family of sucrose related protein is responsible for aba induced phosphorylation and stabilization of _PROTEIN_ the phosphatase responsible for dephosphorylating _PROTEIN_ is still unknown . here we demonstrate that mutations in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ two homologous genes encoding the catalytic subunits of ser/thr protein _PROTEIN_ cause an aba hypersensitive phenotype in arabidopsis thaliana including aba mediated inhibition of seed germination and seedling growth . conversely overexpression of fypp causes reduced sensitivity to aba . the aba hypersensitive phenotype of fypp loss of function mutants is _PROTEIN_ dependent and the amount of phosphorylated and total _PROTEIN_ proteins inversely correlates with the levels of fypp proteins . moreover fypp proteins physically interact with _PROTEIN_ in vitro and in vivo and the strength of the interaction depends on the _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation status . in vitro phosphorylation assays show that fypp proteins directly dephosphorylate _PROTEIN_ . furthermore genetic and biochemical assays show that fypp proteins act antagonistically with kinases to regulate _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation and aba responses . thus arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ phosphatase regulates aba signaling through dephosphorylation and destabilization of _PROTEIN_ .
_PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the catalytic subunits of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ phosphatases _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis share high sequence homology . publically available data _METHOD_ _METHOD_ show that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is upregulated by imbibition during seed germination which is opposite to that of _PROTEIN_ suggesting the involvement of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in regulating seed germination . to test this we first investigated the germination of columbia _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seeds and seeds from self pollinated plants on germination medium plates containing various concentrations of aba . we used seeds from self pollinated plants in these experiments because the homozygous double mutant plants are completely infertile . the results showed that both and single homozygous mutants had similar germination and greening percentages as col at the tested aba concentrations while the seeds from self pollinated plants had much lower germination and greening percentages than col at the tested aba concentrations . genotyping analysis revealed that among the progeny of self pollinated plants incubated on aba plates all geminated seeds were of the genotype while the nongermination seeds consisted of three genotypes and . these observations indicate that seeds of the and genotypes were hypersensitive to aba . we next investigated the root growth of single mutants and double mutants on gm plates containing or aba . the double mutants have shorter roots and smaller/fused cotyledons than col at the early seedling stage and we therefore chose seedlings for our stress experiment based on these phenotypes . we observed that the relative root growth of the mutants was much reduced compared with that of col whereas there were no obvious differences in the relative root growth of or single mutants and col . again this observation indicates that the double mutants but not the or single mutants are hypersensitive to aba . to confirm our observations we investigated the aba responses of ethanol inducible lines which were generated by introducing the alca alcr _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cassette into the _PROTEIN_ single mutant background . we chose two lines for our experiments . the results showed that after ethanol induction the seed germination and greening percentages of both lines were reduced compared with col at the tested aba concentrations with showing a more severe phenotype than . interestingly there was no greening of seeds after d on gm plates containing ethanol but not aba . rt pcr analysis showed that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was undetectable in and dramatically reduced in while ethanol itself had no effect on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ indicating that the aba hypersensitive phenotype of the transgenic plants after ethanol induction is specifically due to the reduced _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene . we also observed that the relative root growth of on gm plates with aba was much slower than that of col after ethanol induction further confirming that the plants are hypersensitive to aba . to further investigate the function of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in aba signaling we investigated the seed germination and greening percentages of fypp overexpressing and fypp dominant negative transgenic lines . the results showed that the and seeds had much lower germination percentages after or aba treatment compared with col seeds while the and seeds had significantly higher germination percentages with aba treatment compared with col seeds . additionally the greening percentages of and seedlings were much lower while the greening percentages of and seedlings were much higher than that of col when treated with aba . thus and transgenic lines showed a similar seed germination phenotype as the seeds from self pollinated plants and the transgenic lines while the and transgenic plants displayed the opposite seed germination phenotype as seeds from self pollinated plants and transgenic lines . taken together these observations suggest that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ play critical roles in aba signaling and negatively regulate aba responses . since _PROTEIN_ is known as a key regulator of seed germination we next tested the genetic interactions between fypps and _PROTEIN_ . we introduced the and mutations into the _PROTEIN_ mutant background . we generated plants that were homozygous for and _PROTEIN_ but heterozygous for _PROTEIN_ and obtained seeds from these self pollinated plants in our germination assays . we observed that the seeds from self pollinated _PROTEIN_ plants self pollinated plants and _PROTEIN_ mutants as well as the col controls all germinated and grew well on gm plates lacking aba . seeds from self pollinated plants were hypersensitive to aba as expected whereas seeds from selfed _PROTEIN_ plants were insensitive to aba similar to _PROTEIN_ . we next introduced the and mutations into transgenic plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . similarly we generated plants homozygous for and _PROTEIN_ but heterozygous for _PROTEIN_ and obtained seeds from these self pollinated plants in our experiments . without aba treatment seeds from both self pollinated plants and _PROTEIN_ plants germinated and grew well . interestingly we observed that of seeds from self pollinated _PROTEIN_ plants did not germinate after d on gm plates although they eventually germinated after a longer incubation period . genotyping showed that these seeds were all _PROTEIN_ homozygotes . after treatment with aba the _PROTEIN_ seedlings underwent growth arrest after d although their germination percentages were comparable to those of the seeds from self pollinated plants and col controls at this stage while the germination percentage of the seeds from self pollinated _PROTEIN_ plants was much lower that of the _PROTEIN_ seeds and the growth of seedlings segregated from _PROTEIN_ was more severely inhibited compared with the _PROTEIN_ seedlings . genotyping analysis showed that after aba treatment all of the germinated seeds from self pollinated _PROTEIN_ plants were of the _PROTEIN_ genotype while the nongermination seeds had three genotypes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . these observations indicate that the loss of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ activity enhanced the sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ seeds to aba . we also crossed transgenic lines with _PROTEIN_ plants . as shown in figure without aba treatment col _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ double mutants germinated and grew well while in the presence of aba the growth of the _PROTEIN_ seedlings was more severely inhibited than that of the _PROTEIN_ double mutants seeds and col wild type controls . these results suggest that enhanced fypp activity can largely overcome the effects of _PROTEIN_ overexpression in response to aba . taken together these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ act through the _PROTEIN_ pathway to regulate aba responses . we next performed a series of experiments to test whether _PROTEIN_ could serve as a substrate of fypp proteins . yeast two hybrid assays showed that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ specifically interacted with _PROTEIN_ but not with other key regulators of aba signaling including the aba receptors _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ phosphatases _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the kinase _PROTEIN_ and the downstream transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . domain deletion analysis showed that the n terminal region of _PROTEIN_ protein mediated the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in yeast cells . moreover luciferase complementation imaging assays showed that both cluc _PROTEIN_ and cluc _PROTEIN_ interacted with nluc fusions of _PROTEIN_ and group i _PROTEIN_ like proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but not nluc fusions of group ii _PROTEIN_ like proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . furthermore coimmunoprecipitation assays showed that myc _PROTEIN_ coimmunoprecipitated with _PROTEIN_ ha and _PROTEIN_ but not with green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ ha in tobacco leaves further confirming the interaction between fypps and _PROTEIN_ in vivo . to identify the subcellular localization of the interaction between fypps and _PROTEIN_ we performed bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation in onion epidermal cells . we observed strong yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ signals in the _LOCATION_ of onion cells bombarded with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ plasmids but no _METHOD_ signal was detected in onion cells bombarded with the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ control plasmids . in arabidopsis plants the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins were detected in the _LOCATION_ the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ . these observations indicate that the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ occurs in the _LOCATION_ in planta . taken together these data indicate that there is a direct interaction between fypps and _PROTEIN_ . since _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ directly interacted with _PROTEIN_ we next tested whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ could directly dephosphorylate _PROTEIN_ . a previous study reported that the _PROTEIN_ fragment _PROTEIN_ is phosphorylated by the _PROTEIN_ kinases . we therefore performed in vitro phosphorylation experiments using glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ tagged _PROTEIN_ purified from escherichia coli cells as the substrate and protein extracts prepared from col and seedlings treated with aba or with control solvent as the kinase sources . equal amounts of protein extracts and substrates were coincubated in these assays . no phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was detected in any sample without aba treatment indicating that phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ is aba dependent which is consistent with previous reports . however after aba treatment the amounts of phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were higher in samples incubated with protein extracts from and transgenic seedlings while the amounts of phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were slightly lower in samples incubated with protein extracts from and seedlings compared with col . these data suggested that there is a correlation between _PROTEIN_ activity and phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to confirm this observation we performed in vitro phosphorylation/dephosphorylation assays . we incubated equal amounts of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ proteins and protein extracts from aba treated col or seedlings . we added various amounts of purified wild type _PROTEIN_ phosphatase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ null mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to the samples mixed with protein extracts from seedlings and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ proteins . the results showed that the addition of exogenous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ reduced the amounts of phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the more _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein added the less phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ detected . additionally when we used mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as the substrate we did not observe a phosphorylation band by the mutant extracts . these data together suggest that _PROTEIN_ proteins play a critical role in regulating the phosphorylation status of _PROTEIN_ . it was reported that the ser/thr sites in the conserved xargxxser/thr motif of _PROTEIN_ are the targets of kinases including _PROTEIN_ and . to test whether these ser/thr sites mediate the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and fypps we conducted site directed mutagenesis and substituted these ser/thr sites with either ala or asp residues thus generating the dephosphorylation mimic mutant _PROTEIN_ or phosphorylation mimic mutant _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ . assays showed a stronger interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ than the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and wild type _PROTEIN_ . this observation suggests that phosphorylation of these ser/thr sites in the conserved xargxxser/thr motifs plays an important role in mediating the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and fypp . phosphorylation plays a critical role in regulating protein stability . we next tested whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may also be involved in regulating _PROTEIN_ protein stability . we germinated col and seeds and seeds from self pollinated plants on gm plates containing or aba . after varying incubation time under continuous white light we extracted their total rnas and proteins . we used the anti _PROTEIN_ specific antibodies in the immunoblot analysis . citation detected and kd _PROTEIN_ bands with the and kd bands predominating in immunoblot assays using this _PROTEIN_ antibody whereas we detected two bands in this study and in the previous report . the results showed that in the presence of aba _PROTEIN_ proteins were hyperaccumulated in the and seeds and seeds from self pollinated plants but reduced in the and seeds compared with col . consistent with previous reports _PROTEIN_ proteins were quickly degraded in germinated seeds due to diminished aba levels . quantitative rt pcr analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was highly induced in all lines in response to aba compared with the col controls . these results suggest that the differential accumulation of _PROTEIN_ proteins in these plants is most likely due to posttranscriptional regulation . consistent with this seeds from self pollinated plants and and mutants had lower germination rates after aba treatment whereas and seeds had higher germination rates compared with col . it was reported that _PROTEIN_ is highly induced and stabilized by aba but is degraded rapidly after the removal of aba . to investigate how fypps function in this process we treated col and seeds with aba for d and then removed the aba and grew the seeds on gm plates . we harvested samples after various incubation time points for protein and rna extraction . immunoblot analysis showed that after the removal of aba _PROTEIN_ was more abundant in the fypp loss of function mutants such as and seeds after ethanol induction but this protein was more rapidly degraded in the and seeds compared with col . gene _PROTEIN_ assays showed that _PROTEIN_ mrna was inhibited to comparable levels in all seeds after removal of aba . together these observations support the notion that fypps are essential for posttranscriptional regulation of _PROTEIN_ in response to aba removal . we next investigated the effect of aba on the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ regulated aba responsive genes in the fypp loss of function mutants . two rd genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have _PROTEIN_ in their promoters and are transactivated by _PROTEIN_ . citation also showed dramatically reduced aba inducibility of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ seedlings . our quantitative rt pcr assays showed that the _PROTEIN_ of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was upregulated in col and mutants after aba treatment with a hyperinduction of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the fypp loss of function mutants . these observations suggest that the aba hypersensitivity of fypp loss of function mutants was due to the hyperaccumulation of _PROTEIN_ proteins resulting in upregulation of downstream aba responsive gene _PROTEIN_ . 'because phosphatases and kinases show antagonistic effects on aba signaling we were interested in understanding the genetic interactions between and fypps . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plays a critical role in mediating various aba responses and its loss of function mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ displays a hypersensitive phenotype in response to drought stress and resistance to aba during seed germination . additionally the single mutants of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ do not display obvious aba related phenotypes whereas _PROTEIN_ is more resistant to aba during seed germination than the wild type . we therefore introduced the _PROTEIN_ mutation into and mutant backgrounds . we generated plants homozygous for and _PROTEIN_ but heterozygous for _PROTEIN_ and obtained seeds from these self pollinated plants for our germination/growth assays . our results showed that seeds from self pollinated plants and mutants were sensitive to aba as expected while seeds from self pollinated _PROTEIN_ plants or the _PROTEIN_ double mutants were more tolerant to aba than their or parental lines respectively . on the other hand compared with the _PROTEIN_ mutants seeds from self pollinated _PROTEIN_ plants and the _PROTEIN_ double mutants were still sensitive to aba . consistent with this observation the _PROTEIN_ protein levels in aba treated seeds of self pollinated _PROTEIN_ plants and _PROTEIN_ double mutants were reduced compared with aba treated or parental lines respectively . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ attenuates the aba hypersensitivity of seeds from self pollinated and and that fypps function antagonistically with _PROTEIN_ kinases in mediating aba signaling . since fypp loss of function mutants are hypersensitive to aba we were interested in understanding how aba regulates _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ protein stability . we treated d old and seedlings with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide for h and then added aba or the control solvent _METHOD_ . we harvested the samples after different incubation time and performed immunoblot assays . the results showed that the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein levels in seedlings and the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein levels in seedlings _PROTEIN_ after treatment with aba but not after the addition of _METHOD_ . these observations suggest that aba promotes degradation of fypp proteins .
