arabidopsis synaptotagmin _PROTEIN_ has been reported to participate in an unconventional secretory pathway in somatic cells . our results showed that _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the pollen of arabidopsis thaliana . the pollen of _PROTEIN_ t dna and rna interference mutant lines exhibited reduced total germination and impeded pollen tube growth . analysis of the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein in the pollen tube indicates that _PROTEIN_ was localized to distinct patchy compartments but could co localize with the _LOCATION_ markers bodipy tr ceramide and mcherry . however _PROTEIN_ dsred was localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in arabidopsis suspension cells in addition to the _LOCATION_ apparatus . the localization of _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was further supported by _METHOD_ staining in pollen tubes . moreover brefeldin a treatment inhibited the transport of _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and caused _PROTEIN_ to aggregate and form enlarged compartments . truncation of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domains also resulted in retention of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ apparatus . an in vitro phospholipid binding assay showed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domains bind to the phospholipid _LOCATION_ in a calcium dependent manner . take together our results indicated that _PROTEIN_ was required for pollen germination and pollen tube growth and was involved in conventional exocytosis .
to understand the physiological role of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ we analyzed _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ in various organs using a gene specific rt pcr and a promoter gus reporter system . the result of real time pcr showed that _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in freshly harvested and non hydrated pollen grains whereas its _PROTEIN_ was relatively very low in roots _METHOD_ leaves and siliques . the results of semi quantitative rt pcr also indicated a high level of _PROTEIN_ transcript in the inflorescence and stamens . in a tissue specific _PROTEIN_ study of _PROTEIN_ a native _PROTEIN_ promoter was fused to a gus reporter gene and introduced into wild type arabidopsis . two independent lines of gus transgenic arabidopsis were selected for an intermediate level of gene _PROTEIN_ from a transgenic population according to quantitative fluorometric and qualitative histochemical gus analyses . the histochemical and fluorometric gus assay showed that the highest gus activity was in the inflorescence . quantitative analysis of _PROTEIN_ promoter activity was conducted using one of the transgenic lines and showed that maximum activity was in flower buds shortly before anthesis and the strongest signal was in stamens and to a lesser extent pistils . detailed histochemical examination suggested that the gus staining was limited to developing female gametophytes and developing male gametophytes . the growing pollen tubes showed strong gus staining under in vitro conditions . since gus staining was present both in ovules and pollen tubes we performed reciprocal crossing of the psyt gus transgenic line with wild type arabidopsis to discriminate these two signals after pollination . no gus staining was observed in the wild type ovules after pollination with transgenic pollen grains nevertheless the staining of transgenic pollen tubes was evident in the pistils . these data suggested that _PROTEIN_ was also _PROTEIN_ in pollen tubes grown in vivo in pistils . on the other hand after the pistils of transgenic plants were pollinated by pollen from wild type plants gus staining of the fertilized and enlarged ovules became weaker and disappeared while the unpollinated ovules remained small and strongly stained . these results suggested that _PROTEIN_ could play a role in the development of embryo sacs and pollen grains as well as in the pollen germination and tip growth of pollen tubes . we obtained three arabidopsis mutants named _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from the salk collection with t dna located in the second intron the ninth exon and another position of the ninth exon of respectively . mutant lines with different t dna insertion sites on the _PROTEIN_ locus were screened by genomic pcr with _PROTEIN_ and t dna border specific primers . the genotyping results are shown in b . the level of the _PROTEIN_ transcript in _PROTEIN_ was very low and could not be detected by rt pcr . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ only showed a trace amount of _PROTEIN_ transcripts . arabidopsis rnai lines were also generated to investigate the function of _PROTEIN_ . one _PROTEIN_ rnai line with reduced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was identified by rt pcr and used for further investigation of phenotype . pollen germination percentages of the homozygous t dna insertion mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and an rnai line were calculated and compared with the wild type by in vitro means of germination assays . results showed that the relative germination efficiency of pollen from t dna mutants ranged from to at h after imbibition and the relative germination efficiency of pollen from the rnai line was . we also calculated the germination percentages at h after imbibition and the data showed that both the _PROTEIN_ mutants and wild type pollen grains already reached their maximal germination percentages after h of imbibition . the final pollen germination percentages of _PROTEIN_ mutants were lower than that of wild type . these results indicated that _PROTEIN_ contributed to pollen viability . to determine whether mutation of the _PROTEIN_ gene affected pollen tube elongation we measured the lengths of pollen tubes of wild type and mutant lines germinated for h on in vitro medium . average lengths of the pollen tubes were in the wild type and from to in the mutants . the homozygous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and rnai lines represented a and reduction in the average length of pollen tubes respectively . more than of wild type pollen tubes were longer than and only were shorter than . the mutants had a markedly lower percentage of pollen tubes longer than compared with the wild type . the proportions of pollen tubes < were considerably higher in the mutant lines especially the rnai mutant . we found of rnai pollen tubes to be < . we also measured the lengths of pollen tubes from h to h and the results showed that the pollen of _PROTEIN_ mutants had already germinated and grown much the same length as that of wild type at h . however the growth rates of pollen tubes of _PROTEIN_ mutants were slower than that of wild type after h. in addition the growth rates of pollen tubes of both wild type and the mutant lines were very slow after h of imbibition but the growth rate of _PROTEIN_ mutant was still lower than that of wild type . thus we showed that the shorter pollen tubes of _PROTEIN_ mutants were not due to delayed germination but retarded elongation . these data demonstrated that the _PROTEIN_ gene also played a role in elongation of pollen tubes . although the pollen tubes of _PROTEIN_ mutants were shorter than wild type pollen tubes the mutants exhibited pollen tubes long enough to accomplish fertilization which may explain the lack of a marked difference in seed setting percentage between the mutants and wild type plants . to evaluate the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ two plant _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were used including stable _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ driven by a promoter in transgenic arabidopsis and transient _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in tobacco pollen grains by microparticle bombardment with a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct . the results for both showed that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was localized to distinct patches in the growing pollen tubes but rarely to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in stable transgenic _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ arabidopsis the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ containing compartments were co localized with the _LOCATION_ dye bodipy tr ceramide and the _LOCATION_ marker mch the cytoplasmic tail and transmembrane domain of fused with mcherry which was transiently _PROTEIN_ by particle bombardment but not the endocytic vesicle marker and the _LOCATION_ tracker blue white dpx . to further examine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ we treated the pollen tubes with the secretion inhibitor bfa and the _PROTEIN_ endosomes/autophagy inhibitor wortmannin for min after h of germination . the results showed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ formed enlarged aggregates after bfa treatment and decorated around the stained bfa compartments featuring the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . wortmannin slightly changed the morphology of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ vesicles in the pollen tubes but _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was not accumulated into the wortmannin induced multivesicular compartments indicating that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was not localized to the trans _LOCATION_ network and the prevacuoles . as a control the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ protein alone showed diffuse distribution in the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ in tobacco pollen tubes . the results of transiently transforming _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ into tobacco pollen showed results similar to those in arabidopsis . to confirm the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ in pollen tubes we performed _METHOD_ labeling of _PROTEIN_ using a _PROTEIN_ specific antibody . the results indicated that _PROTEIN_ was localized not only to the _LOCATION_ apparatus but also to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in pollen tubes . however since the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signal was very weak on the margin of transgenic pollen tubes it was difficult to determine if _PROTEIN_ was located on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or the endocytosis derived vesicles in the pollen tubes . to confirm that _PROTEIN_ was localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ we first examined the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in arabidopsis suspension cells and found that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal had a patchy distribution around the _LOCATION_ in suspension cells whereas _METHOD_ alone showed diffuse localization in the _LOCATION_ and inside the _LOCATION_ . however the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal near the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in suspension cells was too weak to be imaged clearly . previous studies showed that dsred changes its _METHOD_ color over time shifting from green to red _METHOD_ after maturation . the ratio of green to red _METHOD_ can be used to estimate the age of the fusion protein . therefore we employed dsred to label _PROTEIN_ and established a stably transformed arabidopsis suspension cell line _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ dsred driven by a promoter . the _PROTEIN_ dsred fusion protein in suspension cells displayed a patchy distribution similar to that of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in tobacco and arabidopsis pollen tubes . moreover _PROTEIN_ dsred _METHOD_ signal was also clearly detected on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in the red _METHOD_ channel while dsred alone was diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm and inside the _LOCATION_ . a z stack projection of the images in a is shown in b . by comparing the _METHOD_ lines on the cell periphery with the non _METHOD_ trans _LOCATION_ cytoplasmic strands we inferred that the fine _METHOD_ lines were not on the tonoplast but on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in addition the plasmolysis assay indicated that _PROTEIN_ was not localized to the cell wall . detailed analysis of the punctate structures around the _LOCATION_ revealed that these spots emitted both green and red _METHOD_ . moreover green _METHOD_ on the punctate structures around the _LOCATION_ was considerably stronger than that on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ while the red _METHOD_ showed a less marked difference . this result indicated that the _PROTEIN_ dsred proteins localized to the _LOCATION_ apparatus around the _LOCATION_ were newly synthesized and those localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ represented the older _PROTEIN_ dsred population . to further characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of _PROTEIN_ dsred we performed quantitative analysis and calculated the ratio of green to red _METHOD_ intensity on vesicles around the _LOCATION_ vesicles near the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ from the original grayscale images . as shown in b the green _METHOD_ on both v and v vesicles was stronger than the red _METHOD_ as the green/red signal ratio of v was and that of v was . red _METHOD_ on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was stronger than the green _METHOD_ as the green/red signal ratio of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was . the intensities of green and red _METHOD_ signals of dsred alone in the cells were similar with a green/red signal ratio of . a previous study reported that a red/green ratio indicated that the dsred protein was produced more than h ago in vitro in caenorhabditis elegans cells and approximately more than h ago in cowpea mesophyll protoplasts . this indicated that the majority of _PROTEIN_ dsred proteins on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ had been synthesized at least h previously which demonstrated that the _PROTEIN_ protein was transported from the _LOCATION_ apparatus to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ over time . we further examined the localization of _PROTEIN_ dsred in the suspension cells after treatment with the secretion inhibitor bfa . compared with untreated cells cells treated with bfa for and min displayed enlarged _PROTEIN_ vesicle aggregates and the _METHOD_ signal of _PROTEIN_ dsred on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was reduced . quantitative analyses of the green/red _METHOD_ signal ratio of the vesicles and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ at different time points with bfa treatment are shown in d. the results showed that the green/red _METHOD_ ratio of vesicles _PROTEIN_ over time following treatment with bfa . for the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ the green/red _METHOD_ ratio was increased after bfa treatment . the intensities of dsred green and red _METHOD_ signals in the suspension cells were approximately the same . these results suggested that the newly synthesized _PROTEIN_ dsred protein was _PROTEIN_ incorporated into the bfa compartments and was not transported to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ whereas old _PROTEIN_ dsred protein seemed to be retained on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the results showed clearly that _PROTEIN_ was transferred to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ via the conventional secretory pathway in arabidopsis suspension cells . arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ contains two _PROTEIN_ domains _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was similar to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was similar to _PROTEIN_ . to characterize the role of _PROTEIN_ domains in the localization of _PROTEIN_ we created a potential dominant negative _PROTEIN_ mutant lacking the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ domains _PROTEIN_ . similar to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulated in distinct patches in the cytoplasm and was highly co localized with the ceramide stained _LOCATION_ apparatus . _PROTEIN_ dsred also showed distinct patchy distribution in the cytoplasm and there was no obvious difference between the distributions of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ dsred . however unlike the full length of _PROTEIN_ dsred only a trace amount of _PROTEIN_ dsred red _METHOD_ was detected on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . these results suggested that the _PROTEIN_ domains of _PROTEIN_ played a role in directing _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . we further investigated whether the _PROTEIN_ domains of _PROTEIN_ could bind to the negatively charged liposomes and found that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ peptide was able to bind a phospholipid in a calcium dependent manner . the maximum concentration of free ca binding to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was and a higher calcium ion concentration did not increase binding of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to the liposomes . moreover binding of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to the liposomes was calcium independent . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was associated with liposomes in the absence of free ca and this binding was not enhanced by increased calcium concentration . the binding property of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ differed from those of the two individual domains indeed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ behaved as an approximate mixture of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . half maximal binding of _PROTEIN_ to phospholipids was approximately of free ca while that of _PROTEIN_ was about . as controls all the _PROTEIN_ domains of _PROTEIN_ were subjected to different concentrations of na and mg . the effects of na and mg on the binding of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domains with liposomes were found to be insignificant . these data indicated that the _PROTEIN_ domains of _PROTEIN_ were bound to phospholipids in _LOCATION_ and that this binding was regulated by calcium ions .
