plant mitochondria play central roles in cellular energy production metabolism and stress responses . recent phosphoproteomic studies in mammalian and yeast mitochondria have presented evidence indicating that protein phosphorylation is a likely regulatory mechanism across a broad range of important mitochondrial processes . this study investigated protein phosphorylation in purified mitochondria from cell suspensions of the model plant arabidopsis thaliana using affinity enrichment and proteomic tools . eighteen putative phosphoproteins consisting of mitochondrial metabolic enzymes _PROTEIN_ a protease and several proteins of unknown function were detected on separations of arabidopsis mitochondrial proteins and phosphoproteins using the diamond dye . comparisons with mitochondrial phosphoproteomes of yeast and mouse indicate that these three species share few validated phosphoproteins . phosphorylation sites for seven of the eighteen mitochondrial proteins were characterized by titanium dioxide enrichment and _METHOD_ . in the process phosphopeptides from arabidopsis proteins which are not present in mitochondria but found as contaminants in various types of mitochondrial preparations were also identified indicating the low level of phosphorylation of mitochondrial components compared with other cellular components in arabidopsis . information gained from this study provides a better understanding of protein phosphorylation at both the subcellular and the cellular level in arabidopsis .
previous reports of mitochondrial phosphorylation had utilized the incorporation of through the incubation of _PROTEIN_ with isolated mitochondrial samples citation citation citation . although this technique is unable to provide an assessment of constitutive phosphorylation levels it can provide information on inducible phosphorylation events . mitochondrial protein samples were incubated with _PROTEIN_ and directly compared with samples incubated with _PROTEIN_ and stained with diamond after separation by _PROTEIN_ . a similar pattern was observed with and without _PROTEIN_ except for the signal intensity of a kda mitochondrial protein band which was markedly increased after incubation with _PROTEIN_ . the identity of the kda protein is likely the a previously characterized phosphoprotein whose phosphorylation state is induced under high _PROTEIN_ levels citation citation citation citation . based on these observations additional experiments excluded the incubation step with exogenous _PROTEIN_ so that the basal level of in vivo phosphorylation in plant mitochondria could be fully assessed . to unambiguously identify proteins that were differentially stained by diamond on _PROTEIN_ mitochondrial samples were analyzed in more detail using . mitochondrial proteins were separated by gels and stained with diamond followed by counter staining with colloidal _METHOD_ . two further mitochondrial isolations were undertaken and analyzed by as replicate experiments . overall the pattern of replicate mitochondrial samples was similar with of the most abundant proteins present on the three replicates . some intensity differences were apparent between the most abundant proteins but the pattern is consistent with previous surveys of arabidopsis mitochondria from cell culture citation citation . a comparison of diamond stained proteins with their colloidal _METHOD_ profile indicated minimal diamond staining of abundant mitochondrial proteins . proteins that could be easily identified on the colloidal _METHOD_ gels were analyzed using _METHOD_ . a total of eight spots were selected whose diamond signal was discrete and could be unambiguously mapped to their colloidal _METHOD_ signals . although a number of proteins produced a diffuse diamond signal many were disregarded due to lack of staining intensity inconsistent identifications or contamination when examined by _METHOD_ over replicates . a total of eleven proteins were identified by _METHOD_ . this set included the previously characterized plant mitochondrial phosphoproteins only the two _METHOD_ of the and the _PROTEIN_ . although the energy production machinery represents some of the most abundant proteins within the _LOCATION_ only two components were identified as potential phosphoproteins namely two subunits of succinate dehydrogenase _PROTEIN_ subunit and subunit . both the and the _METHOD_ of glutamate dehydrogenase were identified as well as a group of functionally undetermined mitochondrial proteins a mitochondrial acid _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein a protein a _PROTEIN_ and an unknown protein . all eleven proteins have been previously identified in highly purified mitochondria except for the _PROTEIN_ and the unknown protein although both are strongly predicted to be localized to the _LOCATION_ by multiple targeting prediction _METHOD_ . it should be noted that the _PROTEIN_ subunit and the _PROTEIN_ protein were only found to stain by diamond on two of the three replicates . to detect lower abundant mitochondrial phosphoproteins enrichment strategies prior to separation by were employed . three different phosphoprotein enrichment methods were assessed two were commercially available phosphoprotein techniques from qiagen and invitrogen and the third used moac citation . the three enrichment methods were analyzed by _PROTEIN_ and stained with diamond and then with colloidal _METHOD_ . the eluted protein fractions for all three enrichment methods showed enhanced diamond staining for a number of protein bands when compared with the total mitochondrial protein sample . although the patterns were similar between the three enriched fractions the qiagen fraction displayed a colloidal _METHOD_ pattern that appeared different to the mitochondrial sample . in contrast the total protein patterns of both the invitrogen and moac samples appeared to more closely resemble the starting mitochondrial protein sample . to assess the most abundant proteins from each method _METHOD_ was undertaken on each of the enriched fractions . the empai values produced by mascot _METHOD_ interrogation software were used to estimate the abundance of major proteins in each sample . analysis of these sets indicated that all three methods had _PROTEIN_ a number of phosphoproteins previously identified by and diamond namely the qiagen kit enriched _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ whereas the invitrogen kit enriched _PROTEIN_ and and moac enriched _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gdh and _PROTEIN_ . although both the qiagen and moac methods provided the greatest range of proteins the moac method produced a relatively poor yield from arabidopsis mitochondrial samples consequently the qiagen technique was the selected strategy for further detailed phosphoprotein enrichment . samples from three replicate arabidopsis mitochondrial isolations were processed using the qiagen phosphoprotein purification system . proteins were separated by and stained with diamond and counter stained with colloidal _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ imaging showed a greater number of protein spots stained by diamond when compared with corresponding spots on separations of whole mitochondrial proteins . a comparison of the three replicates identified a number of proteins that were differentially stained by diamond . although many of these were low abundant or identified as proteins a total of nine spots were identified by _METHOD_ as mitochondrial . newly identified phosphoproteins that were enriched included a _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ protease and two _METHOD_ of the protein . phosphoproteins that had been significantly enriched and had also been previously identified using whole mitochondrial samples included _PROTEIN_ proteins and an isoform the unknown protein and an isoform . since the lengthy mitochondrial isolation process may have resulted in reduced phosphorylation different purification methods were employed and analyzed by titanium dioxide chromatography material titansphere . complex lysates comprising mitochondrial proteins were prepared as follows highly purified mitochondrial samples employing two gradients with no phosphatase inhibitors enriched mitochondrial samples employing one gradient and phosphatase inhibitors and organelle pellets rapidly isolated with phosphatase inhibitors . a total of mg protein was used with titansphere and eluates analyzed using _METHOD_ . double enrichment strategies employing initial phosphoprotein enrichments used mg mitochondria and were processed using qiagen invitrogen or moac procedures and eluates analyzed by titansphere and _METHOD_ . although a total of distinct phosphopeptides were identified utilizing these approaches only five were derived from known arabidopsis mitochondrial proteins . this included a phosphopeptide from the _METHOD_ enriched from lysates and a phosphopeptide from _PROTEIN_ ddeeeeek enriched from lysates a phosphopeptide from the _PROTEIN_ protease dsevsdsk enriched from lysates a phosphopeptide from the mitochondrial glycoprotein _PROTEIN_ dee _METHOD_ identified through the double enrichment strategy and lysates and a phosphopeptide from a protein dleeled gek enriched from pellet lysates . raw spectra for all phosphopeptides identified in this study are available for interrogation in the promex spectral reference database citation . the _METHOD_ spectra for each of the five phosphopeptides identified in this study were manually interpreted to ensure validity . these included an unambiguous designation of the modified residue using a diagnostic ion neutral loss of precursor ion and the presence of major b/y ions in the spectra . it should be noted that all five mitochondrial phosphopeptides identified were among the subset of mitochondrial proteins that had reacted to diamond staining further demonstrating that they are genuine phosphopeptides . phosphoproteomic studies of mammalian and yeast mitochondria have recently been reported providing mitochondrial phosphoprotein lists of from mouse liver citation and from yeast citation . a smaller phosphoproteomic study of mitochondrial complex i in bovine heart also showed phosphorylation of five subunits of this complex citation . a comparison of these confirmed phosphoproteins and phosphopeptides from mouse yeast and bovine was undertaken using reciprocal blast against the arabidopsis protein database . although many of the phosphoproteins from mammalian and yeast mitochondria produced significant matches to homologues in arabidopsis only a handful of phosphorylation sites were conserved . these phosphopeptide matches were predominantly from abundant highly conserved mitochondrial proteins subunit of acid dehydrogenase and subunits of _PROTEIN_ synthase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ adp carrier proteins subunit of ligase aldehyde dehydrogenase and isocitrate dehydrogenase . interestingly an analysis of unambiguous phosphoproteins identified from mitochondria thus far indicates a distinct lack of similarity between proteins and phosphorylation sites . only a small subset of mitochondrial phosphoproteins is common between the three mitochondrial phosphoproteomes of mouse citation yeast citation and arabidopsis the is shared by all three the subunit of _PROTEIN_ synthase is shared between mouse and yeast and the _PROTEIN_ between mouse and arabidopsis . although the _PROTEIN_ proteins identified in the mouse phosphoproteome and in this study _PROTEIN_ share similar sites of phosphorylation only the has been shown to unequivocally share the same phosphorylation site yeast and plants .
