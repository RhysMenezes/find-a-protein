salt stress is a detrimental _PROTEIN_ for plant growth and development . the response to salt stress has been shown to involve components in the intracellular trafficking system as well as components of the ubiquitin proteasome system . in this article we have identified in arabidopsis thaliana a little reported ubiquitin ligase involved in salt stress response which we named _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is a member of _PROTEIN_ finger proteins and we demonstrate that it has ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro . we also show that _PROTEIN_ localizes _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and at the intracellular endosomes . loss of function mutant seedlings exhibit accelerated endocytosis in roots and have altered _PROTEIN_ of several genes involved in the _LOCATION_ trafficking system . moreover protein trafficking inhibitor brefeldin a treatment has increased bfa bodies in mutant . this mutant also showed increased tolerance to salt ionic and osmotic stresses reduced accumulation of reactive oxygen species during salt stress and increased _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ which encodes a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase involved in production . we conclude that _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ trafficking related ubiquitin ligase which helps the plant to respond to salt stress by monitoring intracellular _LOCATION_ trafficking and reactive oxygen species production .
in order to isolate novel ligases of the _PROTEIN_ finger family involved in the response to salt stress we screened a pool of ac ds arabidopsis insertion lines in _PROTEIN_ finger genes . a collection of mutant lines and its relative wild type was sown in _METHOD_ containing mm nacl . salt resistant seedlings were transferred to soil and their offspring was scored again for the salt resistant phenotype on a higher salt concentration . here we describe the characterization of one of these salt resistant mutants that we named _PROTEIN_ . in order to remove possible extraneous mutations we backcrossed the mutant line to the wt . analysis of the segregation rate of the population on kanamycin after the backcross indicated that the results were consistent with a resistant sensitive seedlings ratio of thus indicating a single transposon insertion . tail pcr and blast results confirmed that the ds element was inserted in the coding region of the _GENE_ gene bp downstream of the _PROTEIN_ . rt pcr experiments revealed that the full length _PROTEIN_ mrna was absent in the mutant . because no other _PROTEIN_ insertion mutants could be recovered from all available t dna insertion collections to further confirm that the phenotype was due to the absence of a full length _PROTEIN_ mrna we transformed plants with a construct overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . among the obtained independent lines some lines showed a significant increase in _PROTEIN_ mrna levels and and homozygous progeny was used for phenotypical analyses . when grown on mm nacl ox _PROTEIN_ seedlings not only showed complementation of the salt sensitive phenotype but were even more sensitive to salt stress probably due to _PROTEIN_ overexpression . taken together these results indicate that the phenotype of the mutant is indeed caused by a single knockout insertion in the _PROTEIN_ gene . when ox _PROTEIN_ and their relative wt seeds were germinated on mm nacl differences could be observed already in the seed germination rate . at days post germination seeds of the mutant were germinated while only seedlings were germinated for the wt . as for ox _PROTEIN_ seedlings only were able to germinate . this result indicated _PROTEIN_ could be a negative regulator in salt tolerance . in order to further analyze the salt response in seedlings lacking or overexpressing _PROTEIN_ we measured cotyledon greening rate in ox _PROTEIN_ and their relative wt after days of growth on medium containing mm nacl . the percentage of green cotyledons was for for the wt and only for ox _PROTEIN_ seedlings . these results suggest that altered levels of _PROTEIN_ affect salt response in _METHOD_ of cotyledons greening . high salt concentrations causes hyperosmotic and ionic stress . to ascertain whether the salt tolerance in depended on the ionic or on the osmotic components of the nacl stress ox _PROTEIN_ and their relative wt seedlings were grown in the presence or absence of mm mannitol whose osmotic effect is comparable with a mm nacl concentration . the mutant was more resistant than the wt in _METHOD_ both of germination rate and of cotyledon greening to mannitol . in contrast ox _PROTEIN_ seedlings were more sensitive than the wt as measured by their germination rate and their fresh weight . these results suggested that the _PROTEIN_ gene is involved both in the ionic and osmotic response to salt stress . the _PROTEIN_ gene encodes a protein of amino acids with a predicted molecular _METHOD_ of kilodaltons and which contains two domains a transmembrane domain and a _PROTEIN_ domain encompassing aa and aa respectively as predicted by the smart program . the _PROTEIN_ domain includes six highly conserved cysteines two histidine residues and is composed of two zinc finger motifs . this suggests that _PROTEIN_ could have ligase activity . previous genome wide studies had annotated _PROTEIN_ as _PROTEIN_ a member of _PROTEIN_ family . all members of the _PROTEIN_ family contain a _PROTEIN_ finger domain . indeed up to now three members of the _PROTEIN_ family _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have been shown to be active ligases in arabidopsis . to test whether _PROTEIN_ also has ubiquitin ligase activity we carried out an in vitro ubiquitination assay . to this aim we _PROTEIN_ and purified the full length of _PROTEIN_ with mbp tag from escherichia coli and tested its self ubiquitination activity by incubating it with wheat human and his tagged ubiquitin followed by immunoblot analysis . while in the absence of or no polyubiquitination conjugates could be observed clear poly ubiquitinated mbp _PROTEIN_ conjugates could be observed when all reagents were present . the result was double confirmed by anti ub and anti mbp _PROTEIN_ antibodies . this result indicates that _PROTEIN_ is a functional ligase in vitro and that it is dependent on and activity . as already described _PROTEIN_ contains a putative transmembrane domain at its n terminus suggesting that _PROTEIN_ might be a _LOCATION_ protein . in order to prove this hypothesis we sought to determine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ by transiently overexpressing a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein in leaf cells via agroinfiltration . the activity of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was verified by transform _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to to assay on the salt sensitivity . after days from the inoculation n. benthamiana leaves were subjected to subcellular fractionation and the presence of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was verified by immunoblot analysis . as shown in figure a full size _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was detected only in the pellet fraction when proteins were extracted with a detergent free buffer while it was detected in soluble fraction when proteins were extracted with a buffer containing triton x . these results suggested that _PROTEIN_ likely associates with the cellular _LOCATION_ system . to further determine which sub type of _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ protein was localized to n. benthamiana leaf cells transiently _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ fusion protein were incubated with the lipophilic styryl dye which is known to stain endosomes and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in arabidopsis under low temperature and observed under a confocal microscope . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but also co localized with small _LOCATION_ particles . the same particles were also stained with suggesting that _PROTEIN_ likely localizes to intracellular endosomes . to further substantiate this subcellular localization pattern we co _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and several markers of different subcellular compartments in arabidopsis protoplast cells . the results are shown in figure and indicate that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ subcellular localization was mostly identical to that of mcherry which is a cis _LOCATION_ vesicle marker . a similar co localization was also found between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the _METHOD_ tagged tgn/ee _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ . we also detected an overlapping subcellular distribution between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ marker which marks the pre _LOCATION_ compartments . these results indicated that _PROTEIN_ localizes to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ the _LOCATION_ apparatus and the pvcs and suggest that _PROTEIN_ might participate in salt stress response by regulating _LOCATION_ trafficking . to test whether _PROTEIN_ has a role in _LOCATION_ trafficking we monitored the internalization levels of in root cells of the mutant ox _PROTEIN_ and of wt seedlings treated or not with nacl and mannitol . the results indicate that accumulation of in the mutant was already higher than in the wt under standard growth condition but that it increased even more significantly after treatment with mm nacl and mm mannitol . moreover the response of ox _PROTEIN_ plants in the uptake assays is similar to wt either in normal condition or salt stress condition . this suggests that nacl and mannitol accelerates endocytosis of already in the wt and to a higher extent in the mutant . in order to further support the _PROTEIN_ involved in _LOCATION_ trafficking we examined the effect of protein trafficking inhibitor brefeldin a in root cells of the mutant ox _PROTEIN_ and of wt seedlings . the results showed that bfa compartments were increased in mutant when compared with ox _PROTEIN_ and of wt seedlings . all these results indicated that _PROTEIN_ participated in _LOCATION_ trafficking . we further confirmed the effect of _PROTEIN_ on _LOCATION_ trafficking by monitoring its effects on the _PROTEIN_ of genes encoding components of the _LOCATION_ trafficking system . more than genes affecting _LOCATION_ trafficking had been identified in arabidopsis among those we decided to monitor by qrt pcr the _PROTEIN_ of several those genes which have been found to be involved in salt stress response _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ whose _PROTEIN_ is induced by salt stress _PROTEIN_ which encodes a member of the rab family of small _PROTEIN_ and plays a role in _LOCATION_ identification vesicle targeting specificity as well as in salt stress response _PROTEIN_ encoding a syntaxin which participates in _LOCATION_ fusion and in osmotic and salt stress response _PROTEIN_ encoding a kinase involved in endocytosis as well as in salt stress response . the _PROTEIN_ of these four genes was assessed in seedlings treated or not with mm nacl for increasing times and compared with their levels in the wt . the results are shown in figure and indicate that while _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was slightly but significantly higher in than in the wt the addition of salt progressively reduced this difference which was completely lost after h of incubation . a similar _PROTEIN_ profile was observed for the _PROTEIN_ gene . these results indicate that loss of _PROTEIN_ affects the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ under standard growth condition but not at the last stage of salt treatment . on the contrary the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ did not significantly increase upon nacl treatment in the wt or in . as for _PROTEIN_ its _PROTEIN_ did not show any significant difference between the wt and in any growth conditions . in order to further clarify _PROTEIN_ function in _LOCATION_ trafficking we examined the phenotype of _PROTEIN_ double mutant on salt stress . because of the different ecotypes of _PROTEIN_ and mutants we adopted the microrna technology to generate the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant in the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . the results showed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants are sensitive to salt stress which mimic to _PROTEIN_ mutant plants under same condition . taken together these results indicated that _PROTEIN_ might regulate the _PROTEIN_ level of only a subset of endocytosis and _LOCATION_ trafficking genes . at least one of possibility is that _PROTEIN_ functions in regulating _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to respond to salt stress . one of the major effects of many abiotic stresses including salt is the development of an oxidative stress and the production of ros . it has been demonstrated that some _LOCATION_ trafficking genes which are also involved in salt stress response can cause changes in ros production . for example _PROTEIN_ overexpression in arabidopsis leads to increased tolerance to salt stress and to reduced ros accumulation while _PROTEIN_ was shown to coordinate the production of ros that occurs during salt stress . the salt tolerant phenotype of prompted us to hypothesize that ros levels might be altered in this mutant . to verify this hypothesis we monitored levels in and wt seedlings by staining the seedlings with diaminobenzidine . the results are reported in figure and show that seedlings produced considerably less ros if compared with the wt upon nacl induction while no detectable difference was observed in seedlings grown in control conditions . high salt is known to induce the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ which encode a _LOCATION_ bound nadph oxidase involved in production . thus we monitored the levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in and wt seedlings by qrt pcr . our results show that the _PROTEIN_ transcript was significantly down regulated in the mutant if compared with the wt after h and h of salt treatment . taken together these results suggested that _PROTEIN_ might be involved in salt induced ros production through the regulation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ .
