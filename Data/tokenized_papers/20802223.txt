cytokinesis is regulated to ensure the precise partitioning of cytoplasm and duplicated chromosomes to daughter cells . the nack pqr pathway which includes _PROTEIN_ kinesin like protein and a mitogen activated protein kinase cascade plays a key role in cytokinesis in tobacco cells . although _PROTEIN_ klp _PROTEIN_ map kinase kinase kinases and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ map kinase kinase have been identified independently as regulators of cytokinesis in arabidopsis thaliana the involvement of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in a regulatory cascade remains to be demonstrated . here we provide details of the protein kinase pathway that controls cytokinesis in a. thaliana . analysis of the subcellular distribution of six mapkks of a. thaliana that had been fused to green _METHOD_ protein revealed that only _PROTEIN_ protein was concentrated at the equatorial plane of the phragmoplast at the site of localization of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in yeast cells replaced the growth control function of the mapkk encoded by yeast _PROTEIN_ provided that both _PROTEIN_ mapkkk and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ klp were coexpressed suggesting that _PROTEIN_ activates _PROTEIN_ in the presence of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . coexpression of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ weakly activated _PROTEIN_ but that of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ did not . _PROTEIN_ phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ mapk in vitro to activate the latter kinase . thus cytokinesis in a. thaliana is controlled by a pathway that consists of _PROTEIN_ mapkkks that can be activated by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mapkk with _PROTEIN_ mapk being a probable target of _PROTEIN_ .
in a previous study by the _PROTEIN_ mutation did not appear to be a null allele . therefore in the present study we used two recently isolated new alleles of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ allele on the col ecotype background corresponded to the _PROTEIN_ gene with a t dna in the fourth exon which disrupted kinase subdomain iv . analysis by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction with a pair of primers that spanned the insertion failed to detect the relevant transcript in _PROTEIN_ plants . thus this allele most likely corresponds to a null mutation and therefore we used it in this study as a representative _PROTEIN_ mutant allele . homozygous _PROTEIN_ plants exhibited severe dwarfism with typical defects in cytokinesis and most homozygous mutants stopped growing before bolting occurred . growth was restored by a transgene that included _PROTEIN_ cdna . fig . dwarf phenotype of _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . schematic illustration of the structure

between an _PROTEIN_ heterozygote and a wild type parent . when we used mutant pollen from a heterozygous _PROTEIN_ parent for crosses with a wild type female parent mutant alleles were transmitted to approximately of the offspring as expected indicating that male gametophytes with an _PROTEIN_ single mutation were viable . however when we pollinated heterozygous parents with pollen from wild type plants only of offspring contained the _PROTEIN_ allele which must have been derived from female gametes . these results suggested that approximately of female gametes with the _PROTEIN_ mutation were not viable in heterozygous plants . we also used the _PROTEIN_ allele on the landsberg _LOCATION_ ecotype background . in this mutant allele the ds transposon was integrated into the third exon of the _PROTEIN_ gene resulting in a duplication of eight nucleotides upstream of the kinase domain . we did not detect a transcript that spanned the integration site in _PROTEIN_ plants thus this allele also probably corresponds to a null _PROTEIN_ mutation . homozygous _PROTEIN_ plants exhibited severe defects in growth and cytokinesis . the arabidopsis genome genes for mapkks _PROTEIN_ . we examined the levels of transcripts of each of these genes in mature leaves shoot apices and flowers . we failed to detect transcripts of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ by rt pcr . levels of the _PROTEIN_ transcript were also relatively low in mature leaves . next we analyzed the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ by quantitative real time rt pcr . the transcript of _PROTEIN_ accumulated at much higher levels in shoot apices and flowers than in mature leaves as did transcripts of cyclin _PROTEIN_ indicating that these tissues are rich in proliferating cells . fig . of genes for mapkks in a. thaliana . quantitative rt pcr was performed to determine the levels of transcripts of genes for mapkks in mature leaves shoot apices and flowers

for tubulin and are shown relative to the values obtained from mature leaves . as noted above two kinesin like proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and the mapkkks _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which are homologs of tobacco are required for cytokinesis in a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in the tobacco by system _PROTEIN_ binds to _PROTEIN_ to activate the _PROTEIN_ which activates mapkk . in the present study we examined the relationships among these _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in a. thaliana . to investigate these relationships we used one of the modules in the mapk cascades of saccharomyces cerevisiae . the chosen module includes the _PROTEIN_ mapkk and the _PROTEIN_ mapk which function in the osmosensing mapk cascade . yeast cells with the _PROTEIN_ mutation can not grow under high osmolarity conditions . if _PROTEIN_ were to activate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ would then be expected to grow under these restrictive conditions . to test this hypothesis we fused _PROTEIN_ cdna to the galactose inducible promoter of the _PROTEIN_ gene from yeast and introduced the fusion construct into _PROTEIN_ mutant cells . we also made chimeric genes for the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ cdna and _PROTEIN_ cdna using the constitutively active promoters of the gap gene from yeast . as shown in _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ cdna did not confer osmotolerance on _PROTEIN_ mutant cells even in the presence of galactose when the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fusion genes were absent from _PROTEIN_ cells . however when _PROTEIN_ cdna was coexpressed with both the _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ fusions _PROTEIN_ cells were able to grow at elevated osmolarity . thus _PROTEIN_ required _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for suppression of the osmosensitive phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . fig . of the osmosensitive growth defects of yeast _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . schematic illustration of the basis for the experiment with the yeast _PROTEIN_ mutant in which we examined the activation of _PROTEIN_ exploiting the osmoregulatory pathway in s. cerevisiae . osmotic signals activate the mapkkks and _PROTEIN_ which in turn activate the _PROTEIN_ mapk via the _PROTEIN_ mapkk _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we used yeast _PROTEIN_ cells which lack _PROTEIN_ and can not grow under high osmolarity conditions . if a plant mapkk such as _PROTEIN_ was able to activate _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ cells the cells were able to grow under high osmolarity conditions . the _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ mutants were transformed with various combinations of plasmids that harbored cdnas for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ or with the corresponding empty vectors . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was driven by a galactose inducible promoter . transformants were grown on plates that were supplemented either with _PROTEIN_ but no sorbitol or with galactose plus m sorbitol at for days . the two arcs in indicate yeast cells that grew under high osmolarity conditions . serial fold dilutions of cultures of

growth under high osmolarity conditions respectively . vector indicates the corresponding empty vector . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ include putative motor domains in the amino terminal halves and stalk domains in the _PROTEIN_ terminal halves and the stalk domain _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is by itself sufficient for the activation of _PROTEIN_ . we examined the effect of the stalk domain of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in a similar set of experiments . our results indicated that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was able to replace intact _PROTEIN_ in this assay . we examined whether the _PROTEIN_ gene which encodes a mapk that acts downstream of _PROTEIN_ might be required for the suppression of the osmosensitive phenotype of _PROTEIN_ cells by _PROTEIN_ of the combination of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cdnas in the _PROTEIN_ mutant yeast cells . show that even when all three constructs were _PROTEIN_ together they did not suppress the osmosensitive phenotype of _PROTEIN_ cells indicating that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ stimulate yeast growth through the function of _PROTEIN_ map kinase . although the predicted amino acid sequences of tobacco _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are very similar _PROTEIN_ is rather different from other members of the _PROTEIN_ family _PROTEIN_ . in addition the amino acid sequence of the _PROTEIN_ terminal region of tobacco is required for the interaction of with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ terminal region of _PROTEIN_ exhibits a low similarity in _METHOD_ of amino acid sequences to those of other members although corresponding regions of other members show higher similarities . we examined the effects of _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ separately and together on the activation of _PROTEIN_ in yeast cells . coexpression of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ only weakly supported the growth of _PROTEIN_ cells under high osmolarity conditions . the weak suppression depended on the presence of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . we also examined the effect of tetraspore _PROTEIN_ klp which is an arabidopsis ortholog of tobacco _PROTEIN_ on the activation of _PROTEIN_ . since we were unable to obtain transformed yeast cells when we introduced full length _PROTEIN_ cdna into the _PROTEIN_ vector we tested the effect of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ yeast _PROTEIN_ cells that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with the combination of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plus _PROTEIN_ were able to grow under high osmolarity conditions with growth depending on the presence of both _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . experiments with serial dilutions of transformants showed that the osmotolerance of _PROTEIN_ cells that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cdna was weaker than that of _PROTEIN_ cells that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cdna . coexpression of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cdnas did not confer osmotolerance on _PROTEIN_ cells under the conditions of our assays . on the basis of the previous results we postulated that _PROTEIN_ might be activated by _PROTEIN_ and that activity might be increased by the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ yeast cells . our data also suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ might be weak activators of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . _PROTEIN_ did not activate _PROTEIN_ . we generated a cdna that encoded green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fused to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . we introduced the fusion gene into _PROTEIN_ mutant plants and we confirmed that the mutant phenotype was rescued by this construct . moreover we were able to detect _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ at the putative plane of division of root cells . hoechst staining revealed that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was localized between the two sets of daughter chromosomes at sites that appeared to correspond to the plane of division of the root cells . fig . localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . complementation of the

_METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in greater detail using cultured tobacco by cells . at telophase _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was localized at the equatorial plane of the phragmoplast and colocalized with fm stained cell plates . confocal microscopy revealed that _METHOD_ due to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ had a _PROTEIN_ like profile . time lapse analysis demonstrated moreover that the _PROTEIN_ like profile expanded centrifugally over time . we examined the localization of five other mapkks _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis in by cells using _METHOD_ fused derivatives . none of them was localized similarly to the _PROTEIN_ fusion protein . thus _PROTEIN_ appeared to be the only mapkk of arabidopsis that is localized in the equatorial region of the phragmoplast . there are genes for mapks in the arabidopsis genome _PROTEIN_ . we tested five mapks in group b _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ for phosphorylation and activation by _PROTEIN_ in vitro . we also examined one member of group c _PROTEIN_ and one member of group a _PROTEIN_ for activation in vitro . we generated _PROTEIN_ fused _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli cells because the _PROTEIN_ fused efficiently phosphorylates _PROTEIN_ mapk for reasons unknown . we examined whether _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was able to phosphorylate the inactive form of each mapk mentioned above . in vitro _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ but failed to phosphorylate other mapks in group b . _PROTEIN_ was also phosphorylated but at a very low level . in gel kinase assays revealed that wild type _PROTEIN_ that had been phosphorylated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ phosphorylated mbp efficiently . in contrast we failed to detect the activity of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in vitro .

proteins gels were incubated with _PROTEIN_ . the upper panel shows the autoradiograph and the lower panel shows the results of immunoblotting with specific antibodies . we searched for mapks in group b that were able to interact with _PROTEIN_ using the yeast two hybrid system . we fused five cdnas for group b mapks individually to the sequence of the lexa dna binding domain and coexpressed each of them with _PROTEIN_ cdna that had been fused to the dna sequence that encodes the activation domain _PROTEIN_ . yeast cells _PROTEIN_ lexa _PROTEIN_ and lexa _PROTEIN_ were able to proliferate under restrictive conditions with concomitant coexpression of _PROTEIN_ in the presence of and mm amino triazol respectively . since yeast cells _PROTEIN_ lexa _PROTEIN_ or lexa _PROTEIN_ were able to grow on plates prepared with mm irrespective of the presence or absence of _PROTEIN_ we also examined interactions between each fused mapk and lexa _PROTEIN_ . we observed the efficient growth of yeast cells that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ under restrictive conditions with and mm respectively only when lexa _PROTEIN_ was also _PROTEIN_ . these results demonstrated that _PROTEIN_
