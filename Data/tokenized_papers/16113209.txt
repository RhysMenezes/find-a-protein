_LOCATION_ perform diverse and vital functions in eukaryotes and abnormalities in peroxisomal function lead to severe developmental disorders in humans . _LOCATION_ are also involved in a wide array of physiological and metabolic functions unique to plants yet many aspects of this important organelle are poorly understood . in yeast and mammals various steps in _LOCATION_ biogenesis require the function of peroxin proteins among which _PROTEIN_ is a _PROTEIN_ finger peroxisomal _LOCATION_ protein involved in the import of _PROTEIN_ proteins . to investigate the role of _PROTEIN_ in plants we identified a t dna knockout allele of _PROTEIN_ and generated partial loss of function _PROTEIN_ mutants using rna interference . we show that _PROTEIN_ null mutants are developmentally arrested during early embryogenesis and that the embryo lethal phenotype can be rescued by overexpression of the _PROTEIN_ cyan _METHOD_ protein fusion protein which targets to the _LOCATION_ . using virus induced gene silencing techniques we demonstrate that peroxisomal number and _METHOD_ of the yellow _METHOD_ protein _LOCATION_ targeting signal type protein are greatly reduced when _PROTEIN_ is silenced . rna interference plants with partial reduction of the _PROTEIN_ transcript exhibit impaired _LOCATION_ biogenesis and function inhibition of plant growth and reduced fertility . our work provides evidence that the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ protein is required for _LOCATION_ biogenesis and plays an essential role throughout plant development .
_PROTEIN_ is a single copy gene encoding a putative protein of kd . it shares approximately protein sequence identity with its yeast and mammalian orthologs and contains a type _PROTEIN_ finger motif with five conserved cys which is different from the type _PROTEIN_ found in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . to study the function of _PROTEIN_ in plant development we first identified from the salk arabidopsis t dna knockout collection a line containing a t dna insertion in the sixth exon of _PROTEIN_ . we were unable to identify plants homozygous for the insertion after screening more than progeny from heterozygous plants . immature siliques of wild type plants contained green seeds that turned brown at maturity and occasionally one or two aborted seeds . however immature siliques from heterozygous plants had approximately white seeds which became purplish and shriveled as the siliques matured . these data suggest that the _PROTEIN_ insertion allele is segregating as a single recessive mutation which may confer embryonic lethality in homozygotes . to confirm that the abnormal embryos indeed were homozygous for the t dna insertion allele we dissected both abnormal and normal embryos from the seeds and pooled approximately embryos of each type for dna extraction . pcr analysis demonstrated that normal embryos contained both the insertion and the wild type alleles suggesting that they were composed of both wild type and heterozygous embryos . however only the t dna insertion specific band was amplified from the abnormal embryos indicating that these embryos were homozygous knockouts . to determine which step of embryo development was disrupted by the _PROTEIN_ null mutation we analyzed developing seeds in heterozygous plants using nomarski optics . knockout embryos of _PROTEIN_ showed retarded growth and in most cases were able to develop to the heart stage but failed to grow further into torpedo and mature embryos . occasionally the mutant embryos ceased to grow at globular or early torpedo stage . our data suggest that homozygous _PROTEIN_ null embryos were delayed in growth and eventually stopped developing during early stages of embryogenesis . we performed electron microscopic analysis with the knockout embryos to determine the effect of _PROTEIN_ deficiency at the ultrastructural level . embryos subjected to examination were from heterozygous plants d after fertilization when wild type embryos are usually at the torpedo stage of embryogenesis . wild type embryos contained well developed _LOCATION_ lipid bodies and _LOCATION_ . the _PROTEIN_ null embryos however lacked _LOCATION_ contained small and underdeveloped _LOCATION_ and were missing characteristic lipid body structures . based on these observations we conclude that _PROTEIN_ is required at least for the formation of the _LOCATION_ . the impairment of other subcellular structures such as lipid bodies and _LOCATION_ could be an indirect consequence of the loss of _PROTEIN_ . for example lipid bodies are physically associated with _LOCATION_ during seed germination providing them with fatty acid substrates . it is thus conceivable that the function and presence of lipid bodies can be affected by a feedback mechanism when no functional _LOCATION_ are present to carry out lipid metabolism however a direct role of _PROTEIN_ in lipid body formation can not be completely ruled out . to determine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ we analyzed wild type arabidopsis plants coexpressing yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ targeting signal type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ by _METHOD_ microscopy . _PROTEIN_ which is composed of ser lys and leu is widely used as a tag to localize proteins to the _LOCATION_ in diverse _METHOD_ . it is the targeting sequence for the majority of known peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ proteins and is recognized by the _PROTEIN_ receptor _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ displayed a punctate pattern of _METHOD_ which is typical for _LOCATION_ and was colocalized with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is also peroxisomal in arabidopsis . we also transformed plants heterozygous for the knockout allele with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion construct driven by the constitutive promoter . plants were screened for homozygosity for the _PROTEIN_ knockout allele and overexpression of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein . the embryo lethal phenotype of the knockout plants was rescued by the transgene providing further evidence that the lack of a functional _PROTEIN_ gene was responsible for the lethal phenotype and suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein functions properly . the embryo lethal phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ knockout plants prevented us from further elucidating the potential roles of _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ biogenesis and in _PROTEIN_ stages of development thus mutants with reduced levels of _PROTEIN_ were needed . to this end two rnai strategies were employed to knock down the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ infecting plants with viruses containing a fragment of the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence and making transgenic plants stably _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ double stranded rnai construct . a gene silencing system based on the bipartite geminivirus cabbage leaf curl virus was recently developed that can efficiently induce diffusible homology based systemic silencing of endogenous genes in arabidopsis . this system is composed of two small circular viral dna genomes cblcv a and cblcv b . to attenuate the viral symptom the coat protein encoding _PROTEIN_ gene was deleted from the a genome and replaced by a fragment of the gene to be silenced . the b genome carries the movement protein for systemic infection . to silence the _PROTEIN_ gene a bp cdna fragment of _PROTEIN_ was cloned into the cblcv a vector in sense or antisense orientation . viruses containing the silencing constructs were bombarded into arabidopsis plants in the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ background . leaf tissue from infected plants was observed under the _METHOD_ microscope to weeks after bombardment when genes encoded by the viruses are _PROTEIN_ at high levels in new leaves . as a control we also bombarded some plants with viruses containing the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gene . _PROTEIN_ encodes the small subunit of the chloroplast magnesium chelatase and confers an albino phenotype when silenced owing to the lack of chlorophyll production . this control is used as an indicator for _METHOD_ viral replication and systemic movement and therefore serves as a guide to determine the time for rna and _METHOD_ microscopic analyses . plants infected by both the sense and antisense _PROTEIN_ silencing constructs exhibited a strong reduction in the number of _LOCATION_ as well as peroxisomal _METHOD_ of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein in new leaves compared to old leaves whereas plants infected by the empty vector control did not show a significant difference between old and new leaf tissue . reverse transcriptase pcr analysis was subsequently performed to determine the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ in these tissues . figure shows that in plants bombarded with the _PROTEIN_ silencing constructs the transcript level of _PROTEIN_ in the new tissue was significantly lower than in the old tissue suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is required for _LOCATION_ biogenesis in leaves . despite the _PROTEIN_ that the cblcv virus used in this work was attenuated by removal of the _PROTEIN_ gene plants still displayed mild viral _METHOD_ after infection such as wrinkled leaves stunted growth and lack of inflorescence . as such the mutant phenotypes caused by _PROTEIN_ silencing in adult plants could not be unambiguously determined by this approach . to elucidate more clearly the impact of _PROTEIN_ on plant development a second rnai approach was performed simultaneously . given the lethal phenotype of the null mutants we aimed to generate weaker and partial loss of function mutants of _PROTEIN_ by using a smaller fragment of the gene rather than the entire coding region in the rnai construct . the same bp cdna fragment of _PROTEIN_ was cloned as inverted repeats into the dsrnai vector obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center _PROTEIN_ . plants containing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were transformed with the derived _PROTEIN_ silencing construct under the control of the promoter . approximately of the transgenic plants showed fairly strong reduction of the _PROTEIN_ mrna . the level of _PROTEIN_ suppression correlated with the severity of the mutant phenotypes in both plants and their progeny . compared with wild type plants and rnai plants with a subtle reduction of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ rnai plants with stronger reduction of _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ were smaller and paler green and developed more slowly . the mutants were also less fertile with smaller gynoecia and shorter stamens in many mutant flowers and contained reduced numbers of _LOCATION_ and significantly weakened _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in _LOCATION_ . we also tested sugar dependence and indole butyric acid response of the rnai plants . through oxidation and the glyoxylate cycle oilseed _LOCATION_ participate in lipid mobilization which provides seedlings with energy to grow . as such peroxisomal mutant seedlings of oilseed species such as arabidopsis usually grow poorly in the absence of exogenous sugar . mutants defective in oxidation are also resistant to the inhibitory effect of iba on root elongation because mutant _LOCATION_ can not efficiently convert iba into iaa inside this organelle . seeds were plated on medium with or without suc and on medium containing iba combined with suc root length was measured after d of growth in the light . rnai plants numbers and exhibited defects in root elongation without supplemental sugar a phenotype that was mostly rescued by suc . in addition these mutants were also less responsive to iba which is indicative of a deficiency in oxidation . taken together our data support the role of _PROTEIN_ as a critical player in _LOCATION_ formation and function and in plant vegetative and reproductive growth . the essential role of _PROTEIN_ throughout arabidopsis development led us to examine its _PROTEIN_ pattern in the plant . an rt pcr analysis of the _PROTEIN_ transcript suggested that this gene was ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ in young seedlings leaves roots and flowers . to assess its _PROTEIN_ more completely we used genevestigator an arabidopsis microarray gene _PROTEIN_ database and analysis toolbox to search for _PROTEIN_ of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ gene in various organs and at several developmental stages . the microarray data based on experiments with the arabidopsis full genome _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ arrays showed that _PROTEIN_ was ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ and that its _PROTEIN_ pattern correlated well with several other genes known to be required for _LOCATION_ biogenesis including the other two _PROTEIN_ peroxin genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . consistent with their essential role in embryogenesis all the three _PROTEIN_ peroxins were most highly _PROTEIN_ in seeds . the transcript levels of these genes were also high during germination when _LOCATION_ are needed for lipid metabolism and in senescent plants in which leaf _LOCATION_ are transformed into glyoxysomes to convert _LOCATION_ lipids into _PROTEIN_ . all three pex genes were also abundant in floral structures namely inflorescences carpels and pedicels and at the stage when flowering is complete and siliques are formed . these data are also in agreement with results from our study which showed that flower formation and fertility were impaired when the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was strongly reduced in arabidopsis . interestingly these three pex genes were also strongly _PROTEIN_ in the shoot apex where a specific function for _LOCATION_ has not been established underlying their possible fundamental roles in this tissue .
arabidopsis plants used in this study are of the columbia background . seeds were germinated on murashige and skoog medium with or without suc iba and appropriate antibiotics when necessary . plants used for most experiments were grown with h photoperiod under to light conditions at . plants used for bombardment in virus induced gene silencing were grown in the same light intensity and temperature in short day conditions with an h photoperiod . pcr was performed with genomic dna using taq dna polymerase and conditions suggested by the manufacturer . the primers were as follows left border from the t dna vector gcgtggaccgcttgctgcaact from intron and exon _PROTEIN_ and from exon ggagggtacactgttggagctgataatctc . and amplify a bp product from the wild type allele . lb and amplify an insertion specific product of bp . an approximately bp piece of dna of unknown origin was also found at the insertion site between the t dna and the _PROTEIN_ genomic dna . a leica dissecting microscope was used to observe siliques and floral structures and a zeiss axiophot microscope was used for nomarski optics of seeds . for nomarski optics fresh siliques harvested to d after pollination were dissected . developing seeds were treated with clearing solution containing chloral hydrate water glycerol and cleared for to h at room temperature or overnight at . a zeiss axiophot microscope was used to visualize _METHOD_ proteins . for in vivo detection of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ leaf tissue was mounted in water and viewed with a _METHOD_ filter or a _METHOD_ filter . abnormal and normal seeds from the same silique were fixed separately in glutaraldehyde m phosphate buffer ph at room temperature for h followed by a secondary fixation in in the same buffer . samples were dehydrated in a graded series of acetone and embedded in spurr 's epoxy resin . ultrathin sections were cut by a mt x ultramicrotome stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and observed under a jem ii transmission electron microscope . to make _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ a _METHOD_ ser lys leu fragment was amplified by pcr from the vector _METHOD_ peroxi _PROTEIN_ and cloned into a vector derived from and containing the promoter . to clone _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the coding region of _PROTEIN_ was first amplified by rt pcr from first strand cdna made from wild type col seedling mrna using primers _GENE_ and _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ . the resulting pcr fragment was then cloned into bamhi and sali sites at the amino terminus of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in a binary vector derived from and containing the promoter . to clone the _PROTEIN_ rnai construct the arabidopsis vector for dsrna production was obtained from _PROTEIN_ . a bp fragment of _PROTEIN_ cdna was amplified by pcr using primers _PROTEIN_ and . the pcr product was digested with asci and swai and ligated into to generate plasmid _PROTEIN_ . the same pcr product was digested again with bamhi and xbai and ligated into _PROTEIN_ to generate plasmid _PROTEIN_ . as a result the _PROTEIN_ plasmid has a copy of the bp fragment inserted into asci to swai sites and an inverted repeat of the fragment inserted into bamhi to xbai sites . all pcr amplifications were carried out using pfu dna polymerase and protocols suggested by the manufacturer . agrobacterium mediated transformation of arabidopsis plants was performed using the floral dip method . transgenic plants were selected on murashige and skoog plates containing kanamycin for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ gentamycin for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ rnai . a bp

bp fragment was also generated by pcr using primers and _PROTEIN_ . the pcr product was digested with xbai and bglii and cloned into the vector to generate plasmid . arabidopsis plants in the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ background were grown in individual pots in short day conditions and bombarded with an equal amount of each silencing construct dna and the dna as described in a previous study . each plant was bombarded at the age of to weeks old according to the protocol provided by citation . two to three plants were bombarded with each construct . the experiment was repeated three times . old and new leaf tissue was collected separately from infected plants approximately weeks after bombardment . new leaves were those from around the center of the rosette that emerged after bombardment and the old leaves were older rosette leaves that were present at the time of the bombardment . because of the distinct colors of silenced and nonsilenced leaves the _PROTEIN_ infected plants served as a guide to distinguish new from old tissue for microscopic and rt pcr characterizations . total rna was extracted with _PROTEIN_ reagent and subjected to reverse transcription reaction . the _PROTEIN_ specific primers _PROTEIN_ from exon and _PROTEIN_ from exon amplify a bp product from _PROTEIN_ cdna . the ubiquitin specific primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from the gene amplify a cdna product of
