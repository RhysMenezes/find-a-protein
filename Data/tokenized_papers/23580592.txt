the phytohormone auxin regulates virtually every aspect of plant development . to identify new genes involved in auxin activity a genetic screen was performed for arabidopsis mutants with altered _PROTEIN_ of the auxin responsive reporter _METHOD_ . one of the mutants recovered in the screen designated as weak auxin _PROTEIN_ exhibits much lower _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ when treated with the synthetic auxin dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and displays severe defects in root development . the _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ auxin transport and results in a disruption of the asymmetric auxin distribution . the levels of the auxin transporters and _PROTEIN_ formed are dramatically reduced in the _PROTEIN_ root tip . molecular analyses demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is root _PROTEIN_ b _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a member of the conserved domain of unknown protein family found in diverse eukaryotic _METHOD_ . our data suggest that _PROTEIN_ plays an essential role in the regulation of _PROTEIN_ auxin transport by _PROTEIN_ the proper level of auxin transporters on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ .
to identify new genes affecting auxin response approximately transgenic seeds _METHOD_ were mutagenized with ethyl methanesulfonate and the population was screened for mutants with altered _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ in the root . a number of mutants with a shorter primary root and reduced _METHOD_ signal upon auxin treatment were isolated . one of these mutants called _PROTEIN_ was further characterized . segregation analysis revealed that _PROTEIN_ behaves as a recessive mutation . the _PROTEIN_ mutant displays much lower levels of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ after treatment with the synthetic auxin dichlorophenoxyacetic acid . six day old _PROTEIN_ seedlings treated with nm d overnight do not exhibit an increase in _METHOD_ signal in the root apex . in contrast _METHOD_ signal increases dramatically in the control line . meanwhile the _PROTEIN_ mutant has severe defects in root development . ten day old _PROTEIN_ seedlings display extremely shorter primary roots shorter hypocotyl length smaller cotyledons and anthocyanin accumulation in the shoot meristem . the primary root length of wild type seedlings is about cm after d of growth while the _PROTEIN_ primary root length is only cm . the root hairs of the _PROTEIN_ mutant initiate normally but are deficient in elongation . lugol staining shows that the _PROTEIN_ mutant has fewer and disorganized columella cells . in addition we found that the overall organization of the _PROTEIN_ root is altered . mutant roots display an irregular cell pattern with a much shorter elongation zone consisting of fewer but larger cells . the wild type roots have meristem cortex cells whereas the _PROTEIN_ mutant has only cells . to further characterize root developmental defects the _PROTEIN_ mutant was crossed with transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ a cell division marker _PROTEIN_ and root development markers _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ mutant displays lower _PROTEIN_ of the cyclin dependent kinase _PROTEIN_ in the root tip compared with the control indicating that fewer cells are actively dividing . also the _PROTEIN_ mutant exhibits reduced _PROTEIN_ of the root stem cell identity markers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ suggesting that root development is abnormal in the mutant . despite the severity of the root defects the _PROTEIN_ mutant does not exhibit strong defects in rosette and inflorescence development . to determine if _PROTEIN_ is required for the activity of the complex the _PROTEIN_ mutant was crossed to the phs _PROTEIN_ gus transgenic line . this line _PROTEIN_ domains i and ii of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ upon heat shock and is used as a reporter for the auxin dependent degradation of the aux/iaa proteins . in the generation homozygous phs _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ plants were identified and gus staining was performed at intervals after a h heat shock treatment . the _PROTEIN_ mutant exhibits less gus staining after the initial heat shock compared with the control . however gus staining is rapidly reduced by iaa treatment in both lines . gus activity was then measured by methylumbelliferyl d _PROTEIN_ assay . we found that loss of gus activity after iaa treatment occurred at a similar rate in the mutant and control lines suggesting that the degradation of the _PROTEIN_ gus protein is not defective in _PROTEIN_ . thus the _PROTEIN_ mutation does not appear to affect the function of in the plant . to determine whether the _PROTEIN_ mutant is deficient in the induction of auxin responsive gene _PROTEIN_ the levels of aux/iaa and transcripts were determined after auxin treatment using real time quantitative pcr . the results show that after treatment with iaa for h the induction of aux/iaa and _PROTEIN_ is similar in the wild type and mutant indicating that the _PROTEIN_ mutation does not directly affect auxin dependent gene _PROTEIN_ . taken together these results suggest that the _PROTEIN_ mutant does not have a defect in dependent auxin signaling . to determine if auxin transport is affected in the _PROTEIN_ mutant we took advantage of the _PROTEIN_ that the synthetic auxins d and napthaleneacetic acid are not substrates for the auxin efflux and influx carriers respectively . five day old _PROTEIN_ seedlings were transferred onto fresh arabidopsis suc _PROTEIN_ plates supplemented with different concentrations of iaa naa or d. after another d of growth the length of newly grown primary root was measured and _PROTEIN_ relative to growth on control plates . the results show that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line exhibits a differential response to iaa and naa compared with d. the mutant has a similar response to the wild type at low concentrations of iaa and naa treatment and is slightly resistant at higher concentrations . however the mutant is strongly resistant to d throughout the concentration range . this suggests that the mutant may be affected in auxin influx . similar results were obtained when we examined _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ after auxin treatment . in the mutant d does not induce activity after overnight treatment . naa treatment results in a slight increase in _METHOD_ signal while iaa clearly enhances _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . however the spatial distribution of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is altered in the mutant with reduced signal in the cell division zone but enhanced _PROTEIN_ in the elongation zone compared with iaa treated wild type roots . moreover the _PROTEIN_ mutant displays a clear resistance to the auxin efflux inhibitor naphthylphthalamic acid with respect to primary root elongation and has a delayed response during root gravitropism . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ auxin transport possibly both auxin efflux and influx components may be defective in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . to further characterize this defect auxin transport was directly measured . the results show that the _PROTEIN_ mutant significantly reduces the transport of applied iaa at the root apex region indicating that the mutant has a defect in _PROTEIN_ auxin transport . to determine whether the defect in auxin transport affects the distribution of auxin in the seedling the level of free iaa was measured in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . compared with the wild type _PROTEIN_ seedlings have a higher level of free iaa in aerial tissues but a reduction of iaa in the root tip region suggesting that auxin synthesized in the shoot is not efficiently transported into the root tip . these results indicate that the _PROTEIN_ mutation interferes with iaa distribution by altering _PROTEIN_ auxin transport . auxin transporters such as _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ play a critical role in _PROTEIN_ auxin transport . because of the auxin transport defect in _PROTEIN_ plants the _PROTEIN_ and distribution of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were determined in the mutant . to visualize _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene was crossed into _PROTEIN_ seedlings . the distribution and level of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were studied by confocal microscopy . the results show that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ level is much lower in the _PROTEIN_ mutant compared with the control line . to examine _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ levels an in situ immunodetection assay was performed using anti _PROTEIN_ and anti _PROTEIN_ antisera . like _PROTEIN_ the levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are dramatically reduced in the mutant . finally we used a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene to show a similar defect in _PROTEIN_ level in the mutant as well . however the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ does not exhibit any obvious difference in the _PROTEIN_ mutant either with or without bfa treatment compared with the control . the results of real time quantitative pcr experiments indicate that the rna levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are similar between the mutant and the wild type suggesting that the reduction of _PROTEIN_ levels in _PROTEIN_ is not related to their transcription . to test whether the _PROTEIN_ mutation affects the stability of the _PROTEIN_ cycloheximide an inhibitor of protein biosynthesis was used to treat seedlings . we also examined the level of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ to determine if _PROTEIN_ has a global effect on the accumulation of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins . after treatment with chx the protein level of _PROTEIN_ was determined through in situ immunodetection assay . the results confirm that _PROTEIN_ levels are reduced in the mutant but that this effect is not due to increased degradation . the levels of pm _PROTEIN_ are similar in the mutant and the wild type indicating that _PROTEIN_ is not universally required for the accumulation of _LOCATION_ proteins . a recent study demonstrated that the shr mutant exhibits a progressive reduction in the levels of the _PROTEIN_ proteins in the root . this _PROTEIN_ raises the possibility that in _PROTEIN_ reduced auxin transport is a consequence of reduced _PROTEIN_ levels . however the root tips of d old _PROTEIN_ seedlings have lower iaa levels than the wild type while shr root tips have higher iaa levels at this age . for this reason we think that the reduction in _PROTEIN_ levels is probably not the primary cause of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels in _PROTEIN_ . nevertheless in the future it will be interesting to explore the potential relations between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ during the development of root tissues . to determine whether the reduction in auxin transporter levels is related to endosome recycling the _PROTEIN_ mutant was crossed to transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ proton _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ homolog _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ markers for trans _LOCATION_ network and prevacuolar compartment localization respectively . the trans _LOCATION_ network and prevacuolar compartment function as early and _PROTEIN_ endosome respectively in plant cells . examination of these lines shows that both markers are _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant indicating that the _PROTEIN_ mutant has fewer early and _PROTEIN_ endosomes . however recycling of these endosomes is still sensitive to bfa similar to the control . to further explore the effects of bfa on _PROTEIN_ accumulation in the mutant we performed a bfa washout experiment . seedlings were treated with bfa for min and then the bfa was washed out for min . the fraction of _PROTEIN_ containing bfa bodies was similar in _PROTEIN_ and wild type roots throughout the experiment indicating that the mutant is not affected in a bfa sensitive aspect of endosome recycling . genetic analyses indicate that the phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutant is induced by a single recessive mutation . to gain insight into the function of _PROTEIN_ the mutation was cloned by a map based strategy . the _PROTEIN_ mutant was crossed to landsberg _LOCATION_ and mutant plants were recovered from the population . after analysis of plants the _PROTEIN_ mutation was mapped to bacterial artificial chromosome on chromosome . based on sequencing data a g to a mutation is located at the end of the second exon of the _GENE_ gene . the mutation causes an rna splicing _LOCATION_ that retains the second intron in the mature mrna . this splice product identified by reverse transcription pcr and sequencing introduces a premature stop codon which may result in a truncated protein . to verify that this mutation is responsible for the phenotype conferred by the _PROTEIN_ mutant a complementation assay was performed . wild type _GENE_ genomic dna including kb of dna sequence upstream of _GENE_ was introduced into the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mutant and homozygous transgenic lines were isolated . these lines display a wild type phenotype both with respect to primary root growth and the _METHOD_ response to d confirming that _GENE_ is _PROTEIN_ . _GENE_ was previously identified as _PROTEIN_ functioning in uv b light response . _PROTEIN_ belongs to the _PROTEIN_ protein family so named for the presence of the _PROTEIN_ domain in the c terminus . in the arabidopsis genome there are six _PROTEIN_ family members . _PROTEIN_ protein has a unique n terminal extension before a gly rich region compared with other _PROTEIN_ proteins . another _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ was identified in the same mutant screen . the _PROTEIN_ mutant displays similar root morphology to the _PROTEIN_ mutant and defects in _PROTEIN_ auxin transport . we also generated the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . these plants exhibit more severe defects in auxin transport and plant developmental growth . this suggests that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have a related and overlapping function in the plant . to analyze the _PROTEIN_ pattern of the _PROTEIN_ gene the _PROTEIN_ gus construct was created and introduced into the _PROTEIN_ mutant . analysis of the transgenic plants reveals that the _PROTEIN_ protein is most abundant in the cotyledons roots and hypocotyls . particularly strong gus staining is observed in the leaf veins root vascular tissues root tip and _PROTEIN_ root primordia . previous work showed that _PROTEIN_ is localized in _LOCATION_ . to investigate the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct was introduced into a transgenic line carrying the _LOCATION_ mcherry based marker pt rb . examination of this line shows that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ colocalizes with pt rb suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is also localized to the _LOCATION_ . since overexpression of _PROTEIN_ by the promoter does not display a strong effect on root development _PROTEIN_ was placed under the control of an estradiol inducible promoter and transformed into wild type plants . without estradiol treatment the root morphology of the transgenic line is similar to the wild type . however after estradiol treatment for d the line displays many more root hairs suggesting that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ can enhance root hair initiation and elongation consistent with a role for _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ auxin transport .
