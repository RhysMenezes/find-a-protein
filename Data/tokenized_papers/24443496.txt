the trans _LOCATION_ network is an important organelle for protein transport at the post _LOCATION_ network which functions as a sorting station that directs cargo proteins to a variety of destinations including post _LOCATION_ compartments and the _LOCATION_ space . however the functions and dynamics of the tgn in plant cells have not been well understood yet . to elucidate the dynamics of the plant tgn we established transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ the ortholog of which is localized to the tgn in yeast and mammalian cells under the control of the native promoter as a tgn marker . observation by confocal laser scanning microscopy and super resolution confocal live imaging microscopy revealed two types of tgn in arabidopsis root the ga tgns _LOCATION_ located on the trans side of the _LOCATION_ apparatus and the _PROTEIN_ tgns _LOCATION_ located away from the _LOCATION_ apparatus and behaving independently . the _PROTEIN_ tgns is derived from a population of ga tgns by segregation although the core of the ga tgn remains even after the generation of the _PROTEIN_ tgn . we further found that the abundance of the _PROTEIN_ tgns differs between observed tissues . our results indicate that the dynamic features of the tgn in plant cells differ from those of animal and yeast cells .
we have already reported that tgns in which _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ resided are clearly separated from but occasionally found very near the _LOCATION_ apparatus when _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is transiently _PROTEIN_ in protoplast cells from arabidopsis cultured cells . this result led us to speculate that the tgn might be defined as a separate compartment distinct from the _LOCATION_ apparatus in arabidopsis cells . to exclude the possibility that overexpression by using the promoter and transient _PROTEIN_ in the protoplast affected the distribution of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ we established transgenic arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and gyp _PROTEIN_ under the control of their own promoters . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have redundant physiological roles and co localize on the tgn . because the _METHOD_ signal of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is most prominent under _PROTEIN_ as compared with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ the transgenic _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was used for further observation to reveal the dynamics of the tgn in arabidopsis . a population of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was observed on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in the division and elongation zone of root tissue . although we can not conclude whether or not this localization is due to overexpression this does not affect observations for the tgn dynamics . first we established transgenic arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ to examine the relationship between the tgn and the _LOCATION_ apparatus in living cells . observation under _PROTEIN_ demonstrated that tgns labeled with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were associated with the trans _LOCATION_ cisternae marked by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in cells of the root division zone . interestingly this result is inconsistent with that obtained from observations based on transient _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts . next we observed the tgn structure of the cells in the root elongation zone . as with the root division zone most of the tgns labeled with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were associated with the trans _LOCATION_ cisternae marked by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . however we also found green _METHOD_ without red _METHOD_ suggesting that some tgns exist independently from the _LOCATION_ apparatus as in the case of protoplast cells . further observation in the root differential zone revealed that tgns independent from the _LOCATION_ apparatus were easily observable . here we designate the tgn associated with the _LOCATION_ apparatus and the tgn independent from the _LOCATION_ apparatus as the _LOCATION_ associated tgn and the _LOCATION_ released independent tgn _PROTEIN_ respectively . to characterize the _PROTEIN_ tgns the number of _PROTEIN_ tgns in cells of each division elongation and differentiation zone was counted for quantitative analysis . as shown in fig . the number of _PROTEIN_ tgns in the differentiation zone was clearly larger than in the division and elongation zones . _PROTEIN_ tgns were rarely observed in the division zone . the ratio of _PROTEIN_ tgns in the differentiation zone was over three times higher than that of the division zone . next to investigate the possibility that a trans _LOCATION_ cisterna labeled by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ might behave independently from a cis _LOCATION_ cisterna and that the _PROTEIN_ tgns were observed as the result of dynamic behavior of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labeled tgn in elongation and differentiation zones we generated transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ and those _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ observation of the transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed that the _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ was almost completely co localized in the division elongation and differentiation zones of root . punctate structures with partial overlapping of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were often seen however non overlapping _METHOD_ patterns were not observed in any types of cells . these results indicate that the _PROTEIN_ tgn actually exists separated from the _LOCATION_ apparatus while the cis and trans cisternae of the _LOCATION_ apparatus behave together at all times . then we examined the transgenic line _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ were almost completely co localized in the division elongation and differentiation zones of root and no _METHOD_ signal from _METHOD_ alone or _METHOD_ alone was observed . these results suggest that the feature of _PROTEIN_ tgns described in fig . is not specific to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ but represents the nature of the tgn itself in the root cells . taken together we conclude that arabidopsis root contains two types of tgn the ga tgn located on the trans side of the _LOCATION_ apparatus and the _PROTEIN_ tgn which does not lie adjacent to the _LOCATION_ apparatus and behaves independently . _PROTEIN_ tgn was detected more frequently in the differentiation zone of root . to characterize the ga tgn and _PROTEIN_ tgn we investigated the response to brefeldin a of the ga tgn and _PROTEIN_ tgn in the division elongation and differentiation zones of the root . bfa an antibiotic compound produced by fungi is known as a potent inhibitor of guanine nucleotide exchange _PROTEIN_ for arf _PROTEIN_ . bfa treatment leads to tgn and endosome aggregation in arabidopsis root and cotyledon cells . when arabidopsis root _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was treated with bfa for h cells in the division zone showed tgns labeled with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ aggregating at the center of the bfa body . in the same cells _LOCATION_ apparatus labeled with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulated at the periphery of the tgn accumulation . quantitative analysis of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ clearly demonstrated that the tgn was centrally located in the bfa body . similar results were obtained from observations in the elongation and differentiation zones of root . because the _PROTEIN_ tgn which is marked by an independent _METHOD_ signal and not associated with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was not observed upon bfa treatment even in the differentiation zone we inferred that the _PROTEIN_ tgn was also contained in the bfa body . these results suggest that the response of the _PROTEIN_ tgn to bfa was similar to that of the ga tgn in arabidopsis root at least under the experimental conditions we employed in this study . next to characterize the difference between the ga tgn and _PROTEIN_ tgn in more detail the relationships between the _LOCATION_ apparatus and the ga and _PROTEIN_ tgn were investigated using sclim which enables two color observation with extremely high speed and sensitivity . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plant was observed by sclim with optical slices apart in the z axis and images were reconstructed into with deconvolution to achieve high spatial resolution . in the division zone the _LOCATION_ apparatus labeled by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was observed as a flat donut like structure and the ga tgn labeled by _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was clearly associated with and located at the trans side end of the _LOCATION_ apparatus . the surface of the tgn on the opposite side of the _LOCATION_ apparatus seemed to be an irregular structure . in the differentiation zone _PROTEIN_ tgns were easily observed . unlike the ga tgn structure _PROTEIN_ tgns which were obviously not associated with the _LOCATION_ apparatus had a smooth and round shape . in addition we observed occasional association of _PROTEIN_ tgns and ga tgns . these results imply that _PROTEIN_ tgns exchange materials with ga tgns or _PROTEIN_ tgns could be generated by maturation from the ga tgns . some small puncta showed only _METHOD_ _METHOD_ without _METHOD_ but these might be due to background noises . here we address the question of whether _PROTEIN_ tgns were derived from ga tgns or generated de novo . to answer this question a transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was observed by time lapse imaging of sclim . from a ga tgn whose action was linked to that of the _LOCATION_ apparatus a new _PROTEIN_ tgn was generated . interestingly a portion of the ga tgn remained beside the _LOCATION_ apparatus . after that the remaining ga tgns and the _LOCATION_ apparatus moved together . fig . show enlarged images of the same event indicating that a _PROTEIN_ tgn _METHOD_ by budding from a pre existing ga tgn . once the _PROTEIN_ tgn was generated it moved around freely independently from the _LOCATION_ apparatus . we also observed that two _PROTEIN_ tgns interacted with each other moved together and eventually separated again . another observation of the generation of _PROTEIN_ tgns was demonstrated in fig . and d. these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ tgns are derived from a population of ga tgns by segregation and that they can communicate with each other . next the behavior of a ga tgn after giving rise to a _PROTEIN_ tgn was examined in detail by imaging . as shown in fig . we identified the moment when a _PROTEIN_ tgn was generated from a ga tgn . a homotypic interaction of two ga tgns was observed earlier . then the dynamics of ga tgns after segregation was continuously observed . time lapse images indicated that the intensity of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ gradually increased whereas that of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . for quantitative analysis we compared the total _METHOD_ intensity of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ in the images shown in fig . and found that the intensity of the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ from ga tgn after s of segregation was almost times higher than that of the ga tgn soon after the _PROTEIN_ tgn was generated . the _PROTEIN_ intensity of _METHOD_ from the _LOCATION_ apparatus could have resulted from photobleaching . these results imply that the core of the ga tgn remains even after the generation of the _PROTEIN_ tgn and that the ga tgn is re organized by recapturing tgn proteins .
plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ have already been reported and plants that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were gifts from karin schumacher . the plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were generated by crossing . seeds were sterilized in sodium hypochlorite and tween rinsed with sterile distilled water three times and sown on murashige and skoog _METHOD_ medium supplemented with sucrose phytagel and gamborg s vitamins . the plants were incubated for d at in the dark and cultivated at under continuous light . we observed cortex cells in the division and elongation zone and epidermal cells in the differentiation zone of transgenic plants . for observation a confocal laser scanning microscope _PROTEIN_ was used . for high resolution or imaging sclim was employed . in the sclim system that we developed an olympus ix microscope was equipped with an olympus oil immersion lens uplansapo a custom made super low noise and high speed confocal scanner a custom made spectroscopic filter system custom made cooled image intensifiers and high speed and high sensitivity em ccd cameras . data were oversampled and subjected to a deconvolution analysis with volocity by using the point spread function optimized for the yokogawa spinning disk confocal system . five to seven day old seedlings were incubated in ml of _METHOD_ medium with bfa for h. after treatment the _METHOD_ was observed with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as described above .
