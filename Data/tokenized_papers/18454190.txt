molybdenum is an essential micronutrient for plants serving as a cofactor for enzymes involved in nitrate assimilation sulfite detoxification abscisic acid biosynthesis and purine degradation . here we show that natural variation in shoot mo content across arabidopsis thaliana accessions is controlled by variation in a mitochondrially localized transporter _PROTEIN_ that belongs to the sulfate transporter superfamily . a deletion in the _PROTEIN_ promoter is strongly associated with low shoot mo occurring in seven of the accessions with the lowest shoot content of mo . consistent with the low mo phenotype _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in low mo accessions is reduced . reciprocal grafting experiments demonstrate that the roots of ler are responsible for the low mo accumulation in shoot and gus localization demonstrates that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ strongly in the roots . _PROTEIN_ contains an n terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence and _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ tagged with _METHOD_ in protoplasts and transgenic plants establishing the mitochondrial localization of this protein . furthermore _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ specifically enhances mo accumulation in yeast by fold consistent with _PROTEIN_ functioning as a molybdate transporter . this work provides the first molecular insight into the processes that regulate mo accumulation in plants and shows that novel loci can be detected by association mapping .
shoot tissue from a geographically diverse panel of arabidopsis accessions was screened in an effort to identify accessions which have altered mo content in shoot tissue . based on this survey it was determined that the shoot content of mo in arabidopsis is under genetic control with an approximately fold difference between the highest and lowest mo levels observed across the diverse set of arabidopsis accession tested . shoot mo content was found to be not normally distributed around the population mean with accessions accumulating less than mo and accessions _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ accumulating more than mo . we had previously identified ler as a low mo accumulating accession of arabidopsis and all ler lines tested were low in mo . shoot tissue of ler contains less mo compared to col and this difference from col is observed for ler when plants were grown with a broad range of mo concentrations in the nutrient solution . we selected this accession for further study due to the extensive genetic resources available for this accession including the availability of genome sequence data and recombinant inbred lines along with high density genotype data . a shoot mo content

lines denote the low and high accessions as detailed in the text . the black arrow denotes col mo content . shoot mo concentrations are normalized so that the average of the col and cvi means included in each growth tray are equivalent across all trays . plants were grown in soil for weeks . data represents median values for each accession . b mo accumulation of col ler van _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ double mutant . data is shown as a five number summary for each line and is summarized from an average of replicate plants for each line . lower case letters denote groups that are not significantly different from each other at p < with the holm correction . plants were grown in soil for weeks . c shoot mo accumulation in arabidopsis in response to increasing levels of mo in the nutrient solution . mo accumulation in col and ler after weeks of growth in soil at varying concentrations of mo in the watering solution . data is shown as a five number summary for each line and is summarized from replicate plants for each treatment . the analysis of mo in shoot and root tissue of hydroponically grown ler and col plants confirmed the low shoot mo content of ler . furthermore ler also has a reduced mo content in roots when compared to col suggesting that the low shoot mo content is not due to enhanced accumulation of mo in the roots but rather to reduced mo uptake by the roots . grafting experiments were performed to determine if low shoot mo in ler is determined by the root or shoot . shoots and roots from day old seedlings of ler and col were reciprocally grafted and grafted plants grown for weeks in soil with short days . plants with ler roots had significantly lower shoot mo contents than plants with col roots whether the shoots were ler or col . the genotype of the shoot stock had no significant effect on mo content of the shoot . from this it was concluded that the low shoot mo content of ler is driven solely by the roots . mo content in col and ler after weeks growth and col _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ double mutant after weeks growth . presented data are the means of at least three biological replicates and _LOCATION_ bars . mo contents in arabidopsis plants grafted at days after germination and transferred to soil for growth were determined in self grafted plants of col and ler col shoot grafted onto ler root and ler shoot grafted onto col root . data is shown as a five number summary for each line with outliers denoted by small circles . in a ler cross of the progeny analyzed were found to have low shoot mo contents similar to the ler parent . this ratio is consistent with the hypothesis that the low mo phenotype in ler is controlled by a single locus or several closely linked loci . similar segregation patterns were observed in an population derived from a ler cross to an ionomics mutant in the col background . to obtain a rough map position a bulk segregant analysis experiment was performed with microarray detection of genetic markers _PROTEIN_ using plants . plants with the lowest shoot mo contents and plants with mo shoot contents similar to col were pooled separately and genomic dna from each pool hybridized to the affymetrix arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ dna microarray . using the oligonucleotide probes on the dna microarray which show differential hybridization between ler and col as genetic markers _METHOD_ _METHOD_ the locus responsible for the low shoot mo content in ler was mapped to an area centered at mb on chromosome . a bulk segregant analysis of the low shoot mo content in an population from a col cross.data are presented as a scaled pool hybridization difference representing the difference between the hybridization of the two pools at the _METHOD_ scaled so that a pure col pool would be at and a pure ler pool would be at . the pools were prepared from plants with a low mo content and plants with a high mo content . _METHOD_ were scored after hybridization of genomic dna prepared from these pools to affymetrix _PROTEIN_ dna microarrays . dotted lines denote likely location of the causal loci . b shoot mo content and genotype on chromosome ii of selected col rils . the genotype of each of the markers determined by singer et al . for chromosome ii are shown col alleles are denoted in black ler in white . the average shoot mo content for each line is shown and those with col shoot levels of mo are underlined . blue lines indicate the narrowed mapping interval on chromosome ii . c structure of the _PROTEIN_ gene . the dna sequence of _PROTEIN_ showing location of the t dna insert in _PROTEIN_ and the base pair deletion in the utr in the seven accessions with low shoot mo content aligned with the col dna sequence with the _PROTEIN_ box underlined . to further narrow down the map position of the locus controlling low shoot mo content in ler the col ril population was used to identify seven recombinants in the mapping region we had previously determined from the bsa . dna microarray based genotyping of this col ril set was used to further refine the break points between col and ler genotypes . the shoot mo contents of these seven rils showed a clear segregation with the genetic markers for col and ler within our mapping region allowing us to classify these lines as having either the col or the ler allele for the low mo locus . the precise breakpoints identified by singer et al . allowed the mapping interval to be narrowed to kb on chromosome an interval containing genes . candidate genes from this interval were selected based on annotation and _PROTEIN_ differences between col and ler . t dna insertional alleles for these candidate genes were obtained and the plants scored for low shoot mo content compared to wild type col . a null mutant _PROTEIN_ with an insertion disrupting the coding region of the gene was observed to phenocopy the ler low shoot mo content when grown in either soil or shoots and roots when grown hydroponically . differences in the absolute concentrations of mo between col in are related to differences in growth conditions between these two experiments . the gene was originally predicted to be a putative sulfate transporter and named . we have renamed this gene _PROTEIN_ based on its phenotype of low shoot mo content . furthermore we detected no change in the shoot content of s in _PROTEIN_ or in the content of li b na mg p k ca mn fe co ni cu zn as se and cd providing additional support for the reannotation of as _PROTEIN_ . quantitative real time rt pcr of the _PROTEIN_ transcript in _PROTEIN_ and ler revealed that both these low shoot mo lines had significantly reduced _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ in both root and shoot tissue compared to col . van a second low shoot mo accession was also confirmed by qrt pcr to have low _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . significantly we observed no differences in shoot s content between col and either ler or van . data is shown as a five number summary for each line and is summarized from an average of replicate plants for each line . no significant differences were observed . plants were grown in soil for weeks . the data is from the same plants as in . steady state _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ level was compared in shoots and roots of col ler van and _PROTEIN_ using quantitative real time pcr . rna was isolated from shoot and root of plants grown in soil for weeks under short day conditions for normalization across samples _PROTEIN_ of the actin gene was used and the relative _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ calculated using the method . presented data are the means of at least three biological replicates each analyzed times by qrt pcr . _LOCATION_ bars . to establish if _PROTEIN_ is the locus responsible for the low shoot mo content of ler and van we crossed _PROTEIN_ and col to both ler and van to test for complementation . plants from the ler and van crosses contained significantly different levels of shoot mo from either parent suggesting that the col allele of the low mo locus could only partially complement the ler allele . plants from the ler and van crosses were found to have significantly lower shoot mo contents than similar plants from the ler and van crosses . such data establishes that _PROTEIN_ is deficient in complementing the low shoot mo content of both ler and van . this is strong evidence confirming that the ler and van alleles are allelic with the recessive loss of function allele of _PROTEIN_ . shoot mo content of col ler van _PROTEIN_ and plants from crosses between col col ler van col in week old soil grown plants are shown . data is represented as a five number summary for each line and is summarized from an average of replicate plants for each line . lower case letters denote groups that are not significantly different from each other at p < with the holm correction . to determine the polymorphism in the _PROTEIN_ ler allele causal for low shoot mo content we sequenced _PROTEIN_ including kb upstream and bp downstream of the coding sequence in both ler and van . we observed _METHOD_ in common between ler and van as well as several _METHOD_ unique to each accession when compared to the col reference sequence . these include single nucleotide _METHOD_ in the kb upstream region two snps that change two amino acids in the coding region and a base pair deletion nucleotides upstream from the translation start site . the deletion includes the _PROTEIN_ box . the altered _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in both of the low shoot mo accessions ler and van suggested that this deletion may be the causal polymorphism driving low shoot mo content in these accessions . to obtain further evidence that this deletion is the casual polymorphism driving low shoot mo content we performed an association analysis by sequencing the _PROTEIN_ promoter region containing the bp deletion in ler and van across of the accessions originally screened for shoot mo content . combining this information with the nordborg genotypes we were able to scan for significant genetic associations with low shoot mo content . the bp deletion identified in ler and van was found in seven of the accessions tested and all accessions with the deletion had low shoot mo content compared to the overall distribution of shoot mo contents . the distribution of p values for genome wide associations with shoot mo contents were skewed towards significance suggesting a relationship between mo content and the underlying population structure making the evaluation of individual loci difficult . however when kinship and population structure were taken into account the presence of the bp deletion was found to be highly significantly associated with low shoot mo content and accounted for of the total variation in mo accumulation . once the _PROTEIN_ ler loci is accounted for there were several other markers which showed significant associations with mo accumulation and these may represent additional loci of interest . to establish that _PROTEIN_ has the capacity to transport mo the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ cdna was _PROTEIN_ in yeast . yeast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were observed to specifically accumulate five time more mo than vector only controls . furthermore the accumulation of no other element including na mg p s k ca mn fe co ni cu zn and cd was observed to be altered more than in two independent experiments . this evidence is consistent with _PROTEIN_ being a specific molybdate transporter . cell associated mo in yeast transformed with either vector only or vector containing cdnas encoding _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ after growth for hours . data is represented as a five number summary for each line and is summarized from n replicate yeast cultures for each genotype . to determine the tissue localization of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ col was transformed with a kb _PROTEIN_ promoter gus construct . in all of the promoter gus lines examined gus staining was observed in the roots hypocotyls and leaves . in roots gus staining was most pronounced just behind the growing root tip in the primary root and the _PROTEIN_ roots . cross sections show that the strong gus staining behind the root tip was restricted _PROTEIN_ to the protodermal cells . at the beginning of the elongation zone gus staining was _PROTEIN_ restricted to the epidermis and cortex . thereafter gus staining in the root also occurred in the vascular tissue . in the hypocotyls the gus staining was also _PROTEIN_ restricted to the vascular tissue . in fully expanded leaves gus staining was found in the vascular tissue . however the _PROTEIN_ vein was less intensely stained than the _PROTEIN_ veins . during flowering gus activity was also visible in the vasculature of the stem leaves but not in the vasculature of the stem flowers or developing siliques including seeds . pictures represent histochemical analysis of gus activity in arabidopsis plants stably transformed with a _PROTEIN_ promoter gus construct . a primary root shown from root tip to the beginning of the _PROTEIN_ root development . boxes denote close ups shown in b c and d b root tip and cross section shown in insert panel _PROTEIN_ . c root elongation zone with a cross section shown in insert panel _PROTEIN_ d root shown from between the elongation zone and the start of the _PROTEIN_ root production zone e hypocotyl f fully expanded leaves . pd protoderm co cortex vb vascular bundle ep epidermis . the sub cellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein was determined by transiently _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ c terminal _METHOD_ translational fusion construct in shoot derived col protoplasts and by stable ectopic _PROTEIN_ of a similar construct in col . the _METHOD_ signal was observed to co localize with the mitochondrial marker f _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in shoot derived protoplasts transiently _PROTEIN_ the construct and with the mitotracker red dye in roots of the stably transformed lines . the experimentally determined mitochondrial localization for _PROTEIN_ is in good agreement with several sub cellular prediction _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ which predict a mitochondrial targeting sequence at the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was transiently _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis leaf protoplasts co transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dic _METHOD_ filter _METHOD_ filter and merged image . roots of arabidopsis stably transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and stained with mitotracker red red filter _METHOD_ filter merged . phylogenetic analysis of the sulfate transporter family in arabidopsis and rice reveal two arabidopsis genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to have diverged significantly from the other sulfate transporter family members and each arabidopsis gene has a rice ortholog . given the sequence similarity between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the shoot mo content of a t dna insertion line was analyzed to determine if it also shows the low mo phenotype observed in _PROTEIN_ . we were unable to detect any significant changes in the mo content of shoot of when grown in soil and the roots and shoot mo accumulation of a _PROTEIN_ double mutant was not significantly different from the _PROTEIN_ mutant alone . . the mo content of yeast heterologously _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ cdna was found not to be reproducibly significantly different from vector only controls in two independent experiments . thus we can find no evidence that _PROTEIN_ is also a mo transporter . a search of the _METHOD_ database www.purdue.edu/ionomics found four t dna lines with insertions in sulfate transporters representing the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ subfamilies none of which accumulated significantly different levels of mo than col .
all accessions were obtained from the _PROTEIN_ or lehle seeds . the insertion of the t dna into the _PROTEIN_ coding region in _PROTEIN_ and into the _PROTEIN_ coding region in were verified by sequencing and the mutant was confirmed to be null for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by rt pcr . all t dna lines analyzed were homozygous for the t dna insertion . plants used for elemental profiling by icp _METHOD_ analysis were grown in a controlled environment h light h dark and to . briefly seeds were sown onto moist soil with various elements added at subtoxic concentrations and stratified at for d. plants were bottom watered twice per week with hoagland solution in which iron was replaced with fe hbed _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . alternatively for the data shown in samples were analyzed at _METHOD_ . frozen plant material was homogenized with a mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen . after transfer into ml tubes the plant material was freeze dried . samples were acid digested and analyzed by icp _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . broad sense heritability was calculated using a general _PROTEIN_ to account for line and growth tray variation . a linear mixed model adjusting population structure confounding effects as in was used to test the marker trait associations . a brief summary of the model is given below where y is the vector of phenotype is the vector of fixed allele effects is the vector of subpopulation effects u is the vector of random effects reflecting the genome wide relatedness and x q z are known incidence _PROTEIN_ relating the observations to fixed and random effects respectively . the variance of phenotype was modeled asthus the phenotypic variance can be partitioned into two parts g the genetic variance attributable to genome wide effects and e the residual variance . the q and k _PROTEIN_ was the same as in with q being the population assignments by structure and k being the kinship coefficient _PROTEIN_ estimated as the proportion of shared haplotypes between individual pairs . dna microarray based bsa was realized as previously described . briefly _METHOD_ were identified between col and ler by hybridizing labeled genomics dna from each one of the accessions to affymetrix _PROTEIN_ microarrays and comparing them to col hybridizations downloaded from http //www.naturalvariation.org/xam . two genomic dna pools from an population of a cross between ler and the mutant in the col background were created and hybridized to separate dna microarrays . each one of the pools contained plants with either shoot mo contents similar to col or low shoot mo contents similar to ler . at loci unlinked to the low mo phenotype the pools should have equivalent amounts of each genotype and the hybridization signal at each _METHOD_ should be intermediate between the two parent accessions for an average difference between the two dna microarrays of zero . at linked loci the difference between the two dna pools should be approximately two thirds the difference between the parent accessions . by smoothing the signal across multiple _METHOD_ noise is reduced and the peak of the differences in hybridization signal will correspond to the chromosomal region of the loci controlling the low mo trait . raw hybridization data for each probe on the _PROTEIN_ dna microarrays used in these experiments have been submitted to the gene _PROTEIN_ omnibus for public distribution . seedlings to be grafted as previously described by _PROTEIN_ . plants were harvested for analysis of shoot mo content weeks after transfer to soil . postharvest analysis of graft unions was performed under the stereoscope to identify any adventitious root formation from grafted individuals . individuals with adventitious roots

into gpd _PROTEIN_ . two separate _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein constructs were cloned one at purdue and one at _METHOD_ . to construct the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein _PROTEIN_ was amplified from cdna using pcr with tgc tct _PROTEIN_ gca tgg _PROTEIN_ ctc _PROTEIN_ ctc _PROTEIN_ gag _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and tcc gga tcc ttc ctc ctc cag cat _PROTEIN_ cac cgg _PROTEIN_ gcg ggg g _PROTEIN_ primers . the pcr product was confirmed by sequencing and cloned into the xbai and bamhi sites of the _METHOD_ plasmid to created chimeric _METHOD_ fusion constructs under the control of the promoter . the use of the two specific oligonucleotide primers gga tcc gca _PROTEIN_ gag ctt acc _PROTEIN_ tct c and gga tcc gaa aca gag caa taa gcg _PROTEIN_ ctc allowed isolation of a bp _PROTEIN_ promoter dna fragment from arabidopsis col genomic dna by pcr . after subcloning in pgem teasy and sequencing the bamhi restriction sites in the primer sequences were used for further cloning of the promoter dna fragment into the bamhi site of the vector harboring the promoterless _PROTEIN_ gene . for preparation of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct the full orf without the stop codon was amplified from total cdna by using the two specific oligonucleotide primers gga tcc _PROTEIN_ gga _PROTEIN_ tca _PROTEIN_ tca gag _PROTEIN_ and gga tcc _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ttc acc gga _PROTEIN_ cgg gg . the bam hi restriction site replacing the stop codon allowed the cloning of the coding dna in frame to the _METHOD_ gene in the binary vector which contained the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter mcs _METHOD_ cassette . the binary plasmids were transformed into agrobacterium tumefaciens by the freeze/thaw method . arabidopsis col plants were transformed using the floral dip method . transgenic
