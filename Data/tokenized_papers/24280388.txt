plant cells face unique _PROTEIN_ to efficiently export cargo from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to mobile _LOCATION_ stacks . coat protein complex ii _PROTEIN_ components which include two heterodimers of and facilitate selective cargo export from the _LOCATION_ however little is known about the _METHOD_ that regulate their recruitment to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ especially in plants . here we report a protein transport mutant of arabidopsis thaliana named which abnormally accumulates precursor _METHOD_ of storage proteins in seeds . has a deletion in the putative ortholog of the saccharomyces cerevisiae and homo sapiens which encodes a critical component of _LOCATION_ exit sites _LOCATION_ . mag mutants developed abnormal structures within the _LOCATION_ and exhibited compromised _LOCATION_ export . a functional green _METHOD_ protein fusion localized at _LOCATION_ associated cup shaped _LOCATION_ and cycled on and off these sites at a slower rate than the _PROTEIN_ coat . interacted with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ however in the absence of recruitment of the _PROTEIN_ coat to _LOCATION_ was accelerated . our results identify a key component of _LOCATION_ export in plants by demonstrating that is required for protein export at _LOCATION_ that are associated with mobile _LOCATION_ stacks where it regulates _PROTEIN_ coat turnover .
seeds of wild type arabidopsis contain two major storage proteins globulin and albumin but no precursors of these proteins . immunoblotting with a specific antibody against each of these storage proteins showed that in seeds of the mutant precursor _METHOD_ of both storage proteins were abnormally accumulated . this suggested that has a defect either in the transport pathway from the _LOCATION_ to psvs or in the conversion of precursors to mature _METHOD_ . the former defect generates a kd precursor of albumin whereas the latter defect generates and kd precursors of albumin . as accumulated a kd precursor of albumin is it likely to have defective transport machinery . similar results were obtained with the other known mag mutants _PROTEIN_ has a defect in a homolog of rint on the _LOCATION_ whereas _PROTEIN_ has a defect in a homolog of the _LOCATION_ tethering _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ both contained the kd precursor of albumin . therefore the mag screen successfully identified _PROTEIN_ responsible for protein transport from the _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ . map based cloning and dna sequencing revealed that has a bp deletion in the first exon of _GENE_ . consistent with this the rt pcr product of generated using primers that flanked the deletion _PROTEIN_ was shorter than that of the wild type . sequencing analysis of cdna in revealed that the deletion caused a frameshift and a stop codon . therefore although produces a transcript the mutant is likely null . to further link the phenotype to disruption of the _GENE_ gene we isolated two allelic mutants with a t dna insertion in the ninth or first exon of _GENE_ that we named and respectively . based on a lack of detectable _GENE_ transcripts both and were rna null mutants . consistent with this immunoblots clearly showed that and both accumulated abnormal levels of the precursors of storage proteins similar to . these results together with the complementation test results indicate that mutation of _GENE_ is responsible for the phenotype . the _GENE_ protein has low sequence similarity to human and yeast . the central region of _GENE_ containing amino acids has identity to the corresponding region of human whereas the c terminal region of _GENE_ containing amino acids has identity to the corresponding region of human . the c terminal region of _GENE_ containing amino acids has identity to the corresponding region of yeast . these c terminal and central regions are conserved domains among proteins and are proposed to mediate the interactions of proteins with other _PROTEIN_ components . thus it _METHOD_ possible that the _GENE_ protein is a homolog of . here we designate the _GENE_ gene as . the arabidopsis genome has another gene that is similar to and is situated next to in the genome . the protein shares identity and similarity with and is hereafter designated as _PROTEIN_ . we established three mutants of _PROTEIN_ all of which were rna null mutants . none of the mutants exhibited abnormal accumulation of storage protein precursors in seeds . this is consistent with the _PROTEIN_ that _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is lower than that of in maturing seeds _PROTEIN_ . we examined whether the lack of induces defects at the subcellular level . live cell imaging is not feasible in seeds therefore we compared the seed cells of the three mutants with those of the wild type plants using immunoelectron microscopy . in wild type seed cells the storage proteins globulin and albumin were localized in electron dense psvs . by contrast all mutants developed abnormal structures that contained electron dense cores in diameter . immunoelectron analyses of the mutants revealed that albumin was present in the cores of these structures whereas globulin was detected in the _PROTEIN_ region . these features resemble those of mag bodies observed in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants which are defective in trafficking between the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ . a defect in transport at the _LOCATION_ interface of the mutants may lead to the generation of mag bodies in seed cells in the mutants . to test whether loss of also caused defects in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ traffic in other tissues the knockout line was stably transformed with the _LOCATION_ marker sialyl transferase _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . in epidermal cells of wild type plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ clearly localized in the _LOCATION_ . however in the background _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was partially distributed in the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . to establish whether this abnormal distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was linked to defects in _LOCATION_ export we performed _METHOD_ recovery after photobleaching analyses of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ .the _METHOD_ recovery rate of the marker was compared between the mutant and wild type plants . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ cycled in and out of the _LOCATION_ significantly more slowly in the mutant than in the wild type although the mobile fraction of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was similar in the two backgrounds . consistent with these results when _LOCATION_ export was indirectly inhibited using brefeldin a which disrupts _PROTEIN_ assembly at the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ redistributed to the _LOCATION_ to a greater extent in the mutant compared with the wild type . taken together these data demonstrate that protein export from the _LOCATION_ is affected by the lack of functional . to determine the subcellular distribution of we introduced genomic _METHOD_ whose _PROTEIN_ was driven by the native promoter _METHOD_ into the mutant and obtained seven independent lines . storage protein precursors did not accumulate in seeds from any of these lines indicating that the _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ under the control of the native promoter rescued the phenotype . hence _METHOD_ is functional in vivo . the transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the native promoter exhibited flluorescent punctate structures in epidermal cells of cotyledons . similarly transgenic plants that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the control of the promoter displayed punctate _METHOD_ structures . the transgenic plants had a healthy phenotype and a normal morphology indicating that overexpression of _METHOD_ does not significantly disrupt plant growth . to determine the distribution of with respect to secretory organelles _METHOD_ was coexpressed with several specific markers an inert luminal marker of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ yk a marker of the most cis _LOCATION_ cisternae _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ a marker of trans _LOCATION_ cisternae _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and trans _LOCATION_ network marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . confocal microscopy analyses showed that _METHOD_ overlapped with _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ was present in cup like punctate structures within the _LOCATION_ yk labeled _LOCATION_ network . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was not uniform in these structures and was more intense in some regions . nonetheless the punctate appearance of _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ in cells irrespective of the abundance of the marker _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we also found that _METHOD_ partially overlapped with the _LOCATION_ yk signal and to a lesser extent with _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . did not overlap with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the differences in distribution of and the _LOCATION_ marker with respect to a single focal imaging plane could account for an apparent lack of codistribution . to examine this we performed time lapse microscopy in cells coexpressing _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and ensured coincident distribution of the structures labeled by and the _LOCATION_ markers over time . to explore the distribution of _METHOD_ with respect to the _LOCATION_ we acquired consecutive optical slices of cells coexpressing _METHOD_ and _LOCATION_ yk for three dimensional reconstruction and rendering . _METHOD_ was surrounded by a cup shaped subdomain of the _LOCATION_ . these data indicate that is localized in structures that are associated with mobile _LOCATION_ stacks . to identify interacting proteins extracts from whole seedlings of transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the control of the promoter were immunoprecipitated using an anti _METHOD_ antibody . the immunoprecipitates were subjected to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ followed by immunoblotting with an anti _METHOD_ antibody or silver staining . full length _METHOD_ and degradation products were concentrated in the precipitates along with other proteins . linear trap quadrupole orbitrap _METHOD_ _METHOD_ identified with the highest score . _PROTEIN_ was also listed by the software although we could not distinguish any unique peptides of _PROTEIN_ . the arabidopsis genome has two closely related _PROTEIN_ genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . interestingly these _PROTEIN_ proteins were detected with the second and third highest scores with high amino acid coverage and unique peptides were identified for both . the interaction of with _PROTEIN_ proteins was also examined using a yeast two hybrid assay . in agreement with the immunoprecipitation analysis interacted with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in yeast _METHOD_ a heterodimer with as part of the _PROTEIN_ coat . the arabidopsis genome encodes two putative _PROTEIN_ orthologs . we detected an interaction between and _PROTEIN_ and of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . these results suggest that functions in concert with _PROTEIN_ components . the dynamic relationship between and _PROTEIN_ components was analyzed . plant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have all been used as _PROTEIN_ coat markers . coexpression analyses showed that fusion proteins had a largely overlapping distribution with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ indicating that the distribution of within the cell coincides with that of _PROTEIN_ markers . this result taken together with the association of with cup shaped _LOCATION_ suggests that could be an ideal marker of the plant _LOCATION_ . next we compared the dynamics of and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ coat proteins are rapidly turned over at _LOCATION_ . in mammalian cells cycles on and off the _LOCATION_ at a slower rate than other _PROTEIN_ components . to compare the dynamics of with those of _PROTEIN_ coat proteins at plant _LOCATION_ frap experiments were conducted in leaf epidermal cells of either the mutant rescued with pro _METHOD_ or the transgenic line _PROTEIN_ a functional fusion protein of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ using latrunculin b to depolymerize actin and inhibit _LOCATION_ movement . spot bleach frap was conducted as described previously and the data were fitted to a single exponential . _METHOD_ cycled on and off _LOCATION_ with an average half time of recovery of s _LOCATION_ . this turnover was significantly slower than that of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ which had an average half time of recovery of s _LOCATION_ . to compare the availabilities of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ for cycling on and off _LOCATION_ the mobile fractions of the two fusion proteins were measured . a significantly smaller proportion of _METHOD_ was mobile compared with that of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ . similar results were obtained from experiments using leaf epidermal cells of tobacco plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and from experiments using stable arabidopsis transformants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ had an average half time of recovery of s which was much slower than that of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the mobile fraction of _METHOD_ was lower than that of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . these data indicate that _LOCATION_ protein kinetics is conserved among species _PROTEIN_ . to test whether deficiency of affects the _LOCATION_ associations of _PROTEIN_ components we prepared microsomal and soluble fractions from wild type and seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and then subjected these fractions to immunoblot analyses . the fraction of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ that associated with _LOCATION_ did not significantly differ between wild type and seedlings . similarly the fraction of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ that associated with _LOCATION_ did not significantly differ between wild type and seedlings . furthermore the fraction of endogenous _PROTEIN_ protein that associated with _LOCATION_ did not significantly differ between wild type and seedlings . overall these data suggest that loss of does not quantitatively affect the _LOCATION_ association of the _PROTEIN_ coat components to _LOCATION_ . next we aimed to establish the effects of loss of functional on the dynamic assembly of _PROTEIN_ coat at _LOCATION_ . therefore we analyzed the dynamic cycling of inner and outer _PROTEIN_ coat components on and off _LOCATION_ in the background by stably _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . frap analyses showed that cycling of these two _PROTEIN_ coat components on and off _LOCATION_ was significantly faster in the mutant than in wild type plants . these data indicate that the cycling of _PROTEIN_ components on and off _LOCATION_ is higher in the absence of than in the presence of which supports a regulatory role of in _PROTEIN_ coat assembly at _LOCATION_ in plants .
