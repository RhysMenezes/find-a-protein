zinc ions are required to _PROTEIN_ the biological activity of numerous proteins . however when mislocalized or accumulated in excess ions are toxic because of adventitious binding to proteins and displacement of other metal ions among them from their binding sites . heterologous _PROTEIN_ of a previously uncharacterized arabidopsis thaliana metal tolerance protein _PROTEIN_ in the mutant of budding yeast restores tolerance to and cellular accumulation of zinc and cobalt . an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein localizes to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ when _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . ectopic over _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ increases zn accumulation in both roots and rosette leaves of a. thaliana and enhances zn tolerance . exposure of wild type plants to high but non toxic concentrations of zn or co or fe deficiency strongly induce _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ specifically in epidermal and cortex cells of the root hair zone . silencing of _PROTEIN_ by rna interference causes zn hypersensitivity and enhances zn accumulation in above ground organs of soil grown plants and of seedlings exposed to excess zn or to fe deficiency . our data indicate that in wild type a. thaliana the _PROTEIN_ protein contributes to basic cellular zn tolerance and controls zn partitioning particularly under conditions of high rates of zn influx into the root symplasm .
the a. thaliana genome encodes a predicted protein _PROTEIN_ which shares sequence identity with the previously characterized zn transport protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . verification of the _PROTEIN_ mrna sequence by _PROTEIN_ pcr indicated that the current gene model is incorrect and that the _PROTEIN_ gene contains a utr of bp followed by a single bp long intron directly adjacent to the translational initiation codon of the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence . a putative _PROTEIN_ box _PROTEIN_ spans positions to and a putative caat box is located at positions to . the predicted _PROTEIN_ protein exhibits all the characteristics of a zn transporting cation diffusion facilitator protein . these include six predicted _LOCATION_ spanning helices cytoplasmic n and c termini a large histidine rich cytoplasmic loop between the fourth and fifth _LOCATION_ spanning helices and a fully conserved c terminal motif _PROTEIN_ . these features are shared with the previously characterized _PROTEIN_ and the uncharacterized proteins whereas the sequences of the remainder of the cdf proteins encoded in the a. thaliana genome are more divergent . to investigate the cellular function of the _PROTEIN_ protein it was _PROTEIN_ in the zn sensitive double mutant of budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae . this mutant lacks two transporters of the cdf family and both of which contribute to the transport of into the yeast _LOCATION_ . growth of cells of the double mutant transformed with an empty vector was inhibited by approximately at mm zn whereas growth of cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ with an n terminally fused triple ha tag was almost unaffected even at the highest concentration of mm zn . growth of cells _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis halleri _PROTEIN_ which was previously shown to complement the mutant was partially inhibited at this zn concentration . these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ can complement the zn sensitivity of the yeast double mutant . in yeast cells _PROTEIN_ could confer zn tolerance in two different ways either by preventing the intracellular accumulation of zn or through intracellular sequestration of zn . in order to determine the basis of _PROTEIN_ mediated zn tolerance we analyzed zn accumulation in the yeast transformants . cells of the mutant are defective in _LOCATION_ zn sequestration . accordingly these cells accumulated on average only about two thirds of the zn accumulated by wild type cells . zn accumulation in double mutant cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was between and of zn accumulation in wild type cells . this suggests that the _PROTEIN_ mediated zn tolerance of yeast cells is based on the intracellular sequestration of zn . to assess whether _PROTEIN_ is capable of the intracellular detoxification of other metal ions we tested its ability to confer tolerance to cd fe _PROTEIN_ mn _PROTEIN_ and co . among these metals _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ conferred tolerance only to co . growth inhibition by more than was found at co concentrations of mm co in cells transformed with the empty vector mm co or higher in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells and at mm co in _PROTEIN_ cells . in a medium containing a non toxic co concentration of co mutant cells accumulated about of the co accumulated in wild type cells . this is consistent with the known ability of to transport cobalt ions into the _LOCATION_ . cells of the mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or and grown at co accumulated on average between and of the co content of wild type cells respectively . this suggests that the co tolerance conferred to cells by _PROTEIN_ was based on intracellular co detoxification rather than co exclusion from cells . to analyze the localization of _PROTEIN_ in plant cells stable transformants of a. thaliana were generated using a construct encoding an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ fusion protein . in seedlings of six independent transformant lines the _METHOD_ signal was detected in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . this suggests that _PROTEIN_ is primarily localized in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of plant cells . this is in agreement with the localization of an _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein transiently _PROTEIN_ in a. thaliana protoplasts isolated from a suspension culture . to further characterize _PROTEIN_ protein function we generated transgenic a. thaliana plants ectopically over _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of a constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . in rosette leaves of adult plants the two lines and contained high concentrations of the _PROTEIN_ protein and the third line contained lower levels . root elongation and _METHOD_ production suggested that all three _PROTEIN_ transformant lines exhibit enhanced zn tolerance when compared to the empty vector line . taken together the root elongation and shoot _METHOD_ data indicated that zn tolerance is higher in lines and than in line suggesting that there is a correlation between _PROTEIN_ protein levels and zn tolerance in plants ectopically over _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . increases in co tolerance were only marginal in lines and . compared to empty vector transformants the accumulation of zn but not of mn or fe was increased in roots and in rosette leaves of seedlings ectopically over _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . this trend was observed in seedlings grown at the control zn concentration of and in seedlings grown at zn but differences were only statistically significant in plants grown at the higher zn concentration . in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings grown in a medium containing co root and shoot co concentrations were approximately twofold higher than in empty vector control seedlings . in mature plants grown on a normal potting soil zn accumulation was higher in rosette leaves of _PROTEIN_ over xpressing plants than in rosette leaves of empty vector transformants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . this is consistent with the data obtained from seedlings . in cauline leaves the inflorescence and siliques of plants ectopically over _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ zn concentrations tended to be lower than in the respective organs of the empty vector transformant line . in _METHOD_ and seeds zn concentrations were equivalent in plants of both genotypes . these experiments showed that ectopic over _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ increases plant zn tolerance and zn accumulation in roots and rosette leaves . in order to determine the function of _PROTEIN_ in planta we decided to first investigate the localization of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ transcript levels in the roots of seedlings were more than tenfold higher than transcript levels in rosette leaves cauline leaves and the inflorescence stem . transcript levels were slightly higher in the inflorescence and in developing siliques than in other above ground tissues of soil grown mature plants . next we determined whether _PROTEIN_ transcript abundance is dependent on plant metal status . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in rosette leaves was very low under all conditions . however in roots _PROTEIN_ transcript abundance changed in response to specific changes in metal status . compared to seedlings grown under control conditions root _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were increased in response to non toxic excesses of zn co and a toxic concentration of mn respectively . _PROTEIN_ transcript abundance also increased approximately threefold following growth on a medium lacking added fe for days . these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ is primarily _PROTEIN_ in the roots and that its steady state transcript levels are up regulated in response to iron deficiency or an excess of mn zn or co. to obtain more precise information about the spatial pattern of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a fusion construct containing the _PROTEIN_ promoter region and the uida gene was introduced into a. thaliana . this construct comprised bp of the genomic region upstream of the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence and the first bp of the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence . the encoded protein is a fusion of the n terminal amino acids of the _PROTEIN_ protein including the two n terminal transmembrane helices and the gus protein . overall gus activity was very low in most analyzed tissues and only detectable after overnight staining . after h of incubation detectable coloration was only apparent in the hypocotyls of day old seedlings and the intensity _PROTEIN_ with seedling age . in leaves petioles and the stem very weak staining could be observed in the vasculature . this staining was localized to the phloem . gus staining was also detected in the anthers and the longer four of the six filaments of opened flowers . in the anthers staining was localized primarily to pollen grains and the vascular bundle . in developing siliques staining was detected in the abscission zones . gus activity was histochemically undetectable in roots of seedlings after growth on control medium . _PROTEIN_ transcript levels determined by quantitative real time rt pcr were about times higher in bulk root tissues than in bulk inflorescence tissues . compared to the highly localized gus _PROTEIN_ within the inflorescence a more widespread localization of gus _PROTEIN_ in roots may locally be below the detection limit of histochemical gus staining . ten day old seedlings of gus plants germinated and grown on media containing excess zn or co or on a medium lacking added fe exhibited intense gus activity staining in the root hair zone of primary and secondary roots . the gus activity was localized in the cortical and epidermal cell layers including root hairs . the apical region of roots displayed no gus activity . by contrast seedlings cultivated on a medium containing excess mn did not exhibit histochemically detectable gus activity . to further investigate metal dependent regulation gus activity was determined in root total protein extracts using methyl umbelliferone as a substrate . compared to gus activity in the roots of day old seedlings grown under control conditions gus activity was clearly detectable and increased in roots grown in the absence of added iron or in the presence of excess co or excess zn . compared to seedlings grown on control medium gus activity was not increased following exposure of seedlings to fehbed or mn although real time pcr experiments suggested that _PROTEIN_ transcript levels increased in response to an excess of mn . it should be noted that gus activity in the gus lines used here requires proper splicing of the intron in the utr of the _PROTEIN_ primary transcript and translation of the first nucleotides of the coding sequence of the _PROTEIN_ transcript that are fused in frame to the transcript of the gus coding sequence . therefore gus activity reports not only promoter activity but will include any regulatory _METHOD_ specified in the _PROTEIN_ sequence included in the construct for example splicing or early events in translation . alternatively a regulatory element of mn dependent _PROTEIN_ transcription or transcript stability may be localized outside the dna fragment used in the construct . it has been proposed that an excess of zn may induce fe deficiency in plants . to test whether the zn dependent increase in _PROTEIN_ promoter activity was a consequence of zn induced internal fe deficiency we analyzed gus activity in plants exposed to excess zn either in the presence of the usual concentration of fehbed or in the presence of a higher fe concentration of fehbed . gus activities were of the same magnitude in both treatments . this indicates that the increase in promoter activity following exposure to an excess of zn was not a consequence of zn induced fe deficiency . compared to control seedlings grown on medium containing zn gus activity was induced in a zn concentration dependent manner following growth on and zn for days . the zn dependent increase in gus activity was slow with a detectable increase after days of exposure to zn followed by an approximately linear increase within the first days of exposure . between days and of exposure a further increase in gus activity occurred at a low rate . in order to understand the role of _PROTEIN_ in a. thaliana we generated plants transformed with an intron spliced hairpin rna construct designed for rna interference mediated silencing of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in three independent transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were reduced to between and of control transcript levels found in empty vector transformants . the sequences of the transcripts of the _PROTEIN_ and genes are most closely related to the _PROTEIN_ sequence with and identity respectively . compared to empty vector transformants _PROTEIN_ and transcript levels were not significantly reduced . transcript levels of were extremely low and this gene should be considered as not _PROTEIN_ in either wild type or transgenic plants under the growth conditions employed . the _PROTEIN_ rnai lines flowered normally and exhibited no reduction in seed set . all three lines grew normally on media containing control levels of zn . at zn a concentration at which wild type a. thaliana are healthy leaf chlorosis was observed in all three _PROTEIN_ rnai lines . the shoot fresh _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ rnai plants was significantly reduced to on average about of the shoot fresh _METHOD_ of seedlings grown in the low zn conditions . by contrast no significant reduction in shoot _METHOD_ production was observed at zn in the empty vector control seedlings . this suggests that _PROTEIN_ has a role in basic zn tolerance in a. thaliana and is not redundant under the conditions employed . the effect of _PROTEIN_ silencing on zn partitioning was analyzed in mature plants grown on soil . in these plants most above ground tissues accumulated higher zn concentrations than empty vector transformants . in rosette leaves cauline leaves the inflorescence and siliques zn concentrations were significantly higher in _PROTEIN_ rna interference plants than in empty vector transformants by between and . this suggests that in wild type a. thaliana plants _PROTEIN_ has a role in controlling root to shoot transfer of zn most likely by immobilizing zn in the _LOCATION_ of cells in the root epidermis and cortex . therefore we tested whether zn concentrations are higher in the shoots of seedlings grown under conditions known to induce an increase in root _PROTEIN_ transcript levels and _PROTEIN_ promoter activity . in day old seedlings grown under conditions of mild fe deficiency or excess zn respectively shoot zn concentrations were and fold higher in _PROTEIN_ rnai seedlings than in empty vector control seedlings . these results substantiate the idea that _PROTEIN_ participates in the exclusion of zn from the shoot of wild type plants . mn concentrations were not significantly altered in the _PROTEIN_ rnai lines further supporting the hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ does not transport mn .
