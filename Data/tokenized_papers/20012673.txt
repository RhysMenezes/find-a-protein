_LOCATION_ associated proteins snares provide the minimal fusion machinery necessary for cellular vesicles to fuse to target organelle _LOCATION_ in eukaryotic cells . despite the conserved nature of the fusion machinery in all eukaryotes it still remains _PROTEIN_ to identify functional snare pairs in higher plants . we developed a method based on a split luciferase complementation assay for detecting changes in snare snare interaction by luminescence within arabidopsis protoplasts that _PROTEIN_ recombinant proteins at physiological levels in well plates . the reliability of the assay was confirmed by three experiments . first reduction of the snare snare interaction caused by a single amino acid substitution adjacent to the snare motif in endosome localized _PROTEIN_ was detected by a reduction of luminescence . second reduction of the interaction between _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in response to sodium azide was detected in real time . third the results of snare pairs investigated by this method largely agreed with the results from previously reported co immunoprecipitation assays . using the method we newly identified the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was significantly increased when the protoplasts were incubated in the light . microscopic observation of transgenic arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ from its own promoter suggested that the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ by light . these suggested that the vesicle trafficking pathway mediated by _PROTEIN_ might be regulated by light in arabidopsis . in general this article demonstrated the method that can generate new biological insight of the snare protein interactions in plant cells .
the rationale for the split luciferase complementation assay is depicted in fig . . in our slc assay renilla luciferase is split into a amino acid amino terminal fragment and an amino acid _PROTEIN_ terminal fragment . these fragments are fused to the n terminal ends of bait and prey snares through a flexible linker plus the sequence required for the in vitro recombination . as a consequence the calculated sizes of the tags are kda for the amino terminal fragment tag and kda for the _PROTEIN_ terminal fragment tag respectively . the slc assay utilizes the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter to _PROTEIN_ snare proteins in arabidopsis protoplasts . a notable drawback of this promoter is that it tends to overexpress fused genes . gene overexpression may cause mis localization or aggregation in selected snares in arabidopsis potentially resulting in malfunctions in vesicle trafficking . we attempted to minimize overexpression of split luciferase tagged snares in protoplasts by altering the amount of vector dna introduced to the cells . to quantify the accumulation of recombinant proteins we conducted semi quantitative immunoblot analyses with antibodies that specially recognized qc snare _PROTEIN_ and qa snare _PROTEIN_ respectively . these snares are known to form a tetrameric snare complex with qb snare _PROTEIN_ and r snare _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ trafficking pathway in arabidopsis . we identified endogenous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ at and kda respectively as previously reported . we also detected cluc _PROTEIN_ and cluc _PROTEIN_ at their predicted protein sizes . two extra bands just below the signal at kda in the blot with anti _PROTEIN_ antibody indicated that some of cluc _PROTEIN_ protein might degrade . however because faint bands at this level were detected in the mock transformed protoplasts _PROTEIN_ we were not able to address exactly what these bands were in these experiments . the relative signal intensities of the antibody label show that the accumulation levels of cluc _PROTEIN_ and cluc _PROTEIN_ were and fold higher than their endogenous counterparts when protoplasts were transected with of the prey and bait vectors . however we were able to detect luminescence with high signal to background ratios in these conditions . similarly three independent experiments showed that cluc _PROTEIN_ and cluc _PROTEIN_ accumulated less than threefold over their endogenous protein levels . therefore we used the transformation conditions established in this analysis for other snare proteins as well unless specific conditions are mentioned in this report . an interaction of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was previously identified by co immunoprecipitation assay . using the same assay it was also shown that a single amino acid substitute of _PROTEIN_ in the fifth amino acid upstream of the snare motif _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ reduced interactions with _PROTEIN_ . to test whether the slc assay can resolve changes in these interactions at this level we measured the interaction of cluc _PROTEIN_ with nluc _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and nluc _PROTEIN_ . we transformed protoplasts with of the bait vector _PROTEIN_ cluc _PROTEIN_ and various amounts of the prey vector _PROTEIN_ either nluc _PROTEIN_ or nluc _PROTEIN_ . because the accumulation levels of the recombinant proteins positively correlate with the vector amounts transformed we assumed that the vector amount represented the levels of recombinant proteins accumulated in the cells in this experiment . we then compared the normalized rlus . in this experiment we co transformed a vector that _PROTEIN_ click beetle red luciferase that uses a different substrate from spilt luciferase and emits red luminescence . hence the cyan luminescence from split luciferase was divided by the red luminescence to normalize rlus in each transformation defined as the normalized cyan/red rlu thereafter . the plots revealed that the normalized cyan/red rlus of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction were about half that of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction . for example when of the prey vector was transformed the normalized cyan/red rlu of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction was fold lower than that of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction . we also found that the amount of nluc _PROTEIN_ protein accumulated in the transformed protoplasts was slightly higher than that of nluc _PROTEIN_ in immunoblots . it is presently not clear why the nluc _PROTEIN_ protein accumulates at higher levels than the nluc _PROTEIN_ protein . nevertheless these results indicate that the slc assay can detect a _PROTEIN_ in snare snare interactions caused by a single amino acid substitution . to determine whether the slc assay can detect changes in snare snare interactions in real time we measured effects of _PROTEIN_ on the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ form a tetrameric snare complex with _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis to secrete anti fungal compounds at a location where powdery mildew fungi invade . fusion between secretary vesicles and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ depends on _PROTEIN_ in neuroendocrine cells . moreover previous studies suggest that _PROTEIN_ is involved in the plant response to the invasion of powdery mildew fungi into the cells . therefore we reasoned that addition of sodium azide an _PROTEIN_ synthase inhibitor during the measurement of luminescence would _PROTEIN_ the rlus of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction . because sodium azide causes many cellular processes to be malfunction the experiment was not designed to demonstrate the specificity of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction rather than to demonstrate the capability of detecting changes of the snare snare interaction in real time . the normalized cyan/red rlu between nluc _PROTEIN_ and cluc _PROTEIN_ was . in this experiment only the rlu of split luciferase was measured because the activity of click beetle red luciferase depends _PROTEIN_ . typically the rlus of split luciferase increased for min after adding viviren then _PROTEIN_ gradually . therefore for this experiment we waited to add the sodium azide until after the luminescence had reached its highest point . we here show a time course in these experiments in which the highest luminescence before adding sodium azide is defined as rlu . our time course experiments indicated that the rlus of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction rapidly _PROTEIN_ with sodium azide but not with the mock . unexpectedly rlus of full length renilla luciferase temporarily increased in response to sodium azide . we believe that this was _PROTEIN_ due to a rapid increase in the concentration of the substrate in the _LOCATION_ caused by the malfunction of _PROTEIN_ dependent channels in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ which could regulate the transport of viviren . this indicated that the sodium azide dependent reduction of the rlus of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction might be more rapid than the data reveal . _PROTEIN_ of this finding these results indicate that the slc assay can detect a reduction of snare snare interactions in real time . furthermore the reduction of the luminescence was not due to a _PROTEIN_ in recombinant proteins because immunoblots detected little difference in the accumulation levels of the proteins in the presence and absence of sodium azide . to further test the robustness of the slc assay we compared our results to co immunoprecipitation assays reported by sanderfoot et al . and kwon et al . . we found that of the interaction data from the slc assay with an arbitrary threshold of a normalized cyan/red rlu agreed with the results of the co immunoprecipitation assay . this agreement is _PROTEIN_ of the type of snare the protein sizes and localizations _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the threshold was chosen based on the data of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction that showed the lowest normalized cyan/red rlu among the positive snare pairs in the co immunoprecipitation assays _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and that of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction that showed the highest normalized cyan/red rlu among the negative snare pairs in the co immunoprecipitation assays _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . this arbitrary threshold gave the highest agreement between the slc and co immunoprecipitation assay . based on this threshold we newly identified snare pairs that would interact in cells . these includes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as the interaction partners of _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ because the normalized cyan/red rlus of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interactions are significantly higher than the threshold . for supporting our findings the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction was recently identified by immunoprecipitation assay . this suggests that the slc assay is capable of identifying novel snare snare interactions . lastly to elucidate a novel insight of snare interactions in plant cells by the slc assay we conducted a screening with various snare pairs and conditions that are physiologically relevant to plants . four independent transformations were used to generate a result of one condition in one snare pair . typically we added a biochemical or mock solution into four wells in a well plate where protoplasts _PROTEIN_ the same snare pair were incubated in the solution in the wells . the plate was then incubated for a defined time before measuring luminescence . the biochemicals we used included abscisic acid auxin gibberellin flg peptide and hydrogen peroxide _PROTEIN_ from the experiments for the mapk cascade signaling network . we also used calcium chloride and sodium chloride . alternatively protoplasts were transformed with the same vectors in two well plates . the two plates were then independently incubated in different conditions for h. the incubation conditions included temperature and light . the results of the assay were varied depending on the snare pairs and the biochemical/incubation conditions we used . in this report we show a change of the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ by light which led us to the further investigation in plants . the slc screening revealed that the rlu of split luciferase between nluc _PROTEIN_ and cluc _PROTEIN_ was significantly increased when the transformed protoplasts were incubated under the light although the rlu of full length renilla luciferase was little changed under the same conditions . other snare pairs examined also showed a trend of increased rlus under the light . however their changes were not significantly different from that in full length renilla luciferase . for instance nluc _PROTEIN_ qa snare localized in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ showed the positive interaction with cluc similar to nluc _PROTEIN_ and cluc _PROTEIN_ . the rlu of split luciferase between nluc _PROTEIN_ and cluc _PROTEIN_ under the light was fold higher than that under the dark at the average of the three different experiments but the change was not significantly different from that in full length renilla luciferase . this suggested that the significant increase of the split luciferase rlu occurred specifically in the interaction between nluc _PROTEIN_ and cluc _PROTEIN_ among the snare pairs tested . because the promoter is not regulated by light in protoplasts this result also suggested that the increase might occur at the post transcriptional level . we sought to test whether or not the light regulation of the interaction identified through the protoplasts based scl assay was true in plants as well . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ all localize in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in both protoplasts and plants . based on the results of the scl assay we hypothesized that the _PROTEIN_ interaction but not the _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ is regulated by light . although we wish to analyze these interactions in planta we have not been able to obtain the result due to absence of materials such as specific antibodies for each snare or transgenic arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ epitope tagged snares in our hands at this point . alternatively we analyzed transgenic arabidopsis plants that _PROTEIN_ either _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ from their own promoters to identify the subcellular localizations of these snares in plants . we reasoned that if the _PROTEIN_ interaction is specifically regulated by light at the post transcriptional level in plants as well we may see some changes in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ but not _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in plants grown in the dark . based on this working model we examined _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the seedlings that were grown in the dark or the light . microscopic observation of the roots indicates that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the dark grown seedlings does not localize in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but in an other compartment that is most likely the _LOCATION_ . furthermore we found that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ bfa compartments a marker for recycling endosomes in the light grown seedlings . on the other hand _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is localized in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in both the dark and light grown seedlings and does not form the bfa compartments . these suggest that the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ may be regulated by light and the protein recycling mechanism in the arabidopsis seedling roots . although we are not able to address whether the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is regulated by light in plants at this point this in planta experiment encourages further investigation on the light regulation in the snare interactions .
protoplasts were prepared from rosette leaves of weeks old arabidopsis thaliana as we described previously . when subcellular localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were analyzed seeds of arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ from their own promoters were germinated on a agar plate containing murashige skoog salts and incubated in a walk in chamber for days . to germinate the seedlings in the dark the plates were kept in a cardboard box covered by aluminum foil in the same chamber . snare cdnas were previously subcloned or obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center . the coding sequences in the cdnas were amplified by pcr with primers for subcloning into the pdonr/zeo vector . the resultant vectors were used to subclone the coding sequences into or _PROTEIN_ vectors . the nluc _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ vector was generated based on the nluc _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ vector with the in vitro site directed mutagenesis kit . protoplasts transformations were conducted as we described previously with minor modifications . the bait prey vectors suspended in of water were used to transfect protoplasts in of the mmg buffer . when changes of the split luciferase luminescence was monitored in real time of the bait vector and of the prey vector suspended in of water were used . split luciferase luminescence was measuring as we described previously with minor modifications . when changes of the split luciferase luminescence was monitored in real time of viviren the renilla luciferase substrate was added to wells of well plates in which protoplasts were suspended in of the incubation solution in each well . relative luminescence units were measured by a microplate luminometer _METHOD_ with fastest scan intervals . ten micro litter of mm sodium azide was added in the wells soon after the luminescence from the transformed protoplasts reached the highest . the plate was then quickly return to the luminometer . accordingly the exact timing of sodium azide addition and luminescence sampling were varied by experiments . to compensate the independent transformation number was increased and the experiment was repeated to confirm the similar changes of the luminescence intensities . when the transformed protoplasts were exposed to light a well plate was incubated in a reach in chamber . the other well plate was kept in a cardboard box covered by aluminum foil to incubate the protoplasts in the dark in the same chamber . luminescence was measured with a s integration period in a microplate luminometer . when the split luciferase luminescence was normalized by transformation efficiency of pmont the vector _PROTEIN_ the full length click beetle red luciferase from the promoter was co transformed with the bait prey vectors . after the split luciferase luminescence was measured of mm beetle luciferase substrate luciferin was added to each well . the luminescence from the beetle luciferase activity was measured through a red filter with a s integration period using the veritas microplate luminometer min after the substrate was added . no bleed through occurs from the cyan to the red filter in our conditions . rlus of split luciferase were divided by the rlus of beetle red luciferase . immunoblot was conducted as we previously described with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ nluc or _METHOD_ specific antibodies . when signal intensities on the blots were analyzed the x ray _METHOD_ were scanned and analyzed by imagej . _METHOD_ microscopy on the transgenic plants was conducted as we described previously . when the formation of the bfa compartments was tested the seedlings were floated on a petri dish containing of brefeldin a for h before the observation .
