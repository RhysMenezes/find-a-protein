chloroplast division in plant cells is orchestrated by a complex macromolecular machine with components positioned on both the inner and outer envelope surfaces . the only _LOCATION_ division proteins identified to date are of endosymbiotic origin and are localized inside the organelle . employing positional cloning methods in arabidopsis in conjunction with a novel strategy for pinpointing the mutant locus we have identified a gene encoding a new chloroplast division protein _PROTEIN_ . mutants of _PROTEIN_ exhibit defects in chloroplast constriction have enlarged dumbbell shaped chloroplasts and are rescued by a wild type copy of _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ gene product shares similarity with the dynamin family of _PROTEIN_ which mediate endocytosis mitochondrial division and other organellar fission and fusion events in eukaryotes . phylogenetic analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ is related to a group of dynamin like proteins unique to plants . a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein localizes to a _PROTEIN_ at the chloroplast division site . chloroplast import and protease protection assays indicate that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is positioned on the outer surface of the chloroplast . thus _PROTEIN_ is the first _LOCATION_ component of the chloroplast division complex to be identified . _PROTEIN_ has no obvious counterparts in prokaryotes suggesting that it evolved from a dynamin related protein present in the eukaryotic ancestor of plants . these results indicate that the chloroplast division apparatus is of mixed evolutionary origin and that it shares structural and mechanistic similarities with both the cell division machinery of bacteria and the dynamin mediated organellar fission machineries of eukaryotes .
like other chloroplast division mutants leaf mesophyll cells in _PROTEIN_ mutants contain fewer and larger chloroplasts than do wild type cells which have about chloroplasts at maturity . the _PROTEIN_ mutant has been reported to contain an average of chloroplasts in fully expanded mesophyll cells although the phenotype appears somewhat more variable in our hands with _PROTEIN_ cells typically containing between and chloroplasts . this difference may reflect differences in growth conditions . chloroplast number is fairly uniform within an individual _PROTEIN_ plant and as shown for other arc mutants chloroplast size in _PROTEIN_ varies inversely with chloroplast number . as has been reported previously _PROTEIN_ chloroplasts frequently remain dumbbell shaped . _PROTEIN_ was previously mapped to a region of chromosome flanked by the markers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . we generated a new mapping population and used standard methods to fine map the _PROTEIN_ locus to a kb interval corresponding to two overlapping bac clones and _PROTEIN_ . this interval contained predicted genes but no clear _PROTEIN_ candidate . to identify the gene most likely to represent _PROTEIN_ we digested and _PROTEIN_ with restriction enzymes and subcloned the resulting fragments between the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter and octopine synthase terminator in a derivative of the plant transformation vector creating a library of fragments spanning the _PROTEIN_ containing interval . the library was designed such that at least one fragment from each predicted gene in the interval would be ligated to the vector in the antisense orientation with the expectation that an antisense fragment from _PROTEIN_ would yield an _PROTEIN_ like phenotype . the library was used to transform wild type arabidopsis plants and transgenic plants were screened for chloroplast division defects by microscopy . among independent individuals examined two had fewer and larger chloroplasts per cell than wild type and resembled _PROTEIN_ . the inserts carried by the transgenes in these two transgenic lines were amplified by pcr and sequenced . two different inserts were detected in both lines . one line carried a fragment derived from the bac backbone dna and a second fragment derived from on . the other line carried a fragment from _GENE_ on as well as the same fragment from . in both plants the fragment was present in the antisense orientation . to confirm that the _PROTEIN_ like _LOCATION_ division phenotype in the two transgenic lines was caused by the shared fragment we constructed a transgene containing this fragment in the antisense orientation and introduced it into wild type arabidopsis . of transgenic plants examined under the microscope had chloroplast division defects similar to those of _PROTEIN_ and the transgenic line shown in fig . fig refe . these findings indicated that the _PROTEIN_ gene corresponded to . has homology to the dynamin family of _PROTEIN_ . in the arabidopsis database and the immediately adjacent sequence _GENE_ were annotated as separate genes . however sequence alignments to other dynamin like proteins as well as est data from arabidopsis and other plants strongly suggested they were parts of a single gene referred to hereafter as _GENE_ and that the annotated start codon for and stop codon for _GENE_ represented the true start and stop codons of this gene . this was confirmed by subsequent cdna isolation and analysis . to establish whether _PROTEIN_ contained a mutation in this region of the genome we sequenced the _GENE_ locus in both the _PROTEIN_ mutant and in wild type landsberg _LOCATION_ . the data showed the presence in _PROTEIN_ of a g to a mutation which altered a tryptophan codon to a stop codon . we then introduced a transgene containing the predicted _GENE_ locus plus kb and kb of the and flanking dna respectively into _PROTEIN_ mutants to determine whether the wild type dna could complement the _PROTEIN_ mutation . microscopic analysis of transgenic plants indicated that the chloroplast division defect in the mutant was fully or partially rescued by the wild type transgene . differences in gene dosage resulting from position effects probably account for the partial complementation in some individuals . taken together the point mutation in _GENE_ in _PROTEIN_ complementation of the mutant phenotype by the wild type gene and ability of a fragment from _GENE_ to confer an _PROTEIN_ like phenotype in wild type plants when _PROTEIN_ in the antisense orientation indicate that the _PROTEIN_ locus and _GENE_ represent the same gene . to gain more information on the _PROTEIN_ transcription unit and encoded polypeptide we used rt pcr and primers spanning from bp upstream to bp downstream of the predicted _GENE_ start and stop codons respectively to amplify the corresponding cdna . sequence analysis revealed two distinct cdna species . the longer cdna contained a sequence that was spliced out of the shorter cdna as the intron however its presence in the longer cdna did not interrupt the reading frame . more than half of the cdna clones recovered were of this type . this cdna encoded a protein of aa and kda . the protein can be aligned over its entire length with numerous members of the dynamin family and contains three motifs found in other dynamin like proteins a conserved n terminal _PROTEIN_ domain a pleckstrin homology domain shown in some proteins to mediate _LOCATION_ association and a c terminal _PROTEIN_ effector domain thought to interact directly with the _PROTEIN_ domain and to mediate self assembly . the shorter cdna encoded a protein of aa and kda identical to that of the larger gene product except for the absence of aa encoded by the sequence of the intron . these results suggest that the _PROTEIN_ transcript is alternatively spliced . alternative splicing of dynamin genes in several other _METHOD_ has also been documented . because the shorter gene product lacks a portion of the ph domain the proteins encoded by the two splice variants may have different activities or localization patterns . phylogenetic analysis was performed to investigate the relationship between _PROTEIN_ and other members of the dynamin family of proteins . only full length sequences were used although est data indicate that related proteins are present in many plants and in green algae . _PROTEIN_ clustered with a group of proteins found in plants but was in a distinct clade from other dynamin like proteins in arabidopsis with functions in cell plate formation and mitochondrial division . surprisingly the _PROTEIN_ like proteins clustered near _PROTEIN_ another arabidopsis dynamin like protein involved in vesicle trafficking from the transgolgi network to the _LOCATION_ in plants . this suggests that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ could share a common dynamin like ancestor . based on the similarity of _PROTEIN_ to dynamin and its relatives we conclude that _PROTEIN_ represents a new class of a dynamin like proteins that functions specifically in chloroplast division . we _PROTEIN_ a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein in transgenic plants to investigate the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ . because overexpression of chloroplast ftsz proteins can result in a dominant negative phenotype we used the native _PROTEIN_ promoter to create the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgene for _PROTEIN_ in wild type plants . _METHOD_ microscopy showed that the fusion protein was localized in a _PROTEIN_ like pattern at the site of the chloroplast constriction . this _PROTEIN_ could be faintly detected in unconstricted chloroplasts suggesting that _PROTEIN_ may act at an earlier stage of division than previously hypothesized . however _PROTEIN_ is not required for ftsz _PROTEIN_ formation the earliest known event in the assembly of the chloroplast division apparatus because the ftsz _PROTEIN_ can be detected in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was most obvious in visibly constricted chloroplasts perhaps as a consequence of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ during constriction . similar localization patterns have been described for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . however in contrast to the ftsz _PROTEIN_ which are fairly uniform in _METHOD_ intensity the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was more speckled in appearance suggesting that _PROTEIN_ localization at the division site may be discontinuous or that the _PROTEIN_ containing _PROTEIN_ is not of uniform composition . even though _PROTEIN_ mediates chloroplast division it is not predicted by subcellular targeting prediction _METHOD_ to be imported to the chloroplast . to further define the topology of the _PROTEIN_ containing _PROTEIN_ with respect to the chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ we used in vitro chloroplast import and protease protection assays . a radiolabeled translation product corresponding to the longer _PROTEIN_ cdna was generated by coupled transcription/translation then incubated with isolated pea chloroplasts . subsequent fractionation of the chloroplasts indicated that the translation product was associated with the _LOCATION_ fraction but was not processed . the binding of the _PROTEIN_ translation product to isolated chloroplasts may be effected in part by the ph domain which has been shown to mediate lipid binding of other dynamin like proteins . in contrast two chloroplast targeted control proteins one localized to the inner envelope and the other to the stroma were processed on import consistent with the presence of n terminal transit peptides and associated with the _LOCATION_ and soluble chloroplast fractions respectively . in addition the two control proteins were both protected from proteolysis by thermolysin which does not penetrate the outer envelope whereas the _PROTEIN_ translation product was fully degraded by this protease . these data provide evidence that the _PROTEIN_ containing _PROTEIN_ represented by the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein is situated on the _LOCATION_ surface of the outer chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ . the position of _PROTEIN_ on the chloroplast surface is topologically equivalent to that of a dynamin like protein that mediates mitochondrial division in yeast .
