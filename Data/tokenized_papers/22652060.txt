it is well known that abscisic acid promotes reactive oxygen species production through _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ associated nadph oxidases during aba signaling . however whether ros from organelles can act as second messengers in aba signaling is largely unknown . here we identified an aba overly sensitive mutant _PROTEIN_ in a genetic screen for aba mediated inhibition of primary root growth . _PROTEIN_ encodes a dexh box rna helicase that is involved in regulating the splicing of several genes of complex i in mitochondria . the _PROTEIN_ mutant accumulated more ros in mitochondria as established using a mitochondrial superoxide indicator circularly permuted yellow _METHOD_ protein . two dominant negative mutations in aba _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ greatly reduced ros production in mitochondria . the aba sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ can also be compromised by the _PROTEIN_ mutation . aba mediated inhibition of seed germination and primary root growth in _PROTEIN_ was released by the addition of reduced gsh and exogenous auxin to the medium . _PROTEIN_ of auxin responsive markers gus _PROTEIN_ and indole acetic acid gus was greatly reduced by the _PROTEIN_ mutation . hence our results provide molecular evidence for the interplay between aba and auxin through the production of ros from mitochondria . this interplay regulates primary root growth and seed germination in arabidopsis thaliana .
_PROTEIN_ was isolated during a genetic screen for aba sensitive mutants the screen used a root bending assay on murashige and skoog _METHOD_ medium containing aba . we compared the root growth of d old wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings transferred onto _METHOD_ medium supplemented with different concentrations of aba for d. as shown in figures and although _PROTEIN_ had shorter primary roots than the wild type on _METHOD_ medium without aba primary root growth was more sensitive in _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type to aba . in addition seed germination greening was more sensitive in _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type to aba and to nacl and mannitol . _PROTEIN_ plants were _PROTEIN_ flowering than the wild type . we analyzed whether _PROTEIN_ was more drought resistant than the wild type . _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants were grown in pots under water sufficient conditions . after weeks the plants were subjected to drought stress by withholding water . after d of drought treatment the wild type leaves showed clear wilting signs but _PROTEIN_ leaves remained turgid . because the _PROTEIN_ mutants were slightly smaller than the wild type plants and because leaf surface area affects the rate of transpiration from leaves we measured the water loss of detached leaves so as to obtain a direct measure of transpiration . the rate of water loss was slower from detached _PROTEIN_ leaves than from detached wild type leaves which was consistent with the drought tolerant phenotype of _PROTEIN_ plants growing in soil . under water sufficient conditions the stomatal apertures of _PROTEIN_ were smaller than those of the wild type . we also found that pro and soluble sugar contents were greater in _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type under both water sufficient and drought conditions . these results suggest that the _PROTEIN_ mutant suffers from constitutive stress and also partially explain its drought tolerant phenotype . the _PROTEIN_ mutant was crossed with the landsberg accession . the seedlings that showed aba sensitivity in root growth _METHOD_ were selected . _PROTEIN_ was initially mapped to the upper arm of chromosome and was precisely mapped to the bac clones and _PROTEIN_ . we sequenced all of the open reading frames in this region and identified a _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ mutation in the sixth exon of _PROTEIN_ this mutation caused a _PROTEIN_ to change in _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was annotated as a dead box rna helicase that contains a dexh box . there are dead box proteins in arabidopsis most of which belong to the family a family that is divided into dead deah and dexd/h subfamilies . the _PROTEIN_ mutation gly to glu occurs in the dexh region . gly is a well conserved amino acid in the dexh region of _PROTEIN_ homologs from different species . the cdna of _PROTEIN_ was amplified and overexpressed under the control of a super promoter in _PROTEIN_ . we obtained independent transgenic lines and selected several homozygous lines to test for aba sensitivity of root growth all were rescued to the wild type phenotype on _METHOD_ medium containing aba . as an example the homozygous transgenic line complemented both the aba sensitive phenotype and the retarded growth phenotype indicating that the aba sensitive phenotype of _PROTEIN_ was caused by the mutation in _PROTEIN_ . we obtained t dna lines but failed to obtain homozygous t dna insertion plants suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is required for plant survival . we crossed _PROTEIN_ with a heterozygous t dna mutant and analyzed the plants for root sensitivity to aba . we found that the ratio of normal plants to sensitive plants was near . the aba sensitive plants were heterozygous in that they carried both the _PROTEIN_ mutation and the t dna insertion . together these results confirmed that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is predicted to localize to mitochondria according to the program targetp . to verify this result we fused the n terminus of the _PROTEIN_ cdna fragment in frame with green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ under the control of a super promoter . the constructs were transiently transformed into arabidopsis protoplasts stained with mitotracker red a dye that specifically accumulates in mitochondria . the green _METHOD_ of the fusion protein was colocalized with the _METHOD_ of the mitotracker red indicating that _PROTEIN_ is targeted to mitochondria . to determine the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ we performed quantitative rt pcr . we found that _PROTEIN_ transcripts were more abundant in roots and flowers than in leaves and _METHOD_ . interestingly the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was reduced by aba treatment which is consistent with the public microarray data suggesting that it has a role in the aba response pathway . dead box rna helicases have been implicated in a variety of rna metabolic processes including rna synthesis rna modification rna cleavage and rna degradation . because _PROTEIN_ is targeted to mitochondria we wanted to determine whether it participates in mitochondrial rna metabolism . among the nine mitochondria encoded nad genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ require cis splicing and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ require both cis and trans splicing . we found that the _PROTEIN_ mutation impaired rna splicing in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but not in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ or in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes that are required for splicing but not in complex i . the transcripts of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were more abundant in _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type . the high accumulation of mitochondrial transcripts is also found in other mutants such as _PROTEIN_ in which a _PROTEIN_ gene required for rna editing of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is mutated . however the reason for this is not known . we further used quantitative rt pcr to determine the effect of the _PROTEIN_ mutation on splicing sites . for _PROTEIN_ the splicing in all four introns was greatly reduced in _PROTEIN_ and the transcripts of each intron were more abundant in _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type . for _PROTEIN_ splicing was not affected in the first and second intron but was impaired in the third and fourth intron the abundance of transcripts of the first and second introns was not changed but the abundance of transcripts of the third and fourth introns was increased . for _PROTEIN_ the cis splicing in all three introns was significantly reduced and the intron _PROTEIN_ was higher in _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type . for _PROTEIN_ the third exon is very short and the primers were designed to cover the second and fourth exons . both the cis and trans splicing were reduced in _PROTEIN_ and transcripts of the corresponding introns were increased . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is involved in both cis and trans splicing of some nad genes . we also found that aba treatment reduced the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but had no effect on the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . impairment of complex i in mitochondria would result in respiratory dysfunction and would elicit the production of excess ros . to detect ros production from mitochondria we generated transgenic arabidopsis plants that harbored a mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ targeted superoxide indicator mito _METHOD_ that emits strong _METHOD_ in the presence of the superoxides found in mitochondria with superoxide in mitochondria but not with other ros or not in other cell organelles . in the absence of aba treatment _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ emitted stronger _METHOD_ than the wild type/mito _METHOD_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ accumulated a higher level of ros than the wild type . aba treatment induced higher levels of _METHOD_ in both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and wild type/mito _METHOD_ than no aba treatment and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ emitted stronger _METHOD_ than wild type/mito _METHOD_ . quantification of intensities verified that _PROTEIN_ produced more ros than did the wild type with or without aba treatment . nitroblue tetrazolium staining of root tips supported these results under both normal conditions and aba treatment . these results indicate that aba induces the accumulation of ros in mitochondria and _PROTEIN_ mutation leads to increased ros accumulation in mitochondria . we used diaminobenzidine staining to examine ros in leaves and found that the concentration of ros was higher in _PROTEIN_ leaves than in wild type leaves . aba and drought treatment induced more ros in _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type . similar results were obtained when we used dab staining to measure ros accumulation with and without aba treatment in primary roots . dichlorodihydrofluorescin diacetate _PROTEIN_ staining _METHOD_ and its quantification in primary root tips confirmed the higher accumulation of ros in _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type with and without aba treatment . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ mutants accumulate more ros than the wild type in both leaves and roots and that aba treatment enhances ros production . ros produced in mitochondria usually act as retrograde signals to induce the _PROTEIN_ of some _LOCATION_ genes including alternative oxidase and type ii nad h dehydrogenases . we tested the gene _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and the b class nadh dehydrogenase gene family _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and the wild type . as shown in figure the transcripts of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were several times more abundant in _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type under normal growth conditions . aba treatment increased the transcripts of these four genes in both _PROTEIN_ and the wild type . to determine whether the ros produced from mitochondria can act as second messengers that inhibit primary root growth we compared the primary root growth of the _PROTEIN_ mutant with that of the wild type on _METHOD_ medium supplemented with a ros scavenging reagent reduced gsh . as shown in figures and relative primary root growth was similar for the wild type and _PROTEIN_ on _METHOD_ medium containing gsh or gsh . as shown above aba greatly inhibited the primary root growth of _PROTEIN_ while the relative primary root growth of _PROTEIN_ was comparable with that of the wild type on _METHOD_ medium supplemented with aba plus gsh or gsh . the addition of different concentrations of gsh to the medium also released the aba inhibition of _PROTEIN_ seed germination . previous studies suggested that a gsh pool is important for mediating plant growth . to determine whether the response of _PROTEIN_ to gsh was specific or was representative of its response to other ros scavenging agents we investigated whether another ros scavenging agent dtt could also recover the aba sensitive phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ . the addition of dtt did not apparently affect the primary root growth of the wild type and _PROTEIN_ but clearly released the aba inhibition of primary root growth in both _PROTEIN_ and the wild type and made the relative root growth of _PROTEIN_ comparable to that of the wild type . the addition of dtt weakly inhibited primary root growth of the wild type but not of _PROTEIN_ and released the aba inhibition of primary root growth of _PROTEIN_ and the wild type . the addition of dtt also reduced the inhibition of seed germination greening caused by aba treatment in _PROTEIN_ . we further compared two other mutants and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ on _METHOD_ medium supplemented with gsh or dtt . two mutants are sensitive to aba in seed germination and root growth . the addition of gsh or dtt to the _METHOD_ medium released the aba inhibition of both seed germination and primary root growth in the two mutants to a similar degree as in _PROTEIN_ . these results suggest that the oxidation status is important for aba inhibition of seed germination and primary root growth . we further tested whether a specific nontoxic inhibitor of glutamylcysteine synthetases bso could impact the growth of _PROTEIN_ and the wild type . the root growth of _PROTEIN_ was more resistant to bso than that of the wild type which is consistent with other complex i defective mutants such as _PROTEIN_ which is defective in splicing of intron of the _PROTEIN_ transcript which is disrupted in the splicing of an intron in maturase and a _PROTEIN_ anhydrase mutant . the resistance to bso is consistent with the higher accumulation of gsh under bso treatment in _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type but the mechanism explaining why complex i mutants with higher gsh are resistant to bso is unknown . these results suggest that at least the gsh pool in these mutants is not lower than that in the wild type under aba or bso treatment . increased bso combined with aba had an additive effect on the inhibition of root growth in both _PROTEIN_ and the wild type indicating that bso enhancement of oxidative stress increases aba mediated inhibition of root growth . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ encode protein phosphatases which are important components in early aba signaling . the dominant negative mutations in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ block the interaction of _PROTEIN_ aba receptors with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ resulting in the inhibition of aba signal transduction . in the _PROTEIN_ mutant aba induced ros accumulation is greatly reduced in guard cells while in the _PROTEIN_ mutant aba induced ros accumulation is normal in guard cells but the ros signal can not be transmitted to downstream targets to regulate stomatal movement . we used _METHOD_ superoxide indicator to compare ros accumulation in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the wild type . as shown in figures and both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ emitted less _METHOD_ than _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or wild type/mito _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ emitted more _METHOD_ than _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ but much less than _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or wild type/mito _METHOD_ . aba treatment resulted in more _METHOD_ than no aba treatment in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants . nbt staining of root tips confirmed these results both under normal conditions and aba treatment . because _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are in the landsberg _LOCATION_ accession we also included ler in our analysis . the primary roots of ler produced more ros than those of columbia which might partially explain the greater aba sensitivity of ler than columbia in both seed germination greening and primary root growth . next we performed both dab and _PROTEIN_ da staining to analyze ros production . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ accumulated less ros in roots than the wild type under aba treatment or no aba treatment _PROTEIN_ suggesting that ros production regulated by _PROTEIN_ in roots is different from that in guard cells . aba treatment increased ros accumulation in all plants . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants produced more ros than _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ respectively which all accumulated less ros than the wild type or _PROTEIN_ under aba treatment or no aba treatment . the primary roots of ler accumulated more than those of columbia . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants were resistant to aba inhibition of primary root growth and seed germination greening which was not caused by a change in the accumulation of gsh in roots . as previous studies have indicated that aba regulates ros production at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ our results suggest that the early aba signaling components _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ also regulate ros production from mitochondria . the arabidopsis genome contains nadph oxidase catalytic subunit genes . a previous study indicated that aba evaluates ros production by regulating the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ nadph oxidases _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . to determine the contribution of the mitochondrial ros made by _PROTEIN_ to the cellular response we performed a phenotypic analysis of _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ mutant which is insensitive to aba in _METHOD_ of primary root growth . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed similar aba sensitivity as _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ of seed germination indicating that _PROTEIN_ dominates the seed germination . the primary root growth of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was faster than that of _PROTEIN_ but slower than the wild type and _PROTEIN_ under normal conditions . the primary root growth of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was less inhibited by aba than was _PROTEIN_ indicating that the _PROTEIN_ mutant could alleviate the aba inhibition of primary root growth of _PROTEIN_ . under both aba and no aba treatment _PROTEIN_ accumulated similar levels of superoxide in mitochondria as the wild type as detected by mito _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ accumulated a similar level of superoxides in mitochondria as _PROTEIN_ in normal conditions and less than _PROTEIN_ upon aba treatment . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ affects superoxide accumulation in mitochondria under aba treatment . nbt staining showed similar superoxide accumulation patterns as mito _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . upon dab staining _PROTEIN_ accumulated less in root tips than the wild type in both the presence and absence of exogenously applied aba while _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ accumulated similar levels of as _PROTEIN_ in the absence of aba treatment less than _PROTEIN_ under aba treatment more than _PROTEIN_ in both the presence and absence of aba treatment more than the wild type under normal conditions and similar as the wild type under aba treatment . _PROTEIN_ da staining and showed similar accumulation patterns in all phenotypes as dab staining . taken together these results suggest that ros homeostasis can be affected by the ros produced at both the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and mitochondria in arabidopsis . is a synthetic promoter that contains an auxin response element whose _PROTEIN_ provides reliable information concerning auxin distribution in roots and other tissues . we introduced gus _PROTEIN_ into the _PROTEIN_ mutant . gus staining in the cotyledon was less in _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type . in the primary root tips gus staining was faint in _PROTEIN_ but strong in the wild type . aba treatment reduced gus _PROTEIN_ in both primary root tips and leaves of the wild type and also in leaves of _PROTEIN_ . the addition of napthalene acetic acid to the medium induced the _PROTEIN_ of gus to higher levels in both _PROTEIN_ and the wild type indicating that the auxin signaling pathway is not defective in _PROTEIN_ . however gus _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ was still lower than that in the wild type upon naa treatment suggesting that ros are negative regulators of auxin response . _PROTEIN_ is another auxin marker whose _PROTEIN_ is rapidly induced by auxin . we introduced indole acetic acid gus into the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the _PROTEIN_ of gus in primary root tips was lower in _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type . aba treatment reduced gus _PROTEIN_ in both _PROTEIN_ and the wild type . as a previous study indicates that a low concentration of aba likely increases gus _PROTEIN_ we performed similar experiments to test the effect of aba treatment on gus _PROTEIN_ . as shown in figure gus staining was greatly reduced by aba treatment when staining was performed for a short time . when samples were stained for a longer period the strength of gus staining was hard to compare suggesting that the conditions used by our lab and by citation might have differed . these results suggest that auxin accumulation or responsiveness is less in _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type . previous studies indicate that ros degrade or oxidize auxin and that ros are negative regulators of the auxin response . the high accumulation of ros in _PROTEIN_ may perturb auxin homeostasis and thereby affect root growth . we tested whether the exogenous addition of auxins could restore the aba sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ . the two auxins used were naa which is able to cross the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ without the help of auxin facilitators and d which requires auxin facilitators to cross the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . wild type seeds germinated earlier in the presence of nm d or nm naa than in the absence of d or naa and the addition of nm d or nm naa could release the aba mediated inhibition of seed germination of the wild type indicating that auxin is able to promote seed germination of wild type arabidopsis . an increase from to nm naa or d to the medium restored the aba mediated inhibition of seed germination greening of _PROTEIN_ . similarly the addition of low concentrations of naa or d to the medium also released the inhibition of primary root growth by aba in _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ of auxin transport proteins is regulated by auxin homeostasis . the reduced auxin response in _PROTEIN_ may be due to perturbed _PROTEIN_ auxin transport reduced auxin levels or both . we compared the _PROTEIN_ of auxin transport proteins using _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or auxin _PROTEIN_ promoter derived _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ and the wild type . as shown in figures and the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ level was lower in _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type . aba treatment reduced _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in both _PROTEIN_ and the wild type but the relative level of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was reduced more in _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type . similar differences were observed between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ roots of _PROTEIN_ and the wild type . the addition of gsh to the medium increased the relative levels of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ more in _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type . the addition of bso to the medium consistently _PROTEIN_ the relative amount of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in both _PROTEIN_ and the wild type . the addition of gsh recovered the relative amount of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in both aba treated _PROTEIN_ and aba treated wild type plants . however a combination of aba and bso substantially _PROTEIN_ the amount of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ so that the _METHOD_ signals were hardly detectably . these results suggest that ros production in _PROTEIN_ contributes to the _PROTEIN_ abundance of auxin transport proteins which would _PROTEIN_ the auxin transport capacities and auxin levels .
arabidopsis thaliana ecotype columbia seeds were germinated and grown on _METHOD_ medium with suc and agar in glass plates in a light homoeothermic incubator with h h dark . for the root bending assay d old seedlings were moved to _METHOD_ medium containing aba gsh bso or other chemicals as indicated . for germination seeds were placed on _METHOD_ medium containing different concentrations of aba nacl mannitol gsh and other reagents with three plates for each treatment . the seedlings were grown in forest soil and vermiculite under light at and h h dark in a greenhouse . the ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenized seeds of were used for screening aba sensitive mutants by the root bending assay because growth of did not differ on _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ supplemented with aba . seedlings were transferred onto _METHOD_ agar medium supplemented with aba and grown with the roots pointing upward for an additional d putative mutants with inhibited root growth were selected . the root growth phenotypes of putative mutant seedlings were rechecked in the second and third generations . approximately ethyl methanesulfonate mutated seedlings were screened and one _PROTEIN_ mutant allele was obtained . plants grown under short day conditions were used in these analyses . for drought treatment d old mutant and wild type seedlings were transferred to small pots grown for weeks under normal conditions and then subjected to drought treatment by withholding watering for d. for water loss treatment of detached leaves shoots of week old mutant and wild type plants were cut with a pair of scissors placed on a piece of weighing paper and kept at and humidity in the light . the shoots were weighed immediately after they were cut and periodically thereafter . the percentage of water loss was calculated on the basis of the initial weight of the plants with three replicate shoots for each assay . for stomatal aperture assays epidermal strips from rosette leaves of week old seedlings were examined with a light microscope . stomatal apertures were measured with motic software for three replicates with three epidermal strips per replicate and stomata per strip . for pro and sugar analysis the shoots of week old seedlings were detached and kept on the greenhouse bench for h. they were then ground in liquid nitrogen before pro and _PROTEIN_ contents were determined according to citation . _PROTEIN_ was crossed to ler accession and mutant plants were selected from the population based on the aba sensitive phenotype on _METHOD_ medium supplemented with aba . simple sequence length polymorphism markers were used to map _PROTEIN_ first to chromosome between the bac clones and . markers in _PROTEIN_ and were then used to narrow the location of the _PROTEIN_ mutation to a region between the bac clone and _PROTEIN_ . all candidate genes in this region were sequenced and a g a point mutation was found in _PROTEIN_ . for complementation of the _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ cdna was amplified from reverse transcribed cdna with the primer pair ctgcagatgcgtttcacaaaaagaataagcctcttc and ggtaccttacttgcccttggatcgcctgc . the pcr products were cloned in the t easy vector . the dna fragments were then cloned in the psti and kpni sites of a modified vector under the control of a super promoter . the cloned construct was transformed into agrobacterium tumefaciens cells and transferred into plants using the floral dip method . transgenic homozygous lines in the generation were used for complementation . a salk t dna insertion line obtained from the arabidopsis information resource was lethal in the homozygous state . _PROTEIN_ was crossed with the heterozygous t dna lines to obtain the seedlings and their sensitivity to aba was examined . the genomic dna fragments isolated from aba sensitive lines were examined by pcr analysis and all lines were determined to be heterozygous mutants that contained both _PROTEIN_ and the t dna insertion . the primers used for amplification of t dna insertion were as follows lp _PROTEIN_ rp ggtggtctcttttgcttttcc tf _PROTEIN_ . the primers used for amplification of _PROTEIN_ mutation were as follows _PROTEIN_ dcaps f tagagcgggatatcttcgcaatgc _PROTEIN_ dcaps r _PROTEIN_ . the pcr products amplified from the wild type were cut with saci whereas those amplified from _PROTEIN_ were not . _PROTEIN_ was also crossed with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the double mutants were identified . full length _PROTEIN_ cdna was obtained by pcr from the t easy vector containing _PROTEIN_ cdna with the primers ctgcagatgcgtttcacaaaaagaataagcctcttc and ggtacccttgcccttggatcgcctgc . the pcr products were cloned into the _PROTEIN_ t vector the dna fragments were then subcloned into the psti and kpni sites of a modified vector that contains _METHOD_ cdna between the kpni and saci sites . the cloned construct was transformed into agrobacterium cells and transferred into plants using the floral dip method . because _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was not observed in the transgenic plants the n terminal part of _PROTEIN_ that contains the mitochondrial signal peptide was used in place of full length _PROTEIN_ cdna using the primers ctgcagatgcgtttcacaaaaagaataagcctcttc and ggtaccatctggacgccgtggaagaag in _METHOD_ . after sequence analysis correct vectors were transformed into isolated arabidopsis protoplasts which were stained with the mito tracker and examined with a zeiss lsm meta confocal microscope . for confocal microscopy green _METHOD_ images were obtained with an excitation at nm and emission at nm and red images were obtained with an excitation at nm and emission at nm . was detected in situ by dab staining . the terminal leaflet of the first fully expanded leaf was sampled from d old wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants treated with aba or drought for h. leaflets were collected and vacuum infiltrated with dab solution . the sampled leaflets were placed in a plastic box in a light homoeothermic incubator until a reddish brown precipitate was observed they were then fixed in a solution of ethanol lactic acid glycerol and photographed . in the roots was stained with mg/ml dab in mm tris buffer ph with subsequent steps being the same as those described for leaflets . the _PROTEIN_ da staining assay was performed as described previously . briefly d old seedlings were treated with or aba for h incubated in _PROTEIN_ da in mm k phosphate ph in darkness for min and washed three times with the same buffer . _METHOD_ was detected with a confocal microscope with an excitation at nm and emission at nm and collected by scanning different slices the bottom to the top of a sample . the slices were overlaid using the projection function of zeiss lsm image brower software and the _METHOD_ intensities were collected using axiovision rel . software which was displayed as estimated mean pixel intensities . approximately images were acquired per sample and three independent experiments were performed . we used nbt staining to detect in situ as described previously with the following modifications . four day old seedlings were treated with or aba for h incubated in mm nbt in mm k phosphate with m nacl at ph for min and then transferred to distilled water . root tips were imaged under bright field illumination on a zeiss scope ai microscope and all of the images in an experiment were taken with the same settings . approximately images were taken each time and three independent experiments were performed . four day old seedlings were transferred to _METHOD_ medium containing aba and mm bso and grown for another d. then root tips were collected for quantitative measurement of gsh . the gsh content was measured using a glutathione colorimetric detection kit with the following minor modifications . the root tips were ground to powder using liquid nitrogen mg of each sample was then dissolved in gsh buffer and sulfosalicylic acid was added and mixed gently . the samples were incubated on ice for min and centrifuged at at for min and the supernatants were collected for gsh detection . for determination of gsh content the samples or gsh standards were mixed with of reaction solution on a microtiter plate and incubated at room temperature for min . then of substrate was added to each sample and the absorbencies at nm were recorded for and min . the gsh content was calculated according to the standard curve . two week old seedlings were submerged into aba for h. total rnas were extracted and hybridized with different probes as described previously . the primers used to amplify the probes for rna gel blot analysis are listed in supplemental table online . for real time qrt pcr of total rnas was digested with rnase free dnase i . the digested rna was then reverse transcribed into cdna using oligo primers and moloney murine leukemia virus transcriptase in a reaction . the cdnas were used as templates in real time pcr reactions using sybr premix ex tag with gene specific primers and the internal control . the primers used for qrt pcr are listed in supplemental table online the primers were used to amplify _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are listed in supplemental table online . pcr was performed using a _PROTEIN_ dna engine cycle with a detector in reactions and the following amplification procedure min at s at s at to s at and min at . next a standard dissociation protocol was used to examine whether the amplifications were specific . triple biological replications were performed for each of three independent samples and the values shown represent the average of three assays for each real time pcr sample . the results are given as a ratio of the values in the wild type . for the analysis of nad splicing the primers were designed to amplify two different fragments . one pair of primers was used to amplify the fragment that spans two adjacent exons another pair of primers was used to amplify the intron exon fragment . these primers are listed in supplemental table online . if amplification of the intron exon fragment in _PROTEIN_ was greater than that in the wild type it means that the splicing was impaired in _PROTEIN_ . arabidopsis plants harboring gus gus _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and mito _METHOD_ were crossed with _PROTEIN_ . homozygous plants for the mutant and marker lines were separated from the and population before they were subjected to gus staining or _METHOD_ . four day old seedlings were transferred to _METHOD_ containing aba gsh or mm bso and grown for another d. for gus staining seedlings were incubated in m phosphate buffer and mg/ml x _PROTEIN_ at for different times and were then incubated in ethanol for several hours to remove chlorophylls . staining time was min for gus and h for gus . seedlings were photographed with an olympus _METHOD_ microscope and a zeiss scope ai microscope . for _METHOD_ _METHOD_ the roots of the plants treated with different reagents were observed with a zeiss lsm meta confocal microscope and photographed under the same settings . the _METHOD_ images were collected by scanning different slices from one side to the other side and the images were overlaid using the projection function of zeiss lsm image browser software . _METHOD_ intensities were collected using axiovision rel . software which was displayed as estimated mean pixel intensities . approximately images were taken per sample and three independent experiments were performed . sequence data from this article can be
