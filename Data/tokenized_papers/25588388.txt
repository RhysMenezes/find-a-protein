stomatal movements are regulated by multiple environmental signals . recent investigations indicate that photoperiodic flowering components such as cry _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ in guard cells and positively affect stomatal opening in arabidopsis thaliana . here we show that _PROTEIN_ which encodes a mads box transcription _PROTEIN_ and integrates multiple flowering signals also exerts a positive effect on stomatal opening . _PROTEIN_ encodes a potent repressor of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ acts as an activator of _PROTEIN_ . thus we examined stomatal phenotypes in _PROTEIN_ col which contains an active _PROTEIN_ allele of accession sf by introgression . we found higher _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and lower _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in guard cells from _PROTEIN_ col than in those from col. light induced stomatal opening was significantly suppressed in _PROTEIN_ col. interestingly vernalization of _PROTEIN_ col partially restored light induced stomatal opening concomitant with a _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and increase of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . furthermore we observed the constitutive open stomata phenotype in transgenic plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in guard cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and found that light induced stomatal opening was significantly suppressed in a _PROTEIN_ knockout mutant . rna sequencing using epidermis from the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overexpressor revealed that the _PROTEIN_ levels of several genes involved in stomatal opening such as and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ h _PROTEIN_ were higher than those in background plants . from these results we conclude that _PROTEIN_ is involved in the regulation of stomatal opening via transcriptional regulation in guard cells .
_PROTEIN_ elevates _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ which represses flowering . plants with an active _PROTEIN_ allele showed reduced _PROTEIN_ of the major flowering components such as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ without vernalization or _PROTEIN_ flowering phenotype . in addition it has been reported that _PROTEIN_ affects stomatal opening positively in a. thaliana . these results suggest that if _PROTEIN_ also elevates the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ and reduces the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ via _PROTEIN_ in stomatal guard cells the plants with an active _PROTEIN_ allele would show a closed stomata phenotype . therefore we examined _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in col and _PROTEIN_ col gcps by reverse transcription pcr . we observed higher _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ col . in contrast _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in gcps of _PROTEIN_ col were lower than those of col . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ affects the _PROTEIN_ of these components in guard cells as well as leaves and suggest that light induced stomatal opening would be reduced in _PROTEIN_ col since positive regulators of stomatal opening _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were reduced in gcps of _PROTEIN_ col. next we investigated light induced stomatal opening in col and _PROTEIN_ col . as expected light induced stomatal opening was significantly suppressed in _PROTEIN_ col . however the stomata in these mutants opened in response to the fungal toxin fusicoccin which induces stomatal opening via irreversible activation of h _PROTEIN_ . moreover _PROTEIN_ col showed similar stomatal density and index compared with those in col . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ col exhibits reduced light induced stomatal opening without affecting stomatal morphology and development and that the h _PROTEIN_ and its immediate regulatory _METHOD_ are not affected in _PROTEIN_ col. enhancement of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ is canceled by vernalization in leaves . therefore we carried out vernalization of col and _PROTEIN_ col and then examined the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the epidermis including guard cells . vernalization reduced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and increased _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . next we examined light induced stomatal opening . in col plants vernalization had no effect on stomatal phenotype . interestingly light induced stomatal opening was significantly enhanced in vernalized _PROTEIN_ col . these results suggest that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in guard cells are correlated with stomatal aperture . note that _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in vernalized _PROTEIN_ col were lower than those in vernalized col . consistent with this the stomatal aperture under light condition in vernalized _PROTEIN_ col was smaller than that in vernalized col . these results indicate that vernalization is not sufficient for reduction of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ col . in _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ col was reduced only by vernalization . further investigation will be needed to examine the effects of vernalization period on the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and light induced stomatal aperture in _PROTEIN_ col. figs . and indicate a correlation between _PROTEIN_ levels and stomatal opening in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . however there is no experimental evidence to show regulation of stomatal movement by _PROTEIN_ . therefore we generated _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ transgenic plants with the _PROTEIN_ promoter a strong guard cell promoter to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ specifically in guard cells . we used a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant as the background plant . since the light induced stomatal opening in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is very small it is easy to monitor the effect of a transgene on stomatal aperture . as shown in fig . the _PROTEIN_ level of epidermal _PROTEIN_ including the endogenous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants was to fold higher than the endogenous _PROTEIN_ of the background plants . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals were observed _PROTEIN_ from _LOCATION_ stained by the _LOCATION_ marker diamidino phenylindole and secondarily from the _LOCATION_ in guard cells . we then analyzed the stomatal responses of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overexpressing plants . the stomata of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants did not show light induced stomatal opening as this mutant lacked functional phototropins . interestingly the stomata of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overexpressing plants opened widely in both dark and light conditions as seen in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants . to examine how _PROTEIN_ overexpression induces stomatal opening we tested the effects of aba and the type protein phosphatase inhibitor calyculin a which inhibit blue light dependent activation of h _PROTEIN_ in guard cells on stomatal aperture and found that aba and ca induced stomatal closure in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overexpressing plants . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ may affect stomatal aperture at least in part by affecting the h _PROTEIN_ activity in guard cells . next we examined stomatal phenotypes in a t dna insertional mutant of _PROTEIN_ . as shown in fig . there was no detectable _PROTEIN_ transcript indicating that this mutant is a knockout mutant of _PROTEIN_ . therefore we designated it as _PROTEIN_ . light induced stomatal opening was significantly suppressed in the _PROTEIN_ mutant and in the loss of function mutant of _PROTEIN_ ft . however the stomata of these mutants opened in response to an activator of h _PROTEIN_ fc . moreover the _PROTEIN_ mutant showed similar stomatal density and index compared with col . these results suggest that the _PROTEIN_ mutant shows reduced light induced stomatal opening without affecting morphology and stomatal development and that the h _PROTEIN_ and its immediate regulatory _METHOD_ are not affected in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . _PROTEIN_ encodes the mads domain transcription _PROTEIN_ and microarray and chromatin immunoprecipitation _PROTEIN_ seq analyses show that _PROTEIN_ regulates gene _PROTEIN_ in seedlings . additionally _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ primarily in the _LOCATION_ of guard cells . together these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ in guard cells also affects gene _PROTEIN_ . to identify the genes controlled by _PROTEIN_ in guard cells we performed rna sequencing experiments using rnas from the epidermis including guard cells of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants . we found that read numbers of numerous genes are increased in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overexpressing plants . supplementary table lists the top genes in which the read numbers are increased in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overexpressing plants based on fold change . however to our knowledge no gene has been conclusively implicated in stomatal opening and closing . therefore we focused on the genes involved in blue light induced stomatal opening such as a primary component mediating phototropin signaling catalytic subunits of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a positive signaling component between phototropins and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ h _PROTEIN_ regulatory subunits of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a positive signaling component with topps _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ h _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which induce hyperpolarization of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ for k uptake and inward rectifying k channels _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which take up k in response to hyperpolarization . interestingly the read numbers of some h _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were higher in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overexpressing plants . furthermore we confirmed an increase in the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ including the endogenous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ as a direct downstream component of phototropins and _PROTEIN_ as a typical guard cell h _PROTEIN_ isoform in arabidopsis in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overexpressing plants by rt pcr . in contrast the read numbers of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were lower in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overexpressing plants . the read numbers of topp genes and _PROTEIN_ were similar between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overexpressing and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants . these results indicate that actually _PROTEIN_ regulates gene _PROTEIN_ in stomatal guard cells including the genes involved in blue light induced stomatal opening .

leaves were isolated as described above . isolated epidermal fragments were incubated in phosphate buffered saline containing dapi for min at . after incubation epidermal fragments were collected on
