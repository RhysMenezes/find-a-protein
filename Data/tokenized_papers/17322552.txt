tail anchored proteins are bound to _LOCATION_ by a hydrophobic sequence located very close to the c terminus followed by a short luminal _PROTEIN_ region . their active domains are exposed to the _LOCATION_ . ta proteins are synthesized on free _LOCATION_ ribosomes and are found on the surface of every subcellular compartment where they play various roles . the basic _METHOD_ of sorting and targeting of ta proteins to the correct _LOCATION_ are poorly characterized . in mammalian cells the net charge of the luminal region determines the sorting to the correct target _LOCATION_ a positive charge leading to mitochondria and negative or null charge to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . here sorting signals of ta proteins were studied in plant cells and compared with those of mammalian proteins using in vitro translation translocation and in vivo _PROTEIN_ in tobacco protoplasts or leaves . it is shown that rabbit cytochrome with a negative charge is faithfully sorted to the plant _LOCATION_ whereas a change to a positive charge leads to chloroplast targeting . the subcellular location of two cyt _METHOD_ from arabidopsis thaliana was then determined . _GENE_ is targeted to the _LOCATION_ and _GENE_ to the chloroplast envelope . the results show that the plant _LOCATION_ unlike the mammalian _LOCATION_ can accommodate cytochromes with opposite c terminal net charge and plant cells have a specific and as yet uncharacterized mechanism to sort ta proteins with the same positive c terminal charge to different _LOCATION_ .
comparison of the c terminal _PROTEIN_ sequences of cyt from plants and mammals showed that a net negative charge is present in the mammalian _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ only . the known cyt sequences of plants have c termini with positive or neutral charge . it is therefore possible that plants and mammals use different _METHOD_ to sort and target cyt . to address this question it was first determined whether two mammalian _METHOD_ of cyt resident either in the _LOCATION_ or in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ their correct intracellular locations once _PROTEIN_ in plant cells . the difference between the two _METHOD_ is in the net charge of the c terminal _PROTEIN_ region only with the substitution of the c terminal negative _PROTEIN_ region of _LOCATION_ with two arginines . to detect the proteins by _METHOD_ and biochemical techniques tagged versions of these sequences termed nglyc and rrnglyc were used in which an epitope containing an n glycosylation consensus sequence recognized by a specific anti opsin mab was appended at the c terminus . the two proteins were distributed either in the _LOCATION_ or in the _PROTEIN_ when _PROTEIN_ in mammalian cells . in an in vitro translation translocation system both _METHOD_ were instead post translationally translocated into dog _PROTEIN_ microsomes indicating that the _PROTEIN_ isoform can be inserted into the _LOCATION_ as well and that unknown additional _PROTEIN_ present in intact cells are required for correct targeting to the _PROTEIN_ . we first investigated whether the two proteins are also able to translocate their c termini across plant microsomes in vitro . mrnas coding for either nglyc or rrnglyc were translated in the reticulocyte lysate system in the presence of methionine . after stopping translation equal amounts of the labelled translation products were incubated either in the absence or in the presence of microsomes purified from p. vulgaris developing cotyledons for h at . after incubation samples were analysed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and autoradiography . n glycosylation affects migration of the protein in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ leading to a higher apparent molecular _METHOD_ and this was used to assess the occurrence and efficiency of translocation . figure shows that both proteins are post translationally glycosylated by plant microsomes the shift of rrnglyc and nglyc to a higher molecular _METHOD_ form indicates the occurrence of glycosylation . after h in the presence of microsomes the glycosylated molecules represented of nglyc but only of rrnglyc indicating that rrnglyc was glycosylated with lower efficiency than nglyc . this is in contrast to the results obtained by citation in that study using dog _PROTEIN_ microsomes rrnglyc was more efficiently glycosylated than nglyc . this could reflect some difference in the make up of plant and mammalian microsomes . having established that nglyc and rrnglyc can be targeted to plant microsomal _LOCATION_ in vitro the destiny of the two proteins in living plant cells was investigated . plasmids encoding nglyc and rrnglyc under the control of the camv constitutive promoter were transfected into tobacco mesophyll protoplasts . equal amounts of total protoplast homogenates were then subjected to endo h digestion before immunoblotting with anti opsin antibodies . as shown in fig . lane two polypeptides with apparent molecular _METHOD_ of kda and kda were detected when nglyc was _PROTEIN_ . the kda polypeptide was entirely sensitive to digestion with endo h and the change in mobility indicated that it represented the glycosylated form of the kda polypeptide . therefore the c terminal _PROTEIN_ sequence of nglyc is efficently translocated and glycosylated in vivo . conversely only a very minor proportion of rrnglyc was glycosylated . the results shown in fig . suggest that nglyc but not rrnglyc is efficiently targeted to the plant _LOCATION_ in vivo . to determine the subcellular localization of the two proteins protoplasts were analysed by _METHOD_ and confocal microscopy using anti mab alone or in combination with anti bip polyclonal antiserum . as shown in fig . nglyc showed a typical _LOCATION_ staining which is located in the interspace between chloroplasts with the _LOCATION_ envelope clearly stained as well . moreover upon double staining with anti and anti bip the pattern of _METHOD_ of nglyc was completely superimposed on that of the _LOCATION_ marker bip . by contrast rrnglyc showed a distribution which was superimposed to the envelope of chloroplasts . thus we conclude that the substitution of the c terminal residues of _LOCATION_ with a pair of basic residues is sufficient to relocate the protein from the _LOCATION_ to another _LOCATION_ in plants as well as in mammalian cells even if the target _LOCATION_ is not the _PROTEIN_ but the chloroplast envelope . moreover notwithstanding that to date plant cyt with a negative c terminus have not been identified nglyc is targeted to the _LOCATION_ in plant cells . an in depth search of the native arabidopsis cyt sequences was therefore performed to identify _METHOD_ with negatively charged luminal tails . within the a. thaliana proteome five sequences were identified and are listed and aligned in fig . . the primary structures of these polypeptides are very similar and have the canonical haem binding site in the first half of the molecule they have a hydrophobic putative _LOCATION_ spanning domain very close to the c terminus indicating a predicted ta topology . three of the identified proteins have a single positive net charge in the short c terminal _PROTEIN_ sequence whereas _GENE_ and _GENE_ have a double positive charge . no sequences with negatively charged c terminal luminal tails could be identified . three _METHOD_ _GENE_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ have more similarity to the identified _LOCATION_ isoform _GENE_ . the putative cyt coded by the _GENE_ gene has a number of differences with respect to the other four _METHOD_ its hydrophobic domain is longer and has a distinct amino acid composition . this determines a lower average hydrophobicity and lower maximal amphiphilicity of the helix _PROTEIN_ . this also results in a different hydrophobicity profile of the tail anchor of _GENE_ with respect to the other members . moreover the c terminal _PROTEIN_ region of _GENE_ has a net charge of whereas that of _GENE_ has . based on these differences it was decided to compare in detail the intracellular fate of _GENE_ and _GENE_ . the polypeptides coded by the _GENE_ and _GENE_ genes are referred to as and respectively . it was first tested if and polypeptides were able to translocate their c termini across plant _LOCATION_ microsomes in vitro . to do this the epitope was fused to the c termini of both the arabidopsis cyt sequences to detect glycosylation . the two tagged polypeptides were called nglyc and nglyc . the mrnas coding for either nglyc or nglyc were translated in the reticulocyte lysate system and after stopping translation equal amounts of labelled translation products were incubated in either the absence or presence of p. vulgaris microsomes for h at . after incubation samples were analysed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and autoradiography . figure shows that both proteins can be post translationally glycosylated by plant microsomes the shift of nglyc and nglyc to a higher molecular _METHOD_ form indicated the occurrence of glycosylation . both proteins seemed to be glycosylated with the same efficiency . it is concluded that both proteins were able to translocate their c termini post translationally across plant microsomes in vitro . to investigate the intracellular destiny of and _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ were fused to their n termini . the fusion constructs named _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were subcloned into the vector pdha for transient _PROTEIN_ in tobacco protoplasts or into the vector pgreenii for transient transfection of tobacco leaves mediated by agroinfiltration . the _PROTEIN_ levels and stability of the fusion proteins were first determined by pulse chase analysis . protoplasts from tobacco leaves were transiently transfected with pdha _METHOD_ or pdha _METHOD_ and labelled with methioine/cysteine for h followed by h of chase . at h or h of chase cells were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti _METHOD_ antibodies . the two fusion proteins have the expected molecular _METHOD_ and do not undergo degradation . very similar results were obtained when the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ constructs were _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ constructs were therefore used depending on which was more convenient . the intracellular localization of _METHOD_ was determined by confocal microscopy . tobacco leaves were infiltrated with a mixture of agrobacterium strains transformed with pgreen _METHOD_ and pbin _METHOD_ hdel . the latter is a modified _METHOD_ containing the hdel sequence for retrieval into the _LOCATION_ commonly used as a marker for this compartment . samples were analysed d after infiltration . _METHOD_ co localized with _METHOD_ hdel indicating that it is an _LOCATION_ resident . a similar co infiltration experiment was performed using a mixture of agrobacterium strains transformed with pgreen _METHOD_ _GENE_ or pbin _METHOD_ hdel . while _METHOD_ hdel showed the typical reticular pattern _METHOD_ was instead located in close proximity to chloroplasts which could be identified by chlorophyll _METHOD_ . the merge between the _METHOD_ given by _METHOD_ hdel _METHOD_ and chloroplasts shows that _METHOD_ was distributed around the chloroplasts partially superimposed on these organelles and did not co localize with the _LOCATION_ marker . _METHOD_ was also present in tubular structures which interconnected chloroplasts . these structures termed stromules were previously observed in several plants as highly dynamic stroma filled tubules extending from the surface of all _LOCATION_ types examined so far including proplastids chloroplasts etioplasts leucoplasts amyloplasts and chromoplasts . the results shown in fig . suggest that _METHOD_ may be located on the _PROTEIN_ . we therefore subcloned an _PROTEIN_ cassette encoding the _PROTEIN_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ into pgreen ii and infiltrated tobacco leaves with a mixture of agrobacterium strains transformed with pgreen _METHOD_ or pgreen _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . three days after infiltration it was observed that the pattern of distribution of _METHOD_ was completely superimposed on that of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and that both proteins were located on the surface of chloroplasts . the two proteins were also located on stromules which were not detectable by chloroplast intrinsic _METHOD_ . from these results it was concluded that _METHOD_ is anchored to the _PROTEIN_ . to determine whether a proportion of _METHOD_ was also present on mitochondria the marker mit _METHOD_ a _METHOD_ targeted to the mitochondria by the signal sequence of the _PROTEIN_ subunit was used . tobacco leaves were infliltrated with a mixture of agrobacterium strains transformed with pgreen _METHOD_ _GENE_ or pgreen mit _METHOD_ . the _PROTEIN_ level of _METHOD_ was higher than that of mit _METHOD_ to obtain similar _METHOD_ levels leaves were therefore infiltrated with an unequal mixture of the two agrobacterium strains . two different patterns of _METHOD_ were observed which were related to the presence or absence of chloroplasts in cells in which chloroplasts were detectable _METHOD_ never co localized with mitochondria and was always associated with chloroplasts . by contrast when chloroplasts were not detectable _METHOD_ co localized with mitochondria . this unexpected result indicates that _METHOD_ has the capacity to localize promiscuously to both chloroplasts and mitochondria with a preference for the former . to determine whether the different localizations of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ could also be detected by subcellular fractionation tobacco protoplasts were transiently transfected with plasmids _PROTEIN_ either of the two _METHOD_ fusions . all batches of protoplasts were also co transfected with plasmid _PROTEIN_ the marker of the chloroplast envelope _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . at h after transfection protoplasts were homogenized in sorbitol buffer in the absence of detergents to _PROTEIN_ the integrity of the organelles . the homogenates were then fractionated by differential centrifugation two fractions were isolated containing respectively particles sedimenting at g and g and a third fraction containing the g supernatant . an equal amount of total protein from each fraction was analysed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and protein blot using antibodies against _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and the _LOCATION_ marker bip . as shown in fig . bip and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were enriched in the and fractions respectively . _METHOD_ was highly enriched in the fraction whereas _METHOD_ was present in both and fractions with a slight enrichment in the former . these results are largely consistent with the localizations indicated by _METHOD_ the presence of a minor but relevant proportion of _METHOD_ in the fraction could reflect enrichment of stromules in the g pellet with respect to the g pellet . alternatively this proportion of _METHOD_ could be localized on the mitochondria which often contaminate the g microsomal fraction . these results were also confirmed by the _PROTEIN_ of the two tagged form nglyc and nglyc in living tobacco protoplasts while the first was totally glycosylated the second never acquired the glycan .
dna manipulations were carried out by standard techniques . the absence of _LOCATION_ in fragments generated by polymerase chain reaction or in synthetic oligonucleotide cassettes was verified by sequencing . the rabbit cyt _METHOD_ nglyc and rrnglyc were derived from the plasmid described in citation . to _PROTEIN_ this cdna as well as the other constructs transiently in plant cells the insert was placed under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter by subcloning it into pdha vector . the coding sequences of nglyc and rrnglyc were excised from the vector by digestion with bglii and bamhi and subcloned into pdha linearized with bamhi . the resulting constructs are termed pdha nglyc and pdha rrnglyc and are used for tobacco leaf protoplast transformation . to identify the a. thaliana cyt polypeptides the mammalian _LOCATION_ cyt amino acid sequence was blasted against the entire arabidopsis proteome of the tair site using the blastp function . five putative cyt were found and their cdna coding sequences were determined . in this work two of these cdnas were used _GENE_ and _GENE_ and their cdna sequences were kindly provided by tair cdna stock order service . the _GENE_ and _GENE_ cdnas were provided inserted into the his topo vector and the vector respectively . to subclone these sequences into the _PROTEIN_ pdha vector _GENE_ and _GENE_

reverse primer acatgcatgcgagctcctcgagtcaagaagaaggagccttggt . the pcr products were digested with xbai and sphi and subcloned into pdha digested with xbai and sphi . the resulting constructs were termed pdha and pdha . to fuse the n terminus of arabidopsis cyt sequences in frame with the _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ coding sequence _METHOD_ _METHOD_ a three way ligation was performed between _GENE_ or _GENE_ digested with bamhi/sphi _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ cdna digested with xbai/bamhi and pdha digested with xbai/sphi . the resulting constructs were termed pdha _METHOD_ pdha _METHOD_ pdha _METHOD_ and pdha _METHOD_ . the ecori fragment excised from the pdha _METHOD_ or pdha _METHOD_ construct which contain the camv promoter the coding sequence for cyt _METHOD_ and the terminator was subcloned into ecori linearized which has the hygromycin resistance gene . these constructs called pgreen _METHOD_ and pgreen _METHOD_ were used to transform agrobacterium tumefaciens strain by the freeze thaw method . a hindiii ecori fragment containing the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ marker _PROTEIN_ cassette was cloned into the same sites of for agroinfiltration . this and all other constructs used for agroinfiltration were also transformed into a. tumefaciens . to tag the end of _GENE_ and _GENE_ with the sequence agei/xhoi restriction sites were introduced and the stop codon was first eliminated by pcr amplification using the following reverse primers and turbo pfu polymerase reverse primer _PROTEIN_ reverse primer _PROTEIN_ . the blunt pcr products were subcloned into the ecorv site of pbluescript _PROTEIN_ . the resulting constructs were termed pbs and pbs . pbs and pbs were digested with agei/xhoi and a synthetic sequence obtained by pairing the following two phosphorylated complementary oligonucleotides were introduced upper synthetic oligonucleotide ccggtatgaacggaacagaaggaccaaacttctacgtaccattcagcaacaaaacagtagactgac lower synthetic oligonucleotide

cv . petit havana _PROTEIN_ and subjected to polyethylene glycol mediated transfection as described by citation . a aliquot of recombinant pdha plasmids or pdha without inserts were used to transform
