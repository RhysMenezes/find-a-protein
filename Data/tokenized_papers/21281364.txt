copper is an essential micronutrient that functions as a redox cofactor in multiple plant processes including photosynthesis . arabidopsis thaliana possesses a conserved family of ctr like high affinity copper transport proteins denoted as _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ the only family member that is functionally characterized participates in plant copper acquisition . however little is known about the function of the other arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ proteins in the transport and distribution of copper . here we show that a functional fusion of _PROTEIN_ to the green _METHOD_ protein localizes in arabidopsis cells to the prevacuolar compartment . plants defective in _PROTEIN_ do not exhibit any significant phenotype under copper sufficient conditions but their growth is compromised under copper limitation . under extreme copper deficiency two independent _PROTEIN_ knockout mutant lines exhibit severe defects in vegetative growth and root elongation low chlorophyll content and impairment in the photosynthetic electron transfer . all these phenotypes are rescued when the wild type copy of the _PROTEIN_ gene is retransformed into a _PROTEIN_ knockout line or when copper but not other metals are added to the medium . _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in vascular tissues with elevated levels in roots . taken together these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ plays an important role in the plant response to environmental copper scarcity probably by remobilizing copper from prevacuolar vesicles which could act as internal stores or recycling vesicles to provide the metal cofactor to key copper dependent processes such as photosynthesis .
previous results have demonstrated that the heterologous _PROTEIN_ of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ gene in s. cerevisiae partially complements the respiratory and cu transport defect exhibited by a _PROTEIN_ mutant . to investigate the specific function of _PROTEIN_ in plants we isolated three independent arabidopsis t dna insertion lines . two mutant lines were obtained from the salk collection _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ whereas the third line was received from the nasc collection _PROTEIN_ . in each case the t dna insertion mutants were self pollinated and homozygous lines were isolated . the _PROTEIN_ line contained a t dna insertion located nucleotides upstream of the _PROTEIN_ open reading frame and was therefore ruled out for further analyses . on the other hand the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines exhibited a t dna insertion at the fourth and eighth nucleotide of _PROTEIN_ orf respectively . it is important to stress that the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene was completely abolished in both the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant lines . moreover a wild type allele of the _PROTEIN_ gene including nucleotides of its own promoter region was used to retransform the _PROTEIN_ mutant . homozygous _PROTEIN_ lines complemented with the exogenous _PROTEIN_ gene construct rescued the _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ . as compared with the wild type arabidopsis plants no significant difference was observed in the _PROTEIN_ mutant lines in _METHOD_ of growth or endogenous cu levels when grown in soil . however day old _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings showed slightly reduced root length when grown on a standard _METHOD_ medium . as the standard _METHOD_ agar medium is slightly deficient in cu as indicated by the activation in the _PROTEIN_ of the high affinity cu transporter _PROTEIN_ under these conditions we investigated root elongation in the _PROTEIN_ mutant lines grown on the _METHOD_ medium supplemented with additional cu . no difference was observed between the root length of the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ mutant lines when was added to the growth medium . these results suggest that the phenotype observed for the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants on the _METHOD_ medium is due to cu deficiency . to further ascertain this possibility we compared the root length of the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings grown on a standard _METHOD_ medium supplemented with increasing concentrations of bathocuproine disulphonic acid a specific cu chelator . as observed in figure the root length of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings diminished as the concentration of bcs in the growth medium gradually increased . on the _METHOD_ plates with bcs the root length of the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants _PROTEIN_ by if compared with the wild type plants . to further analyze the _PROTEIN_ root phenotype we treated both wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant lines with fluoroglucinol which stains lignified cell walls . although no differences were observed for cu sufficient conditions the roots of the _PROTEIN_ mutants displayed a significant increase in cell wall lignification when grown under cu deficient conditions . as the plants in these experiments were germinated and grown on cu deficient media as compared to cu sufficient conditions the phenotype observed for the _PROTEIN_ mutant lines could be attributed to defects during seed germination rather than to defects in root growth . to further assess whether the defect in root growth was specific both the wild type and the two _PROTEIN_ mutants were grown for days on a cu sufficient medium _METHOD_ . then seedlings were either transferred to cu deficient conditions _METHOD_ or kept under cu sufficient conditions for additional days . root length measurements revealed that both _PROTEIN_ mutant plants still show a short root phenotype when grown under cu deficiency . these results indicate that the _PROTEIN_ protein _METHOD_ an important function during root growth when cu availability is low . to further test the specific effect of cu scarcity on the root growth of _PROTEIN_ plants we examined whether the addition of different metal ions to the _METHOD_ medium supplemented with bcs could rescue the phenotype . indeed the addition of was sufficient to rescue _PROTEIN_ root growth although the same concentration of other metal ions including iron zinc manganese and cadmium did not restore _PROTEIN_ root growth when added to the bcs containing medium . besides copper only silver which is isoelectric to cu completely rescued the root growth defect of the _PROTEIN_ plants on the bcs plates . taken together these data strongly suggest that the root growth of the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants is highly and specifically sensitive to cu deficiency . in addition to the root phenotype described above a slight growth reduction was observed for the _PROTEIN_ mutants grown under low cu conditions _METHOD_ . thus we decided to analyze the exacerbated _PROTEIN_ associated phenotypes when plants are grown for prolonged periods under cu deprivation induced by the bcs cu chelator . as figure depicts the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant lines exhibit growth inhibition and chlorosis if compared with the wild type plants or the _PROTEIN_ knockout plant complemented with the _PROTEIN_ gene after growing for weeks under extreme cu deficient conditions _METHOD_ . these differences disappeared when plants were grown under cu sufficiency . to further quantify the differences found under cu deficient conditions we determined the fresh weight of all the lines grown under either cu sufficiency or cu limiting conditions . a three fold _PROTEIN_ in fresh weight was observed for the _PROTEIN_ mutant lines grown on the _METHOD_ medium containing bcs as compared with the wild type plants . the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants grown on the _METHOD_ medium containing show a slight growth defect which was completely abolished at higher cu concentrations . a partial recovery of fresh weight was observed for the _PROTEIN_ knockout mutant complemented with the _PROTEIN_ gene . furthermore the _PROTEIN_ mutants are chlorotic when grown for weeks under cu deficient conditions . to quantify this observation we determined the chlorophyll levels when plants were grown under either cu sufficient or cu deficient conditions . while no difference in chlorophyll content was observed on the _METHOD_ medium containing an approximate _PROTEIN_ in the chlorophyll levels was noted for the _PROTEIN_ mutants when grown in the presence of the bcs cu chelator . the levels of both chlorophyll a and b equally diminished in the _PROTEIN_ mutant grown under cu deficiency conditions . collectively these results indicate that the growth of _PROTEIN_ defective plants is inhibited under severe cu limitation suggesting an important and specific function of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ protein under cu deprivation . the measurement of chlorophyll _METHOD_ from intact leaves is not only a reliable and non intrusive method for monitoring the photosynthetic performance of plants but is also an excellent biosensor to evaluate the extent of plant tolerance to environmental stresses . to test whether the _PROTEIN_ mutants are affected in photosynthesis we determined multiple _METHOD_ based parameters associated with the photosynthetic electron transport chain function under both cu sufficient and cu deficient conditions . for these experiments we chose a light intensity _PROTEIN_ of which is optimal for wild type plants grown under cu deficient conditions _METHOD_ and low enough to avoid the photoinhibition of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . we firstly determined that the values of multiple _METHOD_ parameters of photosystem ii were similar for the wild type plants grown on either soil or cu sufficient _METHOD_ medium . given the difficulties in reducing cu availability on soil in a reproducible manner we performed these experiments on _METHOD_ medium . when the wild type _PROTEIN_ mutant and _PROTEIN_ complemented with the _PROTEIN_ gene seedlings were grown under cu sufficient conditions no significant differences were observed for the fv/fm and parameters . these results suggest that the _PROTEIN_ protein does not play a relevant role in the psii function under cu sufficient conditions . when cu availability was limited by adding bcs to the _METHOD_ medium arabidopsis wild type seedlings displayed a slight _PROTEIN_ in fv/fm _PROTEIN_ and a more notable reduction in _PROTEIN_ . furthermore under these cu deficient conditions the non photochemical energy in psii was mostly lost by a non regulated mechanism . these results indicate that arabidopsis plants display defects in the photosynthetic electron chain including a low photochemical activity when cu availability is extremely low . it is important to note that under cu deficient conditions fv/fm _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were drastically reduced in the _PROTEIN_ mutants but not in the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ complemented lines when they were grown under cu deficient conditions . no differences between the lines were observed for and . taken together these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ is crucial for the efficiency of psii photochemistry and therefore for the transfer of electrons through psii when cu availability is extremely limited . to further address the defects observed in the photosynthetic electron transport chain we determined the redox state of the quinone acceptor qa of psii . as shown in figure qa exists _PROTEIN_ in its oxidized state for the wild type _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ complemented plants under cu sufficient conditions . under cu deficient conditions the qa in the _PROTEIN_ mutants lowered more than in either the wild type or the _PROTEIN_ complemented plants which is consistent with a defect in the electron transport chain after psii in the _PROTEIN_ mutant lines under cu limitation . collectively these data strongly suggest that the _PROTEIN_ cu transport protein is important for photosynthetic electron transfer when plants are grown under extreme cu deficient conditions . furthermore they are also consistent with a defect in the cu delivery to the cu dependent plastocyanin electron transporter which is situated after psii . growth assays performed in s. cerevisiae have shown that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ fully complements the respiratory defect displayed by a _PROTEIN_ yeast mutant growing on non fermentable _PROTEIN_ sources whereas _PROTEIN_ only partially rescues this phenotype . a potential explanation for these results could be the different subcellular localization for both proteins . while the _PROTEIN_ protein was recently localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of arabidopsis cells the localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein has not yet been determined . a recent proteomic approach has identified _PROTEIN_ as a tonoplast protein in cultured arabidopsis cells . members of the ctr family of high affinity cu transporters have been previously localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of s. cerevisiae and s. pombe . however no plant ctr type protein has been previously localized in an internal compartment . in order to monitor the _PROTEIN_ protein its coding sequence was tagged at its _PROTEIN_ terminus with the human influenza virus hemagglutinin ha epitope . the _PROTEIN_ ha sequence was cloned under the control of the constitutive promoter and introduced by agrobacterium transformation into the wild type col arabidopsis plants . these plants were grown in soil for weeks and the total protein extracts from leaves were subjected to a sucrose density gradient centrifugation . the different protein fractions were collected and analyzed by western blot with antibodies against multiple organelle markers including the h _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ plastocyanin the gamma subunit of _PROTEIN_ vesicles _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ the syntaxin _PROTEIN_ and the _LOCATION_ pyrophosphatase v hppase . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ displays a distribution pattern clearly different from the chloroplast marker pc which is recovered from low density fractions . however the slight differences observed between the rest of the markers are not sufficient to unequivocally establish _PROTEIN_ subcellular localization . to further ascertain the specific subcellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein we fused the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence to the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . as seen in figure _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein in yeast provides a partial complementation of the _PROTEIN_ growth defect in glycerol as previously described for _PROTEIN_ . yeast cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were incubated with the lipophilic styryl dye which mostly localizes to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ under these conditions . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localizes intracellularly and only partially overlaps the yeast _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . therefore a likely explanation for the partial complementation of _PROTEIN_ to the respiratory defects of the yeast cells defective in high affinity cu transport through the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ could be its mostly intracellular localization pattern . to ascertain the subcellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein in plants we _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein under the control of the endogenous _PROTEIN_ promoter in wild type arabidopsis plants and analyzed the roots by confocal microscopy . importantly the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein complements the root elongation phenotype of _PROTEIN_ plants under cu deficient conditions . to distinguish separate cells we visualized the cell wall of root cells by staining with propidium iodide _METHOD_ . interestingly _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ displays an intracellular punctate pattern throughout the root cells . when cells from the shoot were analyzed the intracellular _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ pattern did not colocalize with the chloroplasts . instead _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ partially colocalized with the endocytic tracer . to further ascertain the subcellular compartment corresponding to this localization pattern we transiently _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein into arabidopsis protoplasts under the control of the promoter . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal displays a similar punctate distribution that in most cases localizes in the proximity of the chloroplasts . to determine the nature of these _LOCATION_ foci or vesicles we simultaneously _PROTEIN_ the protein that was epitope tagged with the red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . previous studies have demonstrated that the mutation of the dilysine motif within an arabidopsis protein leads to a punctate distribution that _PROTEIN_ corresponds to the pvc as previously demonstrated by its colocalization with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . as shown in figure the signal from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overlaps _METHOD_ indicating that the _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ localizes to the pvc in arabidopsis cells . the topology associated with the ctr/copt proteins predicts a directional transport of cu toward the _LOCATION_ . therefore these results suggest that the intracellular _PROTEIN_ protein could function in mobilizing cu from the lumen of prevacuolar vesicles toward the _LOCATION_ . previous studies using mature leaves excised from arabidopsis plants indicate that unlike _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the steady state levels of _PROTEIN_ mrna do not significantly change under a different cu status . more recent results have demonstrated that the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis roots is up regulated in a _PROTEIN_ dependent manner when plants are grown under cu deficient conditions . to further study how cu influences _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ we grew arabidopsis seedlings for or days in media with different cu availabilities extracted total rna and analyzed the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by rt pcr and qpcr . while the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ increases upon cu depletion for days the _PROTEIN_ mrna levels do not significantly change . similar results were obtained for the day old seedlings . to address whether the regulation by cu status occurs at the protein level we grew plants constitutively _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ha for week under the control of the promoter under cu deficiency _METHOD_ or cu excess _METHOD_ . the western blot analysis did not show any significant alteration in the _PROTEIN_ protein levels . these results suggest that the steady state _PROTEIN_ mrna and protein levels are not regulated by cu availability . to further investigate the role of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis physiology we decided to determine the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ at the tissue level . for this purpose we fused the promoter region of _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ to the uida reporter gene which encodes _PROTEIN_ . stable transgenic arabidopsis lines harboring the gus construct were obtained and analyzed for gus activity . the histological staining shows that _PROTEIN_ is highly _PROTEIN_ in primary root and root hairs . a more detailed dissection of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in roots reveals that it is associated with the endodermis and vascular tissues . in the aerial part the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels are much lower than those detected in roots . once more the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is mostly concentrated in the vascular tissues of the hypocotyl the cotyledons and the leaves at different developmental stages . we also observed gus staining in the trichomes the apical caulinar meristem and the vascular tissue of etiolated seedlings . the histological analysis of reproductive organs from adult plants shows _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in ovules and pistils . the filament is the only stained structure in the anther and unlike the _PROTEIN_ cu transporter _PROTEIN_ is not _PROTEIN_ in pollen . finally siliques show the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ at the level of vascular conducts embryos and furuncles . the embryo displays a homogenous _PROTEIN_ pattern . no alterations in the _PROTEIN_ spatial _PROTEIN_ pattern were observed when the gus lines were grown in media with different cu availabilities . thus _PROTEIN_ is mostly _PROTEIN_ along the vascular conducts of the plant predominantly in roots which is consistent with a function in cu supply and distribution throughout the plant .
arabidopsis seeds were sterilized and stratified for days at . then seeds were sown on murashige skoog at half strength _METHOD_ containing agar and sucrose and moved to chambers with a photoperiod of

amplification of _PROTEIN_ orf and cloning into the _METHOD_ vector . the sequence encoding for the hemagglutinin ha antigen was included with the reverse oligonucleotide to tag the _PROTEIN_ protein at its _PROTEIN_ terminus . to construct the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plasmid the promoter region of _PROTEIN_ was fused to the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ sequence _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to be cloned into the _METHOD_

complemented line . to obtain the _PROTEIN_ lines the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ ha construct was integrated into the genome of the arabidopsis wild type plants and the lines with the highest _PROTEIN_ ha _PROTEIN_ were selected by high affinity anti ha western blot analyses . the oligonucleotides amplifying the whole orf were used to ascertain the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels by rt pcr . the yeast _PROTEIN_ mutant strain was transformed with or with a vector containing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and was assayed for growth on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ glycerol and glycerol cu media
