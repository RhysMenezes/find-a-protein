during waterlogging and the associated oxygen deprivation stress plants respond by the induction of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ including the redirected _PROTEIN_ of gene networks toward the synthesis of core hypoxia response proteins . among these core response proteins in arabidopsis is the calcium sensor _PROTEIN_ a protein related to regulator of gene silencing calmodulin like proteins _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ transcripts are up regulated more than fold in roots within h of hypoxia treatment . transfer dna insertional mutants of _PROTEIN_ show an enhanced sensitivity to hypoxia stress with lowered survival and more severe inhibition of root and shoot growth . by using yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ translational fusions _PROTEIN_ protein was found to be localized to _LOCATION_ granule structures similar in morphology to hypoxia induced stress granules . immunoprecipitation of _PROTEIN_ from the roots of hypoxia _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants harboring _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ followed by liquid chromatography tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis revealed the presence of protein targets associated with messenger rna ribonucleoprotein complexes including stress granules which are known to accumulate as messenger rna storage and triage centers during hypoxia . this finding is further supported by the colocalization of _PROTEIN_ with the mrnp stress granule marker rna binding protein _PROTEIN_ upon cotransfection of nicotiana benthamiana leaves . ruthenium red treatment results in the loss of _PROTEIN_ signal in _LOCATION_ granules suggesting that calcium is necessary for stress granule association . these results confirm that _PROTEIN_ is a core hypoxia response calcium sensor protein and suggest that it serves as a potential calcium signaling target within stress granules and other mrnps that accumulate during flooding stress responses .
analysis of the flooding and hypoxia induced transcript levels from a variety of microarray studies shows that among the cml and seven _PROTEIN_ calcium sensor genes _PROTEIN_ is uniquely and acutely up regulated in response to hypoxia . phylogenetic analysis of _PROTEIN_ shows that it is part of a small subfamily of genes in arabidopsis with structural and sequence homology to the regulator of gene silencing rgscam protein from tobacco . the most closely related protein to _PROTEIN_ is a tandem gene _PROTEIN_ with amino acid sequence identity to _PROTEIN_ . since microarray results might not resolve the _PROTEIN_ of these two closely related gene products _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcript levels in arabidopsis seedlings _PROTEIN_ with hypoxia by complete submergence were assayed by quantitative reverse transcription pcr . _PROTEIN_ showed acute elevation of transcript levels _PROTEIN_ while _PROTEIN_ showed only a minor increase . the tissue specific _PROTEIN_ profile of _PROTEIN_ during submergence stress was analyzed using _PROTEIN_ promoter gus transgenic plants . under normoxic conditions _PROTEIN_ gus seedlings showed a basal level of _PROTEIN_ at the hypocotyl root junction in untreated seedlings . however submergence of seedlings resulted in a rapid elevation of gus activity in both root and shoot tissue in support of the q pcr results . these findings confirm previous work that has placed _PROTEIN_ into the small group of core hypoxia response genes and suggest that _PROTEIN_ may play a specialized role as a calcium sensor during this response . mutations that target core hypoxia response genes in general result in a lower survival and/or increased sensitivity to anaerobic stress . to determine the effects of the elimination of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ on arabidopsis survival to anaerobic stress a transfer dna mutant _PROTEIN_ line with an insertion site within the coding region of _PROTEIN_ was characterized . q pcr analysis confirmed that _PROTEIN_ plants do not _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ transcript in response to hypoxia induction . argon induced anaerobiosis resulted in chlorosis of the apical shoot reduction in the length of the primary root and reduction in seedling growth of most of the _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings with a survival rate significantly lower than wild type plants . to test whether this effect was the result of reduced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants were transformed with an _PROTEIN_ construct consisting of _PROTEIN_ fused to c terminal yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . these plants showed recovery of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as well as restoration of survival frequencies to argon mediated stress that were indistinguishable from wild type plants . this suggests that the loss of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was responsible for the greater sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ to anaerobic stress . to investigate the dynamics of _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ as well as its subcellular localization transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with an in frame c terminal _METHOD_ fusion _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were generated using a recombineering method . the advantage of this approach is that it results in in situ production of a gene encoding the protein of interest tagged with a _METHOD_ reporter within the larger genomic context which avoids the exclusion of cis regulatory elements . to verify that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ recombineering plants respond to hypoxia treatment plants grown hydroponically were perfused with nitrogen gas and the levels of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transcripts and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein were analyzed . q pcr confirmed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was induced by low oxygen conditions peaking at h and remaining elevated throughout the assay period . analysis of _PROTEIN_ protein levels by western blot with an anti _METHOD_ antibody showed rapid accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein with a peak reached between and h after hypoxia induction . the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ was investigated by _METHOD_ microscopy of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ recombineering plants . consistent with western blot analysis normoxic plants showed the absence of _METHOD_ signal while hypoxia triggered the appearance of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signal detected by h after the onset of hypoxia and peaking by h . higher resolution images obtained by confocal _METHOD_ microscopy showed that the _METHOD_ signal consists of distinct _LOCATION_ granule structures with sizes ranging to . statistical analysis of the size distribution of particles indicated two size classes one approximately to and a second with an average of . to identify the potential targets of _PROTEIN_ as well as the identity of the granulated structures in hypoxic roots immunoprecipitation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ from extracts of root tissue from hypoxia treated arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants was performed followed by tryptic digestion and liquid chromatography tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ peptide fingerprinting . analyses of mock negative control immunoprecipitation samples from the hypoxia treated wild type and a _METHOD_ transgenic background were used to identify and exclude false positives . by this approach a total of proteins were identified as _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ interacting proteins which could be divided into nine functional categories based on _PROTEIN_ analysis . potential insight into the nature of the _PROTEIN_ granulated structures observed in figure came from the observation that a subset of the _PROTEIN_ interacting proteins have been characterized previously as proteins associated with messenger rna nucleoprotein particles and/or rna processing functions . a summary of this protein subset shows that they can be classified into several functional mrnp categories including ribosomal proteins translation initiation _PROTEIN_ heat shock proteins and chaperones proteins associated with ubiquitination and protein degradation mrna processing and degradation proteins other rna binding proteins and proteins associated with posttranscriptional gene silencing . the appearance of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ granulated bodies in the hypoxia _PROTEIN_ seedlings and the finding of mrnp granule markers in _PROTEIN_ immunoprecipitates suggest that the appearance of _PROTEIN_ granules may be the result of localization to hypoxia induced stress granules . it is well established that part of the hypoxia response in plants is the rapid formation of sg mrnp bodies that serve as translationally repressed mrna triage centers that facilitate the storage and/or transfer of mrna to other rna nucleoproteins during _PROTEIN_ to hypoxia stress . to test this hypothesis the colocalization of _PROTEIN_ with the sg specific marker protein _PROTEIN_ under hypoxia stress was investigated by transient cotransfection assays of nicotiana benthamiana leaves with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ constructs . as described previously n. benthamiana cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ show the appearance of _METHOD_ signal within _LOCATION_ granule structures within minutes of hypoxia initiation . similarly transfection of n. benthamiana with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ shows the accumulation of _LOCATION_ granules . in cells cotransfected with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ both _METHOD_ proteins show similar appearance of _LOCATION_ granules as well as appearance in the cell _LOCATION_ within min of hypoxia induction . comparison of the merged images of cotransfected cells shows substantial colocalization of the two proteins within _LOCATION_ granules as well as the _LOCATION_ . the degree of colocalization between _PROTEIN_ and was quantified by cross correlation analysis using the method of citation fig . . this method relies on cross correlation analysis by computationally shifting one image _PROTEIN_ relative to the other image and calculating the pearson coefficient . the pc is a quantitative measure of the pixel overlap in superimposed merged dual channel images . pc values range from to with representing theoretical complete correlation between the two fluorophores representing complete exclusion of the images and representing a random distribution of each image . analysis of merged _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ images shows a calculated pc value of supporting strong colocalization of the two _METHOD_ signals . this result supports the prediction from the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ experiments as well as the known properties of sg dynamics in hypoxia stressed arabidopsis and argues that the _METHOD_ granules found in hypoxic arabidopsis roots in cml _METHOD_ plants correspond at least in part to hypoxia induced sgs . in further support of this treatment of complementation plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with cycloheximide which prevents the assembly of sgs results in the loss of _METHOD_ signal in particulate structures and accumulation in the cell _LOCATION_ . calcium sensor ef hand proteins including _PROTEIN_ exhibit calcium dependent conformational changes that are associated with the regulation of function through interaction with cellular target proteins . to investigate the role of calcium binding in _PROTEIN_ s association with _LOCATION_ granules the effects of rr were investigated . rr lowers _LOCATION_ calcium levels by the inhibition of intracellular channels and it has been shown previously to suppress the hypoxia induced response in plant roots . application of rr to n. benthamiana leaves led to the loss of _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ granules within min of application with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ detected solely within foci in the _LOCATION_ . similarly rr treatment of hypoxia _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ recombineering plants results in a rapid loss of _METHOD_ signal in granules . to determine whether the effect of rr was on _PROTEIN_ s association with sg or on the general integrity of these structures its effect on n. benthamiana leaf cells cotransfected with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was assessed . the results show that rr treatment exhibited little effect on the association of _PROTEIN_ with sgs while the _PROTEIN_ signal associated with these structures was lost in a time dependent manner suggesting that rr has no effect on sg integrity . thus it appears as if calcium is necessary for _PROTEIN_ s association with sg structures presumably through the calcium dependent sensor function of _PROTEIN_ . previous studies in both animals and plants show that recovery from stress conditions is accompanied by the disassembly of sg structures and the degradation of sg associated proteins . consistent with this observation reoxygenation of hypoxia treated arabidopsis cml _METHOD_ recombineering seedlings results in a _PROTEIN_ in transcript levels within h of reoxygenation . this is followed by a decline in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein levels and the disappearance of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ granule structures with the western blot protein signal and _METHOD_ granules no longer apparent at to h after reoxygenation .
