supramolecular organization of enzymes is proposed to orchestrate metabolic complexity and help channel intermediates in different pathways . phenylpropanoid metabolism has to direct up to of the _PROTEIN_ fixed by plants to the biosynthesis of lignin precursors . effective coupling of the enzymes in the pathway thus _METHOD_ to be required . subcellular localization mobility protein protein and protein _LOCATION_ interactions of four consecutive enzymes around the _PROTEIN_ branch point leading to lignin precursors was investigated in leaf tissues of nicotiana benthamiana and cells of arabidopsis thaliana . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the two arabidopsis cytochrome catalyzing para and meta hydroxylations of the phenolic _PROTEIN_ of monolignols were found to colocalize in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and to form homo and heteromers . they moved along with the fast remodeling plant _LOCATION_ but their _PROTEIN_ diffusion on the _LOCATION_ surface was restricted likely due to association with other _LOCATION_ proteins . the connecting soluble enzyme hydroxycinnamoyltransferase _PROTEIN_ was found partially associated with the _LOCATION_ . both _PROTEIN_ and the coumaroyl coa ligase relocalized closer to the _LOCATION_ upon _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ lifetime imaging microscopy supports colocalization and interaction with the soluble proteins enhanced by the _PROTEIN_ of the partner proteins . protein relocalization was further enhanced in tissues undergoing wound repair . _PROTEIN_ was the most effective in driving protein association .
based on data from animal _METHOD_ are pictured as proteins with free _PROTEIN_ mobility in a slowly remodeling _LOCATION_ . to test if this applies to plant enzymes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ as enhanced _METHOD_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins in plant _LOCATION_ by transfection of n. benthamiana leaves . since these are anchored to the _LOCATION_ through an n terminal signal peptide they were _METHOD_ tagged at the c terminus . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ behaved as typical _LOCATION_ proteins when compared with free and _LOCATION_ retained _METHOD_ . determination of _PROTEIN_ and activities in the microsomal _LOCATION_ of transformed leaves indicated that the nadph cytochrome reductase from n. benthamiana successfully reduced the enzymes from arabidopsis . based on relative activities detected in microsomes from leaves _PROTEIN_ the native and tagged proteins _METHOD_ tagging caused and reduction in enzyme activity for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . the presence of the _METHOD_ tag at the c terminus is expected to produce a steric hindrance for interaction with its electron donor cpr since the c terminus and regions involved in electron transfer are located on the same face of the protein . however the near residual activity of the tagged enzymes indicates that the presence of the _METHOD_ does not completely prevent the cpr interaction . the plant _LOCATION_ is described as being very dynamic and constantly remodeling . time lapse imaging of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as _METHOD_ fused proteins _PROTEIN_ illustrates their fast movement in the plant cell together with the _LOCATION_ network . the samples were then treated with the actin depolymerizing agent latrunculin b that limits movement to diffusion but preserves the _LOCATION_ structure . lamellar _LOCATION_ regions were then selected for _METHOD_ recovery after photobleaching experiments to evaluate _PROTEIN_ protein diffusion on the surface of the _LOCATION_ . figure compares bleaching and recovery recorded with plant leaves _PROTEIN_ free and _LOCATION_ retained _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs . bleaching was close to and recovery was nearly complete within s for _METHOD_ hdel . bleaching was above and recovery very low and limited for both _METHOD_ constructs . no bleaching was observed for soluble free _METHOD_ nor for _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the _PROTEIN_ diffusion of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ enzymes on the surface of the _LOCATION_ appears thus restricted either due to supramolecular organization or the anchoring on a _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ component . to investigate interaction of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with other _LOCATION_ proteins both of them were used as baits in tandem affinity purification experiments performed with that were c terminally tagged with the protein g streptavidin tag and _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis cell suspension cultures . tap tagging was performed in cells grown under standard conditions and under conditions inducing differentiation to tracheary elements and secondary wall deposition which enhances _PROTEIN_ of the lignin pathway . using _PROTEIN_ as bait _PROTEIN_ was copurified two times in three independent tap experiments and this occurred only under inducing conditions . two other proteins the phytoalexin _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ reported to catalyze the final steps in camalexin synthesis and an esterase of unknown function copurified with both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ only under inducing conditions . furthermore the nadh cytochrome reductase another _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with as yet unknown activity as well as a number of structural proteins copurified with both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but independent from the induction conditions . among them were several members of the reticulon family that were shown to contribute to _LOCATION_ tubule shaping and to interact with _LOCATION_ resident proteins . other _PROTEIN_ ligands included a family protein that is the arabidopsis homolog of the _LOCATION_ lipid raft associated proteins _LOCATION_ found associated with high molecular weight protein complexes in mammalian cells and two proteins containing a _PROTEIN_ domain _PROTEIN_ that is thought to be involved in calcium dependent phospholipid binding and in _LOCATION_ targeting processes . finally _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ binding _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ a plant vamp associated protein _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ methyl _PROTEIN_ interacted with both cyps in all repeats and conditions . _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ can bind to progesterone brassinolide and stigmasterol with different affinities and presumably have a role in steroid signaling . _PROTEIN_ was demonstrated to be important for the _LOCATION_ localization of sterol binding proteins . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ impacts sterol composition of the _LOCATION_ and is associated with vascular patterning . _LOCATION_ the yeast homolog of _PROTEIN_ has been shown to belong to an _LOCATION_ complex of sterol biosynthetic enzymes in saccharomyces cerevisiae . a similar tap experiment using as bait an unrelated enzyme of unknown function _PROTEIN_ did not identify any of the interactors in table . such a robust set of proteins interacting with both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ thus supports the hypothesis of a specific _LOCATION_ anchoring complex limiting mobility on the _LOCATION_ surface . and _PROTEIN_ are described as soluble proteins . their subcellular localization was compared with that of their _LOCATION_ bound partner _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in transfected n. benthamiana . and _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ as both n terminal and c terminal _METHOD_ fusions to allow all possible interactions with the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ bound proteins . _METHOD_ tagging of the or _PROTEIN_ did not hamper their catalytic activities indicating that the fusion proteins were functional . solubility of and _PROTEIN_ was attested by their transport into the _LOCATION_ and further supported by high mobility observed in frap analysis . free diffusion of both enzymes is comparable to that of free _METHOD_ and too fast for detectable photobleaching . however both and _PROTEIN_ generate a fuzzy reticulate pattern in the parietal regions of the cell . this reticulate pattern is due to the squeezing of the cytoplasm between the turgescent _LOCATION_ and the cell wall but might also be indicative of a partial association of the soluble enzymes with the _LOCATION_ as previously reported for tobacco _PROTEIN_ . we thus analyzed the distribution of the _METHOD_ tagged and _PROTEIN_ proteins near the _LOCATION_ tubules and compared it to the distribution of the free _METHOD_ _METHOD_ fused to the hdel _LOCATION_ retention signal and to _METHOD_ by image analysis of _METHOD_ as recently described by citation . the statistical analysis of the _METHOD_ pixels around the _LOCATION_ tubules indicated a similar distribution for _METHOD_ and whereas _PROTEIN_ was found more closely associated with the _LOCATION_ . to confirm _LOCATION_ association of _PROTEIN_ soluble fractions and washed microsomal _LOCATION_ were prepared from leaves of n. benthamiana _PROTEIN_ the soluble tag free protein before testing enzyme activity . significant activity was found associated with the microsome fraction . _PROTEIN_ activity was also detected in washed microsomes isolated from control noninfiltrated plants . _LOCATION_ association was further confirmed by immunodetection of _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ fraction prepared after transient _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ fusion protein . taken together our data indicate partial association of _PROTEIN_ with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ which is reminiscent of what was previously reported for _PROTEIN_ . this association can be detected with isolated _LOCATION_ and in vivo . to test if proteins may influence _LOCATION_ association of their soluble partners we evaluated the impact of _PROTEIN_ on the localization of _PROTEIN_ and . in a first step each soluble protein was coexpressed with each . soluble proteins were tagged with _METHOD_ and with monomeric red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ for confirmation of their _PROTEIN_ in the cells selected for measurement . after optimization in standard experiments visual assessment indicated that nearly of the epidermal cells _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ proteins . coexpression with _PROTEIN_ triggered a significant relocalization of both _PROTEIN_ and nearer to the _LOCATION_ independent of the position of the tag . _PROTEIN_ did not influence the distribution of free _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ a enzyme involved in isoprenoid metabolism did not modify the distribution of both _PROTEIN_ and . localization of the soluble proteins was little affected by the coexpression of _PROTEIN_ with redistribution of closer to the _LOCATION_ detected only when _METHOD_ was fused at its c terminus . we next tested the effect of addition of the two additional partner enzymes the latter _PROTEIN_ without tags to keep the steric interference of the _METHOD_ tags minimal . significant redistribution in the presence of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was observed only in the case of _METHOD_ which was not pulled closer to the _LOCATION_ by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ alone . no further change in protein distribution was detected when or _PROTEIN_ were already drawn closer to the _LOCATION_ by the _PROTEIN_ of a single protein . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ thus _METHOD_ to drive redistribution of _PROTEIN_ and near the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ while _PROTEIN_ only has a minor effect . supramolecular organization of the lignin pathway would imply protein protein interaction or at least local concentration of the partners involved . indeed tap tagging experiments performed with _PROTEIN_ led to repeated copurification of _PROTEIN_ . to further corroborate protein interaction or association the different target proteins were coexpressed as fusion constructs with different _METHOD_ proteins suitable for _METHOD_ lifetime imaging microscopy . first we investigated the self and cross interactions . fret detected upon _PROTEIN_ of different combinations was compared with fret obtained upon _PROTEIN_ with free _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ anchored into the cytoplasmic surface of _LOCATION_ via the n terminal signal peptide of the plant sterol demethylase _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ as a negative control . background fret values were detected between soluble free _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ proteins . fret between anchored _METHOD_ and yielded comparable values . by contrast a high fret value of between _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ indicated a high propensity to dimerize or oligomerize . the fret value was also significant although lower upon coexpression of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . tests for cross interactions between and provided fret values ranging from to depending on the donor and acceptor protein which most likely reflects a variable environment caused by the fusion with the _METHOD_ probes . as an additional negative control we determined the fret values resulting from the coexpression of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ a enzyme involved in isoprenoid metabolism which never exceeded . taken together our data support the formation of homo and heteromers of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . tighter protein interaction is observed with _PROTEIN_ alone or in combination with _PROTEIN_ . the association of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ and was tested in the presence or absence of the other two partner enzymes . flim analysis was first performed to investigate interaction of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . low fret values were indicative of no or poor interaction of _PROTEIN_ with or _PROTEIN_ . however association of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ was significantly increased upon coexpression of _PROTEIN_ and with fret values reaching to . a similar flim analysis was performed to test _PROTEIN_ association with _PROTEIN_ or . fret values of indicated proximity of _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ in the absence of the other partner enzymes . this association seemed to involve specific regions of the proteins since it occurred only with the n terminal tagged _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . in the latter configuration interaction was not further enhanced by the coexpression of _PROTEIN_ and . conversely interaction of _PROTEIN_ with the c terminal tagged _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ required the coexpression of partner protein that favored close proximity of the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ labels in the complex as indicated by a high fret value of . no interaction of _PROTEIN_ with was detected in the absence of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . however coexpression of the latter proteins drove _PROTEIN_ association independent of the position of the _METHOD_ tag on . finally we tested if it was possible to detect and _PROTEIN_ association . background fret values between and were measured between the soluble proteins with all possible combinations of fusions with _METHOD_ probes . upon coexpression of the enzymes an average fret of was detected with the _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ combination . while this suggests possible spatial reorganization and closer proximity of the soluble proteins in the presence of partner it remains too low to conclude . however values reached close to in a small number of cells where relocalization was clearly visible in confocal images . the _PROTEIN_ responsible for this conditional interaction could not be identified from the inspection of the leaf tissues . the conditional interactions observed in the differential tap tagging of the _LOCATION_ proteins upon induced lignification in plant cells raised the question whether protein interaction or association can be influenced by the physiological status of the plant and/or the metabolic flux in the phenylpropanoid pathway . mechanical injury is known to activate the _PROTEIN_ of the genes of the phenolic pathway to support lignin and suberin deposition in the wound periderm near the wound site and activated _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ around wounded leaf tissues was reported in arabidopsis . injury might thus provide a natural context favoring protein association . hence we investigated enzyme localization in the cell layers located in a wound healing zone . transfected leaves of n. benthamiana were injured with a nail board h before evaluation of protein relocalization in the healing cell layer . no wounding effect was detected with _METHOD_ used as negative control . relocalization was observed with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ alone or coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or with a combination of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . relocalization of _PROTEIN_ was detected only when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ . flim analysis was then performed to determine if this resulted in enhanced protein association . wounding did not result in significant changes in fret values upon _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ tagged in any combination with other potential partners . by contrast a clear wound effect was observed on the combinations with an average fret value of measured in the healing zone compared with in healthy tissues . as already mentioned above relocalization of the soluble proteins was visible in only a fraction of the cells when all four enzymes were present . this fraction increased to of the cells in the wound periphery . fret values reached between _METHOD_ cl and _PROTEIN_ in these cells . the wound healing context thus _METHOD_ to favor association of and _PROTEIN_ in the presence of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ .
