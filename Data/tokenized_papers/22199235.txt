the eukaryotic transcription _PROTEIN_ nf y consists of three subunits which are encoded in arabidopsis thaliana in multigene families consisting of and genes respectively . in principle all potential combinations of the subunits are possible for the assembly of the heterotrimeric complex . we aimed at assessing the probability of each subunit to participate in the assembly of nf y . the evaluation of physical interactions among all members of the nf y subunit families indicate a strong requirement for nf yb/nf yc heterodimerization before the entire complex can be accomplished . by means of a modified yeast two hybrid system assembly of all three subunits to a heterotrimeric complex was demonstrated . using _METHOD_ fusion constructs nf ya and nf yc localization in the _LOCATION_ was demonstrated while nf yb is solely imported into the _LOCATION_ as a nf yc associated heterodimer nf yc . this piggyback transport of the two arabidopsis subunits differs from the import of the nf y heterotrimer of heterotrophic _METHOD_ . based on a peptide structure model of the histone fold motifs disulfide bonding among intramolecular conserved cysteine residues of nf yb which is responsible for the redox regulated assembly of nf yb and nf yc in human and aspergillus nidulans can be excluded for arabidopsis nf yb .
the entire nf y complex of aspergillus nidulans was reported to be translocated into the _LOCATION_ . it remains open whether this translocation mechanism can also be established for the multiple nf y complexes in plants . we intended to demonstrate the subcellular localization of representatives of the three nf y subunits from arabidopsis . nf nf nf nf and nf were _PROTEIN_ with a c terminal _METHOD_ fusion under the control of the camv promoter in arabidopsis leaves after transformation via particle bombardment . nf nf and nf were exclusively detected in the _LOCATION_ of the transformed leaf cells . in contrast the two nf ybs nf and nf are found to be localized in the cytoplasm . the subcellular localization of nf yb was modified after co _PROTEIN_ of camv nf . upon concomitant co transformation and _PROTEIN_ of nf and nf _METHOD_ or nf _METHOD_ fusion proteins nf yb dominantly accumulated inside the _LOCATION_ of transformed cells . in contrast to nf ya and nf yc all nf ybs lack nls . nf ybs are proposed to be transported into the _LOCATION_ after interaction with nf yc while nf ya and nf yc are imported into the _LOCATION_ without auxiliary assistance . in conclusion the interaction between nf and nf in the cytoplasm is an essential prerequisite for the translocation of nf yb into the _LOCATION_ and follows a piggyback mechanism . the physical interaction of nf as well as nf with nf was additionally demonstrated in vitro by performing pull down assays in planta using the bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation method and in vivo by yeast two hybrid experiments . in one experimental approach recombinant _PROTEIN_ fused nf was immobilized on glutathione beads and subjected to in vitro translation extracts with labeled nf and nf . nf and nf were released from the glutathione beads in substantially higher amounts after interaction with _PROTEIN_ nf than without this interaction partner . in planta nf _METHOD_ n and nf _METHOD_ n fusions as well as nf _METHOD_ c and nf _METHOD_ c fusion proteins were able to interact with nf _METHOD_ c and nf _METHOD_ n respectively resulting in the reconstitution of the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signal . the subcellular localization of the heterodimers nf and nf dimers was predominantly inside the _LOCATION_ . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ did not merge with the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ emitted by the _METHOD_ tagged _LOCATION_ marker which was co transformed with the nf y fusion gene constructs . as control any combination of nf ny _PROTEIN_ or nf as _METHOD_ n or _METHOD_ c fusion protein with the empty corresponding non recombinant _METHOD_ n and _METHOD_ c containing vector did not result in detectable _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . following the hypothesis of combinatorial diversity of arabidopsis nf y subunits we assayed the bilateral interactions of arabidopsis nf y proteins as bait and prey fusions in the diploid yeast cells via the _PROTEIN_ of the yeast two hybrid reporter genes his and lacz before the potential combinations of each subunit in a heterotrimeric complex is assessed . a maximum of different combinations of two interacting arabidopsis nf y proteins can be achieved with the total number of members within the three nf y subunit families . considering that the coding sequence of each of the arabidopsis nf y subunits is inserted in bait and prey fusion gene constructs respectively the proteins can be combined in different possibilities in a yeast two hybrid approach . in total of the possible combinations were analyzed in our yeast two hybrid experiments _PROTEIN_ . the total number of combinations was reduced because four proteins were not considered for the readout . first nf and nf y _PROTEIN_ annotated also as _PROTEIN_ binding protein associated phosphoproteins like proteins were only functional as prey fusions in the yeast two hybrid experiments and could not be investigated in the opposite combination as a bait fusion protein . second nf and nf evidently did not interact with any other protein in the whole interactome approach . for the evaluation of our interactome assay protein protein interactions are accepted as positive when the protein protein interactions were reliably induced galactosidase levels over . ninety two combinations were determined in only one combination of bait and prey constructs whereas interactions among two nf y proteins could be proofed in both reciprocal bait/prey combinations resulting in total in protein protein interactions through unidirectional and reverse combination of bait and prey vectors . _PROTEIN_ displays the survey of the nf y interactome and highlights the positive protein protein interactions among the three nf y subunits . an additional criterion for reproducible protein protein interaction was included . only protein protein interactions were accepted when they were verified in our yeast two hybrid experiments in both reciprocal combinations . based on these settings of all established bilateral interactions were determined among proteins of the nf yc and nf yb families . two combinations of nf ya and nf yc proteins displayed positive interactions in both reciprocal combinations of bait and prey vectors whereas no interaction among a single nf ya and nf yb could be established . related to the maximum number of possible nf yb/nf yc combinations of all possible interactions among each member of the two subunit families were verified with the yeast two hybrid system . only two out of possible nf ya/nf yc interactions were detected in our interactome assay and no nf ya/nf yb interaction . moreover except for the combination nf no single interaction among members of the same nf y subunit family as well as no homodimerization of arabidopsis nf y proteins could be verified _PROTEIN_ indicating that the nf y subunits do not tend to associate with other members of the same subunit family or to form homodimers . in total of possible bilateral arabidopsis nf yb and nf yc interactions were detected in both combinations of bait and prey fusions in the yeast two hybrid experiments . in particular nf yb and seven nf yc proteins interact in a high number of combinations to form different heterodimers whereas three nf yb _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and five nf yc proteins interacted only with a considerably smaller number or none of the members of the other subunit family . to suggest reasons for their inability to form bilateral interactions we compared the primary amino acid sequence of each member within the nf y families of b and c subunits in a sequence alignment . considering in addition the three dimensional crystal structure of the human nf yb/c heterodimer both proteins dimerise by anti parallel annealing of their central _METHOD_ similar to the mechanism proposed for histone subunits . comparison of the peptide sequences of the _METHOD_ of the arabidopsis nf yb proteins revealed the high similarity to their human ortholog except for the _METHOD_ of nf _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which show a lower similarity . this dissimilarity of the hfm interface of nf _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to nf yc could explain the restriction of these three b subunits to interact with nf yc proteins . as mentioned above five nf yc proteins were remarkably limited in their capability to bind nf yb proteins . three of them show a low similarity in their conserved _METHOD_ in comparison to the hfm of the human nf yc subunit . it is proposed that this lower similarity caused a reduced structural integrity of the hfm and a lower binding capacity to the corresponding nf yb subunits . according to the three dimensional structure model of the human nf yb/yc heterodimer each subunit possesses an intramolecular hydrogen bond within the hfm between the arg and asp of the human nf yb and arg and asp of nf yc . both arginine aspartate pairs are highly conserved throughout evolution and can be found in nf yb and nf yc subunits of several species . the arginine aspartate pairs consequently seem to be important for the mutual interaction between both nf y subunit families . it is suggested that the peptide motif is functional in stabile structural conformations of nf yb and nf yc through the _METHOD_ . sequence alignments revealed with the exception of nf and _PROTEIN_ that all arabidopsis nf yb subunits possess the highly conserved aspartate and arginine residues at the corresponding positions in their _METHOD_ . this structural consistency correlates with the abilities of nf yb subunits to interact with nf yc subunits . all arabidopsis subunits of the nf yc family which interact with a large number of nf yb subunits also contain the two highly conserved amino acid residues in their hfm . the remaining members of the nf yc family which are characterized with a lower nf yb binding capacity in our yeast two hybrid experiments like nf and have a substitution at least at one of the conserved aspartate or arginine residues . nf is characterized by a specific feature of an additional insertion of six amino acid residues in the hfm bordered by the conserved aspartate and arginine residues . in conclusion these sequence comparisons suggest an essential role of the intramolecular h bond formation formed by conserved amino acid residues in the hfm of arabidopsis nf yb and nf yc subunits for the capability of protein protein interaction . the evaluation of successful interactions between nf yb and nf yc subunits by yeast two hybrid experiments revealed a substantial list of candidates of nf yb und nf yc subunits . the final assembly of heterotrimeric complexes of plant nf y requires stable interaction of nf yb and nf yc proteins with the nf ya subunit . we assessed positive interactions of three different nf y subunits in a modified yeast two hybrid approach . after transformation of yeast cells with nf ya/nf yb prey and bait gene fusions the additional vector construct pvt nf was introduced . our yeast two hybrid experiments showed that nf and nf did not interact with nf independently from their respective _PROTEIN_ as bait or prey fusion peptide . by means of additional _PROTEIN_ of the recombinant nf the interaction between nf and nf as well as nf and nf was shown by the successful _PROTEIN_ of and lacz reporter genes . as already previously shown for the assembly of the trimeric human nf y complex in vitro the initial formation of nf yb/nf yc heterodimer is predicted to be obligatory for a stable interaction of arabidopsis nf ya with the other two subunits . in accordance with a stepwise assembly mechanism described for nf y assembly of aspergillus nidulans saccharomyces cerevisiae and homo sapiens the plant nf ya apparently requires the combined protein surface of the nf yb/nf yc dimer . a piggyback transport of the complete heterotrimeric nf y complex into the _LOCATION_ was reported for the filamentous fungus aspergillus nidulans . thereby hapc and hape form first a heterodimer by head to tail annealing of their _METHOD_ . an intramolecular disulfide bond between two cysteine residues inside the hfm of hapc controls the heterodimerization . under oxidizing conditions this disulfide bond was proposed to affect structurally the three dimensional conformation of the hfm of hapc and to prevent heterodimerization . aspergillus nidulans conclusively possesses a redox depending molecular switch which controls the spatial distribution of subunits and subcellular localization of the trimeric hap complex . we assessed the probability of intramolecular disulfide bonding of arabidopsis nf yb which could affect the nf yb/nf yc heterodimer formation in a redox dependent manner and their piggyback transport into the _LOCATION_ . all arabidopsi s nf yb subunits have two conserved cysteine residues in the hfm at the positions cys and cys which correspond to cys and cys of human nf yb and cys and cys of a. nidulans hapc . the nf yb of homo sapiens and a. nidulans possess an additional conserved cysteine separated by only three amino acids from _PROTEIN_ which was denominated . redox dependent intramolecular disulfide bonding of the human as well as the fungal nf yb protein was described among cysteine residues and _PROTEIN_ . using the crystal structure of the human nf yb/c heterodimer we modeled the three dimensional arabidopsis nf yb structure _PROTEIN_ its hfm and defined the possible spatial orientation of the conserved cysteine residues as well as the distances of these residues to each other in the protein structure . as result the human nf yb structure _METHOD_ that cysteine and _PROTEIN_ are perfectly arranged in the first helix of the hfm for the preferential formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond whereas disulfide bonding between the cysteine _PROTEIN_ and can be excluded since they would require _METHOD_ changes in the three dimensional conformation of nf yb hfm . in analogy the spatial separation of the two cysteine residues of the arabidopsis nf yb cys _PROTEIN_ and cys does not support intramolecular disulfide bonding in the hfm region . in conclusion an intramolecular disulfide bond of nf yb necessarily requires the conserved cysteine residues and _PROTEIN_ . both cysteine side chains can be found in nf yb of heterotrophic _METHOD_ like h. sapiens and a. nidulans . arabidopsis nf yb subunits as well as nf ybs of other photoautotrophic species do not possess a cysteine residue at the corresponding position to . moreover analyzing the consensus sequence of all nf yb proteins hosted in the plant transcription _PROTEIN_ database no phototrophic species possesses cysteine residue in their nf yb sequences . as a consequence the modulation of the nf yb/nf yc interaction under oxidizing conditions is not expected in these _METHOD_ . to substantiate these assessments we analyzed the effects of changing redox states on the protein protein interaction among nf ybs and nf ycs in vivo . the diploid yeast cells containing bait and prey gene constructs for the arabidopsis and human nf yb subunits were incubated with different concentrations of h o . as a result of these growth conditions human and arabidopsis nf ybs differ in their capability to interact with nf yc of the corresponding organism . whereas the arabidopsis nf heterodimer was stable under normal as well as oxidizing conditions human nf yb did not stably interact with nf yc at more than mm h o . it is suggested that a redox dependent mechanism perturbs the stable interaction between human nf yb and nf yc and it is likely that the side chains of and _PROTEIN_ of nf yb form a redox dependent intramolecular disulfide bond that compromises the heterodimer formation of nf yb and nf yc .

reporter genes was suppressed by adding appropriate concentrations of amino triazole _PROTEIN_ to the sd _PROTEIN_ medium . galactosidase activity assays were performed similarly to that described before . two hundred diploid yeast cultures were harvested by centrifugation and re suspended in _PROTEIN_ buffer before yeast cell walls were disrupted by three freeze thaw cycles consisting of min at and min at . after centrifugation for min at g cell debris was re suspended in mm _PROTEIN_ hcl ph and were measured . for developing onpg colorimetric reaction of z buffer and onpg were added and incubated at for min before the reaction was stopped by adding m nahco . after centrifugation for min at g the supernatant was used for measuring absorbance at nm and calculation of the relative galactosidase activity as described previously . the threshold for a positive protein protein interaction was set at relative galactosidase activity units which was determined for interaction between nf and nf in a yeast two hybrid assay using filter lift assays as described previously . this interaction was the result of a previous screen for interacting proteins of nf as bait and confirmed with an alternative method in a pull down experiment . thus an interaction between two nf y subunits was accepted if relative galactosidase activity of at least two of the three biological replicas and the corresponding mean value of all three replicas of both bait prey combinations exceeded . yeast two hybrid analysis under oxidative conditions was performed following the protocol by . the coding
