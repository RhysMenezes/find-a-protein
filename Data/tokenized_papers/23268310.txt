protein phosphatases type _PROTEIN_ from group a which includes the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ branches are key negative regulators of aba signaling . hai gene had been shown to affect both seed and vegetative responses to aba which is one of _PROTEIN_ clade a in arabidopsis thaliana . transgenic plants containing phai gus _PROTEIN_ displayed gus activity existing in the vascular system of leave veins _METHOD_ and petioles . green _METHOD_ protein fused hai _METHOD_ was found in the _LOCATION_ through transient transformation assays with onion epidermal cells . the water loss assays indicated the loss of function mutants did not show _METHOD_ of wilting and they had still turgid green rosette leaves . the assays of seed germination by exogenous aba and nacl manifested that the loss of function mutants displayed higher insensitivity than wild type plants . taken together the final results suggest that the hai _PROTEIN_ encoded a _LOCATION_ protein and it can be highly induced by aba and wound in arabidposis the stress tolerance phenotype showed a slightly improvement when hai gene was disrupted .
t dna insertion mutants of hai were identified in the salk collection corresponding to donor stock number and it was named hai . sequencing of the t dna flanking region in hai showed that the insertion was localized nine nucleotides upstream of the _PROTEIN_ start codon . t dna insertions severely impaired hai _PROTEIN_ based on reverse transcription pcr . homozygous individuals were identified by three primers pcr method . the primers of sequences of t dna insertion loci of flanking region both sides and within t dna insertion fragment were designed homozygous loss of function mutants were identified from genomic dna with pok/plb/prb primers . pcr amplification results were shown that there was an electrophoretic band amplified from homozygous genomic dna . heterozygous

almost the same with mm nacl . however the green cotyledon percentage of hai mutants was higher than those of wild type and over _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants with mm nacl at days . these experiments indicate that hai gene probably has sensitive function in nacl mediated seed germination inhibition response.fig . mutants enhance nacl insensitive inhibition germination a the seed germination was

without watering wild type plants wilted and many rosette leaves yellowed . a limited improvement was observed under these conditions hai mutants showed a reduced water loss as compared to wild type and over _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants . under these experimental conditions the hai over _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants did not exhibit significant differences in the transpiration rate of detached leaves compared to wild type . however loss of function mutants exhibited a reduced water loss .fig . loss assays was obtained a enhanced drought resistance of hai mutant plants with respect to wild type or over _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants . photographs were taken days after withholding water . b reduced water loss measured in detached leaves of hai mutants as compared to wild type or its over _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants . values are averages from two independent experiments water loss assays was obtained a enhanced drought resistance of hai mutant plants with respect to wild type or over _PROTEIN_

plants . values are averages from two independent experiments detached leaf water loss assays are likely not sensitive enough as to detect such variations which are apparent after long periods of drought . thus whereas wild type plants exhibited a marked water loss under these conditions the aba hypersensitive mutants exhibited a reduced water loss particularly in the case of over _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants . this result was consistent with previous studies conducted in usa . the bp upstream region and bp downstream region of the translational start codon _PROTEIN_ of hai was fused to the gus gene and the resulting construct was transformed into wild type arabidopsis plants to produce a set of independent gus lines . gus activities were not detected in day old transgenic seedling s leaf vein root or stem and except only a little _PROTEIN_ in stem primordia . while the gus staining can be detectable in whole seeding after induced h by aba including in root tip in stem primordia and in leaf vein . gus activities were abundantly detected in the stem and leaf vein of week old mature transgenic plants but barely detected in young silique after aba implied . in addition we also found that the hai promoter was induced under aba and abiotic stresses such as wounding gus activities were largely observed at the wound around such as in leaf vascular system and in around cut side
