ser acetyltransferase catalyzes the formation of o acetyl ser from l ser and acetyl coa leading to synthesis of cys . according to its position at the decisive junction of the pathways of sulfur assimilation and amino acid metabolism satases are subject to regulatory _METHOD_ to control the flux of cys synthesis . in arabidopsis there are five genes encoding satase like proteins . two _METHOD_ and were characterized with respect to their enzymatic properties feedback inhibition by l cys and subcellular localization . functional identity of and was established by complementation of a satase deficient mutant of escherichia coli . _LOCATION_ localization of and was confirmed by using fusion construct with the green _METHOD_ protein . recombinant was not inhibited by l cys while was a strongly feedback inhibited isoform . quantification of _PROTEIN_ patterns indicated that is the dominant form _PROTEIN_ in most tissues examined followed by and . although and were _PROTEIN_ weakly in most tissues _PROTEIN_ was significantly induced under sulfur deficiency and cadmium stress as well as during generative developmental stages implying that and have specific roles when plants are subjected to distinct conditions . transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ the green _METHOD_ protein under the control of the five promoters indicated that in all serat genes the _PROTEIN_ was predominantly localized in the vascular system notably in the phloem . these results demonstrate that arabidopsis employs a complex array of compartment specific satase _METHOD_ with distinct enzymatic properties and _PROTEIN_ patterns to ensure the provision of cys in response to developmental and environmental changes .
the investigation of arabidopsis genome initiative reveals the presence of five putative satase like genes . each isoform localizes to one of the five chromosomes in the genome . cdnas of four satase _METHOD_ sat c sat p sat m and sat were cloned . the fifth gene is the only family member that has not been verified functionally by complementation using a sat deficient cyse mutant of e. coli . until now no systematic nomenclature for satase like proteins in plants has been proposed . in particular arabidopsis satase genes are referred to with several different names that would potentially lead to unnecessary confusion . the phylogenetic tree was calculated using the amino acid sequences of members of the plant satase like gene family available in the databases . satase like proteins are divided into at least three subfamilies assigned as groups and . we have designated the arabidopsis satase like gene family gene as atserat with three subfamilies according to the grouping of the phylogenic tree . the described five arabidopsis _METHOD_ within this nomenclature are and . gene designation of satases from higher plants the previously uncharacterized satase like cdna encoding isoform was isolated based on the information of the arabidopsis genome sequence using _PROTEIN_ pcr . in the database two distinct sequences for were found and . the first deduced amino acids in the sequence were conserved and only differed in the c terminal region . for the deduced sequence of the last four amino acids were hges whereas in the sequence the last four amino acids were _LOCATION_ . to clarify this discrepancy several independent clones were sequenced and the correct c terminus agreed with the deduced sequence of . sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame of nucleotides encoding for amino acid residues . the first _PROTEIN_ triplet which is nucleotides away from the end of was assigned as the translational start point because the sequence around the met codon matches the consensus sequence for the start codon of plant genes . a untranslated region of nucleotides downstream of the translation stop codon is present in the cdna sequence . the deduced amino acid sequence of was aligned with other satases from arabidopsis . the homology with the other satases is high throughout the central region . the phylogenetic tree indicates that is closely related to and both are separated from other satases forming a unique group different from those characterized previously . the functional identity of the isolated cdna together with was confirmed by successful complementation with an e. coli cys auxotrophic mutant lacking an endogenous satase activity . bacterial _PROTEIN_ vectors and carrying the coding regions of and under the transcriptional control of a lacz promoter of were constructed . e. coli transformed with these vectors was able to grow on minimal medium without cys in a similar manner as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ watermelon satase whereas e. coli transformed with an empty vector could not grow without supplementation of cys . this indicates the authenticity of and encoding the functional satase . using purified recombinant proteins the catalytic and regulatory properties of and were investigated . the cdnas were inserted in frame downstream from the male gene of e. coli which encodes a maltose binding protein . with this system the purified proteins of and were obtained by the cleavage of the maltose binding protein with _PROTEIN_ xa . the recombinant proteins were visualized on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gel as the expected kd and kd recombinant proteins in the soluble fraction . the km values for and were determined by oas formation and detected by hplc . the km values of these two satases for l ser and acetyl coa were much higher than those of the three previously reported _METHOD_ indicating low catalytic efficiencies of and for both substrates . kinetic constants of recombinant arabidopsis serat proteins the feedback inhibition by l cys on satase reaction was analyzed using purified recombinant proteins . the activity of was inhibited by l cys in a non competitive manner to l ser and in a competitive manner to acetyl coa with ki values of and respectively . the concentration for inhibition was being similar to spinach satase and watermelon satase . in contrast to was insensitive to feedback inhibition by l cys . the subcellular localization of and was determined in arabidopsis cells using fusion proteins of green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ with the n terminal peptides of these proteins . the n terminal regions of and were translationally fused to _METHOD_ respectively . these fusion genes were introduced into arabidopsis leaves by particle bombardment . as controls we used fusions to the n terminus of _METHOD_ with the transit peptide of pea rubisco small subunit and the transit peptide of arabidopsis ser hydroxymethyl transferase for _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and mitochondrial localization respectively . results in figure e and f indicated the _LOCATION_ localization of the _METHOD_ fusion proteins with two proteins indicating both and are localized in _LOCATION_ . these localizations were independently confirmed by particle bombardment of tobacco leaves . the cell type specific _PROTEIN_ of serat genes was studied in transgenic arabidopsis plants transformed with fusion gene constructs of the serat gene promoters and _METHOD_ gene . for each construct three to six independent transgenic lines were analyzed with _METHOD_ confocal microscopy . figure shows _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis lines transformed with the five serat promoter _METHOD_ constructs . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with all serat genes was generally found in the vascular tissues of leaves and roots preferentially in the phloem . a relatively weak _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was also observed in all photosynthetic tissues such as leaf mesophyll cells . in addition _METHOD_ could be seen in the calyx of flowers and the cortex in transverse sections of mature root . the _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ in root epidermis and cotyledons root hair and the calyx of flowers was found with and . with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was visualized in nascent roots . the mrna abundance of the serat genes was examined by northern blotting of rna from week old leaves . a high level of _PROTEIN_ was observed for and . in contrast the _PROTEIN_ of and was low suggesting distinct _PROTEIN_ patterns among the serat genes . because of the low _PROTEIN_ of and further analysis was conducted with the more sensitive method of real time quantitative pcr . and _PROTEIN_ higher amounts of mrna compared with and consistent with the results of northern blotting . among them was the dominant form in most tissues examined followed by and . each gene exhibited distinct _PROTEIN_ patterns during plant development . and showed a similar pattern with an increase in _PROTEIN_ at the vegetative stage . during the reproductive phase the _PROTEIN_ levels of both genes were significantly reduced . showed a different pattern in which the _PROTEIN_ increased over the first weeks of growth then _PROTEIN_ after weeks to a lower level than at the start of the experiment . _PROTEIN_ increased after weeks and reached a maximum value after weeks . interestingly and had similar _PROTEIN_ patterns but were distinctly different from other genes showing _PROTEIN_ at low levels in young stages and increased _PROTEIN_ at the _PROTEIN_ stage after weeks . _PROTEIN_ of each serat gene was further analyzed under the stress conditions of sulfur nutritional deficiency and cadmium exposure . remarkably under sulfur deficient conditions the mrna levels of the three genes and did not change in both roots and shoots . _PROTEIN_ increased fold at h only in the roots . in contrast _PROTEIN_ increased at h and h in both the roots and shoots indicating that may play a specific role under conditions of sulfur deficiency . in the roots of plants treated with cd _PROTEIN_ of all the genes increased except for . notably _PROTEIN_ was increased in the roots and in the shoots by cd treatment . in contrast _PROTEIN_ of the other serat genes did not increase in the shoots .
