the chloroplast contains many iron sulfur proteins for the processes of photosynthesis and nitrogen and s assimilation . although isolated chloroplasts are known to be able to synthesize their own fe s clusters the machinery involved is largely unknown . recently a cysteine desulfurase was reported in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ that likely provides the s for fe s clusters . here we describe an additional putative component of the _LOCATION_ fe s cluster assembly machinery in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ which has homology to bacterial isca and sufa proteins that have a scaffold function during fe s cluster formation . _PROTEIN_ mrna was shown to be _PROTEIN_ in all tissues tested with higher _PROTEIN_ level in green photosynthetic tissues . the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ was confirmed by green _METHOD_ protein fusions in vitro import and immunoblotting experiments . _PROTEIN_ was cloned and purified after _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli . addition of _PROTEIN_ significantly enhanced _PROTEIN_ mediated in vitro reconstitution of the cluster in apo ferredoxin . during incubation with _PROTEIN_ in a reconstitution mix _PROTEIN_ was shown to acquire a transient fe s cluster . the fe s cluster could subsequently be transferred by _PROTEIN_ to apo ferredoxin . we propose that the _PROTEIN_ protein serves as a scaffold in chloroplast fe s cluster assembly .
in earlier studies the nifs like protein _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis was shown to have cys desulfurase activity and to be located in the chloroplast . to identify another arabidopsis protein that might be involved in fe s cluster formation in _LOCATION_ a database search was performed to identify homologs of the cyanobacterial synechocystis pcc isca proteins . blast searches in the munich information center for protein sequences and the arabidopsis information resource databases revealed the presence of one isca like protein . targetp predictions suggest that this protein is a chloroplast protein with a amino acid long chloroplast transit sequence . the corresponding gene was named _PROTEIN_ and its cdna was cloned using reverse transcription pcr . alignment of the _PROTEIN_ primary sequence with isca and sufa like proteins from cyanobacteria and e. coli reveals the presence of three conserved cys residues including the characteristic motif cxc and a conserved asp in the c terminal region . these residues are conserved among all isca type proteins from prokaryotic and eukaryotic _METHOD_ . in addition to the three cys conserved in all isca type proteins _PROTEIN_ contains two other cys at residues and which are also present in cyanobacterial from synechocystis pcc . _PROTEIN_ exhibits higher sequence similarity to from synechocystis pcc and isca from e. coli compared to the mitochondrial isca like protein from arabidopsis and sufa from e. coli . consequently in a phylogenetic analysis _PROTEIN_ was grouped with cyanobacterial and e. coli isca separate from e. coli sufa and the arabidopsis mitochondrial nifa like protein . the _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ pattern in different tissues was analyzed using rna blot analysis . ten _METHOD_ of total rna extracted from roots _METHOD_ leaves and flowers was electrophoresed and ethidium bromide staining was used to verify equal loading . northern blot analysis reveals that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in all tested tissues with higher _PROTEIN_ level in green photosynthetic tissues _METHOD_ than non green tissues . the targetp program predicted a chloroplast localization of _PROTEIN_ and a cleavable transit sequence of amino acids . to examine the subcellular localization we constructed fusions with the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ was fused to the coding region for the predicted chloroplast transit sequence of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and to the full length isca including its transit sequence _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ alone _PROTEIN_ from the same constitutive promoter was used as a control . the localization in cells was analyzed using confocal laser microscopy . _METHOD_ corresponding to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ without a transit sequence was excluded from the chloroplasts as expected . by contrast green _METHOD_ from tp isca _METHOD_ was localized to the chloroplast stroma as indicated by the overlay of green _METHOD_ and red _METHOD_ . because chloroplast transit sequences effectively mediate translocation of a passenger protein across the envelope this is the expected location for a transit sequence fusion . interestingly green _METHOD_ from the full length _PROTEIN_ coupled to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was localized to discrete locations in the chloroplast stroma which may be indicative of the inclusion in discretely localized complexes . to investigate the chloroplast localization of _PROTEIN_ by an alternative method and to determine the size of the mature _PROTEIN_ protein in _LOCATION_ we performed an in vitro chloroplast uptake experiment . radiolabeled precursor protein was produced by in vitro transcription of the cloned cdna and subsequent translation of the synthetic mrna in the presence of met . the translation reaction resulted in a radiolabeled protein band with a size expected for the precursor . in addition to the precursor two translation products with a size smaller than the expected mature protein were present that may result from initiation at either of the two downstream aug codons corresponding to residues and . the translation mixture including the precursor was incubated with purified intact chloroplasts in the light and in the presence of _PROTEIN_ . after import and treatment with protease the chloroplasts were recovered and proteins were analyzed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the e. coli _PROTEIN_ recombinant mature _PROTEIN_ was electrophoresed in the same gel to allow a direct comparison of the molecular _METHOD_ with the imported protein . chloroplasts incubated with the precursor encoded by _PROTEIN_ and treated with protease accumulated a protein of about kd in size that has the same electrophoretic mobility as the purified recombinant mature protein . quantitation of the precursor and the mature bands indicated that of the added _PROTEIN_ precursor was imported in this assay which was comparable to the plastocyanin control . we conclude that the _PROTEIN_ precursor contains _LOCATION_ targeting information and that the protein is active in the chloroplast . the recombinant protein purified from e. coli corresponds in size to the imported mature _PROTEIN_ . to analyze localization and _PROTEIN_ levels in arabidopsis plants we raised an antibody that was used in immunoblots to analyze the presence of _PROTEIN_ in total leaf homogenate and chloroplast stroma fractions . the antibody recognized a band corresponding to the size of mature _PROTEIN_ in total homogenate and isolated stroma confirming the stromal localization of _PROTEIN_ . the mobility of the detected _PROTEIN_ protein band in plant fractions is the same as that of purified recombinant _PROTEIN_ . control experiments showed that these bands were not detected with preimmune serum . based on comparisons of the _PROTEIN_ staining intensities in stromal fractions and purified protein we estimate the abundance of _PROTEIN_ in stroma to be approximately to of protein which is slightly lower than the measured abundance of _PROTEIN_ . to investigate the oligomeric state of _PROTEIN_ in the stroma a gel filtration experiment was performed using a high resolution column and detection of _PROTEIN_ using immunoblotting . approximately of the stromal isca was eluted in a single peak at high molecular _METHOD_ . in addition a smaller amount of isca was eluted as a dimer . this result indicates that _PROTEIN_ present in stroma interacts with other proteins in vivo and may form a transient complex with them . interestingly a fraction of _PROTEIN_ was also detected in a complex of approximately kd and coelution of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was confirmed by gel filtration . the coding sequence for mature _PROTEIN_ was cloned into the _PROTEIN_ vector and the mature sized protein was _PROTEIN_ in codon e. coli cells . three hours after induction with isopropyl d thiogalactopyranoside a protein with a molecular _METHOD_ of about kd accumulated to about to of the soluble protein as shown by _METHOD_ brilliant blue staining . this molecular _METHOD_ is in agreement with the molecular _METHOD_ calculated from the dna sequence . soluble isca was purified using cation exchange chromatography and a gel filtration step . the protein was eluted from the calibrated gel filtration column with an apparent molecular _METHOD_ of kd suggesting that the protein is purified as a tetramer . n terminal sequencing by edmann degradation yielded the sequence rnrlsv corresponding to the predicted n terminal sequence of mature _PROTEIN_ . the pure _PROTEIN_ protein was colorless indicating it did not contain an fe s cluster while in e. coli . to study the role of _PROTEIN_ in fe s cluster formation an in vitro reconstitution assay was developed . in this assay apo fd was reconstituted to the holo form by acquiring an fe s cluster which was synthesized in vitro from cys s and a ferrous fe salt . holo fd was separated from apo fd and other proteins and quantified by hplc using an ion exchange column . the activity of _PROTEIN_ proved to be sufficient and required for the fe s cluster formation in fd . however other proteins may promote the efficiency of _PROTEIN_ mediated holo fd formation in a plant cell . in the presence of all necessary substrates for fe s cluster formation except _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ alone did not show any reconstitution activity . however preincubation of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ significantly increased subsequent fd reconstitution activity compared to that shown by _PROTEIN_ alone . the observed modest increase in reconstitution activity was a first indication of a possible role of _PROTEIN_ in fe s cluster formation . the stimulation of _PROTEIN_ dependent fd reconstitution activity by _PROTEIN_ suggested possible interactions between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the fe s cluster formation where _PROTEIN_ may be a scaffold for cluster assembly and an intermediate in fe s insertion . to investigate this possibility in more detail _PROTEIN_ was incubated with _PROTEIN_ in reconstitution buffer _PROTEIN_ for min and then applied to a gel filtration column . as controls apo _PROTEIN_ incubated in gel filtration buffer or in reconstitution buffer as well as _PROTEIN_ alone were incubated and run through the same column . proteins were detected by and nm . purified untreated apo _PROTEIN_ eluted from the column in a peak with a retention time expected for the tetramer but a shoulder was present suggesting the existence of lower molecular _METHOD_ isca species . incubation of apoisca with dtt containing buffer resulted in _PROTEIN_ the dimeric form of the protein . no absorbance was detected at nm indicating the absence of fe s clusters in the apo isca fractions . as shown in figure incubation of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ resulted in two major peaks corresponding to _PROTEIN_ and a _PROTEIN_ dimer according to its calculated molecular _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ indicated that the peak of _PROTEIN_ eluted at min and the dimeric _PROTEIN_ at min . interestingly the peak corresponding to reconstituted dimeric _PROTEIN_ could also be detected by suggesting the presence of an fe s cluster . apo _PROTEIN_ and reconstituted dimeric _PROTEIN_ were collected from gel filtration runs and their absorption spectra were measured . unreconstituted _PROTEIN_ showed only one peak at nm characteristic for aromatic residues in proteins . reconstituted _PROTEIN_ however showed extra maxima at nm nm and nm indicative of a cluster . in a typical cluster absorption from nm to nm is attributed to the vibration between fe and bridging inorganic s . the presence of fe in _PROTEIN_ was determined chemically using spinach holo fd as control which contains one cluster per protein . we measured fe/protein for spinach holo fd . reconstituted _PROTEIN_ contained fe/dimer while no fe was detected in the apo form . because the reconstituted fraction obtained after incubation with _PROTEIN_ still may contain some inactive apo _PROTEIN_ a number slightly lower than two is expected for the number of fe _METHOD_ . these data indicate that the isolated and reduced _PROTEIN_ is a clusterless apo protein while the reconstituted dimer may contain a cluster . the fe s cluster formed in isca is stable since treatment with fe chelator or overnight incubation at did not induce destruction of the fe s cluster as indicated by the reconstitution efficiency . as _PROTEIN_ appeared to have an fe s cluster the potential transfer of the fe s cluster to apo fd was investigated . both apo and holo _PROTEIN_ were collected from the gel filtration column and incubated with of apo fd in the presence of mm dtt at for min . as controls holo fd alone and holo isca alone were incubated . incubation mixtures were used for holo fd analysis by hplc . as shown in figure the apo _PROTEIN_ fraction did not lead to any formation of holo fd while of apo fd was reconstituted to holo fd by acquiring an fe s cluster from the dimeric holo _PROTEIN_ . to test if the amount of holo fd formation depends on the amount of holo isca various amounts of holo isca were incubated with apo fd for min and the amount of holo fd was assayed . the amount of holo fd formed increased with increasing the amount of holo isca . importantly in the same condition when holo isca was incubated with apo fd in the presence of mm edta reconstitution was still observed with activity of the reaction without edta indicating direct transfer from isca to apo fd . thus it is proposed that holo _PROTEIN_ can be formed from apo _PROTEIN_ by acquisition of a transient fe s cluster which it can subsequently deliver to apo fd . this suggests a role for _PROTEIN_ as a scaffold during fe s cluster formation in _LOCATION_ and in transfer of the formed cluster to apo fe s proteins .
