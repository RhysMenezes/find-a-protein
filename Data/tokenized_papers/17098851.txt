seventeen loci encode proteins of the preprotein and amino acid transporter family in arabidopsis . some of these genes have arisen from recent duplications and are not in annotated duplicated regions of the arabidopsis genome . in comparison to a number of other eukaryotic _METHOD_ this family of proteins has greatly expanded in plants with loci in rice . most of the arabidopsis and rice genes are orthologous indicating expansion of this family before monocot and dicot divergence . in vitro protein uptake assays in vivo green _METHOD_ protein tagging and immunological analyses of selected proteins determined either mitochondrial or _LOCATION_ localization for and six proteins respectively . the protein encoded by _GENE_ is targeted to both mitochondria and chloroplasts and to our knowledge is the first _LOCATION_ protein reported to be targeted to mitochondria and chloroplasts . three genes encoded translocase of the inner mitochondrial _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ like proteins three _PROTEIN_ like proteins and three outer envelope like proteins in arabidopsis . the identity of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ like proteins is most likely a protein encoded by _GENE_ based on phylogenetic analysis subcellular localization and complementation of a yeast mutant and coexpression analysis . the lack of a preprotein and amino acid transporter domain in some proteins localization in mitochondria _LOCATION_ or both variation in gene structure and the differences in _PROTEIN_ profiles indicate that the function of this family has diverged in plants beyond roles in protein translocation .
a query of the most recent genome annotation for arabidopsis searched with the text term _PROTEIN_ yields distinct loci . this represents a large increase in family size in comparison to yeast where single genes encode the _PROTEIN_ and proteins that define this family . the predicted proteins range in size from in _PROTEIN_ to amino acids in the protein encoded by _GENE_ . transmembrane spanning regions were analyzed using the dense alignment surface transmembrane predictor and compared to previously defined transmembrane regions in yeast _PROTEIN_ and and the proposed transmembrane structure of pea _PROTEIN_ . although this family of proteins is defined as having four transmembrane regions in the aramemnon database four transmembrane regions were only predicted for five of the proteins using the consensus prediction of nine predictors . some of these proteins were not even defined as _LOCATION_ proteins . however because many predictors also fail to predict four transmembrane regions in the corresponding yeast proteins and even for _PROTEIN_ where detailed investigation strongly supports four transmembrane regions only two or three are predicted thus it is likely that more than five of the proteins have four transmembrane regions . a prat domain previously used to define this family was present in seven of the arabidopsis predicted proteins whereas four contained a degenerate prat domain with one additional amino acid spacing or with one of the consensus amino acids missing . an examination of the rice genome yields a similar picture with genes encoding proteins in this family . phylogenetic analysis of the predicted arabidopsis proteins with yeast _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from pea is shown in figure . three genes previously designated as encoding _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ form a distinct group which is close to yeast _PROTEIN_ and range in size from amino acids in _PROTEIN_ to amino acids in _PROTEIN_ . a clearly distinct grouping previously designated _PROTEIN_ can also be observed with yeast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . three predicted proteins branch with pea _PROTEIN_ with sequence identity varying from to . these three groupings are _PROTEIN_ if the rice sequences are included . the situation with _PROTEIN_ is not as clear if only proteins of arabidopsis are analyzed _PROTEIN_ of yeast branches with three proteins namely _GENE_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ but this grouping is not supported by bootstrapping . if the member family of proteins from rice is included in the analysis yeast _PROTEIN_ clusters with the two proteins encoded by _GENE_ and _GENE_ and a rice protein with some bootstrap support . therefore in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ is probably represented by _GENE_ and _GENE_ . it becomes apparent by the poor bootstrap support of the basal nodes of both trees that the relationship of the three defined groups mentioned above and the residual proteins can not be resolved . some genes display very high protein sequence identity indicating they have likely arisen from recent duplications . _GENE_ and _GENE_ encode predicted proteins with identity but are not located on segments of chromosomes previously annotated to be duplicated . the coding and untranslated regions are identical and are approximately bp upstream of the annotated transcriptional start site . this high level of _LOCATION_ acid sequence identity is _PROTEIN_ for approximately kb until and _GENE_ . _GENE_ and _GENE_ encode predicted proteins that display sequence identity and _GENE_ and _GENE_ encode predicted proteins that display sequence identity . the former pair as well as _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ and _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ which display protein identity are located in previously annotated duplicated regions of the arabidopsis genome . analysis of the gene structures reveals that the genes defined as _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ contain no introns in the coding regions but for the other members the number of introns varies from one in the coding region to six leading to quite variable gene structures . to determine whether the expansion of this family of proteins is restricted to arabidopsis plants or has taken place in other eukaryotic lineages we examined the number of genes encoding mitochondrial protein import components in a variety of _METHOD_ . a bioinformatic approach was undertaken to identify homologs to the yeast protein import machinery in arabidopsis rice neurospora crassa homo sapiens mus musculus rattus norvegicus drosophila melanogaster and caenorhabditis elegans . the results were entered into a relational database that can be accessed at http //www.plantenergy.uwa.edu.au/mpric . homologs to the majority of yeast import components were identified in all _METHOD_ with the exception of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . whereas the genomes of yeast and n. crassa encode only a single isoform of each component _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ plant and animal genomes often encode the import components in small multiple gene families . this is particularly evident for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . of particular interest is the large size of the _PROTEIN_ family in both arabidopsis and rice and the relatively large number of genes encoding members of this family that can not be assigned or whose function is unknown indicating that these gene families have undergone extensive expansion in plants . examination of the prat family of proteins in rice indicates that there are orthologous genes for all those found in arabidopsis indicating that this family of proteins diverged before the split of the monocot/dicot lineages . the number of genes in each grouping differs indicating duplication after lineage divergence but strongly suggesting that the large size of this family of proteins is a general feature of _METHOD_ . rice genes encoded by and do not appear to have orthologs in arabidopsis . examination of the protein alignment indicates that they are not highly conserved in the region containing the prat domain and thus they may represent pseudogenes or incorrect annotations . because proteins encoded by different members of this family have been reported in chloroplasts and mitochondria we determined the subcellular localization of all the encoded proteins in vitro using protein uptake assays into isolated mitochondria and chloroplasts and in vivo using green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagging . as controls we used the small subunit of rubisco for in vitro chloroplast import and the maize phosphate translocator and adenine nucleotide translocator for in vitro mitochondrial import because this family of proteins is imported via the carrier import pathway . for in vivo _METHOD_ localization we used the red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fused to the targeting signal for mitochondrial alternative oxidase _METHOD_ or fused to the targeting signal of rbcs _METHOD_ . arabidopsis suspension cells were transiently transformed with a prat protein fused to _METHOD_ and aox _METHOD_ or rbcs _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ was collected at the appropriate wavelength and images were merged to determine the location of the prat _METHOD_ fusion protein . mitochondrial localization was defined for the three proteins belonging to the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ families using both in vitro uptake assays and in vivo _METHOD_ localization of proteins . in vitro incubation of radiolabeled proteins with purified mitochondria resulted in a protease protected band . this band was either abolished or diminished in intensity if the ionophore valinomycin was added to the import reaction prior to commencement . in yeast _PROTEIN_ and are imported via the carrier import pathway where stage ii or iiia intermediates are bound to the import receptor or translocated through the _PROTEIN_ pore respectively . such intermediates are resistant to protease digestion even in the absence of a _LOCATION_ potential because they have not yet come into interaction with the inner _LOCATION_ . thus to verify that the protease protected protein is inserted into the inner _LOCATION_ we ruptured the outer _LOCATION_ to allow access of added protease to the inner _LOCATION_ . inner _LOCATION_ proteins are still protected from added protease or produce inner _LOCATION_ protected fragments whereas import intermediates are digested . treatment of outer _LOCATION_ ruptured mitochondria with protease resulted in a protease protected band that was absent if valinomycin was present in the import assay . the exception was _PROTEIN_ where a protease protected band was only observed with intact mitochondria . because this protein contains only amino acids it is possible that the lack of protection in outer _LOCATION_ ruptured mitochondria is due to the _PROTEIN_ that it does not have the four transmembrane spanning regions typical of this family the protein ends in the middle of the region where the fourth transmembrane region is predicted for yeast _PROTEIN_ . mitochondrial localization was confirmed for all _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins because linking _METHOD_ to the c terminus yielded a mitochondrial pattern as determined by colocalization of the _METHOD_ signal with aox _METHOD_ . some differences were observed with the _METHOD_ signal whereas _PROTEIN_ yielded a typical mitochondrial pattern of numerous small particles the _METHOD_ pattern in other constructs although concentrated in small particles was more intense and appeared to encompass a greater surface area of the cell . this may be due to the _PROTEIN_ that the _METHOD_ moiety may in some cases still remain outside the _LOCATION_ as for _PROTEIN_ the c terminus portion is in the outer _LOCATION_ accessible by externally added protease . furthermore the ability of _METHOD_ to dimerize may contribute to this altered mitochondrial pattern . however in all cases the _METHOD_ pattern overlapped with the aox _METHOD_ pattern . furthermore there was no evidence of import into purified chloroplasts there were no protease protected products detected and binding appeared to be very low . similar analysis was carried out with the proteins encoded by the remaining genes . because _GENE_ and _GENE_ are identical only one cdna was used in the analysis . mitochondrial localization was defined for the proteins encoded by _GENE_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ . all three proteins yielded a typical mitochondrial pattern when tagged with _METHOD_ and there was no protease protection upon incubation with chloroplasts . for _GENE_ and _GENE_ it was concluded that the proteins were located in the mitochondrial inner _LOCATION_ based on the _PROTEIN_ that a distinct inner _LOCATION_ protease protected band was observed with outer _LOCATION_ ruptured mitochondria . _GENE_ displayed some unusual features upon import into mitochondria . incubation of the kd protein with mitochondria and protease treatment produced an additional product with an apparent molecular _METHOD_ of kd . an identical pattern was observed when valinomycin was present in the import assay and when the outer _LOCATION_ was removed before protease treatment . notably the addition of valinomycin and rupture of the outer _LOCATION_ prior to protease treatment resulted in complete digestion . thus the similarity in the protected fragments in the presence and absence of valinomycin may be due to the _PROTEIN_ that in the presence of valinomycin insertion into the outer _LOCATION_ results in the same region being protected as insertion into the inner _LOCATION_ in the absence of valinomycin . the _PROTEIN_ like proteins encoded by _GENE_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ were designated as targeted to chloroplasts . this was based on the _PROTEIN_ that the pattern of _METHOD_ observed was identical to rbcs _METHOD_ . in the case of _GENE_ _LOCATION_ targeting only took place when _METHOD_ was fused to the n terminal region of the encoded protein . in comparison to the mitochondrial pattern in these cells the oval shaped _METHOD_ _METHOD_ spots were larger and fewer in number . additionally none of these proteins were imported into mitochondria based on the observation that no protease protected products were observed under any conditions . import into isolated chloroplasts yielded protected products for _GENE_ and _GENE_ notably the latter had an apparent molecular _METHOD_ of kd compared to the precursor protein of kd . the protein encoded by _GENE_ did not yield protease protected products upon incubation with chloroplasts . in _PROTEIN_ the protein did not even bind to chloroplasts . in vitro targeting assays did not yield definitive subcellular localization with the proteins encoded by _GENE_ and _GENE_ . with isolated mitochondria protease protected products were consistently detected even in the presence of valinomycin . notably both proteins are digested to completion upon protease treatment with outer _LOCATION_ ruptured mitochondria . this may indicate that the proteins were inserted into the outer _LOCATION_ . on the other hand incubation with isolated chloroplasts also resulted in protease protection indicating successful import _LOCATION_ . however for both organelles it can not be excluded that the observed protease protection results from unspecific binding of the proteins on the surface of the organelles . with _METHOD_ targeting two patterns were evident for _GENE_ clear _LOCATION_ localization was evident whereas for _GENE_ mitochondrial localization was concluded based on colocalization with aox _METHOD_ . to verify the subcellular localization of the proteins encoded by _GENE_ and _GENE_ antibodies were raised against the overexpressed protein encoded by _GENE_ . because this protein and the protein encoded by _GENE_ display identity the antibody cross reacts with both proteins but not with a variety of other overexpressed prat proteins . the protein encoded by _GENE_ has a small but detectable higher apparent molecular _METHOD_ than that encoded by _GENE_ . western blot analyses with antibodies raised against the protein encoded by _GENE_ detect a prominent band in chloroplasts and a weaker band with a slightly higher molecular _METHOD_ . probing mitochondria with this antibody only detects the higher band . probing the mitochondrial fraction with antibodies to other chloroplast proteins such as _PROTEIN_ of chloroplasts and _PROTEIN_ reveals no cross reaction indicating no significant contamination of purified mitochondria with chloroplasts . thus given that only the upper band is detected and that there is no significant contamination it was concluded that the protein encoded by _GENE_ was located in mitochondria and chloroplasts and the protein encoded by _GENE_ was located in chloroplasts . subcellular localization of the protein encoded by _GENE_ could not be defined by in vivo and in vitro targeting studies . c terminal _METHOD_ tagging did not yield a pattern that corresponded to either mitochondrial or _LOCATION_ localization n terminal _METHOD_ tagging indicated _LOCATION_ localization a pattern frequently observed with _METHOD_ if it is not targeted to any localization in the cell . utilization of an _METHOD_ peroxisomal targeted protein indicated that the protein was not targeted to _LOCATION_ . western blot analysis of isolated chloroplasts and mitochondria using an antibody raised against the _GENE_ protein yielded a strong band in the chloroplast fraction strongly suggesting a chloroplastidic location for this protein . the antibody raised against _GENE_ did not recognize the protein encoded by _GENE_ which encodes for a identical protein . this protein however showed a clear _LOCATION_ pattern when tagged with c terminal _METHOD_ . because _PROTEIN_ is an essential protein in yeast and the identity of the ortholog was unclear in arabidopsis the ability of various prat proteins imported into isolated mitochondria to complement a yeast mutant for lacking a functional _PROTEIN_ protein was tested . the endogenous yeast _PROTEIN_ gene was placed under the gal promoter so that its _PROTEIN_ was dependent on the presence of gal in the growth medium . the ability of three arabidopsis genes to complement this strain was tested _GENE_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ . culturing of yeast on gal free medium resulted in only _GENE_ supporting growth . thus only _GENE_ could support a _PROTEIN_ function under the conditions tested . previously we have shown that the arabidopsis orthologs for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ can also complement yeast mutants . thus it appears that the function of these translocases is well conserved across wide phylogenetic gaps and suggests that _GENE_ and _GENE_ may not play roles in protein transport . because this family of genes was initially defined in yeast as being essential for the process of protein import into mitochondria and _PROTEIN_ is proposed to be involved in the import of _PROTEIN_ a into chloroplasts we examined the transcript abundance of all members of this family in comparison to transcripts encoding components of the mitochondrial chloroplast and _LOCATION_ protein import apparatus . we also included several other metabolic components whose subcellular localization has been defined . we used quantitative reverse transcription pcr analysis to examine transcript abundance over development in leaves from weeks to weeks for genes . a distinct pattern emerged when analyzed using self organizing map analysis . for a number of genes encoding components defined as being located in chloroplasts transcript abundance was initially high after which it declined steadily . this pattern was also observed with genes encoding the p subunit of gly decarboxylase and hydroxypyruvate reductase located in mitochondria and _LOCATION_ respectively and playing a well characterized role in the photorespiratory cycle . three genes of the prat family _GENE_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ exhibited a similar pattern . for _GENE_ and _GENE_ this is in agreement with chloroplastidic location as defined above . also for the protein encoded by _GENE_ a chloroplastidic _PROTEIN_ pattern is consistent with immunological analysis . cluster groups and were dominated by genes encoding mitochondrial components and yet contained the gene _GENE_ of the prat family encoding a protein defined as having a chloroplast location . notably the undefined prat proteins encoded by _GENE_ and _GENE_ defined as mitochondrial by in vitro and in vivo targeting studies displayed a pattern of _PROTEIN_ consistent with mitochondrial location . so does the protein encoded by _GENE_ this further supports dual localization for the protein . according to available public microarray data _GENE_ is not _PROTEIN_ in rosette leaves analysis of transcript abundance by qrt pcr is in agreement with this where _PROTEIN_ was extremely low or not detectable . due to the sequence identity between _GENE_ and _GENE_ it was not possible to determine the _PROTEIN_ of either unambiguously .
blast and psi blast _METHOD_ were used to search protein databases for proteins displaying significant homology to import components characterized in yeast . hits from this search with expectation values were then used to query yeast protein databases . if the hit with the greatest confidence in this search was the yeast import component sequence used in the initial search the protein was termed a putative protein import component . proteins were aligned using clustalx . phylogenetic trees were constructed with the program _PROTEIN_ . only the conserved region of the proteins around the prat domain was used in the phylogenic analyses . data were bootstrap resampled times . gene structures were obtained from tair and three individual cdna clones were sequenced . in vitro protein import assays into isolated mitochondria from arabidopsis were carried out as previously described . outer _LOCATION_ ruptured mitochondria were prepared by osmotic shock . in vitro protein import assays into isolated chloroplasts from pea were carried out as previously outlined . _METHOD_ targeting was carried out by cloning _METHOD_ in frame to the n or c terminus of the cdna clone and transformation of arabidopsis suspension cells by biolistic transformation . _METHOD_ was fused to the targeting signal of soybean aox _METHOD_ and pea rbcs _METHOD_ as mitochondrial and _LOCATION_ controls respectively . _METHOD_ patterns were obtained h after transformation by visualization under an olympus _METHOD_ microscope and imaged using cell imaging software . antibodies were raised in rabbit against recombinant protein encoded by _GENE_ and _GENE_ respectively . proteins with a his tag located on the c terminus were _PROTEIN_ and purified on a nickel nitrilotriacetic acid column . chloroplasts from d old arabidopsis plants grown on one half strength murashige and skoog medium were isolated as described by citation . mitochondria from week old plants were isolated according to citation . specificity of the antibodies was tested on different recombinant proteins of the prat protein family of arabidopsis . the yeast strain _PROTEIN_ under the control of the gal promoter _PROTEIN_ has been described previously . because _PROTEIN_ is a protein essential for yeast cell viability this strain requires gal in the medium for growth . for complementation analysis arabidopsis open reading frames _GENE_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ were cloned into the yeast vector pvt u which enables the _PROTEIN_ of cloned genes under the constitutive alcohol dehydrogenase promoter . obtained plasmids were transformed into the gal _PROTEIN_ yeast strain using the lithium acetate method . empty plasmid and the plasmid containing were transformed as controls . the ability of various proteins to substitute for was assessed on the selective medium lacking or containing gal . two independent transformants were analyzed for each transformation and gave identical results . qrt pcr was carried out on rna isolated from second rosette leaves at different times the initial time point labeled was when leaves just emerged and then and weeks after this time . at weeks the leaves were pale green or yellowing and in an advanced stage of senescence . qrt pcr was carried out as previously described with the gene listed . the _LOCATION_ acid sequences for and have been deposited previously in genbank with the accession numbers _GENE_ _GENE_ _GENE_ _GENE_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ . the genbank accession numbers for the remaining cdna sequences used in this study are as follows _GENE_ _GENE_ _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ _GENE_ _GENE_ _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ . the following materials are available in the online version of this article . supplemental figure . multiple sequence alignment of the predicted proteins of the prat family from arabidopsis and rice . supplemental figure . phylogenetic analysis and gene structure of genes encoding prat proteins from arabidopsis and rice . supplemental figure . _PROTEIN_ indicating the percentage identity and similarity of proteins encoded by the prat family of genes in arabidopsis and rice . supplemental table . abbreviations and full names for genes whose _PROTEIN_ patterns were analyzed in this study . the loci subcellular location of encoded protein and reference for _PROTEIN_ analysis are listed .
