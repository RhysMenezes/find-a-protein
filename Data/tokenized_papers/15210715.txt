_PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ is found in cyanobacteria and chloroplasts of photosynthetic eukaryotes where it is essential for the formation of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ is closely related to the phage shock protein a a bacterial protein induced under diverse stress conditions . _PROTEIN_ proteins differ from pspa by an additional c terminal domain that is required for _PROTEIN_ function in _LOCATION_ biogenesis . we show here that in cyanobacteria green algae and vascular plants _PROTEIN_ is part of a high molecular _METHOD_ complex . the complex is formed by multiple copies of _PROTEIN_ and complex formation involves interaction of the central helical domain that is common to _PROTEIN_ as well as to pspa proteins . in chloroplasts of vascular plants the _PROTEIN_ complex can be visualized by green _METHOD_ protein fusion in discrete locations at the inner envelope . green _METHOD_ protein fusion analysis furthermore revealed that complex formation is important for proper positioning of _PROTEIN_ at the inner envelope of chloroplasts .
cross linking of inner envelope vesicles from envelope vesicles derived from pea chloroplasts were cross linked with and proteins were subsequently separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ protein was detected by western blot analysis using an antibody raised against the full length protein from pea . as shown previously the monomeric _PROTEIN_ can be detected as a band of kda in accordance with its deduced molecular _METHOD_ . a second band of about kda can be observed frequently after long exposure to reducing conditions and was identified previously as _PROTEIN_ by protein sequencing . the chemical alteration that causes the difference in the running behavior is not known . incubation of inner envelope vesicles with created several immunoreactive bands of higher molecular _METHOD_ . a characteristic band pattern was observed repeatedly in all our experiments indicating the formation of specific cross link products . a band of about kda became visible early on during the cross linking reaction and it remained the most prominent immunoreactive band even after prolonged incubation with . the reaction created two more immunoreactive bands of about and well over kda . a similar pattern was observed with chloroplasts of other vascular plants and with a different cross linker supporting the specificity of the cross link reaction . these results were the first indication that _PROTEIN_ is in close proximity to other proteins to which it can be cross linked . the cross linking pattern suggests that _PROTEIN_ primarily _METHOD_ a homodimer or that it interacts with a protein of a very similar molecular _METHOD_ . from their size the higher molecular _METHOD_ products could well present tetramers and octamers of _PROTEIN_ . bn _PROTEIN_ analysis of cyanobacteria and chloroplast _PROTEIN_ investigate a potential complex formation by _PROTEIN_ we separated native protein complexes from arabidopsis chloroplasts by bn _PROTEIN_ . isolated chloroplasts were solubilized in dm and nonsolubilized proteins were removed by centrifugation . under these conditions most of the proteins were found in the supernatant including about of the _PROTEIN_ protein as determined by western blot analysis . the solubilized proteins and protein complexes were subsequently separated by bn _PROTEIN_ in the first and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the second dimension . western blot analysis of the second dimension revealed two distinct positions of the _PROTEIN_ protein . a minor part of _PROTEIN_ was found slightly below the first green band which contains the monomeric light harvesting chlorophyll binding protein and which corresponds to a size of about kda . this part of the _PROTEIN_ protein is therefore most likely monomeric . the major part of _PROTEIN_ was found clearly above the photosystem i complex corresponding to a size of more than kda indicating that most of the _PROTEIN_ is indeed present as a high molecular _METHOD_ complex . similar results were obtained for the _PROTEIN_ protein from pea tobacco or chlamydomonas . thus the organization of _PROTEIN_ in a high molecular _METHOD_ complex _METHOD_ common to vascular plants as well as green algae . we wanted to elucidate whether a similar organization of _PROTEIN_ can be found in cyanobacteria . therefore detergent solubilized _LOCATION_ proteins from synechocystis were separated by bn _PROTEIN_ in the first and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the second dimension . the proteins were subsequently analyzed by western blot with _PROTEIN_ against the pea protein which also recognizes _PROTEIN_ from synechocystis . the immunoblot showed very little monomeric _PROTEIN_ protein in synechocystis whereas most of the _PROTEIN_ was present in complexes of similar sizes compared with higher plants . it was shown recently that pspa from e. coli _METHOD_ a _PROTEIN_ like homomultimer of kda . our results suggest that a similar structure is also formed by _PROTEIN_ . bn _PROTEIN_ analysis of heterologously _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ elucidate whether the _PROTEIN_ complex is homo oligomeric we analyzed the organization of full length _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis that was heterologously _PROTEIN_ in e. coli . cells were disrupted and the _LOCATION_ fraction was recovered by centrifugation . the majority of the heterologously _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein was found in this fraction . the _LOCATION_ fraction was subsequently treated with dm and solubilized proteins were separated by bn _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as before . western blot analysis revealed that more than half of _PROTEIN_ was present as monomeric protein . nevertheless a significant amount was found in a high molecular _METHOD_ complex of approximately the same size as native _PROTEIN_ from chloroplasts . these results indicated that heterologously _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein alone _METHOD_ to be sufficient for complex formation and no further chloroplast proteins are required for this process . size exclusion chromatography of heterologously _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ analyze further the nature of the _PROTEIN_ complex we separated heterologously _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein by size exclusion chromatography . part of heterologously _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein is soluble under conditions where nondenaturing detergents such as dm or chaps are used in the preparation . we purified this soluble fraction of _PROTEIN_ by affinity chromatography on ni _PROTEIN_ under nondenaturing conditions . the eluate from ni _PROTEIN_ was nearly free from contamination by other proteins and was separated further by size exclusion chromatography on superose . the chromatogram displayed a major protein peak corresponding to a molecular _METHOD_ of about kda . western blot analysis identified _PROTEIN_ in this high molecular _METHOD_ peak confirming the results from the bn _PROTEIN_ analysis . the behavior of the heterologously _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein during size exclusion is identical to _PROTEIN_ purified from detergent solubilized chloroplasts providing confirmation that the heterologously _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ behaves like the native protein . to obtain a larger quantity of purified _PROTEIN_ for negative stain em analysis the protein was isolated from inclusion bodies under denaturing conditions and was subsequently renatured in a buffer that included guanidine hcl polyethylene glycol and sucrose . most of the _PROTEIN_ protein was soluble after renaturation and this fraction was then likewise analyzed by size exclusion chromatography . the chromatogram obtained from this fraction was very similar to the one from _PROTEIN_ purified under nondenaturing conditions . the _PROTEIN_ protein was again found predominantly in the peak corresponding to a molecular _METHOD_ of approximately kda . thus we concluded that the denaturing renaturing process did not interfere with the ability of _PROTEIN_ to form a high molecular _METHOD_ complex and the protein eluting in the peak fraction was used for em studies . analysis of purified _PROTEIN_ complex by negative staining _PROTEIN_ complex purified under nondenaturing conditions by size exclusion chromatography was analyzed by negative stain em after treatment with uranyl acetate . because of the limited amount of protein the sample yielded only very few particles . to obtain more data on the _PROTEIN_ particles we analyzed _PROTEIN_ complexes isolated under denaturing conditions which had been renatured and subsequently purified by size exclusion . these samples yielded a much larger set of particles . several different samples obtained from two separate purifications were analyzed to get an impression of the structure of the _PROTEIN_ complex . the majority of singular particles appeared _PROTEIN_ shaped with a darker area in the center and they were classified as top view onto the complex . other particles appeared tilted by in relation to the plane of the grid representing a side view on the complex . these particles were often found in stacks of two or more . we assume that this stacking is most likely the result of a higher complex concentration in this sample . in some rare cases particles could be found which were tilted at a less than angle . in these cases the hole in the middle of the complex became partially visible . to get a rough estimation of the size of the _PROTEIN_ complex the different dimensions of about single particles were measured . calculated from this measurements the _PROTEIN_ complex has a width of about and a height of about . the hole in the middle is estimated to be about trypsin digestion of inner envelope vesicles and overexpressed _PROTEIN_ had observed previously that treatment of inner envelope vesicles with trypsin resulted in the formation of a kda proteolytic fragment of _PROTEIN_ that remained fairly resistant to proteolysis . this fragment is about the same size as the _PROTEIN_ protein without its c terminal extension or as pspa from e. coli . we tested this assumption by raising an antibody against the last amino acids of the pea _PROTEIN_ protein . the antiserum recognized the full length _PROTEIN_ protein in untreated inner envelope . in contrast the kda peptide that remained after trypsin digestion was not recognized by this antibody . thus it is indeed the _PROTEIN_ specific c terminal extension that is cleaved from the _PROTEIN_ protein . these results are consistent with a hypothetical structure of the _PROTEIN_ where the n terminal pspa like domain is being protected from proteolysis by a tight complex formation whereas the c terminal extension is accessible to the protease . to test this possibility further we trypsin treated chloroplast proteins after solubilization with dm . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ analysis shows that under these conditions the n terminal pspa like domain of _PROTEIN_ is protected . when proteins were subsequently analyzed by bn _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ no monomeric _PROTEIN_ protein was visible whereas the kda proteolytic fragment was still present at the complex size . these results support the idea that complex formation depends on the n terminal pspa like domain of _PROTEIN_ and that it protects the _PROTEIN_ protein from trypsin digestion . accessibility to trypsin digestion furthermore indicates that the _PROTEIN_ specific c terminal extension is not buried within the complex . transient _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ that most of _PROTEIN_ is organized in a high molecular _METHOD_ complex raised the question of where this large complex is localized within the chloroplast . we transformed protoplasts from both tobacco and arabidopsis with _METHOD_ which contains the _PROTEIN_ gene of arabidopsis including its presequence as an n terminal fusion to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ under the camv promoter . as shown in fig . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein is targeted into the chloroplasts where it is found in many well defined spots arranged in a _PROTEIN_ like fashion . an overlay of the chlorophyll and the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signals clearly showed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ resides outside the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ system . this pattern is consistent with a location of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein either inside the inner envelope or close to the inner surface of the chloroplasts envelope . we further conclude that the distinct pattern of the _METHOD_ signal represents the _PROTEIN_ complexes . we took advantage of the _METHOD_ fusion approach to identify domains of _PROTEIN_ that are involved in complex formation . for this purpose two more _METHOD_ fusion protein constructs were made comprising only the pspa like domain of _PROTEIN_ without its c terminal extension _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and a construct where amino acid residues of the long alpha helical stretch inside the n terminal pspa like domain of the protein were removed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . these constructs were once more transformed into protoplasts from tobacco and arabidopsis . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein displayed the same distribution pattern as _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . indeed double transformations with both constructs into the same protoplast revealed the proteins in indistinguishable spots indicating that they are present in identical complexes . these results indicate that the n terminal pspa like domain of _PROTEIN_ is sufficient for complex formation . on the other hand no _PROTEIN_ like pattern was observed with _PROTEIN_ helix _METHOD_ . instead the _METHOD_ signal was distributed evenly throughout the chloroplasts as would be expected from a soluble stroma protein . thus disruption of the central helical part of the _PROTEIN_ proteins inhibits the localization of _PROTEIN_ to the inner envelope . bn _PROTEIN_ analysis of protoplasts transformed with _METHOD_ fusion support the _METHOD_ microscopy data further we isolated chloroplasts from protoplasts transformed with various _METHOD_ fusion constructs . proteins were separated by bn _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as before and analyzed by western blot . both the endogenous _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein were visible on the blot due their difference in molecular _METHOD_ . they both displayed a similar distribution between the low molecular _METHOD_ and the complex form . in contrast the _PROTEIN_ helix _METHOD_ protein was found exclusively as a monomeric protein . these findings together with the _METHOD_ microscopy data suggest that disruption of the n terminal helical structure in _PROTEIN_ abolishes complex formation and thereby affects the localization of _PROTEIN_ within the chloroplast whereas the _PROTEIN_ specific c terminus has no influence on either .

were used to obtain the full length _PROTEIN_ pcr product primers v forward and vm reverse were used to amplify the n terminal part of _PROTEIN_ . the pcr products were cloned into pol lp vector n
