plasmodesmal conductivity is regulated in part by callose turnover which is hypothesized to be determined by _PROTEIN_ synthase versus _PROTEIN_ activities . a proteomic analysis of an arabidopsis thaliana plasmodesmata rich fraction identified a _PROTEIN_ as present in this fraction . the protein encoded by the putative plasmodesmal associated protein gene termed _PROTEIN_ had previously been found to be a post translationally modified glycosylphosphatidylinositol lipid anchored protein . when fused to green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ in tobacco or nicotiana benthamiana epidermal cells this protein displays _METHOD_ patterns in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ system along the cell periphery and in a punctate pattern that co localizes with aniline blue stained callose present around the pd . _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization was verified by co localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ together with a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker n pyridinium dibromide in plasmolysed cells . in arabidopsis t dna insertion mutants that do not transcribe _PROTEIN_ functional studies showed that _METHOD_ cell to cell movement between epidermal cells is reduced and the conductivity coefficient of pd is lower . measurements of callose levels around pd after wounding revealed that callose accumulation in the mutant plants was higher . taken together we suggest that _PROTEIN_ is a pd associated _LOCATION_ protein involved in plasmodesmal callose degradation and functions in the gating of pd .
proteins in an a. thaliana pd enriched fraction were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ blue stained bands were cut in gel reduced alkylated and proteolysed overnight with trypsin and the tryptic peptides were resolved by reverse phase chromatography on a column . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was performed with ion trap _METHOD_ spectrometers operating in the positive mode using repetition of a full _METHOD_ scan followed by collision induced dissociation of the most dominant ion selected from the first _METHOD_ . the _METHOD_ data were compared to simulated proteolysis and cid of the proteins in the non redundant national center for biotechnology informatic _PROTEIN_ database using the sequest software . one of the proteins identified that was present in band was a kda amino acid long _PROTEIN_ that was named _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . five peptides were identified leading to unique identification as _GENE_ . this protein contains the glycosyl hydrolase domain between amino acids and . the sosui computer program predicts that the protein contains two transmembrane regions between amino acids and and between amino acids and . according to the signalp program the protein contains an n terminal signal peptide with a cleavage site between amino acids and . three different computer _METHOD_ predict that _PROTEIN_ has the essential characteristics to become glycosylphosphatidylinositol modified big _PROTEIN_ plant predictor dgpi and gpi _PROTEIN_ . this feature was recently confirmed experimentally by cleavage of the gpi anchor with phospholipases c and d . the _PROTEIN_ gene contains two exons and one intron . exon is bp long and ends immediately after the predicted gpi site which is amino acid . the intron is bp long and the second exon which contains the c terminal signal is nucleotides long . the resulting spliced coding sequence is bp which encodes a protein containing amino acids . a second version of the protein results from retention of the intron which contains a stop codon nucleotides after its beginning resulting in a bp coding sequence and a amino acid protein . this alternatively spliced protein which was entitled _PROTEIN_ was not found to be gpi anchored by the big _PROTEIN_ plant predictor while both the dgpi and gpi _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ predicted that it has the essential characteristics to become gpi modified . quantitative measurements of _PROTEIN_ transcript levels in the arabidopsis tissues using real time rt pcr revealed that the gene is not _PROTEIN_ equally in the different tissues . the transcription level of _PROTEIN_ was the highest in flowers and siliques . in stem rosette leaves and cauline leaves transcript accumulation was considerably lower than in flowers and siliques . in roots levels were negligible compared with the flowers and siliques . quantitative measurement of the alternatively spliced version of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed that transcript accumulation was a few orders of magnitude lower than the _PROTEIN_ form . we therefore focused our research on the normally spliced form of _PROTEIN_ and cautiously suggest that the presence of _PROTEIN_ results from a low efficiency of normal splicing rather than a regulated process of any biological significance a well known phenomenon in plants . however more experiments are required to confirm this assumption . in order to verify plasmodesmal localization of _PROTEIN_ a fusion between the protein and _METHOD_ was created . as _PROTEIN_ is a gpi anchored protein and both the n and c terminal ends of its preprotein are removed it was necessary to create a fusion protein with _METHOD_ within regions that remain after n and c processing . the coding sequence for _METHOD_ was thus inserted within the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence immediately after amino acid which is localized amino acids before the site . this region into which the _METHOD_ was inserted is described as a disordered/unstructured and low complexity region by the smart program and is suspected to serve as a linker between the active _PROTEIN_ domain and the gpi anchor . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ transiently in nicotiana benthamiana source leaves by microprojectile bombardment and stably in nicotiana tabacum by agrobacterium transformation . in both cases the fusion protein appeared along the entire periphery of epidermal leaf cells and in a punctate pattern or as pairs of _METHOD_ foci on opposite sides of the cell wall a pattern characteristic of pd . spongy mesophyll cells have regions with no cell cell contact where walls face an intercellular space and are devoid of pd and regions with cell cell contact where walls contain pd . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was almost undetected within cell wall regions where there is no cell cell contact . this differential labeling of walls further indicates that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is associated with pd or with the wall sheath surrounding pd . to verify that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ foci inside cell walls indeed represent pd we stained callose using aniline blue . callose has been widely used as a plasmodesmal marker . when transgenic tobacco source leaves _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were stained by aniline blue _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ co localized with the aniline blue stained callose present around pd . control experiments verified that no _METHOD_ _METHOD_ is seen under aniline blue conditions and no aniline blue _METHOD_ is seen under _METHOD_ conditions . as _PROTEIN_ is a gpi anchored protein it is expected to target both the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . indeed when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is transiently _PROTEIN_ by agrobacterium leaf injection it can be seen to accumulate in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . likewise as predicted _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ also localizes to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic leaves were stained with a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker and cells were plasmolysed . following plasmolysis _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ could be seen to recede from the cell wall along with the _METHOD_ stained _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . it is hypothesized that non selective plasmodesmal conductivity is a function of the steady state level of callose accumulation in the wall sleeve surrounding pd and that this steady state level is the net result of _PROTEIN_ versus synthase activities . assuming no change in callose synthase activity a lower _PROTEIN_ activity in the pd is expected to increase callose levels and reduce cell to cell transport . to test this hypothesis we measured the diffusion of _METHOD_ between leaf epidermal cells in wild type and _PROTEIN_ knockout mutants . as _METHOD_ movement between cells is diffusive it is expected that in _PROTEIN_ knockout mutant plants there will be less callose hydrolysis resulting in a narrowing of the cytoplasmic sleeve and hence a slower diffusion of _METHOD_ . two independent arabidopsis lines carrying a t dna insertion that disrupts the _PROTEIN_ locus were employed to test this hypothesis . pcr analysis and sequencing of the two t dna lines established that the insertion in disrupted the gene at bp downstream of the _PROTEIN_ start codon and that the insertion in is located bp from the _PROTEIN_ start . plants of the two lines homozygous for the insertion do not transcribe _PROTEIN_ rna as determined by rt pcr . epidermal cells of vegetative wild type and mutant leaves were transfected with _METHOD_ by microprojectile bombardment of gold particles a method that wounds the leaf and induces callose formation . forty eight hours postbombardment the number of the cells in a cluster created by _METHOD_ movement was analyzed by scanning the epidermal cells using a confocal laser scanning microscope _PROTEIN_ . the cells counted are those showing green _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ and the cytoplasm . a box plot analysis comparing the sizes of the _METHOD_ clusters in leaves of wild type and knockout mutants shows that in wild type plants the diffusion of _METHOD_ is more extensive . a one way anova analysis revealed no statistical difference between salk and sail mutants but showed a statistically significant difference between the mutants and wild type . in a second analysis the exponential decay parameter and the coefficient of conductivity of pd c were calculated for _METHOD_ spread in vegetative leaves of the wild type and _PROTEIN_ knockout mutants according to the protocol described by citation . the _METHOD_ value in wild type plants was found to be higher than the _METHOD_ value in the salk and sail mutants . a one way anova of showed no difference between the salk and sail mutants but showed a statistically significant difference between the mutants and the wild type . the results suggest that the conductivity of pd is downregulated in _PROTEIN_ deficient mutants . aaverage decay parameter also termed impedance which describes the slope of the gradient formed by differences in plasmodesmal conductivity . bse _PROTEIN_ value . cthe coefficient of conductivity of plasmodesmata for the cell to cell spread of _METHOD_ calculated as value . dthe number in parentheses is the number of cells analyzed . to test whether the _PROTEIN_ cell to cell movement of _METHOD_ results from increased callose accumulation in pd we examined the amount of pd callose in the epidermis of arabidopsis vegetative source leaves days after wounding employing an aniline blue _METHOD_ assay . quantification of _METHOD_ sites in _PROTEIN_ deficient mutants and _METHOD_ sites in wild type plants revealed that callose accumulation was higher in _PROTEIN_ mutants . an independent samples t test showed the results to be significantly different at p < . although the background levels varied between repeats with different leaves the net intensity in the pd was the same . these results are in agreement with the hypothesized role of callose in regulating pd function and support the hypothesis _PROTEIN_ functions as a plasmodesmal protein .
