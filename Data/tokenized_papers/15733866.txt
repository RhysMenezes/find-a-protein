the arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ is a p type _PROTEIN_ that clusters with the zn/cd/pb/co subgroup . it has been previously shown by heterologous _PROTEIN_ and the study of _PROTEIN_ knockout or overexpressing lines in arabidopsis that _PROTEIN_ is implicated in zinc homeostasis and cadmium tolerance . here we report the study of the heterologous _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ resulted in an increased tolerance to zn cd and pb and to a phenotypic complementation of hypersensitive mutants . in contrast an increased sensitivity towards co was observed . an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was observed in endocytic vesicles and at the yeast _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . mutagenesis of the cysteine and glutamate residues from the n ter degenerated heavy metal binding domain impaired the function of _PROTEIN_ . it was also the case when the c ter his stretch was deleted giving evidence that these amino acids are essential for the _PROTEIN_ binding/translocation of metals .
_PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in yeast was evaluated using an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion chimera . western blots using anti _METHOD_ horseradish peroxidase antibodies confirmed the presence of the protein in the microsomal fraction . under _METHOD_ microscopy _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed as an intracellular punctuated staining . such localization was unexpected since in planta _PROTEIN_ is believed to function as an efflux pump and localized at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in transient _PROTEIN_ experiments . however some yeast _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins such as also exhibit a punctuated distribution due to a rapid turnover resulting from endocytosis . such process could affect _PROTEIN_ whose sequence displays numerous dileucine motifs hypothesized to initiate an endocytosis mediated catabolism of this transporter . therefore we monitored _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization in the mutant of s. cerevisiae which is known to be defective for endocytosis . when _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed a rim staining pattern revealing a partial localization at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . based on its sequence _PROTEIN_ has been predicted as a putative zn/cd/pb/co transporter . previous studies have shown that alteration of the level of _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in planta or in heterologous _METHOD_ leads in zn cd and pb over tolerance/sensitivity . when _PROTEIN_ in the wild type yeast strain _PROTEIN_ was able to increase the yeast cd tolerance up to as exemplified by drop test experiments . in the context a yeast mutant extremely sensitive to cd _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was able to restore the tolerance to cd to the level of the wild type . interestingly the cd tolerance enhancement conferred by _PROTEIN_ was unaffected by the _METHOD_ fusion at the c terminal part of the protein . a series of drop test experiments were also carried out in presence of a range of zn concentrations . _PROTEIN_ transformants were slightly more resistant to zn than the wild type strain up to a concentration of mm . _PROTEIN_ was also _PROTEIN_ in the context . the zn hypersensitive strain is a deletion mutant of the zinc _LOCATION_ transporter belonging to the cdf family . as shown in a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ partially restored the zn tolerance of the strain . similar experiments were performed with pb acetate supplied in solid medium . in agreement with a previous work we observed that the strain was highly sensitive to pb . when _PROTEIN_ in the context _PROTEIN_ was able to partially restore the growth capability of this strain in the presence of pb . finally _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in the co hypersensitive mutant defective for the corresponding cdf _LOCATION_ transporter . surprisingly the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ enhanced co sensitivity of the wild type and strains . other metals were screened but no change in yeast tolerance to these metals was observed when _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ . altogether these results argue that _PROTEIN_ is able to accept the predicted metals i.e. zn/cd/pb/co as substrates leading to different phenotypes metal tolerance or sensitivity . it has been shown above that _PROTEIN_ is able to rescue the cd hypersensitivity of the mutant . in this mutant an abc transporter _PROTEIN_ which drives cd diglutathione complexes to the _LOCATION_ is disrupted . it is unclear until now whether p type _PROTEIN_ from the zn/cd/pb/co group require a conjugated form of the metal as substrate . interestingly in a recent in vitro biochemical characterization of _PROTEIN_ the presence of millimolar free cysteine was required to observe the phosphorylation of the enzyme in the presence of metal . this result suggests that a conjugated form of the metal is required as substrate . to determine if _PROTEIN_ accepts as a substrate cd glutathione complexes we used buthionine sulfoximine a known inhibitor of the glutamylcysteine synthase . in the presence of cd and mm bso the strain growth was completely inhibited while wild type and strains grew slightly . interestingly the strains _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ grew at the same rate in the presence or absence of bso . this result shows that contrarily to _PROTEIN_ does not need a glutathione s conjugated form of the metal to transport cd . to determine whether increased tolerance to cd and phenotypic complementation were due to metal transport or to a metal chelation a substitution in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was generated . asp belongs to the strictly conserved dktgt motif in all p _PROTEIN_ and is predicted to be the invariant residue phosphorylated in the activated enzyme during catalysis . thus the transport function should be impaired in the _PROTEIN_ mutant as previously described for _PROTEIN_ . indeed as exemplified in a this mutant form when _PROTEIN_ in yeast did not induce any increased tolerance to cd and zn nor complementation of the and strains . liquid culture experiments carried out in the same range of cadmium concentrations used in drop tests confirmed the results obtained on plates . these results demonstrate that cd resistance induced by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ results from the transport activity of the enzyme . additionally cd and zn contents in the wild type yeast and _PROTEIN_ transformed strains were compared by icp aes . when _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in the wild type strain the cd content was drastically diminished compared to the level found in only transformants . similar results were obtained for the zn content determined after growth of the yeast strains under standard conditions . in contrast at very high zn concentration the zn tolerant phenotype was independent of a zn _PROTEIN_ in the yeast strain _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as exemplified in . given the strong cd tolerance phenotype acquired by yeasts _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ site directed mutagenesis was used to determine the functional importance of the specific mbd of _PROTEIN_ in cd resistance . these experiments were carried out with different altered _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ affecting the n ter mbd the _PROTEIN_ domain the c ter first two dicysteine motifs and his stretch . the _PROTEIN_ of the different altered versions was verified by western blots . the p type _PROTEIN_ present one or more hma domains in their hydrophilic amino terminal region . instead of this conserved motif _PROTEIN_ presents the degenerated sequence g icctse . as shown in all substitutions affecting this degenerated core sequence had deleterious effects on the _PROTEIN_ complementation efficiency . thus in the presence of various cd or zn concentrations the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ failed to complement the and zrc strains respectively . nevertheless the _PROTEIN_ altered version slightly rescued the but not the strains . these results highlight an essential role of the double cystein motif in the activity of the enzyme and to a lesser extent a functional role of the glutamate that could participate in the metal binding aim to its _PROTEIN_ group . it has been shown in cada the cd _PROTEIN_ of listeria monocytogenes that both cysteine residues in the _PROTEIN_ motif are essential for phosphorylation of the enzyme and substitutions of these residues impair the function of the enzyme . a similar loss of function was observed when the first cysteine from the _PROTEIN_ motif of _PROTEIN_ were substituted for a serine . such result was unexpected since few p type _PROTEIN_ among which _PROTEIN_ rather close to _PROTEIN_ bear such spc degenerated motif . the _PROTEIN_ protein presents an unusually large hydrophilic c ter extension of about aa that brings numerous putative mbds such as cysteine pairs . as the first two pairs are the only conserved at the c ter part of the cd/pb transporter _PROTEIN_ we hypothesized that they could play an important role for the metal transport function . however _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ substitutions affecting the first two cysteine pairs at the c ter part of the protein had no effect on the and the complementations . a peculiarity of _PROTEIN_ is to present an eleven histidine stretch at its c ter part . such an his rich motif is found in the n ter part of few p _PROTEIN_ such _PROTEIN_ from a. thaliana or from oscillatoria brevis which transports both monovalent and divalent cations . biochemical experiments on the cu _PROTEIN_ copb from archeoglobus fulgidus have demonstrated that the deletion of the his rich n ter mbd leads to a half _PROTEIN_ of the metal transport rate . when _PROTEIN_ in yeast _PROTEIN_ the form truncated of the c ter his stretch failed to complement any of the hypersensitive mutant strains . this result shows that this histidine stretch also found in _PROTEIN_ is essential to the function of the protein .
cloning of the _PROTEIN_ cdna was performed as previously described in except the primer pair used as end primer and _PROTEIN_ as end reverse primer both designed on the bac sequence . the full length _PROTEIN_ cdna was obtained in a unique fragment by a two steps rt pcr cloned in the pcr xl topo vector and sequenced . then _PROTEIN_ cdna was excised from the pcr xl topo vector and cloned into the yeast _PROTEIN_ vector under a galactose inducible promoter . to obtain the _PROTEIN_ altered version a stop codon was introduced by pcr in the _PROTEIN_ cdna using the primer pair as forward and _PROTEIN_ as reverse oligonucleotides and the fragment was subcloned into the plasmid _PROTEIN_ . to create the _PROTEIN_ efgp fusion the _PROTEIN_ cdna was excised from the pcr xl topo vector and cloned in frame into the _METHOD_ vector . the various substituted _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ were obtained using the quickchange site directed mutagenesis kit using the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ vector as a template . saccharomyces cerevisiae reference strain and mutant strains and were provided by euroscarf . _METHOD_ fusion cloned into the vector was used to complement the strain . yeast transformation and growth conditions were as described in . all metal tolerance assays were performed as previously described in . for the drop test experiments on solid media of the yeast cultures at o.d . nm was spread and three fold serial dilutions were made . metal solutions _PROTEIN_ cocl were added to the liquid or solid media at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends . the yeast strains _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein were grown as described in . _METHOD_ excitation was performed at nm using a dichroic mirror . observations were carried out at a magnification of na under oil immersion . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was monitored with a color camera and analyzed with the analysis software . yeast cells were grown as described for metal tolerance assays . cell mineralization and heavy metal content determination by icp were as described in .
