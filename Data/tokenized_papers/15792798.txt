isu are scaffold proteins involved in iron sulfur cluster biogenesis and playing a key role in yeast mitochondria and escherichia coli . in this work we have characterized the arabidopsis thaliana isu gene family . _PROTEIN_ genes encode polypeptides closely related to their bacterial and eukaryotic counterparts . atisu _PROTEIN_ in a saccharomyces cerevisiae _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ thermosensitive mutant led to the growth restoration of this strain at . using isu _METHOD_ fusions _PROTEIN_ in leaf protoplasts and immunodetection in organelle extracts we have shown that arabidopsis isu proteins are located only into mitochondria supporting the existence of an isu independent fe s assembly machinery in plant _LOCATION_ .
using e. coli iscu as a starting sequence a search for genes encoding homologous proteins into the arabidopsis genome database at tair website was performed . three genes encoding putative proteins presenting significant sequence identity with eciscu were identified . the corresponding cdnas were cloned by an rt pcr approach enabling to correct inaccurate annotation of gene . _PROTEIN_ cdnas correspond respectively to genes . alignment of atisu primary sequences with isu protein sequences from bacteria human and yeast revealed a very high conservation of these polypeptides during evolution . atisu primary sequences share an average of sequence identity with eciscu whereas arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ share from to identity between them . among the conserved amino acids three cysteines are strictly conserved in all isu sequences . these residues have been shown to be essential for the function of yeast _PROTEIN_ in vivo as demonstrated by functional complementation of a yeast _PROTEIN_ strain . it has been established that iscu interact with hsca like chaperones through an lppvk motif . this sequence is strictly conserved in atisu proteins suggesting a similar protein protein interaction in plants . the existence of hsca homologous genes in arabidopsis genome whose product are predicted to be targeted to mitochondria support such a hypothesis . comparison of eukaryotic isu and their bacterial counterparts revealed the presence of an nt extension . this additional sequence is known to be involved into the mitochondrial targeting of human and yeast isu proteins . arabidopsis isu primary sequences also include such a peptide which could therefore play a role into the intracellular targeting of these proteins . primary sequence analysis of atisu strongly support that these highly conserved proteins are functional members of the isu fe s scaffold family of proteins . to investigate such a function in vivo a yeast complementation assay was performed using a strain affected in _PROTEIN_ gene . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant strain was first described by schilke et al . who demonstrated its thermosensitive growth defect while no phenotype was observed for single _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutants . we have previously used _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ strain for the functional characterization of atnfu proteins . the thermosensitivity of the mutant strain was confirmed by its growth defect at when transformed with a empty vector . on the opposite _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ or into the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ yeast strain resulted in a growth restoration of the mutant at . such an experiment argues in favour of the ability of the atisu proteins to act as fe s scaffold in yeast mitochondria . atisu gene _PROTEIN_ was investigated using non quantitative rt pcr in different organs of day old plants . _PROTEIN_ transcript appeared to be _PROTEIN_ in all tissues tested like the actin control in agreement with data recently published by tone et al . . on the contrary _PROTEIN_ and mrna showed distinct and specific patterns of _PROTEIN_ . both mrna were detected in leaves and flowers rna samples . _PROTEIN_ mrna _PROTEIN_ pattern was restricted to these two organs whereas _PROTEIN_ was also present in roots . the presence of a putative targeting peptide within atisu protein sequences led us to investigate their intracellular localization . yeast isu proteins are located into mitochondria the unique site for fe s biogenesis in this organism . however in plant cells both _LOCATION_ and mitochondria would be involved in fe s biogenesis . tong et al . have investigated the _PROTEIN_ of human iscu gene . this single gene produces two distinct mrna by alternative splicing differing only in their region . such a divergence lead to the _PROTEIN_ of protein addressed to the mitochondria and remaining in the _LOCATION_ . we have performed _PROTEIN_ experiments using mrna extracted from the different tissues mentioned in and we were able to detect only one mrna species for each atisu . such data rule out the possibility of a differential targeting of arabidopsis isu by a similar mechanism as the one occurring in human . to determine the intracellular localization of atisu proteins fusions were prepared between part of the isu cdna containing the putative targeting sequence and the _METHOD_ coding region . the chimeric proteins were transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaf protoplasts under the control of the promoter . _METHOD_ protein from the control vector was detected into the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ whereas isu _METHOD_ fusions appeared to be targeted to an intracellular compartment . using mitotracker as a _METHOD_ marker for mitochondria atisu were located into mitochondria . no signal was detected in chloroplasts visualized using the chlorophyll _METHOD_ . to further confirm the intracellular localization of atisu polypeptides recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein deleted of its targeting sequence was produced in e. coli and polyclonal antibodies were raised against this polypeptide . according to the very high conservation of arabidopsis isu primary sequences we have chosen to produce antibodies against only one of the three atisu assuming it will recognize the two other proteins . fractionation of leaf material was performed to produce mitochondria and chloroplast enriched fractions . purity of the fractions was assessed using antibodies raised against chloroplast ribosome recycling _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or subunit of mitochondrial nadh dehydrogenase . immunodetection of isu proteins in these samples revealed a signal only into the mitochondrial fraction confirming therefore the results obtained using the _METHOD_ and the absence of the isu fe s scaffold protein in the chloroplasts .
