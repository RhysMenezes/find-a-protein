autophagy is an intracellular process for _LOCATION_ degradation of cytoplasmic components . thus far plant autophagy has been studied primarily using morphological analyses . a recent genome wide search revealed significant conservation among autophagy genes _PROTEIN_ in yeast and plants . it has not been proved however that arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ genes are required for plant autophagy . to evaluate this requirement we examined the ubiquitination like lipidation system whose component genes are all found in the arabidopsis genome . in arabidopsis all nine _PROTEIN_ genes and two _PROTEIN_ genes were _PROTEIN_ ubiquitously and were induced further by nitrogen starvation . to establish a system monitoring autophagy in whole plants we generated transgenic arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ each green _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ fusion _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . in wild type plants _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were observed as _PROTEIN_ shapes in the cytoplasm and were delivered to _LOCATION_ lumens under nitrogen starved conditions . by contrast in a t dna insertion double mutant of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ autophagosomes were not observed and the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were not delivered to the _LOCATION_ under nitrogen starved conditions . in addition we detected autophagic bodies in the _LOCATION_ of wild type roots but not in those of _PROTEIN_ in the presence of concanamycin a a v _PROTEIN_ inhibitor . biochemical analyses also provided evidence that autophagy in higher plants requires _PROTEIN_ proteins . the phenotypic analysis of _PROTEIN_ indicated that plant autophagy contributes to the development of a root system under conditions of nutrient limitation .
in our previous report we searched for homologs of yeast _PROTEIN_ genes in the arabidopsis genome and identified nine candidate _PROTEIN_ . all the _PROTEIN_ proteins display a high degree of identity with the yeast protein and the gly residues at their c terminal regions are conserved . interestingly two of the nine homologs _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ had no c terminal extension after the gly residue . to examine where the _PROTEIN_ function we performed _PROTEIN_ analysis of _PROTEIN_ through _PROTEIN_ by rt pcr . because the nucleotide sequences of the coding regions of _PROTEIN_ are highly conserved gene specific primers corresponding to each _PROTEIN_ from the or untranslated regions were designed based on sequences found in the arabidopsis est database . total cellular rnas were isolated from roots _METHOD_ leaves flowers and siliques of wild type arabidopsis grown in hydroponic culture for to weeks and subjected to rt pcr . as shown in figure all _PROTEIN_ were ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ in every organ tested . next in intact plants the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ i mrna under nitrogen starvation was examined by quantitative rt pcr because the abundance of both the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrnas increased when leaves were artificially senescent under nutrient depleted conditions in the dark . for nitrogen starvation week old wild type arabidopsis plants grown in nutrient medium were transferred to nitrogen depleted medium . after and h of nitrogen starvation total cellular rna isolated from leaves were subjected to quantitative rt pcr analysis . the _PROTEIN_ of all _PROTEIN_ was moderately induced by nitrogen starvation however each _PROTEIN_ showed a different pattern of induction . next in addition to _PROTEIN_ we also focused on _PROTEIN_ homologs which may function in the c terminal cleavage of _PROTEIN_ required for their modification and in the deconjugation of their modified _METHOD_ . two homologs of the _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ and were identified in the arabidopsis genome . _PROTEIN_ proteins had a significant but low level of identity with the yeast _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . however the two _PROTEIN_ displayed overall amino acid identity . the cys asp and his residues which comprise the catalytic site were well conserved in _PROTEIN_ . in addition both _PROTEIN_ complemented the autophagic defect caused by the yeast _PROTEIN_ mutation . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ and are yeast _PROTEIN_ orthologs . we also performed _PROTEIN_ analysis of _PROTEIN_ and by rt pcr using gene specific primers . as shown in figure the two _PROTEIN_ were ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ like _PROTEIN_ . the induction of _PROTEIN_ transcription under nitrogen starvation was examined by semiquantitative rt pcr . with h of starvation both _PROTEIN_ were immediately and drastically induced . first of all to detect _PROTEIN_ proteins antibodies against _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were made . because of their high conservation of the primary sequences the cross reactivity of these antibodies was tested in lysates of yeast cells _PROTEIN_ each _PROTEIN_ . the anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies recognized all _PROTEIN_ proteins with varying degrees of reactivity whereas the anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies recognized mostly _PROTEIN_ but faintly _PROTEIN_ . to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ are also processed at the c terminus by _PROTEIN_ each _PROTEIN_ was tagged with three consecutive myc epitopes at the c terminus and was _PROTEIN_ in the yeast _PROTEIN_ mutant . total cell lysates were then subjected to immunoblot analysis with an anti myc antibody . in every cell a single band of kd was detected corresponding to the molecular sizes of the _PROTEIN_ fusion protein . next _PROTEIN_ or was coexpressed in these cells followed by an immunoblot analysis with anti _PROTEIN_ and antibodies . a single band of kd appeared which was not detectable with the anti myc antibody . these data indicate that the c terminal extensions of _PROTEIN_ g had been cleaved by the _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and are novel types of _PROTEIN_ which did not possess additional amino acids after gly and it is not supposed to be subjected to the cleavage by _PROTEIN_ as in the other _PROTEIN_ . however it is noteworthy that ectopically fused c termini of _PROTEIN_ and were also susceptible to the cleavage in the _PROTEIN_ dependent manner . next we investigated the intracellular distribution of _PROTEIN_ by subcellular fractionation . leaves of week old wild type arabidopsis were homogenized and the post _LOCATION_ supernatant was fractionated by successive centrifugation to generate a pellet fraction _PROTEIN_ a pellet fraction _PROTEIN_ and a supernatant fraction _PROTEIN_ . bands of kd were detected by the anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies corresponding to the predicted size of _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ were predominantly detected in the pellet fraction mostly in the _PROTEIN_ . small amounts were recovered from the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . next we tried to solubilize the _PROTEIN_ from the pellet fractions by resuspension in a buffer containing m nacl m urea m triton x and deoxycholate . samples were centrifuged again and the supernatant and the pellet were analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies . _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ fraction could not be extracted by salt urea or alkali but were almost completely solubilized by triton x or doc . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ fraction are tightly associated with the _LOCATION_ . on the other hand _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ fraction were partially solubilized by salt urea or alkali and almost completely by detergent suggesting that some of the protein in the _PROTEIN_ fraction was peripherally _LOCATION_ associated . previous reports have shown that the modified form of yeast which is conjugated with pe migrates faster than the unmodified form of yeast on a m urea _PROTEIN_ gel . taking advantage of this gel system we attempted to detect the modified _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ . on a urea _PROTEIN_ gel most of the _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ fraction migrated faster but not those from the _PROTEIN_ fraction . in addition recently it was reported that also conjugated with pe in animal cells . thus we postulated these faster migrating _METHOD_ to be putative pe conjugated _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . most of the _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ fraction were the _PROTEIN_ but those in the _PROTEIN_ fractions were the unmodified form . these experiments suggest that most _PROTEIN_ exist as the _PROTEIN_ and are associated with _LOCATION_ . these results are in principle consistent with the biochemical properties of yeast . we examined the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ proteins in different organs and different growth stages by immunoblot analysis using anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ were ubiquitously detected in all organs examined and the protein levels were higher in root flower and silique . in addition to unmodified _METHOD_ two faster migrating _METHOD_ the _PROTEIN_ were detected . the banding patterns differed slightly among all organs suggesting that different _PROTEIN_ may be functionally assigned to each organ . furthermore _PROTEIN_ were detected throughout all growth stages the level of protein _PROTEIN_ increased until the plant reached weeks followed by a gradual _PROTEIN_ . we also investigated the _PROTEIN_ in leaves of different growth stages . interestingly the level of the _PROTEIN_ also increased as growth progressed peaking in week old plants which is the stage just before bolting . next the subcellular localization of green _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was examined by polyethylene glycol mediated transient _PROTEIN_ assays using arabidopsis cultured cells . we made nine constructs in which each _PROTEIN_ open reading frame was fused to the c terminus of _METHOD_ and placed under the control of the constitutive promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus . _METHOD_ alone was _PROTEIN_ as a negative control . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ exhibited _PROTEIN_ and punctate structures which are thought to be autophagosomes and their precursors in addition to the evenly stained _LOCATION_ . interestingly in some cases _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localized also to the inside of the _LOCATION_ . because _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ do not require processing of the c terminal extension by _PROTEIN_ they may be delivered to _LOCATION_ more quickly than other _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . in the case of _PROTEIN_ g the level of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ may be limiting because only _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were transiently overexpressed after strong promoter . we also constructed _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ a e a and i a in which each c terminal gly was substituted by an ala residue . the resultant fusion proteins were found in dot structures smaller than the _PROTEIN_ that were observed upon _PROTEIN_ of the wild type _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . these experiments indicate that the substitution of the c terminal gly results in defective localization to preautophagosomal structures . the behavior of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was also investigated under nutrient starvation conditions . as shown in figures and _LOCATION_ swelled after h of incubation in nitrogen free medium and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ e and i were delivered to the _LOCATION_ . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ a e a and i a however were not delivered to the _LOCATION_ . the most probable explanation is that the _PROTEIN_ as could not be cleaved by the _PROTEIN_ or modified at their c termini because of the substitution of the c terminal gly to an ala residue consequently the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ as were not able to localize to the putative preautophagosomal structures preventing the effective delivery of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ as to the _LOCATION_ . these results suggest that the c terminal gly of all _PROTEIN_ is essential for autophagy namely the _PROTEIN_ system functions in a similar manner in plant autophagy as in yeast . from these results we have also shown that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ are functional and good molecular markers for monitoring plant autophagy . to elucidate the role of _PROTEIN_ in whole plants we generated the t dna insertion double mutant _PROTEIN_ . the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ proteins are encoded by two genes located on the bottom arm of chromosomes and . we screened a population of t dna insertional mutants obtained from the university of wisconsin arabidopsis knockout facility and kazusa dna research institute and isolated two t dna insertion single mutants which we designated _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants contain t dna insertions in the second exon bp downstream of the translational initiation codon and in the fifth intron bp downstream of the translational initiation codon respectively . the segregation pattern of antibiotic resistance revealed a single t dna insertion in _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ plants . we performed a backcross and obtained an _PROTEIN_ mutant with only a single t dna insertion in which the antibiotic resistance gene was deleted . rt pcr analysis using gene specific primers that span the t dna insertion confirmed the absence of full length _PROTEIN_ and mrna in both of the respective mutants . we conclude that these alleles represent null mutations . to obtain double mutant plants plants homozygous for _PROTEIN_ and for _PROTEIN_ were crossed . homozygous double mutant plants _PROTEIN_ were identified by pcr in progeny after self pollination . in the _PROTEIN_ mutant neither of the full length mrnas encoding _PROTEIN_ and were detected indicating that this mutant is devoid of functional _PROTEIN_ proteins . after three backcrosses to the wild type homozygous _PROTEIN_ plants were used for further study . to investigate the behavior of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants total proteins prepared from leaves of wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and plants were subjected to urea _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and immunoblot analysis with anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies . as shown in figure faster migrating bands were detected in wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants . like in yeast the faster migrating _PROTEIN_ bands were detected also in plants . by contrast the fastest migrating band was completely absent in _PROTEIN_ plants . these results support the conclusion that the fastest migrating band which is observed in wild type plants represents the _PROTEIN_ . the other faster migrating band was faintly detected even in _PROTEIN_ . the band was not consistent with the band detected with anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies . the level of _PROTEIN_ was drastically increased in _PROTEIN_ and plants but in two single mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ levels were similar to those in the wild type . therefore it is likely that in _PROTEIN_ the band of unmodified form that was not detected in the wild type appeared in the same position as _PROTEIN_ . why did the level of _PROTEIN_ increase in atg disruption mutants ? one possibility is that each _PROTEIN_ transcript increases in disruption mutants to compensate for the defect in autophagy . it is more likely however that _PROTEIN_ proteins are not delivered to the _LOCATION_ because of the defect in autophagy and consequently are not degraded . next we examined the intracellular distribution of _PROTEIN_ in atg mutants by subcellular fractionation . in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and plants _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ recovered in the _PROTEIN_ fraction as they are in the wild type plants . by contrast as expected in _PROTEIN_ plants _PROTEIN_ were recovered primarily in the _PROTEIN_ and only at low levels in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fractions indicating that _PROTEIN_ could not be converted into _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ . wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ alone were generated to confirm whether the disruption of _PROTEIN_ affect intracellular localization of _PROTEIN_ in whole plants . as shown in figure in roots of wild type plants grown under nutrient rich conditions every fusion protein was observed in many _PROTEIN_ shaped and punctate structures which are interpreted to be autophagosomes and their intermediates . by contrast these structures were not observed in roots of _PROTEIN_ plants although some small dot structures were observed . the putative pe conjugated form was detected only in the wild type plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ but not in the _PROTEIN_ plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ supporting that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins are functional . in the solubilization experiment the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was effectively solubilized by ionic detergent doc but faintly solubilized by nonionic detergent triton x suggesting that the small dot structures observed in _PROTEIN_ cells could be aggregated proteins . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ are required for formation of autophagosomes by permitting the association of _PROTEIN_ to _LOCATION_ . to monitor autophagy in a whole plant we examined the behavior of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ under nitrogen starved conditions in wild type plants . for nitrogen starvation d old seedlings grown in nutrient rich medium _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were transferred to nitrogen depleted medium _METHOD_ . after d of nitrogen starvation the roots were observed by _METHOD_ laser scanning confocal microscopy . under these conditions every fusion protein was delivered to _LOCATION_ lumens in wild type roots . on the other hand in _PROTEIN_ none of these fusion proteins even _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ which does not have the c terminal extension after the gly residue were delivered to the _LOCATION_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ are essential for plant autophagy via deconjugation of _PROTEIN_ . concanamycin a a v _PROTEIN_ inhibitor is known to raise the ph in _LOCATION_ lumens when exogenously added to plant cells . consequently it is expected that under such high ph conditions _LOCATION_ hydrolases can not act leading to the accumulation of autophagic bodies in the _LOCATION_ . roots of week old wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were treated with concanamycin a for h under nitrogen starved conditions and then observed by microscopy . nomarski images are shown in figures and . in wild type roots treated with concanamycin a there were many spherical structures in well developed _LOCATION_ . these structures were stained by _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ suggesting that they were plant autophagic bodies . by contrast _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ were small and did not contain spherical structures . next electron microscopy was performed . in wild type roots single _LOCATION_ bound vesicles in diameter were observed . these vesicles were electron dense and contained cytoplasmic structures such as mitochondria _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ bodies demonstrating that they were indeed plant autophagic bodies . by contrast there were no autophagic bodies in the _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ plants . furthermore the _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ mutants were smaller than those of wild type plants in the cells around the root cap or meristem . in yeast swollen _LOCATION_ are typically observed as autophagy progresses under nitrogen starved conditions . our results suggest that autophagy might contribute to the swelling of _LOCATION_ relatively soon after exposure to nutrient depleted conditions . to verify that the defect in accumulation of autophagic bodies that is autophagy in the _PROTEIN_ mutant was caused by the t dna insertion in each of the two _PROTEIN_ genes we performed a functional complementation experiment . a genomic _PROTEIN_ fragment encompassing its flanking area and coding region was transformed into the _PROTEIN_ mutant . five independent transformants harboring the transgene were selected by antibiotic resistance and confirmed by pcr for the presence of the transgene and for the absence of the wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ alleles . the _PROTEIN_ of the transgene rescued the defective accumulation of autophagic bodies indicating that the defect in autophagy was caused by the combination of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations . the above results led us to conclude that _PROTEIN_ plants are defective in autophagy . this is the first direct evidence that _PROTEIN_ genes are essential for plant autophagy . previous studies by our group and vierstra 's group demonstrated that disruption of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the senescence of cotyledon and rosette leaves and moreover that both of the mutant plants develop fewer flowers and siliques resulting in fewer seeds . these phenotypes were also observed in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . in addition when d old seedlings grown in nutrient rich medium were transferred to nitrogen depleted medium it appeared that _PROTEIN_ root elongation was severely inhibited in _PROTEIN_ plants . to confirm the inhibition of _PROTEIN_ root elongation in _PROTEIN_ plants under nitrogen starved conditions seeds of wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants were sowed on nitrogen starvation medium _METHOD_ and primary root length number of _PROTEIN_ roots and total length of _PROTEIN_ roots were scored in d old seedlings . the rate of primary root elongation of _PROTEIN_ mutants was lower than that of wild type plants . the total number of _PROTEIN_ roots per primary root in _PROTEIN_ seedlings was also reduced compared with wild type seedlings and the total length of _PROTEIN_ roots per primary root was even more severely _PROTEIN_ indicating that the length of the total root system was reduced in this autophagy defective mutant . these results indicate that autophagy contributes to root elongation under nutrient depleted conditions .
the arabidopsis thaliana ecotype wassilewskija was used in this study . the plants were grown on rockwool using vermiculite as soil or hydroponically at with h h dark cycles . the hydroponic culture was performed as described by citation . for nitrogen starvation week old plants hydroponically grown in nutrient medium were transferred to nitrogen depleted medium that had been prepared by replacing _PROTEIN_ and ca with kcl and . for plate grown plants seeds were surface sterilized _PROTEIN_ at for d and then sown and grown on _METHOD_ medium . for nitrogen depleted _METHOD_ medium

examine the effect of nitrogen starvation on the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ i _PROTEIN_ and genes of total cellular rna from leaves was isolated after and h of nitrogen starvation and subjected to quantitative or semiquantitative rt pcr . quantitative rt pcr was performed by the method described previously . gene specific primers used for quantitative rt pcr are as follows for _PROTEIN_ tcgattcttcttctccagtttcaatca and ccattgcgattcgattagtctccgaag for _PROTEIN_ ttacctcagcttctacgtctgatcctc and _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and ggcgattaaagaatcaaagattagggc for _PROTEIN_

ccaacactttgtttgcaaaccgattgg and ggtgttcttgcttttaattgaatgtaa for _PROTEIN_ h gaacaatcaaaaacgaactaaccaaac and _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ gcagtgagaaaacctttggttgatcc and _PROTEIN_ . the gene specificity of each primer was confirmed by pcr using plasmids subcloned each full length cdna . the _PROTEIN_ and coding regions from nucleotides to of _PROTEIN_ and to of _PROTEIN_ were amplified by pcr from the full length cdna using the following primers for _PROTEIN_ cgcggatcccaatggctaagagttccttc and cgcggatcctccaaaagtgttctctccactgt and for _PROTEIN_ cgcggatccagatgaaatcgttcaaggaacaatac and cgcggatccaccaaaggttttctcactgct designed to contain a bamhi site at both ends . the resulting products were digested with bamhi and inserted into pgex for _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli . after h of induction with mm isopropyl d thiogalactopyranoside the _PROTEIN_ and recombinant proteins were purified from the lysates by affinity chromatography on a glutathione sepharose column using _PROTEIN_ xa and used to raise polyclonal antibodies in rabbits . antisera against _PROTEIN_ and were subsequently affinity purified by passing the sera over a column of _PROTEIN_ or recombinant proteins coupled to cyanogen bromide activated sepharose . plant protein samples were prepared as follows mg of each plant were homogenized in of _PROTEIN_ sample buffer without a reducing agent and bromophenol blue _PROTEIN_ and boiled for to min then centrifuged at for min . the resultant supernatant was used as total protein . total proteins were quantified by the bca protein assay reagent kit

blocked using milk powder . primary and secondary antibodies were diluted and in tbs containing tween respectively . the secondary antibodies used were peroxidase conjugated goat anti rabbit immunoglobulins _PROTEIN_ . signals were detected using the western lightning chemiluminescence reagent plus kit . to _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ proteins in yeast arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ genes were

pcr from the full length cdna using the following primers for _PROTEIN_ cgcggatcccaatggctaagagttccttc and cgcggatcctccaaaagtgttctctccactgt for _PROTEIN_ cgcggatcctcatggagaagaactccttcaagc and cgcggatccaccaaatgtgttctctccactgt for _PROTEIN_ cgcggatccccatggctaatagctctttcaag and cgcggatccaccaaaggtgttctctccactg for _PROTEIN_ cgcggatcctcatggcgattagctccttcaa and cgcggatcccccgaacgtgttctcaccactg

cgcggatccagatgaaatcgttcaaggaacaatac and cgcggatccaccaaaggttttctcactgct designed to contain a bamhi site at both ends . the fragments digested with bamhi were substituted for the bamhi bamhi _PROTEIN_ orf fragment of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which contains an _PROTEIN_ fragment that includes the promoter region and the inserted sequence . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was generated by cloning kb of the spei ecori fragment from an _PROTEIN_ plasmid which was derived from the _PROTEIN_ vector into the yeast _PROTEIN_ vector _PROTEIN_ containing a _PROTEIN_ marker . cells of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were transformed with these plasmids . the transformants were cultured in sc without leucine medium to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or sc minus leucine and uracil medium to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . all cultures were then transferred to sd n medium . yeast whole cell lysates were prepared as previously described and subjected to polyacrylamide _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and analyzed by immunoblotting using an anti myc antibody or anti _PROTEIN_ and anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies . leaves were chopped in _PROTEIN_ extraction buffer using a razor and were then filtered through four layers of cheesecloth and centrifuged at for min to remove cell debris . the supernatant was centrifuged at for min to generate the _LOCATION_ fraction _PROTEIN_ . the resulting supernatant was then centrifuged at for h to generate the _LOCATION_ fraction _PROTEIN_ and the soluble fraction _PROTEIN_ . pellets were resuspended in extraction buffer and fractions were subjected to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and immunoblot analysis using purified anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies . for solubilization of _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fractions were resuspended in extraction buffer plus m nacl m urea m triton x and doc and incubated on ice for h. samples were then centrifuged at for h to separate soluble from insoluble fractions . the pellets were resuspended in _PROTEIN_ sample buffer . the supernatants were precipitated using tca and the protein pellets were washed in acetone and resuspended in _PROTEIN_ sample buffer . samples were analyzed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and immunoblotting with purified anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies . the full length orf of _PROTEIN_ and with bamhi sites at both ends were amplified by pcr and fused to the c terminus of the orf of _METHOD_ in pezs cl plasmids . primers used are as follows each designed to introduce a bamhi site for _PROTEIN_ cgcggatcccaatggctaagagttccttc and cgcggatcctcaagcaacggtaagagatccaa for _PROTEIN_ cgcggatccagatgaataaaggaagcatctttaagatgg and cgcggatccttagattgaagaagcaccgaatgtg for _PROTEIN_ cgcggatccagatgaaatcgttcaaggaacaatac and cgcggatcctcaaccaaaggttttctcactgc . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ a plasmids were produced by site directed mutagenesis using the above wild type _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plasmids as templates . primers used are as follows for _PROTEIN_ a gagagaacacttttgcatctcttaccgttgc and gcaacggtaagagatgcaaaagtgttctctc for _PROTEIN_ a ggcgagaacacattcgctgcttcttcaatcta and tagattgaagaagcagcgaatgtgttctcgcc for _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ and cggtggatcctcaagcaaaggttttctcac . a pezs cl plasmid containing _METHOD_ alone was used as a control . transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ fused _PROTEIN_ proteins in a suspension of arabidopsis cultured cells was performed by a method described previously . for nitrogen starvation transformed cells were transferred to _METHOD_ n medium supplemented with m mannitol and incubated under gentle agitation at for h in the dark . transformed cells were observed with a _METHOD_ microscope . the _PROTEIN_ plant was isolated from an arabidopsis t dna mutagenized population created at the university of wisconsin arabidopsis knockout facility using a pcr based reverse genetic screen . the _PROTEIN_ plant was isolated using the t dna insertion line screening system engineered at the kazusa dna research institute as described previously . the primers used to detect t dna insertions into the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes are as follows for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ specific primers were _PROTEIN_ and tcagagcatttgccagtcatcttcac and the t dna specific primers were cattttataataacgctgcggacatctac and tttctccatattgaccatcatactcattg . for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ specific primers were _PROTEIN_ and cggaattcgttgtatttggtgcttaatga and the t dna specific primers were tagatccgaaactatcagtg and _PROTEIN_ . dna sequencing of pcr amplified fragments carrying the t dna genome junctions determined the position of the t dna insertion in each gene . to construct plasmids for generating stable transformants constitutively _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins plasmids that transiently _PROTEIN_ each _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein under control of a promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus and octopine synthase terminator were digested with noti and blunt end ligated into the smai site of pcambia . a pegad plasmid containing _METHOD_ alone was used as control . to construct the plasmid for complementation of the _PROTEIN_ mutant a bp genomic fragment containing a kb sequence upstream from the start codon and the _PROTEIN_ coding region was amplified by pcr using a primer set cggggtacctctgcaacctacagccccacaatggcagtc and cggggtaccctctactcttccattttcgcatgcttc designed to introduce a kpni site into both ends . the fragment was digested with kpni and then cloned into the kpni site of the vector resulting in the construct . these constructs were verified by sequencing and introduced into wild type and/or _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis plants by the floral dip method of in planta agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation . transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ the transgene were selected on _METHOD_ medium without sucrose containing of kanamycin . at least five independent transgenic plants were obtained and representative data are shown in figures and . primary roots of transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ grown on _METHOD_ medium for week were cut and mounted in water for microscopic observation . for nitrogen starved conditions transgenic plants grown on _METHOD_ medium for week were transferred to _METHOD_ n medium for an additional d in the dark and then observed . the subcellular localization of _METHOD_ fusion proteins was analyzed with a zeiss lsm confocal laser scanning microscope using a nm arkr laser in combination with a to nm band pass filter set . image acquisition and processing were performed using a zeiss laser scanning microscope and adobe photoshop _METHOD_ . primary roots of wild type _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ plants vertically grown on _METHOD_ medium for week were cut and then incubated in _METHOD_ n liquid medium containing concanamycin a under gentle agitation at for to h in the dark . the roots were mounted in water and observed by conventional transmission light microscopy . primary roots of transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were also treated with concanamycin a as described above and observed by _METHOD_ microscopy . the root tips of wild type and _PROTEIN_ primary roots treated with concanamycin a were fixed in a m cacodylate buffer containing glutaraldehyde for h in an ice bath . the specimens were rinsed in the same buffer and postfixed in osmium tetroxide for h in an ice bath . dehydrated specimens were embedded in epoxy resin . ultrathin sections were made with an lkb ultramicrotome using a diamond knife and mounted on mesh copper grids . sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate . the sections were observed with a jem transmission electron microscope operating at kv . phenotypic analyses were performed as described previously except for examination of root elongation under nitrogen starved conditions . for measurement of root elongation under nitrogen starved conditions wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant seeds were sowed on _METHOD_ n medium and then after d primary root length number of _PROTEIN_ roots and total length of _PROTEIN_ roots were counted using _PROTEIN_ image .
