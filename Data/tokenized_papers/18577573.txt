_PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of arabidopsis thaliana is a microtubule associated protein containing multiple heat repeats that are found only in the plant lineage . we show that _PROTEIN_ and their closest arabidopsis homolog are _PROTEIN_ in various tissues with partially overlapping patterns and _PROTEIN_ double mutants exhibit enhanced right handed helical growth . fusion to green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of the native regulatory elements showed that both _PROTEIN_ and were localized to cortical microtubules _PROTEIN_ in particles of various sizes . along the microtubule the _METHOD_ fused _METHOD_ also distributed partly at the plus ends . in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background cortical microtubules were less dynamic and the pause state in which microtubules undergo neither growth nor shrinkage increased at the plus ends . the continuous plus end tracking of _METHOD_ was occasionally interrupted in the mutant cells . recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein promoted microtubule polymerization and bound to microtubules with an n terminal segment that contained two heat repeats as well as to those with a c terminal region . in vitro analyses of microtubule dynamics revealed that _PROTEIN_ and suppressed the pause state at microtubule ends thereby leading to enhanced microtubule growth . we propose that the _PROTEIN_ family proteins act on the pause state to facilitate a transition to microtubule growth .
the arabidopsis genome possesses one close homolog of _PROTEIN_ referred to here as _PROTEIN_ like . _PROTEIN_ and both contain an n terminal ser/thr rich region and nine recognizable heat repeat motifs and exhibit overall amino acid identity of to each other . to compare the levels and patterns of _PROTEIN_ and gene _PROTEIN_ we first conducted an reverse transcriptase pcr based analysis using a common primer set . the pcr primers hybridize to the sequences strictly conserved in the coding regions of these genes and amplify a bp _PROTEIN_ cdna fragment and an bp cdna fragment that can be distinguished from the amplification products from the genomic regions . thus the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ and were directly compared after separation of the respective cdna fragments on agarose gels . _PROTEIN_ and were _PROTEIN_ in all the tissues examined with the strongest _PROTEIN_ in the inflorescence . in all tissues _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ more strongly than . to explore the tissue and cell type _PROTEIN_ patterns further tandem copies of _METHOD_ were inserted at the end of the coding sequences of the _PROTEIN_ and genomic dna regions and were _PROTEIN_ in transgenic arabidopsis plants under control of their native cis regulatory sequences . when several independent transgenic lines were examined _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ much stronger _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants than in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals were detected in all tissue types examined but were considerably stronger in the root tips and the shoot meristem . _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ at low levels in various cell types whereas intense _PROTEIN_ was seen at the hydathodes in cotyledons and relatively strong signals were detected in root hairs . the genevestigator organ specific _PROTEIN_ profile database indicates that _PROTEIN_ transcripts are present at relatively high levels in all organs whereas the levels of transcripts are generally low but considerably abundant in root hair cells and pollen . these microarray based _PROTEIN_ profiles are thus consistent with our rt pcr and promoter _PROTEIN_ based analyses and we conclude that _PROTEIN_ and are _PROTEIN_ in almost all plant tissues in generally overlapping patterns and that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is stronger than _PROTEIN_ . to reveal possible functional redundancy we examined phenotypes of transferred dna insertion alleles of and their double mutants in combination with _PROTEIN_ . we identified three mutant alleles in the _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion pools among which and did not _PROTEIN_ full length transcripts . the two mutants were indistinguishable from the wild type in growth and morphology . these two alleles were then crossed to two _PROTEIN_ alleles in the same ecotype . right handed twisting of petioles in _PROTEIN_ was highly enhanced in the double mutants the petioles of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ rotated around the petiole axis roughly degrees and degrees respectively whereas the petioles of the double mutant between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ skewed further to degrees and degrees . inflorescence of the double mutants twined up a support in a right handed helix a phenotype not observed in either single mutants . the _PROTEIN_ double mutant roots grew slightly towards the right side of the agar plates . although _PROTEIN_ and are _PROTEIN_ in root hairs we observed no root hair phenotype in single and double mutants . these phenotypic analyses of single and double mutants indicate that mutations in enhance the right handed twisting phenotype of _PROTEIN_ . when was _PROTEIN_ under the control of the camv promoter in _PROTEIN_ the resulting transgenic plants grew like wild type plants without a skewing phenotype in the leaf petiole and in the root . therefore can complement the loss of _PROTEIN_ function when _PROTEIN_ strongly . in summary _PROTEIN_ and have similar and overlapping functions in the regulation of anisotropic growth . previous studies have shown that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein labeled microtubules in the cortical array preprophase band metaphase spindle and phragmoplast when stably overexpressed under the control of the camv promoter in transgenic arabidopsis plants and tobacco by cells . in this study native cis regulatory sequences were used to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ so that the precise subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ and at the endogenous _PROTEIN_ level may be revealed . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in its genomic context complemented the _PROTEIN_ mutant whereas _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in its genomic region ameliorated the twisting phenotype of _PROTEIN_ to the level of the _PROTEIN_ single mutant . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ are functional . both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ labeled cortical microtubule array in all the cells where the transgenes were _PROTEIN_ . in many cell types the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in punctate patterns of various sizes that aligned on the microtubule lattice . these distinct _METHOD_ particles appeared to be aggregates or oligomers of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the intersections of two crossing microtubules are often labeled more intensely than neighboring regions . in hypocotyl epidermal cells we observed events in which _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ particles were picked up by the shrinking microtubule end causing an increase in _METHOD_ signal at the microtubule end as the shrinkage continued . when one motile particle encountered another on the same microtubule they yielded an enhanced _METHOD_ signal . also one particle did sometimes divide into two smaller ones . such merging and fission of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ particles may explain the observed variation in size . the _METHOD_ fused proteins also faintly labeled the entire length of microtubules indicating that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins have weak affinity for the microtubule lattice . a concentration of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals was sometimes observed at the plus ends of microtubules . interestingly the _METHOD_ signals appeared to be concentrated not only on the growing end but also on the shrinking end . guard cells of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants contained few large _METHOD_ foci but had cortical arrays decorated along their length with the fusion protein . there _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulated at the plus end of microtubules that grew outward from the inner face of the guard cells although the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at the growing plus end was not as extensive as that of _METHOD_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ has weaker affinity for the microtubule ends than . it has been shown that the distribution of cortical microtubules was biased toward left handed arrays in hypocotyl epidermal cells with tortifolia an allele of _PROTEIN_ compared with wild type microtubules . to test whether alterations of microtubule dynamics underlie the observed shift in distribution we monitored cortical microtubules beneath the outer epidermal walls of hypocotyls and petioles by using _METHOD_ tagged tubulin _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the rather mild defect in the organization of tortifolia microtubules prompted us to compare the microtubule status in four samples wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ double mutants and a transgenic plant line in which overexpressed _PROTEIN_ complemented the _PROTEIN_ phenotype _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in both day old and day old wild type hypocotyls microtubule orientations were distributed over a broad range from transverse to oblique angles . we did not observe a bimodal distribution consisting of two distinct populations of left and right handed arrays in the day old wild type hypocotyls as reported by buschmann et al . . rotary movements of cortical microtubule arrays reported in arabidopsis hypocotyl epidermal cells might underlie this discrepancy . in _PROTEIN_ hypocotyls microtubule orientations were still distributed broadly but the average angles of microtubule arrays were shifted toward left handed orientations . analysis of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ line revealed that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ complemented this moderate defect in microtubule orientations of _PROTEIN_ . moreover the _PROTEIN_ double mutant showed a considerably sharper distribution of microtubule orientations which were biased toward left handed arrays . similar analyses of microtubule orientations in the epidermal cells of day old petioles further confirmed our observation that the lack of _PROTEIN_ biases microtubule orientations toward left handed arrays . we next monitored the dynamic plus end of cortical microtubules in the epidermal cells of hypocotyls and calculated the velocities of growth and shrinkage frequencies of phase transition between growth shrinkage and pause and the total time spent in these three phases . since plant microtubules exhibit dynamic behavior far more often than animal microtubules pauses in our in vivo studies were defined as a state during which a growth rate of less than continued for more than seconds . this minimum period in the pause definition is shorter than the values generally used for animal studies and thus our pauses include mini pauses . most of the dynamics parameters of wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were not remarkably different . microtubule dynamicity a composite measurement of all the tubulin dimers gained or lost per unit time was statistically indistinguishable among the four samples as well . however statistically significant difference was observed between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the time spent in the pause state . the plus end of microtubules in _PROTEIN_ cells spent considerably more time in the stationary pausing state than did that of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells whereas the wild type and _PROTEIN_ values were in between the two . to categorize the paused state more precisely we took into account the previous history of microtubules to see whether a growing or shrinking microtubule resulted in the pause . this analysis revealed that during the growth phase microtubules of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ tend to be halted in pauses compared with growing microtubules of wild type and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to further evaluate the plus end state of microtubules in planta we monitored the dynamics of _METHOD_ which continuously tracked the plus end of polymerizing microtubules as comets . in epidermal cells of wild type hypocotyls the trajectory of _METHOD_ generally followed a largely straight path . occasionally a growing microtubule changed its path abruptly to a new direction at a shallow angle probably reflecting a collision event with another microtubule and subsequent incorporation into a microtubule bundle . the kymographs of such curved trajectories of _METHOD_ showed uninterrupted linear tracks without gaps indicating that growing microtubules were not stalled by the microtubule microtubule collision events . in contrast _METHOD_ comets in _PROTEIN_ cells frequently deviated from a linear trajectory and the abrupt curving events occurred multiple times during the life of a single microtubule . another notable feature of _METHOD_ dynamics in _PROTEIN_ cells was that the labeled microtubule ends frequently stalled for several seconds and then started to track a new growth path again at the previous velocity . this irregular movement of _METHOD_ in the absence of _PROTEIN_ was typically shown in the kymographs where the linear trajectory of _METHOD_ was interrupted by vertical gaps of several seconds . _METHOD_ was partly retained at the stalled plus end especially at the beginning of the pause . not only did the frequency of pauses increase but longer pauses of seconds or more were almost only observed in _PROTEIN_ cells . some of the abrupt changes in the _METHOD_ trajectory occurred during the paused state but other turns happened during continuous growth as seen in wild type cells . when the growth velocity of the plus end was measured with the aid of _METHOD_ in epidermal cells of hypocotyl and petiole the distribution in _PROTEIN_ cells was slightly shifted toward slower growth rates as seen in the greater proportion of slowly growing microtubules compared with the wild type distribution . notably the plus end in _PROTEIN_ cells spent about of the growth phase in the paused state in wild type cells the paused state accounted for less than of the total life of plus ends . we conclude that _PROTEIN_ secures uninterrupted growth at the plus end of cortical microtubules in plant cells . altered microtubule behavior in the _PROTEIN_ mutant suggests that _PROTEIN_ protein modulate microtubule functions directly . to test this possibility we analyzed the effects of recombinant _PROTEIN_ and proteins on the microtubule dynamics in vitro . was included in the in vitro assay because it has a redundant and similar function to _PROTEIN_ as shown above and because recombinant bound to taxol stabilized microtubules in vitro . _PROTEIN_ and were produced in e. coli as proteins fused to the trigger _PROTEIN_ which enhanced the solubility of the recombinant proteins and purified to apparent homogeneity . dynamics of microtubules was analyzed by using dark field microscopy and parameters of microtubule dynamics were quantified for both plus and minus ends . in our in vitro assay we set the incubation temperature at instead of the usually used . at this lower temperature dynamic instability was moderately reduced so that otherwise infrequent pauses could be observed more readily . in this in vitro assay a microtubule growth state during which a growth rate of less than continued for more than seconds was counted as a pause . when supplied at or tf _PROTEIN_ and tf did not considerably affect velocities of growth and shrinkage of the plus end whereas transition frequencies from growth to pause and from shrinkage to pause tended to be suppressed . these changes in dynamicity manifest in a _PROTEIN_ total period spent in pauses and an increased time spent in the growth phase . the reduced pausing time contributed to a moderate increase in dynamicity at the plus end . statistical significance however was assigned only to a few parameters due to high intrinsic variability among the dynamics of individual microtubules . at the minus end tf _PROTEIN_ and tf also showed a tendency to suppress pauses and to increase the time spent in growth although the values of dynamics were not so affected . overall recombinant _PROTEIN_ and proteins _METHOD_ promoted microtubule dynamicity by suppressing the paused state and prolonging the growth duration . we confirmed the polymerization promoting activity of _PROTEIN_ by using a turbidity assay . tf _PROTEIN_ at significantly promoted the formation of microtubule polymers from the tubulin solution at compared with the tf control at the same concentration . both _PROTEIN_ and contain an n terminal ser/thr rich region and nine predictable heat repeat motifs which are clustered in the n terminal half of the protein . to identify microtubule binding region we _PROTEIN_ various _PROTEIN_ fragments fused to thioredoxine and polyhistidine in e. coli and purified them to near homogeneity . the n terminal region containing the ser/thr rich region and the first seven heat motifs _PROTEIN_ and the c terminal region containing the eighth and ninth heat motifs _PROTEIN_ bound taxol stabilized microtubules almost as efficiently as the full length _PROTEIN_ but the middle region _PROTEIN_ did not . the fusion of these fragments to glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ gave the same results although microtubule binding _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed considerable microtubule bundling activity probably due to the artificial dimerization caused by _PROTEIN_ . on testing smaller fragments of the n terminal _PROTEIN_ region we narrowed down the moderate microtubule binding activity to a fragment only consisting of the fourth and fifth heat motifs _PROTEIN_ . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ contains at least two distinct microtubule binding regions and that a tandem repeat of two _PROTEIN_ heat motifs possesses significant affinity for microtubule polymers . when the n terminal middle and c terminal regions _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were fused to the n terminus of _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ stably under the control of the camv promoter in tobacco by cells the fusion proteins did not label cortical microtubules . the same constructs did not complement the twisting phenotype of _PROTEIN_ either . these results suggest that efficient in vivo localization to cortical microtubules and microtubule regulating function require a nearly full length _PROTEIN_ protein .
