in land plant chloroplasts the grana play multiple roles in photosynthesis including the potential increase of photosynthetic capacity in light and enhancement of photochemical efficiency in shade . however the molecular _METHOD_ of grana formation remain elusive . here we report a novel gene grana deficient _PROTEIN_ required for chloroplast grana formation in arabidopsis . in the chloroplast of knockout mutant _PROTEIN_ only stromal _LOCATION_ were observed and they could not stack together to form appressed grana . the mutant exhibited seedling lethality with pale green cotyledons and true leaves . further blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis indicated that the trimeric _METHOD_ of light harvesting complex ii were scarcely detected in _PROTEIN_ confirming previous reports that the lhcii trimer is essential for grana formation . the _PROTEIN_ protein the major component of the lhciib trimer was substantially reduced and another lhciib trimer component _PROTEIN_ was slightly reduced in the _PROTEIN_ mutant although their transcription levels were not altered in the mutant . this suggests that defective lhcii trimer formation in _PROTEIN_ is due to low amounts of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ encodes a chloroplast protein with an ankyrin domain within the _PROTEIN_ terminus . it was highly _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis green tissues and its _PROTEIN_ was induced by photosignaling pathways . immunoblot analysis of the _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion protein in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants with _METHOD_ antibody indicates that _PROTEIN_ is associated with an approximately kd _LOCATION_ protein complex instead of the lhcii trimer . this shows that _PROTEIN_ may play an indirect role in lhcii trimerization during grana formation .
we screened young seedlings to isolate novel genes required for chloroplast biogenesis and identified a pale green mutant named _PROTEIN_ from a collection of t dna insertion lines . the _PROTEIN_ mutants can survive for approximately to weeks with a pale green phenotype when germinated on soil . the pale coloration was observed throughout the life of the mutant and uniformly affected all the aerial tissues . the _PROTEIN_ plants grew much slower than the wild type and growth ceased at the vegetative growth stage before bolting . to establish whether _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ recessive mutant progeny obtained from self pollinated heterozygotes _PROTEIN_ were segregated at a green plants to pale green plants phenotypic ratio of . this ratio was expected for a character inherited as a single recessive mendelian trait . cosegregation of resistance to basta and the pale green phenotype indicated that the pale coloration of the _PROTEIN_ mutant cosegregated with the t dna insertion . to identify the corresponding _PROTEIN_ gene thermal asymmetric interlaced pcr was used to obtain a genomic dna fragment that flanked the left border of t dna . sequencing of the tail pcr products suggested that the t dna is inserted in the only intron of a predicted open reading frame _PROTEIN_ . pcr analysis using t dna and genome specific primers indicated that all mutant plants analyzed were homozygous for the insertion which indicated that _PROTEIN_ was responsible for the _PROTEIN_ pale green phenotype . genetic complementation was subsequently performed to confirm the results . a bp dna fragment which included the genomic sequences of _PROTEIN_ and bp sequences upstream from the initiation codon was cloned from the wild type and introduced into the heterozygous _PROTEIN_ plants . a total of transgenic plants were generated and each exhibited normal morphology . pcr analysis confirmed that two of transgenic plants were homozygous for the _PROTEIN_ mutation . transmission electron microscopy analysis showed that the ultrastructure of the complemented _PROTEIN_ chloroplast resembled that of the wild type . these results verified that _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ and that the bp genomic region was sufficient for _PROTEIN_ function . in addition we obtained another two _PROTEIN_ alleles from the signal collection at the arabidopsis biological resource center _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . pcr analysis confirmed that the t dnas were inserted into the only intron and the last exon of the _PROTEIN_ locus in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ alleles respectively . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ showed similar phenotypes to that of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was examined in the allelic mutant plants using reverse transcription pcr and real time rt pcr analysis with gene specific primers . gene _PROTEIN_ levels in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were and of the wild type respectively . however _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was not detected in _PROTEIN_ . therefore _PROTEIN_ was chosen for further analysis . previous reports demonstrated that leaf coloration mutants are related to chloroplast biogenesis . therefore to determine if the _PROTEIN_ mutation resulted in the chloroplast biogenesis defect the _PROTEIN_ mutant leaf chloroplast ultrastructure was analyzed by transmission electron microscopy . in mature chloroplasts of the wild type plants the internal _LOCATION_ were present as either stroma _LOCATION_ or stacked grana _LOCATION_ . in _PROTEIN_ chloroplasts only stromal _LOCATION_ were observed they could not stack together to form appressed grana . typical grana were not detected in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants in which the unstacked _LOCATION_ lamella resembled _PROTEIN_ . these results indicated that the _PROTEIN_ protein is essential for the formation of stacked grana . the pale green phenotype suggested that major pigment levels in the mutant were reduced . therefore we measured the concentration of chlorophylls in the leaves of mutant and wild type plants . the total chlorophyll content of the week old wild type leaves was fresh weight while the total chlorophyll content in _PROTEIN_ was reduced by approximately with only fresh weight . however the chlorophyll a/b ratio was increased from in the wild type to in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . this indicated that the high chlorophyll a/b ratio primarily resulted from a more substantial reduction of chlorophyll b in the mutant . total chlorophylls were obtained from mg of fresh tissue from week old arabidopsis basal rosette leaves using acetone . spectrophotometric quantification was carried out and then the ratio of chlorophyll a to chlorophyll b was calculated . values shown are fresh weight . psii and lhcii are _PROTEIN_ located in the appressed granal domain . psii activity in the grana deficient _PROTEIN_ mutant was analyzed by measuring the ratio of variable _METHOD_ to maximum _METHOD_ as follows fv/fm /fm where fo and fm are minimum and maximum chlorophyll a _METHOD_ of dark _PROTEIN_ leaves respectively . fv/fm reflects the maximum potential capacity of the psii photochemical reactions . the fv/fm value of week old leaves was in wild type plants and the _PROTEIN_ value was . despite the _PROTEIN_ that the fv/fm value was very close for the wild type and the mutant the fo and fm in the mutant were dramatically lower than in the wild type . this demonstrates that the photochemical efficiency of psii was not affected by the mutation in _PROTEIN_ . the effects of grana deficiency on protein complexes embedded in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were examined . the chlorophyll protein complexes were solubilized from _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ using dodecyl d maltopyranoside and separated by blue native _PROTEIN_ . after the first dimensional separation in the presence of _METHOD_ brilliant blue g the major bands representing psii supercomplexes monomeric psi and dimeric psii monomeric psii dimeric cytochrome trimeric lhcii and monomeric lhcii were resolved in the wild type . most of the bands were also detected in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . however the trimeric lhcii was negligible and band i of the wild type disappeared in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . in the grana of higher plants the lhcii trimer is composed of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in a ratio of approximately . the steady state levels of lhcii proteins were examined by immunoblot analyses performed with antibodies raised against specific subunits of lhciib and one other minor monomeric _PROTEIN_ protein . the results showed that _PROTEIN_ levels were substantially reduced and _PROTEIN_ was slightly reduced in _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ accumulated at the same level between the mutant and the wild type . we further investigated lhciib and _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ at the transcriptional level by rt pcr . the results demonstrated no differences on transcription level between the _PROTEIN_ mutant and the wild type . therefore the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was affected by the _PROTEIN_ mutation . we also characterized the subunits of psii psi cytochrome and _PROTEIN_ synthase complexes in the mutant . in the _PROTEIN_ mutant the and core subunits of psii accumulated to low levels while the _PROTEIN_ subunit of psi the cytochrome f subunit of cytochrome and the subunit of _PROTEIN_ synthase accumulated to similar levels as the wild type . these results suggested that psii was severely impaired by the _PROTEIN_ mutation and grana deficiency . to verify the _PROTEIN_ gene primary structure its full genomic dna and cdna were cloned and sequenced . the _PROTEIN_ gene genomic structure was bp in length and was composed of two exons and one intron which is consistent with the arabidopsis information resource gene predictions . the cdna we cloned from seedlings is identical to the cdna in the arabidopsis information resource database . the _PROTEIN_ mrna encodes an unknown protein of amino acids with a putative molecular _METHOD_ of kd . domain analysis indicated that the _PROTEIN_ protein is an ankyrin domain containing protein . this domain exhibits conservation of the consensus motif in arabidopsis with identity . this is congruent with to of those observed among hundreds of ankyrin repeats . blastp search showed that the homologs of the _PROTEIN_ protein were also present in various plant species including castor poplar grape soybean rice sorghum maize moss and green algae . for example the homolog from poplar shared the highest identity and similarity with _PROTEIN_ and the homolog from grape _PROTEIN_ shared an identity of and similarity of with _PROTEIN_ . was used to perform an alignment with these protein sequences . phylogenetic analysis indicated that _PROTEIN_ formed a basal clade within the dicotyledons . these results indicated that _PROTEIN_ was conserved in the evolutionary process and its putative homologs were present in various chloroplast containing _METHOD_ including unicellular green algae and mosses . targetp program analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ is a chloroplast targeted protein . the subcellular localization of the protein was confirmed by fusing the full length coding sequence of _PROTEIN_ with the _METHOD_ gene and introduced into wild type plants under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . stable transgenic plants were obtained and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of transgenic plants was observed with confocal laser microscopy . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was colocalized with chlorophyll _METHOD_ . this confirmed that _PROTEIN_ is a chloroplast localized protein . to further determine the localization of _PROTEIN_ within the chloroplast we investigated the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants with _METHOD_ antibody . a positive signal was detected in the total proteins and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants . to understand which complex _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ might be associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein complexes of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants were separated by bn _PROTEIN_ denatured on the gel and directly used for two dimensional _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . immunoblot analysis indicated that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was associated with a complex of approximately kd _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . there are two bands of about kd in the wild type however only one band is present in the mutant . this indicates that the _PROTEIN_ might be associated with the approximately kd protein complex that is absent in the mutant . _PROTEIN_ data from genevestigator showed that _PROTEIN_ was widely _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis green tissues . therefore northern blot analysis was performed to confirm these data . the results showed that _PROTEIN_ was highly _PROTEIN_ in leaves and seedlings however it was weakly _PROTEIN_ in roots . this result was consistent with the microarray data . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ patterns in arabidopsis were also investigated using a gus reporter gene fused to its promoter . the observed patterns suggested that _PROTEIN_ was not _PROTEIN_ in germinating seeds . in d old seedlings gus activity was detected in the basal rosette leaves but not in the roots . gus staining was also observed in the _METHOD_ and siliques but not in mature seeds . in the flower gus activity was detected in the sepals stamens and styles but not in the _PROTEIN_ . gus staining for transgenic lines showed that _PROTEIN_ was only _PROTEIN_ in green tissues containing chloroplasts which was consistent with its putative roles in chloroplast grana formation . in addition we examined the effect of light on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . real time rt pcr analysis was carried out using total rna isolated from leaves harvested at or h after the transfer of d old dark grown wild type plants to light conditions . _PROTEIN_ was weakly _PROTEIN_ in the dark but after transfer of etiolated plants to light conditions _PROTEIN_ mrna accumulated in a time dependent manner . this result suggests that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is induced by photosignaling pathways .

complementation was achieved as follows a dna fragment of bp including an bp upstream sequence and a bp downstream sequence was amplified using la taq polymerase _PROTEIN_ . following sequence verification the fragment was cloned into the binary vector and introduced into heterozygous plants using the infiltration method by agrobacterium tumefaciens strain . the transformants were selected on plant nutrition solution culture medium with mg hygromycin and screened for green phenotype plants with a homozygous background . the homozygous background could be verified because the lp/rp amplified sequences are included in the complementation fragment and primer sets were used as follows primers were used to validate the existence of a t dna insertion in _PROTEIN_ lp/rp primers were used to detect either the _PROTEIN_ genomic sequence or a transgenic complementation fragment and genome specific primers ci f/ci r were used to validate the homozygous background . the ci r primer was designed bp downstream of the cmp r primer consequently pcr with the ci f/ci r primer set was not able to amplify a bp fragment in homozygous plants even if the complementation fragment was
