we have established a protocol for the isolation of highly purified _LOCATION_ from mature arabidopsis thaliana leaves and analyzed the proteome by complementary gel based and gel free approaches . seventy eight nonredundant proteins were identified of which novel proteins had previously not been associated with plant _LOCATION_ . seventeen novel proteins carried predicted peroxisomal targeting signals _PROTEIN_ type or type proteins contained _PROTEIN_ related peptides . _LOCATION_ targeting was supported for many novel proteins by in silico analyses and confirmed for representative full length fusion proteins by _METHOD_ microscopy . the targeting function of predicted and unpredicted signals was investigated and ssl > ssi > and asl > were established as novel functional _PROTEIN_ peptides . in contrast with the generally accepted confinement of _PROTEIN_ peptides to the n terminal domain the bifunctional transthyretin like protein was demonstrated to carry internally a functional _PROTEIN_ . the novel enzymes include numerous enoyl coa hydratases short chain dehydrogenases and several enzymes involved in nadp and glutathione metabolism . seven proteins including _PROTEIN_ and myrosinases support the currently emerging evidence for an important role of leaf _LOCATION_ in defense against pathogens and herbivores . the data provide new insights into the biology of plant _LOCATION_ and improve the prediction accuracy of _LOCATION_ targeted proteins from genome sequences .
to identify plant specific peroxisomal proteins by a large scale proteomics approach a new isolation method for leaf _LOCATION_ from arabidopsis was established with the objectives of increasing the stability of _LOCATION_ in aqueous solution reducing the physical interaction of _LOCATION_ with mitochondria and chloroplasts a pronounced phenomenon in brassicaceae and increasing the specificity of _LOCATION_ enrichment by a combination of percoll and sucrose density gradient centrifugation . to this end to week old plants were harvested at the end of the dark period and gently ground in a buffer of high osmolarity . after separation of intact chloroplasts but notably without _LOCATION_ sedimentation by differential centrifugation the supernatant was laid directly on top of a discontinuous percoll density gradient . cosedimentation of _LOCATION_ along with mitochondria and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ by differential centrifugation prior to isopycnic organelle separation increased irreversibly interorganellar adhesion and _LOCATION_ contamination . whereas chloroplasts _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and mitochondria were largely retained in the and percoll fraction near the top of the gradient intact leaf _LOCATION_ passed the percoll layer and were recovered at the bottom visible as a whitish diffuse organelle sediment . _LOCATION_ fractions of several percoll gradients were combined and washed in tricine/edta buffer containing sucrose . approximately of total activity of the leaf peroxisomal marker enzyme hydroxypyruvate reductase _PROTEIN_ of the crude extract was recovered in the first fraction of leaf _LOCATION_ with a yield of nkat _PROTEIN_ per g fresh weight . the _LOCATION_ fraction was carefully homogenized and laid on top of a discontinuous sucrose density gradient . after ultracentrifugation intact leaf _LOCATION_ were enriched close to the bottom of the gradient visible as a sharp white band at the typical density of plant _LOCATION_ of to sucrose . even though only half of the _LOCATION_ could be recovered the contamination by chloroplasts and mitochondria was further reduced by a _PROTEIN_ of three . on average protein were obtained with a specific _PROTEIN_ activity of nkat/mg protein . the purity of leaf _LOCATION_ was high as determined by the activities of marker enzymes for leaf _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ mitochondria and chloroplasts and the content of chlorophyll _LOCATION_ contaminating chloroplasts and mitochondria were estimated to comprise only and of the total respectively . biochemical analysis of _LOCATION_ purity _LOCATION_ fractions of highest purity _PROTEIN_ were analyzed by de to display the proteinaceous constituents of arabidopsis leaf _LOCATION_ as maps of intact proteins . upon gel staining with colloidal _METHOD_ blue separated protein spots were visualized out of which were identified with high confidence by peptide _METHOD_ and fragment fingerprinting using an automated platform based on _PROTEIN_ assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . summarized over several two dimensional gels in addition to known plant peroxisomal proteins proteins were identified that had previously not been associated experimentally with plant _LOCATION_ and are referred to as novel proteins throughout this study . with respect to _LOCATION_ purity few minor spots derived from dominant proteins of chloroplasts and mitochondria . for instance the presence of the large and small subunits of ribulose bisphosphate _PROTEIN_ the most abundant plant protein and small subunits of the _METHOD_ indicated a low contamination with chloroplasts . similarly a few tiny protein spots represented mitochondrial proteins including the p and h subunits of gly decarboxylase which is the most prominent mitochondrial protein subunit of the _PROTEIN_ synthase complex _PROTEIN_ and ser hydroxymethyltransferase . by contrast no dominant proteins were detected of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ the _LOCATION_ the _LOCATION_ or tonoplast _LOCATION_ or the _LOCATION_ . likewise major _LOCATION_ proteins were not found except for two spots identified as _LOCATION_ glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase subunit c and aconitase . based on the staining intensity of leaf peroxisomal versus nonperoxisomal protein spots we concluded that leaf _LOCATION_ were isolated at purity with a minor contamination by dominant proteins from mitochondria and chloroplasts but not by other subcellular compartments . although two dimensional gel based proteomics approaches offer the advantage that protein integrity and information on protein abundance isoform identity and posttranslational modifications are retained limitations with respect to the identification of small basic and hydrophobic proteins are reported . to complement the gel based approach and improve coverage of the peroxisomal proteome a gel free technique was added that employs one dimensional lc separation at the level of proteolytic peptides commonly referred to as the shotgun approach . this technique is very sensitive and requires only small amounts of total protein as demonstrated recently by cell specific protein profiling in pooled trichome and epidermis cells from arabidopsis . the proteins identified by this method largely overlapped with those of the gel based approach however additionally eight known and six novel proteins were detected only by the shotgun strategy . these proteins generally had either a basic isoelectric point and/or were small proteins underscoring the complementary nature of the two approaches applied . in total we identified nonredundant proteins comprising known and novel proteins . filtered _METHOD_ spectra for protein identifications are stored in promex a _METHOD_ spectral reference library for plant proteomics that can be searched with peptide product ion spectra of unknown samples . novel proteins identified in arabidopsis leaf _LOCATION_ identified proteins already known as constituents of leaf _LOCATION_ or glyoxysomes in any plant species are listed in supplemental table online . as valuable information on protein abundance could be deduced from the two dimensional gels a few selected proteins are described in more detail here . consistent with the major function of leaf _LOCATION_ in glycolate recycling the most prominent protein spots on the two dimensional gels represented the enzymes involved in the photorespiratory _PROTEIN_ cycle all of which were identified . on the basis of the _METHOD_ data closely related _METHOD_ of high sequence similarity could often be distinguished allowing conclusions on isoform _PROTEIN_ and predominance in mature leaves . for instance both _METHOD_ of glycolate oxidase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were specifically identified . of the two _METHOD_ each of glu glyoxylate aminotransferase and peroxisomal malate dehydrogenase _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ dominated over the second isoform both of which were identified as well and are thus not restricted to nonphotosynthetic tissue . catalase isoform _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was more prominent on the two dimensional gel than _PROTEIN_ even though these _METHOD_ could hardly be separated by isoelectric focusing . _PROTEIN_ was below the detection limit of the gel based method but was identified by the shotgun method . three further antioxidative enzymes were identified as well . even though fatty acid oxidation is primarily performed by glyoxysomes of germinating seeds and is thought to play only a minor role in leaves we detected not only a complete set of the core oxidation enzymes but also several auxiliary enzymes in leaf _LOCATION_ . the core oxidation enzymes included long chain acyl coa synthetase isoform _PROTEIN_ acyl coa oxidase isoform _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ both arabidopsis _METHOD_ of multifunctional protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and abnormal _METHOD_ meristem _PROTEIN_ and all three thiolase _METHOD_ . _LOCATION_ defective _PROTEIN_ and peroxisomal keto thiolase isoform _PROTEIN_ predominated on two dimensional gels whereas _PROTEIN_ was identified only by the shotgun approach . the auxiliary enzymes of fatty acid oxidation included dienoyl coa isomerase _PROTEIN_ enoyl coa hydratase isoform _PROTEIN_ sterol carrier protein isoform _PROTEIN_ and acyl coa thioesterase _PROTEIN_ . with respect to hormone biosynthesis not only _PROTEIN_ but also oxo cyclopentane octanoic acid coa ligase _PROTEIN_ which activates opc was detected . _PROTEIN_ was represented by a low abundance protein spot restricted to _LOCATION_ of highest purity consistent with its low _PROTEIN_ level under standard conditions and its induction by wounding . two further acyl coa acitivating enzymes included _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and coumarate coa ligase like protein _PROTEIN_ . in agreement with the heat inducibility of one of the two shsps from plant _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ only the constitutively _PROTEIN_ isoform _PROTEIN_ px was identified . as peroxisomal _LOCATION_ were not further enriched prior to proteome analysis the number of integral _LOCATION_ proteins identified was low _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which is consistent with the low content of _LOCATION_ proteins in _LOCATION_ in general . in summary the known plant peroxisomal proteins identified in isolated leaf _LOCATION_ included all soluble enzymes involved in photorespiration ros metabolism and ja biosynthesis . the detection of many core and auxiliary enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation and sulfur and nitrogen metabolism indicated that the dynamic range of protein identification was sufficiently high to cover low abundance enzymes that are predominantly _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ variants other than leaf _LOCATION_ and that oxidation related enzymes may play a yet underestimated role in leaf peroxisomal metabolism . several _PROTEIN_ enzymes although encoded by single arabidopsis genes often appeared on the two dimensional gels as multiple protein spots arranged in a characteristic horizontal pattern . this pattern was most obvious for highly abundant _PROTEIN_ enzymes namely _PROTEIN_ ser glyoxylate aminotransferase _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but also observed for minor enzymes such as ascorbate peroxidase _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the horizontal spot series of _PROTEIN_ differed slightly in that the differences in pi between spots were smaller . although horizontal spot trains are often seen as artifacts of de the uniform and regular patterns observed here might be indicative of the presence of charge modifying posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation . among the novel proteins a surprisingly large number had annotated functions related to fatty acid oxidation . one protein is a yet uncharacterized isoform of the extended superfamily of acyl activating enzymes namely _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ belonging to clade vi of largely unknown _PROTEIN_ carrying aaes as does _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ the superfamily of enoyl coa hydratases/isomerases _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ being the most prominent enzymes we now identified monofunctional members of plant _LOCATION_ . the first _PROTEIN_ referred to as isoform a _PROTEIN_ belongs to clade vi of putative plant enoyl coa hydratases . two further monofunctional _PROTEIN_ identified namely _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have been grouped in clade iii and are the closest arabidopsis homologs of peroxisomal monofunctional enoyl coa isomerase from fungi and mammals . most intriguing of this enzyme family is _PROTEIN_ annotated as putative naphthoate synthase because the enzyme is plant specific among eukaryotes and represents the arabidopsis homolog of cyanobacterial menb an enoyl coa hydratase involved in _PROTEIN_ biosynthesis . this provides experimental evidence for _LOCATION_ targeting of the single arabidopsis homolog of menb further supported by conservation of the predicted _PROTEIN_ in homologous ests and indicates that _PROTEIN_ biosynthesis is partly compartmentalized in plant _LOCATION_ . one protein spot was identified as a monofunctional hydroxyacyl coa dehydrogenase annotated as hydroxybutyryl coa dehydrogenase and carrying the predicted major _PROTEIN_ tripeptide _PROTEIN_ > . of the experimentally uncharacterized arabidopsis family of small thioesterases _PROTEIN_ with six _PROTEIN_ possessing members the second isoform of clade i _PROTEIN_ is now experimentally associated with plant _LOCATION_ . five novel proteins belong to the superfamily of short chain dehydrogenases/reductases and include four monofunctional sdrs _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and a bifunctional short and medium chain dehydrogenase/reductase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with an n terminal sdr and a c terminal medium chain dehydrogenase/reductase domain of the subgroup of nadph quinone reductases _PROTEIN_ . the latter was identified specifically by the gel free approach . further novel enzymes with predicted catalytic activities related to fatty acid oxidation included epoxide hydrolase isoform and one of two arabidopsis homologs of acetoacetyl coa thiolase _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is a yet unknown isoform that shares identity at the amino acid level with _PROTEIN_ but is predominantly _PROTEIN_ in nonphotosynthetic tissue and presumably plays a role outside of photorespiration . enzymes associated with peroxisomal nadp metabolism included _METHOD_ of nadp dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase _PROTEIN_ and phosphogluconate dehydrogenase one of three enzymes of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway . several novel plant peroxisomal enzymes are predicted to catalyze gsh dependent reactions . these identified proteins included an isoform of glutathione reductase _PROTEIN_ isoform of the extended arabidopsis family of glutathione s transferases _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the single arabidopsis homolog of s glutathione dehydrogenase _PROTEIN_ . seven identified proteins are functionally associated with plant defense _METHOD_ which was rather unexpected . four enzymes are _PROTEIN_ of the superfamily of glycoside hydrolase family many of which are reported to mediate plant defense against herbivores . the _PROTEIN_ included _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the myrosinase homolog thioglucoside _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . all three defense related enzymes were apparently upregulated in leaf _LOCATION_ isolated from senescent plants _PROTEIN_ was specifically identified in the latter . the myrosinase associated protein epithiospecifier _PROTEIN_ which alters _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis and insect resistance was identified in highly purified leaf _LOCATION_ as well . two other defense proteins identified comprised one of three arabidopsis homologs of vertebrate macrophage migration inhibitory _PROTEIN_ and ozone induced protein a plant specific small polypeptide of only residues that is induced by ozone and pathogen attack . likewise unexpected was the identification of proteins with annotated functions related to _LOCATION_ acid metabolism . these six proteins included two gly rich rna binding proteins _PROTEIN_ two dead box rna helicases _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ an unknown rna binding protein _PROTEIN_ and a nucleotide binding protein . except for nbp carrying the _PROTEIN_ like c terminal tripeptide skv > all proteins related to _LOCATION_ acid metabolism lack predicted _PROTEIN_ . proteins with other annotated functions included two enzymes reported to be involved in cys and met biosynthesis . o acetylserine sulfhydrylase is a presumably _LOCATION_ isoform lacking an obvious _PROTEIN_ . isoform of cobalamin _PROTEIN_ independent met synthase carries the _PROTEIN_ related c terminal tripeptide sak > . one of two arabidopsis homologs of betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase was identified as well homologs of which had previously been localized to the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ in monocotyledons . another protein spot _PROTEIN_ was identified as a closely related homolog of a recently crystallized minimal acetyl transferase _PROTEIN_ . the single arabidopsis transthyretin like protein is homologous to mammalian transthyretin a transport protein for vertebrate hormones . interestingly the full length protein contains a predicted _PROTEIN_ outside of the n terminal domain in a linker region that connects two enzymatic domains whereas two alternative splice variants from arabidopsis lack the putative targeting signal . by _METHOD_ sequencing of three tryptic peptides covering major parts of the linker region including the putative _PROTEIN_ the tlp homolog identified in arabidopsis _LOCATION_ was demonstrated to represent the full length protein strengthening the idea that the internal _PROTEIN_ peptide targets full length tlp to _LOCATION_ . lastly four novel proteins lacked annotated domains and sequence similarity with known proteins deposited in the protein databases three of these unknown proteins carried _PROTEIN_ like tripeptides . the majority of the novel proteins found to be associated with leaf _LOCATION_ carried predicted well known _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ related peptides for instance ssl > ssi > asl > sak > or sym > strongly supporting their localization in the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . because the sole presence of a putative _PROTEIN_ peptide is an insufficient criterion to definitely conclude _LOCATION_ targeting we further investigated the predicted targeting function of _PROTEIN_ peptides using both computational and experimental analyses . as part of the computational analyses predicted orthologs of the novel proteins were retrieved from protein and est databases of higher plants and analyzed for conservation of the predicted targeting peptides as outlined previously . most proteins fulfilled the initial requirements for subsequent analysis except for a few proteins that either appeared to be specific to brassicaceae or shared high sequence similarity with other arabidopsis homologs _PROTEIN_ preventing the specific detection of apparent orthologs . on average plant ests were retrieved for each novel protein . except for one est homologous to _PROTEIN_ terminating with frl > the orthologs of nine novel proteins with predicted _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ carried approximately four different c terminal tripeptides each all of which represented major or minor _PROTEIN_ . five other novel proteins had previously been reported to carry conserved _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . likewise the postulated _LOCATION_ targeting function of the _PROTEIN_ related tripeptide ssi > present in _PROTEIN_ was supported by the detection of several homologous ests possessing either minor noncanonical _PROTEIN_ or closely related tripeptides such as _PROTEIN_ > and sni > . in addition most plant homologs of _PROTEIN_ carried a basic residue at position which is reported to enhance _LOCATION_ targeting by weak _PROTEIN_ tripeptides . _PROTEIN_ sdrc only _PROTEIN_ like peptides were present in homologous ests . however the high content of basic amino acid residues and pro in front and the lack of acidic residues in the c terminal tripeptides _METHOD_ were consistent with protein targeting by the _PROTEIN_ pathway . although a dissection of plant homologs of _PROTEIN_ into apparent orthologs of or _PROTEIN_ was difficult many est sequences were found to carry c terminal amino acid extensions either terminating with predicted or novel _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ like tripeptides . _PROTEIN_ novel proteins carrying predicted _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ targeting function of the predicted _PROTEIN_ in naphthoate synthase was well supported by conservation of the nonapeptide as major or minor _PROTEIN_ in plant orthologs . moreover characteristic amino acid residues predicted to act as targeting enhancing elements were present in close proximity to the _PROTEIN_ . likewise the predicted internal _PROTEIN_ of tlp was conserved as putative major or minor _PROTEIN_ in all homologous plant ests spanning this region except for one slightly divergent nonapeptide present in medicago . even though full length tlp variants appear to predominate among plant ests some plant species such as oryza and triticum were found to _PROTEIN_ alternative splice variants similar to arabidopsis that exactly lack this nonapeptide . to experimentally verify protein targeting to _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ targeting function of predicted _PROTEIN_ subcellular targeting of seven representative fusion proteins with _METHOD_ was analyzed by _METHOD_ microscopy upon transient cdna _PROTEIN_ in onion epidermal cells . four proteins carried predicted major _PROTEIN_ peptides _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ whereas three proteins possessed predicted minor _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of lower _LOCATION_ targeting probability . for all proteins subcellular targeting of two constructs was analyzed _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . nadp dependent idh _PROTEIN_ was chosen as one of the proteins carrying predicted major _PROTEIN_ peptides . nadp dependent idh fused at its n terminus with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was indeed detected in punctate structures in onion epidermal cells . in double transformants _PROTEIN_ simultaneously a _LOCATION_ targeted cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ the yellow _METHOD_ subcellular structures were identified conclusively as _LOCATION_ . _METHOD_ extended by the c terminal amino acid residues of idh including the predicted _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ > _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was directed from the _LOCATION_ to punctate structures thereby identifying _PROTEIN_ > as the _PROTEIN_ of peroxisomal idh . two further proteins namely the full length fusion proteins of the predicted _PROTEIN_ homolog _PROTEIN_ and the monofunctional hydroxyacyl coa dehydrogenase hbcdh _PROTEIN_ were targeted to _LOCATION_ as well . _METHOD_ extended by the _PROTEIN_ of these proteins showed a punctate _METHOD_ pattern characterizing the c terminal tripeptides skl > and _PROTEIN_ > as the targeting signals of _PROTEIN_ and hbcdh respectively . _PROTEIN_ proteins carrying predicted minor _PROTEIN_ peptides the fusion protein between _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ one of two predicted homologs of mammalian peci was targeted to punctate structures in onion epidermal cells that coincided with _METHOD_ labeled _LOCATION_ . _METHOD_ extended by the c terminal amino acid residues of _PROTEIN_ including the predicted _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ > _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was directed from the _LOCATION_ to punctate structures thereby identifying the minor _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ > as the _PROTEIN_ of peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ . likewise the isoform _PROTEIN_ with the putative _PROTEIN_ ski > was shown to be located in _LOCATION_ as the yellow _METHOD_ spots coincided with cyan _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ upon _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the transferase was imported into _LOCATION_ via the _PROTEIN_ pathway because attachment of the c terminal amino acid domain of _PROTEIN_ to _METHOD_ showed a punctate pattern of _METHOD_ . the full length protein of the nadph producing dehydrogenase fused to the c terminal end of _METHOD_ was the only full length fusion protein that remained _LOCATION_ for yet unknown reasons . the c terminal amino acid residues of however directed _METHOD_ to punctate subcellular structures that moved along cytoplasmic strands and coincided with _LOCATION_ . although not identified within the proteome analysis subcellular targeting of _PROTEIN_ the precedent enzyme of in the peroxisomal oppp was also investigated using one specific isoform out of five arabidopsis homologs . this enzyme carries both a predicted n terminal transit peptide and a conserved _PROTEIN_ . whereas _METHOD_ was targeted to _LOCATION_ like structures consistent with the presence of a functional n terminal transit peptide the inversely arranged fusion protein _METHOD_ was targeted to _LOCATION_ as was _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with the _PROTEIN_ skl > . these data further strengthen the idea that this isoform is targeted to both _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ in vivo probably regulated by alternative translation . taken together predicted _LOCATION_ targeting of novel proteins identified in isolated leaf _LOCATION_ was experimentally confirmed for five of the six full length candidate proteins and additionally for as a metabolically related enzyme all predicted _PROTEIN_ were characterized as the functional targeting signals of the respective proteins . _LOCATION_ targeting of full length may have been disturbed by the n terminal _METHOD_ tag or depend on yet unknown auxiliary import _PROTEIN_ missing in the standard _PROTEIN_ system of onion epidermal cells . we next investigated whether representative novel proteins carrying _PROTEIN_ related peptides at the extreme c terminus or _PROTEIN_ peptides outside of the defined n terminal domain are indeed imported into _LOCATION_ and whether these peptides function as targeting signals . the three _PROTEIN_ related tripeptides chosen for these experiments were ssl > ssi > and asl > . the full length fusion protein composed of _METHOD_ and arabidopsis enoyl coa hydratase _PROTEIN_ was targeted to _LOCATION_ . extension of _METHOD_ by the c terminal amino acid residues of _PROTEIN_ directed the reporter protein to punctate structures that coincided with _LOCATION_ thus the c terminal _PROTEIN_ like tripeptide ssl > is the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and a novel functional _PROTEIN_ tripeptide in higher plants . likewise _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ terminating with ssi > was detected in _LOCATION_ . the putative _PROTEIN_ domain of this protein directed _METHOD_ to punctate structures that coincided with _LOCATION_ establishing ssi > as a second novel plant _PROTEIN_ . for epoxide hydrolase isoform carrying the c terminal _PROTEIN_ like tripeptide asl > organelle targeting was difficult to demonstrate owing to a pronounced _LOCATION_ background staining . nevertheless protein targeting to _LOCATION_ could be demonstrated by double labeling in a few cells . attachment of the c terminal amino acid residues of to _METHOD_ directed the reporter protein from the _LOCATION_ to punctate structures that coincided with _LOCATION_ . with these results we conclusively demonstrated targeting of another three proteins to _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and established the _PROTEIN_ like peptides ssl > ssi > and asl > as novel functional _PROTEIN_ peptides for higher plants . by current definition _PROTEIN_ nonapeptides are confined to the n terminal domain comprising amino acid residues . to determine whether the bifunctional tlp identified in arabidopsis leaf _LOCATION_ was targeted to _LOCATION_ by the internally located putative _PROTEIN_ the full length cdna of tlp was cloned downstream of _METHOD_ and transiently _PROTEIN_ in onion epidermal cells . the fusion protein _METHOD_ tlp was detected _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ . however despite the strong background _METHOD_ targeting of _METHOD_ tlp to punctate structures suggestive of _LOCATION_ was observed in some cells . the low contrast between the yellow _METHOD_ punctate structures and the background however allowed conclusive organelle identification as _LOCATION_ by double labeling only in a single cell . in an alternative approach the his residue known to be essential for the targeting function of _PROTEIN_ was mutated to asp . indeed the mutated fusion protein _METHOD_ was no longer targeted to _LOCATION_ but exclusively detected in the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ as was _METHOD_ alone . thus these data demonstrate targeting of a eukaryotic tlp homolog to _LOCATION_ and an internal location of a functional _PROTEIN_ in an endogenous eukaryotic protein . the defense and _LOCATION_ acid metabolism related proteins identified in isolated leaf _LOCATION_ were represented by a relatively high number of proteins lacking known _PROTEIN_ . some of these defense related proteins such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and brassica myrosinases are reported to form polymers . likewise _LOCATION_ acid metabolism related proteins may be components of large protein complexes such as ribosomes exosomes spliceosomes or p bodies . even though unlikely it was conceivable that these proteins were accidentally copurified with leaf _LOCATION_ through large complexes of similar sedimentation behavior in density gradient centrifugation . to distinguish between a physiologically relevant or artificial association of defense and _LOCATION_ acid metabolism related proteins with leaf _LOCATION_ the isolation protocol was modified in such a way that intact leaf _LOCATION_ were lysed in hypoosmotic media by conditions that are not expected to reduce the sedimentation rate of protein complexes . to this end arabidopsis leaves were worked up in grinding and washing buffer lacking sucrose under otherwise identical conditions . indeed the fractions of the sucrose density gradient corresponding to those of intact leaf _LOCATION_ contained substantially less total protein and largely lacked _PROTEIN_ activity indicating that intact leaf _LOCATION_ were efficiently lysed and no longer recovered . when such a fraction volume corresponding to leaf peroxisomal protein in the presence of osmoticum was subjected to de none of the defense related proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were detected by _METHOD_ staining . similarly the _LOCATION_ acid metabolism related proteins _PROTEIN_ and and _PROTEIN_ were not visible . although two very faint spots may coincide with the rna helicases _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ these data as a whole strongly argue against an artificial copurification of high molecular weight complexes formed by the defense or _LOCATION_ acid metabolism related proteins with leaf _LOCATION_ and support a physiologically relevant association of most if not all of these _PROTEIN_ deficient proteins with leaf _LOCATION_ .
standard arabidopsis thaliana ecotype columbia plants were grown for to weeks in a h h dark cycle at under a light intensity of to . for the isolation of leaf _LOCATION_ from senescent leaves week old plants were subjected for d to dark induced senescence . plants were harvested at the end of an extended dark period . arabidopsis leaves were ground in grinding buffer in the presence of protease inhibitors using a mortar and a pestle . the suspension was filtered and chloroplasts were sedimented at _PROTEIN_ . approximately ml of supernatant was loaded onto a percoll density gradient prepared in te buffer supplemented with m sucrose and bsa underlaid by sucrose in te buffer sucrose in te buffer . the percoll gradients were centrifuged for min at rpm and to min at rpm _PROTEIN_ . for analytical purposes the gradient was fractionated in ml fractions and small aliquots frozen for enzymatic analyses . for preparative purposes the _LOCATION_ fractions at the bottom of the gradient of several percoll gradients were combined diluted in sucrose in te buffer and sedimented by centrifugation _PROTEIN_ yielding the leaf peroxisomal fraction lp . the organelles were gently homogenized and loaded on top of a discontinuous sucrose density gradient and ultracentrifuged . for analytical purposes the gradient was fractionated in ml fractions and small aliquots frozen for enzymatic analyses . for preparative purposes the leaf _LOCATION_ fraction lp visible as a sharp white band above sucrose was harvested supplemented with protease inhibitors and stored in appropriate aliquots . for the analysis of an artificial copurification of high molecular weight complexes with leaf _LOCATION_ sucrose was omitted from the grinding and washing buffer and leaves and the fraction corresponding to that of intact leaf _LOCATION_ worked up in an identical manner . the activities of marker enzymes and protein concentration were determined as described or by the d quant kit using bsa as standard . the contamination c of leaf _LOCATION_ by mitochondria and chloroplasts was calculated based on the relative activities of the corresponding marker enzyme activities that were recovered in the leaf _LOCATION_ fraction lp compared with the crude extract according to the following formulae improved protein solubilization was achieved in the presence of urea thiourea and zwitterionic detergents . the limited solubilization capabilities of propanesulfonate were effectively compensated by the addition of amidosulfobetaine though accompanied with a slight _PROTEIN_ in resolution in the first dimension as indicated by vertical smearing of high abundant proteins with basic pi such as gox . the proteins were precipitated dissolved in ief buffer the solution clarified by centrifugation and the proteins subjected for kvh to isoelectric focusing . the proteins were then reduced and alkylated by equilibration for min each in buffer _PROTEIN_ containing either mg/ml dtt or mg/ml iodoacetamide respectively . for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the second dimension the proteins were separated on large gradient gels under denaturing conditions and stained with colloidal _METHOD_ brilliant blue . manually excised gel plugs were processed as described in another recent large scale proteome analysis . briefly an automated platform for the identification of gel separated proteins was used to digest the proteins in gel with trypsin and to prepare the proteolytic peptides for maldi tof _METHOD_ according to the thin layer affinity method . for each sample a pmf spectrum and fragment ion spectra of up to four selected precursor ions were acquired within the same automated analysis loop using an ultraflex i _METHOD_ spectrometer . database searches in the ncbi nonredundant primary sequence database restricted to the taxonomy of arabidopsis were performed using the mascot software _PROTEIN_ licensed in house . _PROTEIN_ of cys residues was specified as fixed and oxidation of methionines as variable modification . one trypsin missed cleavage was allowed . _METHOD_ tolerances were set to ppm for pmf searches and to ppm and d for _METHOD_ ion searches . only proteins represented by at least one peptide sequence match above identity threshold in combination with the presence of at least four peptide _METHOD_ assigned in the pmf were considered as identified . protein analysis was performed according to citation see also detailed protocol in citation . protein pellets were dissolved in to lys c solubilization buffer and digested with endoproteinase lys c with an enzyme substrate ratio of for h at with gentle shaking . the digests were subsequently diluted fourfold with trypsin digestion buffer resulting in a final concentration of m urea . after addition of immobilized trypsin beads _METHOD_ the samples were further incubated for h at with gentle shaking . the digests were dissolved in formic acid . samples were concentrated on a precolumn and subsequently loaded onto a cm silica based rp monolithic column . elution of the peptides was performed using a h gradient from solvent a to solvent b using the agilent nano hplc system with a flow rate of nl per min . eluting peptides were analyzed with an ltq _METHOD_ spectrometer operated in a data dependent mode . each full _METHOD_ scan was followed by three _METHOD_ scans in which the three most abundant peptide molecular ions were dynamically selected for collision induced dissociation using a normalized collision energy of . the temperature of the heated capillary and electrospray voltage was and kv respectively . after _METHOD_ analysis dta files were created from raw files and searched against a database using bioworks software using a precursor ion _METHOD_ tolerance of ppm oxidized met as dynamic modification and fully tryptic peptides with one allowed miscleavage . with dtaselect a list of identified proteins was obtained using the following criteria xcorr and for hits with at least two different peptides . selected peroxisomal proteins found by a single peptide were postanalyzed manually and protein identification confirmed for of proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . all the filtered and manually validated spectra are stored in a _METHOD_ spectral reference library for plant proteomics called promex which is accessible online . using text query searches for instance the arabidopsis genome initiative code of the protein it is possible to list all the corresponding product ion spectra . unknown samples can be searched against the promex library using dta mfg or mz data format files . the full length cdna clones of idh _PROTEIN_ and were cloned by rt pcr using appropriate oligonucleotide primers as described previously for other cdnas . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ hbcdh _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and tlp were ordered from the _PROTEIN_ . the cdna of the minimal acetyltransferase _PROTEIN_ was ordered from the _PROTEIN_ bioresource center and the missing n terminal amino acid residues were added by pcr . the cdnas were subcloned using appropriate oligonucleotide primers into pgemt using the pgem t easy vector system or directly into pcat _METHOD_ n fus to fuse their end in frame with _METHOD_ under control of a double cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . for the predicted transit peptide was omitted when fused terminally with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . site directed mutagenesis was performed using pfuultra high fidelity dna polymerase for mutagenic primer directed replication of both plasmid strands of _METHOD_ tlp in pcat _METHOD_ nfus using the quick change ii site directed mutagenesis kit . thereby the internal _PROTEIN_ was mutated to the loss of function variant . for analysis of the _LOCATION_ targeting function of putative _PROTEIN_ domains the c terminal residues of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ hbcdh idh _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were fused to the c terminus of _METHOD_ by pcr using an extended reverse primer and subcloned likewise into pcat replacing the _METHOD_ insert . in double transformants _LOCATION_ were labeled with _METHOD_ as described previously . onion epidermal cells were transformed biolistically and the onion slices placed on wet paper in petri dishes and stored on a benchtop for to h. for analysis by _METHOD_ microscopy the onion skin epidermal cell layer was peeled and transferred to a glass slide . all subcellular analyses were reproduced at least three times in independent experiments . _METHOD_ microscopy was performed as described . the following materials are available in the online version of this article . supplemental figure . work flow of the isolation of leaf _LOCATION_ from mature leaves of arabidopsis by percoll and sucrose density gradient centrifugation . supplemental figure . detection of specific leaf peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ enzymes in multiple spots and upregulation of defense related proteins in leaf _LOCATION_ from senescent plants . supplemental figure . _PROTEIN_ conservation of novel arabidopsis proteins identified in isolated leaf _LOCATION_ . supplemental figure . subcellular targeting analysis of _METHOD_
