excess reactive oxygen species accumulation under various environmental stresses can damage intracellular polysaccharides dna lipids and proteins . methionine sulfoxide reductase _METHOD_ participates in a protein repair system that is one of the defensive _METHOD_ that diminishes oxidative destruction . in arabidopsis _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ are oxidative stress inducible protein repair enzymes that are abundant in the root . here methyl viologen treatment was demonstrated to increase greatly the accumulation of in _METHOD_ knockdown _METHOD_ knockdown and wild type arabidopsis but not in transgenic plants overexpressing _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ . the reduction in level under mv treatment in these overexpressing plants coincided with increased activity of glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ a herbicide detoxifying enzyme . _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ are suggested to play an important role in defense against oxidative stress . transgenic plants overexpressing _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ were viable and survived after mv and treatment . ectopic _PROTEIN_ of specific _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ genes may be useful for application in crop improvement .
among the nine _METHOD_ genes in arabidopsis _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ are prevalently _PROTEIN_ at higher levels in roots . _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ genes are located close to each other on chromosome and their amino acid sequences share high sequence identity . cauliflower mosaic virus promoter driven green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _METHOD_ fusion genes _METHOD_ _METHOD_ as well as _METHOD_ were transiently _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts . subcellular localization studies indicated that _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ are localized in the cytoplasm . real time reverse transcription pcr results indicated that _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were abundantly _PROTEIN_ in roots moderately _PROTEIN_ in the stalks and _PROTEIN_ at low levels in leaves and flowers . however _METHOD_ was abundantly _PROTEIN_ in leaves moderately _PROTEIN_ in roots and _PROTEIN_ at low levels in flowers . in order to clarify the potential function of these _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ in response to oxidative stress the _PROTEIN_ pattern of the _METHOD_ genes in arabidopsis seedlings was analyzed under time course mv treatment using real time pcr . _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ mrna rapidly accumulated within min and peaked after or h under mv treatment respectively . _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ was also inducible by oxidative stress after mv treatment for h which was _PROTEIN_ than that of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ and peaked after h. nevertheless _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ showed no significant difference within h of mv treatment and was further down regulated after mv treatment for h . these results suggest that _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ but not _METHOD_ are stress inducible and may play important roles in stress defense responses . no _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ knockout lines are available from the arabidopsis biological resource center therefore to investigate the biological function of _METHOD_ genes in stress response we generated overexpression and rna interference silenced knockdown _PROTEIN_ transgenic arabidopsis lines . since _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ share extremely high sequence identity we used their region for rnai and designed _METHOD_ specific primers for the utr to distinguish the _PROTEIN_ of each gene by rt pcr or real time pcr . the _METHOD_ and transgenes were abundantly _PROTEIN_ in the overexpression lines . under normal growth conditions some endogenous _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ transcripts were present in day old wild type seedlings and could be detected by real time pcr . in contrast _PROTEIN_ of endogenous _METHOD_ and was reduced in the knockdown plants . hygromycin resistant homozygous lines including overexpression and knockdown lines then underwent the following treatments . ten day old and wild type seedlings were grown in murashige and skoog _METHOD_ agar medium and the primary root lengths of these plants were measured . the growth phenotype indicated that _METHOD_ knockdown lines had longer primary roots while both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ overexpression lines had shorter primary roots as compared with wild type seedlings . ten day old and wild type seedlings were grown in the presence or absence of mm or mv for d . subsequently the chl content and ion leakage levels were measured . the or mv treated rnai lines and wild type seedlings showed a severe bleaching phenotype with drastically reduced chl content but the _METHOD_ plants showed only a minor alteration in phenotype . furthermore the chl content declined much more sharply in the and lines than in wild type plants . we also examined _LOCATION_ integrity by monitoring electrolyte leakage in or mv treated _METHOD_ plants . or mv treatment caused severe ion leakage in wild type plants and in rnai lines in contrast only mild to moderate ion leakage was detected in _METHOD_ plants . these results indicate that _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ overexpression in arabidopsis protects cells from both mv and induced oxidative stresses . two lines each of and homozygous seeds were directly sown in soil . mv was applied to week old seedlings by spraying directly onto the leaves . two days after mv spraying the wild type plants showed severe wilting while the transgenic plants remained relatively healthy . fresh weight and ion leakage were measured in both the wild type plants and the transgenic lines . in agreement with the observed phenotype the and transgenic plants showed significantly less reduction in fresh weight and ion leakage after mv treatment than the wild type plants . these results indicate that _METHOD_ plants also conferred tolerance to mv under soil based culture conditions . in situ measurements by diaminobenzidine staining showed that there was less accumulation in and transgenic plants than in knockdown and wild type plants . to elucidate the possible molecular mechanism underlying the protection from oxidative stress conferred by _PROTEIN_ of various _METHOD_ genes we tested the activity of various ros scavenging enzymes such as catalase glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ and peroxidase . the activity of each enzyme was measured in wild type plants and in individual _METHOD_ transgenic lines that had undergone treatment with mv for d . cat px and _PROTEIN_ activities were induced in all the mv treated plants . in both the presence and absence of mv the endogenous levels of cat and px were lower in _METHOD_ than in wild type plants but higher in rnai lines . _PROTEIN_ activity displayed no significant difference in any of the treated plants under control conditions whereas it was elevated in _METHOD_ plants in comparison with rnai and wild type plants upon mv treatment . taken together cat and px activities were higher in the _METHOD_ rnai lines under oxidative stress whereas _PROTEIN_ activity remained higher in _METHOD_ overexpression lines than in wild type arabidopsis . to verify whether all of the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ genes constitutively _PROTEIN_ in plants can confer tolerance to oxidative stress we generated transgenic plants overexpressing _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ with _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ as a control . seeds of the wild type and the _METHOD_ and double overexpression transgenic plants were germinated on medium supplemented with various concentrations of mv for d . initially the wild type and transgenic plant seeds germinated well . however after d wild type seedlings ceased to grow on media containing and nm mv . the growth of seedlings was inhibited by mv at nm . the development of true leaves on seedlings was not affected by mv at < nm . transgenic seedlings displayed the most robust growth at all concentrations . the plants grew well on medium containing nm mv but the growth of true leaves was slightly inhibited in comparison with the phenotype . tested at higher mv concentrations showed reasonably good growth . since exhibited robust growth with greener leaves at nm we decided to use nm for further experiments . to confirm the germination and growth of other _METHOD_ transgenic plants including _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ genes with _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ as a control their seeds along with those of wild type plants were sown on media with or without mv . _PROTEIN_ and showed a germination pattern similar to that of . the growth of was similar to or better than that of the wild type at nm mv however did not grow as well as and at nm mv . in conclusion transgenic plants overexpressing cytsolic _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ showed more tolerance to mv compared with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ overexpression lines and wild type plants . transgene integration in the putative transgenic tomato plants was initially confirmed by pcr . southern hybridization was used to confirm transgene integration in the putative transgenic plants . genomic dna from three randomly picked _METHOD_ transgenic tomato plants was digested with hindiii and probed with digoxigenin labeled hpt . multiple transgene insertions of hpt were observed . the transgenic tomato plants were further tested for transgene _PROTEIN_ by rt pcr using _METHOD_ genes hpt and tomato primers or by real time pcr using _METHOD_ forward primer _METHOD_ and nos terminator reverse primer and primers . the _METHOD_ transgene and hpt were highly _PROTEIN_ in individually tested transgenic plants . a non transformed wild type sample that showed no transgene amplification signal was used as the control . the housekeeping gene or served to normalize sample to sample variation in amounts of rna . the emerged fully expanded leaves of month old and wild type tomato plants were detached and treated with mv for d . subsequently accumulation and chl content were measured . dab staining in situ showed less accumulation in three independent lines of transgenic tomato plants than in wild type plants . in addition the chl content remained higher in mv treated lines than in mv treated wild type leaflets . these results indicate that overexpression of _METHOD_ can protect tomato plants from mv induced oxidative stress by reducing accumulation . to verify whether _METHOD_ overexpression had a negative influence on growth development and yield we also generated _METHOD_ overexpressing transgenic tomato and calculated the fruit number per plant seed number per fruit and fresh weight of the progeny of transgenic and wild type tomato plants . transgenic plants exhibited normal phenotype and no yield drag compared with wild type plants .
