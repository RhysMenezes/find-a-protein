in diffusely growing plant cells cortical microtubules play an important role in regulating the direction of cell expansion . arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ mutant is defective in directional cell elongation and exhibits right handed helical growth in longitudinally expanding organs such as root hypocotyl stem petiole and _PROTEIN_ . the growth of _PROTEIN_ roots is more sensitive to microtubule interacting drugs than is wild type root growth . the _PROTEIN_ gene encodes a plant specific kd protein containing heat repeat motifs that are implicated in protein protein interaction . when _PROTEIN_ constitutively _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein fusion protein complemented the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype and was localized to cortical microtubules as well as other mitotic microtubule arrays in transgenic plants . recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein directly bound to taxol stabilized microtubules in vitro . furthermore _PROTEIN_ specific antibody and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ identified a tobacco _PROTEIN_ homolog in highly purified microtubule associated protein fractions from tobacco by cell cultures . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is a novel microtubule associated protein and is required for proper microtubule function involved in anisotropic growth .
we have previously isolated _PROTEIN_ in the landsberg _LOCATION_ background and reported that _PROTEIN_ is allelic to a classic twisting mutant convoluta . further genetic screening identified two additional alleles _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenized seedlings of the columbia ecotype . because all _PROTEIN_ alleles showed very similar phenotypes only _PROTEIN_ is shown in figure . the twisting phenotype of _PROTEIN_ was most apparent in _PROTEIN_ organs such as cotyledon rosette leaf and _PROTEIN_ . when the plant is viewed from above these organs are twisted in a counterclockwise direction . the counterclockwise twisting of rosette leaf and cotyledon was caused by right handed helical growth of epidermal cell files in petioles . epidermal cell files of hypocotyl and stem in dark grown plants also formed constitutive right handed helices . to test whether _PROTEIN_ is compromised in _METHOD_ of microtubule function we examined the effects of microtubule interacting drugs on the growth of primary roots . when grown on a vertically placed hard agar plate wild type roots grew slightly toward the left side of the plate whereas _PROTEIN_ roots grew slightly toward the right indicating that the _PROTEIN_ mutation affected the root as well . when seedlings were grown on a medium containing a low dose of the microtubule depolymerizing drug oryzalin or the microtubule stabilizing drug taxol growth of wild type primary roots was inhibited slightly by oryzalin and by by taxol . at these drug concentrations _PROTEIN_ roots were affected somewhat more strongly than wild type roots . to substantiate the drug response we studied the effect of the _PROTEIN_ mutation in the tubulin mutant background . the _PROTEIN_ double mutant showed left handed helical growth in all twisting organs where twisting angles were slightly increased compared to suggesting that is epistatic to _PROTEIN_ and that its helical growth phenotype is slightly enhanced by the _PROTEIN_ mutation . when _PROTEIN_ seedlings were treated with oryzalin taxol or nm rh another potent microtubule depolymerizing drug the root growth was severely inhibited by more than by oryzalin and taxol and by by rh . at the same drug concentrations growth of primary roots was inhibited by less than by oryzalin and taxol and only by by rh . these results indicate that the _PROTEIN_ mutation markedly enhanced sensitivities to microtubule interacting drugs in the mutant background . by crossing _PROTEIN_ with wild type col the _PROTEIN_ locus had been mapped between molecular markers _PROTEIN_ and on chromosome . for further genetic mapping cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence markers were developed based on sequence information on the bacterial artificial chromosome clones covering this region . by analyzing chromosomes the _PROTEIN_ locus was delimited to a kb region containing putative open reading frames . we sequenced some of these orfs and found a bp deletion in _GENE_ from the _PROTEIN_ genomic dna . when _PROTEIN_ was used to examine the end of the transcript we found that the predicted orf of _GENE_ in the database lacks amino acids at the n terminus . the corrected dna sequence was deposited in genbank . the bp deletion in the third exon of _GENE_ in _PROTEIN_ would cause a frameshift in the encoded protein after amino acid . further sequence analysis revealed that the other three _PROTEIN_ alleles all carried mutations in this gene . in _PROTEIN_ the exon intron boundary of the third exon was changed from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to aa _PROTEIN_ . this change destroys the splicing consensus at the acceptor site . in _PROTEIN_ the c at was changed to a t resulting in the substitution of glu with a stop codon . we also found a bp deletion in the first exon of _GENE_ in the convoluta allele which would cause a frameshift after amino acid . a line with a t dna insertion in the third exon of _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ was identified in the salk t dna collection and showed a right handed helical growth phenotype characteristic of _PROTEIN_ mutants when the t dna was present in the homozygous state . these five _PROTEIN_ alleles showed very similar phenotypes indicating that these are all null alleles . a full length cdna of _GENE_ was assembled fused to kb flanking and kb flanking genomic regions and introduced into _PROTEIN_ by an agrobacterium mediated transformation method . thirteen kanamycin resistant transgenic lines were generated and clear complementation of the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype was confirmed in of them . we therefore conclude that _GENE_ is the _PROTEIN_ gene . _PROTEIN_ is predicted to encode a protein of amino acids with an estimated molecular _METHOD_ of kd and a pi of . a blast search of databases identified similar proteins of unknown function in arabidopsis potato and rice and multiple _PROTEIN_ sequence tag sequences in various plants but no homologous proteins in nonplant _METHOD_ . the arabidopsis protein encoded by _GENE_ and potato _PROTEIN_ share the highest similarity to _PROTEIN_ over the entire length _PROTEIN_ . potato _PROTEIN_ had been isolated as a host protein interacting with a potyviral multifunctional protein helper component proteinase by a yeast two hybrid screening . sequence analysis using a repeat finding method identified repeat motifs in _PROTEIN_ and its homologs . nine repeats are predicted in _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ and _PROTEIN_ in the regions highly conserved among them and seven of them are clustered in the n terminal region . the repeat unit consists of to amino acid residues and is composed of two predicted helical structures separated by a hinge region . alignment of the _PROTEIN_ repeat motifs showed that the _PROTEIN_ repeat is characteristic of the heat repeat . canonical heat repeat motifs have seven conserved hydrophobic residues in two helices in which four are often leu and one is frequently val . although structurally related armadillo motifs also share these residues the signature residues for heat motifs are asp right after the first helix and arg/lys in the n terminus of the second helix which are both conserved in the _PROTEIN_ repeat motifs . the heat repeat sequences and their predicted numbers in the four less related _PROTEIN_ homologs are divergent from those in _PROTEIN_ and _GENE_ . the extreme n terminal region of _PROTEIN_ is rich in ser and thr . a ser/thr rich n terminus was also found in _GENE_ and _PROTEIN_ but not in other homologs . a motif search with the psort program predicted that this n terminal region is a targeting signal to _LOCATION_ but cellular localization studies demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ is not targeted to _LOCATION_ . we did not detect significant levels of the _PROTEIN_ transcript in wild type plants by rna gel blot analysis . the low abundance of _PROTEIN_ sequences in the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ sequence tags and _METHOD_ parallel signature sequencing databases supports that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ level is low in wild type arabidopsis plants . therefore we carried out a reverse transcription pcr analysis using primers specific to _PROTEIN_ but not to its homologs in arabidopsis . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was detected in flower bud cauline leaf rosette leaf inflorescence stem root and cotyledon at similar levels indicating that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is not restricted to any particular organ . next we raised an anti _PROTEIN_ polyclonal antibody against an n terminal region of recombinant _PROTEIN_ and used it to detect _PROTEIN_ protein in arabidopsis seedlings . the antibody recognized a band of about to kd in wild type seedlings but not in _PROTEIN_ seedlings indicating its specificity . in wild type seedlings more _PROTEIN_ protein was recovered in the microsomal fraction than in the soluble fraction . since the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ appears to be low in wild type plants we examined the consequences of overexpression for cell morphology and growth . _PROTEIN_ was fused to a tandem tag of hemaglutinin and hexa his at its c terminus and _PROTEIN_ under the transcriptional control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter in arabidopsis plants . when the fusion protein was _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ the helical mutant phenotype was effectively complemented with the transgene _PROTEIN_ indicating that this _PROTEIN_ fusion protein is functional in plants . we transformed wild type wassilewskija plants with the construct and obtained kanamycin resistant transgenic lines . ten lines showed right handed helical growth characteristic of the _PROTEIN_ mutant while the remaining eight lines did not differ from wild type plants in growth or cell morphology and did not show any twisting phenotypes . two lines each from the twisting and wild type growth groups were analyzed further . in both twisting lines _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ were severely reduced probably by cosuppression . in contrast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was considerably increased in the two lines that showed wild type growth . the _PROTEIN_ protein level was also highly increased in these lines . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ overexpression does not induce helical growth or other morphological abnormalities . to examine the intracellular localization _PROTEIN_ was fused to _METHOD_ at its c terminus and was _PROTEIN_ under the transcriptional control of the camv promoter . when _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion gene rescued the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype suggesting the functional integrity of this fusion protein . confocal microscopic analysis revealed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ aligned along filamentous structures in the cortical region of leaf epidermal cells . when the epidermal cells were optically sectioned at deeper focal planes no obvious _METHOD_ structures were observed in the cytoplasmic regions but strong _METHOD_ dots were seen underneath the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . at high magnification the cortical filamentous labeling was found in either continuous or linear punctuate patterns . in a single cell both patterns are often present in varying preference to either pattern . similar filamentous labeling was also observed in leaf trichome epidermal cells of etiolated hypocotyl and epidermal cells of the differentiated region in root . the cortical filamentous labeling suggests an association of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with cortical microtubules . to confirm this we treated the leaf tissues with the microtubule destabilizing drug propyzamide . this treatment caused the disappearance of filamentous _METHOD_ patterns leaving _METHOD_ foci at the cell cortex . similar results were obtained with oryzalin . in addition to cortical microtubules _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was also localized to mitotic spindles and phragmoplast microtubules in dividing cells of the transgenic arabidopsis roots . cortical microtubules preprophase bands mitotic spindles and phragmoplasts were also stained with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in stably transformed tobacco by cells . to test whether _PROTEIN_ directly binds to microtubules we carried out an in vitro microtubule cosedimentation assay . full length _PROTEIN_ was fused at the n terminus with thioredoxin and poly his tags _PROTEIN_ and was _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli . chromatography and the cleavage of n terminal tags with a protease resulted in a homogeneous preparation of recombinant _PROTEIN_ in a native form . taxol stabilized microtubules were prepared from map free tubulins of tobacco by cells . when the purified _PROTEIN_ was centrifuged in the absence of microtubules the protein remained in the supernatant . however a significant proportion of _PROTEIN_ was recovered in the pellet when it was incubated with an excess of microtubules . to determine the stoichiometry and affinity of _PROTEIN_ toward microtubules various amounts of _PROTEIN_ were centrifuged with a constant quantity of microtubules and a binding curve was obtained . recombinant _PROTEIN_ bound to microtubules in a concentration dependent and saturable manner . the binding to microtubules was saturated at a stoichiometry of mol of _PROTEIN_ per mole of tubulin dimer if we assume that _PROTEIN_ binds uniformly to microtubule side walls . the dissociation constant kd of _PROTEIN_ was determined to be . to examine whether endogenous _PROTEIN_ like protein is associated with microtubules in plants other than arabidopsis as well we searched for the presence of a tobacco _PROTEIN_ homolog in purified map fractions . _LOCATION_ free miniprotoplasts were prepared from cultured tobacco by cells and microtubules were purified from the protein rich protoplast extracts through two rounds of microtubule polymerization and depolymerization using taxol . the purified fraction was highly enriched with and tubulins as well as several copurified proteins . _METHOD_ spectrometric analysis identified three major copurified bands as known tobacco maps map and a mixture of map and map . immunoblot analysis showed that a protein of about kd cross reacted with anti _PROTEIN_ antibody in the microtubule protein fraction but was undetectable in the crude cell extract indicating that a tobacco protein immunologically related to _PROTEIN_ was copurified with microtubules . to unambiguously identify this _PROTEIN_ related protein tobacco proteins in the purified map fraction were further fractionated by anion exchange chromatography and eluted fractions were analyzed by general protein staining and immunoblotting . tobacco _PROTEIN_ related protein was eluted right after the map and map fractions and before the tubulin fractions . the amount of this protein appeared to be less than that of map or map . the _PROTEIN_ related protein bands in fractions to were excised from the polyacrylamide gel and then subjected to liquid chromatography tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis . when the _METHOD_ spectrum data were used to screen the national center for biotechnology information nonredundant protein database the best fit was found in the amino acid sequence of potato _PROTEIN_ a closely related homolog of _PROTEIN_ . six peptide sequences matched perfectly with the expected peptide sequences from tryptic digests of _PROTEIN_ . taken together we conclude that a tobacco _PROTEIN_ homolog was copurified with microtubules from tobacco by cells .
