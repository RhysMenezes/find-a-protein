in the brassicaceae compatible pollen pistil interactions result in pollen adhesion to the stigma while pollen grains from unrelated plant species are largely ignored . there can also be an additional layer of recognition to prevent self fertilization the self incompatibility response whereby self pollen grains are distinguished from nonself pollen grains and rejected . this pathway is activated in the stigma and involves the arm repeat containing _PROTEIN_ protein an ubiquitin ligase . in a screen for _PROTEIN_ interacting proteins we have identified brassica napus _PROTEIN_ a putative component of the exocyst complex that is known to regulate _PROTEIN_ secretion . we show through transgenic studies that loss of _PROTEIN_ in brassica and arabidopsis thaliana stigmas leads to the rejection of compatible pollen at the same stage as the self incompatibility response . a red _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ fusion rescues this stigmatic defect in arabidopsis and is found to be mobilized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ concomitant with flowers opening . by contrast increased _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in self incompatible brassica partially overcomes the self pollen rejection response . thus our data show that the _PROTEIN_ protein functions at the intersection of two cellular pathways where it is required in the stigma for the acceptance of compatible pollen in both brassica and arabidopsis and is negatively regulated by brassica self incompatibility .
to identify potential substrates regulated by the _PROTEIN_ ligase during the brassica self incompatibility pathway a pistil cdna yeast two hybrid library was screened and resulted in the isolation of an homolog . in plant genomes there are multiple predicted copies of the gene and the clone isolated in our study was most similar to the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ . the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ was confirmed using in vitro binding assays with recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins . the _PROTEIN_ fusion protein bound to the ni beads was able to bind _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and no signal was detected when _PROTEIN_ was added . similarly when _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ alone were bound to the gsh beads the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was pulled down only when _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was present . since _PROTEIN_ has been previously shown to possess ligase activity we wanted to examine if _PROTEIN_ can function as a substrate for _PROTEIN_ . when the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ recombinant protein was added to the ubiquitination assay containing _PROTEIN_ along with the and enzymes higher molecular weight laddering indicative of polyubiquitination was observed . in comparison the control lanes lacking either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ did not show this higher molecular weight laddering . thus both the in vitro binding and ubiquitination assays suggest that _PROTEIN_ can be a binding partner and a substrate for _PROTEIN_ . the isolation of _PROTEIN_ as an _PROTEIN_ interactor implies a previously unknown role for in the stigma during pollen stigma interactions . _PROTEIN_ functions in the stigma as part of the self incompatibility response and has a positive role promoting the rejection of self pollen . it is predicted to carry out this function by targeting substrate proteins for degradation by the proteasome . following from this an _PROTEIN_ target would be predicted to be required in the stigmatic papillae to accept compatible pollen and pollen rejection would occur when the target is inactivated . this prediction can be simply tested by removing the target _PROTEIN_ from the stigma and testing if compatible pollen can still be accepted . brassica _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in several tissues with highest levels of _PROTEIN_ in the pistil and with lowest levels in stamens . thus to suppress b. napus _PROTEIN_ exclusively in the stigma the _PROTEIN_ rna interference construct was placed under the control of the stigma specific _PROTEIN_ promoter and this construct was transformed into b. napus westar a fully compatible cultivar that produces full seedpods following self pollination . three independent transgenic westar lines _PROTEIN_ to were generated and found to have reduced levels of _PROTEIN_ in the stigma . as expected the _PROTEIN_ rnai westar lines produce flowers of wild type appearance and viable pollen with full seedpods observed when wild type westar pistils are pollinated with this pollen . however also as predicted the _PROTEIN_ rnai westar stigmas are impaired in compatible pollen acceptance and a corresponding reduction in seed production is observed for all three lines . the _PROTEIN_ rnai westar lines pollinated with compatible westar pollen produced significantly lower means of and seeds/pod compared with seeds/pod produced by the control compatible b. napus westar pollinations . the self incompatible b. napus line was used as a control for self pollen rejection with the ensuing absence of seed production . these results show that brassica _PROTEIN_ plays an essential role in the stigma during compatible pollen stigma interactions . based on _PROTEIN_ 's essential role in the stigma for compatible pollinations and its ability to interact with and function as a substrate for _PROTEIN_ we hypothesized that one way through which _PROTEIN_ imparts its ubiquitin ligase activity during self incompatibility is by targeting _PROTEIN_ for degradation . if this were true then elevation of _PROTEIN_ levels in a self incompatible line may overcome the pollen rejection response by essentially titrating out _PROTEIN_ 's activity . this prediction was tested by _PROTEIN_ a red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ construct under the control of the stigma specific _PROTEIN_ promoter in the self incompatible b. napus line . the b. napus line is identified by the presence of the self incompatibility allele through pcr detection of the _PROTEIN_ gene and two independent transgenic _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ lines and were generated . consistent with this hypothesis the and plants had increased seed production following pollination with self incompatible pollen than did the control self pollinated plants . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ lines produced averages of and seeds/pods when pollinated with pollen which was significantly higher than the self incompatible control which did not produce any seeds . all the control compatible pollinations with westar as the pollen donor for and pistils produced full seedpods as expected . thus the increased levels of _PROTEIN_ were able to titrate out _PROTEIN_ 's activity and partially overcome the self incompatibility phenotype of plants . we attempted to visualize the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein in the b. napus and lines using confocal microscopy but were unable to detect _METHOD_ through the dense brassica stigmatic papillae . the presence of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein in the stigma was confirmed by immunoblot analysis using an anti _METHOD_ antibody prior to and after pollination following either and westar pollinations . while activation of the self incompatibility pathway leading to _PROTEIN_ mediated degradation of _PROTEIN_ would be predicted to reduce _PROTEIN_ protein levels following pollinations no clear _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ protein levels was observed after pollination . however this would be difficult to detect given the increased levels of _PROTEIN_ in the and lines in addition this predicted effect would only occur in a small subset of the stigmatic cells the stigmatic papillae in contact with pollen . with the establishment of the biological function of _PROTEIN_ brassica stigmas following pollination we then investigated the cellular function of _PROTEIN_ in these responses . pollen stigma interactions in the _PROTEIN_ rnai westar lines and the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ lines were observed more closely to examine pollen hydration and pollen tube penetration through the stigmatic surface . during control compatible b. napus westar pollinations the pollen grains rapidly hydrated within min and continued to increase in diameter up to min following pollination . by contrast in the control self incompatible b. napus pollinations the pollen grains displayed very poor hydration due to the activated self incompatibility pathway in the stigmatic papillae . interestingly westar pollen on the _PROTEIN_ rnai westar stigmas _PROTEIN_ exhibited significantly reduced hydration . by contrast pollen on the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ stigmas show significant increases in hydration . thus _PROTEIN_ the levels of _PROTEIN_ in westar stigmas resulted in reduced pollen hydration in comparison to the westar compatible control while increasing _PROTEIN_ in stigmas resulted in increased pollen hydration in comparison to the self incompatible control . these results were also confirmed when aniline blue stained pollinated pistils were observed for pollen germination and pollen tube growth . at h after pollination control compatible b. napus westar pistils had a large number of pollen grains adhered to the stigma and these pollen grains had germinated and produced pollen tubes that penetrated the stigmatic surface . by contrast control self incompatible b. napus pistils did not have any pollen grains present since the rejected pollen had failed to adhere and were washed away during the aniline blue staining . significantly and in contrast with the control pollinations the _PROTEIN_ rnai westar stigmas had very few westar pollen grains present and the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ stigmas had a number of pollen grains adhering to the stigmatic surface . some of the pollen adhering to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ stigmas had germinated to produce pollen tubes . thus changes in _PROTEIN_ levels have a dramatic effect on pollen hydration and germination affecting one of the earliest stages known to be blocked by the brassica self incompatibility response . in addition to blocking pollen hydration the brassica self incompatibility response can also block any pollen tubes emerging from hydrated pollen grains from penetrating the stigmatic surface . to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ has a role in this latter stage pollen stigma interactions in the _PROTEIN_ rnai westar lines and the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ lines were again examined at h after pollination . while the and westar controls remain unchanged compared with h after pollination westar pollen on the _PROTEIN_ rnai westar stigmas were eventually able to germinate and produce pollen tubes . however the pollen tubes appeared quite stunted and were blocked from penetrating the stigmatic surface . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ lines also had a number of self incompatible pollen that gave rise to stunted pollen tubes . thus _PROTEIN_ is also required for successful pollen tube penetration through the stigmatic cell wall and reducing _PROTEIN_ levels in the stigma prevents the penetration of compatible westar pollen tubes . furthermore the overexpression of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was not able to completely break down this stage of the self incompatibility response although some pollen tubes successfully penetrated the stigmatic surface to produce seeds as shown in figures and . having established a critical role of b. napus _PROTEIN_ in brassica pollen stigma interactions its role was also examined in arabidopsis a self fertile species in the brassicaeae . the putative ortholog for b. napus _PROTEIN_ is arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ . transgenic arabidopsis lines carrying an arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ construct displayed gus _PROTEIN_ in several tissues and interestingly have strong gus activity in the stigma of mature flowers . this is a typical _PROTEIN_ profile for genes that are active in the stigma during pollen stigma interactions . null mutants for arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ were previously shown to be slow growing semidwarf plants with an extended life span and defects in organ morphogenesis and fertility . to examine the pollen stigma interactions in the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ mutants more closely two independent t dna insertion lines as previously reported by citation were isolated . while citation reported that the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ mutant stigmas were immature in appearance at flower bud opening we found that this was variable and that elongated stigmatic papillae could be observed . when individual wild type arabidopsis pollen grains were placed on wild type stigmatic papillae of the pollen grains were fully hydrated as shown in figure . conversely elongated stigmatic papillae from the _PROTEIN_ mutant lines failed to support wild type pollen hydration . only of the wild type pollen placed on the _PROTEIN_ stigmatic papillae showed any hydration with these pollen grains being only partially hydrated . to confirm that the loss of pollen hydration was correlated with the loss of _PROTEIN_ heterozygous _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis plants were transformed with the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ construct and two independent lines of homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the stigma were recovered . detailed pollination studies were then performed on stigmas from columbia the _PROTEIN_ mutant and the and plants transformed with the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct with aniline blue staining which is used to detect pollen tubes . as expected for the self fertile col control the stigmas were covered with adhered pollen grains and numerous pollen tubes could be detected . by contrast when wild type col pollen were used to pollinate the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ mutant stigmas the pollen were largely rejected with very few pollen grains detected following aniline blue staining . while the _PROTEIN_ mutant showed variability in papillar elongation there was no adherance of compatible pollen _PROTEIN_ of whether papillae were short or elongated . the _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein in the _PROTEIN_ mutant stigmas fully restored the ability of compatible wild type col pollen to adhere to the _PROTEIN_ stigmas and produce pollen tubes . both the control col and the rescued pollinated pistils produced large numbers of seeds per silique while no seeds were detected in the _PROTEIN_ siliques pollinated with col pollen . thus the brassica and arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ share conserved functions in the stigma namely promoting pollen hydration and pollen tube growth of compatible pollen and loss of _PROTEIN_ produces a phenotype that is correlated with the brassica self incompatibility response . having established that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ can rescue the stigmatic defect in the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ mutants we then examined where the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is localized in the stigma during pollinations . as the arabidopsis stigmatic papillae are smaller and less dense than those of brassica the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ from the elongated papillae could readily be visualized in these lines using confocal microscopy . segregating progeny from heterozygous _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis plants transformed with the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct were genotyped to identify both the wild type and homozygous mutant . confocal imaging of unpollinated stigmas revealed _METHOD_ _METHOD_ localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of stigmatic papillae from freshly opened flowers . interestingly the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is only achieved at maturity as an examination of stigmas from unopened flower buds revealed _METHOD_ _METHOD_ localized to internal punctate structures a staining pattern reminiscent of _LOCATION_ . in other _METHOD_ functions as a spatial landmark at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ for the assembly of the exocyst complex which in turn tethers secretory vesicles for exocytosis . thus the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in mature stigmatic papillae is consistent with functioning as a spatial landmark . the localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was also examined in and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was found to localize to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ though to a lesser extent than for with some internal punctate structures remaining . since the _PROTEIN_ promoter was used to drive the _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ homozygous mutants only the stigmatic fertility defect is fully restored in these plants . the overall growth defect remains in these plants and may be related to some of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ remaining within the cells . the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was verified by crossing the line to a green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ marker line since the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ can often be in close proximity to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in stigmatic papillae . the green _METHOD_ from the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ marker outlines the _LOCATION_ of the central _LOCATION_ as well as the apical _LOCATION_ network . figure shows a tip of a stigmatic papilla where the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ are distinct from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . furthermore the line was crossed to a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ marker line to examine the _LOCATION_ like _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ punctate structures in immature stigmatic papillae and colocalization was observed indicating that these structures are _LOCATION_ . finally the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localization pattern was examined following compatible pollinations in the wild type stigmatic papillae . after several minutes we consistently observed that the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ disappeared from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in stigmatic papillae that were in contact with col pollen . examples of this are shown in figures and where at and min after pollination the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ can not be detected in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of stigmatic papillae that are in contact with the pollen grains while the neighboring unpollinated stigmatic papillae appear to be unchanged . thus there are substantial changes in the subcellular distribution of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ following a compatible pollination . given the critical role of _PROTEIN_ in the stigmatic papillae in the early stages following compatible pollinations _PROTEIN_ would be an effective target for the self incompatibility pathway to promote pollen rejection . given _PROTEIN_ 's activity as an ligase its ability to bind and ubiquitinate _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ that _PROTEIN_ localizes to the proteasome in by suspension cells in the presence of active _PROTEIN_ we tested whether _PROTEIN_ could target brassica _PROTEIN_ to the proteasome . constructs generated with different epitope tags at the n terminus of each protein were transiently _PROTEIN_ in by cells and followed by _METHOD_ microscopy to determine subcellular localization patterns . both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ as well as the _METHOD_ control were predominantly distributed throughout the _LOCATION_ when _PROTEIN_ either alone or together . when a constitutively active _PROTEIN_ kinase domain was added as a _PROTEIN_ kinase fusion there was no effect on the _METHOD_ control but a redistribution of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to punctate structures generally around the perinuclear region was observed . a similar pattern was also seen when arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ was coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the proteasomal subunit _PROTEIN_ was found to colocalize to these punctate structures with _PROTEIN_ and this pattern overlapped with the concanavalin a marker for the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . two endosomal markers were also tested _PROTEIN_ a marker for the _PROTEIN_ endosome/prevacuolar compartment and _PROTEIN_ which resides in the trans _LOCATION_ network . while _PROTEIN_ did not colocalize with the _PROTEIN_ subcellular structures there was some overlap with the _PROTEIN_ marker . thus these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ triggers the relocalization of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ associated proteasomes and that there may be some association between the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins with the _PROTEIN_ endosome/prevacuolar compartment .
to identify potential substrates regulated by _PROTEIN_ different domains of _PROTEIN_ were used to screen a pistil cdna yeast two hybrid library as previously described and a single positive interaction was isolated with the _PROTEIN_ n terminal domain . using blast searches at the national center for biotechnology information and the arabidopsis information resource the brassica napus cdna was predicted to encode a protein with sequence similarity to and was named _PROTEIN_ due to its highest sequence similarity to arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ . the amino acid sequence alignment of b. napus _PROTEIN_ to arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ was generated from the blast searches and edited manually . for in vitro binding studies _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins were _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli plyss cells and purified using ni _PROTEIN_ agarose beads or gsh agarose beads respectively as previously described . binding assays were set up using of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and of either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as previously described . protein gel blot analyses were performed using rabbit anti _PROTEIN_ mouse anti his mouse anti _PROTEIN_ or rabbit anti _PROTEIN_ primary antibodies and anti rabbit or anti mouse secondary antibodies _PROTEIN_ followed by detection with the enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit . ubiquitination of purified _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was performed as previously described using the arabidopsis enzyme _PROTEIN_ and the yeast enzyme . the ubiquitination assays were fractionated on a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gel followed by protein gel blot analysis using anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies . b. napus transgenic lines were created as previously described . for the _PROTEIN_ rnai westar lines pcr was used to tailor a double stranded rnai construct using the n terminal nucleotides of the b. napus _PROTEIN_ open reading frame behind the strong stigma specific _PROTEIN_ promoter . the binary vector containing the _PROTEIN_ promoter was digested with smai and bamhi to ligate the rnai construct . kanamycin positive primary transformants were analyzed for reduced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by rna gel blot analysis as previously described . these lines were also analyzed for pollen adhesion pollen tube growth and seed set as described previously . the and _PROTEIN_ rnai westar lines were analyzed in the generation as well and they displayed the same pollen rejection traits observed in the plants . pollinations for aniline blue staining were performed as previously described . the aniline blue _METHOD_ was captured as gray scale images colored green and overlaid with the red _METHOD_ obtained from pollen . for the hydration experiments pedicels of newly opened flowers were immersed in water and pollen grains were added on the top of the stigma . pollen hydration was tracked using a stereomicroscope and images were captured from a _PROTEIN_ view for min using a leica camera with the _PROTEIN_ program . these images were processed through imagej to measure the principal diameter of the pollen grains during the hydration process . for the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ lines the b. napus _PROTEIN_ open reading frame fused to _METHOD_ was subcloned behind a binary vector containing the _PROTEIN_ promoter and transformed into plants using agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation . transgenic lines were screened and analyzed as described above . _PROTEIN_ was analyzed by rt pcr using primers to specifically detect the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ mrna and actin was used as a positive control . for rt pcr total rna was isolated from the stigmas from various transgenic and control plants and used to synthesize cdna through oligo mediated reverse transcription . from this of cdna was used for pcr using gene specific primers . rt pcr products were visualized using ethidium bromide . confocal microscopy was also used to examine the localization pattern of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ but the _PROTEIN_ levels were not high enough to visualize the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the dense brassica stigmatic papillae . the same construct gave successful confocal results in the more transparent arabidopsis stigmatic papillae . for protein gel blotting using anti _METHOD_ antibodies stigmatic proteins were extracted from either unpollinated or pollinated pistils from the transgenic _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ line and pollinations were performed with either self incompatible pollen or compatible westar pollen . protein extracts were fractionated on a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gel and probed with anti _METHOD_ antibodies . two salk t dna insertion lines for _PROTEIN_ were analyzed as shown in supplemental figures to online . these lines were previously reported by citation as having defects in the elongation of stigmatic papillae in flowers from week old plants . we observed that the stigmas showed variability in stigmatic papillar elongation at flower bud opening and found that the _PROTEIN_ mutants would produce more fully elongated stigmatic papillae when the plants were misted daily . for the pollen hydration studies stage flowers from col plants were emasculated and covered with plastic wrap overnight to allow flower development to stage . for the _PROTEIN_ plants the largest buds were emasculated and left overnight and stigmas with elongated papillae were used for the hydration studies . since the _PROTEIN_ plants are sterile pistils from open flowers were also tested yielding the same results . pistils were excised and mounted on a microscope slide using double sided tape . an individual col pollen grain was placed on a stigmatic papilla using a sisikiyou designs micromanipulator . the pollen grain was then monitored using an inverted olympus microscope with a objective and images were acquired with a ccd camera using imagemaster . pollinations were conducted under low humidity conditions . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ construct was used to transform heterozygous _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis plants using the floral dip method . the segregating seeds were selected on kanamycin and genotyped to isolate wild type and mutant plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . two of the strongest lines and were used to analyze the rescue of pollen adherence pollen tube growth and seed set following pollination with wild type col pollen . controlled pollinations were performed using pistils from col _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants to assess pollen adhesion pollen tube growth and seed set using col pollen . stage flowers were emasculated and covered with plastic wrap for h hand pollinated with col pollen and rewrapped again in plastic wrap for h. for pollen adhesion and pollen tube growth studies the pistils were then stained with aniline blue and observed with an _METHOD_ microscope . for seed production the coverings were removed and the siliques were allowed to mature . mature siliques were opened and seeds/fertilized ovules were counted . for the staining of arabidopsis col and _PROTEIN_ pistils with stage flowers from col and _PROTEIN_ plants were emasculated and covered with a plastic wrap for a h period . the prepared pistils were mounted in half strength murashige and skoog buffer containing followed by confocal imaging using an _PROTEIN_ zeiss plan apochromat oil immersion objective . for the confocal microscopy of wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ the flowers were emasculated similarly left for various lengths of time mounted in vectashield mounting medium and observed using an _PROTEIN_ oil immersion objective . for postpollination experiments stigmas were pollinated with col pollen prior to mounting and viewing . arabidopsis _METHOD_ marker lines for the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were crossed with the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants to obtain lines with both the _METHOD_ marked compartment and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . a kb sequence upstream of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ coding region was amplified from arabidopsis genomic dna and placed in front of the gus coding sequence of the plant _PROTEIN_ vector . this construct was mobilized into agrobacterium followed by agrobacterium mediated transformation of wild type col plants using the floral dip method . the hygromycin resistant transformants were screened for gus _PROTEIN_ at various growth stages . in brief tissues were infiltrated with gus buffer for min followed by incubation for h at . the samples were then washed in ethanol mounted with a mixture of chloral hydrate water glycerol and viewed under a stereomicroscope . biolistic mediated transformation of log phase by suspension cultured cells was performed as described . single transformations were performed with a total of of purified plasmid dna and cobombardments used to of total plasmids combined . following transformations by cells were left in the dark and then harvested at h postbombardment fixed and either visualized directly for _METHOD_ proteins or treated with antibodies to detect epitope tagged proteins as described . constructs used are shown in figure . full length _PROTEIN_ was fused to myc or _METHOD_ while full length _PROTEIN_ was fused to _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was used as previously described . full length _PROTEIN_ was amplified from arabidopsis leaf cdna and cloned as an _METHOD_ fusion . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is a proteasomal _PROTEIN_ subunit . the _LOCATION_ marker concanavalin a conjugate was used at a final concentration of for the colocalization experiments . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ marker plasmids are from citation . sequence data from this article can be found in the arabidopsis genome
