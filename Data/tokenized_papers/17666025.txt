genome sequencing has resulted in the identification of a large number of uncharacterized genes with unknown functions . it is widely recognized that determination of the intracellular localization of the encoded proteins may aid in identifying their functions . to facilitate these localization experiments we have generated a series of _METHOD_ organelle markers based on well established targeting sequences that can be used for co localization studies . in particular this organelle marker set contains indicators for the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ the _LOCATION_ apparatus the tonoplast _LOCATION_ mitochondria _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . all markers were generated with four different _METHOD_ proteins _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in two different binary plasmids for kanamycin or glufosinate selection respectively to allow for flexible combinations . the labeled organelles displayed characteristic morphologies consistent with previous descriptions that could be used for their positive identification . determination of the intracellular distribution of three previously uncharacterized proteins demonstrated the usefulness of the markers in testing predicted subcellular localizations . this organelle marker set should be a valuable resource for the plant community for such co localization studies . in addition the arabidopsis organelle marker lines can also be employed in plant cell biology teaching labs to demonstrate the distribution and dynamics of these organelles .
the organelle markers in this set are based on targeted localization of _METHOD_ to specific subcellular compartments . the localization information for most constructs was provided by well established short targeting signals so that the markers did not introduce any new enzymatic activity that might alter cellular behavior . despite this attempt to provide minimal interference with cellular function it is possible that the mere presence of an overexpressed marker protein may disrupt for example the transport of normal residents of these organelles . however we have not observed any obvious deleterious effects of the marker proteins on plant growth and development after several generations . the _LOCATION_ marker was based on the targeting sequence of the small subunit of tobacco rubisco whereas mitochondrial targeting was achieved by incorporating the first aa of yeast cytochrome c oxidase iv . _METHOD_ proteins were imported into _LOCATION_ after addition of the peroxisomal targeting signal _PROTEIN_ at their c termini . _LOCATION_ localization was based on the cytoplasmic tail and transmembrane domain of soybean mannosidase i . the _LOCATION_ marker was created by combining the signal peptide of at the n terminus of the _METHOD_ and the _LOCATION_ retention signal his asp glu leu at its c terminus . the only exceptions from the use of well defined short targeting signals were the tonoplast and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ markers which were based instead on fusions to full length proteins . in particular tonoplast localization was achieved by fusing the coding region of the _METHOD_ to the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ an aquaporin of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . this approach was necessary as targeting signals for tonoplast proteins have not been established and soluble _METHOD_ in the lumen of _LOCATION_ often lack _METHOD_ signals because of the low ph of the _LOCATION_ . it should be noted that _PROTEIN_ may not label all _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ however it provides an excellent marker for the tonoplast surrounding the large central _LOCATION_ of mature plant cells . _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ labeling was based on the full length coding region of _PROTEIN_ a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ aquaporin . all markers were generated with four different _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and mcherry _METHOD_ to provide flexibility for different co localization experiments . for example the _METHOD_ based markers could be used in combination with _METHOD_ labeled proteins to test localization of the unknown protein to a specific organelle or vice versa . _METHOD_ markers can be used in double labeling experiments together with the red mcherry constructs or rhodamine labeled antibodies . all markers employ the strong and nearly ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ promoter with dual enhancer elements with the exception of the green tonoplast markers that are driven by regular promoters . the markers were constructed in two different binary _PROTEIN_ vectors for agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated plant transformation to allow for kanamycin or glufosinate selection respectively . finally the kanamycin selection plasmids were used to create stable arabidopsis lines with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ labeled organelles . both the binary plasmids and plant lines are made available through the arabidopsis stock centers . nomenclature of markers abbreviations to the left of hyphens indicate the targeted organelle the color of the construct and selection in plants is indicated on the right c _METHOD_ g _METHOD_ y _METHOD_ r mcherry k kanamycin selection b basta selection . italicized numbers _PROTEIN_ indicate _PROTEIN_ stock numbers . the labeled organelles included in this set are the _LOCATION_ the _LOCATION_ apparatus the tonoplast _LOCATION_ mitochondria _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . other organelles such as the endosomes or pre _LOCATION_ compartments have been excluded from this collection as short targeting signals have not been identified for them . furthermore the only known marker proteins for post _LOCATION_ organelles are directly involved in trafficking to or from these organelles and may interfere with the normal functioning of the organelle . the _LOCATION_ was also not included in this set as its prominent size makes identification trivial . in the following text we describe some characteristic features of the _METHOD_ labeled organelles that can aid in their identification . all images presented in this report have been generated with conventional _METHOD_ microscopy to illustrate the appearance of the organelles as seen through the eyepieces of a microscope . for an in depth introduction to live cell microscopy readers are referred to a recent tutorial . organelles in eukaryotic cells can be grouped based on their appearance in the microscope into those that are predominantly small and round and those that have a long extended morphology . organelles in the first group are typically present in many copies per cell leading to a punctate pattern of the organelle marker . the extended organelles on the other hand are usually found as a single interconnected structure that stretches throughout the cytoplasm leading to a tubular or sheet like morphology . the appearance of the organelles particularly in the second group depends critically on the position of the focal plane within the cell . in most cases visualization of the organelles in the plane of the cortical cytoplasm underlying the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ is most informative . all the organelles labeled with this set of markers with the expeption of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ show an actin myosin dependent movement in the cytoplasm . this movement is most easily recognized for punctate organelles but also occurs for the more extended organelles . _LOCATION_ are often the largest of the punctate organelles ranging in size from for proplastids to roughly for fully developed chloroplasts . whereas chloroplasts can be easily identified by their green color in bright field microscopy and by their typical red chlorophyll _METHOD_ other _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ can benefit from the organelle markers provided in this set . this is particularly relevant for epidermal cells that are usually targeted by particle bombardment or leaf infiltration and are easily accessible to _METHOD_ microscopy . in the epidermis _LOCATION_ can vary in size from cell to cell but within a cell they have a fairly uniform diameter . a unique characteristic of _LOCATION_ is the occasional presence of long tubular branches known as stromules . these stromules are extensions of the _LOCATION_ envelope that are filled with stroma and therefore contain the soluble _LOCATION_ marker . not all _LOCATION_ possess stromules but when present they can be used as an identifying characteristic . mitochondria are typically small round and are present in high copy numbers in every cell . however their morphology can vary dramatically as a result of the fusion and fission of these organelles . some cells may contain mitochondria that are a few micrometers long others may take on a worm like shape or appear as beads on a string . these different morphologies can be observed from one cell to the next but within a given cell all mitochondria display similar morphology . in rare cases thin tubular extensions so called _PROTEIN_ can be observed that appear to be similar to the stromules of _LOCATION_ . _LOCATION_ also are small typically round organelles . however unlike mitochondria and _LOCATION_ their size can vary within a single cell from < to . in photosynthetically active cells _LOCATION_ are often found in association with chloroplasts where they participate in photorespiration . the number of _LOCATION_ varies from cell to cell . the _LOCATION_ apparatus consists of a large number of small independent stacks . the individual _LOCATION_ stacks can appear as perfectly round discs as short lines or in the shape of small _PROTEIN_ depending on orientation and status . the _LOCATION_ marker may also show weak _LOCATION_ labeling resulting from the continuous recycling of _LOCATION_ resident proteins through the _LOCATION_ . the identity of the _METHOD_ spots as _LOCATION_ can also be ascertained by treatment with brefeldin a which leads to a fusion of _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and relocalization of _LOCATION_ proteins into the _LOCATION_ . however some trans _LOCATION_ proteins can also respond to bfa by forming large clusters in the perinuclear region the so called bfa compartments . the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ as the name indicates an extensive network throughout the cytoplasm . this network is best observed by focusing on the cortical cytoplasm just under the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in this case a fine network of clearly delineated tubular and sheet like _LOCATION_ elements can be discerned . the signal difference between the dark areas in the lacunae and the _LOCATION_ elements is substantial and distinct . by contrast cytoplasmic _METHOD_ would be seen as diffuse _METHOD_ . some cell types particularly in the seedling epidermis also contain bright elongated structures known as fusiform bodies or _LOCATION_ bodies . these fusiform bodies are about in length and wide and are local extensions of the _LOCATION_ that contain vegetative storage proteins . formation of fusiform bodies can be induced by wounding and depends on methyl jasmonate signaling . when fully expanded cells are viewed in a medial plane the _LOCATION_ is seen only in the thin layer of cytoplasm underneath the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and surrounding the _LOCATION_ . the cortical _LOCATION_ often takes on a _PROTEIN_ appearance resulting from its network character . the perinuclear labeling however is more uniform because the _LOCATION_ is continuous with the _LOCATION_ envelope . the _LOCATION_ marker can therefore also reveal the dynamic morphology of the _LOCATION_ . the tonoplast is the delimiting _LOCATION_ around the _LOCATION_ and in fully expanded cells stretches throughout the cell revealing the large size of the central _LOCATION_ . occasional transvacuolar strands seem to bisect the _LOCATION_ these represent cytoplasmic tunnels that traverse the lumen of the continuous _LOCATION_ and are permanently remodeled . transvacuolar strands are delimited by the tonoplast and can contain all other cytoplasmic organelles with the exception of the _LOCATION_ . some cells particularly in rapidly expanding tissues of seedlings contain circular structures of varying size inside the lumen of the _LOCATION_ . these structures are sometimes referred to as bulbs and are invaginations of the tonoplast _LOCATION_ that are continuous with the outer _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the number of bulbs per cell appears to correlate with the _PROTEIN_ level of the marker although they are also found in untransformed cells . the tonoplast is almost invisible when viewed in a focal plane close to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ because the _METHOD_ signal is more or less uniform across the field of view . however it can be visualized easily in cross section i.e . when focusing near the center of the cell . in this focal plane the _LOCATION_ may be mistaken for the tonoplast because of their largely similar distribution and the thinness of the cytoplasm in fully expanded cells . however the _METHOD_ signal of the tonoplast marker is very uniform in both intensity and _PROTEIN_ . in contrast the _LOCATION_ signal is often patterned and of variable _PROTEIN_ reflecting the distance of the tonoplast from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . another distinctive feature that allows the discrimination of these two organelles is their distribution around the _LOCATION_ . the tonoplast approaches the _LOCATION_ only on the side facing the interior of the cell whereas the _LOCATION_ is also found between the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ surrounds the cytoplasm on all sides as a single layer . hence proteins that localize to this _LOCATION_ display uniform labeling along the surface of the cell which is similar to the tonoplast but different from the patterned labeling seen for _LOCATION_ localized proteins . unlike the tonoplast _LOCATION_ however the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ does not enter the interior of the cell and is not found in transvacuolar strands or on the side of the _LOCATION_ facing the _LOCATION_ . the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker can also be used to define the area of the cell wall by identifying the surfaces of two neighboring cells . the organelle markers presented here can be used to localize uncharacterized proteins . to illustrate this process we have chosen three arabidopsis genes the products of which have not previously been examined cytologically for their intracellular distribution . some of the proteins were selected based on their predicted targeting signals whereas others were selected because their annotated location was contradicted by organelle specific proteomics . for all candidates intracellular localization was predicted by several web based _METHOD_ . coding regions of the genes were amplified from cdna and fused at the n terminus of _METHOD_ as none of the proteins contained any known c terminal targeting signals . plasmids containing _PROTEIN_ cassettes of the _METHOD_ fusions were bombarded into arabidopsis leaf epidermal cells of _METHOD_ organelle marker lines or were co bombarded with _METHOD_ based markers . in figure the _METHOD_ organelle marker is false colored magenta whereas the candidate _METHOD_ signal is false colored green . the _GENE_ gene is annotated as encoding a putative mads box protein which suggests a putative function as a transcription _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ . however several computer _METHOD_ predicted import of this protein into mitochondria . only psort gave equal probability of mitochondrial and _LOCATION_ targeting . the _GENE_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was localized predominantly in a large round area however weak diffuse _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was also detected throughout the cytoplasm . none of the organelle markers in this set matched this distribution most notably the mitochondrial marker gave a very different labeling pattern . the size of the _METHOD_ labeled spot is consistent with it being the _LOCATION_ . this interpretation was indirectly supported by comparison with the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ marker which surrounded the _GENE_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ on all sides . thus the co localization experiment corroborated the annotation of _GENE_ as a putative transcription _PROTEIN_ and contradicted most bioinformatic predictions . n.p. no prediction _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the _GENE_ gene is annotated as similar to the dag gene from antirrhinum majus which is necessary for chloroplast differentiation as well as palisade development . the prediction _METHOD_ gave nearly equal probability for chloroplast and mitochondrial localization . interestingly the _GENE_ protein was isolated with the mitochondrial proteome of suspension cell cultures . the _GENE_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was co localized exclusively with the mitochondria _METHOD_ marker confirming the proteomic data . however we can not formally exclude the possibility that _GENE_ could also be imported into chloroplasts in green tissues because we have only observed epidermal cells . the last candidate tested _GENE_ is annotated as a member of the kda peroxisomal _LOCATION_ protein gene family . most of the prediction _METHOD_ used in this study are not able to identify peroxisomal targeting sequences and instead return a wide range of different localizations . even psort the only program specifically able to predict peroxisomal targeting gave the secretory pathway as the likely localization . curiously the _GENE_ protein was identified as part of the chloroplast proteome . comparison of _GENE_ _METHOD_ labeling with the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ marker did not reveal any co localized signals . instead the fusion protein labeled larger structures reminiscent of _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ of _GENE_ _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ marker lines demonstrated limited co localization with the _METHOD_ signal forming a thin border surrounding the _METHOD_ labeled stroma . this pattern is suggestive of localization of _GENE_ _METHOD_ to the _LOCATION_ envelope _LOCATION_ . thus the experimentally determined localization is consistent with the proteomic data and contradicts the gene annotation . in summary the organelle markers lines have allowed us to quickly determine the subcellular localization of previously uncharacterized proteins . this experimental evidence of organelle targeting sometimes contradicted the computational predictions from various _METHOD_ . these discrepancies should not come as a surprise as the output of the prediction _METHOD_ is usually based on only partially defined targeting signals that allow a high degree of sequence variability . unless targeting signals are defined more precisely based on large scale localization experiments similar to those described here all prediction _METHOD_ will suffer from a high level of misinterpretation . furthermore many of the prediction _METHOD_ focus only on a subset of organelles _LOCATION_ and are therefore not useful to analyze proteins that target to other compartments . a more important conclusion from our brief survey is that the _METHOD_ fusion approach in combination with this organelle marker set can be used to efficiently test unexpected results from organelle proteomics . identification of unanticipated proteins within subcellular fractions could result either from spurious contamination or from incorrect assumptions . localization studies such as those described here can provide an independent test of the proteomic data and can thus be used to distinguish between these possibilities . a limitation of the simple approach described here is that it relies on transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ fusions in epidermal tissues . a further concern must be that the fusion site on the candidate protein should not interfere with any targeting signals necessary for proper localization . this can be avoided by sequence comparison to established targeting sequences although not all possible targeting sequences are currently known . a good general approach may be to insert the _METHOD_ moiety shortly before the c terminus of the candidate protein provided that this does not disrupt known protein domains . tissue specific targeting of the markers to different organelles does not appear to be an issue . the organelles represented in this marker set appear to rely on targeting _METHOD_ that probably exist in all cell types . we have not observed any alternative labeling patterns in a wide variety of tissues of the transgenic lines for all marker constructs . in those rare situations where an uncharacterized protein appears to target differently depending on the cell type the use of the native promoters of the candidate gene in combination with the organelle marker plants should reveal the correct intracellular localization .
all organelle markers were first assembled and tested in pbluescript based _PROTEIN_ vectors that contained _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ or mcherry respectively flanked by a double promoter and the nopaline synthase polya signal _PROTEIN_ . _LOCATION_ markers were created by amplification of the targeting signal from tobacco rubisco small subunit cdna with the primers cgagctagcatggcttcctcagttctttc and gcaggatccgctcaaatcaggaaggtatga and insertion in front of the _METHOD_ after digestion with nhei and bamhi . the mitochondrial targeting signal of yeast was amplified from genomic dna with the primers cgatctagaatgctttcactacgtcaatctataa and gcaggatccgggtttttgctgaagcagatatc and ligated in front of the _METHOD_ gene after xbai/bamhi digest . peroxisomal markers are based on published vectors similar to ours but with an additional tobacco mosaic virus translational enhancer element in front of the _METHOD_ coding region . the _PROTEIN_ sequence was encoded on a synthetic oligonucleotide _PROTEIN_ and inserted in frame at the c terminus of the _METHOD_ after bglii/xbai digest . the _LOCATION_ marker has been described previously as _METHOD_ . the _LOCATION_ marker was created by first inserting a synthetic oligonucleotide encoding hdel _PROTEIN_ at the c terminus of the _METHOD_ genes and subsequently adding the signal peptide of at the n terminus . amplification of the signal peptide from a cdna was achieved with primers cgatctagagagaagatgaaggtacaggag and gcaggatccgcactccttgcgaggttgc . the _METHOD_ tonoplast marker was a kind gift of dr nakano _PROTEIN_ and was first described by citation . to create the other _METHOD_ versions the _PROTEIN_ coding region was excised from the original plasmid with xbai/bamhi digest and ligated into _PROTEIN_ vectors encoding _METHOD_ _METHOD_ or mcherry respectively . the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker is based on a full length fusion of the aquaporin _PROTEIN_ to _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ cdna was amplified from leaf cdna using the primers acgtctagaatggcaaaggatgtggaagc and gcaggatccgacgttggcagcacttctga and inserted in front of the _METHOD_ coding region after xbai/bamhi digest . all marker plasmids were confirmed by sequencing and were tested by particle bombardment into onion epidermal peels . the _PROTEIN_ cassettes were then moved with conventional restriction digestion followed by dna ligation into two different binary plasmids and a derivative respectively . transgenic a. thaliana lines were created with the pbin based binary plasmids by the floral dip method and selected with kanamycin . _GENE_ was chosen for its predicted localization to mitochondria . _GENE_ and _GENE_ were chosen from the _PROTEIN_ database from a list of proteins that were not previously localized by _METHOD_ microscopy . for the proteins selected annotations of protein function were obtained from _PROTEIN_ and/or the gene locus information from tair . several _METHOD_ were used to predict subcellular localization and to identify potential targeting regions that could be disrupted by the translational fusion to _METHOD_ . these _METHOD_ can be accessed at the expasy website . _METHOD_ used to predict subcellular localization were _METHOD_ psort ipsort mitoprot ii and predotar . _METHOD_ for the identification of known domains and transmembrane regions were tmhmm tmpred sosui and toppred . rna was purified from a. thaliana leaves and flowers and was amplified by reverse transcriptase pcr . was amplified from flower cdna with the primers cgagctagcatgggaagaagaaaagttac and gcagacgtcgtctctcttgatgattggtgc . and were amplified from leaf cdna with the primers cgagctagcatggcgacgcatacc and gcaggatccaccctggtaggggtt or cgagctagcatgcttaactctatc and gcaggatccctttgcaacaacttc respectively . once amplified _GENE_ was digested with aatii and bamhi and _GENE_ and _GENE_ were digested with nhei and bamhi and were inserted between a double promoter and the _METHOD_ coding region of a pbluescript based _PROTEIN_ vector . as the c terminus of the encoded proteins did not contain a predicted transmembrane domain or a predicted targeting sequence we did not expect any changes in protein localization to result from these c terminal fusions . all insertions were confirmed by dna sequencing . plasmids containing the genes encoding the uncharacterized proteins and/or the organelle markers were bombarded into day old arabidopsis seedlings young leaves of week old arabidopsis or onion epidermal peels following the manufacturer s recommendations . briefly between ng and of plasmid dna was coated on of mg tungsten particles _PROTEIN_ in the presence of m and mm spermidine for at least min on a vortex mixer . plasmid coated particles were dehydrated with several ethanol washes and allowed to dry on plastic discs . particles were accelerated with a helium burst at psi in a _PROTEIN_ instrument . seedlings _METHOD_ were returned to the growth chamber and detached leaves were kept in a moist chamber in the dark . for onion epidermal peels the same procedure was followed except that tungsten particles _PROTEIN_ were used and the peels were kept on half strength _METHOD_ plates overnight in the dark . on the following day the localization of the _PROTEIN_ proteins was visualized with an axiovert m microscope equipped with filters for _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . transformed cells were first identified under a objective before representative cells were observed with a plan apo oil immersion objective . images were captured with a digital camera _LOCATION_ controlled by openlab software . after background subtraction to remove camera noise contrast enhancement was performed to increase signal intensity and remove low level background _METHOD_ . for co localization experiments _METHOD_ signals were false colored green and _METHOD_ signals were false colored magenta . photographs were subsequently processed for optimal presentation with photoshop .
