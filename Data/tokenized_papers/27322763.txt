in order to investigate the potential role of cytokinins in root gravitropism we used transgenic lines with depleted endogenous cytokinin concentrations _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and single and multiple cytokinin signaling mutants . the root gravitropic angle between the root meristem and elongation zone was measured h after gravistimulation . the angle was larger in all _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines compared with the wt suggesting slower root bending . a comparable effect was observed in single and double mutants of cytokinin receptors carrying the _PROTEIN_ allele . an increased angle also was observed in multiple _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants however this probably reflected the general root growth defects observed in these plants . we also tested exogenous cytokinin application in seedlings grown on _METHOD_ media supplemented by benzyladenine . however no difference between and plants was identifiable after h of gravistimulation suggesting the dominant role of endogenous cytokinins in the root gravitropic response . we also investigated a longer duration of gravistimulation specifically and h. on the one hand differences in the gravitropic response of cytokinin receptor single and double mutants after h were similar to those seen after h. on the other the gravitropic response was comparable to wt in all ahk single and double mutants after h of gravistimulation suggesting the transient nature of the observed phenomenon . for detailed characterization of the early events during root gravitropic bending we developed a novel approach allowing in vivo imaging using a confocal microscope nikon with optical axis . we measured several parameters of gravitropic root bending that is length of trajectory height of trajectory peak and upward and downward radius . in comparison to the control all parameters were increased in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines and in the _PROTEIN_ mutant further supporting our previous observations . altogether our findings suggest that cytokinins control the dynamics of the root gravitropic response in arabidopsis but not the ability of the root to react to changes in the gravitropic vector per se . this effect is mediated through the cytokinin signaling pathway primarily via the cytokinin receptor _PROTEIN_ . the velocity of root growth is determined by the rate of cell division in the root apical meristem cell differentiation and in particular elongation of differentiated cells leaving the root apical meristem . cytokinins have been shown to initiate cell differentiation leading to shortening of the meristem and thus reduction of the root length . however cytokinins do not seem to control the cell division rate in the root apical meristem _METHOD_ but instead negatively regulate the number of dividing cells . in order to decipher the cytokinin impact in delayed root gravitropic bending we first compared root elongation without any gravistimulation in wt _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines and cytokinin receptor single and double mutants . interestingly we observed that root growth was faster in all tested lines in comparison to wt . next we investigated the potential effect of cytokinins on cell elongation which is the dominant mechanism of root bending after gravitropic stimulation . we found that fully differentiated cells were significantly longer in _PROTEIN_ roots but not in _PROTEIN_ in comparison to wt . we also explored the potential influence of endogenous cytokinins or cytokinin signaling on reduction of root elongation . however root elongation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines after exogenously applied auxin naa displayed a response . taken together our results suggest that delayed gravitropic bending is due to the cytokinin impact on gravitropic signal perception in the columella cells or gravitropic signal transduction through the proximal meristem to the root elongation zone rather than on the cell elongation . endogenous cytokinins have previously been shown to affect the auxin distribution in the root tip . to investigate the potential role of cytokinin signaling in controlling the intercellular auxin distribution we crossed the auxin response reporter _METHOD_ with single and double mutants in cytokinin receptors . even without any gravistimulation we observed an altered auxin response distribution in the columella cells of mutant lines . three effects on the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ pattern were distinguishable in the ahk lines absence of the signal in the quiescent center signal asymmetry in columella cells and its expansion from columella into the _PROTEIN_ root cap . these differences were visible in the single _PROTEIN_ mutant and were more pronounced in both double mutant combinations containing _PROTEIN_ allele _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ revealed localization of _PROTEIN_ in the quiescent center stem cell niche columella and stele in the root tip consistent with the aberrations of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ observed in the _PROTEIN_ mutant backgrounds . thus it _METHOD_ that cytokinin signaling controls the auxin response distribution in the quiescent center and columella cells of the root tip . the cytokinin receptor _PROTEIN_ appears to play a dominant role in this process but two other cytokinin receptors _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have additive effects . asymmetric auxin distribution after gravistimulation is hypothesized to be important for unequal cell elongation at the upper and lower sides of the root thus facilitating root bending . we visualized auxin signaling distribution early after root gravistimulation using the reporter . the reporter allows sensitive visualization of auxin distribution via fast downregulation of the venus signal . in the wt we observed auxin accumulation at the lower side of the root at time although at that time there was no change in the auxin concentration identifiable at the upper side of the root . interestingly we spotted a slight increase in the auxin concentration at at both the upper and lower sides of the root . upregulation of endogenous cytokinins via application of incyde an inhibitor of cytokinin oxidase activity delimited the increase of the auxin accumulation at the lower side of the root and completely inhibited the auxin increase at the upper side of the root gravistimulated for min . this is in a good agreement with slower root bending on incyde after gravistimulation _PROTEIN_ . in conclusion these data suggest an impaired ability to redistribute auxin and delayed root bending in the gravistimulated root in response to the increase of endogenous cytokinin content . the auxin response maximum in the root meristem is to a large extent mediated by the activity of _PROTEIN_ auxin transporters . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ auxin transporters are localized in columella cells and thus presumably involved in the auxin distribution in the root tip . both of these transporters have been suggested to have an important role in root gravitropism _METHOD_ . hence we investigated the role of cytokinins in regulating the _PROTEIN_ and localization of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ in columella cells of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines . the _METHOD_ signal at _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of columella cells was lower in both the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines and in one of the tested _PROTEIN_ mutant lines . nonetheless the signal intensity of intracellular _METHOD_ was comparable to the control in all tested lines and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ niche was not changed either . in contrast to _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ signal intensities at _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were comparable in the wt _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines . however the amount of intracellular _PROTEIN_ protein was increased in the _PROTEIN_ layer and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domain had expanded _PROTEIN_ into the root cap of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines . the _METHOD_ signal in the _PROTEIN_ mutant was variable and no statistically significant differences were detected . in line with that increasing the endogenous cytokinin content via application of incyde led to upregulation of the _PROTEIN_ signal while narrowing the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ niche that is the opposite effect in comparison to transgenic lines with depleted endogenous cytokinins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . furthermore both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ signals in columella and the gravitropic bending reverted to the wt phenotype in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines after incyde treatment . to summarize our results suggest that endogenous cytokinin levels potentially may influence the intercellular auxin distribution via differential regulation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ abundance and/or localization . in addition endogenous cytokinin concentrations delimit the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ niche . _PROTEIN_ alone _METHOD_ to have no major role in these processes . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins are localized uniformly in columella cells . after gravistimulation they accumulate on the new bottom side of the cells via transcytosis . this relocalization is fast and independent of de novo protein synthesis . to assay changes in _PROTEIN_ protein localization we applied in vivo imaging using two different confocal microscopes and optical axes . _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ signals were measured at _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in columella cells of the wt _PROTEIN_ line and _PROTEIN_ mutant at and . to eliminate the effect of bleaching apparent during the time lapse imaging we evaluated the data as a signal intensity ratio between _PROTEIN_ and basal _LOCATION_ . the _METHOD_ signal intensity ratio was comparable in the wt and _PROTEIN_ lines and remained nearly unchanged up to in innermost columella cells . in outer columella cells at bottom side of the root tip the _METHOD_ signal intensity ratio was slightly increased after . however the _METHOD_ signal intensity ratio increased rapidly by in both the wt and _PROTEIN_ lines suggesting fast accumulation of _PROTEIN_ at the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ . after the rapid change observed during the first min the signal intensity ratio rose only slightly over the subsequent time points . in the _PROTEIN_ line the _METHOD_ signal intensity was slightly stronger at the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ resulting in elevation of the signal intensity ratio compared with the control . however the relocalization dynamics of _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ were similar to the control after gravistimulation . in the _PROTEIN_ line all of the tested parameters for _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were similar to control suggesting that _PROTEIN_ signaling plays only a minor function in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ relocalization in gravistimulated columella cells . interestingly the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant showed root gravitropic bending and retained sensitivity to incyde comparable to wt as well . _PROTEIN_ another member of the _PROTEIN_ family was shown to expand _PROTEIN_ in the columella in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ background potentially masking the absence of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . to inspect possible _PROTEIN_ rescue of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gravitropic response we tested the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutant . our results showed a partial defect of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in root bending after gravistimulation but retained cytokinin sensitivity in gravitropic bending . altogether we conclude that the ability of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to relocalize to _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ in response to a gravitropic stimulus remains unaffected by _PROTEIN_ endogenous cytokinin concentrations and/or attenuated _PROTEIN_ cytokinin signaling . notably _PROTEIN_ relocalization after gravistimulation is more dynamic than that of _PROTEIN_ suggesting the importance of _PROTEIN_ at very early stages after gravistimulation a notion that has not been elaborated on previously . our data also predict the existence of another cytokinin target in the control of the early root gravitropic response other than _PROTEIN_ auxin transport in the columella . the expansion of the auxin response from the columella to _PROTEIN_ root cap in plants together with the absence of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in adjacent cells and the aforementioned cytokinin sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ implies involvement of another transporter in the control over auxin distribution in the root tip . an auxin influx carrier _PROTEIN_ is localized in the columella cells _PROTEIN_ root cap epidermis and stele and was shown to be regulated by exogenous cytokinin application . that together with strong agravitropic phenotype of _PROTEIN_ made _PROTEIN_ a good candidate in our search . we compared _METHOD_ signal in wt _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines and found _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ in both lines . altogether our results indicate that endogenous cytokinins regulate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ thus controlling the velocity of auxin transport in the root tip .
