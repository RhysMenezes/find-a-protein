_PROTEIN_ of arabidopsis thaliana is a novel member of the rab/ypt _PROTEIN_ family with unique structural features . it resembles _PROTEIN_ best but lacks a large part of the hypervariable region and the cysteine motif and instead harbors an extra stretch of amino acid residues containing myristoylation and palmitoylation sites at the . _PROTEIN_ is tightly associated with _LOCATION_ and is _PROTEIN_ constitutively . in contrast the conventional ortholog _PROTEIN_ is highly _PROTEIN_ only in actively dividing cells . examination of green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ proteins indicates that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are distributed on a subpopulation of endosomes and suggests their roles in endosomal fusion . the endosomal localization of _PROTEIN_ requires fatty acylation nucleotide binding and the amino acid sequence coordinately . proteins similar to _PROTEIN_ are found only in higher plants and thus represent a novel class of rab _PROTEIN_ regulating endocytic function in a specific manner .
a novel member of the arabidopsis rab family was isolated fortuitously from a cdna library of a.thaliana during screening for other genes . the nucleotide sequence predicted a protein of amino acid residues that conserves the four consensus sequences characteristic of rab/ypt _PROTEIN_ . we thus designated this cdna _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ protein is judged by homology analysis to be most similar to proteins in the family . however _PROTEIN_ has some very unique features . first of all it lacks the region containing part of the hypervariable region and the cysteine motif . the cysteine motif is conserved in almost all rab/ypt _PROTEIN_ and its isoprenylation is essential for attachment to _LOCATION_ . the hypervariable region is important for their subcellular localization . instead of this _PROTEIN_ has an extra stretch of amino acids at the which contains putative and palmitoylation sites . the amino acid sequence of the effector domain of _PROTEIN_ which is believed to specify the function of rab/ypt proteins does not match any other proteins of this family known to date . we examined whether _PROTEIN_ does indeed hydrolyze _PROTEIN_ using a fusion protein of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed _PROTEIN_ activity and the rate of _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis was estimated to be mol _PROTEIN_ . based on literature and database searches homologs of _PROTEIN_ can be found in lotus japonicus mesembryanthemum crystallinum and oryza sativa but this type of rab/ypt protein has never been reported in mammals or yeasts . the rab subclass to which _PROTEIN_ belongs appears to be unique to plants . to determine whether the of _PROTEIN_ is in _PROTEIN_ myristoylated we performed in vitro transcription and translation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ a mutant form in which the putative myristoylation site is destroyed in the presence of myristic acid . as the source of a transcription and translation system we used wheat germ extract which contains activity . as shown in fig ref radioactivity was incorporated into the _PROTEIN_ but not the mutant _PROTEIN_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ is indeed the site of . the palmitoylation of _PROTEIN_ was also observed when _PROTEIN_ protein synthesized in vitro was incubated with the arabidopsis lysate and . incorporation of radioactivity into the _PROTEIN_ mutant protein was not observed indicating that _PROTEIN_ is indeed palmitoylated at . the _PROTEIN_ mutant was not palmitoylated either showing that myristoylation of _PROTEIN_ is a prerequisite for palmitoylation . next we examined the _LOCATION_ association of _PROTEIN_ . arabidopsis suspension cultured cells were harvested at a log phase homogenized and centrifuged at g. the supernatant was centrifuged further at g for h to separate the crude _LOCATION_ fraction from the _LOCATION_ which were subjected to immunoblotting analysis . as indicated in fig ref most of the _PROTEIN_ protein was detected in the _LOCATION_ fraction . a small amount was also found in the _LOCATION_ as is the case for a ara protein _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was not extracted from _LOCATION_ by salt but was partially extracted by urea or alkali and almost completely by triton . this property appears to be a little different from the case of _PROTEIN_ in which extraction by urea or alkali is less efficient . such a weaker _LOCATION_ association of _PROTEIN_ may reflect its unique lipid modification . as an authentic homolog in arabidopsis we cloned a novel cdna by rt pcr and named it _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ shares identity at the amino acid level to human and is identical to _PROTEIN_ another homolog of arabidopsis . in contrast to _PROTEIN_ the effector domain sequence of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is identical to that of indicating that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are orthologs . in the central part _PROTEIN_ shares identity with _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in suspension cultured cells was examined by immunoblotting analysis . as shown in fig ref and fig ref _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ throughout the culture phase and the level of protein was somewhat higher in the stationary phase . in contrast _PROTEIN_ was highly _PROTEIN_ only when cells were actively dividing . a similar _PROTEIN_ pattern was observed for _PROTEIN_ although the peak of _PROTEIN_ was noted a little earlier than that of _PROTEIN_ . fig ref shows the _PROTEIN_ of these proteins in different organs of arabidopsis . _PROTEIN_ was ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ in all organs examined whereas _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ showed organ specificities . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ abundantly in roots and suspension cultured cells . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ has a more general role than _PROTEIN_ in plant cells . _PROTEIN_ is the best known regulator molecule for the rab/ypt _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ controls both the nucleotide state and the subcellular localization of rab/ypt proteins . the isoprenylation of rab/ypt proteins at their is essential for their recognition by _PROTEIN_ . since _PROTEIN_ lacks the cysteine motif its regulation should be independent of _PROTEIN_ . this was tested by using a yeast _PROTEIN_ system . as we described previously arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ can replace the function of yeast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . yeast mutant cells transformed with _PROTEIN_ under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter depend on the function of atgdi for growth at high temperature . these cells were transformed further with a plasmid harboring _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ under the control of the constitutive promoter . if _PROTEIN_ serves to recycle ara proteins from _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ depletion of _PROTEIN_ should lead to a _PROTEIN_ of ara proteins in the soluble pool . the above transformant cells were cultured in galactose medium at for h shifted to and cultured for h to inactivate yeast _PROTEIN_ and then transferred to _PROTEIN_ medium to deplete _PROTEIN_ . cells were collected after h culture at lysed separated into supernatants and pellets and then analyzed for _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ by immunoblotting . when all _PROTEIN_ was depleted in _PROTEIN_ the soluble pool of _PROTEIN_ was almost completely lost indicating that _PROTEIN_ indeed serves to recycle _PROTEIN_ . in contrast almost the same amount of _PROTEIN_ was detected in the supernatant _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ depletion . thus _PROTEIN_ is not required for _PROTEIN_ of the soluble pool of _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ has a unique system for the regulation of its _PROTEIN_ cycle . to examine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ we transiently _PROTEIN_ a fusion protein of _PROTEIN_ and green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ in protoplasts prepared from arabidopsis suspension cultured cells . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed with a confocal laser scanning microscope developed in our laboratory . still images of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of the constitutive promoter are shown in fig ref and fig ref . _METHOD_ dots moved around in the cytoplasm very rapidly . they did not look like the _LOCATION_ apparatus because _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ proteins give larger signals in arabidopsis cells that move much more slowly . _PROTEIN_ structures were also observed often in association with a bright dot along the _PROTEIN_ . in addition faint _METHOD_ was also recognized on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in some cells . no _METHOD_ was observed in cells that were not treated with plasmids . to verify that the punctate localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ reflects the localization of endogenous protein _METHOD_ analysis was carried out . to obtain the image the cells were viewed with a confocal laser microscope fitted with a spectrophotometer for emission band wavelength selection . the antibody and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ stained the identical punctate organelles in transformed cells and the staining pattern by the antibody was very similar between transformed and untransformed cells . these results led us to conclude that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is localized correctly in arabidopsis cells . for comparison we examined the localization of _PROTEIN_ tagged with _METHOD_ at the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . if _PROTEIN_ is a true counterpart of it is expected to reside on early endosomes . as shown in fig ref _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was localized predominantly on the rapidly moving punctate organelles . _PROTEIN_ structures were observed occasionally . thus _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ yielded very similar _METHOD_ structures which were most probably early endosomes . the lipophilic styryl dye is known to follow the endocytic pathway from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ via endosomes to the _LOCATION_ when exogenously added to yeast cells . we tried to use this chemical to analyze endocytosis in plant cells . the protoplasts of the arabidopsis suspension culture cells were incubated with for min washed and resuspended in the culture medium containing m mannitol . just after labeling stained the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and invaginations of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in some populations of cells . half an hour _PROTEIN_ this dye was internalized and localized to small punctate structures in almost all cells whose size and motility were almost indistinguishable from those visualized by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ structures emerged following the punctate organelles which were also seen in the case of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . at h after labeling _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ became _METHOD_ and at h > of cells showed _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ staining . after h of incubation was completely transported to the _LOCATION_ . these results strongly support the notion that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are localized to the organelles in the early step of the endocytic pathway . to confirm the endosomal localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ we examined _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and simultaneously . arabidopsis protoplasts transiently _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were labeled with incubated for min and viewed with a confocal microscope . at this time point stained only the organelles in the early endocytic pathway . as shown in fig ref the small motile dots and the _PROTEIN_ structures visualized by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were both stained with . this demonstrates that the organelles where _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ resides are indeed early endosomes . interestingly _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was not localized on all early endosomes visualized by . _PROTEIN_ structures which were marked by but barely stained by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were also observed . these findings suggest that arabidopsis has at least two distinctive populations of early endosomes . next we investigated whether the mutations of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ that alter their characteristics as _PROTEIN_ affect their intracellular localization . we first constructed _METHOD_ fusions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which correspond to and are expected to be stabilized in the _PROTEIN_ state . when these fusion proteins were _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis cells predominant _METHOD_ was observed on aggregates of _PROTEIN_ structures the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and small dots . _METHOD_ on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was also observed in some populations of cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . in contrast _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ never stained the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . we again performed a experiment and confirmed that aggregating vesicles were positive for both markers before the large central _LOCATION_ became stained with . these results suggest that the constitutive active mutants of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ accelerate the fusion of early endosomes to form aggregates of larger _LOCATION_ structures . these aggregating _LOCATION_ may well represent _PROTEIN_ endosomes or the compartment which are promoting fusions further and forming even larger _LOCATION_ . alternatively this _METHOD_ may reflect faulty recycling of the mutant proteins . in the case of mammalian cells the mutant of which is known as a key regulator of homotypic fusion of early endosomes also promotes the formation of larger endosomes when overexpressed . taken together the above results led us to propose that the novel rab/ypt protein _PROTEIN_ functions as a regulator of _LOCATION_ fusion in the endocytic pathway of arabidopsis cells . _PROTEIN_ should also be a regulator of endocytic _LOCATION_ fusion . currently we are examining whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function on the same endosome . the endosomal localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ more stringent than that of _PROTEIN_ . we will discuss this point further below . the dominant effects of the _PROTEIN_ mutants also suggest that _METHOD_ fusions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ retain their functions as is the case for other rab _METHOD_ fusion proteins . we also examined the role of fatty acylation in the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ . we constructed _METHOD_ mutant _PROTEIN_ which contained an amino acid substitution in _PROTEIN_ and/or and _PROTEIN_ them transiently in arabidopsis cells . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which has _PROTEIN_ where occurs but can not be a substrate for palmitoylation was localized _PROTEIN_ on the _LOCATION_ but not on the endosomes . this result indicates that can direct _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ but palmitoylation is essential for the correct localization to the endosomes . both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were localized in the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ which is the same pattern as found for free _METHOD_ indicating that is essential for _LOCATION_ binding . thus _PROTEIN_ is attached to the _LOCATION_ via fatty acylation and both and palmitoylation are essential for localization of _PROTEIN_ on the endosomes . then is the region sufficient to locate _PROTEIN_ on the endosomes ? to answer this question we analyzed whether the amino acids of _PROTEIN_ containing fatty acylation sites could direct the _METHOD_ fusion protein to the endosomes . the amino acids of _PROTEIN_ were added to the of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ which was then _PROTEIN_ in the suspension cultured cells . as shown in fig ref it was localized _PROTEIN_ on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and occasionally on punctate structures . these results indicate that the region of _PROTEIN_ is not sufficient for the predominant endosomal localization . as hitherto demonstrated the sequence of _PROTEIN_ is important but not sufficient for localization on early endosomes . in the mutational analysis of _PROTEIN_ we found that the mutant of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ corresponding to the mutant of rash did not localize to early endosomes . interestingly _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ resided predominantly on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ like _METHOD_ suggesting that nucleotide binding is also important for the endosomal localization of _PROTEIN_ . to determine the minimal regions of _PROTEIN_ that direct endosomal localization we constructed a chimeric protein consisting of the amino acids of _PROTEIN_ the central part of _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . this chimera was not localized to the endosomes but on unknown types of small structures . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ yielded patterns of _PROTEIN_ structures and bright dots . these dots most probably represent the _LOCATION_ apparatus as reported previously and the _PROTEIN_ may be identical to those visualized by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or . the structures on which _METHOD_ was localized also often looked like _PROTEIN_ but they were smaller in size than the _PROTEIN_ organelles . the identities of these organelles have yet to be determined . as a possible region of _PROTEIN_ that contains additional targeting information we looked at its part . the hypervariable region is known to be the determinant of localization for conventional rab/ypt proteins . to examine the role of this part we replaced the part of _PROTEIN_ in the _METHOD_ chimera by the corresponding region of _PROTEIN_ containing either eight or amino acid residues . we _PROTEIN_ these chimeric proteins in arabidopsis cells and found that the eight amino acids of _PROTEIN_ can localize the chimeric protein to punctate organelles of high motility . these motile organelles were labeled by after min demonstrating that is localized on early endosomes . the chimera with the amino acids of _PROTEIN_ was also localized on the motile endosomes although some populations occasionally marked the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . thus the eight amino acids of _PROTEIN_ could locate the chimeric protein to the early endosomes . in this region _PROTEIN_ shows some similarity to three out of eight residues are conserved . this conserved region may contain common information for early endosome localization . taking the above results together _PROTEIN_ employs a unique mechanism for localization on early endosomes . fatty acylations nucleotide binding and the region all appear to be required to determine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ in a coordinated fashion .
the open reading frame of _PROTEIN_ was amplified by pcr to generate bamhi sites at both ends and subcloned into . this recombinant plasmid which directs synthesis of the _PROTEIN_ protein fused to the of _PROTEIN_ was introduced into escherichia coli . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was induced by purified from the lysate by affinity chromatography on a glutathione sepharose column and used to raise a polyclonal antibody in rabbits . the of this antibody was tested for lysates from yeast cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . immunoblotting analysis detected _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ . for the antibody a synthetic _PROTEIN_ peptide in which _PROTEIN_ shows no homology to any other known arabidopsis rab proteins was used to immunize rabbits . the antibody obtained was purified by protein g affinity column chromatography and was confirmed to have no with _PROTEIN_ . in vitro transcription and translation was carried out with the tnt coupled wheat germ extract system according to the manufacturer 's instructions . for myristoylation assay linearized _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cloned in the pbsiisk vector were used as templates and myristic acid was added to the reaction . after

for h to separate the crude _LOCATION_ fraction from the _LOCATION_ . for solubilization of _PROTEIN_ the fraction was resuspended in _PROTEIN_ buffer plus m nacl m urea m or triton and allowed to stand on ice for h. samples were then centrifuged at g for h to separate soluble from insoluble fractions and subjected to immunoblotting analysis with an polyclonal or an monoclonal antibody . total

ecl plus system . media for yeast cultures were described previously . for the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in yeast their orfs were first placed under control of the constitutive promoter in . the fragment containing the promoter _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ terminator was cut out by bamhi and sali and subcloned into _PROTEIN_ which is a plasmid containing the _PROTEIN_ marker . cells of _PROTEIN_ were transformed with this plasmid and further transformed with a plasmid containing _PROTEIN_ under control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter and the marker . transformants were cultured in minimal galactose medium at for h shifted to for h and then transferred to minimal _PROTEIN_ medium or again to minimal galactose medium . cells were collected after h culture at resuspended in saline containing protease inhibitor cocktail and vortexed vigorously with glass beads . after centrifugation at g for min to eliminate debris samples were adjusted to mg protein/ml and centrifuged at g for min to obtain supernatant and pellet fractions . each sample was analyzed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and immunoblotting . and mutant versions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which were constructed by mutagenesis were fused to the orf of _METHOD_ in the directions _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . the fusion genes were subcloned into which is a derivative of pbsiiks containing the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter and the nos terminator . transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ ara proteins in arabidopsis suspension cultured cells was performed by the method described previously with minor modifications .
