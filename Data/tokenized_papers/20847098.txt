_PROTEIN_ is a _PROTEIN_ domain protein potentially involved in multiple stress regulation in arabidopsis . as in most _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is encoded by a single intronless gene . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is tightly regulated both at the transcriptional and post translational levels . it has been shown previously that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ in plant cell can be detrimental and the protein was detected in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ stacks contrasting with previous findings and suggesting a mitochondrial subcellular localization for this protein . to ascertain these findings immunocytochemistry and aba induction were used to demonstrate that in plant cells physiological levels of _PROTEIN_ colocalized with _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ localized protein in plant cells . in addition _METHOD_ protein tagged _PROTEIN_ was targeted to the secretory pathway and did not colocalize with mitotracker labelled mitochondria . these results suggest that the polytopic _LOCATION_ protein _PROTEIN_ is cotranslationally targeted to the _LOCATION_ in plant cells and accumulates in the trans _LOCATION_ network . heterologous _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast devoid of _PROTEIN_ related protein resulted in growth defects . however subcellular fractionation and immunoprecipitation experiments showed that _PROTEIN_ was targeted to mitochondria where it colocalized and interacted with the outer mitochondrial _LOCATION_ porin _PROTEIN_ reminiscent of the subcellular localization and activity of mammalian translocator protein kda _PROTEIN_ . the evolutionarily divergent _PROTEIN_ appears therefore to be switching its sorting mode in a species dependent manner an uncommon peculiarity for a polytopic _LOCATION_ protein in eukaryotic cells . these results are discussed in relation to the recognition and organelle targeting _METHOD_ of polytopic _LOCATION_ proteins in eukaryotic cells .
the experimental evidence for plant _PROTEIN_ subcellular localization is scanty most of the studies so far concluding to a mitochondrial localization . the only direct evidence of the subcellular localization of a plant _PROTEIN_ protein came from the studies by et al . who used a polyclonal antibody against murine _PROTEIN_ and transmission electron microscopy of digitalis lanata leaf cells presumed to _PROTEIN_ a plant _PROTEIN_ and showed that the detected gold particles thus the antigens were in both chloroplasts and mitochondria . however western blot experiments suggested that the polyclonal antibody used cross reacted with many plant proteins which is not surprising since the primary sequence of plant and animal _PROTEIN_ share not more than identity . recently subcellular fractionation immunocytochemistry and _METHOD_ protein tagging approaches were used and it was shown that _PROTEIN_ is targeted to the secretory pathway in plant cells and can be detected in the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ stacks . however most of these experiments were conducted with samples overexpressing the protein since _PROTEIN_ was not detectable in vegetative tissues from plants grown under unstressed conditions . in addition the untagged protein was not colocalized directly with a genuine marker of the early secretory pathway as definitive proof of this unanticipated subcellular localization . to address these limitations advantage was taken of the specific and affinity purified antibodies generated against _PROTEIN_ and the aba dependent induction of the protein in plant cells . arabidopsis cultured cells were probed with anti _PROTEIN_ and antibodies against the arabidopsis thaliana adp ribosylation _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ can be detected in _LOCATION_ stacks in plant cells and its immunodetection has been used before to identify this organelle in plant cultured cells . shows representative confocal images resulting from co immunodetection of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in the wild type cells were probed with anti _PROTEIN_ followed by anti _PROTEIN_ and the _LOCATION_ are highlighted by dapi staining . no _PROTEIN_ could be detected in the wild type cells _PROTEIN_ consistent with previous studies showing that _PROTEIN_ is undetectable in proteins extracted from wild type arabidopsis cultured cells grown under normal conditions . a transgenic cell line was generated _PROTEIN_ n terminally tagged _PROTEIN_ with histidine _PROTEIN_ under the control of the promoter . _PROTEIN_ was immunodetected in these cells _PROTEIN_ in punctuate structures with fluorescein isothiocyanate derived _METHOD_ also labelling the _LOCATION_ envelope . the signal from _PROTEIN_ perfectly colocalized with that of _PROTEIN_ . it was checked that the pattern of the signal obtained with this sequential double immunodetection was consistent with those obtained separately with each antibody assessed alone . the perfect colocalization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ derived signals suggest that the overexpressed _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ . none of the punctuate structures labelled by anti _PROTEIN_ was devoid of anti _PROTEIN_ . although unlikely specific targeting of _PROTEIN_ to the secretory pathway may result from mislocalization due to overexpression of a _LOCATION_ protein as occasionally reported for other proteins . to check this possibility the endogenous protein was induced in cultured arabidopsis wild type cells by incubating them for h in the presence of aba followed by immunodetection of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . shows that both proteins were essentially detected in punctuate structures as in the transgenic overexpressing line and the merged signals perfectly colocalized suggesting that here also _PROTEIN_ is a _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ localized _LOCATION_ protein . it is therefore concluded that when _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is sorted to the _LOCATION_ and transported to _LOCATION_ stacks in plant cells through the secretory pathway . thus _PROTEIN_ is an early secretory pathway _LOCATION_ protein in plant cell . _PROTEIN_ colocalizes with _PROTEIN_ in plant cells . wild type cells were probed with anti _PROTEIN_ and texas red coupled anti rabbit secondary antibody then with anti _PROTEIN_ coupled to fitc the cells were mounted in antifade medium containing dapi and imaged sequentially with a confocal microscope using an oil immersion lens . no fitc signal could be detected in wild type cells . a transgenic cell line overexpressing _PROTEIN_ was treated as in a fitc derived signal could be seen _PROTEIN_ and the merged image showed a perfect colocalization with the texas red derived signal . wild type cells were pre incubated in aba before probing as in the fitc derived signal could be seen and perfectly colocalized with the texas red derived signal as in . to check this conclusion independently mitochondria in arabidopsis transgenic plants overexpressing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were stained with the mitochondria specific dye mitotracker . a representative confocal image of a leaf epidermal cell is shown in . the merged panel in clearly demonstrates that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and the mitotracker signal did not colocalize . the software was used to analyse in detail the colocalization of the two signals in acquired time lapse series . as shown in supplementary fig . at jxb online the two signals are on different organelles with a pearson 's coefficient below on average . a single eukaryotic translation product can occasionally be targeted to more than one organelle . these results clearly support the conclusion that _PROTEIN_ is not in addition to the organelles of the early secretory pathway partially localized to the _LOCATION_ . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is not targeted to mitochondria in plant cells . confocal images of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and mitotracker imaged simultaneously as a time lapse the two signals are not colocalizing as shown in the merged panel . functional and structural studies of _LOCATION_ proteins usually require heterologous overexpression of the proteins in question . s. cerevisiae is a common host in this respect not only as a means to generate enough material for biochemical and structural studies but also to search for potential protein partners . _PROTEIN_ domain containing proteins are found from archaea to metazoans with very few exceptions notably the bakers yeast s. cerevisiae . however the topology of animal _PROTEIN_ was obtained after heterologous _PROTEIN_ in yeast since the subcellular localization of the protein was conserved in yeast and mammalian cells . for biochemical characterization of _PROTEIN_ the plant protein was _PROTEIN_ in yeast driven by the inducible _PROTEIN_ promoter . to facilitate its affinity purification a histidines tag was added at the c terminus _PROTEIN_ or the n terminus _PROTEIN_ . as a control the yeast strain was also transformed with the empty vector _PROTEIN_ . the presence of _PROTEIN_ in the yeast total protein extract was checked by western blot using the affinity purified _PROTEIN_ specific antibodies . the growth of the ev strain was first compared with that of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the presence of _PROTEIN_ as the _PROTEIN_ source _PROTEIN_ or galactose _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . growth was assessed by a time course recording of the of the cells grown in liquid minimal synthetic medium with galactose or by a fold dilution series of cells grown in liquid minimal medium with _PROTEIN_ then spotted on sdgal plates . the experiments were repeated at least three times and representative data are presented in . when _PROTEIN_ was used as the sole _PROTEIN_ source growth of the three strains was similar in liquid culture or after the serial dilution drop tests on plate . no _PROTEIN_ could be detected in total protein extracts of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . when _PROTEIN_ was replaced by galactose in the growth media _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ could be detected . interestingly the relative growth of strains _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was substantially reduced as compared with the ev control . the size of the colonies generated by cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ was smaller as compared with those of the ev strain at each tested dilution indicating clearly that _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in s. cerevisiae reduces cell growth . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in yeast reduces cell growth . yeast strains _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ growth monitored by nm absorbance either in sd _PROTEIN_ medium or sd galactose medium . the same yeast strains growth was also monitored through a serial dilution drop test lower panels in and show the detection by western blot of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ after growth in sd _PROTEIN_ or sd galactose . ev _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ stand for transgenic yeast transformed with respectively the empty vector _PROTEIN_ vector containing n terminal tagged version of _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ vector containing c terminal tagged version of _PROTEIN_ . the filled squares are for the ev strain the filled circles for _PROTEIN_ and the open circles for _PROTEIN_ . as shown above and in previous studies when _PROTEIN_ in plant cells _PROTEIN_ is targeted to the early secretory pathway . there was speculation that this subcellular localization was conserved in yeast as for the mammalian _PROTEIN_ . when _PROTEIN_ in yeast mammalian translocator protein _PROTEIN_ is targeted to the _PROTEIN_ . to check the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in yeast subcellular fractionation experiments were conducted after h and h of _PROTEIN_ induction . total microsomes were separated from the _LOCATION_ and the former were used in a sucrose gradient to isolate fractions enriched in different subcellular _LOCATION_ . yeast and _PROTEIN_ were used as a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and a _LOCATION_ lumen marker respectively as _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ as _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker and _PROTEIN_ as the mitochondrial marker . _PROTEIN_ was not detected in the soluble protein fraction . western blot analyses of the sucrose gradient derived fractions are presented in . shows that h after _PROTEIN_ induction the protein co sedimented in the gradient with _PROTEIN_ and both proteins peaked in fraction . similar results were obtained at the h time point with some _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ also detected in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ enriched fractions . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in yeast is _PROTEIN_ targeted to the mitochondria and with time some of the protein may reach the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to confirm this observation total microsomes were submitted to acid dependent precipitation resulting in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ enriched and mitochondria enriched fractions . these fractions were probed for the enrichment of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker and the mitochondria marker _PROTEIN_ . shows that for the two _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ strains the _PROTEIN_ enrichment was concomitant with that of _PROTEIN_ . by contrast shows that while was enriched in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fractions of all the samples analysed _PROTEIN_ was not . these results support the conclusion that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are colocalized in the same biological _LOCATION_ which is not the _LOCATION_ or the _LOCATION_ . total microsomes from strain _PROTEIN_ were solubilized and subjected to nickel affinity chromatography . shows an example of affinity purification of _PROTEIN_ resulting in co purification of some _PROTEIN_ . similar results were obtained for _PROTEIN_ . in control experiments _PROTEIN_ from the ev strain was not detected in the elution fraction suggesting that _PROTEIN_ retention by ni _PROTEIN_ requires _PROTEIN_ . the eluted fraction was separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the polypeptides stained with colloidal blue . two major bands were detected one below kda and the other around kda . these two stained polypeptide bands were manually excised in gel digested with trypsin and the resulting peptides purified and subjected to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis . the higher mr band was identified as yeast _PROTEIN_ through four resulting _METHOD_ peptides and the lower mr band was identified as _PROTEIN_ from three resulting _METHOD_ peptides . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is the major co purifying protein with _PROTEIN_ . subcellular fractionation and _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in yeast . lysed spheroplasts were separated on a discontinuous sucrose gradient and fractionation was performed by centrifugation . immunodetection of _LOCATION_ markers _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ marker _LOCATION_ marker sec mitochondria marker _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ strain h after induction . the asterisk indicates the sedimentation peak of each protein . immunodetection of _LOCATION_ markers _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ marker _LOCATION_ marker sec mitochondria marker _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ strain h after induction . immunodetection of _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ marker _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ and mitochondria marker _PROTEIN_ of the empty vector transformed strain h after induction . enrichment of _PROTEIN_ in purified yeast microsomal fractions . tm stands for total microsomes the ratio values > indicates an enrichment and < indicates impoverishment with respect to the tm . immunoblot analysis of the mitochondria enriched fraction prepared from the strains _PROTEIN_ either the n terminal tagged version of _PROTEIN_ or the c terminal tagged version of _PROTEIN_ anti _PROTEIN_ is used as a positive control . immunoblot analysis of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ enriched fraction prepared from the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ yeast strains _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and the strain transformed with the empty vector ev . anti protein is used as a positive control for _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . yeast _PROTEIN_ copurifies with _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in yeast was solubilized from total microsomes and affinity purified using a ni _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with microsomes from the yeast strain transformed with the empty vector used as control . the input flowthrough _PROTEIN_ the three successive washes and the elution fraction were analysed by immunoblotting for the presence of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ and as control _LOCATION_ proteins . the elution from _PROTEIN_ strain or the empty vector strain were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ alongside mr markers after blue colloidal staining of the polypeptides the _PROTEIN_ bands in lane were excised and in gel tryptic digested and the resulting peptides analysed by maldi tof/tof the identified peptide for each polypeptide are shown on the right with their start and end in the primary sequence of the _METHOD_ identified protein . from the data presented above _PROTEIN_ localization in yeast is reminiscent of that of mammalian _PROTEIN_ . since mammalian _PROTEIN_ can form oligomeric complexes with the porin vdac there was speculation that this may also be the case for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in yeast . a check was made for possible protein protein interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ by co immunoprecipitation . shows that when the solubilized microsomes from _PROTEIN_ strain were incubated with anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies _PROTEIN_ was detected in the eluted immuno complex but the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein was not . in a reversed experiment immunoprecipitation with anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies resulted in co immunoprecipitation of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was not detected in the elution fraction from the ev protein extract . taken together these results establish firmly that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in yeast is targeted to the _PROTEIN_ where it interacts with _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interact physically . _PROTEIN_ specific antibodies or _PROTEIN_ specific antibody were used to generate an immunocomplex of their respective antigen from total protein extracts from yeast transformed with the empty vector or _PROTEIN_ . the immunocomplexes were coupled to protein a beads the input flowthrough _PROTEIN_ the last wash and the eluted fraction were analysed by immunoblotting . to verify the specificity of the interactions a check was made for the presence of a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein in the immunocomplexes .
