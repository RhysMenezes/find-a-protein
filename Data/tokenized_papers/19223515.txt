plasmodesmata traverse the cell wall to establish a symplastic continuum through most of the plant . rapid and reversible deposition of callose in the cell wall surrounding the pd apertures is proposed to provide a regulatory process through physical constriction of the symplastic channel . we identified members within a larger family of domain containing proteins that targeted to pds . this subgroup of proteins contains signal sequences for a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage to the _LOCATION_ face of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . we focused our attention on three closely related members of this family two of which specifically bind to _PROTEIN_ in vitro . we named this family of proteins pd callose binding proteins . yellow _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ was found to localize to the neck region of pds with potential to provide a structural anchor between the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ component of pds and the cell wall . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ had overlapping and widespread patterns of _PROTEIN_ but neither single nor combined insertional mutants for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ showed any visible phenotype . however increased _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ led to an increase in callose accumulation and a reduction of green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ movement in a _METHOD_ diffusion assay identifying a potential association between pdcb mediated callose deposition and plant cell to cell communication .
previous work identified a series of _LOCATION_ associated proteins from cell wall preparations of arabidopsis suspension cells . as part of a survey of the subcellular targeting of these proteins as fusions to _METHOD_ markers we have identified _GENE_ as a gene encoding a novel pd protein . because of its associated callose binding activity we have named this protein pd callose binding protein _PROTEIN_ . _GENE_ encodes a gpi anchor protein with n and c terminal domains that are cleaved during processing from the preprotein . to establish the subcellular location of _PROTEIN_ the yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ coding sequence was cloned between sequences encoding the n terminal secretion signal and the region for the mature protein . since gpi anchor proteins are usually covalently attached to the gpi moiety in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and become located on the _LOCATION_ face of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ was selected owing to its greater stability in the more acidic environment of the apoplast . transgenic _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ from the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis resulted in spots of _METHOD_ located on the walls of epidermal cells in expanded leaf tissues in a pattern widely interpreted as pd labeling . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a similar pattern was seen after transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in nicotiana benthamiana plants . in addition in spongy mesophyll cells the _METHOD_ spots were restricted to wall to wall connections between neighboring cells . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ a similar pattern of _METHOD_ was observed in transgenic arabidopsis plants accumulating _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ following _PROTEIN_ from its native promoter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . confirmation that these spots were wall associated was obtained following plasmolysis when the _METHOD_ was spatially distinct from the retracted protoplast . interestingly plasmolysis often resulted in _METHOD_ being leached into the apoplastic space a technical problem that was resolved by preincubation of the tissues with a phospholipase c chemical inhibitor . gpi anchors are highly susceptible to stress induced phospholipase c providing independent evidence that _PROTEIN_ is a gpi anchor protein . unlike some viral movement proteins that only associate with complex pds _PROTEIN_ in tissue development _PROTEIN_ was also observed as punctate labeling on new division walls close to _METHOD_ . for example microscopy of newly divided epidermal cells behind the root meristem of transgenic arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ showed _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ located on the anticlinal division walls . absolute confirmation that these punctate patterns represented the _PROTEIN_ protein located at pds was obtained using immunolocalization . anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies were used to probe tissue sections prepared for electron microscopy . since _GENE_ in wild type plants was predicted to be _PROTEIN_ only weakly in leaves tissues for electron microscopy were prepared from _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic arabidopsis immunogold labeling of wild type tissues gave no significant labeling . immunogold labeling of transgenic lines showed that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was located at the outer neck region of pds where callose becomes deposited and not through the central region . quantification of the gold labeling showed a strong preponderance for labeling associated with pds and significantly less background labeling elsewhere in the cell . control preimmune serum showed no significant labeling at these positions . furthermore using aniline blue staining and confocal microscopy we demonstrated that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ precisely colocalized with pd associated callose . _PROTEIN_ encodes a kd protein with additional n and c terminal signal sequences that direct the protein to the external face of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ where the mature protein is secured through a covalent gpi anchor . the amino acid sequence of mature _PROTEIN_ reveals two domains a c terminal unstructured domain rich in pro residues and an n proximal domain . homology searches of the arabidopsis genome identified _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ and _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ which shared > amino acid sequence similarity with _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ also has been identified biochemically as a gpi anchor protein . phylogenetic analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ and fall within a tight cluster of seven proteins among a larger cluster of similarly structured proteins that lack the gpi anchor signal sequence and within a larger superfamily of proteins which includes proteins with domains adjacent to _PROTEIN_ catalytic domains . the domain is characterized by a conserved distribution of six cys residues and a phe residue and likely plays a role in _PROTEIN_ binding . to explore the potential for _PROTEIN_ related proteins to also target pds _METHOD_ fusion proteins were created for the two closest homologs to _PROTEIN_ and for two additional proteins that represented the diversity of the _PROTEIN_ related gpi family . hence _METHOD_ pdcb _PROTEIN_ constructs were made for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ _GENE_ resides in a neighboring subclade to _PROTEIN_ and _GENE_ is more distantly related with an unclear phylogenetic association with _PROTEIN_ . all these constructs were _PROTEIN_ transiently in n. benthamiana . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _GENE_ and _METHOD_ were also _PROTEIN_ as stable transgenics in arabidopsis no such lines could be obtained for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . in tissues _PROTEIN_ these constructs the proteins again were observed in a punctate pattern of _METHOD_ around the periphery of the cell . as for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ these punctae were restricted to cell to cell contact zones in spongy mesophyll colocalized with callose and were retained on the cell wall after plasmolysis . these data suggest that many or all of the _PROTEIN_ related gpi proteins could constitute this family of pd proteins . the protein domain is present in a diverse range of arabidopsis proteins including as a nonenzymatic ancillary domain to some of the _PROTEIN_ . citation showed that an protein ole from olive pollen had callose binding activity . mature ole comprises just the domain and is phylogenetically distinct from the pdcb family being more closely related to the non gpi proteins . recently the three dimensional structure of the related ole protein has been established by _LOCATION_ magnetic resonance . using a protein threading algorithm the putative structure of the _PROTEIN_ domain was compared with the structure of ole . the domain of _PROTEIN_ showed amino acid similarity with ole . the two structures were congruent pointing to a common function for the two domains . to assess biochemically whether like ole _PROTEIN_ might show callose binding activity the mature protein lacking the n and c terminal signal sequences was _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli and assessed for its interaction with _PROTEIN_ in a gel retardation assay . the protein was _PROTEIN_ with thioredoxin fused to the n terminus to enhance its solubility with an intervening histidine tag to assist protein purification . protein extracts were subjected to affinity chromatography followed by gel filtration . we were unsuccessful in our attempts to purify the _PROTEIN_ domain alone as a thioredoxin fusion . purified was electrophoresed through a nondenaturing gel into which selected polysaccharides had been incorporated . bsa and thioredoxin neither of which binds to polysaccharides were run in parallel as internal negative controls . in the presence of laminarin _PROTEIN_ the migration of thioredoxin _PROTEIN_ was reduced relative to bsa and thioredoxin and relative to migration in the absence of laminarin . thioredoxin _PROTEIN_ retardation was proportional to the concentration of laminarin . retarded migration was also observed with hexalaminarin _PROTEIN_ . no change in migration was seen when laminarin was replaced with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or lichenan _PROTEIN_ . to determine if this activity was a unique property to _PROTEIN_ or whether other pdcb homologs might also bind to callose we also _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and similarly in e. coli and assayed the purified fusion proteins by nondenaturing gel retardation . relative to the negative control thioredoxin _PROTEIN_ also showed retardation and therefore callose binding activity binding activity for thioredoxin _PROTEIN_ could not be measured as it appeared to aggregate resolving only as higher _METHOD_ material in the gel . the similarity in structure between pdcb proteins and their common in vitro activity _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ suggested that they could cover redundant functions in vivo . for this to be the case the genes should show overlapping patterns of tissue specific _PROTEIN_ . the public _PROTEIN_ data point to strong tissue specific _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and in the vegetative/floral apex with weaker _PROTEIN_ in the vegetative organs . to formally assess the _PROTEIN_ patterns for _PROTEIN_ and pdcbpro _PROTEIN_ constructs were transformed into arabidopsis and transformed seedlings were stained histochemically for gus activity . gus staining of multiple independent lines showed consistent _PROTEIN_ patterns that generally reflected the aggregated public data . activity for _PROTEIN_ was consistently lower than for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ although the overall patterns of activity were similar . gus staining was most intense in the shoot apical region and in young leaves but activity was still readily detected in the laminar and vasculature of mature leaves . to address the consequences of reduced _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and we obtained t dna insertional mutant lines for _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ and _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ . because of potential _METHOD_ with functional redundancy crosses between mutants for _GENE_ and _GENE_ were also made . insertional mutant lines for _PROTEIN_ listed for the gabi kat and riken collections could not be confirmed . hence we also used artificial micrornas in an attempt to generate transgenic lines with reduced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . constructs designed to target two independent sites within the _PROTEIN_ gene inserted into the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant failed to give rise to any lines with significantly reduced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in a complementary strategy we transformed wild type plants with constructs _PROTEIN_ untagged _PROTEIN_ constitutively from the camv promoter arabidopsis plants similarly _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ had been generated previously . immunoblot analysis of leaf tissues from transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the unfused _PROTEIN_ showed increased accumulation of _PROTEIN_ . accumulation of tagged _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ had been visualized previously as _METHOD_ _METHOD_ located at pds . neither the single nor double insertional mutant lines for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ showed any morphological or developmental phenotypes probably reflecting functional redundancy with _PROTEIN_ . for the overexpression lines hemizygous _PROTEIN_ lines showed normal growth and development . by contrast homozygous lines produced stunted floral _PROTEIN_ which were frequently dead shortly after the production of an influoresence under normal plant culture conditions and were generally infertile . a key tool for assessing potential roles for proteins in pd function is the use of monomeric soluble _METHOD_ as a reporter of molecular flux through pds by passive diffusion . this is conveniently achieved by measuring the diffusion of _METHOD_ from a point of initial _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ following bombardment of _METHOD_ into the leaves of plants with altered _PROTEIN_ of the genes in question . to assess any impact of altered pdcb _PROTEIN_ on pd function insertional mutant and overexpression lines were subjected to the _METHOD_ diffusion assay following bombardment with gold particles cocoated with plasmids encoding _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . the spread of _METHOD_ was monitored at h after bombardment in comparison to that observed in wild type plants . when single and double mutant lines of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were tested no change in _METHOD_ diffusion was observed . by contrast _METHOD_ diffusion in _PROTEIN_ hemizygous plants measured at and h after bombardment was significantly less than in wild type plants . equivalent data were obtained for plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . since overexpression of proteins can give rise to pleiotropic effects as an additional control we assessed _METHOD_ diffusion in transgenic plants overexpressing the gene for an unrelated gpi anchor protein fasciclin like protein _PROTEIN_ not targeted to pds . these plants showed no change in _METHOD_ diffusion compared with wild type plants . since bioinformatic analysis of the pdcb proteins failed to predict any associated catalytic activity it was not immediately apparent why increased pdcb _PROTEIN_ should lead to altered molecular flux through pds . however we had shown that thio pdcb proteins through their domains bind to callose at the pd neck region and callose deposition in this location had been shown to regulate trafficking of molecules through pds . in addition for some _PROTEIN_ the domain exists as a c terminal ancillary domain and changes in _PROTEIN_ activity have been shown to affect both active and passive cell to cell trafficking . hence we asked whether plants overexpressing pdcb proteins might show altered callose accumulation . when leaf tissue from _PROTEIN_ plants was stained with aniline blue and visualized by confocal microscopy these lines were seen to contain more callose than nontransgenic segregant lines . visually more intense aniline blue staining indicated increased callose accumulation . following computational quantification of representative images it was confirmed that lines overexpressing the unfused _PROTEIN_ contained significantly more callose than the wild type . callose deposition at pds and at phloem sieve plates is frequently associated with applied chemical and physiological stresses . since changes in pdcb _PROTEIN_ also led to increased callose deposition we investigated whether _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ or was responsive to applied stresses . public array _PROTEIN_ data did not however indicate any consistent changes for these genes across a wide range of treatments . to validate these public data the _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ and were assessed by quantitative rt pcr following treatment with heat and after wounding _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively were used as positive controls for the effects of the treatments . heat treatment showed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ after h at and no change for _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ confirming the existing public data . there were no changes in the _PROTEIN_ of pdcb genes in response to wounding .
the coding sequence for _METHOD_ was cloned as a translational fusion between the n terminal signal sequence and the rest of the cds for pdcb using overlap pcr and gateway cloning technology . forward and reverse primers for _METHOD_ and two sets of pdcb primers were used . and amplified the n terminal signal sequence . contained sequences that partially overlapped the gateway primers and a kozak translational consensus start site and contained a region overlapping _METHOD_ . and amplified the rest of the cds . contained a region overlapping _METHOD_ contained a stop codon and partially overlapping sequence with the gateway primers . all fragments were amplified separately and then joined by overlap pcr in two stages . fragments were amplified from a cdna clone of _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ using ex taq . the first pcr reaction using primers and _METHOD_ fused _METHOD_ to the n terminus of _GENE_ but downstream of the n terminal signal sequence . a second pcr used gene nonspecific gateway primers to reconstitute the attb sites and fuse the n _METHOD_ to the rest of the coding sequence . the pcr product was recombined into the gateway vector using _PROTEIN_ clonase ii mixture and transformed into escherichia coli . this strategy was repeated for the homologs _GENE_ _GENE_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ . the sequence of the resulting pdonr constructs was verified . coding sequences for _METHOD_ tagged pdcb and related proteins were transferred from pdonr into the gateway binary destination vector using lr clonase ii resulting in _METHOD_ fusions . the constructs were transformed into agrobacterium tumefaciens to be used for transformation of arabidopsis thaliana col or transient _PROTEIN_ in nicotiana benthamiana . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct was created by overlap pcr of two fragments _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was amplified from the pdonr _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ using primers and _GENE_ . _PROTEIN_ was amplified from genomic dna using primers _GENE_ and _GENE_ . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct was inserted into the promotorless gateway vector _GENE_ . the pdcbpro gus constructs were created by amplification of the pdcb promoter regions from genomic dna using the following primers sets _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ . the three promoter regions were cloned into the vector using gateway technology . transgenic pdcbpro gus seeds were sown onto murashige and skoog _METHOD_ plates . after d when the first true leaves had fully expanded the seedlings were removed and washed in water . gus assay solution _PROTEIN_ was vacuum infiltrated into the seedlings . after overnight incubation in the dark at the seedlings were washed several times in ethanol to clear the tissues . images were taken using a zeiss stemi microscope _PROTEIN_ with a cannon powershot camera . to validate the public _PROTEIN_ data set wild type seedlings were heat treated by incubating whole seedlings grown on solid _METHOD_ media for h at or were wounded by injuring the leaf tissue using broad tweezers wounded tissue was harvested after h. total rna was extracted from treated leaf samples and subjected to quantitative rt pcr following cdna synthesis using superscript ii . the analysis followed the sybr green jumpstart protocol and data were collected using an opticon monitor . biological and technical replicates were analyzed statistically using the software rest _PROTEIN_ . significance values were set at p value < and _PROTEIN_ values with more than twofold change . in all cases elongation _PROTEIN_ subunit was used as a reference gene . positive controls for wounding and heat shock were _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . overnight cultures of a. tumefaciens containing _METHOD_ fusions were washed and resuspended in mm mm acetosyringone at . the solution was infiltrated into expanded leaves of week old n. benthamiana plants . arabidopsis col plants were transformed using the flower dip method as described in by citation . the localization of _METHOD_ tagged proteins was assessed using a leica dm irb inverted confocal microscope _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was viewed with excitation and emission wavelengths of nm and to nm respectively . fully expanded leaves from month old transgenic arabidopsis col plants were viewed . before plasmolysis leaves were pressure infiltrated with a mm solution of o tricyclo dec yl dithiocarbonate potassium salt which inhibits phospholipase c so preventing stress induced cleavage of gpi linkages . this was left for h before the leaves were plasmolyzed by infiltration with a solution of glycerol . plasmolyzed leaves were viewed immediately . to correlate _PROTEIN_ location with callose leaves as above were pressure infiltrated with a v/v mixture of aniline blue and m glycerol at ph and viewed after min using excitation and emission wavelengths of nm and to nm respectively . leaf areas within the infiltrated area were selected at random . to quantify callose accumulation in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines confocal images were subjected to intensity analysis performed under nonsaturating excitation levels using the image processing software _PROTEIN_ version . this was performed in two complementary ways . either the gray values of individual aniline blue stained foci were compared between the lines and wild type col or the size of the foci was compared . for each treatment a total of data sets were collected from separate images . for each image the four brightest _METHOD_ foci were used . as the data did not show a normal distribution statistical analysis was done using a mann whitney hugh test using minitab version software . the identification of the sequences for n terminal secretion and gpi signals was predicted using signal p and dgpi respectively . the domains of pdcb were identified using pfam domains and prosite . _PROTEIN_ structure of the _PROTEIN_ domain was predicted using fugue and . potential pdcb promoter regions were identified with the promoter prediction server tf search and softberry . homologs of the pdcb protein were identified using blast . the homologs were aligned using clustalw and were manually annotated using genedoc . the phylogenetic tree and bootstrap values were obtaining using phylip version . bootstrap values were the product of trials . the cds of the mature _PROTEIN_ or or thioredoxin were cloned between the ncoi and ecori sites of after pcr amplification using and primers . these primers included the ncoi and ecori restriction sites for cloning and a translational stop codon in the reverse primer . the resulting clone was transformed into the e. coli and the insert was verified by dna sequencing . this clone was transformed into e. coli des plyse strain for protein _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ from the vector results in a protein fused to an n terminal thioredoxin protein with increased pdcb solubility . between the thioredoxin and the pdcb sequence there was a tag to aid purification . as a control empty _PROTEIN_ thioredoxin alone was processed in parallel . for protein _PROTEIN_ and purification bacterial cultures were grown with shaking at to od to and then induced using mm isopropyl beta thio galactopyranoside . the temperature was reduced to and the bacteria left to grow overnight . the resulting bacteria were collected by centrifugation resuspended in buffer and disrupted using a french press . after centrifugation at the soluble fraction was retained . his tagged protein was purified from the soluble fraction by fast protein liquid chromatography using a ml hitrap chelating hp column . the pdcb containing fractions were further purified using an amersham hiload superdex gel filtration column and the resulting pdcb protein was concentrated using a centricon ym concentrator . thioredoxin pdcb binding to complex _PROTEIN_ was assessed using gel retardation assays as described by citation . briefly nondenaturing _PROTEIN_ gels were prepared containing to mg/ml of different polysaccharides _PROTEIN_ cellulose in the separating gel . lichenan was mixed with water at room temperature to dissolve low molecular weight sugars which were then discarded . the remaining polysaccharide was solubilized in water by heating at for min . cm cellulose also required heating at for min for solubilization . then of thioredoxin pdcb and thioredoxin alone were loaded onto the gel and electrophoresed at v for h at room temperature . bsa was run as an additional negative control . the proteins were visualized using _METHOD_ brilliant blue staining polyclonal antibodies for _PROTEIN_ were raised in rabbits using protein acquired by _PROTEIN_ of tagged _PROTEIN_ from the vector . the cdna was pcr amplified to eliminate the n terminal signal peptide and gpi anchor signal region using the primers and . the clone was transformed into e. coli des plyse strain for protein _PROTEIN_ . the insoluble protein was isolated from washed inclusion bodies by solubilization in m urea and purified using affinity chromatography as described above for thioredoxin _PROTEIN_ . immunogold labeling for _PROTEIN_ was achieved using anti _PROTEIN_ antibody diluted and a rat anti rabbit antibody conjugated to nm gold particles . sections were processed following a short igl protocol based on that described by aurion . in brief all solutions were filtered except the aurion blocking buffer . all of the steps were performed on clean parafilm unless otherwise stated . grids were floated section side down on drops of mm glycine/pbs for min and then immersed in aurion blocking buffer for a further min . sections were then equilibrated with two drops of bsa tween over min . the primary antibody was diluted in solution a and grids were floated on to drops for h at . the grids were then washed in solution a five times over min and then floated on secondary antibody diluted in solution a for a further h at . grids were washed with _PROTEIN_ and water for min each and then stained for h by floating on drops of uranyl acetate on clean dental wax . after washing in water five times and air drying labeled sections were examined using a jeol transmission electron microscope . crude protein extracts from transgenic and wild type plants were separated on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gels and the separated proteins were electroblotted onto immobilon p . _PROTEIN_ specific proteins were revealed using the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody diluted and alkaline phosphatase conjugated anti rabbit secondary antibodies and incubation with the chromogenic substrates . arabidopsis col insertional mutant lines were obtained for _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ and _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ . confirmation that these were knockout lines was obtained by sequencing both ends of the insertion sites and by rt pcr to analyze the specific transcribed rnas no rna was detected from three replicate plants for each line . a combined knockout was also generated by crossing . we also attempted to generate _PROTEIN_ rnai lines in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant background using the artificial mirna strategy laid out by citation . sequences for predicted target sites at coding nucleotides to _PROTEIN_ and to _PROTEIN_ were included in hairpin constructs inserted into the
