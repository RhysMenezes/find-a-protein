a _PROTEIN_ task in the study of the secretory pathway is the identification and localization of new proteins to increase our understanding of the functions of different organelles . previous proteomic studies of the endomembrane system have been hindered by contaminating proteins making it impossible to assign proteins to organelles . here we have used the localization of organelle proteins by the isotope tagging technique in conjunction with isotope tags for relative and absolute quantitation and liquid chromatography for the simultaneous assignment of proteins to multiple subcellular compartments . with this approach the density gradient distributions of proteins from arabidopsis thaliana were determined enabling confident and simultaneous localization of proteins to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ apparatus _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or mitochondria and _LOCATION_ . this parallel analysis of endomembrane components has enabled protein steady state distributions to be determined . consequently genuine organelle residents have been distinguished from contaminating proteins and proteins in transit through the secretory pathway .
protein localization by lopit is based on the principle that proteins belonging to the same organelle cofractionate after equilibrium density gradient centrifugation of subcellular _LOCATION_ . here we have increased the resolution and protein coverage of the lopit technique by quantifying distributions of protein within a gradient by using itraq labeling in conjunction with liquid chromatography of peptides followed by tandem _METHOD_ itraq enables relative protein levels in four samples to be determined in a single _METHOD_ experiment . in this case two overlapping four plex itraq comparisons were carried out across the region on iodixanol density gradients where the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ apparatus _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and pm were enriched . the itraq reagent has an n hydroxysuccinimide ester group which reacts with peptide n termini and the primary amines of the c terminal lysines of tryptic peptides . the itraq reagent also contains a balance _PROTEIN_ group and a pendant reporter group . the distribution and between the reporter group and balance group differs in the four versions of the itraq reagent such that the reporter group _METHOD_ differ successively by da . when an itraq labeled peptide is subjected to collision induced dissociation the itraq tag fragments between the reporter group balance group and the peptide . the balance group is uncharged and therefore is not present in product ion spectra . the reporter group however retains a proton and the resulting reporter ions derived from the four versions of the itraq reagent appear at m/z m/z m/z and m/z in each product ion spectrum . peptide quantitation is achieved by comparing the peak areas of these reporter ions . in this study the reporter ion areas indicate relative protein levels in the four itraq labeled density gradient fractions . to test the reproducibility of the lopit approach and to improve the accuracy of protein localization two independent density gradient separations of arabidopsis _LOCATION_ were performed and two itraq comparisons were performed on each . two dimensional liquid chromatography of peptides followed by tandem _METHOD_ analysis of the itraq labeled samples resulted in the identification of proteins in the first experiment and in the second experiment . the proteins identified as being common to both experiments were used in subsequent analyses . each protein was quantified in all four itraq labeling experiments . quantitation of peptides common to two or more homologous proteins could lead to misleading localization results particularly if the proteins reside in different organelles . only peptides unique to a single identified protein therefore were quantified . for proteins where two or more peptides were quantified the percentage standard deviation _PROTEIN_ of the itraq ratios was calculated as a measure of technical _LOCATION_ . the average _PROTEIN_ for the first experiment was and for the second experiment . the relative itraq reporter ion intensities indicate distributions of individual proteins in the density gradient . reporter ion spectra for known _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ pm mitochondrial and _LOCATION_ apparatus proteins are shown in fig . a e. the profiles of these marker proteins are clearly distinct demonstrating that residents of these organelles can be distinguished despite the _PROTEIN_ that pure organelle preparations were not obtained . localization of previously undescribed proteins is achieved by matching their profiles to the marker profiles . for example the uncharacterized protein _GENE_ exhibits a very similar profile to the _LOCATION_ apparatus marker and therefore is most likely localized within the _LOCATION_ apparatus . for each of the identified proteins six reporter ion ratios were derived from each of the two four plex comparisons from each of the two experiments yielding data points for each protein . clearly manual analysis of such a data set is not possible therefore principle components analysis was used as a data reduction tool and to identify patterns within it . initially pca was performed on the two repeat experiments independently to confirm that protein clustering was reproducible . the data from the two experiments were then combined and pca performed on the entire data set resulting in the reduction of the combined data set to a two variable scores plot . the principal component scores for each protein describe the position of that protein in relation to these two new axes or principal components and the other proteins contributing to the model . the pca scores plot represents a map of all proteins within which proteins with similar density gradient distributions and therefore localizations are clustered . annotation of proteins with known localizations in arabidopsis revealed the presence of five _PROTEIN_ clusters corresponding to mitochondria/plastids _LOCATION_ apparatus _LOCATION_ pm and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . a literature survey was conducted to annotate a further proteins with predicted localizations based on sequence homology or the presence of motifs characteristic of a specific localization . the pca positions of these proteins were examined . the predicted localizations of of these proteins were confirmed based on their positions on the pca scores plot relative to the organelle marker proteins . the localizations of the remaining six proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are discussed below . summary of localization results pca alone is not suitable for assigning proteins to organelles because it is not possible to determine the positions and the shapes of the boundaries that define the organelle clusters . consequently partial least squares discriminant analysis _PROTEIN_ which is a technique for classifying observations in multidimensional data sets based on training sets of observations with known class memberships was used . the organelle markers and the confirmed organelle proteins were grouped into five classes corresponding to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ apparatus pm _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and mitochondria/plastids and were used to build a _PROTEIN_ da model . this model predicted the class memberships of the identified proteins . the classification was further cross referenced by checking the positions of the classified proteins on the pca scores plot . based on their high similarity to the pca scores and the reporter ion profiles of the organelle marker proteins proteins were manually reclassified at this point . using this approach proteins in total were assigned subcellular localizations to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ apparatus pm _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or mitochondria/plastids . density gradient distributions of proteins assigned to the five classes are shown in fig . . proteins assigned to the same class have very similar profiles thus demonstrating the validity of the multivariate classification approach . the proteins that were not classified could belong to organelles that were not included in the _PROTEIN_ da training set such as the prevacuolar compartment . the nonclassified proteins also could represent proteins localized to multiple compartments . the density gradient distributions and therefore pca scores of these proteins are combinations of the density gradient profiles of the different organelles in which they reside . for example if of a protein was targeted to the _LOCATION_ and to the _LOCATION_ apparatus then the protein probably would cluster with the _LOCATION_ markers . however a protein distributed equally between the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ apparatus may exhibit an intermediate distribution and would most likely be unclassified after _PROTEIN_ da analysis . the possibility of the intermediate distribution matching another organelle profile can not be excluded however there is no evidence to suggest that codistribution has occurred in this study . the distinct itraq profiles and pca scores of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ apparatus pm _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and mitochondria/plastid markers confirmed the validity of the lopit technique for distinguishing proteins resident in these organelles . to further confirm the utility of the lopit approach localizations of previously uncharacterized proteins representing targeting predictions to each of _LOCATION_ apparatus _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and pm were verified by microscopy . in all proteins were fused to _METHOD_ and the fusion proteins _PROTEIN_ in nicotiana tabacum leaves . the subcellular distribution of each was then determined by confocal microscopy . sixteen of the _METHOD_ fusions were targeted as predicted two were not targeted as predicted and targeting of four fusions was inconclusive because although there was _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ the subcellular structure marked was not assignable to a distinct organelle . _METHOD_ fusions to proteins predicted to target the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ apparatus were shown to colocalize with known markers for these organelles as further demonstration of the lopit approach . the false positive rate of localization of proteins to organelles by using the lopit approach from this relatively small data set thus could be estimated at .
arabidopsis thaliana callus cultures were established and _PROTEIN_ as described in ref . citation . _LOCATION_ were prepared and fractionated by using self generating iodixanol density gradients . two independent _LOCATION_ preparations were performed . density gradient fractions were _PROTEIN_ washed . _LOCATION_ were pelleted by centrifugation washed and repelleted . _LOCATION_ were solubilized in of mm triethylammonium bicarbonate m triton x _PROTEIN_ . protein concentrations were determined by using the bca protein assay kit . two four plex itraq comparisons _METHOD_ were performed across the first of the fractions collected from each _LOCATION_ preparation . comparison a fraction was labeled with itraq reagent fraction with fraction with and fractions and with . comparison b fraction was labeled with itraq reagent fraction with fraction with and fractions and with . samples were reduced _PROTEIN_ and cysteines blocked . samples were diluted such that the urea concentration was < m digested with trypsin overnight at and lyophilized . lyophilized samples were resuspended in of m ethanol added to one unit of the corresponding itraq reagent and incubated for h at . residual reagents were hydrolyzed with of water . the labeled peptides from each itraq comparison were then pooled and lyophilized . see supporting methods for more details . _METHOD_ data files were processed by using which converts _PROTEIN_ data files into text files that contain m/z and intensity information for each product ion spectra . each _METHOD_ data file was processed twice to generate first centroided peak lists that contain a single m/z value for each ion corresponding to the center of the peak and second uncentroided peak lists that contain m/z information for the entire peak . mascot _PROTEIN_ was used to search centroided peak lists against the mips arabidopsis protein database . the modifications used were as follows fixed itraq itraq _PROTEIN_ variable oxidation itraq . the _METHOD_ tolerance was da and the _METHOD_ tolerance was da . the mascot search results comprise a list of peptide identifications each of which has a score that indicates the quality of the result . to determine the minimum peptide mascot score for accurate protein identification each peak list was searched against a version of the arabidopsis database in which the protein sequences were reversed . the identifications that resulted from the reversed database search were used to calculate the false protein identification rate false protein identification rate number of proteins identified from the reversed search/number of proteins identified from the normal search mascot peptide scores of at least and for the first and second experiments respectively resulted in false protein identification rates of < for proteins containing at least two peptides . normalized itraq reporter ion ratios were calculated from the uncentroided peak lists by using the recently developed i tracker . normalized reporter ion areas were calculated as follows normalized area a area a/ . the genome annotating proteome pipeline system was used to parse peptide identification and scoring information from the mascot output files and link these identifications to the quantitation data in a relational database . peptides were quantified if at least three of the reporter ion peaks were above a threshold of counts and if they had a mascot score of at least . in addition only peptides that were unique to a single identified protein were quantified . itraq ratios were imported into simca logged and preprocessed with unit variance scaling . pca and _PROTEIN_ da were performed as described previously except that five organelle classes were used for the _PROTEIN_ da training set . for protein classification by _PROTEIN_ da the lowest scoring training set proteins were used as the threshold for class membership . see supporting methods and table for more information .
