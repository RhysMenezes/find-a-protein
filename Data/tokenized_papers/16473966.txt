arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ embryogenesis receptor like _PROTEIN_ is a leucine rich repeat receptor like kinase _PROTEIN_ involved in the acquisition of embryogenic competence and in male sporogenesis . to determine the composition of the _PROTEIN_ signaling complex in vivo we generated plants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ protein fused to cyan _METHOD_ protein under _PROTEIN_ promoter control . the _LOCATION_ receptor complex was immunoprecipitated from seedlings and the coimmunoprecipitating proteins were identified using liquid chromatography/matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of the trypsin released peptides . this approach identified two other lrr _PROTEIN_ the brassinosteroid _PROTEIN_ receptor and its coreceptor the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ associated protein . in addition kinase associated protein phosphatase _PROTEIN_ and were found . finally the mads box transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and an uncharacterized zinc finger protein a member of the _PROTEIN_ family were identified as part of the _PROTEIN_ complex . using blue native gel electrophoresis we show that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are part of _PROTEIN_ containing multiple protein complexes with relative _METHOD_ between and kd . the _PROTEIN_ mutant allele _PROTEIN_ enhances the phenotype of the weak _PROTEIN_ allele _PROTEIN_ . collectively these results suggest that apart from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is also involved in the brassinolide signaling pathway .
to purify and detect the _PROTEIN_ protein and its interacting partners directly from seedlings c terminal _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins were stably _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis wild type plants under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter as described . the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was identical to that of a previously characterized _PROTEIN_ yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion protein . similar to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants no unusual phenotype was observed whereas introduction of the same _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct used here in the _PROTEIN_ knockout mutant background restored the male sterility phenotype of the double _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant . this finding _METHOD_ that the fusion protein did not interfere with its endogenous counterpart and was fully functional . total proteins extracted from d old _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and after blotting on a _LOCATION_ the fusion proteins were detected with anti green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ antibody . the same protein extract was detected with anti _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ kinase antibodies which recognize endogenous _PROTEIN_ as well as the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins confirming the specificity of the anti _METHOD_ antibodies . after immunoprecipitation an aliquot was analyzed with anti _METHOD_ antibody to confirm that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was indeed recovered in the immunoprecipitation . a band of kd was recognized only in protein extracts of the transgenic line and not in extracts of wild type seedlings . to identify proteins that bind to _PROTEIN_ as extracted from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings we subjected the immunoprecipitated proteins to trypsin digestion . to reduce the influence of ion suppression effects in maldi _METHOD_ measurements and obtain more peptide peaks separation of the tryptic peptides by reverse phase column chromatography was performed before subjection to maldi _METHOD_ measurements . as a negative control samples obtained from an immunoprecipitated protein extract from wild type seedlings with anti _METHOD_ antibody were analyzed in the same way by lc/maldi _METHOD_ . a representative lc/maldi _METHOD_ spectrum recorded for fraction from the lc fractions obtained after trypsin digestion of the immunoprecipitated _PROTEIN_ complex is shown in figure . in figure a spectrum recorded for fraction of the trypsin digested immunoprecipitated negative control extract is shown . all _METHOD_ to charge ratio values also present in the negative control _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were removed from the m/z list . the remaining values were then compared with the predicted tryptic peptide _METHOD_ for the arabidopsis proteome as described in methods . the top panels in figures to show four representative spectra expanded from the spectrum shown in figure that led to the identification of the _PROTEIN_ interacting partner . the peaks with m/z and are predicted with one phosphorylated residue present . the peak with m/z has the same predicted peptide sequence as that predicted for m/z but without phosphorylation of the ser residue . the same peptide sequence but now extended by two missed tryptic cleavage sites is predicted for the peak with m/z . the bottom panels in figures to show the corresponding expanded spectra recorded for the negative control sample shown in figure . the combined results of comparable analyses performed for the list of remaining m/z values were used to compile the list of identified proteins these are presented in table . as expected _PROTEIN_ was identified as part of the complex . this identification was based on tryptic peptide matches and a mascot score of . all of the peptides found covered the kinase domain of _PROTEIN_ and are located on the exterior of the protein including the phosphorylated peptides based on the structural model for _PROTEIN_ . none of the peptides matched the sequence of the _LOCATION_ domain which may be attributable to posttranslational modification by glycosylation or to the presence of two disulfide bounds between the four cys residues present making trypsin digestion more difficult . one peptide could be identified in which the oxidation of met had occurred whereas three other peptides were identified that were modified by phosphorylation . the second receptor in the _PROTEIN_ complex was identified as the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ protein . lc/maldi _METHOD_ fingerprint analysis revealed tryptic peptide m/z values from both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but because of the high homology in their protein sequences of of the predicted m/z values match with the sequences of both proteins . five peptides unique for _PROTEIN_ were identified three without and two with modification by phosphorylation . based on inspection of the model of _PROTEIN_ structure four of the five _PROTEIN_ specific peptides identified are from a region also yielding peptides used for the identification of _PROTEIN_ . this finding corroborates the identification of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ interacting proteins identified by maldi _METHOD_ for _PROTEIN_ which is homologous with _PROTEIN_ at the protein level five m/z values are identical for both proteins . no m/z values unique for _PROTEIN_ were found . the third receptor found in the _PROTEIN_ complex was the _PROTEIN_ receptor identified on the basis of peptides most of them covering the kinase domain . most of the peptides identified with phosphorylations were also found as nonphosphorylated or as oxidized peptides which provides additional evidence for identification as the _PROTEIN_ protein . because _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is reported to be the coreceptor of _PROTEIN_ the presence of both of these receptors suggests that there is a direct link between _PROTEIN_ activity and brassinolide signaling . in addition to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ several other proteins were found that were previously reported to interact with _PROTEIN_ and therefore were expected to be present in the _PROTEIN_ immunoprecipitated complex . one of them is arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ which was shown to interact only with a catalytically active kinase domain of _PROTEIN_ involving thr . in a yeast two hybrid screen two other proteins were found to interact with the kinase domain of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and . maldi _METHOD_ fingerprint analysis indeed revealed tryptic peptides derived from _PROTEIN_ . in our search rather then was identified with a high score after searching even with the complete m/z list . apparently only these two members of the large arabidopsis family of proteins can interact with the _PROTEIN_ receptor . finally two unexpected proteins were found . the first is the mads box transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the second is a putative _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ like b box zinc finger protein . the zinc finger protein is annotated as one large amino acid protein and also as a shorter protein of amino acids . we only found peptides covering the shorter protein . to validate that the proteins described above indeed interacted with _PROTEIN_ we treated control samples with _PROTEIN_ or with m nacl before coimmunoprecipitation to destroy protein protein interactions . the resulting list of m/z values revealed only the presence of the _PROTEIN_ protein . finally we used our coimmunoprecipitation procedure with the _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ receptor and the _METHOD_ tagged integral _LOCATION_ protein _PROTEIN_ . for _PROTEIN_ the resulting m/z lists did not reveal the presence of any of the _PROTEIN_ interacting proteins listed in table . therefore we conclude that the coimmunoprecipitation/lc/maldi _METHOD_ procedure for identifying protein complexes in arabidopsis presented here is reliable and identifies specific interacting partners . to confirm our results obtained by lc/maldi _METHOD_ we used coimmunoprecipitation and flim based analysis to detect the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and its interacting partners in vivo . _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ was immunoprecipitated with anti _METHOD_ antibodies and the precipitated proteins were detected using anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies . a band with the expected mobility of _PROTEIN_ was visualized that was absent in an immunoprecipitation of wild type plants with the _METHOD_ antibody . _PROTEIN_ antibodies recognize endogenous _PROTEIN_ as well as _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins and can precipitate _PROTEIN_ from a total plant protein extract . the _PROTEIN_ antibodies are specific for _PROTEIN_ because they do not detect a band of the expected mobility for _PROTEIN_ in a protein extract from seedlings of the strong _PROTEIN_ allele . reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation with anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies revealed the presence of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the coimmunoprecipitated proteins . previously we showed that fret can be detected between _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ when transiently _PROTEIN_ in cowpea protoplasts . coexpression of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ results in a change of the steady state distribution of both receptors as a result of accelerated endocytosis . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ can form heterodimers with either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ we used a similar transient assay in protoplasts to detect fret by flim . in figure we show the _METHOD_ intensity images of protoplasts transfected with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ alone _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ together with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ together with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the corresponding _METHOD_ lifetime images are compared in panels iv to vi in figure . the results presented in figure show that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ heterodimerize in small patches in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as indicated by the significant reduction in the average lifetime from to ns of the donor _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ molecules in those areas indicated by the arrowhead . a similar phenomenon was described for the _PROTEIN_ heterodimers . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ also formed heterodimers with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as shown by the green _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in figure that corresponds to an average lifetime of ns for the donor _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ molecules . thus colocalization in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the ability to form heterodimers in plant protoplasts strongly suggest that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ can be part of the same complex in intact plant _LOCATION_ . to confirm the in vivo interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ we coimmunoprecipitated _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis tissue cultured cells with anti _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ kinase antibodies . the precipitated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies . a band with the expected mobility for monomeric _PROTEIN_ was detected in the total protein extract and in the immunoprecipitated sample showing that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ indeed coimmunoprecipitates with _PROTEIN_ . no _PROTEIN_ band was detected in the negative control using rabbit preimmune serum for immunoprecipitation . similarly the presence of a protein in the complex with _PROTEIN_ in vivo was verified by coimmunoprecipitation with _METHOD_ antibodies of _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ followed by immunodetection with anti antibodies . no band was detected in the negative control using wild type seedlings for immunoprecipitation . the antiserum can recognize in vitro produced as well as confirming that _PROTEIN_ can interact with both and _METHOD_ . a summary of the experiments providing additional evidence for the presence of proteins in the _PROTEIN_ complex is shown in table . analysis of the single t dna insertion mutant _PROTEIN_ an allele that produces a kinase dead receptor protein did not reveal a morphological plant phenotype . therefore we crossed the _PROTEIN_ allele into the weak _PROTEIN_ mutant allele _PROTEIN_ . this allele contains the missense mutation in the island domain of _PROTEIN_ . at the seedling level d old _PROTEIN_ mutants exhibit mild morphological characteristics of the phenotype conferred by _PROTEIN_ such as small seedlings short petioles and round dark green inwardly curved true leaves . _PROTEIN_ plants developed smaller compact rosettes compared with wild type plants . the weak _PROTEIN_ allele is a semifertile dwarf that has less reduced stature compared with severe _PROTEIN_ alleles . the _PROTEIN_ mutation clearly enhanced all _PROTEIN_ associated phenotypes especially the length of the petioles and excessive inward curling now seen in d old seedlings of the double mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as well as a reduction in the size of the rosette . the inflorescence length of the double _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant was also reduced . for comparison we also introduced the _PROTEIN_ mutation an allele of the _PROTEIN_ coreceptor into _PROTEIN_ . the resulting _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant had even smaller rosettes and grew with a severely reduced stature resembling strong _PROTEIN_ alleles . this finding indicates that the _PROTEIN_ mutation had an even stronger effect on _PROTEIN_ than did _PROTEIN_ . to rule out the possibility that the observed modification of the phenotype conferred by _PROTEIN_ by the _PROTEIN_ allele is attributable to the introduction of the columbia ecotype into the enkheim background we also combined the _PROTEIN_ mutant allele which shows no morphological alterations from the wild type with _PROTEIN_ . the resulting _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants were indistinguishable from _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ of inflorescence length and rosette width demonstrating that there is no effect of the columbia ecotype . these results provide genetic evidence that _PROTEIN_ is involved in _PROTEIN_ signaling and confirm the role of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gene as a _PROTEIN_ coreceptor . in previous studies we showed that _PROTEIN_ is located at the _LOCATION_ in protoplasts and in plants and can directly interact in vitro and in vivo with _PROTEIN_ and and in vitro with _PROTEIN_ . the results presented here confirm the previously observed interactions and show that _PROTEIN_ can be present in a complex with several other proteins . it is not clear whether the _PROTEIN_ complex harbors all of the proteins listed in table at the same time or that we immunoprecipitated multiple _METHOD_ of the _PROTEIN_ complex . different _METHOD_ could exist in different cell types or in different subcellular locations such as _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or after internalization . to determine the size of the _PROTEIN_ complex in planta microsomal preparations from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings and wild type seedlings were solubilized with triton x and subjected to blue native _PROTEIN_ . in this technique _METHOD_ dyes and aminocaproic acid are used to induce a charge shift and improve the solubilization of _LOCATION_ associated proteins . to detect _PROTEIN_ within the potential protein complex single lanes of the bn _PROTEIN_ gel were cut and mounted on a denaturing _PROTEIN_ gel . after electrophoresis the gel was subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti _METHOD_ antibody or anti _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ kinase antibody . using _METHOD_ standards of the protein complex containing _PROTEIN_ was determined to have a mean relative _METHOD_ of kd . the remaining appears to exist as a complex with a mean _METHOD_ of kd . the maximum size is kd . this variability in protein complex size is also seen when the tagged _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ complex is detected by anti _METHOD_ antibodies . approximately of the _METHOD_ tagged complex has a mean _METHOD_ of kd and has a _METHOD_ of kd . although there is a clear difference in the mean size of the complex with and without the _METHOD_ tag we can not precisely estimate whether this difference is kd _METHOD_ or kd _METHOD_ . the results show that there is one abundant core complex for _PROTEIN_ of kd . we first examined whether _PROTEIN_ was part of the core _PROTEIN_ complex . therefore a microsomal fraction prepared from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants was examined for the presence of _PROTEIN_ proteins . _PROTEIN_ was found in complex with the same size range of to kd as the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins . in contrast with _PROTEIN_ most of the _PROTEIN_ protein was found as probably a homodimeric form of kd . the occurrence of potential _PROTEIN_ homodimers is consistent with our observation of _PROTEIN_ homodimerization in protoplast and was recently shown in plants . the observed smaller and higher _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ are probably attributable to the recognition of differentially processed _METHOD_ . the distribution of _PROTEIN_ in the microsomes prepared from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants was then studied by bn _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was found in complex with the same size range as _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are indeed present in the _PROTEIN_ kd core complex and are also present in complexes of higher molecular _METHOD_ . no signal was detected when solubilized microsomes from wild type seedlings were analyzed for the presence of _METHOD_ confirming that the signals observed in figures and are indeed derived from microsomal _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . collectively the results obtained from bn _PROTEIN_ suggest that the core _PROTEIN_ complex of kd as well as the larger complexes consist of the _LOCATION_ receptors _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . assuming that all proteins listed in table are present as monomers a predicted size of kd is obtained . although this is about the maximum size of the _PROTEIN_ complex as estimated by bn _PROTEIN_ it exceeds the size of the predominant complex of kd . in summary we propose that in arabidopsis seedlings a core _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ complex consists of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . collectively this would amount to kd when all proteins are present as monomers or between and kd in a more conventional tetrameric arrangement . this is clearly in the range of the observed sizes on bn _PROTEIN_ gels . _PROTEIN_ interacts only with the active _PROTEIN_ receptor and could represent one of the less abundant higher molecular _METHOD_ _METHOD_ .
arabidopsis thaliana ecotype columbia was used as the wild type . seeds were surface sterilized and sown on germination medium . seeds were kept for d at and then transferred to a growth chamber . seedlings were grown at under h h dark periods for d. arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ receptor fused to _METHOD_ under the control of its native promoter were similar to the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants described previously by citation . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants used for immunoprecipitation and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants used for bn _PROTEIN_ were described previously . the _PROTEIN_ strong allele was described previously by citation . the _PROTEIN_ mutant was obtained from the _PROTEIN_ and was described previously by citation and citation . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ knockout lines _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were obtained from the signal tdna _PROTEIN_ collection as insertion lines and respectively and the _PROTEIN_ insertion line was from the syngenta arabidopsis insertion lines described previously by citation in the columbia background . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were generated by crossing _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ respectively _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was generated by crossing _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ . in each case plants were allowed to self fertilize and candidate double plants were genotyped phenotypically and by pcr . the full length _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusion constructs were described previously . flim was performed using a bio rad radiance _PROTEIN_ system in combination with a nikon te inverted microscope as described . from the intensity images obtained complete _METHOD_ lifetime decays were calculated per pixel and fitted using a double exponential decay model . the _METHOD_ lifetime of one component was fixed to the value found for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . to prepare total protein extracts plant material was ground in liquid nitrogen and thawed in extraction buffer containing mm tris ph mm nacl triton x and a protease inhibitor cocktail according to the manufacturer 's instructions . samples were incubated on ice for min . the suspension was centrifuged at at for min . the concentration of extracted proteins was determined with the bio rad protein assay . after boiling of total protein for min in sample buffer containing mm tris hcl ph _PROTEIN_ bromphenol blue glycerol and mm dtt the proteins were separated on or _PROTEIN_ polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose by wet electroblotting . proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti _METHOD_ and a polyclonal antibody was generated against the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ kinase domain fusion protein . anti _PROTEIN_ specific antibodies were kindly provided by joanne _PROTEIN_ anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies were kindly provided by sebastian bednarek and antibodies have been described previously . bound primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase conjugated igg purified donkey anti rabbit secondary antibody at dilution or goat anti _PROTEIN_ secondary antibody at dilution and visualized using reagents for chemiluminescent detection . preparation of microsomes and bn _PROTEIN_ were performed as described . microsomes from d old seedlings from wild type plants or transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct were solubilized in extraction buffer supplemented with mm aminocaproic acid and incubated for min on ice . aliquots of supernatants were incubated with _METHOD_ brilliant blue g and glycerol and loaded on the gel . bn _PROTEIN_ was then performed according to citation on a to gradient polyacrylamide gel . albumin bovine monomer albumin bovine dimer urease trimer and urease hexamer from sigma aldrich were used as marker proteins . routinely we used four plates with d old seedlings to prepare a protein extract suitable for immunoprecipitation . ten milliliters of total plant protein extract in extraction buffer was incubated for h at with of protein a sepharose cl beads slurry in mm tris and mm nacl ph . after centrifugation at for min at the supernatant was incubated with of anti _METHOD_ anti _PROTEIN_ anti anti _PROTEIN_ or rabbit preimmune serum . after incubation with gentle mixing for h at of fresh slurry of protein a beads was added and incubation was continued for h. protein a beads were pelleted by centrifugation at for min and the supernatant was removed . the beads were washed three times with ml of wash buffer and once with mm ph . before the last wash step the beads together with the wash buffer were moved to a new tube . after centrifugation the wash buffer was removed and the beads were used in this form directly for digestion with trypsin and subsequent maldi _METHOD_ analysis . for immunodetection the proteins were eluted from the beads by adding _PROTEIN_ sample buffer and boiling for min at . in the case of coimmunoprecipitation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with rabbit anti _METHOD_ antibodies and detection with rabbit anti antibodies no dtt was included in the _PROTEIN_ sample buffer . this prevents separation of the heavy and light chains of the antibodies and improves the resolution of the blots because the detection system also recognized iggs whose light chains overlap with the proteins . proteins bound to protein a beads in of mm were incubated with ng of trypsin . after overnight incubation with gentle shaking at room temperature the ph was _PROTEIN_ to by adding trifluoroacetic acid in water up to . fifty microliters of peptide sample was injected into a mm prontosil column and eluted at a flow rate of with acetonitrile in water containing tfa . a gradient from to acetonitrile in water containing tfa was applied in s followed by a slower linear increase to acetonitrile in water containing tfa in another min . samples were collected directly onto a sample plate in fractions of s taking into account the system gradient delay time and column volume before starting collection . after air drying of a diluted cyano hydroxy cinnamic acid solution was added to each spot . this solution was prepared by diluting a saturated cyano hydroxy cinnamic acid solution times into the same solution . sample spots were recrystallized by applying of ethanol acetone water and tfa to all samples and allowing them to air dry . _METHOD_ spectra were measured with a bruker ultraflex maldi _METHOD_ apparatus equipped with a reflectron in positive mode with a high precision method . spectra were measured after external quadratic calibration with a peptide standard mixture containing nine peptides in the _METHOD_ range between and d . in general spectra were summed for to laser pulses and internally recalibrated with protein a derived peptides and/or trypsin autolysis peaks when present . all m/z values also present in the control peptide sample were subsequently removed from the m/z list obtained for the immunoprecipitated _PROTEIN_ protein complex . remaining m/z values were checked for sodium and/or potassium adducts . when found these m/z values were deleted as well . for identification of _PROTEIN_ the program gpmaw was used to determine which m/z values corresponded to tryptic peptides from the predicted protein sequence of _PROTEIN_ . these selected m/z values were used as inputs for the mascot program to search either the arabidopsis database or all entries without selecting a taxonomy . the posttranslational modifications phosphorylation and oxidation of met were allowed and a peptide m/z tolerance of ppm was used . after identification the m/z values that matched the _PROTEIN_ protein were removed from the list before searching for other proteins . alternatively the searches were performed with the complete m/z list directly using the mascot search engine . sequence data and seed stocks from this article can be found in the genbank/embl data libraries under the following accession numbers _PROTEIN_ cdna clone _PROTEIN_ cdna clone and _PROTEIN_ cdna clone . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ insertion lines were obtained from
