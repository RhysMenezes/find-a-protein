to study cellular morphogenesis genetically we isolated loss of function mutants of arabidopsis thaliana designated _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ mutations cause local outgrowth in the middle of epidermal cells of the hypocotyls and petioles resulting in the formation of a protuberance . in arabidopsis the hypocotyl epidermis differentiates into two alternate cell files the stoma cell file and the non stoma cell file by a mechanism involving transparent _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the ectopic protuberances of the _PROTEIN_ mutants were preferentially induced in the non stoma cell files which _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ dependent epidermal patterning is required for protuberance formation in _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ functions downstream from epidermal cell specification . pharmacological and genetic analyses demonstrated that ethylene promotes protuberance formation in _PROTEIN_ implying that _PROTEIN_ acts antagonistically to ethylene to suppress radial outgrowth . _PROTEIN_ is identical to _PROTEIN_ which encodes a never in mitosis a related protein kinase with sequence similarity to neks involved in microtubule organization in fungi algae and animals . the _PROTEIN_ mutation in which a conserved glu residue in the activation loop is substituted by arg completely abolishes its kinase activity . the intracellular localization of _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ showed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ accumulates in cytoplasmic spots associated with cortical microtubules and with a putative component of the tubulin complex . the localization of _PROTEIN_ is regulated by the c terminal domain which is truncated in the _PROTEIN_ allele . these results suggest that the role of _PROTEIN_ in the control of cellular morphogenesis is dependent on its kinase action and association with the cortical microtubules .
the epidermal cells of the hypocotyls of wild type arabidopsis seedlings elongate simply and do not show outward growth . a series of novel mutants were originally isolated on the basis of protuberances on the surfaces of their hypocotyls resulting from the unusual outward growth of the epidermal cells . these mutants were referred to as ibo meaning small protuberances in japanese . three recessive alleles of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were identified and characterized . the _PROTEIN_ mutant was isolated from ethyl methane sulfonate _METHOD_ mutagenized populations of the wassilewskija accession . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants were identified from _METHOD_ mutagenized populations of the columbia accession . we also identified _PROTEIN_ from t dna insertion populations as described in a _PROTEIN_ section . because all _PROTEIN_ alleles were very similar in the protuberance phenotype the _PROTEIN_ mutant was _PROTEIN_ characterized in detail . in the _PROTEIN_ seedlings the epidermal protuberances were observed not only on the hypocotyls but also on the petioles of cotyledons and rosette leaves . each protuberance was a single cell structure with a round tip similar in appearance to a root hair . each of the protruding epidermal cells formed only one protuberance in the middle of the cell . the protuberances became visible days after germination which corresponds to the linear growth phase of hypocotyls . in arabidopsis hypocotyls two kinds of epidermal cell files are arranged alternately into the non stoma cell file and the stoma cell file . we examined the relationship between these cell files and the protuberances in _PROTEIN_ . close observation of the hypocotyl surface of the _PROTEIN_ mutant indicated that the protuberances are mostly restricted to the non stoma cell files suggesting that the formation of protuberances is dependent on epidermal patterning . next we characterized the effects of the _PROTEIN_ mutations on the trichomes and root hairs . whereas the number of trichomes per leaf was not affected by any _PROTEIN_ mutations trichome branching was increased in _PROTEIN_ . with respect to root hair density there was no difference between the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ mutants . however with _PROTEIN_ to root hair length _PROTEIN_ was slightly shorter and _PROTEIN_ was rather longer than the wild type . to characterize the _PROTEIN_ phenotype in more detail we analyzed the cell specific _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . a _PROTEIN_ reporter gene was fused to the promoter region of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ and these constructs were introduced into the wild type and _PROTEIN_ . the gus activity of the _PROTEIN_ gus lines was localized to the non stoma cell files in the hypocotyls the atrichoblast cell files in the roots and the trichomes in the leaves . the gus activity of the gus lines was specific to the root hair cells . these patterns of reporter gene _PROTEIN_ are consistent with the results of previous studies . the _PROTEIN_ mutation did not affect the _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ gus or gus . it is noteworthy that the epidermal cells undergoing protuberance formation in _PROTEIN_ showed strong gus activity in the _PROTEIN_ gus lines and no gus activity in the gus lines . these results indicate that the protuberances are induced in the non stoma cell files _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and also suggest that the protuberance forming cells are similar in gene _PROTEIN_ to trichome cells rather than to root hair cells . to test any possible genetic interactions of _PROTEIN_ with the epidermal regulators _PROTEIN_ and caprice _PROTEIN_ double mutant lines were generated and characterized for the hypocotyl phenotype . _PROTEIN_ is required for the promotion of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which was prevented by _PROTEIN_ . in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant the protuberances were strongly suppressed indicating that _PROTEIN_ dependent epidermal patterning is required for the formation of protuberances in _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ cpc double mutant formed protuberances like those of the _PROTEIN_ single mutant . with respect to the trichome and root hair phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ and cpc the _PROTEIN_ mutations had neither an enhancing nor a suppressing effect . like the _PROTEIN_ single mutant the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant exhibited severe defects in trichome development and ectopic root hair formation in the normally atrichoblast cell files . like the cpc single mutant root hairs were very few in the _PROTEIN_ cpc double mutant . the double mutant analyses demonstrated that protuberance formation in _PROTEIN_ involves _PROTEIN_ an important regulator required for trichome differentiation but not _PROTEIN_ a positive regulator of root hair differentiation . this finding together with the results for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ suggests that the _PROTEIN_ protuberances might be trichome like structures . ethylene is well known to have a function of controlling the radial growth of plant cells and it has been shown that ethylene promotes root hair formation and elongation in arabidopsis . therefore we examined the effects of the ethylene precursor amino cyclopropane _PROTEIN_ acid and the ethylene biosynthesis inhibitor aminoethoxyvinylglycine on protuberance formation in _PROTEIN_ . when _PROTEIN_ seedlings were grown on germination medium supplemented with acc the number of protuberances was markedly increased . in contrast _PROTEIN_ seedlings cultured on gm containing avg had far fewer protuberances than the untreated _PROTEIN_ seedlings . the reduction of protuberances by avg was counteracted by the simultaneous addition of acc suggesting that avg and acc affect protuberance formation via changes in ethylene biosynthesis . no protuberances were induced in the epidermal cells of the wild type hypocotyls by any treatment tested . the effects of genetic modification of ethylene signaling on protuberance formation in _PROTEIN_ were examined with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants . as shown in figure the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant showed significantly increased protuberances on the hypocotyl epidermis suggesting that the constitutive activation of ethylene signaling by the _PROTEIN_ mutation enhanced protuberance formation in _PROTEIN_ . in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant the number of protuberances was fewer than in the _PROTEIN_ single mutant suggesting a role for _PROTEIN_ dependent ethylene signaling in protuberance formation . together these results indicate the involvement of ethylene in protuberance formation in _PROTEIN_ . to test the possible relationship between _PROTEIN_ protuberance formation and cell elongation we examined the effects of dark induced etiolation and gibberellic acid treatment . when hypocotyl elongation was stimulated by etiolation or gibberellic acid the _PROTEIN_ seedlings formed very few protuberances on their hypocotyls . this result indicates that the promotion of cell elongation antagonizes protuberance formation in _PROTEIN_ . to determine the molecular basis of the _PROTEIN_ phenotype we identified the _PROTEIN_ gene by map based cloning . the _PROTEIN_ gene was localized between markers and on chromosome . by determining the nucleotide sequences of the candidate genes in this region we found mutations in one gene _GENE_ in all _PROTEIN_ alleles . introduction of two genomic fragments encompassing _GENE_ into _PROTEIN_ recovered the normal phenotype . a t dna insertion mutant of _PROTEIN_ was identified in the collection of salk t dna insertion lines and was designated _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ mutant exhibited protuberances on its hypocotyls like the other _PROTEIN_ mutants described above . these results indicate that _GENE_ is the _PROTEIN_ gene . because _GENE_ was designated _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ in previous reports _PROTEIN_ will be referred to as _PROTEIN_ hereafter . _PROTEIN_ is deduced to encode a protein of amino acids with a relative molecular _METHOD_ of and an isoelectric point of . sequence analysis of _PROTEIN_ identified a ser/thr protein kinase domain at the n terminus which has significant homology to the kinase domains of the nima related kinases of various _METHOD_ including fungi animals and plants . in _PROTEIN_ the kinase domain is followed by a long tail containing three pest degradation motifs and a coiled coil domain near the c terminus . the _PROTEIN_ mutant allele has a g to a transition at nucleotide position which causes an amino acid substitution of _PROTEIN_ with arg in the activation loop of the kinase domain . the _PROTEIN_ allele has a c to t transition at nucleotide position which alters the codon to a stop codon and might result in the production of a truncated _PROTEIN_ protein without the c terminal half which contains the coiled coil domain . the _PROTEIN_ allele has a c to t transition at nucleotide position which replaces with thr in the c terminal region . careful comparison with the amino acid sequences of plant neks found a conserved sequence at the c terminus following the coiled coil domain which we designated the plant nek c terminal motif . the pro residue altered by the _PROTEIN_ mutation is highly conserved in this motif . reverse transcription pcr analysis detected the _PROTEIN_ transcripts in all the organs examined especially in roots inflorescence _METHOD_ and flowers . the accumulation of the _PROTEIN_ transcripts was not significantly altered in _PROTEIN_ but was slightly reduced in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . to investigate the protein kinase activity of _PROTEIN_ a recombinant protein glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in which full length _PROTEIN_ was fused at its n terminus to _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli purified with glutathione beads and assayed for in vitro kinase activity . after electrophoresis of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ that had been incubated with _PROTEIN_ a radioactive band was detected at the position of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ indicating autophosphorylation activity of _PROTEIN_ . when _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was incubated with myelin basic protein an intense signal corresponding to the mbp band was detected indicating transphosphorylation activity of _PROTEIN_ on mbp . a requirement of _PROTEIN_ kinase activity for divalent cations was determined for both the autophosphorylation and the phosphorylation of mbp . the addition of and to the reaction mixture produced strong and weak phosphorylation activities respectively . no phosphorylation activity was detected with or in the absence of cations . the phosphorylation activity of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ incubated in buffer containing both and was slightly lower than that in buffer containing only . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ requires or but not and prefers to . the _PROTEIN_ allele has an arg substitution at _PROTEIN_ which occurs at the c terminal end of the activation loop and is conserved in various kinase families including the nek family . the autophosphorylation of the ser/thr residues in the activation loop of the nek proteins is required for full kinase activity . to examine whether the _PROTEIN_ mutation results in either the loss or reduction of the kinase activity of _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ mutation was introduced into _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we also generated two kinase dead negative controls and three mutant proteins with single mutations at the putative phosphorylation sites of the activation loop . the wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and mutated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ proteins were subjected to a kinase assay . the _PROTEIN_ mutation and the kinase dead mutations resulted in a total loss of kinase activity . the mutation reduced the kinase activity . the mutations and greatly reduced the phosphorylation activity to the basal level suggesting that these ser/thr residues are essential for the activation of _PROTEIN_ by autophosphorylation . to investigate the intracellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fused at the n terminus to _METHOD_ was transiently _PROTEIN_ in leaves of nicotiana benthamiana . strong _METHOD_ was observed in small dots aligned along the cortical filamentous structures . some of the strongly _METHOD_ dots were localized at the branching points of the filamentous structures . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ pattern suggests that _PROTEIN_ is associated with cortical microtubules . to test this possibility leaves were treated with the microtubule stabilizing drug taxol or the microtubule depolymerizing drug oryzalin . treatment with taxol intensified the _METHOD_ labeling of the filamentous structures . in the presence of oryzalin the filamentous structures disappeared whereas the cortical _METHOD_ dots remained . however treatment with an actin microfilament depolymerizing drug latrunculin b did not significantly affect the localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . when the cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were immunolabeled for microtubules the _METHOD_ dots and filaments of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were observed along with the cortical microtubules . all these results showed that _PROTEIN_ is localized in association with the cortical microtubules . to further characterize the small dots labeled with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ a putative ortholog of _PROTEIN_ a component of the tubulin complex was co _PROTEIN_ in a monomeric red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fused form _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ dots at the branching points of the microtubules were localized in close proximity to the dots labeled with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ suggesting some relationships of _PROTEIN_ with the _PROTEIN_ containing tubulin complex . we also analyzed the subcellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ proteins . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ contain the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations respectively . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labeled cytoplasmic spots associated with the cortical filaments as did the wild type _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ whereas _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localized preferentially to the _LOCATION_ . these results imply that the c terminal region containing the coiled coil domain which is truncated by the _PROTEIN_ mutation is required for the association of _PROTEIN_ with microtubules . to evaluate the roles of _PROTEIN_ in the regulation of microtubules the orientation of cortical microtubules in the hypocotyl epidermis was examined by confocal _METHOD_ microscopy . the majority of the cortical microtubules were arrayed transversely to the long axis of cells in the wild type . in _PROTEIN_ the orientation angles of microtubules centered around but were slightly more deviated than the wild type . in statistical analysis using the kolmogorov smirnov test however no significant difference was detected between the wild type and _PROTEIN_ .
to isolate the _PROTEIN_ mutants the wild type ws and col seeds were treated with solution of _METHOD_ for h at room temperature . approximately seedlings were screened for protuberances on the hypocotyl epidermis . the _PROTEIN_ gus line and cpc are described in wada et al . respectively . the gus line was kindly provided by dr takashi aoyama . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seeds were provided from the arabidopsis biological resource center _PROTEIN_ . the seeds and information about _PROTEIN_ were obtained from the signal website and _PROTEIN_ . for growth of seedlings surface sterilized seeds were plated on germination medium . after days at plates were incubated at in continuous light . mapping was carried out by dna analysis with simple sequence length polymorphism and cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence markers . genomic clones and were isolated from the transformation competent genomic library and used for complementation analysis . arabidopsis plants were transformed by the floral dip method . total rna was extracted as described previously . after treatment with rnase free dnase i first strand cdna was synthesized with superscript iii according to the manufacturer s instructions and was used as a template for pcr with gene specific primer sets for cycles _PROTEIN_ cycles _PROTEIN_ cycles . samples of gus lines were stained as described . the dna fragment containing the full length open reading frame for _PROTEIN_ was cloned into a binary vector of that provides a n terminal _METHOD_ fusion protein driven by the promoter . the _PROTEIN_ orf fragment was cloned into a binary vector that provides a c terminal _METHOD_ fusion protein driven by the promoter . transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in leaves of n. benthamiana was performed by agroinfiltration . indirect _METHOD_ staining was performed to visualize microtubules according to citation and citation . rat monoclonal anti tubulin antibody was used as a first antibody at the dilution of . alexa anti rat igg antibody or fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated anti rat igg antibody was used as a secondary antibody at a dilution of . quantitative analysis of microtubule orientation was done as described by citation . arabidopsis plants were observed using a stereoscopic microscope _METHOD_ _METHOD_ equipped with _PROTEIN_ ccd camera . a equipped with _PROTEIN_ was used for the light microscopy and _METHOD_ microscopy . an _PROTEIN_ was used for the confocal laser scanning microscopy . scanning electron microscopy was performed according to citation with a jsm . the cdna encoding the full length _PROTEIN_ was cloned into the _PROTEIN_ fusion vector . the point mutations were introduced by the kod plus mutagenesis kit . one microgram of the _PROTEIN_ tagged recombinant proteins was incubated with or without mbp in of kinase buffer containing _PROTEIN_ at for min . reaction products were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and detected by autoradiography . the detailed experimental procedure is available in appendix .
