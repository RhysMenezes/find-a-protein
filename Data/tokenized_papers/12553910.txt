exchange _PROTEIN_ for arf _PROTEIN_ regulate vesicle trafficking in a variety of _METHOD_ . the arabidopsis protein _PROTEIN_ is a brefeldin a sensitive arf gef that is required for the proper _PROTEIN_ localization of _PROTEIN_ a candidate transporter of the plant hormone auxin . mutations in _PROTEIN_ lead to developmental defects that resemble those caused by interfering with auxin transport . both _PROTEIN_ localization and auxin transport are also sensitive to bfa . in this paper we show that _PROTEIN_ localizes to endosomes and is required for their structural integrity . we engineered a bfa resistant version of _PROTEIN_ . in plants harboring this fully functional _PROTEIN_ variant _PROTEIN_ localization and auxin transport are no longer sensitive to bfa while trafficking of other proteins is still affected by the drug . our results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is required for the recycling of auxin transport components and suggest that arf gefs regulate specific endosomal trafficking pathways .
brefeldin a inhibits activation of arf proteins by binding to an arf gdp/arf gef complex citation . naturally occurring bfa resistant or bfa sensitive arf gef variants differ in a number of amino acid residues consistently conserved in the exchange domain . some of these residues were shown to be critical for bfa resistance of yeast and mammalian arf gefs citation . exchanging those residues renders bfa resistant arf gefs sensitive and vice versa both in biochemical assays and in vivo citation . we reasoned that if the bfa sensitive _PROTEIN_ arf gef of arabidopsis was also rendered bfa resistant by introducing homologous amino acid exchanges into its catalytic domain we could determine which bfa sensitive trafficking pathways are specifically regulated by _PROTEIN_ . a kb genomic fragment of the _PROTEIN_ gene containing kb upstream of the _PROTEIN_ and about kb downstream of the stop codon complemented the gnom mutant phenotype . this fragment was used to insert coding sequences for a myc tag or _METHOD_ at the end of the open reading frame citation . a bfa resistant variant was derived from the myc tagged construct by introducing an m to l mutation at amino acid position in the domain citation . we chose this mutation amongst a number of possible ones because it was shown to confer good albeit not complete bfa resistance to yeast _PROTEIN_ without affecting its ability to complement the _PROTEIN_ knockout citation . furthermore the closest homolog of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ like _PROTEIN_ carries l instead of m at this position citation suggesting that an m to l mutation will not interfere with the exchange activity of plant arf gefs . the three constructs _PROTEIN_ myc _PROTEIN_ wt myc and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were transformed into segregating populations of gnom heterozygous arabidopsis plants . for each construct gnom mutant plants from several independent lines were shown to be rescued . thus _PROTEIN_ myc _PROTEIN_ wt myc and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins appeared to be fully functional variants of the _PROTEIN_ protein . root tips of _PROTEIN_ wt myc seedlings displayed _PROTEIN_ localization of _PROTEIN_ which strongly accumulated in internal compartments upon bfa treatment for min citation as previously described for wild type citation . by contrast root tips of _PROTEIN_ myc seedlings showed nearly complete resistance to bfa induced intracellular accumulation with no or only very few intracellular patches visible after min citation . immunolocalization of untreated _PROTEIN_ wt myc seedlings with monoclonal myc antibody revealed strong _LOCATION_ background staining and a number of small intracellular patches citation . upon bfa treatment _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ wt myc signal was _PROTEIN_ with a concomitant strong increase in apparent _LOCATION_ signal that coalesced into large perinuclear aggregates citation . these observations were consistent with earlier differential centrifugation experiments of cell extracts which gave a predominantly _LOCATION_ and a minor _LOCATION_ bound form of _PROTEIN_ with the latter increasing upon bfa treatment citation . we sometimes also observed a weak _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ label appearing upon bfa treatment which was not observed in untreated tissue citation . neither the increase in _LOCATION_ label nor aggregation into patches was seen for the _PROTEIN_ myc protein illustrating its bfa resistance citation . in untreated roots of _PROTEIN_ wt myc seedlings no colocalization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was observed citation . however double labeling of _PROTEIN_ wt myc after bfa treatment revealed a complete colocalization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in perinuclear aggregates citation previously described as bfa compartments citation . double labeling of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ myc lines after bfa treatment revealed no colocalization of the two proteins with _PROTEIN_ remaining _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ staying at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ citation . the bfa insensitivity of _PROTEIN_ accumulation at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ myc lines together with the colocalization of _PROTEIN_ and bfa sensitive _PROTEIN_ to the same endomembranes after bfa treatment strongly suggests that _PROTEIN_ arf gef is responsible for recycling _PROTEIN_ through an intracellular compartment . to identify the intracellular site of _PROTEIN_ action we performed double labeling experiments of _PROTEIN_ with available markers for endomembrane compartments . although a number of specific antibodies are available for plants very few have been shown to function in confocal microscopy imaging of arabidopsis seedling root tips . the _PROTEIN_ antiserum detects an _LOCATION_ resident transmembrane protein citation . this antiserum labeled _LOCATION_ compartments resembling previous descriptions of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ citation . _PROTEIN_ wt myc did not colocalize with _PROTEIN_ citation . upon bfa treatment the _LOCATION_ network appeared unchanged and the _PROTEIN_ signal did not colocalize with the _PROTEIN_ labeled patches citation . thus _PROTEIN_ positive _LOCATION_ were different from the _LOCATION_ network . arf _PROTEIN_ recruit _PROTEIN_ coats as well as clathrin coats to _LOCATION_ for vesicle budding . whereas _PROTEIN_ coats mediate intra _LOCATION_ transport and recycling to the _LOCATION_ clathrin coats have been implicated in the formation of endocytic vesicles and vesicle budding from the trans _LOCATION_ network . an early observation _PROTEIN_ bfa action was the inhibition of _PROTEIN_ recruitment to _LOCATION_ citation . a similar effect on the _PROTEIN_ subunit has recently been described in tobacco by cells citation . we reasoned that if _PROTEIN_ were involved in the recruitment of _PROTEIN_ coats and _PROTEIN_ should colocalize and _PROTEIN_ localization should become bfa resistant in _PROTEIN_ myc roots . in untreated cells _PROTEIN_ appeared to be associated with _LOCATION_ stacks as judged from the number size and characteristic shape of the signal citation which is consistent with previous descriptions of _PROTEIN_ label in tobacco citation . however upon bfa treatment the reported abolishment of _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ association was not observed in our system . instead _PROTEIN_ stayed at the _LOCATION_ but the individual _LOCATION_ stacks aggregated into larger clusters without completely losing their integrity citation . such discrepancies have previously been reported between different mammalian cell lines citation . _PROTEIN_ wt myc did not appear to colocalize with _PROTEIN_ in untreated cells citation . upon bfa treatment _PROTEIN_ labeled clusters surrounded a _PROTEIN_ positive central patch without showing any obvious colocalization citation . in bfa resistant _PROTEIN_ lines _PROTEIN_ label still aggregated to enclose a core which however was _PROTEIN_ negative citation . thus _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ did not colocalize nor did _PROTEIN_ compartments become resistant in bfa resistant _PROTEIN_ lines . we conclude that _PROTEIN_ does not regulate budding of _LOCATION_ associated _PROTEIN_ coated vesicles . the trans _LOCATION_ network can be viewed as the station of the secretory pathway at which _PROTEIN_ dependent _LOCATION_ trafficking is taken over by non _PROTEIN_ coats such as clathrin citation . antibodies raised against tgn localized _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ citation showed strong staining of elongated often sickle shaped structures citation that appeared to be different from structures labeled with _LOCATION_ stack markers citation . again no colocalization was observed between and _PROTEIN_ wt myc citation . in contrast to _PROTEIN_ label did not change upon treatment with bfa even when high doses were applied for prolonged time periods and _PROTEIN_ wt myc did not colocalize with citation . we conclude that _PROTEIN_ positive endomembranes are also different from the tgn and that _PROTEIN_ probably does not act along the secretory pathway . the _METHOD_ styryl dye is used as an endocytic tracer in yeast and mammalian cells . it fluoresces upon insertion into the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and is taken up by the cell exclusively through _LOCATION_ trafficking in yeast citation . this eventually leads to labeling of all the compartments along the endocytic pathway down to the _LOCATION_ . recently there have been a number of reports about the use of fm dyes as endocytic markers in plants citation . because can only be used for labeling of live cells we performed double labeling with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ citation . although weak _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labeling of live cells resembled _PROTEIN_ myc _METHOD_ labeling of fixed cells . upon uptake of for min _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ appeared to be closely associated and partially overlapping with the dye labeled compartments citation . in the presence of bfa accumulated in larger patches and in this case _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ completely colocalized with the label to those patches citation . at this time point _LOCATION_ were not yet labeled by . these data strongly suggest that _PROTEIN_ acts at an endosomal compartment that partially overlaps with but is not entirely identical to the labeled compartment . if _PROTEIN_ acts at an endosomal compartment gnom mutant cells might show some abnormality in endosomal structure or function . to test this idea gnom mutant cell cultures were established and transfected with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs for transient _PROTEIN_ . by sequence similarity _PROTEIN_ is a member of the family of endosomal rab _PROTEIN_ citation . _PROTEIN_ was shown to localize to structures very similar to _PROTEIN_ positive compartments and to also colocalize with compartments of early accumulation . upon transient _PROTEIN_ in cultured cells _PROTEIN_ positive compartments appeared as larger patches in gnom than in wild type cells citation . in addition _PROTEIN_ compartments were often _PROTEIN_ shaped which was only rarely observed in wild type cells . similar alterations of _PROTEIN_ compartments were observed when treating wild type cell cultures with bfa . these observations support the subcellular localization data and strongly suggest that _PROTEIN_ arf gef plays a role in regulating endosome structure and function . bfa has been shown to induce intracellular accumulation of _PROTEIN_ and to alter the distribution of other _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized proteins including _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ atsnap pm _PROTEIN_ the auxin influx carrier _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ homolog _PROTEIN_ or even cell wall components such as pectins citation . to examine whether _PROTEIN_ is specifically involved in _PROTEIN_ trafficking we analyzed the effects of bfa treatment on the localization of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ homolog _PROTEIN_ in our lines . the cytokinesis specific _PROTEIN_ syntaxin localizes to intracellular patches and the newly forming cell plate destined to become a new _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ citation . upon bfa treatment _PROTEIN_ coalesced into large patches similar to the described bfa compartments . bfa induced accumulation was also observed for pm _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ colocalized with all three proteins upon bfa treatment . however in the _PROTEIN_ myc line _PROTEIN_ aggregation into large patches still occurred citation suggesting that _PROTEIN_ trafficking in cytokinetic cells is dependent on other bfa sensitive gefs . for pm _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ localization the situation was more complex . first of all not all pm _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ labeled cells responded to bfa and the variability between individual roots was higher than in the case of _PROTEIN_ . this might be due to differences in recycling rates or transport routes used between individual cells and roots . when comparing effects of bfa in _PROTEIN_ myc lines a similar variability was observed ranging from almost complete to very weak increases in resistance compared to _PROTEIN_ wt myc lines . in order to determine if there is a significant partial resistance despite strong variability we counted several thousand cells from z axis scans of a number of root tips . this revealed a partial bfa resistance of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in bfa resistant lines citation . thus _PROTEIN_ action does not mediate trafficking of all _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins to the same extent . the observation that cycling of _PROTEIN_ proteins became bfa resistant in _PROTEIN_ myc lines led us to investigate if this would be reflected in bfa insensitivity of _PROTEIN_ auxin transport . reliable measurements of _PROTEIN_ transport in arabidopsis can be done on inflorescence _METHOD_ . exposing the upper end of inflorescence _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ wt myc lines to a pulse of radioactively labeled auxin led to a peak of radioactive auxin at a distance of about mm after min of transport . upon concomitant bfa treatment this peak was nearly abolished . by contrast _PROTEIN_ myc lines showed no difference of auxin peak intensity with or without bfa treatment . thus bfa resistant _PROTEIN_ confers bfa resistance of both _PROTEIN_ cycling and _PROTEIN_ auxin transport activity in planta . high concentrations of bfa lead to growth arrest of cells probably due to the severe block of intracellular trafficking which inhibits fundamental processes such as cell plate expansion during cytokinesis citation . in contrast low concentrations of bfa have surprisingly specific effects on auxin transport related processes such as root hair cell _PROTEIN_ gravitropism or initiation of _PROTEIN_ root primordia citation . we tested whether _PROTEIN_ is the arf gef responsible for the inhibition of these processes by bfa . we exposed seedlings to a change in gravity vector and recorded their realignment after hr . treatment with bfa strongly interfered with the gravitropic response of _PROTEIN_ wt myc lines citation . _PROTEIN_ myc seedlings in contrast showed absolutely no difference in their gravitropic response in the absence or presence of bfa citation . the same was true for _PROTEIN_ root formation . treatment with bfa led to complete inhibition of _PROTEIN_ root initiation in bfa sensitive lines whereas resistant lines showed no _PROTEIN_ in the number of _PROTEIN_ roots formed citation . additionally this concentration of bfa significantly reduced primary root elongation which was also less affected in bfa resistant _PROTEIN_ lines citation . thus the sole alteration of _PROTEIN_ arf gef rendered auxin related developmental processes insensitive to inhibition by low concentrations of bfa .
plants on soil or plates were grown in growth chambers under long day conditions at . an avr ii site was introduced at the end of the _PROTEIN_ orf in the _PROTEIN_ cdna vector citation by primer extension pcr citation . a myc tag or _METHOD_ tag was synthesized by oligonucleotide hybridization or pcr from _METHOD_ vector and inserted into this site . a bpu pac i fragment encompassing the myc tag or _METHOD_ tag was then transferred into the complementing _PROTEIN_ genomic fragment in pbluescript . the resulting pblue _PROTEIN_ xba i myc was further modified by introducing a fragment containing the mutagenised domain encoding region . site directed mutagenesis of the domain was done in through primer extension pcr introducing an _PROTEIN_ to ctg change into the _PROTEIN_ orf and the mutated region was transferred to pblue _PROTEIN_ xba i myc as an _METHOD_ i bpu fragment . all pcr derived fragments were sequenced . the resulting _PROTEIN_ myc _PROTEIN_ wt myc and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ genomic fragments were then transferred as xba i restricted fragments into pbar a and transformed into plants of a gnom heterozygous population _PROTEIN_ . complementation analysis was done by pcr screening of plants using a ler/col polymorphism in the _PROTEIN_ coding region citation . mutant complementation by the constructs was then confirmed by segregation analysis of seedling phenotypes of homozygous and heterozygous gnom mutant lines in the . in order to exclude effects in transgenic plants that are not linked to the introduced _PROTEIN_ locus itself but to differences in the lines or the genetic background of the hybrids used for transformation we always compared independent bfa resistant transgenic lines to independent sensitive ones . _METHOD_ preparations and confocal microscopy were done as described citation . antibodies and dilutions used were anti _PROTEIN_ and anti _PROTEIN_ both kindly provided by k. palme anti _PROTEIN_ anti myc anti anti _PROTEIN_ and anti kindly provided by d.g . robinson and anti pm _PROTEIN_ kindly provided by w. michalke . bfa incubation of seedlings for _METHOD_ labeling was done in cell culture dishes containing ml basal medium _METHOD_ and the indicated concentration of bfa . control treatments contained equal amounts of bfa solvent _METHOD_ . bfa treatments for growth assays were done by transferring seedlings germinated on bm plates onto bfa containing plates . bfa plates were stored at for no longer than days before use . transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts of cultured cells were done as described citation except that suspension cultured cells were incubated in enzyme solution for hr at and then passed through the nylon mesh twice . _PROTEIN_ auxin transport was measured in inflorescence axes of transgenic arabidopsis plants as described citation with the following modifications . a concentration of iaa were used for all incubations . bfa treatment was done by immersion for min in a solution containing iaa and either bfa or the same volume of _METHOD_ . the specific activity of iaa used was tbq mole . gravitropic growth was assessed by marking the gravity vector on plates . pictures of plates were taken and angles measured from digital images with adobe illustrator . _PROTEIN_ root formation was assessed by inspecting the primary root under a binocular for _PROTEIN_ root primordia . in the case of absence of visible primordia chloral hydrate cleared preparations of roots were also inspected microscopically for absence of pericycle divisions indicative of early stages of _PROTEIN_ root development not visible in the binocular .
