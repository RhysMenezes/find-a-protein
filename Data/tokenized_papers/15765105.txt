formins are actin organizing proteins that are involved in cytokinesis and cell _PROTEIN_ . in the plant arabidopsis thaliana there are more than formin homologues all of which have unknown roles . in this study we characterize specific cellular and molecular functions of the arabidopsis formin _PROTEIN_ . despite the low identity of _PROTEIN_ to yeast and mammalian formins the _PROTEIN_ protein interacts with the barbed end of actin filaments and nucleates actin filament polymerization in vitro as is the case in yeast and mammals . in vivo the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein localizes to the cell plate a plant specific membranous component that is assembled at the plane of cell division . consistent with these data loss of function of _PROTEIN_ compromises cytokinesis in the seed endosperm . furthermore endogenous _PROTEIN_ transcripts accumulate in the posterior pole of the endosperm and loss of function of _PROTEIN_ perturbs proper morphogenesis of the endosperm posterior pole . although cytokinesis in animals yeast and plants occurs through morphologically distinct _METHOD_ our study finds that formin recruitment to sites of actin assembly is a common feature of cell division among eukaryotes .
formins are highly conserved proteins that are implicated in many actin requiring processes such as cytokinesis establishment of egg _PROTEIN_ and formation of stress fibres . in the enhancer trap _PROTEIN_ line the _PROTEIN_ pattern of which provides a _PROTEIN_ marker for endosperm development we have identified the corresponding t dna insertion that is localized in the upstream region of _PROTEIN_ and that belongs to the arabidopsis formin homology _PROTEIN_ family . the _PROTEIN_ domain of _PROTEIN_ shares identity with other eukaryote formins and retains many highly conserved residues . by contrast the amino terminus of _PROTEIN_ is highly divergent from non plant formins and shares the predicted domains that are typical of type i arabidopsis formins . in the homologous _PROTEIN_ this n terminal domain is required for localization to the cell _LOCATION_ . in yeasts actin patches depend on _PROTEIN_ complexes and cables of actin filaments depend on formins . the _PROTEIN_ domain can nucleate actin filaments that grow at their barbed ends in vitro and can control actin assembly in vivo . recent studies in arabidopsis showed that extensive actin filaments can be nucleated in the absence of _PROTEIN_ complexes indicating that a potential role may exist for formins in plants . to test whether _PROTEIN_ nucleates actin polymerization in vitro we purified two _PROTEIN_ terminal constructs of _PROTEIN_ fused to glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cter consists of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and c terminal domains and _PROTEIN_ cter consists of the _PROTEIN_ and c terminal domains . pyrene labelled actin monomers were incubated alone or in the presence of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cter and assembly was monitored by pyrene _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cter _PROTEIN_ the initial lag of the actin polymerization curve in a concentration dependent manner corresponding to active nucleation . elongation of actin filaments nucleated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cter with actin monomers bound to profilin _METHOD_ that these filaments are growing at their barbed ends . the concentration of new barbed ends is strongly dependent on the presence of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cter . the curve plateaus at a high concentration of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cter because elongation of actin filaments rapidly consumes actin monomers before each formin can form new filaments . this observation is in agreement with a previous report of actin nucleation by _PROTEIN_ complexes . filament length is inversely correlated to the concentration of nucleation centres . accordingly actin filaments are markedly shorter in the presence of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cter than alone . to initially ascertain barbed end dynamics in the presence of _PROTEIN_ a constant concentration of actin filaments was incubated with increasing concentrations of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cter before the addition of labelled actin monomers . the initial rate of elongation which is proportional to the number of available free actin filament barbed ends _PROTEIN_ as we increased the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cter concentration . this indicates that the barbed ends of preformed filaments were capped with high affinity by pre incubation with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cter . in addition pyrene labelled actin filaments were diluted below the barbed end critical concentration in the presence of increasing amounts of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cter . the initial rate of depolymerization _PROTEIN_ with increased _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cter concentration again in agreement with a barbed end capping activity . interestingly the _PROTEIN_ cter protein has no effect on actin nucleation . however _PROTEIN_ cter inhibits the actin nucleation that is driven by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cter indicating that _PROTEIN_ cter competes with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cter for binding actin monomers . the biochemical analysis of _PROTEIN_ indicates that the actin organizing activity of formins is conserved throughout eukaryotes . to determine if such nucleating activity could also be related to cytokinesis we examined _PROTEIN_ subcellular localization in roots in which _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in the wild type . _PROTEIN_ was tagged with green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ in transgenic arabidopsis plants . we used the constitutive camv promoter that enables dynamic observations in roots with enhanced optical resolution in comparison to that seen in endosperm . _METHOD_ microscopy showed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ accumulates in the cell plate of dividing root cells . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal follows the expanding plate over time and its intensity gradually reduces after contact is made between the cell plate and the parent cell wall . the dynamic localization of _PROTEIN_ protein to the cell plate indicates that _PROTEIN_ has a role in cytokinesis . a _METHOD_ dotted pattern of undetermined identity was also observed in the cytoplasm and might not reflect the true localization of _PROTEIN_ as potential artifacts may be associated with overexpression of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the endosperm in the arabidopsis plant seed provides a simple and tractable system for studying cytokinesis within a multinucleate single cell . endosperm development involves a series of successive _LOCATION_ divisions that are devoid of cytokinesis generating a syncytium . after eight rounds of division the syncytium contains approximately _LOCATION_ that become partitioned into mononucleate cells by a cytokinetic mechanism that is referred to as cellularization . cellularization initiates from the anterior pole where the embryo develops and continues towards peripheral endosperm ending at the posterior pole that remains syncytial . _LOCATION_ at this pole are included in large multinucleate structures called nodules that gradually migrate and eventually fuse with the cyst at the most posterior location . as the _METHOD_ activity in the _PROTEIN_ tagged _PROTEIN_ line indicated a role for this gene in endosperm development we examined the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pattern during seed development . _PROTEIN_ mrnas were localized in the endosperm by in situ hybridization on seed sections . a strong _PROTEIN_ was specific to the posterior pole in the cyst and in nodules on top of the cyst . no _PROTEIN_ was detectable in the anterior and peripheral endosperm or in other seed compartments . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was further confirmed in transgenic arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ reporter yellow _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the control of the _PROTEIN_ upstream region . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is first detected in the posterior endosperm early in development and remains restricted to the posterior pole throughout the syncytial phase . this pattern persists after endosperm cellularization . together these two experiments indicate that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is restricted to the posterior pole throughout endosperm development . however a _METHOD_ activity was also detected in the anterior and peripheral syncytial endosperm in the _PROTEIN_ line indicating that the enhancer activity detected by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ does not entirely mimic the endogenous _PROTEIN_ pattern . to gain insight into _PROTEIN_ function during endosperm development we examined two _PROTEIN_ insertional mutant lines . reverse transcription pcr _PROTEIN_ analyses with primers downstream of the insertions revealed no _PROTEIN_ transcripts . a barely detectable level of _PROTEIN_ transcripts was obtained with primers that were positioned upstream of the insertions . these _PROTEIN_ mutations probably result in loss of function as neither of the two mutants _PROTEIN_ the actin organizing domains of _PROTEIN_ . although _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in most tissues we could not detect any phenotypes in vegetative organs probably due to the redundant function with other formins . microscopic examination of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seeds revealed perturbation of endosperm cellularization . cleared siliques were used to score the onset of cellularization in wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant lines . whereas most wild type endosperm is cellularized by the heart embryo stage cellularization was delayed at that embryo stage in _PROTEIN_ endosperm . nevertheless cellularization occurred in the endosperm of both mutant alleles _PROTEIN_ during the _PROTEIN_ heart embryo stage when wild type endosperm is completely cellularized . to ascertain the origin of the delay of cellularization in _PROTEIN_ endosperm we compared the onset of cellularization between wild type and _PROTEIN_ endosperm . in the wild type endosperm cellularization occurs after _LOCATION_ division and is initially marked by a cell plate between separating sister _LOCATION_ . this is rarely seen in fixed tissue as complete cellularization is rapidly achieved by the formation of cell plates between non sister _LOCATION_ . in contrast to the wild type this early cellularization step was frequently observed in _PROTEIN_ endosperm indicating a delay of this cytokinetic process . this would indicate that the time required for cell plate formation and maturation is prolonged without wild type _PROTEIN_ . accordingly binucleate cells were detected in _PROTEIN_ endosperm . as _PROTEIN_ transcripts seem to be confined to the posterior pole the effects of _PROTEIN_ mutations on cellularization in other parts of the endosperm could be explained if _PROTEIN_ protein is translocated from the posterior pole towards the other domains of the endosperm . in addition to defective cellularization _PROTEIN_ mutations perturb the ontogenesis of the cyst at the endosperm posterior pole . at the embryo heart stage in the wild type endosperm cyst formation was evident in most seeds with only of seeds containing a weakly discernible cyst . however a complete absence of cyst structure was observed in of the _PROTEIN_ seeds although nodules were consistently apparent around the site at which a cyst would normally form . a similar reduction of cyst was observed in _PROTEIN_ endosperm . cyst formation requires directional migration of _LOCATION_ towards the basal posterior endosperm to generate the cyst . the cytoskeletal tracks that are required for directional _LOCATION_ movement could involve either the microtubule or actin based network as both kind of _LOCATION_ are present at the posterior pole in an arabidopsis relative . we hypothesize that _PROTEIN_ acts on the dynamics of specialized _LOCATION_ thereby enabling local _LOCATION_ migration towards the cyst . we attempted dynamic visualization of actin _LOCATION_ in the wild type endosperm with the _METHOD_ fused to the actin binding domain of mouse talin protein under the control of the promoter . this generated diffuse patterns of _METHOD_ in the posterior pole . this may be due to insufficient optical resolution or to artefacts generated by _METHOD_ talin . no labelling was detected in other parts of the endosperm . dynamic localization of _PROTEIN_ will be necessary to further understand the role of formin during endosperm development . we find that arabidopsis type i formin _PROTEIN_ has biochemical activity that is similar to yeast and mammalian formins . in vitro purified _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cter fragments of _PROTEIN_ nucleate actin filaments that grow at their barbed ends . surprisingly in contrast to mammalian and yeast formins this activity is not supported by the _PROTEIN_ cter fragment of _PROTEIN_ alone indicating that _PROTEIN_ domain and the few amino acids between the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ domains are necessary for nucleating activity . cytokinesis in plants has been thought to involve mostly microtubule dependent structures and vesicular transport in contrast to animal cytokinesis in which actin and contractile forces have a major role . however during plant cytokinesis short actin filaments are assembled de novo at the cell plate . the role of actin in this compartment is unclear but microinjection of profilin a formin interacting protein delays or completely inhibits cell plate formation and actin depolymerizing drugs affect cell plate guidance . based on _PROTEIN_ localization and its biochemical properties these short actin filaments would be assembled through a formin dependent mechanism that is not exclusive to _PROTEIN_ as _PROTEIN_ loss of function shows a delayed cytokinesis in endosperm and not in vegetative tissues . in endosperm _PROTEIN_ loss of function partially affects cytokinesis and morphogenesis . the eventual cellularization and formation of a cyst at the posterior endosperm in _PROTEIN_ mutants could be attributed to functional redundancy with other related formins . in the _PROTEIN_ mutants cell plate expansion between sister and non sister _LOCATION_ was conspicuously stalled during cellularization indicating that _PROTEIN_ is required for completion of cytokinesis . subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to the incipient and expanding cell plate in roots further supports a role in cell plate maturation . similar to _PROTEIN_ mutants completion of the cell plate during cytokinesis is delayed in plant cells that overexpress phragmoplastin . phragmoplastin is a dynamin like protein that is associated with membranous vesicle fusion at the cell plate . one hypothesis to explore is that newly polymerized short actin filaments at the cell plate would participate in fine tuning vesicle trafficking and fusion enabling optimized _LOCATION_ reconstitution as the cell plate expands . our study highlights the importance of actin and associated regulators including formins for the completion of higher plant cytokinesis . it therefore becomes probable that together with microtubules and vesicle trafficking actin filaments participate in higher plant and animal cytokinesis but use distinct scaffolds .
