phytochromes are red photoreceptors that are central to the regulation of plant growth and development . although it is well known that photoactivated phytochromes are translocated into the _LOCATION_ where they interact with a variety of _LOCATION_ proteins and ultimately regulate transcription the _METHOD_ by which these photoreceptors function are not completely understood . in an effort to enhance our understanding of light signaling networks we attempted to identify novel proteins interacting with phytochrome b _PROTEIN_ . using affinity purification in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ overexpressor coupled with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis proteins that interact with _PROTEIN_ in vivo were identified . interactions between _PROTEIN_ and six putative _PROTEIN_ proteins were confirmed by bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation analysis . involvement of these proteins in _PROTEIN_ signaling pathways was also revealed by physiological analysis of the mutants defective in each _PROTEIN_ protein . we further characterized the _PROTEIN_ mutant impaired in the homeobox protein _PROTEIN_ gene . the _PROTEIN_ mutant displayed altered hypocotyl growth under r light as well as defects in _PROTEIN_ seed germination and _PROTEIN_ cotyledon expansion . taken together these results suggest that the _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ is a novel component of the _PROTEIN_ r light signaling pathway .
to understand the highly complex and interconnected networks of the phytochrome signaling pathways better we attempted to isolate _PROTEIN_ complex proteins in arabidopsis in vivo through affinity chromatography and _METHOD_ proteomic analysis . the strategy for purification and identification of _PROTEIN_ complex proteins is illustrated in fig . . seedlings of arabidopsis and transgenic plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with _PROTEIN_ mutant background _PROTEIN_ were irradiated with r light for h to isolate proteins that interact with _PROTEIN_ when the pfr form of _PROTEIN_ is enriched . through affinity chromatography with _METHOD_ antibodies we obtained four protein fractions from the and _PROTEIN_ transgenic seedlings . these fractions were subsequently resolved using gel electrophoresis the immunoprecipitated fractions from the and _PROTEIN_ transgenic seedlings are shown in fig . and respectively . a relatively washing condition was applied to maximize the recovery of proteins that weakly indirectly and/or transiently bind _PROTEIN_ in vivo . we distinguished putative _PROTEIN_ proteins from the protein background by comparing gel patterns of immunoprecipitated fractions of _PROTEIN_ transgenic seedlings with those of seedlings . protein spots found in supernatant fraction of _PROTEIN_ transgenic seedlings were also excluded . of the spots analyzed for peptide _METHOD_ finger printing proteins were identified as putative _PROTEIN_ complex proteins . it is noteworthy that the putative _PROTEIN_ complex proteins included _PROTEIN_ which is highly similar to a protein _PROTEIN_ . we also identified another putative transcription _PROTEIN_ homeobox protein _PROTEIN_ . regulatory proteins involved in protein modification such as protein phosphatase _PROTEIN_ and a putative kinase _PROTEIN_ were identified as putative _PROTEIN_ complex proteins . notably proteins thought to be involved in chloroplast function such as adp _PROTEIN_ pyrophosphorylase _PROTEIN_ and chloroplast biogenesis _PROTEIN_ were also identified as the putative _PROTEIN_ complex proteins . to confirm the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and putative _PROTEIN_ complex proteins shown in table we employed bifc analysis using arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts . plasmids encoding split _METHOD_ proteins with _PROTEIN_ and each putative _PROTEIN_ protein were transformed into arabidopsis protoplasts . after incubation in the dark the transformed protoplasts were irradiated with r light for h immediately prior to observation under a _METHOD_ microscope . interactions between _PROTEIN_ and of the putative _PROTEIN_ proteins were further examined by bifc analysis . among these six were shown to interact with _PROTEIN_ by bifc analysis . _METHOD_ interacted with _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ preferentially in the _LOCATION_ while an interaction between _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ was shown _PROTEIN_ in the cytoplasm . _METHOD_ interacted with _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ and in the cytoplasm . to gain insights into the function of _PROTEIN_ proteins in phytochrome signaling arabidopsis mutants carrying a insertion in genes encoding each _PROTEIN_ protein were analyzed . we measured hypocotyl growth in the and homozygous mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings in response to r fr and b light . the _PROTEIN_ mutant was not included because it was previously reported that _PROTEIN_ displays long hypocotyl phenotype under r and fr light compared to the . none of the mutants examined showed any pronounced effect of fr and b light responses . by contrast four except the mutant displayed significantly different r light responses from those of . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants exhibited reduced inhibition of hypocotyl growth than the under r light . however the _PROTEIN_ and mutants had shorter hypocotyls under r light than the . these results suggest that four _PROTEIN_ proteins function as regulators of r hypocotyl growth response of arabidopsis seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . as the _PROTEIN_ mutant exhibited the greatest changes in hypocotyl growth under r light among the five mutants examined we focused on _PROTEIN_ for detailed analysis . _PROTEIN_ a member of the class i zipper family of transcription _PROTEIN_ is a amino acid protein containing a _LOCATION_ localization signal sequence and two domains . to determine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ protein fused to _METHOD_ at the was transiently _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts . the _METHOD_ protein was clearly localized to the _LOCATION_ further implying that _PROTEIN_ functions as a transcription _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ mutant exhibited long hypocotyl phenotype under r light but it did not show any significant differences from the under fr or b light . as the hypocotyl growth response depends on light intensity we examined whether the _PROTEIN_ mutant exhibited altered hypocotyl growth over a wide range of light fluences . the _PROTEIN_ mutant displayed a significant reduction in the r light response in light fluences ranging from to . by contrast the _PROTEIN_ mutant did not show any pronounced alterations in the fr and b light responses at any of the fluence rates examined . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ functions as a positive regulator of the r hypocotyl growth response in arabidopsis seedlings . we then examined whether _PROTEIN_ affects the response which is primarily mediated by _PROTEIN_ . in this experiment seedlings grown under white light for h were exposed to a pulse of saturating r or fr light before being returned to a period of darkness . compared with the treatment the treatment caused a significant increase in the length of seedlings . in contrary the response was less pronounced in _PROTEIN_ and in _PROTEIN_ than in the . these results demonstrate that the _PROTEIN_ mutation leads to a _PROTEIN_ in the stimulation of hypocotyl elongation . overall these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ plays important roles in the _PROTEIN_ hypocotyl growth response . we noticed that the cotyledon sizes differed between the and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ regulates cotyledon expansion we measured the areas of cotyledons from plants grown in the presence of r fr or b light . as shown in fig . _PROTEIN_ plants grown in r light had smaller cotyledons than plants whereas the _PROTEIN_ plants had nearly cotyledons when exposed to fr light or b light . we further examined the cotyledon growth over the range of r and fr light fluences . the cotyledon area of the _PROTEIN_ seedlings was significantly smaller when the plants were grown under r light at fluences ranging from to . by contrast we did not observe drastic changes in cotyledon growth in plants grown under different fr light fluences examined . these results imply that _PROTEIN_ regulates _PROTEIN_ cotyledon expansion . to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ is involved in other _PROTEIN_ responses we examined the germination frequency of the _PROTEIN_ mutant under r and fr light . we first compared the germination potential of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seeds irradiated by different r light fluences immediately after exposure to a pulse of fr light the seeds were subsequently _PROTEIN_ in the dark . seeds are known to germinate when _PROTEIN_ is activated by r light but the _PROTEIN_ mutant seeds did not germinate under the same conditions . the _PROTEIN_ mutant seeds required more r light fluence for seed germination than the . for example while all of the seeds germinated in response to a pulse of r light only of the _PROTEIN_ mutant seeds germinated under the same conditions . we then analyzed the germination potential of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seeds under _PROTEIN_ germination conditions _PROTEIN_ . under these conditions of the seeds germinated in response to prolonged fr light irradiation whereas the _PROTEIN_ mutant seeds did not germinate at all . we did not observe any significant differences between the germination phenotypes of and _PROTEIN_ mutant seeds . taken together these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is a positive regulator of _PROTEIN_ seed germination .
