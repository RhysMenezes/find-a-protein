in plants the chloroplast _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ is the site of light dependent photosynthetic reactions coupled to _PROTEIN_ synthesis . the ability of the plant cell to build and alter this _LOCATION_ system is essential for efficient photosynthesis . a nucleotide translocator homologous to the bovine mitochondrial adp/atp carrier was previously found in spinach _LOCATION_ . here we have identified and characterized a _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ carrier _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis . sequence homology with the bovine aac and the prediction of chloroplast transit peptides indicated a putative carrier encoded by the _GENE_ gene as a _PROTEIN_ . transiently _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein fusion construct was targeted to the chloroplast . western blotting using a peptide specific antibody together with immunogold electron microscopy revealed a major location of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . previous proteomic analyses identified this protein in chloroplast envelope preparations . recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein specifically imports _PROTEIN_ in exchange for adp across the cytoplasmic _LOCATION_ of escherichia coli . studies on isolated _LOCATION_ from arabidopsis confirmed these observations . the lack of _PROTEIN_ in an arabidopsis t dna insertion mutant caused a reduction in the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ transport and metabolism . _PROTEIN_ is readily _PROTEIN_ in dark grown arabidopsis seedlings and its level remains stable throughout the greening process . its _PROTEIN_ is highest in developing green tissues and in leaves undergoing senescence or abiotic stress . we propose that the _PROTEIN_ protein supplies _PROTEIN_ for energy dependent reactions during _LOCATION_ biogenesis and turnover in plants .
structural analyses of the _PROTEIN_ search with the amino acid sequence of the bovine aac against the arabidopsis protein data base combined with prediction of transit peptides revealed six _LOCATION_ mcf members which is in line with previously published data . among them the product of the _GENE_ gene _PROTEIN_ with a putative carrier function corresponded in size to the previously reported nucleotide _LOCATION_ transporter . the coding region of the _GENE_ gene obtained by screening of an arabidopsis cdna library confirmed the exon assignment in the mips data base . in the same data base five _PROTEIN_ sequence tags were found for arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ indicating that the gene is transcriptionally active . the encoded arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ protein contains amino acids and an n terminal chloroplast transit peptide as indicated by targetp . using advanced bioinformatics analysis for intra chloroplast protein sorting a low cysteine content and a negative _PROTEIN_ index were determined _PROTEIN_ that are in favor of a _LOCATION_ rather than envelope location for this putative protein . nevertheless it was annotated as an envelope protein due to its high hydrophobicity high isoelectric point and putative carrier function . notably two proteomic studies disagree on the envelope localization of the _GENE_ gene product . the mature form shows identity to the bovine aac protein . the _PROTEIN_ termini are and residues respectively longer than the corresponding regions in baac and are rich in both positively and negatively charged residues . the presence of a five glycine repeat in the middle of the n terminus indicates that this region may undergo large conformational changes that could regulate _PROTEIN_ activity . a _PROTEIN_ of four well conserved positively charged residues was proposed to act as a selectivity filter for adenine nucleotides in all aacs . the alignment shows that these residues are also conserved in _PROTEIN_ suggesting a possible substrate preference for adenine nucleotides . as was found in all mcf members _PROTEIN_ contains three repeated homologous regions with highly conserved consensus sequences . the unique aac signature in the third repeat region is only partially conserved in _PROTEIN_ as in the case of two other aacs . the relevance of this signature for binding and/or transport of adenine nucleotides is not clearly understood . nevertheless the detailed analysis of the bovine aac x ray structure indicated that only the first two arginines _PROTEIN_ interact with _PROTEIN_ . various software tested at the _PROTEIN_ website indicated zero to six transmembrane domains for the _PROTEIN_ protein . the reason for this large variability is the presence of many charged residues as well as conserved prolines in the putative tmds of this type of transport protein unusual features for which various software is more or less sensitive as suggested previously . six tmds have been revealed in the crystal structure of the bovine aac . therefore we have used the alignment with the bovine carrier as basis for the presence of six tmds in the _PROTEIN_ structure . in the folding model of the _PROTEIN_ protein the tmds are connected by three loops on the stromal side and two loops on the lumenal side . the stromal loops contain amphipatic helices . for the mitochondrial aac the n and c termini are in the intermembrane space and the adenine nucleotide binding site is on the _PROTEIN_ side of the _LOCATION_ where _PROTEIN_ is synthesized . taking into account that in chloroplasts _PROTEIN_ is synthesized on the stromal side of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and is transported from the stroma into the _LOCATION_ lumen the n and c termini of the _PROTEIN_ protein are expected to be located on the lumenal side of _LOCATION_ . the _PROTEIN_ amino acid sequence was analyzed for structural homologues at the metaserver . as expected substantial structural similarities to the bovine aac were identified and a highly significant jury homology score was provided . the presented structural homology model of _PROTEIN_ is limited to amino acid residues excluding the large n and c termini which have no correspondence in the bovine aac . like the bovine protein the overall structure is basket shaped with a closure on the stromal side and opening on the lumenal side . the backbone exhibits a pseudo fold symmetry due to the presence of three repeated homologous domains . the tmds form a cavity that enters deeply into the protein and the four indicated residues making up the selective filter surround the bottleneck of the cavity . taken together the structural analyses indicate that the product of the _GENE_ gene possesses a chloroplast transit peptide as well as the characteristic sequence features of a mcf and aac member . in vivo and in vitro localization studies of the _PROTEIN_ targeting of a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct was investigated in tobacco leaf protoplasts . as shown in the merge image _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and chl red _METHOD_ colocalized . these data show that _PROTEIN_ is efficiently targeted to the chloroplast . however no information about the intra chloroplast localization could be obtained . for this purpose arabidopsis chloroplast _LOCATION_ subfractions obtained by sucrose density gradient centrifugation were analyzed by western blotting using the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody and its preimmune serum . as shown in fig . a single band with mr of cross reacted with the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody and corresponded to a chloroplast protein _PROTEIN_ located in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the data do not however refute earlier findings suggesting that this protein is also present in the envelope _LOCATION_ . no cross reaction was detected when the corresponding rabbit preimmune serum was used further supporting the specificity of the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . the high purity of the analyzed _LOCATION_ and envelope preparations was confirmed by western blotting with antibodies against corresponding marker proteins such as the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ protein and the inner envelope _PROTEIN_ protein . treatment with m nacl or triton x rendered the kda protein band in the _LOCATION_ fraction as in the case of control _LOCATION_ . only treatment with triton x solubilized the _PROTEIN_ protein indicating that this is a _LOCATION_ spanning protein and supporting the tmds prediction data . the _PROTEIN_ protein was immunolocalized on cryosections containing mesophyll cells of arabidopsis rosette leaves using serial dilutions of the _PROTEIN_ antibody . specific labeling was obtained at dilution of the antibody . the analysis of several sections showed that the immunogold particles were _PROTEIN_ found in chloroplasts . particles were also occasionally detected on _LOCATION_ . the _LOCATION_ cell wall _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and organelles including mitochondria were not labeled . in chloroplasts the distribution of the immunogold particles which reflects the distribution of the _PROTEIN_ protein was nonuniform . the particles were mostly associated with the stroma exposed regions of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and of the grana stacks as also demonstrated for the chloroplast _PROTEIN_ synthase and rarely associated with the stroma and envelope or inside the grana stacks . control sections without primary antibodies were not labeled . taken together these studies demonstrate a chloroplast location for the _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ and functional characterization of the _PROTEIN_ protein in e. coli analyses data indicated adenine nucleotides as the most likely substrates for transport by _PROTEIN_ . to study its substrate specificity and kinetics for transport we _PROTEIN_ a recombinant xpress _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein in e. coli cells . fig . shows a western blot with xpress antibody of protein extracts obtained by cell fractionation and at different steps of the purification process . a single cross reacting band was detected in the iptg induced e. coli cells containing the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plasmid but not in the iptg induced cells lacking the coding sequence in the plasmid . the majority of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein was found in the _LOCATION_ fraction a finding not least important for the functional characterization in intact bacterial cells . the _PROTEIN_ protein was purified from the detergent solubilized _LOCATION_ protein extract by chromatography on a nickel column followed by a _PROTEIN_ column . the _PROTEIN_ protein was and fold enriched in and respectively compared with the crude _LOCATION_ extract . the identity of the purified protein was confirmed by western blotting with the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody as well as by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis . _METHOD_ staining revealed the _PROTEIN_ protein as the _PROTEIN_ protein band in sample emphasizing the importance of this protein purification system as a tool for crystallization and further characterization . fig . shows a time dependence for the uptake of _PROTEIN_ and adp into intact e. coli cells _PROTEIN_ the recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein . in the background non time dependent binding of nucleotides was observed in iptg treated cells lacking the _PROTEIN_ insert representing a maximum of and of the assayed uptake of _PROTEIN_ and adp respectively . furthermore radioactive nucleotides were detected in washed and disrupted _PROTEIN_ cells but not in the control cells indicating that the assayed transport activity is dependent on the presence of the _PROTEIN_ protein . the ratio of _PROTEIN_ to adp uptake was about suggesting a preferred import of _PROTEIN_ versus adp into e. coli cells . this is opposite to the preferred import of adp versus _PROTEIN_ by heterologously _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis mitochondrial aacs . for determination of the km and vmax values of the _PROTEIN_ catalyzed transport the e. coli cells were incubated with radioactive adenine nucleotides for min . the apparent km values for _PROTEIN_ and adp were about i.e . intermediate between those reported for arabidopsis and mammalian aacs when _PROTEIN_ and assayed in e. coli cells . the calculated vmax value for _PROTEIN_ and adp uptake were and nmol mg protein h . both vmax values are in the same range as those determined for the arabidopsis mitochondrial aacs _PROTEIN_ in e. coli i.e . nmol mg protein h . the presence of cccp increased the apparent km value of _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ to and the corresponding vmax value to nmol mg protein h . the corresponding values for adp were not affected by the presence of cccp . the _PROTEIN_ that _PROTEIN_ has a lower affinity for binding _PROTEIN_ in non energized e. coli _LOCATION_ could be due to a protein conformational change such that the substrate becomes loosely bound and is faster released on the other side of the _LOCATION_ . the km values were only slightly lowered by cccp in the case of the mitochondrial aacs _PROTEIN_ in e. coli . the mechanistic reason for this discrepancy with respect to cccp is not known . nevertheless the _PROTEIN_ transport activity shows other differences as well . for example export of adp by _PROTEIN_ is inhibited by cccp at variance with the same activity performed by the mitochondrial aacs . to investigate the nucleotide transport specificity of _PROTEIN_ we performed uptake of _PROTEIN_ into e. coli cells _PROTEIN_ the recombinant protein in the presence of excess of various nonlabeled nucleotides . in comparison with the control uptake _PROTEIN_ competed with the highest efficiency closely followed by adp . the guanine nucleotides did not affect the _PROTEIN_ uptake suggesting that although they could bind to the carrier protein they are not substrates for transport . adp _PROTEIN_ and phosphate did not compete with the _PROTEIN_ uptake indicating that _PROTEIN_ is not involved in neither nucleotide sugar nor phosphate transport . the competition data strongly support that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ specifically transports adenine nucleotides as reported for mammalian aacs and in contrast to maize aac which can also transport guanine nucleotides . most mcf members catalyze strict solute exchange reactions . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ e. coli cells were preloaded with _PROTEIN_ followed by back exchange with nonlabeled external substrates and the released nucleotides were separated by thin layer chromatography . as shown in fig . disrupted preloaded cells contained both radioactive _PROTEIN_ and adp indicating that an uptake of _PROTEIN_ had taken place and that part of it was converted to adp in the _LOCATION_ . no significant amount of radioactive nucleotides was released after the addition of buffer . a preferential export of adp occurred during the back exchange with externally added adenine nucleotides and was effectively inhibited by cccp . in planta functional analyses of the _PROTEIN_ nucleotide uptake and exchange data obtained from functional _PROTEIN_ of the recombinant _PROTEIN_ in e. coli were compared with those in arabidopsis _LOCATION_ . all experiments using _LOCATION_ were carried out in darkness when _PROTEIN_ binding and hydrolysis by the catalytic portion _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ synthase is extremely low . under our experimental conditions the uptake of _PROTEIN_ into _LOCATION_ had a fast linear phase and reached a plateau level of pmol of _PROTEIN_ chl within about min . the estimated apparent km for _PROTEIN_ was about i.e . a significantly lower value than the km of the recombinant _PROTEIN_ as determined in e. coli . another difference from _PROTEIN_ mediated transport in e. coli is that in addition to _PROTEIN_ and adp gdp also competed with the uptake of _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ . these data imply that in addition to _PROTEIN_ there exist other sites for _PROTEIN_ binding and transport in _LOCATION_ including the previously characterized binding to the _PROTEIN_ synthase . nevertheless our data also indicate similar kinetics to the ones reported for nucleotide uptake in isolated mitochondria . to investigate the internal affinities of _LOCATION_ for adenine nucleotides we carried out back exchange experiments in _LOCATION_ preloaded with _PROTEIN_ . preloaded _LOCATION_ contained radioactive _PROTEIN_ and adp in a ratio of about and showed a preferential export of adp supporting the data obtained for _PROTEIN_ in e. coli cells . because incubation with adp is known to abolish the _PROTEIN_ activity of _PROTEIN_ its interference in the observed exchange is not very likely . the _PROTEIN_ that even gdp induced export of adp has significance for the previously characterized ndpk activity in the _LOCATION_ lumen . because gdp competed with _PROTEIN_ uptake and induced adp export there must exist another transport system than _PROTEIN_ for gdp in _LOCATION_ . to determine the physiological influence of _PROTEIN_ on the availability of adenine nucleotides inside the chloroplast _LOCATION_ lumen a _PROTEIN_ line with a t dna insertion in the _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ was analyzed and compared with wt . the homozygoty of this line was confirmed by pcr and the lack of _PROTEIN_ was verified by western blotting of isolated _LOCATION_ . as a control the amount of _PROTEIN_ was analyzed and shown to be at comparable levels in the wt and the _PROTEIN_ mutant . uptake of _PROTEIN_ into dark incubated _LOCATION_ isolated from the _PROTEIN_ mutant was reduced to and of the wt levels . interconversion of _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ was reduced to of the wt levels . additional phenotypic effects of _PROTEIN_ disruption included about reduction in the _LOCATION_ content as compared with wt _PROTEIN_ resulting in pale green leaves of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pattern in get information about the in planta role of _PROTEIN_ we addressed several questions whether _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene in arabidopsis is restricted to photosynthetic tissues and whether it occurs at specific stages of development and/or under certain stress conditions . as shown by northern blot experiments a significant amount of _PROTEIN_ transcript was detected in seedlings grown in darkness and its level did not change significantly during a period of up to h of greening . the level of the _PROTEIN_ protein in the corresponding protein extracts followed the transcript pattern as revealed by western blotting with the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . for comparison the transcription of maize mitochondrial aacs readily occurs in darkness and _PROTEIN_ as soon as the tissue becomes photosynthetically active . we also investigated _PROTEIN_ during various leaf developmental stages . our data revealed that the amount of the _PROTEIN_ transcript was high in developing leaves _PROTEIN_ during maturation and increased again during senescence to levels exceeding those present in developing leaves . the _PROTEIN_ level in the corresponding protein extracts generally followed the level of corresponding transcripts . next we assayed _PROTEIN_ in leaves exposed to various abiotic stress conditions . although the amounts of the _PROTEIN_ transcript were increased during wounding light stress oxidative stress salt stress and desiccation a drastic reduction was detected under heat shock conditions . similarly the exposure of leaves to low temperature led to a slight _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ transcript level . as before the protein pattern resembled the one of the transcript . finally the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was investigated in various arabidopsis organs . the highest levels of _PROTEIN_ transcript and protein were detected in developing photosynthetic organs such as leaves flower buds and green siliques followed by fully developed organs such as roots flowers cauline and rosette leaves and least in the stem . for comparison the mitochondrial aacs show a similar _PROTEIN_ pattern in all tissues pointing to a more general role in plant metabolism . high _PROTEIN_ levels in arabidopsis dark grown seedlings in developing and senescent leaves may have relevance for initiation of biogenesis and turnover of the photosynthetic apparatus in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ .
