male _METHOD_ is predicted to encode a fatty acid reductase required for pollen wall development in arabidopsis . transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ in tobacco leaves resulted in the accumulation of significant levels of and fatty alcohols . _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ fused with green _METHOD_ protein revealed that an amino terminal transit peptide targets the _METHOD_ to _LOCATION_ . the _LOCATION_ localization of _METHOD_ is biologically important because genetic complementation of _METHOD_ in _METHOD_ homozygous plants was dependent on the presence of its amino terminal transit peptide or that of the rubisco small subunit protein amino terminal transit peptide . in addition two domains nad h binding domain and sterile domain conserved in _METHOD_ and its homologs were also shown to be essential for _METHOD_ function in pollen exine development by genetic complementation testing . direct biochemical analysis revealed that purified recombinant _METHOD_ enzyme is able to convert palmitoyl acyl carrier protein to the corresponding alcohol with nad h as the preferred electron donor . using optimized reaction conditions _METHOD_ exhibits a km for acyl carrier protein of a vmax of nmol and a catalytic efficiency/km of . based on the high homology of _METHOD_ to other characterized fatty acid reductases it was surprising that _METHOD_ showed no activity against palmitoyl or other acyl coenzyme a however this is consistent with its _LOCATION_ localization . in summary genetic and biochemical evidence demonstrate an _METHOD_ mediated conserved _LOCATION_ pathway for the production of fatty alcohols that are essential for pollen wall biosynthesis in arabidopsis .
defective pollen grains of _METHOD_ were incubated with diamidino phenylindole and iodine potassium iodide . dapi staining showed that both the wild type and _METHOD_ display normal mature pollen grains with a single vegetative _LOCATION_ and two sperm _LOCATION_ at the mature pollen developmental stage . ki staining revealed that _METHOD_ pollen grains had a rough outer surface compared with the wild type consistent with the defective pollen wall development of _METHOD_ . in agreement with previous reports _METHOD_ pollen grains were sensitive to acetolysis treatment and scanning electron microscopy _PROTEIN_ analysis revealed that the _METHOD_ pollen grains collapsed and attained a severely shrunken appearance . previous investigation predicted that _METHOD_ and a _METHOD_ homolog were localized in chloroplasts based on the presence of an n terminal transit peptide . our targetp chlorop and mitoprot ii version sequence analyses consistently suggested that the _METHOD_ protein contained a putative _LOCATION_ targeting _LOCATION_ peptide with amino acid residues at the n terminus . in order to determine the subcellular localization of _METHOD_ we made two constructs _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ contained the full length _METHOD_ cdna translationally fused to the terminus of _METHOD_ and in _METHOD_ _METHOD_ the n terminal transit peptide portion of the _METHOD_ cdna was deleted and the _METHOD_ polypeptide was translationally fused with _METHOD_ . chloroplasts were identified by the _METHOD_ of chlorophyll and a translational fusion construct of the mitochondrial subunit with red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ was used to mark the _LOCATION_ . analysis using arabidopsis protoplasts from leaf cells showed that the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signal colocalized with the chlorophyll _METHOD_ signal in chloroplasts but not obviously with the _METHOD_ signal in arabidopsis protoplasts consistent with _METHOD_ localization in _LOCATION_ . in contrast the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signals were observed in the cytoplasm and did not colocalize with the _METHOD_ signal or the chlorophyll _METHOD_ signal . furthermore we fused the dna fragment of the _METHOD_ n terminal transit peptide to _METHOD_ and confirmed that the transit peptide of _METHOD_ is able to target the _METHOD_ into chloroplasts using tp _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . in addition the localization of _METHOD_ in _LOCATION_ was also confirmed in transgenic tobacco leaves transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and free _METHOD_ . the _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ was shown only in tapetal cells at or very shortly after young microspores were released from the tetrad by in situ rna hybridization and promoter fused with the gus reporter gene analyses . in this study we observed the _METHOD_ signal of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the tapetal cells at the free microspore stage in the stable transgenic lines . furthermore the _METHOD_ signal in the anthers of transgenic lines harboring _METHOD_ _METHOD_ showed higher _PROTEIN_ signals in tapetal cells and anther locules compared with those of transgenic lines containing _METHOD_ suggesting that the n terminal transit peptide of _METHOD_ is responsible for correct _METHOD_ localization the absence of which possibly affects its turnover . the biological importance of the _METHOD_ localization to _LOCATION_ was confirmed from the observation that the construct _METHOD_ without the n terminal transit peptide encoding sequence of _METHOD_ could not complement the defective pollen wall development in _METHOD_ homozygous mutants whereas _METHOD_ rescued the defect of _METHOD_ pollen wall development . the arabidopsis rubisco small subunit protein contains an n terminal transit peptide that has been shown to effectively target this protein to chloroplasts . to test whether rtp can functionally replace the n terminal transit peptide of _METHOD_ protein we made the construct _METHOD_ rtp _METHOD_ in which the fragment of rtp translationally replaced the n terminal transit peptide of _METHOD_ and transformed it to _METHOD_ mutants . twenty one independent transgenic lines containing rtp _METHOD_ in the _METHOD_ homozygous background were obtained . acetolysis treatment and _PROTEIN_ analysis showed that transgenic lines displayed normal pollen exine development compared with the wild type suggesting the rescued pollen wall phenotype of _METHOD_ mutants by this construct . the pollen grains of four transgenic lines showed partially resistant to acetolysis treatment and less defective outer surface analyzed by _PROTEIN_ suggesting a partially rescued phenotype of pollen exine formation . seven transgenic lines showed defects of pollen exine development similar to _METHOD_ which may have resulted from the difference between the rtp and the n terminal transit peptide of _METHOD_ . these results confirmed that the localization of _METHOD_ to _LOCATION_ is critical for its function in anther development . consistent with a previous investigation analysis of the _METHOD_ protein using the smart protein structure prediction tool revealed that the _METHOD_ protein contains two conserved domains the nad h binding domain between residues and and the sterile domain between residues and . _METHOD_ and other fars were observed to contain the conserved nad h binding motif between residues and and the active site motif yx k of nadp dependent proteins between residues and implying a functional role of these motifs . to examine whether these domains/motifs are essential for _METHOD_ function we made several constructs containing the mutated _METHOD_ fragments driven by the _METHOD_ promoter . the construct containing the deleted sd sequence _METHOD_ _METHOD_ or deletion of the nbd domain _METHOD_ _METHOD_ could not rescue the defective pollen exine development in the _METHOD_ homozygous background suggesting an essential role of both sd and nbd domains in _METHOD_ function . furthermore the constructs deleted for the nad h binding motif or the active site motif yx k of nadp dependent proteins failed to complement the defective pollen exine phenotype of _METHOD_ in the transgenic plants suggesting the essential role of these two conserved motifs in the nbd of _METHOD_ . although _METHOD_ is predicted as a fatty acid reductase involved in fatty alcohol formation and recombinant bacteria _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ can produce and alcohols a comprehensive biochemical characterization of this enzyme has not been performed . to this end we cloned the full length _METHOD_ cdna into the _PROTEIN_ vector and introduced it into e. coli . the recombinant _METHOD_ protein was purified by affinity chromatography and subjected to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . compared with the predicted size of about kd the molecular _METHOD_ of the affinity purified protein ran somewhat faster on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . because the data presented herein show that _METHOD_ is localized in _LOCATION_ in which long chain fatty acids are de novo synthesized and while esterified to _PROTEIN_ we analyzed _METHOD_ activity with acyl _PROTEIN_ . using labeled fatty acyl _PROTEIN_ we detected strong activity only with _PROTEIN_ trace activity with _PROTEIN_ and no activity with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ indicating that _METHOD_ prefers palmitoyl _PROTEIN_ as a substrate . furthermore no activity was detected with the equivalent acyl coa substrates . to further investigate the substrate specificity of recombinant _METHOD_ unlabeled myristoyl _PROTEIN_ palmitoyl _PROTEIN_ palmitoleoyl _PROTEIN_ and stearoyl _PROTEIN_ were tested with the purified _METHOD_ enzyme in the presence of nad h and only palmitoyl _PROTEIN_ was reduced to alcohol . the specificity of _METHOD_ against palmitoyl _PROTEIN_ was confirmed by using deuterium labeled palmitoyl _PROTEIN_ as substrate which yielded a product at the same retention time as hexadecanol but with a _METHOD_ ion relative to the non _METHOD_ labeled standard . to more comprehensively characterize the _METHOD_ enzyme we compared the palmitoyl _PROTEIN_ reducing activity in the presence of nad h versus nadh . under the same experimental conditions chromatographic analysis revealed that the recombinant _METHOD_ has higher activity in the presence of nad h relative to that using nadh and no alcohol was detectable if nad h or nadh was omitted suggesting that _METHOD_ activity is dependent on the presence of either nad h or nadh . furthermore we show that the optimal ph value for the _METHOD_ activity is . additionally assays at various temperatures showed that the optimal working temperature for the _METHOD_ converting palmitoyl _PROTEIN_ to the alcohol is . under the condition of optimum ph and temperature the recombinant _METHOD_ has a km of for palmitoyl _PROTEIN_ and a vmax of nmol . enzyme activity was measured by the assay with affinity purified _METHOD_ protein and various concentrations of palmitoyl _PROTEIN_ . catalytic efficiency means and se values are based on four replicates . to demonstrate the physiological role of _METHOD_ activity in producing fatty acyl alcohols we transiently _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ protein in tobacco leaves using a cowpea mosaic virus rna based _PROTEIN_ system . the constructed vector peaq _METHOD_ was transformed into tobacco leaves and overexpression of _METHOD_ protein was confirmed by western blot analysis using an _METHOD_ specific antibody of the tobacco leaf extracts d after agrobacterium tumefaciens infiltration . the lipidic compositions of chloroform extractable cuticular waxes cutin monomers and total soluble lipids were analyzed in the transgenic lines using gas chromatography _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and gas chromatography flame ionization detection and compared with lines carrying the empty vector peaq as the control . from gc fid analysis we observed that the amounts of total wax and total soluble lipids per of tobacco leaves in the peaq _METHOD_ lines were very close to those of the control lines . in contrast the total cutin amount per of tobacco leaves was significantly higher in the peaq _METHOD_ lines compared with the control lines . interestingly compared with the control lines significant increases of the contents of hexacosanol octadecanol and _PROTEIN_ alkane were observed in the wax of tobacco leaves harboring peaq _METHOD_ as well as increased levels of hexacosanol and _PROTEIN_ fatty acid in internal lipids . in addition significant accumulations of hexacosanol octadecanol octadecanoic acid oleic acid eicosanoic acid docosanoic acid and unknown cutin monomer were observed in the cutin monomers of the transgenic tobacco leaves . these results suggested that _METHOD_ can synthesize fatty alcohols in plants .
