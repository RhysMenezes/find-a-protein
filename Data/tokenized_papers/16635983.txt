typical _METHOD_ _METHOD_ based protein lists from purified fractions are confounded by the absence of tools for evaluating contaminants . in this report we compare the results of a standard survey experiment using an ion trap _METHOD_ spectrometer with those obtained using dual isotope labeling and a q tof _METHOD_ spectrometer to quantify the degree of enrichment of proteins in purified subcellular fractions of arabidopsis _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . incorporation of a stable isotope either or during trypsinization allowed relative quantification of the degree of enrichment of proteins within _LOCATION_ after phase partitioning with polyethylene glycol/dextran mixtures . the ratios allowed the quantification of _LOCATION_ associated proteins with showing _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ enrichment equal to or greater than _PROTEIN_ dependent proton pumps canonical _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins . enriched proteins included several hallmark _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins such as h _PROTEIN_ aquaporins receptor like kinases and various transporters as well as a number of proteins with unknown functions . most importantly a comparison of the datasets from a sequencing survey analysis using the ion trap _METHOD_ spectrometer with that from the quantitative dual isotope labeling ratio method indicates that as many as one fourth of the putative survey identifications are biological contaminants rather than bona fide _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins .
although the ion trap does not have sufficient resolution to quantify small isotopic shifts such as from labeling compared with a q tof _METHOD_ spectrometer it has a shorter duty cycle and is therefore capable of sequencing a larger number of peptides in a typical lc analysis . to assess sample complexity and identify as many potential _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins as possible we first conducted three independent lc analyses of a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ enriched fraction using an ion trap _METHOD_ spectrometer . to quantify _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ enrichment we applied an labeling strategy to the upper and lower phases of two phase partitioned samples also using a lc separation . this method is similar to the lopit technique used by dunkley et al . . due to our choice of isotopic labels these samples were analyzed using a q tof _METHOD_ spectrometer because of the advantage offered by using a more highly resolving _METHOD_ spectrometer . multiple studies have documented the variability of the ability of _METHOD_ search engines to accurately search through data minimizing both false positives and false negatives . false positive rates are found to be a function of several variables including sample complexity sample handling charge state _METHOD_ platform database size and the _METHOD_ search program used . although some search engines such as mascot attempt to provide a probabilistic estimate of peptide identification it is not surprising that such search engines perform less than perfectly . an empirical approach that has proven effective is a reverse database strategy . in this strategy _METHOD_ spectra are compared with the database of interest known as the forward database as well as with a reverse database . the reverse database contains every protein sequence from the forward database with its sequence reversed . because the databases are of the same size and amino acid content it is expected that the number of chance hits will be similar in the forward and reverse databases . because the ion trap was operated in a mode where a preference was set for doubly charged peptides few singly charged peptides were observed . as a result the _METHOD_ cutoff mascot scores were calculated only for doubly and triply charged peptides . the doubly and triply charged peptides had cutoffs of and respectively for mascot . for q tof data the _METHOD_ thresholds are presented in fig . . the singly charged peptides had a threshold of whereas doubly and triply charged peptides had a threshold of and respectively . samples were digested in aqueous/methanol solutions and resulting peptides were separated via scx . each analysis was processed separately by the criteria described above . after combining the results from the protein identifications there were protein identifications made by peptides unique to one locus in the genome . this list of peptides is provided in supplemental table . of the proteins identifications were single peptide identifications . for proteins identified by only one peptide annotated _METHOD_ spectra are provided in supplemental fig . . of the identifications were observed in all three analyses whereas were observed in two or more analyses . to the best of our knowledge this is the largest survey to date of arabidopsis _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . many of the observed proteins were expected _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ residents such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and receptor like kinases _PROTEIN_ . several other proteins of interest such as non _PROTEIN_ g proteins subunits and novel proteins were also identified . however among these observations were other identified proteins that would not be expected to co purify with _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . some of these unexpected identifications included _METHOD_ of cytochrome porins ribosomal proteins proton pyrophosphatase _PROTEIN_ tonoplast integral proteins and _LOCATION_ type h _PROTEIN_ subunits . these may represent _LOCATION_ mitochondrial soluble and _LOCATION_ contaminants and have been observed in various _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ survey studies . whether these proteins are _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized or simply represent hyperabundant species from other _LOCATION_ that are contaminants is not readily apparent from simple surveys . in the first isotopic labeling experiment the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ containing phase was digested in enriched water whereas the endomembrane fraction was digested in natural abundance water . the labels were reversed in the second experiment . from here forward in the text all reported ratios are normalized so that upper phase enriched proteins are always shown as values greater than one . using the criteria described above for protein identification there were proteins quantified in the first experiment and in the second experiment . peptides from the experiments are reported in supplemental table . between the two experiments proteins were quantified . of these proteins were identified by the sequencing of only one peptide . an example _METHOD_ spectrum for a peptide used to describe a single peptide identification is provided in fig . . the _METHOD_ spectra for the remaining proteins identified by a single peptide are provided in supplemental fig . . although there is a large overlap between the survey dataset and the isotopically labeled datasets there are also significant numbers of protein identifications unique to each dataset . a comparison of overlap between the ion trap and two isotopic labeling experiments is provided in fig . . in either of the isotopic labeling experiments proteins showing enrichment equal to or greater than an aha were classified as _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ enriched . by considering each experiment independently biases resulting from the labeling method were avoided . in total proteins showed _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ enrichment . those characterized by multiple peptides are presented in table i whereas proteins described by only one peptide are presented in table ii . a _PROTEIN_ transform of all proteins quantified in the first dataset is provided as an example of the protein distributions . as a reference with which to compare isotopic measurements vanadate sensitive _PROTEIN_ assay results which are used as a measure for arabidopsis h _PROTEIN_ abundance are reported in fig . for survey data as well as both isotopic labeling experiments . in a recent study using icat for quantification of peptides from microsomal proteins of arabidopsis proteins were quantified . another study also used the icat reagent to quantify proteins demonstrating that were legitimate mitochondrial proteins . based on these other numbers versus our own labeling performed similarly and is a legitimate alternative as a stable isotope labeling strategy . from the proteins that showed _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ enrichment are predicted to possess one or more transmembrane domains . many of these are considered canonical _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ identifications as determined by alternative methods for localization including microscopic histochemical or reporter gene measurements . in addition another proteins are predicted to possess a gpi anchor that would confine them to a _LOCATION_ . one other protein is predicted to possess an amino terminal myristoylation that would also facilitate _LOCATION_ localization . finally four other proteins are predicted to either possess one transmembrane domain or alternatively to possess an amino terminal myristoylation site . therefore proteins are likely physically tethered to the _LOCATION_ representing of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fraction enriched proteins . the large fraction of hydrophobic protein identified by this method validates the digestion and fractionation scheme used as a legitimate method for analysis of _LOCATION_ proteins . many of the remaining proteins such as two remorin like proteins two developmentally regulated _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ polypeptide _METHOD_ a phospholipase d phospholipase c and two quinone reductases are documented to interact strongly with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . after assessing molecular functions using the gene ontology tool available at tair transporters formed the largest group of enriched _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins . the largest group of transporters was the _PROTEIN_ which are proteins involved in water transport across the _LOCATION_ . of the predicted _PROTEIN_ in the genome were observed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the ion trap survey . the same were observed in the q tof analysis and all showed significant _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ enrichment . another group of hallmark _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ transporters are the _PROTEIN_ of which six _METHOD_ were identified _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . of these only _PROTEIN_ has definitively been proven to possess _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization . from the isotopic labeling data _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were quantified and all showed ratios typical of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein enrichment in the upper phase . among quantified proteins there were two _PROTEIN_ binding cassette superfamily transporters _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and both were _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ enriched . besides the two previously described genes five other _PROTEIN_ binding cassette superfamily members were described in the ion trap data _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . multiple sugar transporters were also observed . the known role of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in signal transduction is supported by the larger fraction of kinases identified in the survey and quantified samples as compared with the entire genome . from the ion trap survey of the identifications were assigned kinase activity whereas of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ enriched proteins possessed kinase activity . kinases comprised only of proteins not showing significant _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ enrichment . _PROTEIN_ are a large family of ser/thr kinases with over members predicted from the arabidopsis genome . although they are believed to be _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ residents very little is known about the family as a whole . in total _PROTEIN_ were identified in the ion trap survey . from these proteins _PROTEIN_ were quantified from the q tof data and eight of these showed _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ enrichment . of the four remaining _PROTEIN_ all showed some enrichment in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ enriched upper phase . multiple _METHOD_ observed here are previously undescribed in recent _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteomic surveys . cpks are a family of kinases requiring calcium for activation and that contain the kinase and calmodulin like domains within one polypeptide . none of the _METHOD_ has a clearly assigned function to date . from this family three were characterized in the ion trap survey data _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . from the isotopic ratio measurements there were four cpks identified that showed _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ enrichment _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . one isoform _PROTEIN_ did not show enrichment consistent with _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization but did show noticeable enrichment . using microscopic observations of proteins attached to green _METHOD_ protein prior work found that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized whereas _PROTEIN_ was reported to be _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ located . also present in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fraction was a member of the raf subfamily of the mitogen activated protein kinase kinase kinase family with no described function or phenotype . proteins with hydrolase activity also made up a large fraction of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ identifications from both the ion trap survey and upper phase enriched proteins identified with the q tof _METHOD_ spectrometer . among proteins with hydrolase activity were a phospholipase d _PROTEIN_ isoform and a phospholipase c isoform with prior studies demonstrating the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization of these proteins using immunoblotting . the _PROTEIN_ was shown to bind oleic acid and is proposed to play a role in wound response . nearly one fifth of all arabidopsis genes encode proteins whose sequences provides no clue to their catalytic functions . the novel proteins with unassigned function are of great interest . within the ion trap survey identifications proteins had no assigned molecular function whereas of the q tof _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ enriched proteins had no clear role . among these proteins were two drepp _METHOD_ . a prior study found that a drepp isoform showed temporary up regulation in response to cold treatment and suggested a role in calcium mediated cold _PROTEIN_ . multiple fasciclin like arabinogalactans were quantified showing enrichment in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . this group of proteins has no assigned molecular function but in vertebrate _METHOD_ arabinogalactans play a role in cell adhesion . these proteins have been observed or predicted in prior studies and their _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization is phospholipase c sensitive . other proteins were identified with no assigned molecular function . one is an integral protein that showed fold enrichment in the second isotopic labeling experiment . this protein appears to be largely confined to root tissue based on microarray experiments reported at the arabidopsis _LOCATION_ protein library . another one of these proteins is predicted to be _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized by a gpi anchor . also present were two other proteins with no discernible function or homologs with defined function . to the best of our knowledge none of these four proteins has been described in proteomic studies . remorins are a group of proteins that have no transmembrane domains or lipid attachment domains but are found to be _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized and enriched in lipid raft preparations . although two identified remorin like proteins have putative functions of dna binding this is likely not their true role . first identified as dna binding proteins they were _PROTEIN_ shown to bind other polyanions as well particularly oligogalacturonides when phosphorylated with significantly higher affinity than for dna . additionally microscopy indicates that remorins form filamentous fibers in vitro that interact with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in apical regions particularly root tips but there is no clear biological function for these proteins . our isotopic measurements clearly establish _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ enrichment for these two proteins . identification of a protein in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ enriched fractions does not necessarily make the protein a bona fide _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ identification . this protein may be co localizing to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or alternatively a hyperabundant protein from a contaminating endomembrane . this is the primary difficulty with organellar proteomics . the isotopic measurements we observed here help to clarify this issue . different organelles showed varying levels of depletion from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ enriched phase . the most significant contamination comes from _LOCATION_ components such as _PROTEIN_ and vatpase subunits which are considered canonical _LOCATION_ proteins . _LOCATION_ proteins identified by two or more peptides are presented in table iii . members of these three groups have been observed in multiple _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ investigations and have also been reported in detergent resistant _LOCATION_ preparations from arabidopsis and tobacco . using immunological techniques robinson et al . detected these proteins at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in pea as well . most of these proteins typically showed fold enrichment in the upper phase in our experiments . there were multiple proteins observed that are likely to be of _LOCATION_ origin identified by multiple peptides . among the identifications were three _METHOD_ of cytochrome . we also observed a protein called shepherd _PROTEIN_ which is a kda heat shock protein with _LOCATION_ localization that assists folding of the secreted peptide hormone clavata . in addition to these proteins non unique peptides representing multiple _METHOD_ of luminal binding protein an _LOCATION_ chaperone protein showed similar levels of enrichment . although these proteins seem likely to be contaminants other reports in the literature suggest that the issue is more complex . using an driven transient _PROTEIN_ system marmagne et al . reported _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization for the same cytochrome observed here . in this study all cytochrome _METHOD_ showed levels of contamination similar to other _LOCATION_ proteins suggesting that these proteins are not _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized . as a comparison a reference western blot analysis was performed for a marker for _LOCATION_ . multiple mitochondrial proteins were also observed in this study with most showing fold depletion from the upper phase . some example mitochondrial proteins are presented in table v. on this list were three porin _METHOD_ which are voltage gated anion channels that form barrels . two of these _METHOD_ were also identified in the previously described _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ investigation and one was shown to be _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized via a transient _PROTEIN_ system similar to that for the above mentioned cytochrome . in our samples the porins also showed levels of depletion similar to each other as well as to other mitochondrial proteins . again this is inconsistent with the observations of marmagne et al . who suggested that these porin _METHOD_ were _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized . there were also multiple chloroplast proteins identified by multiple peptides including multiple chlorophyll binding proteins and a ribulose bisphosphate _PROTEIN_ activase . most of these proteins showed fold or greater depletion from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ containing upper phase . several of these proteins are provided in table vi . listed in table vii are proteins that were identified in all three ion trap surveys and whose q tof derived isotopic ratios showed less than fold _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ enrichment in isotopic labeling experiments . these proteins likely represent the abundant endomembrane and soluble proteins that are contaminating _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fractions .
all reagents were _PROTEIN_ from sigma/aldrich unless otherwise noted . arabidopsis thaliana ecotype columbia was grown at in h light in liquid culture consisting of mes murashige and skoog salts and sucrose . at weeks of age whole seedlings were harvested . unless otherwise noted all subsequent steps were performed at in a cold room or on ice . tissue was weighed and then suspended in ice cold homogenization buffer mm edta mm naf mm polyvinylpyrrolidone mm _METHOD_ pepstatin e bestatin phenanthroline and mm dtt at g of ml of homogenization buffer . the suspension was ground three times in a commercial kitchen style blender for s filtered through two layers of miracloth and subjected to centrifugation at g for min . the supernatant was centrifuged at g for min and the pellet was subjected to two phase partitioning using polyethylene glycol and dextran mm kcl mm mm dtt and mm edta as described previously . the upper phase was diluted fold in resuspension buffer and mm edta whereas the lower phase was diluted in the same buffer . the _LOCATION_ were collected by ultracentrifugation at g for h pellets were washed one more time prior to final resuspension in ml of resuspension buffer and the protein content was determined by bca assay . following protein quantification of upper and lower phase proteins were separated via _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ on tris hcl criterion gels in _PROTEIN_ mm tris bromphenol blue glycerol and mm dtt . following electrophoresis proteins were electrotransferred onto pvdf plus _LOCATION_ in transfer buffer methanol mm glycine and mm tris . after rinsing in tbst mm nacl mm kcl and tween the _LOCATION_ were then blocked overnight at in blotto defatted milk protein in tbst . the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker antibody was diluted in blotto . the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker was diluted in blotto . following incubation with primary antibodies the blots were rinsed with tbst and then incubated with secondary horseradish peroxidase conjugated antibodies diluted in tbst . samples were imaged using chemiluminescence _METHOD_ . the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and endomembrane fractions were also subjected to vanadate sensitive _PROTEIN_ assays to quantify enrichment for _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proton pumps as described previously . for relative quantitation of biological samples mg of protein from the upper and lower phases were incubated in mm at for h and then pelleted in a microcentrifuge . pellets were resuspended in of mm tris mm and mm nacl . the resuspensions were thermally denatured for min in boiling water cooled followed by the addition of dtt to a final concentration of mm and lyophilized in a rotary evaporator speedvac . after lyophilization samples were resuspended in of dry methanol using a sonicating bath . this was followed by the addition of of natural abundance double distilled or enriched water and of lyophilized sequencing grade modified trypsin was added at . the final composition of the solution was methanol mm tris mm mm nacl and mm dtt . the digests were allowed to proceed for h at and an additional of trypsin were added . after allowing the digest to proceed overnight the reactions were clarified by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge and the supernatant was removed . the reactions were then terminated by addition of formic acid to of the original volume and the reciprocally labeled samples were combined and diluted fold . samples were then desalted via solid phase extraction with a spec _PROTEIN_ cartridge and eluted using acetonitrile and formic acid . the peptides were resuspended in acetonitrile mm dtt and formic acid . digests used in the ion trap _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ surveys were conducted as for dual isotope labeled quantitation except that of upper phase protein were used and not combined with lower phase digests . samples were loaded onto a mm column home packed with polysulfoethyl scx resin and run using an alliance ht hplc system at in buffer a acetonitrile and formic acid . after loading the following gradient was conducted at buffer b acetonitrile m nacl and formic acid over min followed by buffer b over min and fractions were collected every minute . the organic solvents from each fraction were then removed using vacuum centrifugation and the samples were desalted using solid phase extraction ziptips . samples were eluted using acetonitrile and formic acid and the solvent again was removed using rotary evaporation . samples were then resuspended to in formic acid and acetonitrile and analyzed by lc _METHOD_ fractions were selected for further analysis based on their absorbance at nm during the scx separation . isotopically labeled samples were analyzed on a q tof _METHOD_ spectrometer _METHOD_ coupled to an hp hplc system . analyses were conducted on home pulled fused silica columns packed with eclipse resin . samples were analyzed using reverse phase chromatography at nl/min with buffer a containing formic acid and buffer b containing acetonitrile and formic acid . after loading samples in buffer b the gradient consisted of buffer b over min buffer b over min buffer b over min and buffer b over min . the instrument was operated in data dependent mode with an _METHOD_ scan followed by a s _METHOD_ sequencing attempt for the most intense _METHOD_ peak . ions within da of the sequenced peak were dynamically excluded for s following a sequencing attempt . for survey samples _METHOD_ analysis was performed with an agilent series _METHOD_ ion trap _METHOD_ spectrometer . samples were loaded using an agilent series capillary hplc system onto a reverse phase trap cartridge and washed for min . following the loading the trap column was switched in line with an analytical mm column packed with zorbax reverse phase resin . peptides were eluted from the trap column and further resolved on the analytical column using the following gradient mobile phase b over min mobile phase b over min held at mobile phase b for min mobile phase b over min and then held at mobile phase b for min . mobile phase a consisted of formic acid and mobile phase b consisted of acetonitrile and formic acid . during the gradient an _METHOD_ survey scan was conducted followed by _METHOD_ sequencing of the five most intense peaks with dynamic exclusion for s of sequenced _METHOD_ . the results from each q tof analysis were converted to a peak list using the protein lynx global server program and saved as pkl files that were then searched using mascot . for pkl generation _METHOD_ scans were smoothed twice with a seven point savitzky golay smooth and background subtracted using a fifth degree polynomial with a threshold . the _METHOD_ scans were background subtracted using the _PROTEIN_ algorithm . peaks were centroided using the top of peaks and required a minimum width of four channels and there was no deisotoping . ion trap data were converted to mascot generic files using the agilent _METHOD_ software and default settings . q tof and ion trap data were then searched using mascot from _PROTEIN_ science . mascot cutoff scores for each instrument were determined using a reverse database strategy described previously producing a false positive rate of less than for doubly and triply charged peptides . in brief all protein sequences from the arabidopsis genome were reversed and then attached to the forward database . _METHOD_ data were then searched against the combined forward/reverse database . for a given mascot score and charge state the number of reverse database identifications was used as an estimate of the number of false positives . the ratio of reverse database identifications to forward database identifications provided the _METHOD_ estimate . mascot search parameters for q tof were as follows trypsin as protease one missed cleavage allowed and a tolerance of da for _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ peaks . additionally variable modifications were allowed for amino terminal acetylation of the protein methionine oxidation and _PROTEIN_ terminal labeled lysine and arginine residues . ion trap data were analyzed similarly except that _METHOD_ tolerance was set to da _METHOD_ tolerance was set to da and there was no allowance for labeled residues . for both datasets peptides scoring above the _METHOD_ threshold were considered . the high score for peptides unique to a locus in the genome were summed and all proteins were accepted if they possessed two or more peptides or a single peptide scoring or greater . information _PROTEIN_ all identified peptides was extracted from the mascot search results using perl scripts that utilized the _METHOD_ object oriented tool kit _PROTEIN_ . the raw data from each lc _METHOD_ analysis were dumped to text files using databridge and all further processing was done using mathematica and software _METHOD_ written in c using visual studio and perl . extracted ion _METHOD_ corresponding to the zero one and two incorporation events were extracted min wide centered on the sequencing event . the monoisotopic or double incorporation peak depending on the isotope sequenced was smoothed using a five point savitzky golay smoothing algorithm and fitted to a gaussian peak . data values within two standard deviations of the peak center from the unsmoothed _METHOD_ were then used to calculate linear regressions between the monoisotopic peak and single incorporation peak as well as the monoisotopic peak and double incorporation peak in a method similar to that reported by maccoss et al . . using this method the slope of these regressions represented values for the single and double incorporation peaks that were normalized to the monoisotopic peak where the monoisotopic peak had a value of one . a significant benefit of this strategy is that these values are background subtracted . in addition the correlation coefficient of this strategy provides an estimate of the quality of the fit and can be used as a filter to remove data with poor signal to noise or that have coeluting contaminants . for observations with an value of or greater for both regressions their normalized intensities could then be used to calculate a heavy to light ratio using the equation below that is similar to a method described previously . in this equation and represent the measured intensities for isotopes of the zero one and two heavy oxygen incorporation events respectively . the values _PROTEIN_ and correspond to the calculated isotopic ratio between the monoisotopic peak and the second and fourth isotopes respectively for each peptide based on known natural isotopic abundance using multinomial expansions . on occasion intense ions with large m/z values had multiple isotopes that were smaller than predicted based on natural abundance due to a nonlinear response in the _METHOD_ spectrometer detector . in those infrequent cases where the second isotope was smaller than predicted a correction was performed whereby the single incorporation value was set to zero . if the fourth isotope measurement was also lower than predicted by natural abundance the peptide was not used in further calculations . after successful identifications were quantified ratios were used to calculate an enrichment value for each peptide . peptides that were unique to a given locus in the genome were then used to calculate an isotopic ratio for the protein . proteins with three or more peptides were subjected to dixon s q test prior to the calculations . the _PROTEIN_ web server consensus sequence was used for transmembrane domain predictions . for subcellular localization predictions were downloaded from the arabidopsis information resource website and were based on the ptarget algorithm . predictions for amino terminal myristoylation were also downloaded from the tair website . microarray experiments were queried at the arabidopsis _LOCATION_ protein library website .
