in all land plants cellulose is synthesized from hexameric _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ complexes . indirect evidence suggests that in vascular plants the complexes involved in primary wall synthesis contain three distinct cellulose synthase catalytic subunits _PROTEIN_ . in this study we show that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ are _PROTEIN_ in the same cells and at the same time in the hypocotyl of etiolated seedlings and migrate with comparable velocities along linear trajectories at the cell surface . we also show that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ can be coimmunoprecipitated from detergent solubilized extracts their protein levels _PROTEIN_ in mutants for either _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and also _PROTEIN_ can physically interact in vivo as shown by bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation . we also demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ related _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are partially but not completely redundant with _PROTEIN_ and most likely compete with _PROTEIN_ for the same position in the cellulose synthesis complex . using promoter _PROTEIN_ fusions we show that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have distinct overlapping _PROTEIN_ patterns in hypocotyl and root corresponding to different stages of cellular development . together these data provide evidence for the existence of binding sites for three distinct _PROTEIN_ subunits in primary wall cellulose synthase complexes with two positions being invariably occupied by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ whereas at least three _METHOD_ compete for the third position . participation of the latter three _METHOD_ might fine tune the _PROTEIN_ complexes for the deposition of microfibrils at distinct cellular growth stages .
the existence of two nonredundant isoxaben resistant loci suggested that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are part of the same complex . to investigate this idea we raised isoform specific antibodies against the n terminal predicted cytoplasmic domain of each protein . the antibodies were enriched by using a two step immunopurification procedure and their specificity was shown on immunoblots with the corresponding n terminal fragments of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ produced in escherichia coli . the absence of cross reactivity was also shown in the co ip experiments described below . it is not excluded however that anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies cross reacted with more closely related _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were undetectable in imbibed seeds and appeared after germination . the immunostained bands showed a size of kda which is the predicted molecular _METHOD_ for the _PROTEIN_ proteins . the amount of both proteins increased simultaneously in growing seedlings to reach a maximum at h postimbibition suggesting a coregulation at the protein level in developing seedlings . we next investigated the cellular and subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ from their own promoters in the respective _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant backgrounds . these constructs were biologically functional as shown by the complementation of the short hypocotyl phenotype of the mutants . both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ could be observed in epidermal and cortical cells of day old dark grown hypocotyls . in addition _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed a similar subcellular distribution . both proteins accumulated in similar intracellular compartments and formed rows of _METHOD_ particles at the cell surface as described for yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . among these compartments one could recognize doughnut shaped compartments as described for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and smaller highly motile compartments . time lapse spinning disk microscopy showed bidirectional migration of surface particles for both fusion proteins . the average velocity of the particles in elongating epidermal cells was nm/min and nm/min for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ respectively . these velocities are similar to those reported for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . if distinct _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are present in the same complex one can expect that reducing the protein levels of one isoform will also affect the levels of the other _METHOD_ . to investigate this notion we quantified the relative abundance of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in day old dark grown seedlings in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . _PROTEIN_ is a null allele whereas _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are both leaky alleles . all three mutants show a short hypocotyl and are deficient for cellulose in their primary cell walls . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins accumulated to similar levels either in col or ws backgrounds . as expected in _PROTEIN_ the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody detected only a few percent of the wild type levels . the residual signal may be related to cross reaction with related _PROTEIN_ subunits such as _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . interestingly _PROTEIN_ protein levels were also significantly reduced in this mutant . in a similar way in _PROTEIN_ not only the level of _PROTEIN_ was reduced but also that of _PROTEIN_ . the less severe reduction of _PROTEIN_ compared with _PROTEIN_ in this mutant may be related to the altered properties of the remaining mutant _PROTEIN_ protein . because we did not dispose of specific antibodies for _PROTEIN_ we could not analyze directly the _PROTEIN_ protein levels in the three mutants . however in _PROTEIN_ we observed that levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were also diminished . together these data show that the normal accumulation of each of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins requires the presence of normal levels of both _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which is consistent with the presence of these three proteins in the same complex . to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ physically interact we carried out co ip experiments on detergent solubilized protein extracts from day old dark grown seedlings . as expected anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies precipitated _PROTEIN_ both in nondenaturing and denaturing conditions . interestingly _PROTEIN_ also coimmunoprecipitated with _PROTEIN_ in nondenaturing conditions whereas no _PROTEIN_ signal was observed in denaturing conditions . the latter observation also _METHOD_ the absence of cross reactivity of anti _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ . similar results were obtained with the reciprocal experiment in which anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies were used for the co ip . again _PROTEIN_ precipitated in both nondenaturing and denaturing conditions whereas _PROTEIN_ only coprecipitated in nondenaturing conditions . these results show that a stable interaction existed between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in triton x solubilized extracts and that this interaction was disrupted in denaturing buffer . none of the _PROTEIN_ were immunodetected in the absence of the primary antibody _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . using the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody we observed a second band on the immunoblot . this band may correspond to a truncated _PROTEIN_ isoform or a _PROTEIN_ related isoform . we also investigated the interaction of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with the _LOCATION_ bound cellulase _PROTEIN_ which is also required for normal cellulose synthesis . _PROTEIN_ protein was detected only in the unbound fraction and not in the immunoprecipitates with anti _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ antibodies . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ did not stably interact with _PROTEIN_ nor with _PROTEIN_ in detergent solubilized extracts and underscore the specificity of the observed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction . to confirm the co ip results we studied the capacity of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to interact in vivo by using the bifc technique . the n terminal and the c terminal fragments of _METHOD_ were both fused to the n terminus of the coding sequences of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . as shown in si fig . _METHOD_ fusions at this position do not interfere with the functionality of at least _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . combinations of chimeric genes _PROTEIN_ from the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter were transiently _PROTEIN_ in nicotiana benthamiana leaves using agrobacterium infiltration . as a positive control we used the aquaporin _PROTEIN_ . aquaporins are known to form homotetramers in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . as expected coexpression of yn _PROTEIN_ and yc _PROTEIN_ yielded a _METHOD_ signal whereas no signal was detected by _PROTEIN_ of either yn _PROTEIN_ or yc _PROTEIN_ alone . the _METHOD_ emission spectrum of the signal indeed confirmed that the signal was derived from a functional _METHOD_ . we next investigated whether the fusion proteins derived from the three _PROTEIN_ proteins could homodimerize . as shown in fig ref d and si fig . a _METHOD_ signal was observed for yn _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and yn _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ combinations . _METHOD_ signals were observed both at the cell surface and in intracellular compartments similar to that of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ fused to intact _METHOD_ . for yn _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and yn _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the signal was always weaker suggesting that this protein homodimerizes less efficiently . we also analyzed the yn _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ combination which also reconstituted the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . for all three _PROTEIN_ fusions no _METHOD_ signal was detected by _PROTEIN_ of either yn _PROTEIN_ or yc _PROTEIN_ alone . to investigate whether heterodimers could also be formed we coexpressed yn _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ yn _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ yn _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ yn _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ yn _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or yn _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we observed that _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was reconstituted for all of the combinations suggesting that all three _METHOD_ can form a complex . as a negative control we coexpressed _PROTEIN_ chimerae with corresponding _PROTEIN_ constructs . no signal was detected with combinations of either yn _PROTEIN_ or yc _PROTEIN_ for all of the _PROTEIN_ fusions tested suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins were unable to interact despite the presence of both proteins in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in conclusion all three _METHOD_ showed interactions in vivo confirming the co ip results for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the mild phenotype of _PROTEIN_ null alleles as compared with strong mutant alleles of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ and the lower resistance to isoxaben of _PROTEIN_ mutant than _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ might be caused by partial redundancy with other _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are closely related to _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is only _PROTEIN_ during embryogenesis as shown by public microarray data and promoter _PROTEIN_ fusions and was not considered in this study . we first studied single t dna insertion mutants for _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . mutant light grown seedlings and adult plants were indistinguishable from the wild type . however the dark grown hypocotyl of _PROTEIN_ was slightly shorter than that of the wild type . the analysis of the cell wall of dark grown mutant hypocotyls with _PROTEIN_ microspectroscopy failed to detect differences with the wild type as shown by the tight clustering of the mutants with wild type controls . the _PROTEIN_ spectra of double _PROTEIN_ mutants also clustered with those of the wild type . interestingly compared with the single _PROTEIN_ mutant the dark grown hypocotyl of the double mutant was slightly longer . in addition roots of light grown _PROTEIN_ seedlings were slightly longer and adult plants were slightly larger than the wild type . in contrast mutant combinations with _PROTEIN_ showed a very different picture . _PROTEIN_ double mutants showed an enhanced phenotype compared with _PROTEIN_ as shown by the reduced hypocotyl length in the dark the reduced root length in the light and the strongly dwarfed and bushy adult _PROTEIN_ plants . _PROTEIN_ double homozygotes were seedling lethal . interestingly the _PROTEIN_ allele showed a strong dosage effect in a homozygous _PROTEIN_ background as shown by the segregation of the dark grown hypocotyl into three size classes within the population of a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ heterozygote . to construct the triple mutant we crossed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . among the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings only the _PROTEIN_ / seedlings were viable . the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ seedlings either bleached and died or survived as very small sterile plants . hypocotyl lengths of day old dark grown seedlings we next investigated whether the lower isoxaben resistance of _PROTEIN_ compared with _PROTEIN_ was caused by the presence of _PROTEIN_ related proteins in the cellulose synthase complexes of _PROTEIN_ plants . to this end we quantified the resistance to isoxaben of all double and triple mutant combinations of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ by measuring the hypocotyl length of day old dark grown seedlings on increasing concentrations of isoxaben . as observed previously _PROTEIN_ was fold more resistant to isoxaben than the wild type and _PROTEIN_ was fold more resistant than _PROTEIN_ . interestingly adding _PROTEIN_ increased the resistance of _PROTEIN_ to that of _PROTEIN_ adding _PROTEIN_ caused a > fold increase in resistance and adding both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ rendered the seedling insensitive to nm isoxaben . the increased resistance was not caused by increased _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ protein levels in the mutants . together these data show that all three _PROTEIN_ related _METHOD_ are targets for isoxaben suggesting that they compete for the same binding site within the cellulose synthase complex . using promoter gus fusions we studied the _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes in dark grown hypocotyls and roots of h old seedlings . at this stage different phases of cell expansion are represented from the top to the base of the hypocotyl or from the tip to the base of the root . promoter _PROTEIN_ gus was weakly _PROTEIN_ only in the unexpanded cells in the apical hook of the hypocotyl . promoter _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ occurred throughout the hypocotyl and root peaking in the growth acceleration zone just below the apical hook and in the cell elongation zone in the root . promoter _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ largely overlapped with that of promoter _PROTEIN_ gus but in the root peaked in more mature cells . the gus _PROTEIN_ patterns in the root were consistent with the microarray data for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ on flow sorted root protoplasts . in conclusion the three partially redundant _PROTEIN_ genes mark distinct cellular growth stages in hypocotyl and root . we showed that _PROTEIN_ is partially redundant with _PROTEIN_ and most likely competes for the same site in the complex . the incomplete redundancy can be caused by the partially overlapping _PROTEIN_ patterns or intrinsic differences in the protein structure and function . to investigate this we _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ from the _PROTEIN_ promoter in a _PROTEIN_ null background . three independent transformants showed incomplete restoration of the hypocotyl growth defect . on the contrary _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ from the same promoter sequence completely restored the wild type phenotype to _PROTEIN_ . the results show that _PROTEIN_ can not entirely substitute for _PROTEIN_ suggesting that both _METHOD_ have specialized roles in the deposition of cellulose in expanding cells .
