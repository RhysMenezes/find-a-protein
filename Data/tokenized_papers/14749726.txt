here we report on a pathway in plants that is downstream of phosphatidic acid and involves the arabidopsis protein kinase _PROTEIN_ regulated by the _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ specifically interacts with _PROTEIN_ through a conserved hydrophobic motif that leads to its phosphorylation and activation whereas inhibition of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by rna interference abolishes _PROTEIN_ activity . phosphatidic acid specifically binds to _PROTEIN_ and stimulates _PROTEIN_ in an _PROTEIN_ manner . _PROTEIN_ is ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ in all plant tissues whereas _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is abundant in organs and dividing cells and activated during of cells into the cell cycle after sugar _PROTEIN_ arrest . plant hormones auxin and cytokinin synergistically activate the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ kinase indicative of a role in growth and cell division . cellular localisation of _METHOD_ fusion protein is highly dynamic in root hairs and at some stages confined to root hair tips and to _LOCATION_ . the _PROTEIN_ knockout mutation results in a reduction of root hair length suggesting a role for _PROTEIN_ in root hair growth and development .
to search for potential components of the _PROTEIN_ signalling pathway a yeast screen was carried out using _PROTEIN_ as bait and a prey cdna library prepared from cultured arabidopsis cells . by screening transformed yeast colonies cdna clones encoding _PROTEIN_ interacting _PROTEIN_ were identified which were sorted into groups . two of these prey cdnas encoded ser/thr protein kinases _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ that carried conserved domains of the _PROTEIN_ kinase family which is represented in arabidopsis by members . in a recent review we follow a nomenclature for the _PROTEIN_ kinase family in arabidopsis that provides working names for all members but incorporate and keep published names wherever available . there are two closely related _PROTEIN_ genes in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ sharing identities . _PROTEIN_ is identical to the originally named _PROTEIN_ the name we use within this paper . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ share sequence identity and show a significant similarity to mouse pka over the entire coding region . arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and its analogue _PROTEIN_ interacted with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in yeast assays . _PROTEIN_ appeared to recognise the _PROTEIN_ kinase domain as no interaction could be detected with the ph domain of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ binding to selected _PROTEIN_ kinases in animals such as to pkb apkc or to sgk has been shown to require a hydrophobic fxxf motif called _PROTEIN_ interacting fragment _PROTEIN_ . we generated two modified kinase constructs by exchanging the two conserved phenylalanines to alanine within the fxxf motif or replacing the last six amino acids with an unrelated sequence rgsgc . both mutated versions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were unable to interact with _PROTEIN_ . these data support the finding that both phenylalanines in the _PROTEIN_ interacting fragment _PROTEIN_ domain are required for interaction . to determine the enzymatic activity and substrate specificities of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ kinases we performed in vitro kinase assays with different synthetic peptides known to be phosphorylated by animal _PROTEIN_ kinases . both arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ kinases were labelled with haemagglutinin epitope tags _PROTEIN_ in transfected arabidopsis cells and immunopurified for kinase assays day after transfection using immobilised monoclonal igg . the kemptide peptide which is readily phosphorylated by animal pka was found to be the best substrate for both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which showed no significant difference in their substrate preference in these assays . to further characterise the substrate specificity of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we have used a kinase inhibitor peptide derived from the pka inhibitor protein pki which binds to the catalytic pocket of animal pka . the pki peptide inhibited similarly the phosphorylation activities of and kinases with all substrate peptides tested . these results demonstrate that the substrate preferences of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ resemble those of mammalian pka enzymes . next we investigated whether interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ requires its hydrophobic _PROTEIN_ domain in vivo and how this interaction affects the enzyme activity of _PROTEIN_ . for this we cotransfected a _PROTEIN_ kinase with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ into protoplasts prepared from cultured arabidopsis cells and tested for the presence of in _PROTEIN_ experiments as compared to the input amounts in crude extracts . protein kinase activity of _PROTEIN_ was determined using the kemptide peptide . these experiments confirmed that is recruited by _PROTEIN_ in vivo . to answer the question whether the activity of _PROTEIN_ kinase is required for interaction with _PROTEIN_ we performed similar _PROTEIN_ assays using a modified kinase _PROTEIN_ . this inactivated kinase in which a critical lysine residue required for phosphotransfer was changed to arginine showed no change in its ability to interact with _PROTEIN_ . to test whether the conserved _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation site on _PROTEIN_ at within the activation loop is critical for _PROTEIN_ activity or its interaction with _PROTEIN_ we exchanged this serine residue to alanine . while the activity of the mutated _PROTEIN_ was reduced to background levels the phosphorylation site mutation had no effect on the _PROTEIN_ interaction with _PROTEIN_ . these data showed that phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ within the activation loop possibly by _PROTEIN_ is critical for its activity but not required for _PROTEIN_ interaction . contrary to this a reduction in interaction was detected when the critical phenylalanine residues within the _PROTEIN_ domain were mutated or when the domain was exchanged as indicated in fig ref . these mutant _METHOD_ were also found to be inactive in kinase assays with kemptide as a substrate . these results indicated that either the association of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ is required for its activity or that the mutations within the _PROTEIN_ domain inactivated the kinase as was previously found for pka . interestingly deletion of the hydrophobic motif in _PROTEIN_ a representative of _PROTEIN_ kinase subgroup in arabidopsis was observed to yield no change in its biological activity . nonetheless our results clearly showed that the hydrophobic region of _PROTEIN_ is important for interaction with _PROTEIN_ and that phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ at the activation site possibly by _PROTEIN_ is required for its activity but not for its binding to _PROTEIN_ . to address the question whether _PROTEIN_ mediates the activation of either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ the activity of _PROTEIN_ kinases was monitored in cells in which the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ gene was inhibited using rnai technology . the _PROTEIN_ construct was designed using the inverted approach . the efficiency of rnai gene silencing was measured with the help of a cotransfected _PROTEIN_ construct the sequence of which was nearly identical to the endogenously _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mrna . the _PROTEIN_ level of reporter construct thus reflected the inhibition of endogeneous _PROTEIN_ gene . the _PROTEIN_ construct reduced the _PROTEIN_ of cotransfected reporter to a nondetectable level . this ablation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ did not affect the activity of but reduced the kinase activity of kinase to a background level which was comparable to the control where no kinase was transfected into the cells . the _PROTEIN_ levels of and proteins were however not affected by cotransfection of the rnai construct as was revealed by immunoblotting with an antibody . these results showed that the presence of _PROTEIN_ was required for activation of _PROTEIN_ whereas _PROTEIN_ levels had no affect on _PROTEIN_ activity in dividing arabidopsis cells . next we investigated whether _PROTEIN_ could phosphorylate directly the _PROTEIN_ kinases in vitro . purified _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ were incubated with or without the purified _PROTEIN_ in a protein kinase assay . while _PROTEIN_ showed autophosphorylation in the absence of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was only phosphorylated when coincubated with _PROTEIN_ suggesting an absolute requirement for _PROTEIN_ as upstream activating kinase . we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments to detect the interaction of endogenous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in vivo in arabidopsis cells . we have raised antibodies against the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins . these and antibodies specifically reacted with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins respectively in western blot analyses using cell lysates prepared from cultured arabidopsis cells . to detect in vivo association of these protein kinases _PROTEIN_ was immunoprecipitated from arabidopsis protein extracts using an immobilised polyclonal igg and then the isolated immunocomplex was probed by western blotting with an antibody raised against _PROTEIN_ . a specific band corresponding to _PROTEIN_ was detected in the _PROTEIN_ immunocomplex which was not present with preimmune serum or with the igg beads alone . this confirmed in vivo the interaction of endogenous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins and is in agreement with the results that we obtained with the yeast assay and with the _PROTEIN_ experiments . we have previously observed that the ph domain of _PROTEIN_ directly binds _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . to compare binding of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ we have used _PROTEIN_ which were prepared by covalent linkage of these lipids to affigel beads . as shown in fig ref the _PROTEIN_ beads retained considerably more _PROTEIN_ than the _PROTEIN_ beads . the specificity of this assay was confirmed using control domains of known specificity . these included the two _PROTEIN_ domains phox domain of human protein and a double _PROTEIN_ domain from mouse hrs and _PROTEIN_ which is the _PROTEIN_ region of kinase . the _PROTEIN_ and phox domains were retained on the _PROTEIN_ beads whereas the domain specifically bound to _PROTEIN_ consequently these results indicated that _PROTEIN_ preferentially binds _PROTEIN_ next we tested whether external addition of various lipids to arabidopsis cells resulted in altered _PROTEIN_ activity . first we had to establish a protein kinase assay for _PROTEIN_ . we found that _PROTEIN_ was able to phosphorylate directly a synthetic peptide whose sequence encompasses the _PROTEIN_ site fused to the _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation site on the activation loop of the animal pkb termed _PROTEIN_ . as shown in fig ref the exogenously applied _PROTEIN_ very rapidly increased the _PROTEIN_ activity . other negatively charged phospholipids such as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were not able to stimulate the activity of _PROTEIN_ with the exception of _PROTEIN_ . these results showed that increased _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in cells are able to stimulate _PROTEIN_ activity . whether this indicates a possible recruitment of _PROTEIN_ to _LOCATION_ or other lipid compartments however remains to be established . next we tested whether the external addition of lipids to arabidopsis cells could alter the activity of _PROTEIN_ kinases in an _PROTEIN_ manner which would indicate that phospholipid signalling is upstream of these kinases in vivo . as shown in fig ref only _PROTEIN_ increased the activity of _PROTEIN_ whereas none of the lipids tested could alter the activity of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ activation of _PROTEIN_ was transient showing an increase as early as min . the peak level of _PROTEIN_ activity occurring min after stimulation was approximately higher than the basal activity measured in untreated dividing cells . when the cells were transfected with the _PROTEIN_ construct not only was the _PROTEIN_ activation abolished but the rnai inhibition also resulted in a dramatic drop in basal activity which decayed to background level throughout the time course . these data showed that both the basal activity attained in cells cultured in medium and the _PROTEIN_ induction specifically required the presence of _PROTEIN_ . in animal cells _PROTEIN_ signalling is produced either by the phospholipase c pathway in combination with diacylglycerol kinase or directly via phospholipase d _PROTEIN_ . the latter pathway can specifically be inhibited by because _PROTEIN_ preferentially uses it as a substrate resulting in the production of phosphatidyl butanol at the cost of _PROTEIN_ . therefore is widely used as a _PROTEIN_ inhibitor in plant and animal _METHOD_ . in our assays treatment resulted only in a slight _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ activity . some significance of this finding was suggested by the _PROTEIN_ that a closely related compound which is not a substrate for _PROTEIN_ 's transphosphatidylation activity had no effect on the activity of _PROTEIN_ . to modify endogenous _PROTEIN_ levels and to assay whether _PROTEIN_ binding to the ph domain of _PROTEIN_ can regulate the activity of _PROTEIN_ we tested whether we could titrate out the endogenous _PROTEIN_ levels by overexpression of two _PROTEIN_ domains fused to _METHOD_ the ph domain of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the putative _PROTEIN_ domain of attor _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis cells . as shown in fig ref the activity of _PROTEIN_ kinase was reduced by about h after the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . following h the _PROTEIN_ activity was however reduced only to of control suggesting the induction of a compensatory mechanism . overexpression of another _PROTEIN_ domain derived from the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ kinase also reduced _PROTEIN_ activity but only by . mastoporan is a known activator of heterotrimeric and triggers _PROTEIN_ signalling via plc and _PROTEIN_ activation . this raised the question whether mastoporan treatment could activate _PROTEIN_ ? we found a rapid and transient activation of _PROTEIN_ upon treatment that was dose and time dependent . no activation was observed with an inactive mastoporan analogue . these data suggested that a receptor might operate upstream of _PROTEIN_ . taken together these results strongly suggested that phosphatidic acid is involved in the activation of a signalling pathway upstream of _PROTEIN_ leading to subsequent _PROTEIN_ activation of _PROTEIN_ . agonists that activate _PROTEIN_ signalling pathways include growth _PROTEIN_ and hormones in animal cells . therefore we have tested the ability of plant growth _PROTEIN_ auxin and cytokinin to act as possible activators of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ by transfection in arabidopsis cells and day _PROTEIN_ the cells were treated with auxin and cytokinin . cells were harvested at different time intervals and the activity of _PROTEIN_ was determined after immunopurification with igg in kinase assays in vitro . when used separately both auxin and cytokinin activated approximately min after hormone application leading to an activity peak about h _PROTEIN_ . when auxin and cytokinin were added together a synergistic stimulation of was observed . the viability of cells h after hormone starvation was confirmed by the inducibility of promoters . to assess the tissue distribution of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrna _PROTEIN_ northern blot analyses were performed . the _PROTEIN_ transcript was detected in all organs examined . in contrast levels of _PROTEIN_ mrna were maximal in roots and cultured cells but low in nongrowing fully developed leaves . this _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ resembled that of cyclin _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ . to examine this in more detail we studied the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ gene in synchronised arabidopsis cells . when sugar is withdrawn from the medium a high proportion of cultured arabidopsis cells is arrested in _PROTEIN_ phase but cell cycle synchronously when sugar is added back . as shown in fig ref sugar starvation in our experiments led to a dramatic _PROTEIN_ in the proportion of cells in s phase but the number of cells in s phase increased again from h onwards after with sugar . in these synchronised cells _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ evenly in all samples . however _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was strongly induced when sugar was added back to the medium showing a peak after h just before the cells entered s phase . this correlation indicated that pathways controlling cell growth and to the cell cycle tightly regulate the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . to dissect the function of _PROTEIN_ genetically we have identified a knockout mutation . a single insertion was located in the first intron and resulted in full inactivation of the _PROTEIN_ gene . for phenotypic characterisation of the _PROTEIN_ mutant we first focused our attention on the analysis of root development as in plants _PROTEIN_ showed a high level of _PROTEIN_ in this organ . to ascertain the comparable physiological condition of growing roots we scored the root and root hair phenotypes in a segregating population of seedlings which was characterised for the status of homozygosity for the insertion in the _PROTEIN_ gene using pcr . in general the mutant roots resembled roots and their apical growth rate was also similar to that of the wild type . however the length of mature root hairs in the _PROTEIN_ mutant was only in comparison to the wild type . both the root hair phenotype and the hygromycin resistance showed a segregation confirming that the insert and the phenotype are genetically linked . to obtain a tool for further study of _PROTEIN_ function in root hair development we have _PROTEIN_ a _METHOD_ green _METHOD_ reporter protein in plants and examined its subcellular localisation . although these proteins were _PROTEIN_ by the promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus rna the pattern of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ showed an interesting deviation from a control _METHOD_ construct driven by the same promoter . the _METHOD_ protein displayed an apparent accumulation in cells of meristematic zones of primary roots . in root hairs the localisation of _METHOD_ reporter protein showed a highly dynamic pattern that characteristically changed during development . in immature root hairs _METHOD_ was localised on the internal surface of root hairs in association with structures . _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ signal appeared at the root hair tips and during root hair growth accumulated around the root hair apex . in fully elongated hairs _METHOD_ also appeared in _LOCATION_ positioned at the base of hairs indicating a developmentally regulated subcellular translocation .
