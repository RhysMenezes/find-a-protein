anisotropic plant cell growth depends on the coordination between the orientation of cortical microtubules and the orientation of nascent cellulose microfibrils . cellulose synthase _PROTEIN_ is a key scaffold protein that guides primary cellulose synthase complexes along cortical microtubules during cellulose biosynthesis . here we investigated the function of the _PROTEIN_ like protein in arabidopsis thaliana . similar to _PROTEIN_ associates with primary cscs in vitro colocalizes with cscs in vivo and exhibits the same _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization and bidirectional motility as _PROTEIN_ . however _METHOD_ can not complement the anisotropic cell growth defect in _PROTEIN_ mutants suggesting that is not functionally equivalent to _PROTEIN_ . also the colocalization ratio between _PROTEIN_ and is low which may suggest heterogeneity within the csc population . _PROTEIN_ double mutants showed an enhanced cell expansion defect as well as an additive reduction of csc velocities and dynamics are dependent on _PROTEIN_ function . we propose that is an important regulator of plant cellulose biosynthesis and plant anisotropic cell growth that modulates the velocity of cscs in both a microtubule dependent and microtubule independent manner .
the arabidopsis genome contains two _PROTEIN_ homologs referred to as and . _PROTEIN_ shares and amino acid similarity with and respectively . and each have at least six predicted armadillo repeats and a single _PROTEIN_ domain . transcriptional analysis obtained from genevestigator indicates that like _PROTEIN_ is widely _PROTEIN_ in many tissues whereas _PROTEIN_ is limited to male reproductive tissues including the stamen and pollen . to obtain detailed _PROTEIN_ profiles of and a kb promoter of or was fused to the _PROTEIN_ gene and a histochemical analysis of gus activity was performed . gus _PROTEIN_ was detected in many of the same tissues as _PROTEIN_ including dark grown hypocotyls stamen pollen developing siliques and roots . however the _PROTEIN_ of was not identical to that of _PROTEIN_ . in rosette leaves was _PROTEIN_ in the vasculature and in the trichomes whereas _PROTEIN_ was not _PROTEIN_ in these tissues . in addition the _PROTEIN_ of was more restricted in meristematic tissue of the shoot and root . gus activity for gus was not detected in any of the tissues examined including rosette leaves d old light grown whole seedlings d old dark grown seedlings flowers siliques stamen and pollen . this evidence suggests that is a pseudogene or that the _PROTEIN_ of is below the detection limit of the histochemical assay . to investigate the biological function of we analyzed t dna insertion lines of . was determined to be a null allele since a t dna was inserted in its third exon and no mrna was detected by rt pcr . unlike _PROTEIN_ mutants had no visible defects in expansion . dark grown hypocotyls light grown seedlings and mature plants of were indistinguishable from the wild type . to test for genetic interaction between _PROTEIN_ and a _PROTEIN_ double mutant line was generated by crossing _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ etiolated hypocotyls displayed severe cell swelling and growth retardation compared with the single mutant parental lines . dark grown hypocotyls of _PROTEIN_ were shorter than _PROTEIN_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ and synergistically regulate hypocotyl elongation . the number of epidermal cells in hypocotyls of _PROTEIN_ did not differ significantly from that of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . more importantly _PROTEIN_ exacerbated the anisotropic growth defect of _PROTEIN_ hypocotyls as illustrated by an increase in cell diameter . the reduced hypocotyl length and increased hypocotyl diameter of _PROTEIN_ mutants indicate that is a regulator of anisotropic growth . to investigate whether has a role in the guidance of cscs along cortical microtubules we compared the association of cscs with microtubules in wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines . using a transgenic line coexpressing the csc marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and the microtubule marker mcherry _PROTEIN_ cscs were visualized moving through the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ along linear tracks provided by the underlying microtubules in wild type dark grown hypocotyls . quantification of the association between cscs and microtubules revealed that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ colocalized with microtubules extensively in the wild type line . the coalignment of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and microtubules was disrupted in the _PROTEIN_ mutants . unlike _PROTEIN_ did not affect the colocalization ratio of cscs with microtubules . moreover the colocalization ratio of cscs with microtubules in _PROTEIN_ was not significantly different from that of _PROTEIN_ suggesting that unlike _PROTEIN_ is not crucial for the coalignment of cscs and microtubules . to test whether has a role in cellulose biosynthesis we examined the velocity of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labeled cscs in . similar to in the wild type background time averaged projections of frames from a min time series in displayed linear trajectories along microtubules . the velocity of cscs was quantified by measuring the slopes of linear traces in kymographs . the velocity of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in was not significantly different from that of control cells . by contrast the velocity of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants was reduced . the mean velocity of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ was nm/min compared with nm/min in control seedlings . loss of both _PROTEIN_ and further reduced the velocity of cscs to nm/min in _PROTEIN_ a reduction of from the average velocity in _PROTEIN_ mutants suggesting that is required for _PROTEIN_ the velocity of cscs in _PROTEIN_ mutants . crystalline cellulose analysis using the updegraff method suggested that the cellulose content in etiolated hypocotyls of _PROTEIN_ was further reduced than in _PROTEIN_ . these observations are consistent with the enhanced anisotropic growth defects in _PROTEIN_ seedlings . to examine the subcellular localization of we created an n terminal green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion construct using full length cdna of driven by a kb native promoter of . to test the reliability of this variant the resulting _METHOD_ construct was transformed into the _PROTEIN_ double mutant . since lacked a measureable phenotype complementation analysis was performed on the double mutant . _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ in dark grown seedlings _PROTEIN_ complemented the mutation and resulted in seedlings with a _PROTEIN_ morphology indicating that _METHOD_ fusion proteins are functional in plants . similar to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was detected as distinct particles at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of epidermal cells of dark grown hypocotyls and was not detected at intracellular _LOCATION_ associated compartments . to analyze the relationship between _PROTEIN_ and we crossed a _METHOD_ line with red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and observed epidermal cells of d old dark grown hypocotyls via two channel confocal imaging . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ particles moved along linear tracks as shown by time averaged projections of frames from a min time series of images . the linear tracks traveled by _METHOD_ coincided with those of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ as shown by the merged image . both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ particles traveled bidirectionally as shown by cross hatching traces in the kymographs . the average velocity of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ particles was similar to that of _METHOD_ particles traveling at nm/min and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ traveling at nm/min in the same cells . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ particles partially overlapped at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in a single optical section of _METHOD_ particles were colocalized with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ which was not significantly higher than the random colocalization . similarly of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ particles were colocalized with _METHOD_ which was just slightly higher than the random colocalization . these results suggest that the colocalization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ is not widespread at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . given that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ each travel bidirectionally with similar constant velocities along overlapping tracks the limited colocalization between _PROTEIN_ and could result either from _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ particles traveling in opposite directions or from _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ traveling in the same direction while _PROTEIN_ different positions along the same track . to decipher the relationship between _PROTEIN_ and we examined the temporal dynamic behavior of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ particles . in of observed cases _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ particles moved in opposite directions overlapping briefly before parting and continuing to move in opposite directions . furthermore we observed prolonged associations between _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ particles that were moving in the same direction in which colocalized particles traveled together for at least min before splitting into distinct particles . however in the majority of cases in which _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ particles moved in the same direction one particle lagged behind the other . these observations suggest that the limited colocalization between _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ may represent particles that _PROTEIN_ distinct roles while temporarily overlapping without functional association . _PROTEIN_ interacts with the primary _PROTEIN_ including _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in a conventional yeast two hybrid assay . to test for direct interaction between and the full length _PROTEIN_ we performed a split ubiquitin yeast two hybrid assay which can analyze protein protein interactions of integral _LOCATION_ proteins . full length _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ sequences were fused to the c terminal half of ubiquitin and were able to reconstitute a functional ubiquitin when cotransformed with the wild type n terminal half of ubiquitin which was used as a positive control but not when cotransformed with a mutated form of nub which was used as a negative control . as an additional negative control no reporter gene _PROTEIN_ was detected when either _PROTEIN_ nubg or nubg were cotransformed with cub alone . when either _PROTEIN_ or was fused to nubg and cotransformed into yeast with _PROTEIN_ cub or _PROTEIN_ cub reporter gene _PROTEIN_ was detected suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and interact with full length _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the split ubiquitin yeast two hybrid assay . to examine whether associates with cscs in vivo we generated a line carrying both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . two channel confocal imaging revealed that the _METHOD_ signal extensively overlapped with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the colocalization quantification showed that of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ particles colocalized with _METHOD_ particles similar to what has been observed for the colocalization ratio between _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . these results suggest that both _PROTEIN_ and associate with the primary cscs at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in addition to associating with _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ also labels small _PROTEIN_ containing compartments or microtubule associated cellulose synthase compartments . after dark grown hypocotyls were treated with nm isoxaben for h _METHOD_ also accumulated in a subset of smaccs/mascs that were colabeled with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ containing smaccs/mascs moved with a variable speed from to nm/min which is consistent with the dynamics of smaccs/mascs . _METHOD_ punctae moved simultaneously with smaccs/mascs that were colabeled with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ punctae appeared in the same focal plane as _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and showed typical _LOCATION_ motility with rapid and short dislocations . the colocalization ratio of smaccs/mascs colabeled with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ was smaller than that of smaccs/mascs colabeled with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ suggesting that associates with a subset of smaccs/mascs . to investigate whether the _PROTEIN_ and containing smacc/masc populations overlap a colocalization analysis was performed between _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ . the colocalization ratio of the isoxaben induced smaccs/mascs colabeled with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ was similar to the colocalization ratio between _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ particles in the absence of isoxaben . to determine whether there was a functional relationship between _PROTEIN_ and in colabeled smaccs/mascs the temporal behavior of _PROTEIN_ and containing smaccs/mascs was analyzed . multiple distinct _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ isoxaben induced smacc/masc particles merged into a single smacc/masc particle with overlapping _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ signal . this colabeled smacc/masc particle was stable for s before splitting into two separate _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labeled particles that were distinct from the _METHOD_ labeled particle that remained stable and stationary . similar to the relationship observed between overlapping _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized _PROTEIN_ and particles the temporal behavior of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ colabeled smaccs/mascs suggests that _PROTEIN_ and mark two distinct smacc/masc populations . together these results indicate that heterogeneity may exist within csc populations and within smacc/masc populations . _PROTEIN_ is the scaffold between cscs and cortical microtubules . considering the similarity between _PROTEIN_ and the spatial relationship between and microtubules was examined . two channel confocal imaging of a line carrying both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ revealed that moved in a linear track along underlying cortical microtubules . in a single optical section around of _METHOD_ particles coaligned with microtubules . to further examine the spatial relationship between _PROTEIN_ and microtubules we generated a line carrying cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ . three channel confocal imaging revealed that the percentage of coincidence between _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and microtubules is similar to that of between _METHOD_ and microtubules . these observations suggest that similar to _PROTEIN_ particles travel along the underlying microtubules . to further investigate the function of we generated a construct in which cdna was fused with _METHOD_ under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter _METHOD_ . the _METHOD_ construct was transformed into _PROTEIN_ . homozygous transgenic lines were selected and analyzed for dark grown growth morphology . _METHOD_ was not able to rescue the short and swollen hypocotyl phenotype of _PROTEIN_ . to assess whether _METHOD_ is able to associate with cscs at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ two individual lines of in _PROTEIN_ were examined using spinning disk confocal microscopy . particles were localized at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in a pattern indistinguishable from _METHOD_ particles driven by the native promoter . particles moved bidirectionally and formed linear trajectories suggesting that particles were functionally associated with cscs . however since was not able to complement the mutant phenotype of _PROTEIN_ is not functionally equivalent to _PROTEIN_ . to test whether the function of is dependent on _PROTEIN_ we examined the distribution and dynamics of _METHOD_ particles in the _METHOD_ complemented _PROTEIN_ mutant background . in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ particles were localized at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and formed short and dense trajectories in the time averaged images . the average velocity of _METHOD_ had more than a reduction when _PROTEIN_ was absent . the mean velocity of _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ was similar to that of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is required for normal motility of associated cscs . the velocity reduction of in _PROTEIN_ is comparable to that of in _PROTEIN_ further supporting the notion that _PROTEIN_ is required for associated cscs .
