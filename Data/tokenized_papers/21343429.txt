loss of function mutations in the arabidopsis enhanced disease _PROTEIN_ gene confer enhanced resistance to powdery mildew infection enhanced senescence and enhanced programmed cell death under both abiotic and biotic stress conditions . all _PROTEIN_ mediated phenotypes can be suppressed by a specific missense mutation in the keep on going _PROTEIN_ gene which encodes a multidomain protein that includes a _PROTEIN_ ligase domain a kinase domain ankyrin repeats and like repeats . the molecular and cellular _METHOD_ underlying this suppression are poorly understood . using confocal laser scanning microscopy and _METHOD_ protein fusions we determined that _PROTEIN_ localizes to trans _LOCATION_ network/early endosome vesicles . both the keg mutation which is located in the _PROTEIN_ terminal like repeats and deletion of the entire like repeats reduced endosomal localization of _PROTEIN_ and increased localization to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ indicating that the like repeats facilitate the tgn/ee targeting of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ colocalized with _PROTEIN_ to the tgn/ee when coexpressed but localized primarily to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ when _PROTEIN_ alone . yeast two hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation analyses revealed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ physically interact . deletion of the like repeats abolished the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as well as the _PROTEIN_ induced tgn/ee localization of _PROTEIN_ indicating that the recruitment of _PROTEIN_ to the tgn/ee is based on a direct interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mediated by the like repeats . collectively these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function together to regulate endocytic trafficking and/or the formation of signaling complexes on tgn/ee vesicles during stress responses .
to determine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ super yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ was fused to the c terminus of the full length _PROTEIN_ open reading frame . we showed that this fusion protein was functional by placing this construct under control of the native _PROTEIN_ promoter and transforming heterozygous keg mutant plants . phenotypically wild type plants that were homozygous for the keg insertion were recovered in the generation indicating that the transgene complemented the keg mutation . this was confirmed in the generation . analysis of transgenic plants by confocal laser scanning microscopy however failed to detect a _METHOD_ signal indicating that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ at very low levels under normal conditions . to enable detection of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein we placed the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct under control of a steroid inducible promoter and transiently transformed it into nicotiana benthamiana leaves using agrobacterium tumefaciens infiltration . twenty four hours after treatment with dexamethasone epidermal cells were examined using confocal laser scanning microscopy . in all transformed cells small _METHOD_ punctate structures were observed in the cortex of cells . in time lapse imaging these vesicles alternated between random saltatory and directional movements similar to the previously described movements of _LOCATION_ stacks . to avoid possible mislocalization of _PROTEIN_ caused by the c terminal fusion with _METHOD_ we also constructed a _PROTEIN_ n terminal fusion with mcherry and a similar localization pattern was observed . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and mcherry _PROTEIN_ completely overlapped with each other upon coexpression suggesting that the _METHOD_ protein fusions did not impact the localization of _PROTEIN_ . since the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ pattern resembled both the distribution and movement pattern of _LOCATION_ stacks we performed colocalization experiments with the cis _LOCATION_ cisternae marker fused with mcherry and with the trans _LOCATION_ cisternae marker sialyltransferase _PROTEIN_ fused with red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . surprisingly in both cases very little overlap was detected . instead _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ typically localized adjacent to _LOCATION_ stacks revealing a twin spot distribution pattern with _LOCATION_ stacks . time lapse live imaging revealed that not all _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ containing vesicles associated with _LOCATION_ stacks . instead association with _LOCATION_ stacks appeared to be transient in nature . we also performed analyses in arabidopsis protoplasts using a native promoter driven _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct . the same localization pattern was observed as in n. benthamiana although at a much lower level indicating that the localization pattern is not an artifact of heterologous _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana . the localization pattern of _PROTEIN_ relative to _LOCATION_ stacks is similar to what has been previously reported for the tgn/ee . therefore we coexpressed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with the tgn/ee marker protein _PROTEIN_ fused with mcherry at the n terminus . as a control we also coexpressed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with mcherry _PROTEIN_ which localizes to the prevacuolar compartment/late endosomes . upon coexpression the _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ colocalized with mcherry _PROTEIN_ as shown in figure j to l and their movement during time lapse imaging was synchronous . in contrast _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ conferred a distinct localization and movement pattern from mcherry _PROTEIN_ . furthermore the movement of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ depended on the actin _LOCATION_ as treatment with latrunculin b an actin disrupting drug blocked its directional movements . we thus conclude that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localizes to tgn/ee vesicles . in plants the tgn can not be distinguished from ee hence the dual name . based on work in animal and yeast _METHOD_ the tgn is generally considered to play a role in sorting of newly synthesized proteins to the _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ while ees are formed by endocytosis of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . it appears though that in plant cells ees rapidly fuse with tgn vesicles thus _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ associated proteins can enter tgn/ee vesicles from both the _LOCATION_ mediated secretory pathway and the endocytic pathway . furthermore specific _METHOD_ of _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ that are localized to the tgn/ee are required for the proper function of both the endocytic and secretory pathways indicating that the tgn/ee functions as a junction between these two pathways . ubiquitination plays an important role in controlling endocytosis and biogenesis of the endomembrane system in plants . because _PROTEIN_ is an ubiquitin ligase and is localized to the endomembrane system we tested whether loss of _PROTEIN_ affected general endocytic trafficking pathways . to this end the endocytic tracer dye was used to track the general endocytosis process from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to the central _LOCATION_ in root cells of both columbia wild type and keg t dna insertion knockout lines . as shown in figure root cells of keg mutants showed normal _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ staining immediately after treatment . no differences in staining between keg and wild type cells were observed at min following application by which time tgn/ee vesicles were visible at min or at h _LOCATION_ . the keg mutant did not show any obvious morphological alterations in any endomembrane structures stained by . taken together these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ does not control general endocytic trafficking routes from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to the central _LOCATION_ or the biogenesis of endomembrane vesicles . as described above the keg mutation which is located in the like repeat domain suppresses the enhanced programmed cell death phenotype of _PROTEIN_ mutant arabidopsis . the finding that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is primarily localized to the tgn/ee suggested that the enhanced programmed cell death phenotype of _PROTEIN_ mutants may be related to endomembrane trafficking . defects in endomembrane trafficking have previously been associated with triggering cell death in other _METHOD_ . therefore we tested whether the _PROTEIN_ mutation affected the localization of _PROTEIN_ . for this purpose _PROTEIN_ mutant protoplasts were transfected with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and mcherry and their colocalization pattern was monitored . no change in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization was observed in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background compared with wild type protoplasts indicating that loss of _PROTEIN_ does not disrupt the localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or the formation of _PROTEIN_ containing vesicles . to investigate whether the keg mutation altered the normal subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ we generated a keg _METHOD_ fusion and transiently _PROTEIN_ it in n. benthamiana . the vesicular signal of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was reduced by the keg mutation whereas an increase in _METHOD_ signal was detected in both the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . wild type _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was not detectable in the _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ under the same _PROTEIN_ conditions . the keg mutation is located in the fifth like repeat of _PROTEIN_ changing a conserved gly to ser . this observation suggests that the like repeats may regulate subcellular localization . to further test this hypothesis a c terminal deletion mutant lacking the entire like repeat domain was made . this rka construct retained the _PROTEIN_ finger ligase domain the kinase domain and the ankyrin repeat domain . compared with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ rka _METHOD_ displayed much less localization to vesicles instead localizing primarily to the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ . this change in localization was not due to the degradation of rka _METHOD_ as immunoblot analysis revealed rka _METHOD_ to be intact . these results indicate that like repeats play a central role in targeting _PROTEIN_ to the tgn/ee and that the keg mutation partially abrogates this function . although deletion of the like repeats substantially reduced the localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to punctate structures it did not entirely eliminate it . to assess whether the remaining punctate structures represented tgn/ee vesicles we coexpressed keg _METHOD_ and rka _METHOD_ with wild type _PROTEIN_ fused to mcherry . both _PROTEIN_ derivatives colocalized with wild type mcherry _PROTEIN_ indicating that the punctate structures corresponded to tgn/ee vesicles . consistent with this conclusion both keg _METHOD_ and rka _METHOD_ showed a twin spot pattern when coexpressed with the cis _LOCATION_ marker gmman mcherry as observed with wild type _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . to better understand the molecular and cellular _METHOD_ behind the genetic interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we asked whether the subcellular localizations of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are interdependent . first we transiently _PROTEIN_ a constitutive promoter driven _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct alone in n. benthamiana and observed a mostly _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ distribution of the yellow florescent signal . a similar localization pattern was also observed in arabidopsis using protoplast transfection . notably neither system showed localization of _PROTEIN_ to tgn/ee like vesicles suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ do not colocalize . however when we transiently coexpressed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with _PROTEIN_ mcherry in n. benthamiana a major portion of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ relocalized to _PROTEIN_ containing vesicles . to exclude that this localization change was an artifact caused by overexpression of _PROTEIN_ mcherry free _METHOD_ was transiently coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ mcherry in n. benthamiana . no translocation of free _METHOD_ to _PROTEIN_ containing vesicles was observed suggesting that _PROTEIN_ induced relocalization to vesicles is specific to _PROTEIN_ . also to demonstrate that the vesicle localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is specifically induced by _PROTEIN_ but not by other components involved in endocytic trafficking pathways mcherry _PROTEIN_ was coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . no vesicular _METHOD_ signal was observed for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . lastly to confirm that the _PROTEIN_ positive vesicles are tgn/ee vesicles hemagglutinin _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and mcherry _PROTEIN_ were transiently coexpressed in n. benthamiana . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ colocalized with mcherry _PROTEIN_ showing that _PROTEIN_ localizes to tgn/ee vesicles when coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ . we also observed that _PROTEIN_ mcherry and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ colocalized when coexpressed in arabidopsis protoplasts indicating that this colocalization is not an artifact caused by _PROTEIN_ in a heterologous system . as demonstrated above deletion of the like repeats dramatically reduced _PROTEIN_ s association with the tgn/ee but did not totally abolish it . to test whether the remaining tgn/ee associated rka protein can still mediate the relocalization of _PROTEIN_ we transiently coexpressed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and rka mcherry in arabidopsis protoplasts . deletion of the like repeats abolished _PROTEIN_ localization to the tgn/ee indicating that the like repeats are required for this process . however the keg mutation did not block _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ relocalization suggesting that the keg mutation does not completely eliminate the function of the like repeats . the like repeats by _METHOD_ fused with mcherry did not display a clear vesicular localization pattern suggesting that targeting of _PROTEIN_ to the tgn/ee requires both the rka domain and the like repeats . the _PROTEIN_ dependent recruitment of _PROTEIN_ to tgn/ee vesicles suggested that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ might physically interact . we used yeast two hybrid analysis to test this hypothesis . no direct interaction between wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was detected . however the interaction between a kinase and its substrate can sometimes be too transient to detect in yeast two hybrid assays . in order to slow the process of _PROTEIN_ dissociation from its substrate a substrate trap version of _PROTEIN_ was generated . the kinase domain of _PROTEIN_ was mutated to disrupt its phosphotransfer domain which is necessary for substrate phosphorylation thus stabilizing the potential interaction between _PROTEIN_ and its substrates . significantly interacted with full length _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ may be a substrate of _PROTEIN_ . the substrate trap mutation in did not affect its endosomal localization upon coexpression with _PROTEIN_ . consistent with the finding that the like repeats are required for _PROTEIN_ localization to the tgn/ee deletion of the like repeats abrogated _PROTEIN_ interaction in yeast supporting the conclusion that the _PROTEIN_ dependent _PROTEIN_ localization to the tgn/ee was based on a direct interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mediated by the like repeats . to confirm the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in planta we performed coimmunoprecipitation analyses using transient _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana . consistent with the yeast two hybrid analysis ha coimmunoprecipitated with _PROTEIN_ myc demonstrating that the _PROTEIN_ interaction occurs in planta . in contrast to the yeast two hybrid results wild type _PROTEIN_ ha also coimmunoprecipitated with _PROTEIN_ myc although this interaction appeared to be slightly weaker than with . coimmunoprecipitation of rka myc with either _PROTEIN_ or was not detectable indicating that the like repeats are required for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction . to test whether immunoprecipitation of ha resulted in nonspecific precipitation of other tgn/ee localized proteins we included myc _PROTEIN_ as an additional control . myc _PROTEIN_ did not coimmunoprecipitate with ha indicating that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction is specific and not the result of bulk precipitation of tgn/ee vesicles . because _PROTEIN_ appears to be endomembrane associated and many _LOCATION_ associated proteins are known to oligomerize we asked whether _PROTEIN_ interacts with itself and if so which domain is necessary and/or sufficient . yeast two hybrid analysis showed that full length _PROTEIN_ can interact with itself . to confirm that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction occurs in planta we performed coimmunoprecipitation analyses using transient _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana . a full length _PROTEIN_ myc construct was transiently _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ rka _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ a plant disease resistance protein served as a negative control . consistent with the yeast two hybrid result _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ coimmunoprecipitated with _PROTEIN_ myc demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction occurs in planta . coimmunoprecipitation of rka _METHOD_ with full length _PROTEIN_ myc was much weaker whereas _METHOD_ coimmunoprecipitated strongly with full length _PROTEIN_ myc . none of these three constructs coimmunoprecipitated with _PROTEIN_ myc demonstrating that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction was specific . taken together these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ can at least dimerize in vivo and that the like repeats are required for this interaction .

suc under a photoperiod of h of light and h of dark at . seven day old seedlings were transferred from half strength murashige and skoog plates to metromix soil . nicotiana benthamiana plants used for

cauliflower mosaic virus promoter or with a modified version of the vector . to produce the latter vector the promoter of was replaced with the _PROTEIN_ native promoter _PROTEIN_ using kpni and hindiii restriction sites flanking the promoter region . for transient transformation of n. benthamiana leaves and arabidopsis protoplasts the above pbsdonr constructs were recombined with the gw
