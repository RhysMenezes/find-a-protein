condensin complexes are thought to play essential roles in mitotic chromosome assembly and segregation in eukaryotes . to date two condensin complexes have been identified . both complexes contain two structural _PROTEIN_ of chromosome subunits and three non smc subunits . in plants little is known about the localization and function of all the condensin subunits . here we report the analyses on the localization of a non smc subunit of arabidopsis condensin i and ii atcap h and atcap respectively . our study indicated that localization of atcap h and atcap is dynamically changed through the mitotic cell cycle using _METHOD_ tagged atcap h and atcap in tobacco cultured cells . they are localized at mitotic chromosomes from prometaphase to telophase . however their localization in interphase is quite different . atcap h was _PROTEIN_ found in the cytoplasm whereas atcap was _PROTEIN_ found in a nucleolus . it is revealed using _METHOD_ tagged deletion mutant s of atcap h that the kleisin middle domain is a unique domain only in atcap h responsible for chromosomal localization . we propose that the gm domain of cap h is essential for its chromosomal localization at mitosis and thus proper function of cap h. differences in localization of atcap h and atcap at interphase also suggest their functional differentiation .
based on the nucleotide sequences of putative atcap h and atcap we designed the gene specific primers to obtain the coding region of the genes and performed rt pcr to amplify the cdnas . sequence analysis revealed that atcap h contained a bp coding region with exons in bp genomic sequence . atcap contained a bp coding region with exons in bp genomic sequence . the deduced atcap h and atcap proteins have amino acids and amino acids respectively . the amino acid sequences and gene structures are shown in fig . . the nucleotide sequences have been submitted to ddbj under accession numbers and . atcap h and atcap belong to the kleisin superfamily and also have the relatively conserved n and c terminal regions . in addition atcap h has the conserved domain among cap h in the middle region . this domain was referred to as the kleisin middle domain . then we designed the genes specific primers and analyzed the _PROTEIN_ pattern of atcap h and atcap using semiquantitative reverse transcriptase mediated pcr from arabidopsis roots _METHOD_ leaves flower buds flowers and whole plants germinated after three days . atcap h _PROTEIN_ at higher levels in flower bud and flower than the other organs . atcap was not different in _PROTEIN_ level among tissues examined . to investigate localization patterns of atcap h and atcap transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ atcap h and _METHOD_ atcap were monitored in a. cells . approximately of the cells showed _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in cells although about of the cells showed _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the case where only the _METHOD_ genes were transformed . as shown in fig . _METHOD_ atcap h was _PROTEIN_ localized in the cytoplasm while _METHOD_ atcap was localized at the _LOCATION_ especially in the nucleolus . to investigate the dynamic localizations of atcap h and atcap we transformed either _METHOD_ atcap h or _METHOD_ atcap into bright yellow tobacco cells . by cultured cells are suitable materials for dynamic analyses during mitosis because the chromosome size is large and the cell cycle is short . the transformed cells were selected in the media containing hygromycin . in each transformation line almost all cells show the same _METHOD_ _METHOD_ pattern . the growth rate and the morphology of each cell line were almost the same as the original by cells . figure shows the subcellular localization of _METHOD_ atcap h at different cell stages . in interphase _METHOD_ signals were predominantly localized in the cytoplasm of the cells transformed with _METHOD_ atcap h. this localization pattern was the same as that in arabidopsis cells . _METHOD_ atcap h was not localized at mitotic chromosomes but localized at the cytoplasm until the end of prophase . in prometaphase the signals were detected on the chromosomes . in metaphase almost all the signals were moved to the chromosomes and the signal intensity was rapidly increased . after chromosome segregation a few signals were diffused into the cytoplasm but the _PROTEIN_ signal remained on the chromosomes . the signals at the chromosomes were finally diffused to the cytoplasm after cytokinesis . the dynamics in localization of _METHOD_ atcap are shown in fig . . in interphase _METHOD_ signals were _PROTEIN_ detected in the nucleolus and slightly detected in the nucleoplasm . the _METHOD_ signals were also detected on the chromatin in interphase suggesting that atcap interacts with interphase chromatin . this localization pattern was also the same as that in arabidopsis cells . the signals were localized in the nucleolus until the end of prophase . the signals were moved _PROTEIN_ to the entire chromosomes after the nucleolus disappeared . the signal intensity on the chromosomes was weaker than that of atcap h. during the chromosome segregation the signals were equally localized on both chromatids . when the nucleolus was formed in the _LOCATION_ the signals appeared again in the nucleolus . atcap h has two relatively conserved n and c terminal regions among the proteins in the kleisin superfamily . thus atcap h was structurally differentiated into the three conserved regions such as the n terminal region the middle region and the c terminal region . in addition among the kleisin family a highly conserved ten amino acid sequence was found in atcap h. to dissect which domains of atcap h are involved in such chromosomal localization atcap h deletion mutants were fused with _METHOD_ and their localizations in transformed by cells were examined . the _METHOD_ atcap h deleted with only aa of the c terminal region _METHOD_ or deleted with aa of the c terminal region _METHOD_ localized at most of the mitotic chromosomes but the localization is slightly loose . similar results were obtained for _METHOD_ atcap h with aa of the middle region _METHOD_ although the signals were observed not only on the chromosomes but also in the cytoplasm . however the _METHOD_ atcap h with the n region or c region showed no longer localization at mitotic chromosomes _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . thus the protein domains responsible for chromosomal localization would be at least in the m region of atcap h. moreover the deletion of the gm domain resulted in no localization of the _METHOD_ atcap h _METHOD_ at mitotic chromosomes . the mutant proteins with the gm domain were localized on chromosomes in mitotic cells . thus the gm domain is essential for atcap h to be localized on mitotic chromosomes .
arabidopsis thaliana ecotype columbia was used for isolation of atcap h and atcap . plants were grown at under a h h dark regime . a. thaliana cell line was obtained from the _PROTEIN_ bioresource center . the cells were _PROTEIN_ at under continuous light . nicotiana tabacum suspension culture cell line bright yellow was used for the localization analysis using _METHOD_ fusion genes . the by cells were subcultured weekly fold diluted with linsmaier and skoog medium according to nagata et al . . the cell suspension was agitated on a rotary shaker at rpm at in the dark . total rna was extracted from arabidopsis roots _METHOD_ leaves flower buds flowers and whole plants germinated after three days using _PROTEIN_ reagent . the mrnas were isolated from the total rna samples using polyattract mrna isolation _METHOD_ . the mrna was used for the first strand cdna synthesis using a poly dt primer . the cdna fragments of atcap h and atcap were amplified using gene specific primers _PROTEIN_ . rt pcr was also performed with primers as a control . cloning of atcap h and atcap was performed as described by sambrook et al . . the coding sequences of atcap h and atcap were amplified using gene specific primers with the recombination site _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the amplified fragments were cloned into using a in vitro recombination system . the nucleotide sequences were checked with a dna sequencer _METHOD_ . thereafter cloned cdnas were recombined into the binary vector with a recombination cassette for the _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ fused proteins under the control of a promoter . deletion mutants were generated with pcr primers incorporating the deletion and the deletion of each construct was confirmed by dna sequencing . polyethylene glycol mediated a. thaliana protoplast transformation was according to the method described by leon et al . with some modifications . the cells were incubated in enzyme solution containing cellulase onozuka r macerozyme r mm m mannitol for h at room temperature under gentle shaking . protoplasts were collected by centrifugation for min at g washed twice with solution _PROTEIN_ and resuspended in mamg solution . after incubation on ice for min protoplasts were adjusted to cells/ml with mamg solution . a of peg solution polyethylene glycol m mannitol and m ca was added for of plasmid protoplasts solution and mixed gently . after incubation for min at room temperature of solution was added and the peg solution was removed by centrifugation for min at g. the protoplasts were resuspended in solution and left at . transformation was performed using by cells days after subculture as described previously . after day incubation at the inoculated by cells were transferred into liquid ls medium containing _PROTEIN_ and hygromycin . the resulting transformed cell lines were _PROTEIN_ by fold dilutions at weekly intervals as described above . two days after subculture by cells were used for the localization analysis . dna in the cells were visualized with of dapi containing triton x . the cell images were obtained with a zeiss axioplan ii _METHOD_ microscope and a cooled ccd camera . further image processing and assembly were performed with the adobe photoshop software .
