_LOCATION_ autophagy is a major pathway by which eukaryotic cells degrade macromolecules either to remove damaged or unnecessary proteins or to produce respiratory substrates and raw materials to survive periods of nutrient deficiency . during autophagy a double _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ around cytoplasmic components to generate an autophagosome which is transported to the _LOCATION_ . the outer _LOCATION_ fuses with the _LOCATION_ or lysosome and the inner _LOCATION_ and its contents are degraded by _LOCATION_ or lysosomal hydrolases . we have identified a small gene family in arabidopsis thaliana members of which show sequence similarity to the yeast autophagy gene _PROTEIN_ . members of the gene family are differentially _PROTEIN_ in response to different growth conditions and one member of this family _PROTEIN_ is induced both during sucrose and nitrogen starvation and during senescence . rna interference was used to generate transgenic lines with reduced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . these lines show hypersensitivity to sucrose and nitrogen starvation and premature senescence both during natural senescence of leaves and in a detached leaf assay . staining with the autophagosome specific _METHOD_ dye monodansylcadaverine revealed that unlike wild type plants _PROTEIN_ rna interference plants are unable to produce autophagosomes in response to starvation or senescence conditions . we conclude that the _PROTEIN_ protein is likely to be required for autophagosome formation in arabidopsis .
blast searches of the arabidopsis genome revealed eight potential encoded proteins related to _PROTEIN_ named _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . sequence comparisons of the full length proteins revealed that the predicted arabidopsis proteins shared between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ amino acid identity with yeast _PROTEIN_ . based on phylogenetic analysis these eight predicted proteins appear to form three major subgroups _PROTEIN_ c d and e cluster with the yeast protein _PROTEIN_ is most similar to _PROTEIN_ itself and _PROTEIN_ g and h are more divergent forming a separate clade . none of the arabidopsis proteins appear closely related to the yeast cvt pathway specific protein _PROTEIN_ . to determine whether the clustering of arabidopsis genes with yeast or _PROTEIN_ is statistically significant the maximum likelihood tree was compared with all possible tree topologies containing the three yeast sequences constrained into a single clade . approximately unbiased analysis indicated that the ml tree was significantly more likely than the best constrained tree . sequence analysis with pfam indicates that all genes are predicted to encode proteins with one to three wd repeats the numbers and locations of wd domains in the compared with the yeast proteins are shown in figure . all of the proteins are predicted by the pssm fold recognition server to fold as seven bladed propellers with high similarity scores when compared with known seven bladed propeller proteins . no other conserved functional domains were identified in any of the predicted arabidopsis proteins . to determine whether all genes have detectable transcript levels and identify the organs where the genes are _PROTEIN_ specific primers for each of the were designed and rt pcr was performed using rna from root leaf inflorescence stem and flower . seven of the transcripts were detected in all or some of the organs tested with _PROTEIN_ b c and d transcripts detected in all organs and _PROTEIN_ g and h having a more restricted _PROTEIN_ pattern . _PROTEIN_ was not detectable in any organ or under any of the conditions tested . based on morphological analyses and mutant phenotypes autophagy is thought to function in nutrient deprivation and senescence in plants . to investigate the _PROTEIN_ pattern of the genes during nutrient deprivation rt pcr was performed using rna from seedlings starved for sucrose or nitrogen . four genes _PROTEIN_ showed an increase in transcript level in both sucrose and nitrogen starvation conditions whereas the others show no change under these conditions . to investigate the gene _PROTEIN_ pattern during senescence detached leaf assays were performed . first and second true leaves from week old seedlings were detached and incubated in the dark for up to h and rna isolated . rt pcr revealed only one gene _PROTEIN_ whose transcript level increases during this artificial senescence process . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ two senescence associated genes were used as senescence _PROTEIN_ controls . comparing the _PROTEIN_ pattern of the genes during starvation and senescence only _PROTEIN_ is upregulated in both conditions suggesting that _PROTEIN_ may have an important role in these two conditions . we therefore decided to focus initially on the functional analysis of this member of the gene family . to investigate the physiological role of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis rna interference was used to generate transgenic plants with a reduced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ level . arabidopsis thaliana plants were transformed with an rnai construct consisting of an inverted repeat of a unique bp region of the _PROTEIN_ gene with a portion of the gus gene as a linker driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . transformants were screened by rt pcr for _PROTEIN_ transcript levels and three rnai lines with reduced _PROTEIN_ transcript level were identified . the reduction in _PROTEIN_ transcript level was gene specific as the other transcript levels were unchanged compared with those of wild type plants . to investigate the role of _PROTEIN_ during nutrient starvation growth of the _PROTEIN_ rnai lines was compared with wt plants under nitrogen or sucrose starvation conditions . for nitrogen starvation day old seedlings grown on nutrient murashige and skoog _METHOD_ solid medium were transferred to nitrogen depleted _METHOD_ solid medium and incubated in long day light conditions . after days of nitrogen starvation the _PROTEIN_ rnai seedlings began to lose their green color and accumulate anthocyanins whereas wt seedlings remained green . after days the _PROTEIN_ rnai seedlings were brown compared with the wt seedlings that retained some chlorophyll . growth under _PROTEIN_ starvation conditions was also analyzed . for _PROTEIN_ starvation day old seedlings grown on nutrient _METHOD_ solid medium were transferred to _METHOD_ solid medium without sucrose and incubated in h dark conditions . rnai seedlings were hypersensitive to _PROTEIN_ starvation as chlorosis was observed earlier in all three _PROTEIN_ rnai lines compared with wt seedlings . after days the cotyledons of _PROTEIN_ rnai seedlings were yellow whereas wt cotyledons retained a pale green color . to further confirm the observed phenotype the chlorophyll content of wt and rnai seedlings was analyzed throughout the nitrogen and sucrose starvation time courses . total chlorophyll per gram fresh weight of tissue was calculated according to citation and _PROTEIN_ as a percentage of the original chlorophyll content at days . the chlorophyll content of _PROTEIN_ rnai plants _PROTEIN_ more rapidly during both nitrogen and _PROTEIN_ starvation compared with wt plants . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ rnai transgenic plants are more sensitive to nutrient deprivation conditions and therefore _PROTEIN_ may function in the response of plants to starvation . under normal nutrient medium and soil conditions the _PROTEIN_ rnai plants did not exhibit any differences compared with wt plants in rate or efficiency of seed germination elongation of the root system seedling development or flowering time . however after bolting the rosette leaves of _PROTEIN_ rnai plants senesced faster than wt plant rosette leaves . rosette leaves of rnai plants were indistinguishable from wt rosette leaves at days after germination . at days the rosette leaves of _PROTEIN_ rnai plants began to turn yellow whereas wt leaves did not begin to senesce until around days . after days most of the rnai plant rosette leaves had senesced and were brown whereas most of the wt rosette leaves remained green . to better understand the role of _PROTEIN_ during leaf senescence a detached leaf assay was used . the first and second true leaves of week old wt and _PROTEIN_ rnai seedlings grown on nutrient rich _METHOD_ medium were detached and incubated in the dark . leaves from each of the rnai lines displayed accelerated senescence when compared with wt leaves demonstrated by the visible loss of chlorophyll . the _PROTEIN_ of two arabidopsis leaf senescence marker genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was also examined during the detached leaf assay time course by rt pcr . for both genes an increase in _PROTEIN_ was observed earlier in the rnai leaves than in wt leaves with _PROTEIN_ increasing after h in the rnai lines compared with h in the control . _PROTEIN_ was apparently already _PROTEIN_ at high levels in the rnai lines even at the h time point when compared with wt plants . this provides a molecular confirmation of the early senescence phenotype observed . in yeast _PROTEIN_ is required for autophagosome formation . monodansylcadaverine is a _METHOD_ drug that specifically stains autophagosomes in animals and arabidopsis . to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ is required for autophagosome formation in arabidopsis day old wt and _PROTEIN_ rnai seedlings were transferred to nitrogen or sucrose starvation conditions for days and then stained with mdc . numerous moving mdc stained autophagosomes accumulated in wt root cells during starvation observed by _METHOD_ microscopy . this accumulation was disrupted in _PROTEIN_ rnai root cells with no autophagosomes visible after either nitrogen or sucrose starvation . to confirm that the lack of labeled structures in the rnai lines is due to a loss of autophagosomes rather than a change in their structure that prevents mdc staining protoplasts from wt and rnai plants were transformed with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and starved for days . numerous motile _METHOD_ labeled autophagosomes were seen in wt protoplasts whereas only diffuse labeling was seen in the rnai protoplasts similar to that seen in wt protoplasts prior to starvation . we conclude that loss of _PROTEIN_ prevents autophagosome formation during starvation . to determine the role of _PROTEIN_ during senescence protoplasts were prepared from wt and rnai detached leaves after days of dark incubation and then stained with mdc . whereas mdc stained autophagosomes were abundant in the wt protoplasts very few were seen in the _PROTEIN_ rnai protoplasts indicating that senescence induced autophagy also requires _PROTEIN_ . these data imply that _PROTEIN_ is required for autophagosome formation in arabidopsis during nutrient stress and senescence and further indicate that the phenotypes of hypersensitivity to nutrient deprivation and early senescence are caused by defects in normal autophagy function .
