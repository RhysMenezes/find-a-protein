the involvement of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in salt stress responses in arabidopsis has been reported previously . many of the _PROTEIN_ downstream genes identified through microarray analysis have been also reported to be by aba which led us to investigate the function of in the aba response in arabidopsis . it is well known that both aba content and aba signaling are essential for the regulation of the transition from seed dormancy to seed germination . the germination capability of two knockout lines in the absence and presence of aba was checked first . it was found that the null mutants germinated at a similar rate to the wt plants on normal _METHOD_ growth medium however when aba was included in the growth medium the null mutants germinated much more slowly than the wt plants . the percentage of cotyledon greening was also lower in the mutants than in the wt . the phenotype of was also confirmed in a experiment considering a range of aba and in a experiment . when the coding sequence of was _PROTEIN_ in the background driven by the promoter the phenotype of the mutant was rescued . thus is a negative regulator of aba signaling during seed germination in arabidopsis . it is known that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are substrates of in arabidopsis during salt and _LOCATION_ stress responses however neither single null mutants of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ nor those of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were sensitive to aba during germination . to generate the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ double mutant _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were crossed . of the _PROTEIN_ plants or the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants did not result in a _PROTEIN_ genotype in the progeny indicating that knockouts of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are synthetic lethal in arabidopsis . in order to know whether constitutively active _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ and/or _PROTEIN_ lacking the transmembrane domains and _LOCATION_ could restore the aba sensitivity of null mutant to the wt level the truncated form of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with their respective native promoter was _PROTEIN_ in the background . it was found that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fully restored the aba sensitivity of mutant to the wt level while _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ did not . we conclude that _PROTEIN_ possibly is involved in the aba response during seed germination and is most probably one of the targets in arabidopsis imbibed seeds . an _METHOD_ or form of _PROTEIN_ was processed and translocated from the _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ in response to salt stress or heat stress . we were interested to know whether _PROTEIN_ is also activated by aba treatment . an form of _PROTEIN_ was transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaves which were then subjected to aba treatment . western blotting analyses demonstrated that aba treatment the level of the processed form . in order to examine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ and also to know whether the _LOCATION_ domain and the transmembrane domain of _PROTEIN_ are sufficient for the possible _LOCATION_ translocation we replaced the of _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ and the fusion protein _METHOD_ was transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco epidermal cells as we did for _PROTEIN_ . as predicted _METHOD_ was observed as _LOCATION_ cytoplasmic strands without aba treatment and colocalized with an _LOCATION_ marker . following aba treatment much of the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signal was observed in the _LOCATION_ and colocalized with a _LOCATION_ marker . these results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is activated and relocates from the _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ in response to aba treatment . five genes participating in responses encoding the phosphatase type family protein _PROTEIN_ the zipper protein _PROTEIN_ the nac transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the ef hand protein _PROTEIN_ and the lipid transfer protein _PROTEIN_ have been previously identified as downstream targets of _PROTEIN_ under salt stress . we conducted to compare the _PROTEIN_ level of these genes in wt and mutant backgrounds with or without aba treatment during seed germination . eight _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and one _PROTEIN_ zipper gene _PROTEIN_ were also included in the study . among the genes investigated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were induced more than twofold by aba treatment while the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was below the detection limit in the wt . in contrast to the wt the of five genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by aba treatment was greatly impaired in the mutant . the mutant is expected to be less sensitive to aba than the _PROTEIN_ mutant because the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is not abolished in the mutant . our previous experiments have demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are downstream targets of _PROTEIN_ . similar _PROTEIN_ experiments were performed to check whether _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are also downstream targets of _PROTEIN_ . it was found that _METHOD_ was enriched in the promoters of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was not much affected in the mutant suggesting that other transcription _PROTEIN_ may also control _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ during seed germination . thus regulates aba response through controlling the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and its target genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ .
