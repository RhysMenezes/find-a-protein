telomeres are the specialized structures at the end of linear chromosomes and terminate with a single stranded overhang of the g rich strand . the primary role of telomeres is to protect chromosome ends from recombination and fusion and from being recognized as broken dna ends . this protective function can be achieved through association with specific telomere binding proteins . although proteins that bind single stranded g rich overhang regulate telomere length and telomerase activity in mammals and lower eukaryotes equivalent _PROTEIN_ have yet to be identified in plants . here we have identified proteins capable of interacting with the g rich single stranded telomeric repeat from the arabidopsis extracts by affinity chromatography . _PROTEIN_ assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis indicates that the isolated protein is a chloroplast rna binding protein . the truncated derivative which we refer to as _PROTEIN_ binds specifically the single stranded g rich plant telomeric dna sequences but not double stranded telomeric dna . unlike the chloroplast localized full length rna binding protein _PROTEIN_ localizes exclusively to the _LOCATION_ suggesting that it plays a role in plant telomere biogenesis . we also demonstrated that the specific binding of _PROTEIN_ to single stranded telomeric dna inhibits telomerase mediated telomere extension . the evidence presented here suggests that _PROTEIN_ is a telomere end binding protein that may contribute to telomere length regulation by capping the ends of chromosomes and thereby repressing telomerase activity in plants .
identification of arabidopsis proteins that specifically bind to the single stranded g rich telomeric that bind single stranded telomeric overhang play an important role in chromosome capping and telomere length regulation . such proteins have not yet been identified and characterized in plants . to identify telomere end binding proteins in plants affinity chromatography using single stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotide was applied to arabidopsis extracts . the eluted fraction was subjected to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and stained with _METHOD_ blue . the electrophoretic pattern of the proteins recovered by affinity chromatography shows two major bands three intermediate bands and six faint bands having apparent molecular _METHOD_ ranging from to kda . no stainable protein was retained when streptavidin agarose conjugate resins were not functionalized . because arabidopsis extracts were preincubated with nonspecific single stranded oligonucleotide as a competitor dna the retained proteins should show high specificity for the single stranded g rich telomeric sequence . to identify the protein components with the telomere binding activity each protein band was excised from the gel and digested with trypsin and the recovered peptide mixtures were directly subjected to maldi tof _METHOD_ analysis . the obtained _METHOD_ data were fitted by _METHOD_ fit data base search analysis . although there were some unidentified bands that had no matching proteins in the data base this method allowed us to identify nine polypeptides . table ii shows the peptide _METHOD_ fingerprint results which contain ncbi accession number theoretical and experimental molecular weights the number of matching peptides and the amino acid coverage of the obtained peptides . bands and were identified as a chloroplast rna binding protein _PROTEIN_ that contains four structural domains a chloroplast transit peptide in the n terminus followed by an acidic domain and a tandem pair of rna binding domains _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the c terminus . band was identified as a truncated derivative lacking the n terminal chloroplast transit peptide and acidic domain . it was previously reported that the single chloroplast rna binding protein gene generates multiple messages that potentially encode two distinct proteins . although the larger messages encode a full length protein that functions in chloroplast the shorter messages encode a truncated derivative _PROTEIN_ that is likely to function in cellular compartments other than chloroplast due to the absence of a chloroplast transit peptide . binding of _PROTEIN_ to single stranded telomeric _PROTEIN_ contains an rna binding domain and is a member of the hnrnp family . the hnrnps have been implicated to have roles in telomere and telomerase regulation . therefore we sought to examine whether _PROTEIN_ interacts directly with the single stranded g rich telomeric repeat . recombinant _METHOD_ of full length _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ n terminal half _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ in bacteria and used in gel shift assays with a labeled _PROTEIN_ oligonucleotide having four plant telomeric repeats . as shown in fig . _PROTEIN_ gave rise to a discrete protein dna complex that migrated more slowly than the free probe . intensities of shifted bands increased upon the addition of increasing amounts of the protein . likewise _PROTEIN_ bound slightly more efficiently to _PROTEIN_ than _PROTEIN_ . in contrast nt containing the transit peptide and acidic domains did not show any binding activity under the conditions used in these experiments . we also tested the binding activity of each _PROTEIN_ . no binding activity was observed in _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . sequence specificity of _PROTEIN_ binding to single stranded telomeric determine the relative binding specificity of _PROTEIN_ to plant telomeric sequence we performed various competition experiments . the complex detected in _PROTEIN_ was significantly reduced in the presence of fold excess of unlabeled _PROTEIN_ oligonucleotide and completely disappeared by fold excess . when the human telomeric repeats were substituted for the plant telomeric repeats competed less efficiently than its counterpart for the _PROTEIN_ binding activity . in contrast the signals were not diminished by the addition of the same molar excess of unlabeled caenorhabditis elegans telomeric repeats . to see whether _PROTEIN_ binds to double stranded telomeric dna a duplex dna that contains copies of the telomeric repeats was prepared . even when excess amounts of double stranded telomeric dna were used as competitor dna the binding activity remained unaffected . we next determined the sequence specificity of the _PROTEIN_ binding activity at nucleotide level . a series of mutant oligonucleotides were synthesized and assayed for their ability to bind _PROTEIN_ . each oligonucleotide contained a single nucleotide transition at the same position in all four repeats of tttaggg . gel shift assays with _PROTEIN_ revealed that shifted efficiently than _PROTEIN_ whereas and _PROTEIN_ were slightly weaker binders . however and were incapable of significant binding . these results indicate that the binding between _PROTEIN_ and plant telomeric repeats is very specific for the first three bases and the sixth base of the tttaggg repeats with some additional preference for a t over an a in position of the repeats . the minimal number of the telomeric repeats needed for binding was determined using oligonucleotides containing different copy numbers of the telomeric repeats . _PROTEIN_ did not bind two copies of tttaggg but it efficiently bound three copies of tttaggg although the binding affinity is slightly lower than four copies of tttaggg . these results indicate that the minimal length of the dna probe required for complex formation is at least three contiguous tttaggg repeats . _PROTEIN_ inhibits telomerase mediated examine whether _PROTEIN_ could affect the ability of telomerase to extend telomeric dna and to gain some insight into the possible function of the protein recombinant _PROTEIN_ lacking the _PROTEIN_ moiety was added to the telomerase fraction extracted from arabidopsis . after the telomerase reaction the extended telomeric dna was purified to avoid taq polymerase inhibitors contained in the extracts and to exclude the effect of supplemented _PROTEIN_ on pcr and amplified by the trap method . the amplified products were analyzed on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel . no telomere elongation was detected in the absence of telomerase extract or when the extract was treated with rnase to inactivate the telomerase activity . in the absence of _PROTEIN_ telomerase activity was readily detected indicative of addition of multiple repeats to the substrate primer . as shown in fig . the supplemented _PROTEIN_ inhibited telomerase extension in a dose dependent manner . note that inhibition by _PROTEIN_ reduced the overall rate of telomerase reaction but not the relative length of dna products . to allow quantification the band intensities of extension products were analyzed and dose response curves were generated . addition of _PROTEIN_ reduced the formation of the telomerase products by when compared with telomerase activity in the absence of _PROTEIN_ . to examine whether _PROTEIN_ binding to the extended telomerase substrates is required for the inhibition of telomerase activity telomerase reaction mixtures were mixed with nt _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . none of these proteins inhibited telomerase extension . because _PROTEIN_ binds to the human telomeric repeats although its binding is weaker than the plant telomeric repeats we examined whether _PROTEIN_ affects the activity of human telomerase . addition of increasing amounts of _PROTEIN_ led to a gradual reduction in telomerase activity . taken together our results suggest that stable _PROTEIN_ binding to telomeric dna inhibits telomerase activity . _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lacks a chloroplast transit peptide and binds specifically to telomeric repeats it could function in _LOCATION_ . to address this issue we determined whether _PROTEIN_ is targeted to the _LOCATION_ . the coding sequence of _PROTEIN_ was fused in frame to the n terminus of _METHOD_ coding sequence using a conventional _METHOD_ fusion recombinant plasmid . the gene encoding _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was introduced into onion epidermal cells using a helium biolistic particle delivery system . the onion epidermal cells _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein were examined with a _METHOD_ microscope . _METHOD_ was detected as a dense glittering spot which corresponds well with the position of the _LOCATION_ . for comparison _METHOD_ alone was used as a control for subcellular localization . _METHOD_ control was distributed in both cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ . unlike the chloroplast localized full length _PROTEIN_ protein our observations suggest that _PROTEIN_ is capable of localizing exclusively to the _LOCATION_ and is involved in plant telomere biogenesis .
