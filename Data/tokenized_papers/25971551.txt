_METHOD_ based protein protein interaction techniques are vital tools for understanding in vivo cellular functions on a mechanistic level . however only under the condition of highly efficient transformation and accumulation can techniques such as resonance energy transfer realize their potential for providing highly accurate and quantitative interaction data . fret as a _METHOD_ based method unifies several advantages such as measuring in an in vivo environment real time context and the ability to include transient interactions as well as detecting the mere proximity of proteins . here we introduce a novel vector set that incorporates the benefit of the recombination based cloning system with the _PROTEIN_ state of the art _METHOD_ proteins for optimal coaccumulation and fret output studies . we demonstrate its utility across a range of methods . merging the cloning system with new generation fret fluorophore pairs allows for enhanced detection speeds up the preparation of clones and enables colocalization studies and the identification of meaningful protein protein interactions in vivo .
the system makes use of the phage recombination sites that are commercially exploited in the multisite gateway system of life technologies . the rationale behind the approach was to establish two independent functional _PROTEIN_ cassettes on the same vector backbone while _PROTEIN_ the ease of recombination based cloning with two different positive selection markers . this strategy thus allows for simultaneous and directional insertion of two genes into two _PROTEIN_ cassettes flanked by individual promoters and tags which then are _PROTEIN_ from the same vector backbone . as constructed one of the cassettes is a modified version of the classical gateway cassette . it consists of the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase and the control of cell death b gene flanked by and sites . the ccdb gene is toxic for most escherichia coli cloning strains thereby precluding nonrecombinant clones . the second recombination cassette contains the lacz _PROTEIN_ cassette delimited by and sites on either side . both cassettes allow directional and site specific integration of genes of interest via recombination from the gateway entry vector constructs and . the vectors designed for this work gave recombination efficiencies comparable to previously published vectors of the rbifc set . vectors and constructs that are needed to perform cloning are summarized in table i . figure shows the normalized absorbance and emission spectra including the weighted spectral overlaps of mvenus monomeric enhanced green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ mcherry and mvenus _METHOD_ pairs selected for the fret vectors . exemplary pseudocolor images of the coexpression of _LOCATION_ localized basic _PROTEIN_ a gaga motif binding protein with itself were chosen for representation of the wavelength emission peaks of each _METHOD_ . table ii lists the crucial fret related spectral properties of the state of the art _METHOD_ that were chosen . particular attention is given to properties relevant for fret flim studies although the fluorophore pairs are also suitable for intensity based fret approaches and localization studies . in _METHOD_ of quantum yield and brightness the donor chromophores _METHOD_ and mvenus are the gold standards within their spectral ranges . these fluorophores also benefit from photostability and their folding efficiency is among the highest of the _PROTEIN_ generation of _METHOD_ . each donor can be excited with one of the three major argon laser wavelengths used in confocal microscopy nm nm _METHOD_ and nm . due to their excellent spectral overlap mvenus mcherry and _METHOD_ were chosen as fret acceptors respectively . each pair namely mvenus _METHOD_ mcherry and mvenus _METHOD_ was used in generating four different vectors thus allowing for the _PROTEIN_ of all possible combinations of either n or c terminal _METHOD_ fusions . in addition the chromophores chosen in this vector set are all monomeric thereby avoiding dimerization or quenching due to fluorophore interaction . while the fret pairs _METHOD_ mcherry and mvenus were demonstrated before to our knowledge the pair mvenus _METHOD_ has not been used previously . a prerequisite for _PROTEIN_ analysis is information on subcellular localization of the proteins of choice . in spite of the reservations associated with heterologous _PROTEIN_ of genes depleted of their regulatory sequences transient or stable coexpression of two genes from a vector is a feasible and fast way to determine subcellular localization . soluble n ethylmaleimide sensitive _PROTEIN_ attachment protein receptor proteins which drive the final step in _LOCATION_ fusion events are often used as _LOCATION_ markers due to their specific subcellular localization patterns . the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ snare syntaxin of _PROTEIN_ vesicle and pm localized vesicle associated _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized snare _PROTEIN_ were used here to assess the vector potential for localization studies . figure and supplemental figure demonstrate the use of pfretgc vectors to determine and distinguish the subcellular localization of the aforementioned proteins while using different transformation procedures and hosts . figure depicts the spatial differences in subcellular localization of the snare proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in transient transfection of nicotiana benthamiana leaves arabidopsis leaf protoplasts and stably transformed arabidopsis columbia plants . in addition supplemental figure shows partial colocalization of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ in the pm while also highlighting vesicular structures that are solely tagged with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in all three transformation procedures . line _METHOD_ reveal the high spatial resolution providing information on each fusion protein s subcellular localization or its distinction . despite heterologous overexpression all gene products localize to their previously suggested native subcellular compartments . the vector set was primarily anticipated for transient studies in which the promoter is still a powerful driver of _PROTEIN_ despite its inherent silencing issues when used in stable transformants . nevertheless the generation of stably transformed arabidopsis seedlings was analyzed out of basta resistant seedlings that were screened for _METHOD_ signals _PROTEIN_ both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and mcherry _PROTEIN_ . none of the analyzed transformants _PROTEIN_ only one of the two _METHOD_ confirming an expected coexpression and thus cotransformation efficiency of . taken together the fret vectors prove their feasibility to easily assess subcellular localization in both transient and stable transformation . in the latter case the vectors avoid the time consuming step of sequential insertion either by crossing two individually transformed lines or the simultaneous cotransformation of the two individual plasmids using floral dip transformation which has been shown previously to yield only between and cotransformants . also cosegregation excluded the resulting heterozygous lines will yield only double homozygous lines as compared with using one t dna . for quantitative fret studies especially when they are intensity based the accumulation of equal amounts of donor and acceptor _METHOD_ fusion proteins is often ideal . yet no _PROTEIN_ system can guarantee a _PROTEIN_ ratio of fusion proteins . posttranscriptional or posttranslational regulation is likely to alter the stoichiometry even when the identical promoter is used . agroinfiltration has become a widely used technique for fast and reliable transient transformation of n. benthamiana leaves . many subcellular localization studies in transient n. benthamiana rely on coexpression of the protein of interest with a subcellular marker . while for colocalization a cotransformation efficiency is not crucial for other methods such as fret it is often best to have donor and acceptor fusion proteins in the same cell at nearly equal concentrations . the issue of cotransformation ratios was raised in the paragraph above _PROTEIN_ stable transformation . generally literature values vary between and cotransformation probability for transient transformation of arabidopsis root explants . in transiently transformed arabidopsis seedlings using agrobacterium tumefaciens citation found a cotransformation efficiency of up to . to our knowledge there are no data on coexpression ratios of transient transformation of n. benthamiana leaves . we have compared the number of cells that _PROTEIN_ both fusion proteins needed for fret from either two individual plasmids or from the novel vectors . as the exemplary gene for our studies we used _LOCATION_ localized _PROTEIN_ . to avoid the complication of comparing across different vectors we chose to use the same vector not only for the actual transformation of one plasmid with two _PROTEIN_ cassettes but also for the two individually transformed plasmids that contain only one fusion protein . for vectors incorporating only one of the two fusion proteins in the lr reaction an e. coli resistance marker was recombined in the unused of the two _PROTEIN_ cassettes thereby preventing translational read through of that _PROTEIN_ cassette s c terminal _METHOD_ tag . the resulting plasmid contained only one _METHOD_ fusion protein yet the same plasmid backbone was used for the infiltration . we analyzed mean _METHOD_ intensities of _LOCATION_ from different square sections of four independently transformed n. benthamiana leaves that _PROTEIN_ either _PROTEIN_ mcherry _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or both . ratios of mcherry to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were normalized by using the median value of all ratios as denominator for the absolute mcherry values . the box plot diagram in figure shows ratios of above or below the median in red boxes along with each value for _METHOD_ signal represented as black dots . ratios times higher or lower than unity were designated as thresholds for coexpression . this analysis yielded an average cotransformation ratio for all four experiments of for the individual and for the plasmid transformations . as the same promoter and backbone were used the individual ratios also allow a rough estimate of coexpression efficiency . this suggests that despite all potential posttranscriptional or posttranslational events that will be different for each pair of genes and fusion proteins to be analyzed the system allows for less variation in coexpression rates compared with individual plasmid transformation . values slightly below coexpression in constructs could have resulted from truncations of the t dna left border or from silencing of one of the two _PROTEIN_ cassettes in individual cells . nevertheless the nearly complete cotransformation of both fusion proteins in the system illustrates its advantage for assays that are based on transient _PROTEIN_ . as demonstrated in figure the high variance of cotransformations makes finding cells with nearly equal _PROTEIN_ levels cumbersome and time consuming . naturally the _METHOD_ of both fusion proteins would allow one to choose cells that _PROTEIN_ both proteins to similar levels but the temporal advantage of utilizing a dual _PROTEIN_ t dna is obvious . in order to correlate the result of the cotransformation efficiency in figure with intensity based fret approaches we performed ab experiments and measured the fret efficiency of cells transfected with constructs versus cells with two individual plasmids . as a positive control we again employed the _LOCATION_ localized protein _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ and mcherry and its capacity to dimerize . as a negative control _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was coexpressed with _LOCATION_ localized mcherry . exactly as before to avoid the complication of comparing across different vectors the same vector was used for individual and dual _PROTEIN_ . for ab fret experiments _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ were chosen that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and mcherry at apparently equal levels . mean donor _METHOD_ intensity was measured in suitable _LOCATION_ before and after photobleaching of the mcherry acceptor fusion and used to calculate fret efficiency . while the approach using two individual plasmids yielded fret signals for the positive control sample that were significant when compared with the negative control the values showed great variability . contrary to that the fret efficiency values obtained using the approach not only showed less variance but also resulted in higher fret signals in general . taken together these results clearly show that a dual _PROTEIN_ t dna not only saves time in both preparing and performing the experiment but also allows for obtaining less variable and hence more significant results . quantitative as well as semiquantitative fret based interaction studies require for each _METHOD_ a number of parameters to be optimal such as quantum yield oligomerization state ph dependency and photostability . for the fret pair the spectral overlap the acceptor s absorption coefficient and the distance are among the most important parameters . intensity based fret techniques such as donor dequenching through ab are particularly sensitive to the relative concentrations of donor and acceptor and their ratio should be kept as close to a constant value as possible . although this aspect can be tackled using the approach intensity based fret approaches are also subject to other difficulties such as a cross talk caused by donor emission which leaks into the acceptor channel a direct excitation of the acceptor by the illumination source or incomplete photobleaching of all acceptors in the microscopic detection volume . these _METHOD_ are circumvented by measuring fret using flim . this technique takes advantage of the radiative rates of the transition from the excited to the ground state of the donor chromophore which can be related directly to the distance between donor and acceptor fluorophores . if energy transfer to an acceptor occurs an additional relaxation channel for the donor to lose its excitation energy opens . accordingly the radiative transition competes with this additional nonradiative pathway causing the donor _METHOD_ lifetime to be shifted to shorter time values . this reduction in the _METHOD_ lifetime of the quenched donor is connected to the fret efficiency and can be quantified resulting in a unique value for the fusion protein pair . although fret flim requires careful data analysis this method is much less _LOCATION_ prone than intensity based fret methods . figure illustrates the use of the pfretgc and pfrettv vectors in measuring fret flim . the _METHOD_ lifetimes of donor _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with various mcherry acceptor fusions were visualized as bar charts and as heat maps that color code the _METHOD_ lifetime within the area of interest here the _LOCATION_ . the results show that the donor lifetime of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ significantly when coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ mcherry and although slightly weaker with an mcherry fusion protein encoding the _LOCATION_ localization signal dna binding domain fusion of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . there is no lifetime _PROTEIN_ in the absence of an acceptor fusion or when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is coexpressed with a gene coding for _LOCATION_ targeted mcherry . these results indicate a specific homomerization of _PROTEIN_ and a heterotypic interaction of _PROTEIN_ with the dna binding domain of _PROTEIN_ inside the _LOCATION_ . this interaction has been detected before by yeast two hybrid analysis . the same set of proteins was also used to assess the feasibility of the pair in flim analysis with results that virtually copy the _METHOD_ study . striking though is the difference in maximum donor lifetime of as opposed to _METHOD_ . this leads to higher absolute lifetime differences between positive and negative control samples providing a broader range for quantitative and dynamic association measurements . each _PROTEIN_ technique comes with a set of advantages and disadvantages when compared with alternative approaches . a comparison of flim with an alternative _PROTEIN_ technique therefore _METHOD_ appropriate . to eliminate a bias against varying _PROTEIN_ we chose our previously published based rbifc as an alternative method . an interaction between the soluble qb c snare _PROTEIN_ and its corresponding qa snares _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and/or _PROTEIN_ had been shown previously _PROTEIN_ by using coimmunoprecipitation analysis . to our knowledge these interactions have not been demonstrated using either flim or rbifc . as biological negative controls we made use of the qa snare _PROTEIN_ which localizes to the prevacuolar compartment and does not cross interact functionally with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . additionally and to use a control that localizes to the pm we employed a truncated version of _PROTEIN_ that only contains its _LOCATION_ spanning c terminal tail devoid of the known cytoplasmic interaction site . a direct comparison of the two methods using _LOCATION_ localized proteins revealed some differences . as expected an interaction between _PROTEIN_ and the three family snares was identified by both rbifc and flim . both methods also reported a lack of interaction between the noncognate pair of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . however _PROTEIN_ when truncated to its transmembrane domain only yielded a significant rbifc signal with _PROTEIN_ whereas flim analysis showed no difference from the background . we suggest that this seemingly contradictory result highlights the potential for the split fluorophore to stabilize interacting proteins and thereby enhance weak or otherwise transient interactions . qa snares are able to assemble in homomultimers as well as heterodimers with qb c snares and this applies equally to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . it is possible therefore that a weaker association with the _PROTEIN_ transmembrane domain either with _PROTEIN_ or with a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complex could become locked through fluorophore annealing a situation that would not arise when interactions were probed for protein complex dynamics using the fret fluorophore pairs .
vectors were cloned using a combination of gene synthesis and classical cloning . two different strategies were followed one for vectors with both _METHOD_ at the c termini and one for the other tag orientations _PROTEIN_ as n terminal _METHOD_ fusions also carry a c terminal epitope tag . a base vector was created through gene synthesis and subcloning of the synthesized cassette into the binary vector pbifc _PROTEIN_ via pmei/snabi . this resulted in the binary vector pbbb that carries a codon optimized basta _PROTEIN_ cassette adjacent to the left border of the t dna and with four unique blunt end restriction enzyme sites of the right border . for the first strategy a cloning helper vector was gene synthesized that contains the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter and omega enhancer

introduced into pfret intb vectors to generate another nine vectors pfretgc _PROTEIN_ nc and nn pfretvr _PROTEIN_ nc and nn and pfrettv _PROTEIN_ nc and nn . all vectors were verified via restriction
