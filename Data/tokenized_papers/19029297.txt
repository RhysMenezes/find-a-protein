arsenite is highly toxic to _METHOD_ including plants . very recently transporters in rice responsible for as transport have been described proc . natl . acad . sci . u. s. a . but little is known about as tolerance . in this study three independent as tolerant mutants were isolated from ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenized seeds of arabidopsis thaliana . all three mutants carried independent mutations in nodulin like intrinsic protein _PROTEIN_ a homolog of an aquaporin . two independent transgenic lines carrying t dna in _PROTEIN_ were highly tolerant to as establishing that _PROTEIN_ is the causal gene of as tolerance . because an aquaglyceroporin is able to transport as we measured as transport activity . when _PROTEIN_ in xenopus oocytes _PROTEIN_ was capable of transporting as . as content in the mutant plants was lower than in wild type plants . promoter _PROTEIN_ and real time pcr analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ is highly _PROTEIN_ in roots and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . these data show that _PROTEIN_ is involved in as uptake into roots and that disruption of _PROTEIN_ function confers as tolerance to plants . _PROTEIN_ and closely related homologs of _PROTEIN_ were also permeable to as . although the disruption of these genes reduced the as content in plants as tolerance was not observed in _PROTEIN_ and mutants . this indicates that as tolerance can not be simply explained by _PROTEIN_ as contents in plants .
screening for as tolerant obtain insights into as tolerance _METHOD_ the _METHOD_ mutagenized population of a. thaliana was screened for as tolerant mutants . we chose as as the selection condition . at this concentration the root length of the wild type was of that of plants growing on the as minus medium after a day incubation . approximately seeds were sown onto half strength _METHOD_ medium containing as and grown vertically for days . plants with roots more than two times longer than the wild type were selected . after confirmation of the phenotype in the generation three independent mutants and were obtained . these were derived from independent batches of _METHOD_ mutagenized populations . these mutant roots were more than three times longer than those of the wild type in the presence of and as at which concentration the growth of wild type roots was strongly inhibited . the population from crosses between ler and mutants was sown onto medium containing as and segregated into tolerant weakly tolerant and sensitive phenotypes at a ratio of . the same phenotype was observed in the populations of and . these results indicate that the as tolerant phenotype is caused by a single mutation and the mutated alleles are all semidominant . identification of _PROTEIN_ as a causal gene for as speculated that aquaglyceroporins might be involved in as tolerance based on previous studies . among the mip family in plants some members of nodulin like intrinsic proteins which are classified as aquaglyceroporins in plants were shown to transport small neutral molecules including boric acid and silicic acid . as is also a small neutral molecule and we speculated that as tolerance may be due to mutation in a nip gene . in the a. thaliana genome there are nine nip genes and we obtained seven t dna insertion mutants of nips _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and examined their as tolerance . among nip mutants examined only _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ exhibited high tolerance to as . in contrast transgenic plants carrying t dna in _PROTEIN_ which is the most similar to _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ of amino acid sequences among the nip family members did not show as tolerance . similarly transgenic plants carrying t dna in which mediates boric acid uptake from soil also did not show as tolerance . furthermore which confers as tolerance did not confer strong tolerance in our experimental conditions . as shown in fig . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have t dna insertions in the third intron and the fifth exon respectively . the mrna accumulation level was very low or not detected in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively indicating that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are very strong and null alleles respectively . because _PROTEIN_ showed high tolerance to as _PROTEIN_ genomic sequences of the as tolerant mutants and were determined . all of the mutants had a single nucleotide substitution in _PROTEIN_ . lines and mutants had mutations in the third and second exons respectively . these mutations caused amino acid substitutions in the proteins to and to respectively . the line mutant had a mutation in the fourth exon/intron junction which resulted in a larger transcript than the wild type . the sequence analysis of the rt pcr product of indicated that the third intron was not spliced out . the third intron contains an in frame stop codon and the _PROTEIN_ transcript of the line is likely to produce a short and abnormal protein . to further confirm that _PROTEIN_ is the causal gene of as tolerance mapping analysis was carried out using population from crosses between ler and as tolerant mutants . markers on chromosome showed the strong linkage to as tolerance phenotype and the mutation was located between markers and . _PROTEIN_ is located in this interval further supporting that _PROTEIN_ is the causal gene of the phenotype . _PROTEIN_ transcript accumulation was at a similar level among col and . in _PROTEIN_ transcript accumulation was reduced to of that of col . taken together these results establish that _PROTEIN_ is the causal gene for as tolerant mutants and disruption of _PROTEIN_ function makes the plant tolerant to as . nips transport as _PROTEIN_ that disruption of _PROTEIN_ confers strong as tolerance suggests that _PROTEIN_ is an as transporter that mediates toxic as uptake into roots . to directly confirm the as transport activity of the protein we used a x. laevis oocyte _PROTEIN_ system . a time course experiment showed that oocytes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ accumulated several times more as than the control demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ is capable of transporting as . we also measured the transport activity of the mutant proteins corresponding to and lines . the content of as in oocytes _PROTEIN_ mutant proteins was similar to that of the water injected oocytes suggesting that all mutant proteins lost transport activity and that and are important amino acid residues for the protein to function as an as transporter . the lack of transport activity of the mutant alleles of _PROTEIN_ corresponded with the as tolerance phenotype of the mutant plants . we also measured the transport activity of _PROTEIN_ and in oocytes . as transport activity was detected in both proteins . as concentrations were reduced in nips examine the transport activity of nips in vivo we measured as concentrations in the nip mutants . the mutant plants were grown vertically on plates containing as for days and as content in whole seedlings was determined . as shown in fig . as concentrations in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and mutant plants were significantly lower than those in col plants . taken together with the oocyte experiment nips is active in as transport in plants . tissue specificity of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ identify tissue specificity of _PROTEIN_ in detail a _PROTEIN_ promoter region _PROTEIN_ was fused in frame with the gus _PROTEIN_ gene . four independent transgenic lines were generated and gus staining patterns were observed in the generation . gus staining was observed both in shoots and roots . the staining in leaves was observed mostly in stomata . the root hypocotyl junction especially in the root region showed strong gus activity . in roots the patterns differed between primary and _PROTEIN_ roots . in _PROTEIN_ roots both root tips and steles were stained whereas in primary roots steles but not root tips were stained . the pattern was consistent among the four lines . we also determined mrna accumulation in shoots and roots using real time pcr . the _PROTEIN_ mrna in roots was times higher than that in shoots . subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ identify the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant under the cauliflower mosaic virus rna promoter . about independent lines were generated and among these _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in lines . these lines were subjected to the as tolerance assay . ten lines showed as sensitive phenotypes and two of them were used . sensitive phenotypes of the transgenic lines imply a complementation of the _PROTEIN_ mutant suggesting that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in these lines was functional . we also generated the transgenic plants carrying _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct as well as plants carrying _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct under the control of the native _PROTEIN_ promoter . however no _METHOD_ was observed after checking more than lines for each constructs . subcellular localization of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed with a confocal laser scanning microscope and two lines showed a similar _METHOD_ pattern . in root tips _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in the cell periphery . this _METHOD_ pattern is different from that of tonoplast localized proteins . _LOCATION_ in cells near the root tips are observed as several vesicles . in the case of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ we never observed such vesicle patterns suggesting that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . after plasmolysis treatment the _METHOD_ mostly associated with _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ not with the cell walls further suggesting that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is localized to _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . interestingly the _METHOD_ was observed at the distal side of the epidermal cells . furthermore _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed only in outer cell layers even though it is driven by the promoter which is active in all cell layers in roots . it is likely that _PROTEIN_ transcript accumulation is differentially and post transcriptionally regulated in a cell type dependent manner .
