balancing repair and degradation is essential for _PROTEIN_ organellar and cellular homeostasis . _LOCATION_ are ubiquitous organelles in eukaryotic cells that play pivotal roles in cell survival . however the quality control mechanism used to _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ is unclear . here we demonstrate that lon protease _PROTEIN_ which is encoded by aberrant _LOCATION_ morphology _PROTEIN_ is responsible for the functional transition of _LOCATION_ with autophagy . the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ mutant displayed accelerated _LOCATION_ degradation and a dramatically reduced number of _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ deficiency caused enhanced _LOCATION_ degradation by autophagy and peroxisomal proteins accumulated in the _LOCATION_ due to a _PROTEIN_ in the number of _LOCATION_ . we also show the proteolytic consequence of _PROTEIN_ for the degradation of peroxisomal proteins and we demonstrated that unnecessary proteins are eliminated by _PROTEIN_ and autophagy dependent degradation pathways during the functional transition of _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ plays dual roles as an _PROTEIN_ dependent protease and a chaperone . we show that the chaperone domain of _PROTEIN_ is essential for the suppression of autophagy whereas its peptidase domain interferes with this chaperone function indicating that intramolecular modulation between the proteolysis and chaperone functions of _PROTEIN_ regulates degradation of _LOCATION_ by autophagy .
_LOCATION_ have specialized functions depending on the organism or organ and their functions _PROTEIN_ to environmental and developmental cues in plant cells . to better understand this process we previously isolated a number of _LOCATION_ mutants the apem mutants based on their different pattern of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ from that of the parent plant _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in which _METHOD_ _METHOD_ is observed as punctate peroxisomal signals in most cells . one apem mutant _PROTEIN_ showed a _PROTEIN_ of punctate _METHOD_ signals and accumulation of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ . these phenotypes were not observed in young tissues such as emerging new leaves and root tips but were observed in mature tissues including fully expanded leaves the upper parts of roots and root caps . in addition to week old _PROTEIN_ mutants contained enlarged _LOCATION_ whose maximum diameter was . the appearance of the _PROTEIN_ phenotype depended on the growth conditions nitrogen depletion caused severe _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ accumulation even in emerging new leaves and high _PROTEIN_ conditions _PROTEIN_ in which the photorespiratory pathway did not function suppressed the enlargement of _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ . enlarged _LOCATION_ frequently contained a region not visualized with _METHOD_ . electron microscopic observation showed that enlarged _LOCATION_ contained electron dense regions along the inner peroxisomal periphery and immunogold labeling with antibodies against _METHOD_ revealed that gold particles rarely localized to electron dense regions although they normally localized to non electron dense regions of _LOCATION_ which is in good agreement with the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ results . oxidized _LOCATION_ accumulate inactivated cat a peroxisomal enzyme and such aggregates are observed as electron dense regions . gold particles conjugated with antibodies against cat localized to electron dense regions indicating that abnormal cat accumulates in _PROTEIN_ . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ plays an important role in the number and morphology of _LOCATION_ . map based cloning identified the _PROTEIN_ locus between the _PROTEIN_ and bac clones on chromosome which contains predicted genes . we found a single nucleotide substitution of c to t in the fourth exon of _GENE_ which is annotated as lon protease _PROTEIN_ . this mutation causes the substitution of with a stop codon . a transformant harboring a genomic dna fragment bearing _GENE_ showed numerous punctate _METHOD_ _METHOD_ spots . this result demonstrates that _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ is sufficient to rescue the _PROTEIN_ phenotype . an progeny of a cross between _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion line showed _METHOD_ accumulation in the _LOCATION_ like _PROTEIN_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are allelic . these results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is _GENE_ . lon proteases belong to the aaa _PROTEIN_ superfamily and are found in bacteria and eukaryotic organelles . arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ has amino acid residues and is a typical lon protease which consists of a conserved lon n terminal domain an aaa _PROTEIN_ domain with typical walker a and b motifs and a peptidase domain at the c terminus . _PROTEIN_ has a c terminal tripeptide with skl as the canonical peroxisomal targeting signal _PROTEIN_ and a previous proteomic analysis has identified _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis _LOCATION_ . observation of transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ as a peroxisomal marker showed that _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected as punctate signals which merged with monomeric red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . this result is consistent with the data from proteomic analysis . we separated _LOCATION_ rich fractions by the subcellular fractionation method and subjected the fractions to immunoblot analysis . a peroxisomal protein hydroxypyruvate reductase _PROTEIN_ was detected _PROTEIN_ in the fraction with a small amount detected in the fraction . thus _LOCATION_ are considered to be accumulated _PROTEIN_ in the fraction . some _PROTEIN_ proteins such as _PROTEIN_ were detected in the fraction containing the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ because such proteins leaked from broken _LOCATION_ during organelle preparation . _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ detected in with a small amount detected in the and fractions . this _PROTEIN_ distribution pattern suggests that _PROTEIN_ is localized to _LOCATION_ confirming the _METHOD_ pattern of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . to examine the detailed suborganellar localization of _PROTEIN_ protein _LOCATION_ in the fraction were resuspended in low salt buffer high salt buffer and alkaline solution buffer . the peroxisomal _LOCATION_ protein _PROTEIN_ was found in the insoluble fraction even after treatment with alkaline solution . however the _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ was dissolved in low salt buffer high salt buffer and alkaline solution . _PROTEIN_ protein is insoluble in low salt buffer slightly soluble in high salt buffer and soluble in alkaline solution . in addition _PROTEIN_ in intact _LOCATION_ is sensitive to digestion with proteinase k in the presence of triton x . similarly _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein which is a peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ protein is degraded with a lower concentration of proteinase k in the presence of triton x . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is a peripheral _LOCATION_ protein which associates with the _LOCATION_ from the _PROTEIN_ side . to clarify whether _PROTEIN_ affects the accumulation of peroxisomal proteins we compared the accumulation levels of peroxisomal proteins in protein extracts from emerging new leaves vs. expanded leaves because the _PROTEIN_ phenotype became more noticeable as the tissues grew older . the amount of peroxisomal _LOCATION_ protein _PROTEIN_ long chain acyl coa synthetase _PROTEIN_ and peroxisomal _LOCATION_ protein _PROTEIN_ but not peroxisomal ascorbate peroxidase dramatically _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the _PROTEIN_ in peroxisomal _LOCATION_ protein levels was more pronounced in expanded leaves than in emerging leaves in _PROTEIN_ . however there was no significant difference in the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ the receptor required for peroxisomal protein import and peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ proteins _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ compared with wild type plants . in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ proteins in the _LOCATION_ were observed so it is possible that other _PROTEIN_ proteins also accumulate in the _LOCATION_ . in addition the low levels of peroxisomal _LOCATION_ proteins suggest a _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ number . therefore we performed indirect immunostaining using antibodies against papx to detect _LOCATION_ and/or _LOCATION_ ghosts . the results revealed that the number of vesicles labeled with papx antibodies _PROTEIN_ and papx signals were dispersed in the _LOCATION_ or in cellular compartments which may be subdomains of the rough _LOCATION_ . however the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was not lower in _PROTEIN_ than in the wt supporting the notion that the _PROTEIN_ in the amount of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant was caused by degradation of _LOCATION_ rather than by down regulation of gene _PROTEIN_ . these results along with the observation of the _PROTEIN_ in punctate _METHOD_ signals in the _PROTEIN_ mutant suggest that _LOCATION_ might be degraded in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . previous studies have shown that oxidized or excess _LOCATION_ are degraded by autophagy in yeast mammals and plants . to clarify whether the number of _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ is reduced by autophagy we generated a double mutant by crossing _PROTEIN_ with _LOCATION_ unusual positioning in which _LOCATION_ degradation is arrested due to the defect of autophagy related _PROTEIN_ . in the _PROTEIN_ double mutant _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ disappeared and the _LOCATION_ number increased compared with _PROTEIN_ . the aggregation of _LOCATION_ was frequently observed which also occurs in _LOCATION_ . as the _LOCATION_ number increased in the double mutant the amount of _PROTEIN_ also increased to the level of the wt . additionally growth arrest in _PROTEIN_ which was already reported in a previous study was rescued in the double mutant . mutants defective in autophagy related genes show an early senescence phenotype especially under nutrient deficient conditions . similarly the double mutant displayed early senescence in its rosette leaves indicating that autophagy is repressed in the double mutant . these results demonstrate that the _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ number is caused by accelerated _LOCATION_ degradation that occurs via autophagy . we then examined whether the _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ number is responsible for _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ accumulation in _PROTEIN_ . it was easy to assay the _PROTEIN_ phenotype in root cells because these cells exhibited various gradations of phenotype along the developmental lineage numerous _LOCATION_ remained in young cells near the root tip whereas the _LOCATION_ number was dramatically reduced in the upper cells of the root . fig . shows the border region where adjacent cells exhibiting each phenotype were observed . in this region cells containing numerous _LOCATION_ began to exhibit _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ accumulation over time . to reveal the relationship between autophagy and the shift in the _PROTEIN_ phenotype _PROTEIN_ seedlings were treated with the _LOCATION_ h _PROTEIN_ inhibitor concanamycin a which is used to detect autophagy since it inhibits the degradation of autophagic bodies in the _LOCATION_ . in cells of the phenotype shifting region of cona treated _PROTEIN_ roots _LOCATION_ like vesicles were detected in the _LOCATION_ . at this point dim _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in the _LOCATION_ revealing initiation of the accumulation of _METHOD_ protein in the _LOCATION_ . these results suggest that _LOCATION_ are degraded by autophagy before the cells exhibit _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . therefore _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein accumulates in the _LOCATION_ due to a lack of _LOCATION_ which could function as containers . during post germinative growth peroxisomal functions are rapidly exchanged . glyoxysomal enzymes required for lipid metabolism become less abundant and are substituted with leaf peroxisomal enzymes that contribute to photorespiration after the plant is exposed to light . during this functional transition degradation of glyoxysomal proteins occurs immediately . to analyze another aspect of _PROTEIN_ function we focused on the relationship among _PROTEIN_ functions autophagy and the peroxisomal functional transition of glyoxysomes to leaf _LOCATION_ . immunoblot analysis showed that glyoxysomal enzymes such as malate synthase _METHOD_ isocitrate lyase _PROTEIN_ and thiolase were highly accumulated in seedlings grown in continuous darkness and these enzymes were degraded after illumination in wt plants . the amount of the leaf peroxisomal enzyme _PROTEIN_ increased whereas illumination did not alter the amount of the _LOCATION_ protein _PROTEIN_ . in the _PROTEIN_ mutant the level of glyoxysomal proteins was lower than in wt plants even in the dark . this _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ may be caused by accelerated peroxisomal degradation by autophagy . in the _PROTEIN_ and mutants the amount of glyoxysomal and leaf peroxisomal proteins _PROTEIN_ and increased respectively which also occurred in wt plants . however _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ still remained in the _PROTEIN_ double mutant . aggregates of _LOCATION_ which contain oil bodies are present in mesophyll cells of etiolated cotyledons these aggregates disappeared and _LOCATION_ became present as independent vesicles after the functional transition . in _PROTEIN_ cotyledons the number of _LOCATION_ in the mesophyll cells _PROTEIN_ . in the and _PROTEIN_ mutants _LOCATION_ aggregates remained in the mesophyll cells indicating that clearance of these aggregates requires autophagy . these results implicate that glyoxysomal proteins are degraded by two independent degradation pathways i.e . the _PROTEIN_ and autophagy dependent pathways . in contrast to _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ thiolase was not degraded in the mutant indicating that thiolase is not a substrate of _PROTEIN_ and that it is degraded by autophagy during the peroxisomal functional transition . lon proteases play roles as multifunctional enzymes and contribute to the degradation of oxidized and damaged proteins in bacteria and organelles in eukaryotic cells . moreover the aaa _PROTEIN_ domain which probably functions with the n terminal domain provides the mechanical power needed to unfold substrate proteins thus lon proteins act as a molecular chaperone . to investigate which domain in _PROTEIN_ is essential for its function . we generated two mutant _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ containing amino acid substitutions to alanine _PROTEIN_ and to alanine _PROTEIN_ . is present in the _PROTEIN_ binding site of the walker a motif of the aaa _PROTEIN_ domain and the mutation is expected to arrest the binding of _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ . is a conserved residue at the active center of the peptidase domain in which the substitution of by alanine inactivates peptidase activity . two mutated and wt _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ constructs were _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter . lines _PROTEIN_ adequate amounts of _PROTEIN_ protein were selected for further analysis . in _PROTEIN_ transformed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in _LOCATION_ and not in the _LOCATION_ which was also observed in wt plants . interestingly the introduction of _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ was able to rescue the _PROTEIN_ phenotype . in addition the number of _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was higher than that of wt plants . during the functional transition in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the glyoxysomal proteins _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and thiolase accumulated as they had in the _PROTEIN_ double mutant and the _LOCATION_ aggregates remained in the mesophyll cells . in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the changes in the amounts of glyoxysomal and leaf peroxisomal proteins were similar to those in _PROTEIN_ and the number of _LOCATION_ in the mesophyll cells was reduced as in _PROTEIN_ . these results indicate that the suppression of _LOCATION_ degradation by autophagy requires the chaperone domain but not the peptidase domain . notably the number of _LOCATION_ in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants was higher than that in wt plants in both rosette leaves and greening cotyledons and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ shows accumulation of glyoxysomal proteins like the _PROTEIN_ double mutant after illumination . these results indicate that the peptidase domain of _PROTEIN_ reduced the effect of the chaperone function on the suppression of autophagy .
the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants and the _PROTEIN_ mutant were derived from the columbia background . the knockout line containing a t dna insertion in the _GENE_ locus _PROTEIN_ was obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center _PROTEIN_ . to examine the relationship between its phenotype and genotype the presence of the t dna insertion was confirmed by pcr using gene specific primers with the t dna specific lb primer . all seeds were surface sterilized in naclo triton x and germinated on growth medium containing mg murashige and skoog salts mes koh and agar with or without sucrose . germination was induced by incubating the seeds for h at and then transferring them to under continuous light . since the _PROTEIN_ mutant showed severe germination defects all seed coats were nicked to accelerate seed coat rupturing . tissues from plants were examined using an _PROTEIN_ confocal laser scanning microscope as previously described . z projection images of mesophyll cells in fig . were produced using the following steps . first a z stack image comprising five slices was produced . the first slice was obtained showing the top surface of the epidermal cells and the other slices were obtained using steps from the first slice . to produce an image of the mesophyll cells the third to fifth images were used for z projection with maximum intensity projection using imagej software _PROTEIN_ since the first and second slices contained signals from epidermal cells . the _PROTEIN_ mutant which was backcrossed three times with the parental _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic plant was crossed with another accession landsberg _LOCATION_ to produce and subsequently progeny . a total of progeny _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ phenotype were scored according to their genetic background as determined using a series of cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence and simple sequence length polymorphism markers . rough mapping showed the location of the _PROTEIN_ locus between the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ markers on chromosome . several sets of caps and sslp markers were used for fine mapping according to sequences available in the monsanto arabidopsis polymorphism collection and naramap markers which were kindly provided by m. tasaka and m. morita at the nara institute of science and technology . fine mapping identified the _PROTEIN_ locus between the _PROTEIN_ and bac clones which contains predicted genes . the nucleotide substitution in _GENE_ revealed it to be a possible candidate for the _PROTEIN_ gene . to confirm that the correct gene was identified the _PROTEIN_ genomic fragment which included a kb upstream region and a kb downstream region was cloned into using specific primers and the insert was transferred into the binary vector using the gateway lr recombination method . the construct was transformed into agrobacterium tumefaciens strain and then introduced into _PROTEIN_ plants using the floral dip method . the _PROTEIN_ cdna fragments which were conjugated with and sequences at their and ends respectively were amplified by pcr with gene specific primer sets and cloned into the entry vector using the gateway _PROTEIN_ recombination method . _PROTEIN_ cdna clones containing the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations were prepared by pcr based site directed mutagenesis with pfu turbo dna polymerase and the specific primer set . the _PROTEIN_ promoter which included a kb upstream region and start codon was cloned into entry vector pdonr using specific primers to generate . for complementation analysis of _PROTEIN_ each _PROTEIN_ cdna fragment _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which was cloned into was transferred into the destination vector with to generate binary vectors _PROTEIN_ modified _PROTEIN_ cdnas under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter . the construct was transformed into a. tumefaciens strain and then introduced into _PROTEIN_ plants using the floral dip method . to extract total proteins arabidopsis seedlings were homogenized with extraction buffer containing mm tris hcl ph mercaptoethanol _PROTEIN_ and glycerol . the homogenates were centrifuged at g for min at and the supernatants were collected . the concentration of extracted proteins was estimated using a protein assay kit with bovine albumin as a standard . the proteins were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride _LOCATION_ in a semi dry electroblotting system . immunodetection was performed on the _LOCATION_ using rabbit antibodies raised against _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ papx _PROTEIN_ cat _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ thiolase and _METHOD_ and immunoreactive bands were detected by monitoring the activity of a horseradish peroxidase conjugated antibody against rabbit igg . leaves from week old plants were analyzed as described previously . an antibody against papx and the secondary antibody conjugated anti rabbit igg were used . to separate the _LOCATION_ rich fractions the subcellular fractionation method was performed according to citation with several modifications . briefly week old seedlings were chopped with a razor blade in a petri dish on ice in ml of chopping buffer containing mm hepes naoh mm edta and m sucrose . the homogenate was filtered through a cell strainer with brief centrifugation . an aliquot of the filtrate was used as the total fraction . a ml aliquot of the filtrate was centrifuged at g at for min . the pellet was resuspended in ml of chopping buffer and was designated as the fraction . the supernatant was centrifuged again at g at for min . the pellet was resuspended in ml of chopping buffer and was designated as the fraction . the supernatant was ultracentrifuged at g at for h. the pellet was resuspended in ml of chopping buffer and was designated as the fraction and the supernatant was designated as the fraction . each fraction was subjected to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the relative distribution of peroxisomal proteins in each fraction was compared using immunoblot analysis with specific antibodies against _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was detected in the and fractions . therefore the and fractions were used as the _LOCATION_ rich fractions . the filtrated homogenates were centrifuged at g at for min and the pellet was designated as the fraction . _LOCATION_ in the fraction were resuspended in either low salt buffer high salt buffer or alkaline buffer for h at and the solution was then centrifuged at g at for min to separate it into the supernatant and pellet . in some experiments _LOCATION_ in the fraction were incubated with chopping buffer containing an appropriate concentration of proteinase k for min at in the presence or absence of triton x . the reactions were terminated by the addition of mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride . immunocytochemical procedures were essentially as described previously . the leaves of week old plants containing enlarged _LOCATION_ were screened using _METHOD_ microscopy and employed as a sample . an antibody against _METHOD_ and cat as well as igg gold were used in this experiment . sequence data from this article can be found in the genbank/embl data libraries under the following accession numbers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the genbank accession number for the knockout line described in this article is _PROTEIN_ .
