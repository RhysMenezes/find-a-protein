stresses leading to the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ elicit a highly conserved _LOCATION_ stress response in plants called the unfolded protein response . while the response itself is well documented in plants the components of the signaling pathway are less well known . we have identified three _LOCATION_ associated basic domain/leucine zipper _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis thaliana that are candidates for _LOCATION_ stress sensors/transducers . one of these _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ an _LOCATION_ resident transcription _PROTEIN_ is activated in response to treatment by tunicamycin an agent that blocks n linked protein glycosylation . following tm treatment _PROTEIN_ is processed releasing its n terminal cytoplasm facing domain which is translocated to the _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ of a truncated form of _PROTEIN_ containing only the cytoplasmic domain of the protein upregulated the _PROTEIN_ of _LOCATION_ stress response genes in the absence of stress conditions . thus _PROTEIN_ serves as a sensor/transducer in arabidopsis to mediate _LOCATION_ stress responses related to upr .
in a previous study we searched the arabidopsis genome for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with predicted structures similar to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . three candidate genes were identified _PROTEIN_ and . we focused on _PROTEIN_ because we found in another study that _PROTEIN_ is associated with salt stress signaling . also _PROTEIN_ was accessible because of the availability of t dna insertion mutations _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . both appeared to be full knockouts of _PROTEIN_ . to monitor _LOCATION_ stress we measured the levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by quantitative rt pcr following treatment with tm . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations reduced _PROTEIN_ and upregulation at h following tm treatment however _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in particular recovered somewhat by h . _PROTEIN_ stages of the response _PROTEIN_ may involve alternative pathways such as that mediated by at _PROTEIN_ . similar observations have been made in mammalian cells in which _PROTEIN_ responses are delayed with respect to _PROTEIN_ responses . nonetheless _PROTEIN_ appears to function in tm induced _LOCATION_ stress signaling in arabidopsis and appears to be more involved in the early phases of the response . to confirm that the t dna insertion in _PROTEIN_ was in _PROTEIN_ responsible for the _PROTEIN_ mutation we backcrossed _PROTEIN_ mutants to the wild type and found by genotyping progeny that the t dna insert segregated approximately in a ratio . the ratio was somewhat distorted by the underrecovery of homozygotes nonetheless several homozygous lines were grouped tested and found to be defective for tm induced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . unlike _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ of endogenous _PROTEIN_ was not induced by tm treatment . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ is processed in response to _LOCATION_ stress the protein was myc tagged at its n terminus and myc _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in transgenic seedlings . prior to tm treatment three bands reacting with the anti myc antibody appeared in immunoblots of extracts and . we reasoned that was a glycosylated form of myc _PROTEIN_ because was converted to when extracts were treated with n acetylglucosaminidase h . is about the predicted size for full length myc _PROTEIN_ . appears to be largely made up of a truncated form of myc _PROTEIN_ and a minor amount of an endogenous protein that is present in the untransformed plant that cross reacts with the anti myc antibody . the component of derived from myc _PROTEIN_ is glycosylated because it shifts giving rise to following endoh treatment . the nonglycosylated endogenous protein component is fairly faint and can not be detected in certain cases . following tm treatment of myc _PROTEIN_ seedlings three new bands appeared and the nonglycosylated _METHOD_ of myc _PROTEIN_ and truncated myc _PROTEIN_ respectively and _PROTEIN_ . is not n glycosylated therefore we considered to be the n terminal component of the proteolytic processed form of . is about the size of a protein cleaved at the _LOCATION_ face of the tmd at the site . we did not find a form that might represent _PROTEIN_ cleavage alone . citation made a similar observation on the processing of _PROTEIN_ in mammalian cells . they could only detect an _PROTEIN_ processing intermediate in a mutant and from that they argued that processing occurs so quickly following _PROTEIN_ cleavage that the intermediate is too short lived to detect . one anomaly in these observations was the low levels of the precursor relative to product in these experiments . some of that may be due to less efficient transfer of a larger protein from the gel to the protein gel blot however it is also possible that the precursor is less stable than the product and may turnover in the secretory pathway . we observed the same phenomenon in the processing of myc _PROTEIN_ following salt stress . therefore the possibility that the precursor turns over under nonstressed conditions is under examination . we conclude that new _METHOD_ of myc _PROTEIN_ appear in seedlings upon tm treatment including a nonglycosylated precursor form that results from tm blocking glycosylation and a form representing the n terminal or cytoplasm facing domain of myc _PROTEIN_ that presumably arises by _PROTEIN_ cleavage and further processing at the site . if the tm induced stress signaling pathway in arabidopsis operates at a cellular level similar to yeast or mammalian cells then at _PROTEIN_ should reside in the _LOCATION_ under unstressed conditions and the n terminal component should relocate to the _LOCATION_ following stress . the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ was determined using a construct in which modified green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ was fused to the n terminus of the protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . under normal conditions most _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in transfected arabidopsis protoplasts was located in the cytoplasm and perinuclear region largely colocalizing with an _LOCATION_ marker . likewise _METHOD_ _METHOD_ colocalized with another _LOCATION_ marker _LOCATION_ tracker aminoethyl sulfonamide in intact roots of transgenic seedlings . under tm induced stress conditions _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ largely localized in _LOCATION_ although much of the _METHOD_ remained in the cytoplasm . we interpret this to mean that _PROTEIN_ is processed under stress conditions and the n terminal domain relocates from the _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ . the _PROTEIN_ that not all of the _METHOD_ relocates to the _LOCATION_ may be due to the _PROTEIN_ that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is overexpressed in these cells . to demonstrate that correct processing of the _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ occurs root extracts from untreated and tm treated plants were analyzed by protein gel blots using an anti _METHOD_ antibody . the results were comparable to the myc tagged constructs in that the major cleavage product was the fusion between _METHOD_ and the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ cut at the putative site . since no free _METHOD_ was detected we conclude that the likely form of _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ is the _METHOD_ fusion and not free _METHOD_ . since upregulation of bip genes occurs within a few hours of tm treatment we examined the time course for the _LOCATION_ relocation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ began to concentrate in some _LOCATION_ by h and to more _LOCATION_ by h . in _PROTEIN_ about as much _METHOD_ had relocated to _LOCATION_ by h as had during overnight incubation . thus the time course for _LOCATION_ translocation of the n terminal component correlates closely with the kinetics of upregulation of bip genes . it was difficult to determine from these experiments whether _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transits through the _LOCATION_ prior to its relocation to the _LOCATION_ . we have seen some _METHOD_ in particulate structures at the h time point however further studies are under way to determine the subcellular localization of that _METHOD_ signal . since there are three arabidopsis genes that encode _PROTEIN_ proteins with features similar to _PROTEIN_ this begs the question whether responses to different stressors are mediated by different _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we demonstrated in another study that _PROTEIN_ functions in salt stress . in this study we asked whether _PROTEIN_ was processed in response to salt stress in the same way it was after tm treatment . as before we observed that after tm treatment myc _PROTEIN_ was processed in vivo yielding an n terminal fragment cut at the presumed cleavage site . we did not observe myc _PROTEIN_ processing and the appearance of under salt stress . however treatment with another _LOCATION_ stress agent dtt resulted in myc _PROTEIN_ processing . dtt is thought to interfere with cys bridge formation and the proper folding of _LOCATION_ proteins . we did not observe the appearance of or in response to salt or dtt stress because these two species are nonglycosylated proteins that only accumulate when n linked glycosylation is inhibited by tm . thus we conclude from the above that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are involved in different _LOCATION_ stress responses and that _PROTEIN_ is recruited in response to stress elicited by conventional upr stress agents tm or dtt . other laboratories have profiled gene _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis following treatment with _LOCATION_ stress agents . citation showed that genes encoding chaperones such as bip and dependent _LOCATION_ folding protein were prominent among the upregulated genes . a prediction from the hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ processing mediates tm induced _LOCATION_ stress responses is that _PROTEIN_ of a truncated form of the protein without the transmembrane and c terminal domain should constitutively activate the _PROTEIN_ of _LOCATION_ stress response genes . the prediction was tested by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in a wild type background driven by the promoter and comparing the gene _PROTEIN_ patterns to the empty vector in the same background . transgenic lines with modest overexpression levels were recovered . it was found that _PROTEIN_ and and several other _LOCATION_ folding enzyme genes were indeed upregulated in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines without any _LOCATION_ stress inducer . thus _PROTEIN_ of the nonmembrane anchored form of _PROTEIN_ is sufficient to upregulate _LOCATION_ stress response genes and mimics the condition of tm induced _LOCATION_ stress with respect to the _PROTEIN_ of these key marker genes . constitutive _PROTEIN_ of the truncated form of _PROTEIN_ delayed growth of seedlings as might be expected for plants responding to stress conditions . however mature transgenic and nontransgenic plants had similar form and stature .
