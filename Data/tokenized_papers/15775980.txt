su like histone methyltransferases control heterochromatic domains in eukaryotes . in arabidopsis suvh genes encode su homologues where _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ represent distinct subgroups of suvh genes . loss of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ causes weak reduction of heterochromatic histone dimethylation whereas in _PROTEIN_ null plants and dimethyl and dimethyl and monomethyl the histone methylation marks of arabidopsis heterochromatin are significantly reduced . like animal su proteins _PROTEIN_ displays strong effects . loss of function suppresses whereas overexpression enhances gene silencing causes ectopic heterochromatization and significant growth defects . furthermore modification of transgene silencing by _PROTEIN_ is partially transmitted to the offspring plants . this epigenetic stability correlates with heritable changes in dna methylation . mutational dissection of _PROTEIN_ indicates an implication of its and ydg domain in directing dna methylation to target sequences a prerequisite for consecutive histone methylation . gene silencing by _PROTEIN_ depends on _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ . in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ with its histone and methylation activity has a central role in heterochromatic gene silencing .
the su proteins control repressive chromatin structures by histone methylation . in contrast to animals and fungi which have one or two su homologues in arabidopsis suvh genes encode su homologous proteins . tree reconstruction of suvh protein sequences from different plant species results in four clearly distinct subgroups of suvh proteins in _METHOD_ . branching of both moss and fern suvh fragments at the root of the angiosperm suvh subgroups argues for a phylogenetic split of suvh genes during early evolution of seed plants . the _PROTEIN_ genes are more distant to all groups of suvh genes . only _PROTEIN_ genes contain introns and retrotransposition might have been involved in evolution of the different suvh gene families . branching of gymnosperm with the _PROTEIN_ subgroup suggests that functional differentiation of suvh proteins had already occurred before the angiosperm gymnosperm split . to identify chromatin targets of the arabidopsis su homologues _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins we studied their _LOCATION_ distribution in transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ myc or _METHOD_ fusion proteins . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins associate with the dapi bright regions of interphase _LOCATION_ which represent pericentromeric heterochromatin in arabidopsis . we also tested _LOCATION_ distribution of the drosophila su and heterochromatin proteins in arabidopsis . the drosophila proteins in arabidopsis also associate with heterochromatin indicating conserved _METHOD_ of heterochromatin association of these proteins in plants and animals . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins are both heterochromatin associated and could comprise redundant functions . alternatively these proteins could control distinct heterochromatic histone methylation marks as well as their combinatorial interplay . we analysed the effect of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ on heterochromatic histone and methylation marks using specific histone methylation antibodies . in these studies we used insertion mutations or antisense lines . none of the insertional mutations or the antisense lines show a significant phenotypic defect in homozygous constitution . arabidopsis heterochromatin is enriched in methylated dna and and dimethylated histone . other heterochromatic histone methylation marks in arabidopsis are and dimethyl and monomethyl . in contrast trimethyl trimethyl and and trimethyl are found together with methylated and _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis euchromatin . in our studies mutations of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ appear to show only weak reduction of and dimethyl in pericentromeric heterochromatin . in contrast _PROTEIN_ mutations strongly reduce all histone and dna methylation marks . the most dramatic effect of _PROTEIN_ is on monomethylation . reduction of dna methylation at heterochromatic sequences in _PROTEIN_ null plants was further quantified by bisulphite sequence analysis of athila transposons . in vitro analysis shows that _PROTEIN_ is a hmtase and methylates histone and in recombinant nucleosomes . drosophila su is a and modifier of heterochromatic gene silencing . in order to study the effects of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we constructed transgenes with the promotor or used a _PROTEIN_ transcriptional system which allows controlled induction of gene _PROTEIN_ by dexamethasone treatment . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ has no significant effect on pericentromeric heterochromatin and the protein remains heterochromatin associated . in contrast after overexpression _PROTEIN_ shows dispersed _LOCATION_ distribution resulting in ectopic heterochromatization . by electron microscopic analysis additional blocks of heterochromatic material can be detected . immunocytological analysis of _PROTEIN_ overexpression plants reveals a significant increase in and dimethyl and dimethyl and monomethyl as well as cytosine methylation . we have quantified the effects of _PROTEIN_ on five histone methylation marks by western analysis of bulk histones . in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants heterochromatic and dimethylation monomethylation and monomethylation are significantly reduced whereas _PROTEIN_ overexpression causes enhancement of dimethylation and monomethylation . in contrast trimethylation of which is a euchromatic histone methylation mark in arabidopsis is significantly reduced after _PROTEIN_ overexpression . significant reduction in immunostaining for other euchromatic histone modification marks like dimethyl acetyl and trimethyl is also found in _PROTEIN_ overexpression plants . none of the overexpression lines nor the _METHOD_ lines after dexamethasone treatment show any phenotypic defects . in contrast four of independent transgenic lines show significant growth reduction and a curled cotyledon phenotype . western blot analysis shows direct correlation between the extent of _PROTEIN_ overexpression and the strength of growth defects . line with lower amount of additional _PROTEIN_ is only weakly affected whereas the three lines and with higher amount of _PROTEIN_ manifest a strong phenotype . similarly the _METHOD_ lines manifest a phenotype only after dexamethasone treatment . significant rescue of _PROTEIN_ overexpression phenotypes is found in _PROTEIN_ plants by introducing a _PROTEIN_ null allele . for functional dissection of _PROTEIN_ we isolated mutations within the transgene after _METHOD_ mutagenesis . these mutations were identified as dominant suppressors of the curled cotyledon phenotype in seedlings . all confirmed dominant suppressors rescued the growth defect . in two classes of mutant lines could be established . in lines the suppressor mutation and the _PROTEIN_ transgene segregate independently whereas in lines complete linkage is found . the latter class represents transgene mutations and we studied the functional consequence of seven such mutations . all are missense mutations located either in the the ydg or the _PROTEIN_ domain of _PROTEIN_ . only the mutation interferes with ectopic _LOCATION_ distribution of _PROTEIN_ . mutations and located in the ydg domain and the region between the ydg domain and the preset region respectively cause loss of ectopic dimethylation and monomethylation although ectopic distribution of _PROTEIN_ is not affected . mutations in the _PROTEIN_ domain eliminate ectopic and methylation but leave ectopic dna methylation unaffected . in order to study _PROTEIN_ overexpression effects on heterochromatic silencing of endogenous sequences we analysed _PROTEIN_ of athila transposons . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ causes strong repression of athila whereas all _PROTEIN_ transgene mutations rescue this silencing effect . immunocytological and bisulphite sequence analysis shows that none of the _PROTEIN_ domain mutations reduce dna hypermethylation at athila although its silencing is released . taken together our mutant analysis resolves a sequence of molecular events connected with _PROTEIN_ heterochromatic gene silencing . mutation indicates a possible role of the _PROTEIN_ in target sequences recognition whereas the ydg domain region appears to be involved in directing dna methylation to these sequences . dna methylation alone is not sufficient for silencing but rather functions as a mark directing _PROTEIN_ histone methylation to sequences subjected to silencing . moreover our data suggest that _PROTEIN_ dna methylation precedes histone methylation . to study effects of suvh proteins on tgs we used a new type of transgene constructs that contain four tandem copies of the luciferase gene . the transgene shows moderate luciferase silencing which is significantly enhanced by _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ overexpression . significant enhancement of tgs is already found in crosses with the line showing only weak growth defects indicating that tgs is already efficiently enhanced by low levels of _PROTEIN_ overexpression . the effect of _PROTEIN_ on tgs was studied using a specific antisense line . out of independent antisense lines we selected line _PROTEIN_ causing complete elimination of _PROTEIN_ transcript whereas other tested suvh genes are not affected . after a cross of _PROTEIN_ with homozygous plants all _PROTEIN_ offspring show strong suppression of tgs . significant suppressor effects are also seen with antisense lines only partially eliminating the _PROTEIN_ transcript . our experiments reveal the modifier effect of _PROTEIN_ on tgs . overexpression enhances whereas suppresses tgs . we further studied the epigenetic stability of _PROTEIN_ modified transgene silencing in progeny plants lacking _PROTEIN_ overexpression or antisense constructs which were generated by a backcross of the progeny with plants . partial epigenetic stability of modified transgene silencing is found in the offspring plants for the enhanced as well as suppressed state of . reciprocal crosses produced identical results . reversion to the level typical for control plants is found in offspring of the second backcross generation . to study whether epigenetic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ tgs is based on stable transmission of changes in dna methylation we performed bisulphite sequence analysis of the transgene . in plants produced by the first backcross to wild type the transgene inherited either from _PROTEIN_ overexpression or _PROTEIN_ antisense plants still shows increased and _PROTEIN_ dna methylation respectively . the data suggest that dna methylation is involved in _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ epigenetic effects . we analysed the effect of _PROTEIN_ on dna methylation at the transgene gus transgene repeats and athila transposon sequences . all these sequences show already in a consistent amount of dna methylation . in our studies we compared cpnpn nonsymmetric with cpg and cpnpg symmetric dna methylation . loss or overexpression of _PROTEIN_ affects both symmetrical and nonsymmetrical dna methylation at all studied sequences . in _PROTEIN_ mutant as well as _PROTEIN_ antisense plants strongest reduction of nonsymmetrical methylation at cpc is observed . since dna methylase _PROTEIN_ is suggested to function in _PROTEIN_ of cytosine methylation we studied at the completely silenced transgene the effects of a newly isolated strong _PROTEIN_ mutation on _PROTEIN_ transgene silencing . furthermore we also studied interaction between _PROTEIN_ and a newly isolated strong _PROTEIN_ chromomethylase mutation . in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants silencing of the transgene is significantly released . transgene silencing is differentially affected in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants . the suppressor effect of _PROTEIN_ dominates the enhancer effect of _PROTEIN_ overexpression whereas the enhancer effect of _PROTEIN_ dominates the suppressor effect of _PROTEIN_ . these results demonstrate that transgene silencing by _PROTEIN_ depends on _PROTEIN_ but not significantly on _PROTEIN_ . in addition to dna methylases the _PROTEIN_ protein which shows homology to the family of chromatin remodelling _PROTEIN_ controls dna methylation independent of their sequence context . in _PROTEIN_ plants the phenotype caused by _PROTEIN_ overexpression as well as ectopic dimethyl monomethyl and are all significantly suppressed . our results suggest that the function of _PROTEIN_ in heterochromatin formation and gene silencing depends on both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . genetic interaction of _PROTEIN_ with different silencing _PROTEIN_ also demonstrate that the _PROTEIN_ overexpression phenotypes allow systematic genetic dissection of functions involved in the control of heterochromatic gene silencing in arabidopsis .
