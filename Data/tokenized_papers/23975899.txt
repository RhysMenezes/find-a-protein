clathrin mediated endocytosis regulates many aspects of plant development including hormone signaling and responses to environmental stresses . despite the importance of this process the machinery that regulates cme in plants is largely unknown . in mammals the heterotetrameric _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ is required for the formation of clathrin coated vesicles at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . although the existence of ap has been predicted in arabidopsis thaliana the biochemistry and functionality of the complex is still uncharacterized . here we identified all the subunits of the arabidopsis ap by tandem affinity purification and found that one of the large ap subunits _PROTEIN_ localized at the pm and interacted with clathrin . furthermore endocytosis of the leucine rich repeat receptor kinase brassinosteroid _PROTEIN_ was shown to depend on ap . knockdown of the two arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ genes or overexpression of a dominant negative version of the medium ap subunit _PROTEIN_ impaired _PROTEIN_ endocytosis and enhanced the brassinosteroid signaling . our data reveal that the cme machinery in arabidopsis is evolutionarily conserved and that ap functions in receptor mediated endocytosis .
previously we had shown that a clathrin function was required for the internalization of the br receptor _PROTEIN_ . to corroborate this observation we performed colocalization experiments in epidermal cells of the arabidopsis root meristem that coexpressed the fusion proteins _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ light _PROTEIN_ mcherry . in agreement with the reported cme of the receptor _PROTEIN_ colocalized with _PROTEIN_ at the pm and in _PROTEIN_ mcherry positive endosomes that had been found previously to be _PROTEIN_ trans _LOCATION_ network /early endosome compartments . additionally coimmunoprecipitation experiments with arabidopsis seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ probed with anti clathrin heavy chain antibodies revealed that clathrin and _PROTEIN_ interacted . the occurrence of _PROTEIN_ and clathrin together in the endomembrane system supports the cme model for _PROTEIN_ internalization . despite the evidence that _PROTEIN_ undergoes cme studies of this mechanism are limited by the poor knowledge of the cme machinery in plants . as clathrin does not bind pm cargos directly we speculate that similar to the mammalian cme model the ap complex might mediate this interaction . in support of this hypothesis _PROTEIN_ one of the two putative arabidopsis ap large subunits was used to isolate the ap complex from psb d arabidopsis cell suspension cultures . in tap experiments _PROTEIN_ was fused to a g protein and a streptavidin binding peptide tag at its c or n terminus and was produced under a cauliflower mosaic virus promoter in arabidopsis cell cultures . a complex comprising _PROTEIN_ and five additional proteins was isolated repeatedly and independently of the tag position . four of the identified proteins namely _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ had been predicted to be part of the ap complex in arabidopsis inferred from homology to their mammalian counterparts . additionally in two of the four purifications a putative _PROTEIN_ binding protein was identified as well . the interactions found via the tap technology were reconfirmed by bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation . the ap subunits were fused to the c terminal or n terminal fragments of the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and produced transiently in the leaf epidermis of nicotiana benthamiana . the combined transformation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ resulted in _METHOD_ signals at the pm indicating that the two proteins interacted whereas no interaction was found between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ or between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in any of the combinations tested . in mammals ap functions in conjunction with clathrin . as none of the clathrin _METHOD_ were retrieved in the tap experiments we tested whether ap interacted with clathrin in vivo by performing coimmunoprecipitation experiments in arabidopsis seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . protein gel blot analysis with an antibody directed against the two _PROTEIN_ proteins revealed that _PROTEIN_ coimmunoprecipitated with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . additional bifc experiments validated that _PROTEIN_ and clathrin _PROTEIN_ interacted with a _METHOD_ signal localized at the pm in agreement with the coimmunoprecipitation data . in summary the biochemical experiments confirm the predicted composition of the ap core complex in arabidopsis and directly link this complex with clathrin reinforcing the hypothesis that ap is part of the cme machinery in plants . in mammals ap mediates endocytosis from the pm . to assess where ap functions in the cell we studied the ap localization in arabidopsis plants stably transformed with the large subunit _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ under the control of the camv promoter . confocal microscopy imaging of epidermal cells of the arabidopsis root meristem revealed that besides a faint cytoplasmic distribution both the c and n terminal _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions mostly localized at the pm in a discontinuous fashion . to exclude the possibility that the cellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was influenced by the fusion protein levels we selected two independent transgenic lines and analyzed the transcription of the transgene by quantitative real time pcr . in both lines the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was slightly higher or comparable to that of the endogenous _PROTEIN_ gene namely and fold for lines and respectively . the intact _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was also detected in both lines via protein gel blot analysis after immunoprecipitation with anti _METHOD_ antibodies . only the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line was used hereafter . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ colocalized with the lypophilic dye n phenyl hexatrienyl pyridinium dibromide and _PROTEIN_ mcherry at the pm but _PROTEIN_ was found neither in _PROTEIN_ positive endosomes nor in stained endosomal compartments . next we investigated the possible role of ap in endocytosis by interfering with several of its subunits through both pharmacological and genetic approaches . pharmacological inhibitors of endocytosis such as wortmannin tyrphostin and to a minor extent brefeldin a dislodged _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ from the pm in epidermal cells of arabidopsis roots implying that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization at this compartment is required for endocytosis . washout experiments restored the recruitment of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ indicating that the treatments did not interfere with the cell viability . to assess whether ap functions in endocytosis we generated a genetic knockdown of _PROTEIN_ by constitutively _PROTEIN_ an rna interference construct _PROTEIN_ that targeted the two arabidopsis tandem duplicated genes encoding _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . additionally a dominant negative version of the medium _PROTEIN_ subunit designated _PROTEIN_ was generated by deleting the c terminal region responsible for the cargo binding . the _PROTEIN_ construct was _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis under an inducible promoter . in d old arabidopsis seedlings that constitutively or conditionally _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ rnai or the _PROTEIN_ respectively the _PROTEIN_ root was shorter than that of the wild type . both ap knockdown lines had a _PROTEIN_ uptake of the endocytic tracer in root epidermal cells analyzed by the number of labeled endosomes . the dominant negative effect of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was not limited to because the clathrin dependent accumulation of another pm cargo the auxin transporter _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in bfa bodies was also reduced in the _PROTEIN_ lines . in summary the endocytic defects observed after targeting of the functionality of different ap subunits strongly suggests that this complex plays a general role in endocytic events in plants . given the role played by ap in the cme of pm receptor cargos in mammals and the similarities between the arabidopsis ap and its mammalian counterpart we evaluated whether ap mediated the endocytosis of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ colocalized with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at the pm in agreement with the reported receptor cme . interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was also detected by coimmunoprecipitation in arabidopsis seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ as revealed by protein gel blot analysis with an anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . similarly _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were coimmunoprecipitated in the presence of either brassinolide or after incubation of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants with the br synthesis inhibitor brassinazole to deplete the endogenous ligand . pretreatment with brassinazole followed by application of bl to activate the pm pool of _PROTEIN_ only led to similar results . likewise the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and chc was not influenced by the availability of brs . thus the recruitment of _PROTEIN_ into ap mediated endocytic processes is independent of its activation status . the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ strongly implied an ap dependent internalization of _PROTEIN_ . as the _PROTEIN_ endocytosis can be followed by the internalization of _METHOD_ labeled br alexa fluor castasterone we analyzed the uptake of afcs in root epidermal cells of arabidopsis seedlings that _PROTEIN_ either the _PROTEIN_ or the _PROTEIN_ rnai constructs by quantifying the _LOCATION_ accumulation of the dye after a chase of min . afcs endocytosis was lower in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells than that in the control . similarly the constitutive _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ rnai _PROTEIN_ the uptake of afcs to of the wild type levels suggesting that a functional ap is required for the _PROTEIN_ cme . these results were corroborated by introducing the dominant negative _PROTEIN_ construct into _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis plants and monitoring the _PROTEIN_ endocytosis in the presence of the recycling inhibitor bfa . inducible _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ partially _PROTEIN_ the endosomal pool of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in epidermal cells of arabidopsis roots and significantly reduced the size of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labeled bfa bodies denoting an impaired protein trafficking from the pm . in plants endocytosis of pm receptors has been linked to the regulation of their signaling activity . previously inhibition of _PROTEIN_ endocytosis at the pm had been shown to enhance br signaling monitored by the phosphorylation status of the key br transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ /brassinazole _PROTEIN_ . protein gel blot analysis of total protein extracts of excised arabidopsis roots after induction of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ revealed that _PROTEIN_ was dephosphorylated hinting at an enhanced br signaling . this result was validated by a qrt pcr analysis of the _PROTEIN_ of the br regulated genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ both identified as direct targets of the transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and/or _PROTEIN_ . as expected upon br signaling activation _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were downregulated and upregulated respectively after induction of _PROTEIN_ . taken together our data show that ap associates with _PROTEIN_ and regulates its endocytosis consequently regulating the signaling output of the receptor .
