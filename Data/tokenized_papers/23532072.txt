pathogen associated molecular pattern _PROTEIN_ trigged immunity _PROTEIN_ is the first defensive line of plant innate immunity and is mediated by pattern recognition receptors . here we show that a mutation in br signaling _PROTEIN_ a substrate of the brassinosteroid receptor brassinosteroid suppressed the powdery mildew resistance caused by a mutation in enhanced disease which negatively regulates powdery mildew resistance and programmed cell death in arabidopsis thaliana . a loss of function _PROTEIN_ mutant displayed enhanced susceptibility to virulent and avirulent pathogens including golovinomyces cichoracearum pseudomonas syringae and hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis . the _PROTEIN_ mutant also accumulated lower levels of salicylic acid upon infection with g. cichoracearum and p. syringae . _PROTEIN_ belongs to a receptor like cytoplasmic kinase family and displays kinase activity in vitro this kinase activity is required for its function . _PROTEIN_ physically associates with the _PROTEIN_ receptor _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and is required for a subset of induced responses including the reactive oxygen burst but not for mitogen activated protein kinase activation . our data demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is involved in positive regulation of _PROTEIN_ . together with previous findings our work indicates that _PROTEIN_ represents a key component directly involved in both br signaling and plant immunity .
the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ mutant displays enhanced disease resistance to the virulent powdery mildew strain g. cichoracearum . to identify components involved in _PROTEIN_ mediated resistance we conducted a mutant screen for _PROTEIN_ suppressors . in this screen we identified a mutant that we named _PROTEIN_ based on subsequent characterization . upon infection with g. cichoracearum at d after infection the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant displayed a large number of conidia and lacked visible mildew induced lesions . this is in contrast with _PROTEIN_ leaves which produced very few conidia and showed prominent cell death . to further assess the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ phenotype we quantified fungal growth by counting the number of conidiophores per colony in the wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ mutants showed significantly fewer conidiophores than the wild type plants after infection with g. cichoracearum at dai however the number of conidiophores in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants was significantly more than in _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants indicating that the _PROTEIN_ mutation fully suppressed _PROTEIN_ mediated resistance to powdery mildew . previously it was shown that _PROTEIN_ accumulates more hydrogen peroxide upon infection with g. cichoracearum and accumulation appears to occur at the site of fungal infection . to examine whether the _PROTEIN_ mutation affects accumulation in _PROTEIN_ we assessed accumulation in wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants after infection with g. cichoracearum at dai . consistent with previous findings _PROTEIN_ accumulated more than the wild type at dai however this high level of accumulation was suppressed by the _PROTEIN_ mutation . in addition to the enhanced resistance to powdery mildew the _PROTEIN_ mutant displays increased ethylene induced senescence phenotypes indicating possible crosstalk between defense responses and senescence . to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ affects _PROTEIN_ mediated ethylene induced senescence we treated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with ethylene for d and assessed the leaf senescence . the enhanced ethylene induced senescence phenotype in _PROTEIN_ was also suppressed by the _PROTEIN_ mutation . to gain insight into the molecular basis that underlies the suppression of _PROTEIN_ phenotypes by _PROTEIN_ we examined the transcript levels of several defense related genes in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants at different time points after g. cichoracearum infection . previously it was shown that _PROTEIN_ mediated resistance requires intact sa signaling therefore we selected several marker genes for the sa pathway including _PROTEIN_ related _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ phytoalexin _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which are all widely used marker genes and are upregulated when defense responses are activated . all those defense related genes were induced more strongly in _PROTEIN_ than in wild type plants at dai and in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the levels of transcript of those genes were significantly lower than in _PROTEIN_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ suppressed upregulation of defense related genes in _PROTEIN_ during g. cichoracearum infection . in the _PROTEIN_ single mutant the levels of transcript of those genes were similar to that in the wild type only the _PROTEIN_ transcript levels accumulated at significantly lower levels than in the wild type at dai upon g. cichoracearum infection . _PROTEIN_ is a recessive mutant as the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants displayed _PROTEIN_ like powdery mildew resistance phenotypes . to identify the _PROTEIN_ mutation we performed a standard map based cloning approach and identified a mutation in _GENE_ which caused an amino acid change in the predicted open reading frame . to confirm that _GENE_ is the responsible gene we made a genomic clone construct for _GENE_ and transformed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with the construct . we inoculated multiple plants with g. cichoracearum and found that the transgenic plants were all resistant to powdery mildew a phenotype indistinguishable from the _PROTEIN_ single mutant . therefore the _GENE_ genomic clone complemented the _PROTEIN_ phenotype indicating that the mutation identified in _GENE_ causes the _PROTEIN_ phenotype . _GENE_ was previously designated br signaling _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ encodes a receptor like cytoplasmic kinase belonging to the rlck xii phylogenetic clade which comprises proteins in arabidopsis . the _PROTEIN_ protein consists of an n terminal kinase domain and a c terminal tetratricopeptide repeat domain . the tpr domain is thought to be involved in protein protein interactions . the _PROTEIN_ mutation is in the tpr domain and the arg residue at position in _PROTEIN_ is strictly conserved in the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ protein family . in addition knockdown of _PROTEIN_ by rna interference also suppressed _PROTEIN_ mediated powdery mildew resistance indicating that suppression of _PROTEIN_ phenotypes in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was caused by loss of _PROTEIN_ function . the mutation in several _PROTEIN_ like genes including _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ did not suppress _PROTEIN_ mediated powdery mildew resistance . to further investigate the role of _PROTEIN_ in powdery mildew resistance we crossed _PROTEIN_ with several well characterized resistant mutants including _PROTEIN_ mildew resistance locus _PROTEIN_ powdery mildew _PROTEIN_ and autophagy _PROTEIN_ which all show sa dependent powdery mildew resistance except for _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants were susceptible to g. cichoracearum showing a large number of spores indicating that _PROTEIN_ suppressed the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mediated powdery mildew resistance phenotypes . previously _PROTEIN_ was shown to display an early senescence phenotype and this phenotype is sa dependent but jasmonic acid and ethylene independent . the _PROTEIN_ mediated senescence was suppressed in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant indicating that this phenotype also requires _PROTEIN_ function . by contrast the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants displayed mildew induced cell death phenotypes similar to _PROTEIN_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ could not suppress the disease resistance and mildew induced cell death phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ . to further explore the role of _PROTEIN_ in defense responses we first _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ single mutant with g. cichoracearum followed by quantification of conidiophore formation . the _PROTEIN_ mutant was more susceptible and supported significantly more spores than wild type plants indicating that _PROTEIN_ is required for basal resistance to g. cichoracearum . to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ plays a role in resistance to other pathogens we infected _PROTEIN_ with the virulent bacterium pseudomonas syringae pv tomato and the avirulent pto strains that carry the effector genes or avrpphb . the effectors encoded by and avrpphb are recognized by the coiled coil nbs lrr resistance proteins resistance to pseudomonas _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ respectively . we found that the _PROTEIN_ mutant was more susceptible to the virulent and avirulent strains of pto as it supports significantly more growth of all the bacterial strains than the wild type dai . in addition _PROTEIN_ accumulated lower _PROTEIN_ transcript levels than the wild type during infection with pto . similarly the _PROTEIN_ rnai plants also displayed enhanced susceptibility to pto . these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ plays an important role in resistance to both virulent and avirulent pto strains . to further investigate the role of _PROTEIN_ in defense responses we infected _PROTEIN_ with h. arabidopsidis a virulent oomycete pathogen that causes downy mildew disease in arabidopsis . the _PROTEIN_ mutant was more susceptible than wild type plants supporting the growth of more h. a. sporangiophores than the wild type indicating that the disease resistance to downy mildew also requires _PROTEIN_ . taken together these data demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ plays an important role in resistance to a variety of pathogens . the _PROTEIN_ suppressed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mediated resistance and showed enhanced susceptibility to several biotrophic pathogens suggesting that _PROTEIN_ may have defects in sa accumulation . to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ affects sa production we measured the sa levels in _PROTEIN_ before and after g. cichoracearum infection . we used _PROTEIN_ an enhanced susceptibility mutant that accumulates lower levels of sa upon pathogen infection as a susceptible control . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ accumulated much higher levels of sa than the wild type upon g. cichoracearum infection however _PROTEIN_ suppressed higher accumulation of sa levels in _PROTEIN_ . also sa levels were lower in the _PROTEIN_ mutant than the wild type at dai with g. cichoracearum . similarly the accumulation of sa in _PROTEIN_ was significantly lower than in the wild type after pto infection . this observation indicates that the enhanced susceptibility to g. cichoracearum and pto may at least partially be caused by lower sa production in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . this may also partially explain why _PROTEIN_ suppresses _PROTEIN_ resistance as previously it was shown that the powdery mildew resistant phenotype in _PROTEIN_ was suppressed by the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations which cause defects in sa accumulation and signaling respectively . previously it was shown that _PROTEIN_ localizes to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the _PROTEIN_ protein contains a myristoylation site at its n terminus which is a potential _LOCATION_ localization signal . to examine whether the myristoylation site is critical for _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ localization we created a _PROTEIN_ mutant with a disrupted myristoylation site _PROTEIN_ and fused it to green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . we then transiently transformed arabidopsis protoplasts with the construct . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein did not exclusively localize to the cell periphery . to further investigate the role of the myristoylation site in _PROTEIN_ we generated constructs to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ha or the _PROTEIN_ mutant form of _PROTEIN_ ha _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter and stably transformed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants with the construct . both the _PROTEIN_ ha and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ha transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins of the correct sizes as detected by immunoblot analysis . we then performed immunoblots with total protein and soluble and _LOCATION_ fractions from week old transgenic plants . consistent with the confocal microscopy observations _PROTEIN_ ha was detected in the _LOCATION_ fraction but not in the soluble fraction by contrast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ha was detected only in the soluble fraction . we infected the transgenic plants with g. cichoracearum and examined whether _PROTEIN_ ha and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ha restored the _PROTEIN_ like resistant phenotype in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ background as shown in figures to transgenic _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants carrying _PROTEIN_ ha were indistinguishable from _PROTEIN_ mutants in powdery mildew resistance indicating that _PROTEIN_ ha is functional . however by contrast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ha was unable to complement the _PROTEIN_ phenotype strongly suggesting that _LOCATION_ localization is essential for _PROTEIN_ function . previously citation showed that amino acid ser in _PROTEIN_ is the major phosphorylation site for the br receptor _PROTEIN_ . to examine whether the phosphorylation of this amino acid is important for _PROTEIN_ function in disease resistance we generated a mutant form of _PROTEIN_ ha that contained an substitution and transformed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ . interestingly this construct was able to fully restore the _PROTEIN_ resistant phenotypes in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ background indicating that the phosphorylation of this amino acid is not essential for _PROTEIN_ function in suppression of the _PROTEIN_ mediated defense responses . to examine whether _PROTEIN_ has protein kinase activity we produced _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli and performed in vitro kinase assays . _PROTEIN_ could autophosphorylate in vitro and its kinase activity required instead of as a divalent cation cofactor . to test whether the kinase activity is required for the _PROTEIN_ function we generated and transformed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with a kinase deficient form of _PROTEIN_ . we infected week old transgenic plants with g. cichoracearum . the kinase deficient form of _PROTEIN_ failed to restore the _PROTEIN_ resistant phenotypes in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ background indicating that kinase activity is required for _PROTEIN_ function . previously _PROTEIN_ was shown to be involved in br signaling as a substrate for the br receptor _PROTEIN_ . also the br signaling component _PROTEIN_ was shown to play a role in basal defense therefore we investigated whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ share similar functions in plant immunity . however the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant displayed _PROTEIN_ like powdery mildew resistance phenotypes indicating that _PROTEIN_ activated disease resistance does not require _PROTEIN_ . previously it was shown that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ an important player in br signaling interacts with _PROTEIN_ in vivo . we also tested whether _PROTEIN_ and bsu _PROTEIN_ are required for _PROTEIN_ mediated disease resistance . neither _PROTEIN_ nor _PROTEIN_ mutations affected _PROTEIN_ mediated powdery mildew resistance indicating that _PROTEIN_ activated defense signaling is independent of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function . the _PROTEIN_ mutants did not show obvious growth defects but _PROTEIN_ leaves were slightly narrower than wild type leaves and this phenotype was complemented by a genomic _PROTEIN_ clone . the narrow leaf phenotype in _PROTEIN_ could be an indication of activation of br signaling . to assess the br responses in the _PROTEIN_ mutant we treated the _PROTEIN_ seedlings with different concentrations of brassinolide for d and measured the root lengths . the wild type seedlings displayed typical bl responses with much shorter roots than those of the _PROTEIN_ mutant which was consistent with previous observations while the _PROTEIN_ seedlings and _PROTEIN_ rnai lines were very similar to the wild type displaying inhibited root growth . in addition to test the activity of bl signaling in the _PROTEIN_ mutant we also performed hypocotyl elongation assays on etiolated seedlings in the presence or absence of brassinazole a br biosynthesis inhibitor . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants were more sensitive to brz than the wild type and showed lower relative hypocotyl lengths by contrast the _PROTEIN_ mutant and _PROTEIN_ rnai line were indistinguishable from the wild type in response to brz . in addition the transcript accumulation of two bl responsive genes saur ac and _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ rnai plants was very similar to that of the wild type in the presence or absence of nm bl . these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ displays wild type phenotypes in response to bl treatment . previously _PROTEIN_ was identified as a possible component of an _PROTEIN_ protein complex and the _PROTEIN_ receptor _PROTEIN_ has also been shown to physically associate with _PROTEIN_ . to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a protein complex with _PROTEIN_ we performed coimmunoprecipitation assays by transiently _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ha in n. benthamiana leaves . we _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ha alone as a negative control . _PROTEIN_ was immunoprecipitated using anti _PROTEIN_ antibody and in the precipitate _PROTEIN_ was detected with anti _METHOD_ antibody only from the leaves that coexpressed both _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ha not from the negative control leaves that only _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ha . these observations indicate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ form a protein complex in n. benthamiana . previously it was shown that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ form a complex in a ligand dependent manner . to validate the n. benthamiana system we _PROTEIN_ both _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ha in n. benthamiana leaves as a control consistent with previous findings _PROTEIN_ only associated with _PROTEIN_ upon treatment . this observation indicated that ectopic _PROTEIN_ in the n. benthamiana system did not alter the behavior of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins . however the association of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ occurs without treatment and it appears that there is less interaction in the presence of . this observation was reproducible in four independent experiments . to investigate the interaction of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis we performed a co ip assay by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts . we _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ alone as a negative control . we extracted total protein from the protoplasts immunoprecipitated _PROTEIN_ protein with _METHOD_ antibody and then examined whether _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ coimmunoprecipitated with _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was detected with anti _PROTEIN_ antibody only from the protoplasts that coexpressed both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ not from the negative control indicating that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ form a protein complex in arabidopsis . similarly we also _PROTEIN_ both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts as controls and found that _PROTEIN_ only associates with _PROTEIN_ upon elicitation validating the protoplast system . to further confirm the physical association of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we performed co ip assays using stably transformed transgenic plants that _PROTEIN_ both _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ myc and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ha . transgenic plants that _PROTEIN_ only _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ha were used as a negative control . _PROTEIN_ myc restored the phenotype of _PROTEIN_ mutants and the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ha clone was able to complement the _PROTEIN_ phenotype indicating that the _PROTEIN_ myc and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ha proteins are functional . we extracted total protein from the transgenic plants and immunoprecipitated the _PROTEIN_ protein with myc antibody or with unrelated _PROTEIN_ antibody as a negative control . we then examined whether _PROTEIN_ was in the precipitate by immunoblotting with ha antibody . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ha protein was detected only in the sample immunoprecipitated with myc antibody not in the negative controls . this observation indicated that _PROTEIN_ myc physically associates with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ha in arabidopsis . _PROTEIN_ is a receptor like cytoplasmic protein kinase with an n terminal kinase domain and a c terminal tpr domain . the tpr motif was originally identified in yeast as a protein protein interaction domain . many tpr containing proteins serve as scaffolds for the assembly of multiprotein complexes and the tpr motif facilitates specific interactions between partners . the _PROTEIN_ mutation causes a substitution of a strictly conserved residue in the tpr motif . this mutation may disrupt _PROTEIN_ function by affecting interactions between _PROTEIN_ and its partner . to investigate whether this mutation affects the association of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we examined whether the mutated version of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a complex with _PROTEIN_ . as shown in figures and the mutated version of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a complex with _PROTEIN_ in both n. benthamiana and arabidopsis which was similar to the wild type _PROTEIN_ protein indicating that the _PROTEIN_ mutation did not affect the association of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . this observation suggests that the _PROTEIN_ phenotype is not caused by the defects of _PROTEIN_ in association with _PROTEIN_ . since _PROTEIN_ physically associates with _PROTEIN_ we hypothesized that _PROTEIN_ may be involved in some induced responses mediated by _PROTEIN_ . to test this hypothesis we treated wild type and _PROTEIN_ leaves with nm and measured the ros burst a marker for early basal defense responses . the _PROTEIN_ mutant was insensitive to upon treatment ros accumulated rapidly in the wild type but not in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . by contrast the accumulation of ros in _PROTEIN_ was partially impaired indicating that _PROTEIN_ had defects in the induced ros burst . the defects of _PROTEIN_ in trigged ros accumulation were complemented by a genomic _PROTEIN_ clone . similarly the _PROTEIN_ rnai plants also showed _PROTEIN_ like defects in ros accumulation upon treatment . when treated with higher concentrations of _PROTEIN_ also showed similar defects in ros accumulation . to examine whether _PROTEIN_ has a general defect in ros accumulation we examined ros accumulation in _PROTEIN_ in response to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which is specifically recognized by ef tu receptor _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . consistent with previous findings the efr mutant was insensitive to but _PROTEIN_ rapidly accumulated large amounts of ros upon treatment which was very similar to the wild type . although the effect of _PROTEIN_ mutation on responses needs to be further characterized this observation suggests that _PROTEIN_ does not have a substantial defect in ros accumulation triggered by . consistent with the role of _PROTEIN_ in induced responses _PROTEIN_ transcript accumulation increased following treatment . the level of induced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was much lower in _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type . by contrast _PROTEIN_ accumulation induced by was similar between _PROTEIN_ and the wild type . to further investigate the role of _PROTEIN_ in induced responses we also examined the effects of _PROTEIN_ on the activation of mapks by . in the wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were rapidly activated and the activation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was abolished in the _PROTEIN_ mutant which is consistent with previous findings . however _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were strongly activated in _PROTEIN_ which was similar to the wild type . similarly under our experimental conditions the induction of three induced genes _GENE_ and _GENE_ was not significantly affected in _PROTEIN_ . to characterize the _PROTEIN_ responses of _PROTEIN_ to we treated _PROTEIN_ and wild type seedlings with for d and found that inhibited seedling growth in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ but not in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . taken together these data suggest that the _PROTEIN_ mutant only compromises a subset of _PROTEIN_ mediated responses . however we can not exclude the possibility that the reason we did not observe effects of _PROTEIN_ was due to a relatively high dose of used in the experiments . such potential quantitative effects of treatment on _PROTEIN_ related phenotypes should be investigated in the future .

ethylene induced senescence assays and measurement of the chlorophyll content were performed as previously described . to create the mapping population we crossed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with ecotype landsberg _LOCATION_ . the plants homozygous for _PROTEIN_ were identified and inoculated with g. cichoracearum . initially we mapped _PROTEIN_ to chromosome between markers and _PROTEIN_ . we then developed our own molecular markers at intervals between these two markers using monsanto col and landsberg _LOCATION_ polymorphism data . we used plants from families that were homozygous for _PROTEIN_ but segregating for powdery mildew resistance . ultimately _PROTEIN_ was mapped to a kb region between markers aflii and psti . all five genes in the genetic interval were amplified and sequenced directly . to complement the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant the genomic sequence including bp upstream of the _PROTEIN_ start codon and bp downstream of the stop codon of _GENE_ was cloned into

quantitative pcr was performed as described previously . total rna was isolated using _PROTEIN_ reagent . first strand cdna from of total rna was synthesized using m mlv reverse transcriptase . real time pcr was performed with sybr green premix extaq following the manufacturer s instructions . the gene was used as an internal control for normalizing the amount of cdna . sa extraction and measurement were performed as previously described . the full length _PROTEIN_ cds without stop codon was amplified by pcr from col cdna or _PROTEIN_ mutant cdna and inserted into the gateway vector using a _PROTEIN_ clonase kit to create a _PROTEIN_ cds or _PROTEIN_ cdsm entry clone . the inserts were next subcloned using an lr clonase kit into the pearleygate destination vector with promoter and c terminal _METHOD_ fusion or into the vector with c terminal _PROTEIN_ fusion . _PROTEIN_ cds was amplified from col cdna and subcloned into pearleygate _METHOD_ through gateway technology . _PROTEIN_ cds was amplified from col cdna and subcloned into the pearleygate vector . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plasmids were kindly provided by jian min zhou . to generate a _PROTEIN_ rnai construct a bp fragment at the end was amplified by pcr . the pcr product was first cloned into pkannibal resulting in an inverted repeat separated by an intron fragment . the derived construct was then digested with noti and ligated to _PROTEIN_ vector . to produce a kinase dead version of _PROTEIN_ a conserved lys residue at position in the _PROTEIN_ binding site was substituted with a glu using site directed mutagenesis . both the genomic dna and cds of _PROTEIN_ were mutated . the mutated genomic dna was cloned into the binary vector for complementation tests . the wild type and mutant cds were digested with bamhi and sali and inserted into the pmal _PROTEIN_ vector for kinase activity assays . similarly _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were also generated using site directed mutagenesis as described above . the mutated fragments were subcloned into the pegad vector to create the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cds _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ vector for _METHOD_ observation in protoplasts . in addition _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cds _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cds _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cds were pcr amplified and inserted into the gateway vector and then cloned into the pearleygate destination vector with c terminal ha fusion . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cds was also cloned into pearleygate destination vector with c terminal myc fusion . ros assay was performed as described previously . each data point consists of at least replicates . arabidopsis seeds were surface sterilized rinsed in sterile water and grown vertically on plates containing half strength

used for transient _PROTEIN_ . two days _PROTEIN_ leaf samples were syringe infiltrated with or without for min before freezing in liquid nitrogen . leaves were ground with a mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen and extracted with ml of extraction buffer /g tissue powder . the samples were left on ice with gentle shaking for h to solubilize _LOCATION_ proteins and centrifuged at at for min .
