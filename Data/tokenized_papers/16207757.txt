the arabidopsis root epidermis is composed of two types of cells hair cells and non hair cells and their fate is determined in a position dependent manner . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a myb protein has been shown genetically to function as a master regulator to control both of the epidermal cell fates . to directly test the proposed role of _PROTEIN_ in this system we examined its subcellular localization and defined its transcriptional activation properties . we show that a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein is functional and accumulates in the _LOCATION_ of the n position cells in the arabidopsis root epidermis as expected for a transcriptional regulator . we also find that a modified _PROTEIN_ protein with a strong activation domain _PROTEIN_ promotes the formation of both epidermal cell types supporting the view that _PROTEIN_ specifies both cell fates . in addition we used the _PROTEIN_ receptor _PROTEIN_ inducible system to show that _PROTEIN_ transcription is regulated directly by _PROTEIN_ . using _METHOD_ we found two _PROTEIN_ binding sites in the _PROTEIN_ promoter . _PROTEIN_ wbsi binding was confirmed in vivo using the yeast one hybrid assay . binding between the _PROTEIN_ protein and both wbss and the importance of the two wbss in _PROTEIN_ promoter activity were confirmed in arabidopsis . these results provide experimental support for the proposed role of _PROTEIN_ as an activator of gene transcription during the specification of both epidermal cell fates .
_PROTEIN_ does not possess a detectable _LOCATION_ localization signal based on its amino acid sequence . to examine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ reporter gene was fused in frame with the _PROTEIN_ coding region and this fusion was _PROTEIN_ under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . this construct was introduced into the wer mutant in arabidopsis and was able to complement the wer mutant phenotype indicating that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein functions like the native _PROTEIN_ protein in arabidopsis . in this stably transformed arabidopsis line _METHOD_ was detected in the _LOCATION_ of the root epidermal cells preferentially in the n position cells and the _PROTEIN_ root cap cells . by contrast the pwer _METHOD_ alone does not generate a localized intracellular _METHOD_ signal . together these results suggest that the _PROTEIN_ protein is localized to the _LOCATION_ in arabidopsis cells . it has been proposed that _PROTEIN_ regulates the hair cell fate as well as the non hair cell fate in the arabidopsis root epidermis . this proposal is largely based on the _PROTEIN_ that wer plants harboring _PROTEIN_ produce a random pattern of both cell types rather than a single cell type . however it is possible that the wer _PROTEIN_ phenotype is caused by a near threshold level of _PROTEIN_ activity driven by the promoter that is insufficient to induce the non hair cell fate in all epidermal cells . to test this possibility we made a construct _PROTEIN_ which had a dual camv promoter and the _PROTEIN_ coding region fused to the activation domain of a potent viral transcriptional activator . prior to introducing this construct into plants we tested the ability of the recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein to activate transcription in a yeast one hybrid assay . when we fused this chimeric gene downstream of the dna binding domain sequence _PROTEIN_ and transformed yeast strain with this construct the reporter gene activity in this yeast was . this activity is times higher than the activity in the yeast transformed with a construct in which the native _PROTEIN_ coding region was fused downstream of the dna binding domain sequence _PROTEIN_ which demonstrates the effectiveness of the activation domain . to examine the effect of the _PROTEIN_ protein on epidermal cell specification we transformed wer _PROTEIN_ gus plants with the _PROTEIN_ construct . the _PROTEIN_ gus marker was used because _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ reflects the pattern of cell fates in the arabidopsis root epidermis . we found _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ cells and the _PROTEIN_ gus non _PROTEIN_ cells in each cell position in these _PROTEIN_ wer plants similar to the _PROTEIN_ wer plants . thus even though the transcriptional activation activity of the _PROTEIN_ protein was much higher than that of the _PROTEIN_ native protein both cell types were specified in the _PROTEIN_ wer line . this result supports the proposal that _PROTEIN_ does not only specify the non hair cell fate but also specifies the hair cell fate perhaps through its regulation of the _PROTEIN_ gene . it has been suggested that _PROTEIN_ promotes the hair cell fate through a _PROTEIN_ inhibition mechanism mediated by _PROTEIN_ in part because a functional _PROTEIN_ gene is required for _PROTEIN_ promoter activity in the n cell position . however it has not been determined yet whether _PROTEIN_ directly regulates _PROTEIN_ transcription . to address this we used the _PROTEIN_ receptor _PROTEIN_ mediated inducible system . the _PROTEIN_ inducible system has been used successfully to define direct target genes of several putative arabidopsis transcription _PROTEIN_ . we generated a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ construct in which the dna sequence for the hormone binding domain of the _PROTEIN_ receptor was fused to the _PROTEIN_ coding region and its _PROTEIN_ was driven by the camv promoter . this construct was stably introduced into wer mutant plants . in these _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ wer plants _PROTEIN_ activity is expected to depend on _PROTEIN_ because the translocation of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ recombinant protein into the _LOCATION_ should require _PROTEIN_ . furthermore the addition of cycloheximide an inhibitor of translation is expected to prevent indirect transcriptional induction of genes following dex treatment . we tested these expectations by examining the _PROTEIN_ of reporter gene _PROTEIN_ gus which was introduced by crossing into the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ wer line as a means to monitor epidermal cell specification in response to various treatments . in the absence of dex gus activity was almost undetectable in the wer mutant harboring _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ just as in the wer mutant itself . however when we applied dex to day old transgenic seedlings for hours _PROTEIN_ gus was _PROTEIN_ in epidermal cells in a pattern indistinguishable from the wer mutant harboring _PROTEIN_ . furthermore when we applied cycloheximide with dex we could not detect any gus activity . in addition to the _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ the epidermal cell fate was also affected by the application of dex . while the day old _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ wer seedlings grown without dex showed the typical wer mutant phenotype the seedlings grown on agarose media containing dex showed a random distribution of epidermal cell types similar to the phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ wer seedlings previously reported implying that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ can act like the native _PROTEIN_ protein and postembryonic functioning of _PROTEIN_ is sufficient to change the cell fate . these results show that dexamethasone is sufficient for the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion to induce _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ and that chx is effective to suppress translation of the transcribed gus mrna . specification of cell types in the root epidermis treated with dex using these established conditions we examined _PROTEIN_ rna accumulation using northern blot analysis . treatment of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ wer seedlings with dex for hours resulted in a large increase in the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ transcript when compared with seedlings not exposed to dex . to test whether this induction required de novo protein synthesis we treated the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ wer seedlings with dex plus chx . in this case the steady state level of _PROTEIN_ transcript was not reduced rather it increased slightly . this means that translocation of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ from the _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ was sufficient to induce transcription of _PROTEIN_ gene in the absence of de novo protein synthesis strongly suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is a direct regulator of _PROTEIN_ transcription . to identify the region that _PROTEIN_ binds to the _PROTEIN_ promoter we made several small dna fragments from the _PROTEIN_ promoter region and used them as probes in electrophoretic mobility shift assays _METHOD_ . the _PROTEIN_ promoter region includes kb of dna upstream of the translation start codon which is known to be sufficient to complement the cpc mutant phenotype when fused to the _PROTEIN_ coding region . for the _METHOD_ experiments we used a truncated _PROTEIN_ protein lacking its c terminal amino acids as we were not able to produce a detectable amount of the full length _PROTEIN_ protein in e. coli . we have previously shown that the c terminal amino acids are responsible for the transcriptional activation activity of _PROTEIN_ and we note that the myb domain is sufficient for dna binding specificity in animal myb protein and plant myb proteins including p _METHOD_ and . in our _METHOD_ experiments we found that _PROTEIN_ could bind to two _PROTEIN_ dna fragments and we narrowed down these regions to nucleotide fragments which were located at to and to upstream of the translation start codon respectively . we synthesized several mutant versions of these nucleotide fragments and used them in the _METHOD_ . some of the point mutated dna fragments were not recognized by _PROTEIN_ while others showed the same binding affinity for the _PROTEIN_ as the wild type fragments . using this information we were able to deduce a core sequence for the _PROTEIN_ binding site i and _PROTEIN_ binding site ii as agtagtta and caactg respectively . if the _PROTEIN_ dna binding was significantly affected when the base was mutated the bases are shown as capital letters . because we changed a base to only one different base rather than all three possible different bases we could not tell whether the bases shown as lower case letters were also important . to test the binding specificity of wbsi and wbsii we performed a competitive gel shift assay with a wild type version of wbsi or wbsii as a probe and two mutated versions of each as a competitor . binding of the _PROTEIN_ protein with wbsi and wbsii was determined to be nucleotide sequence specific because the mutated versions of wbsi and ii did not significantly inhibit the _PROTEIN_ wbss binding whereas the wild type versions of wbss did inhibit the _PROTEIN_ wbss binding . next we tested whether these two binding sites had different affinities for the _PROTEIN_ protein . when we used radiolabeled wbsi as a probe and the cold wbsii as a competitor we were able to detect a slight reduction in wbsi _PROTEIN_ binding with increasing amounts of the cold competitor . by contrast when we used wbsii as a probe and wbsi as a cold competitor the wbsii _PROTEIN_ binding was _PROTEIN_ sharply with increasing amounts of the cold competitor . these reductions were not caused by competition with mutated sequences . this competitive gel shift assay suggests that the affinity of wbsi for the _PROTEIN_ protein is much stronger than that of wbsii in vitro . to validate these _PROTEIN_ binding sites in vivo a yeast one hybrid assay was employed with these two binding sites and the _PROTEIN_ protein . for the reporter constructs we made three tandem repeats of wbsi and wbsii respectively inserted them upstream of the lacz reporter gene promoter and introduced these constructs into yeast . we also made yeast reporter strains that have three tandem copies of two mutated versions of wbsi in the lacz promoter . for the effector construct a dna fragment including the _PROTEIN_ coding region was fused to the activation domain sequence _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in these reporter strains . we found that the ad _PROTEIN_ was able to increase the galactosidase activity by threefold in the yeast harboring wbsi on its reporter gene promoter . by contrast there was no increase in the galactosidase activity when ad _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in the yeast harboring the two mutated versions of wbsi . these data clearly show that wbsi which we identified in vitro using _METHOD_ functions as a _PROTEIN_ binding site in vivo . we were not able to detect a significant increase in reporter _PROTEIN_ when the ad _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in yeast harboring wbsii on its reporter gene promoter perhaps because the galactosidase activity in this yeast without the _PROTEIN_ protein was already very high . it is possible that an endogenous yeast transcriptional activator is able to bind to this wbsii in yeast cells . we also examined the importance of the _PROTEIN_ binding sites in arabidopsis . first we co transformed arabidopsis protoplasts transiently with reporter and effector constructs . for the reporter constructs the luciferase gene was fused to the wild type and several mutant versions of the _PROTEIN_ promoter . _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ under the control of the camv promoter _PROTEIN_ as an effector . protoplasts were prepared from leaf mesophyll cells were transfected with various combinations of reporter and _PROTEIN_ effector constructs as well as a _PROTEIN_ gus construct as an internal control . when protoplasts were transfected with the wild type reporter gene and the _PROTEIN_ there was a fivefold increase in the relative luciferase activity . however when protoplasts were transfected with the mutated reporter constructs and _PROTEIN_ there was only a small increase in the relative luciferase activity . we also co transformed protoplasts with a _PROTEIN_ effector construct _PROTEIN_ and the wild type reporter construct and this combination yielded approximately threefold higher luciferase activity than the _PROTEIN_ pcpcwt luc combination which further shows that the induction is _PROTEIN_ dependent and that the domain is able to enhance the transcription activation ability of the _PROTEIN_ protein in arabidopsis . next we made stable transgenic lines with the wild type and three mutated versions of the _PROTEIN_ promoter fused to the gus reporter gene . although the wild type version showed high level of gus activity in the root epidermis the mutant versions showed very little gus activity . specifically after hours of incubation no detectable gus staining could be detected in these mutant versions whereas the wild type version showed strong gus staining . after hours of incubation some of the seedlings harboring the mutant reporter genes showed very low gus staining . these results show that the _PROTEIN_ binding sites are important for _PROTEIN_ dependent _PROTEIN_ promoter activity in the arabidopsis root epidermis .
the wer and cpc mutant alleles were described previously . the wer mutant line harboring _PROTEIN_ and the plants harboring _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ or pcpc gus have also been previously described . the _PROTEIN_ gus and pcpc gus reporter constructs were introduced into each line by genetic crosses . seeds were germinated and grown vertically on agarose solidified medium containing mineral nutrients at under continuous light . gus activity was histochemically defined by staining day old seedlings as described previously . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in seedlings was examined using a biorad radiance scanning system with excitation at nm and detection at nm . total rna was extracted from the root tips of seedlings using the _PROTEIN_ reagent according to the manufacturer 's protocol . northern blot analysis with a _PROTEIN_ gene fragment as a probe was described previously . the resulting signal was visualized with a bioimage analyzer _PROTEIN_ . labeling of dna fragments for the electrophoretic mobility shift assay was carried out using polynucleotide kinase and _PROTEIN_ as described previously and this end labeled probe was purified on a gel . electrophoretic mobility shift assays were carried out as described except that the binding reaction included mm nacl mm tris cl mm edta mm dtt glycerol poly to cpm of probe and the _PROTEIN_ protein . this reaction was incubated at room temperature for minutes and resolved on polyacrylamide gel in buffer . the gel was dried and the signal was visualized using _PROTEIN_ . e. coli transformed with pet _PROTEIN_ was treated with d thiogalactopyranoside . these bacterial cells were harvested after hour incubation at disrupted using a sonicator and were centrifuged at g for minutes to remove debris . from this extract the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein was purified using quick cartridges according to the manufacturer 's manual and was dialyzed against storage buffer . to make the chimeric genes a genomic dna fragment of the _PROTEIN_ coding region without the stop codon was pcr amplified and fused to the n terminus of the _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ gene in frame _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to the n terminus of the transactivating domain of the herpes viral in frame _PROTEIN_ or to the n terminus of the hormone binding domain of the _PROTEIN_ receptor in frame _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to examine the subcellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein the pwer _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct was generated by fusing a kb flanking region dna fragment and a kb flanking region dna fragment from the _PROTEIN_ gene to the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ chimeric gene . as a control the pwer _METHOD_ construct was made with the same _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ . for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the chimeric _PROTEIN_ dna _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was inserted between dual promoter and terminator in gus . for bd _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ dna fragment was fused to the dna binding domain in the vector . in this construct we used the coding region of the _PROTEIN_ cdna instead of genomic dna . constructions of the bd _PROTEIN_ and the ad _PROTEIN_ have been described previously . to _PROTEIN_ and purify _PROTEIN_ protein from bacteria we made pet _PROTEIN_ . the coding region of the _PROTEIN_ cdna excluding the bp long fragment was pcr amplified . this truncated dna fragment was inserted downstream of the tag sequence in the vector of using ecori and saci . all the dna fragments that were pcr amplified using phusion dna polymerase were sequenced and confirmed to be _LOCATION_ free . we used vector as a binary vector for plant transformation . plant transformation was achieved by electroporating constructs into the agrobacterium strain followed by introduction into arabidopsis using the floral dip method as previously described . seeds were harvested and transgenic plants were selected by spraying commercially available _PROTEIN_ three times a week for weeks . to compare the transcriptional activation activities of the native _PROTEIN_ protein and the _PROTEIN_ chimeric protein the yeast one hybrid assay was employed as described by sadowski et al . . bd _PROTEIN_ construct was transformed into yeast strain and lacz reporter gene _PROTEIN_ was assessed by galactosidase activity using chlorophenol red b d galactopyranoside _METHOD_ as a substrate . to test wbsi and wbsii in vivo we used the matchmaker yeast one hybrid system according to the manufacturer 's manual . we synthesized three tandem copies of wbsi wbsii or point mutated wbsis . these were inserted upstream of the gene in the vector phisi and upstream of lacz gene in placzi and these were integrated into yeast strain genome . ad _PROTEIN_ described above was introduced into this reporter strains and lacz reporter gene _PROTEIN_ was assessed . arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts were isolated and transfected as described previously . protoplasts were transfected with plasmid dna with different combinations of reporter effector _PROTEIN_ and internal control _PROTEIN_ . protoplasts were incubated in wi for hours under light conditions at room temperature . the luciferase reporter activity was determined by the luciferase assay system . the gus assay was performed as described previously .
