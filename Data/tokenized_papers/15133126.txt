previously the immunophilin like protein _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis has been demonstrated to interact with the abc transporters _PROTEIN_ and its closest homologue _PROTEIN_ . physiological and biochemical investigation of _PROTEIN_ and of _PROTEIN_ plants suggested a regulatory role of _PROTEIN_ on _PROTEIN_ transport activities . to further understand the dramatic pleiotropic phenotype that is caused by loss of function mutation of the _PROTEIN_ gene we were interested in other _PROTEIN_ interacting proteins . _PROTEIN_ a multidrug resistance associated like abc transporter has been isolated in a yeast two hybrid screen . we demonstrate molecular interaction between _PROTEIN_ and abc transporters _PROTEIN_ and its closest homologue _PROTEIN_ . unlike _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ binds to the c terminal tetratricopeptide repeat domain of _PROTEIN_ which is well known to mediate protein protein interactions . domain mapping proved that _PROTEIN_ binds to a motif of _PROTEIN_ that resembles calmodulin binding motifs and calmodulin binding to the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ was verified . by _LOCATION_ fractionation and _METHOD_ tagging we localized _PROTEIN_ to the central _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complex was verified in vivo by coimmunoprecipitation . we were able to demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ binds to isolated _LOCATION_ and has a significant impact on the uptake of metolachlor gs and estradiol _PROTEIN_ well known substrates of _LOCATION_ transporters _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ .
previously we have isolated multidrug resistance like abc transporter _PROTEIN_ as _PROTEIN_ interacting protein by screening an arabidopsis cdna library with the entire _LOCATION_ domain of _PROTEIN_ as bait . one of sequenced prey clones encoded the c terminal peptide _PROTEIN_ of multidrug resistance associated like abc transporter _PROTEIN_ . this interaction is specific because yeast strains _PROTEIN_ both proteins _PROTEIN_ high levels of galactosidase activity and were able to grow on medium lacking histidine indicating a direct interaction between these two fusion proteins . negative controls of binding domain or activation domain alone were not interacting with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ respectively . interestingly as in the case of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction the _PROTEIN_ prey also coded for the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ . this domain comprises the c terminal nucleotide binding fold covering the walker a and b boxes and the intermediate abc signature . we generated bd fusions of homologous stretches of _PROTEIN_ the closest homologue of _PROTEIN_ sharing sequence identity and some selected members of the arabidopsis mrp/abcc gene family . these peptides were tested for their ability to bind _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ not _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ specifically with _PROTEIN_ in the yeast two hybrid system as judged from galactosidase and his auxotrophy analysis . galactosidase activity for _PROTEIN_ was about lower possibly indicating a slightly lower magnitude of interaction . to verify the two hybrid data in vitro a part of the two hybrid peptide _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in e. coli . this peptide was incubated as total lysate with purified _PROTEIN_ protein immobilized on affigel beads constituting a highly specific _PROTEIN_ affinity _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was able to specifically sediment the _PROTEIN_ c terminus of kda from soluble e. coli extracts . no proteins were detected in controls in which the empty affigel resin or a vector control lysate were used . disproportional staining of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ peptides is due to different affinities of the used anti pentahis and anti rgshis recognizing _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . homology modeling revealed that the putative tpr domain localized in the c terminal part of _PROTEIN_ has the potential to form a scaffold known to act as protein protein interaction surface . to assess whether the tpr domain provided the interaction with _PROTEIN_ we tested bd fusions covering the _PROTEIN_ like and the tpr domains of _PROTEIN_ in the yeast two hybrid system . indeed _PROTEIN_ interacted with the c terminal stretch comprising the tpr domain but not with the n terminus containing the _PROTEIN_ like domain as monitored by galactosidase and his auxotrophy analysis . because the tpr construct used contained a motif with the potential to bind calmodulin downstream of the tpr repeats we generated bd fusions of the tpr motifs alone . this construct revealed similar two hybrid profiles as the tpr cambd construct proving that the tpr domain is _PROTEIN_ responsible for _PROTEIN_ complexation . compared with the entire _PROTEIN_ bait the tpr constructs displayed a reduced galactosidase activity whereas the ability to grow on his plates was in the same range . however because the galactosidase activities were significantly higher than the vector control levels the tpr domain alone _METHOD_ to be sufficient for interaction with _PROTEIN_ . a search for candidate motifs that might be responsible for interaction to _PROTEIN_ revealed the existence of a putative calmodulin binding domain as well located in the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ . calmodulin binding motifs are more conserved in _METHOD_ of structural features than in _METHOD_ of primary sequence homology many cam targets contain hydrophobic residues at positions and that are flanked by aromatic residues at positions and . although this rule is not followed strictly in _PROTEIN_ in an helical wheel presentation the peptide shows a segregation of basic and _PROTEIN_ residues to one side and hydrophobic residues to the other side typical for cambd . a putative cambd is also well conserved in _PROTEIN_ . indeed by using calmodulin overlays we were able to show that the _PROTEIN_ c terminus was able to bind calmodulin in a calcium dependent manner . calmodulin positive bands matched exactly the size of the known molecular weight of _PROTEIN_ c terminus as could be judged from western analysis of samples run in parallel . smaller soluble peptides of the e. coli cell lysate also reacted with calmodulin but are probably unspecific because cam binding took place in the absence of calcium and was also found with vector control lysates . to elucidate whether the identified cambd motif in the atmrps corresponds to the acceptor for the tpr motif of _PROTEIN_ we deleted this peptide from the ad _PROTEIN_ fusion construct . two hybrid analysis showed that with the entire soluble part of _PROTEIN_ galactosidase activity as well as growth on his plates was heavily reduced . even more obvious was the effect with the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ which contains _PROTEIN_ tpr stretches . in summary this indicates that the putative cambd alone can function as acceptor for the _PROTEIN_ tpr domain . on the basis of these findings we asked whether calmodulin would affect the binding of the _PROTEIN_ c terminus . preincubations with a high concentration of spinach calmodulin before addition of the _PROTEIN_ target seemed to have no effect on _PROTEIN_ binding to the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in pull down assays . a _PROTEIN_ gene family with putative members has been identified in arabidopsis . members that contain three repetitions of tpr motifs are _PROTEIN_ both rof _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to demonstrate specificity toward _PROTEIN_ we therefore tested tpr domains of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ interaction in the yeast two hybrid system . _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ is able to interact with _PROTEIN_ . unlike _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ not to interact with the cambd of _PROTEIN_ but with different regions of the c terminus as two hybrid analysis with _PROTEIN_ lacking the cambd showed very similar two hybrid profiles . the intracellular localization of _PROTEIN_ is unknown however the transport specificity of _PROTEIN_ approximates that of endogenous _LOCATION_ gs conjugate pumps . to determine precisely the intracellular localization of _PROTEIN_ we cloned _PROTEIN_ into a plant binary vector and constructed two independent c terminal fusions with an enhanced version of the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . both _METHOD_ were inserted into the c terminal extension after the second nucleotide binding fold of _PROTEIN_ . confocal microscope analysis of heterozygous transgenic seedlings showed high levels of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the root apex and root epidermis whereas plants transformed with vector control revealed no _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . surprisingly no _METHOD_ was found in the shoot . in the root hair zone root hairs revealed _METHOD_ caps at their tips . _METHOD_ surrounded the cells however even from close ups it was difficult to differentiate between tonoplast and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ because in fully turgid cells the cytoplasm is limited to just small stripes . therefore we _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in onion epidermis cells that were transiently transformed by particle bombardment . the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ marker a component of the slow _LOCATION_ k channel labeled the tonoplast that surrounds the central _LOCATION_ sparing the cytoplasm which is _PROTEIN_ restricted to a small spot . both _METHOD_ constructs showed very similar _PROTEIN_ patterns compared with the _LOCATION_ control suggesting that _PROTEIN_ resides on the tonoplast . in some onion cells small vesicles of unknown origin were labeled in addition to the tonoplast . to immunologically verify these data we probed arabidopsis microsomes separated by linear sucrose gradient density centrifugation with a polyclonal antiserum that was raised against a mer peptide of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . this antiserum detected a single band of the expected size in fractions of the sucrose gradient . _PROTEIN_ colocalized with the _LOCATION_ v type h _PROTEIN_ whereas markers for the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ or _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ cross reacted with other fractions . a unique feature of _PROTEIN_ is the existence a c terminal hydrophobic helical region which anchors it apparently both in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the central _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ the tonoplast . using electron microscopy a ha tagged version of constitutively overexpressed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ has been immunolocalized in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in a parallel study using _LOCATION_ fractionation and cellular immunolocalization techniques a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ location has been verified . however also in those continuous sucrose gradients _PROTEIN_ positive fractions show a clear overlap with _LOCATION_ fractions _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ of lower sucrose percentage/higher _LOCATION_ density . to verify the dual location of _PROTEIN_ we reanalyzed selected fractions derived from linear sucrose gradient separation of _PROTEIN_ ha microsomes . in contrast to our previous study we analyzed equal protein amounts of each fraction and used as a _LOCATION_ marker antisera directed against a mung bean _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . western blotting clearly indicates that _PROTEIN_ ha positive fractions overlap to similar extends with both _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ fractions . to demonstrate the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complex in vivo at _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were immunoprecipitated from solubilized wild type and transgenic _PROTEIN_ ha microsomes respectively after cross linking with thiol cleavable dtbp . cross linking was used to avoid disruption of protein protein interactions during strong detergent treatments to solubilize both _LOCATION_ proteins from the tonoplast . using immobilized anti _PROTEIN_ antiserum for immunoprecipitation wild type _PROTEIN_ was detectable in a western analysis suggesting coprecipitation with _PROTEIN_ . the same was true for _PROTEIN_ ha being slightly bigger than the wild type protein . this was the case under reducing conditions which cleave the dtbp cross linker between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . under nonreducing conditions a high molecular weight complex of more than kda was detected using anti _PROTEIN_ suggesting either multi merization of more than one _PROTEIN_ with one _PROTEIN_ or the involvement of so far unknown components . no _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ could be detected in control experiments using empty protein g respectively . vice versa using an anti ha affinity _PROTEIN_ we were able to detect _PROTEIN_ beside _PROTEIN_ ha however the entire complex could not be analyzed by _PROTEIN_ under nonreducing conditions . all cloned atmrps have been shown to transport gs conjugates such as metolachlor gs a glutathionated chloroacetanilide herbicide to different degrees in vitro . but only for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are quantitative data available . the overall transport capacity of _PROTEIN_ the sole atmrp that has been roughly localized to _LOCATION_ enriched _LOCATION_ exceeds that of _PROTEIN_ . the substrate specificity of _PROTEIN_ fits better that of an endogenous _LOCATION_ gs conjugate pumps than does _PROTEIN_ . to investigate whether the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _LOCATION_ abc transporters _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ has a physiological impact on their transport activities we measured the uptake of two abc transporter model substrates into isolated _LOCATION_ in the presence of purified _PROTEIN_ and calmodulin . isolated arabidopsis _LOCATION_ offer an ideal test system because the c termini of transporters as putative interacting domains are thought to face the cytoplasm and are therefore accessible for interfering proteins in this assay . moc gs uptake was significantly reduced by both _PROTEIN_ and calmodulin preincubation . on the other hand _PROTEIN_ protein stimulated the uptake of estradiol _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ test substrate whereas calmodulin had no significant effect . _LOCATION_ microsomes offered in excess were able to quantitatively sediment the _PROTEIN_ protein as demonstrated by western analysis when equal volumes of bound and unbound fractions were used . no _PROTEIN_ protein was detected in bound fractions when microsomes were omitted from the assay indicating the specificity of the interaction . _PROTEIN_ the expected molar ratio of _PROTEIN_ the high amount of sedimented _PROTEIN_ indicates that other transporters besides _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ might contribute to this effect . as a specific control we tested the arabidopsis protein known to structurally resemble tpr domains . this isoform of was also able to show some binding to _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but to a much lesser extend .
a stretch of _PROTEIN_ containing a tpr like domain which omits a calmodulin binding domain _PROTEIN_ as well as the c termini of arabidopsis abc transporters _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were amplified by pcr and cloned as binding domain and activation domain fusions into the two hybrid vectors and _PROTEIN_ respectively . the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ as well as the tpr domains of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were cloned by two step rt pcr as described in geisler et al . using a gene specific primer located in the untranslated region of the corresponding genes . the coding regions were amplified by pcr using vent dna polymerase and inserted into the indicated sites of two hybrid vectors and _PROTEIN_ . all constructs were sequenced to verify the absence of pcr _LOCATION_ . for interaction analysis three to five independent transformants of two independent transformations for each construct were analyzed for activation of histidine growth reporter and lacz reporter activity . therefore single colonies were resuspended in ml of sterile water and of each suspension were spotted on sd plates containing mm amino triazole lacking leucine tryptophan and histidine . growth was judged after days . galactosidase activity was quantified by liquid culture assay using standard protocols . the insert of clone _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ encoding the c terminus of at _PROTEIN_ was cut out from the two hybrid vector using bglii sites flanking the insert and ligated in frame into the bamhi site of . this way the resulting peptide was _PROTEIN_ as an n terminal his tagged fusion protein in escherichia coli strain plysc . due to an internal bglii site the c terminus was split into two halves but only the n terminal part of the interacting protein was successfully _PROTEIN_ in e. coli . a _PROTEIN_ affinity _PROTEIN_ was synthesized and incubated with cleared e. coli supernatants from cells overproducing the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ or vector

screening a size selected arabidopsis cdna library made from plants which were treated with the herbicide primisulfuron . a base pair _PROTEIN_ specific pcr fragment amplified from arabidopsis genomic dna gctcttgcagg was used as radiolabeled probe . positive lambda clones were purified and integrated plasmid vectors were excised via in vivo excision . clone pbsc contained the longest orf of _PROTEIN_ . because pbsc was lacking the first base pairs of the predicted complete orf the end of _PROTEIN_ was cloned by one step rt pcr using the titan rt pcr system and of arabidopsis rna followed by a second pcr using a fold dilution of the one step rt pcr reaction as template . nested pcr primers contained noti and sphi restriction sites that enabled completion of the orf in pbsc resulting in vector pbsc _PROTEIN_ . a noti _PROTEIN_ was ligated into a xhoi site downstream the stop codon of vector pbsc _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ orf was subcloned as noti xhoi fragment into vector resulting in _PROTEIN_ . the entire gene of an enhanced _METHOD_ version _METHOD_ was pcr amplified and inserted into the hindiii and xbai sites of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ respectively . the cassette containing the camv promoter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the polyadenylation signal was excised with asci and inserted into vectors pgptv bar and the resulting binary constructs pgptv _PROTEIN_ and pgptv _PROTEIN_ were used to transform arabidopsis via vacuum infiltration using agrobacterium strain . resistant transformants were selected on soil by watering with a _PROTEIN_ solution . genetic nomenclature was used following the community standards for arabidopsis genetics . onion epidermis cell layers were transfected with both constructs and pgptv _PROTEIN_ after coating gold microparticles using a particle inflow gun as described in ibrahim et al . . after bombardment at low pressure helium flow epidermal layers were incubated at rt for h in the dark . transgenic arabidopsis plants were grown for days on _METHOD_ plates including _PROTEIN_ under continuous light . transfected onion epidermis cells and young arabidopsis seedlings were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy _PROTEIN_ . fitc _METHOD_ using the corresponding filter sets was recorded and stored images were then colored as green or red colors using adobe photoshop _METHOD_ . arabidopsis microsomes were prepared and separated by continuous sucrose gradient centrifugation as described in geisler et al . . nitrocellulose _LOCATION_ were probed with anti _PROTEIN_ and the following marker enzyme antibodies anti p type h _PROTEIN_ anti v type h _PROTEIN_ anti _PROTEIN_ and anti _PROTEIN_ as described in geisler et al . . the anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies were raised in rabbits by injecting mg of synthetic peptide which was conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin . the peptide sequence corresponds to the internal hydrophilic region of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . for _LOCATION_ pull down assays arabidopsis _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were incubated for min with _PROTEIN_ or protein in sorbitol buffer at . proteins were _PROTEIN_ from plasmids and purified by ni affinity chromatography and dialyzed against sorbitol buffer . vesicles were pelleted by ultracentrifugation and washed twice with sorbitol buffer . equal volumes of pellets and supernatants were separated by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and were detected using monoclonal anti pentahis antibodies . immunoprecipitations using protein g coupled anti _PROTEIN_ were carried out as described in geisler et al . with the following modifications microsomal

immunoprecipitations using anti ha affinity _PROTEIN_ were carried out according to the manufacturer with microsomes derived from arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ an n terminal ha tagged version of
