dead box rna helicases are involved in rna metabolism including pre mrna splicing ribosome biogenesis rna decay and gene _PROTEIN_ . in this study we identified a homolog of the _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ which encodes a dead box protein in arabidopsis thaliana . the gene was _PROTEIN_ ubiquitously throughout the plant . the _PROTEIN_ fused to green _METHOD_ protein was localized in the _LOCATION_ . homozygosity for the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ could not be obtained . progeny of selfed arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ heterozygote plants were obtained at a heterozygote to wild type ratio of which suggested that the _PROTEIN_ gene was involved in gametogenesis . therefore we performed a reciprocal cross to determine whether _PROTEIN_ was involved in female gametophyte development . female gametogenesis was delayed in _PROTEIN_ and asynchronous development of the female gametophytes was found within a single pistil . knock down of _PROTEIN_ gave a pleiotropic phenotype and led to the accumulation of unprocessed pre rrna . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is essential for mitotic division during female gametogenesis and plays an important role in rrna biogenesis in arabidopsis .
to study the role of _PROTEIN_ in plants a cdna fragment of _PROTEIN_ was isolated and found to encode a protein of amino acids with nine conserved rna helicase motifs and two _LOCATION_ localization signals at its c terminus . the phylogenetic tree of _PROTEIN_ proteins showed that _PROTEIN_ and were grouped together and were closely related to yeast and human . the degree of amino acid sequence identity between _PROTEIN_ and was . _PROTEIN_ shared identity and similarity with yeast . with respect to human _PROTEIN_ shared identity and similarity . to determine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ we generated a construct that encoded _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ under the control of a promoter and introduced the construct into onion epidermal cells by particle bombardment . in cells transformed with promoter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signal was only detected in the _LOCATION_ with dense spots which were co localized with the nucleolus . in contrast in cells transformed with promoter _METHOD_ the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signal was detected in the _LOCATION_ and the cytoplasm . these results indicated that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein localized to the _LOCATION_ and nucleolus . to determine the _PROTEIN_ pattern of the _PROTEIN_ gene in arabidopsis reverse transcription pcr was performed . total rna was isolated from a variety of tissues and specific primers were used to detect _PROTEIN_ and actin _PROTEIN_ mrna . fig . shows that _PROTEIN_ mrna was present in all of the organs selected including rosette leaves cauline leaves _METHOD_ roots flowers and siliques . these results indicated that _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ ubiquitously throughout the plant . on the other hand _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is induced by _PROTEIN_ from microarray data that are available at the genevestigator database . the promoter activity of the _PROTEIN_ genes was analyzed further by using a _PROTEIN_ reporter . the _PROTEIN_ promoter was fused upstream of the gus reporter gene uida and _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . more than independent transgenic plants were obtained for the _PROTEIN_ construct . three transformants that carried transgenes were selected for further analysis of gus _PROTEIN_ . transgenic arabidopsis lines that contained the uida gene driven by the _PROTEIN_ promoter showed gus _PROTEIN_ in most vegetative organs including roots cotyledons leaves trichomes and inflorescence _METHOD_ . gus activity was also detected in reproductive organs such as stigmata anthers _PROTEIN_ and siliques . moreover close observation showed that _PROTEIN_ of gus could be detected in pollen grains vascular tissues of the stamen pollen tubes and ovules . therefore gus activity could be detected in most organs and tissues of the transgenic arabidopsis plants which indicated that the _PROTEIN_ gene was transcribed ubiquitously during different stages of plant development . to elucidate the biological role of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis three transfer dna insertion lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were identified and characterized . the genotypes of the progeny from self crosses of the _PROTEIN_ heterozygous mutants were analyzed by pcr based screening . the results of this analysis revealed that all analyzed progeny plants from either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ heterozygous parents were heterozygous or wild type . however approximately of the progeny from _PROTEIN_ heterozygous plants were homozygous for the mutant allele . the _PROTEIN_ level of the _PROTEIN_ transcript in the _PROTEIN_ homozygous plants was similar to that in the wild type as shown by rt pcr analysis . moreover the _PROTEIN_ homozygous plants did not show morphological differences compared with the wild type plants . therefore in the _PROTEIN_ mutant line the t dna insertion in the promoter region did not affect the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene and this might explain why homozygotes were only obtained for the _PROTEIN_ mutant allele . these results indicated that no homozygous _PROTEIN_ knock out plant could be obtained among all examined progeny . to confirm this conclusion a binary vector that contained the genomic dna for _PROTEIN_ fused to its own promoter and terminator was transformed into _PROTEIN_ heterozygous plants for functional complementation . three independent hygromycin resistant transformants were selected and the genotypes of the progeny plants were analyzed . the analysis indicated that _PROTEIN_ homozygous plants were obtained in all selected progeny populations . one example is shown in fig . four plants among eight randomly selected hygromycin resistant plants did not contain the wild type _PROTEIN_ allele . the observation of homozygous _PROTEIN_ alleles in transgenic plants indicated that the distorted segregation could be fully complemented by _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ cdna . the wild type to heterozygote ratio of the progeny of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ heterozygotes was approximately in arabidopsis therefore we hypothesized that _PROTEIN_ might play an essential role in either gametophyte development or fertilization during plant reproduction . to determine whether the distortion in segregation was caused by a developmental defect during gametogenesis we performed reciprocal crosses between the _PROTEIN_ heterozygote and wild type plants and then counted each genotype among the progeny populations . as shown in table the progeny population from self crossed _PROTEIN_ heterozygous plants segregated with a ratio of wild type to heterozygous plants . no transmission of the _PROTEIN_ allele was observed when the _PROTEIN_ heterozygote was used as the female parent and backcrossed with the wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . on the other hand when the _PROTEIN_ heterozygote was used as the male parent and backcrossed with the wild type the progeny population segregated in a ratio of wild type to heterozygous plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . this showed that the transmission rate of the _PROTEIN_ mutant allele was reduced only slightly compared with that of the wild type allele . therefore we concluded that the _PROTEIN_ allele could be transmitted through the male but not the female gametophyte . the roots leaves shoots and flowers of _PROTEIN_ heterozygous plants could not be distinguished morphologically from those of wild type plants . however _PROTEIN_ heterozygous plants produced short siliques and had a significant number of aborted seeds . the length of the siliques from _PROTEIN_ heterozygotes was approximately two thirds shorter than that of wild type plants at the same age . siliques were collected from self crossed _PROTEIN_ heterozygotes and the numbers of mature and aborted seeds were counted . the analyzed siliques from the _PROTEIN_ heterozygous progeny contained mature seeds and aborted seeds compared with mature seeds and aborted seeds in the wild type progeny . to address further whether _PROTEIN_ functions in male gametophyte development the pollen viability of _PROTEIN_ heterozygote plants was determined by alexander staining . in fig . no obvious difference was found in pollen morphology and pollen viability between the _PROTEIN_ mutant and the wild type . moreover the pollen germination rates in _PROTEIN_ heterozygote plants were similar to those of wild type plants . together these results clearly indicated that mutation of _PROTEIN_ affected female gametophyte development and slightly impaired male gametophyte development . the female gametophyte is generated from the functional megaspore via a process called megagametogenesis . megagametogenesis begins with mitosis cellularization and degeneration to develop a functional embryo sac that contains an egg cell two synergid cells and a central cell . citation have used confocal laser scanning microscopy _PROTEIN_ to observe the process of megagametogenesis in arabidopsis and have divided this process into eight stages female gametophyte _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to study how the _PROTEIN_ mutation affects megagametogenesis we performed _PROTEIN_ to compare the progress of female gametophyte development in wild type and _PROTEIN_ heterozygous plants . eight stages of megagametogenesis were observed in wild type plants by _PROTEIN_ and are shown in fig . . often two or three sequential developmental stages predominate among ovules within the same pistil in arabidopsis . these results are consistent with the previous finding that the development of ovules within a pistil is synchronous in arabidopsis . for the _PROTEIN_ mutant pistils were isolated from flower buds and analyzed by _PROTEIN_ . the results showed that the development of most mutant embryo sacs was asynchronous . some female gametophytes within a single pistil spanned five or more developmental stages such as shown in table . for example among analyzed ovules from pistil four were at stage _PROTEIN_ eight were at stage _PROTEIN_ three were at stage _PROTEIN_ were at stage _PROTEIN_ and four were at stage _PROTEIN_ . after manual pollination embryogenesis was analyzed in wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . in selected wild type pistils all the developing seeds were at the zygote stage with or nucleate endosperm in the embryo sac . however in the pollinated _PROTEIN_ pistils less than half the ovules developed into seeds that had nucleate or nucleate endosperm in the embryo sac the rest of the ovules were still at stages _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . together these results indicated that the _PROTEIN_ mutant ovules showed a delayed progression in the female gametophytic cell cycle . to investigate the role of the _PROTEIN_ gene in whole plants an inducible rna interference approach was applied . a bp fragment that corresponded to the end of the _PROTEIN_ cdna was cloned in an inverted repeat orientation that flanked a _METHOD_ dna fragment under the control of a chimeric promoter that contained the lexa operator fused upstream to a minimal promoter . the rnai construct and an effector plasmid xve were co transformed into arabidopsis . under selection for kanamycin and hygromycin resistance six independent transgenic plants that contained both rnai and effector t dna insertions were obtained and verified by genomic dna pcr analysis . ten day old transgenic seedlings were used to study the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ and its downstream response . the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ mrna was reduced dramatically in all the rnai lines after treatment with estradiol as compared with dimethylsulfoxide _METHOD_ . the root length of the seedlings was reduced significantly in all of the selected _PROTEIN_ knock down lines as compared with the wild type and xve transgenic plants . to determine whether the short root phenotype observed in the _PROTEIN_ knockdown lines was caused by loss of cell viability the triphenyltetrazolium chloride cell viability assay was performed . cell viability in the root tip was reduced in the _PROTEIN_ knock down lines as compared with xve transgenic plants . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ affects plant growth and development seeds from the wild type and from the _PROTEIN_ knockdown lines and were germinated in murashige and skoog _METHOD_ medium with either estradiol or _METHOD_ and their phenotypes were compared . seed germination and seedling growth were retarded only in estradiol treated transgenic lines but not in wild type and xve transgenic plants . in addition when the week old plants were shifted to medium that contained estradiol short roots abnormal leaves accumulation of anthocyanin delayed reproductive transition and early senescence were observed as compared with treatment with _METHOD_ . overall these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is required for plant growth and development . in eukaryotic cells transcription of rdna generates a rrna precursor which comprises ets rrna _PROTEIN_ rrna rrna ets . and rrna are formed by cleavage of the rrna precursor . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ plays a role in arabidopsis rrna maturation the rrna precursor was analyzed in _PROTEIN_ knock down lines . ten day old wild type and plants were transferred for d to medium that contained either estradiol or _METHOD_ . total rna was isolated from the roots of each individual line and rt pcr was performed to evaluate the abundance of the rrna precursor . under estradiol treatment the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was knocked down significantly and the level of the rrna precursor was increased in all three estradiol inducible rnai plants as compared with the wild type . the specific primers and were used to show that an equal amount of total rrna which included the mature and immature _METHOD_ of was included in all the pcrs . the actin gene was used as a loading control for the pcr analysis . knock down of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ resulted in accumulation of immature rrna precursor which suggested that _PROTEIN_ participates in the processing of rrna in arabidopsis .
