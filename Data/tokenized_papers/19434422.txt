although several glycine rich protein _PROTEIN_ genes were isolated and characterized very little is known about their function . the primary structure of _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis thaliana has a signal peptide followed by a region with high glycine content . in this work green _METHOD_ protein fusions were obtained in order to characterize the sub cellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein . the results indicated that this protein is the first described _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . sense antisense and rnai transgenic a. thaliana plants were generated and analyzed phenotypically . plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ showed longer roots and an enhanced elongation of the inflorescence axis while antisense and rnai plants demonstrated the opposite phenotype . the analysis of a knockout t dna line corroborates the phenotypes obtained with the antisense and rnai plants . altogether these results suggest that this _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ could be involved in organ growth by promoting cell elongation processes .
the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ is a kda protein with high glycine content . _PROTEIN_ contains at its n terminal portion a signal peptide consensus sequence followed by a glycine rich region with n repeats without any other characterized signature . this feature implicates _PROTEIN_ as a member of the class i _PROTEIN_ family . to analyze the function of the _PROTEIN_ gene we generated three series of transgenic arabidopsis plants with _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ of this gene in planta . in the first series the suppression of _PROTEIN_ mrna levels was attempted by constitutive _PROTEIN_ of an antisense construct driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . in the second series the antisense construct was _PROTEIN_ under the control of its own promoter . plants from the third series _PROTEIN_ an _PROTEIN_ rnai construct under the control of camv promoter . fourteen out of obtained transgenic plants of the lines out of of the a lines and out of of the lines presented phenotypic alterations . although with different intensities the introduction of all three constructs in arabidopsis led to the same phenotype . plants carrying these constructs showed shorter roots and shorter inflorescence axis . as expected the rnai construct presented the most drastic effect resulting in plants with severe phenotypes including leaf size . for this reason a representative line was used for subsequent analysis . quantitative analyses of these results are summarized in fig . b . to confirm the downregulation of _PROTEIN_ gene in the transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ mrna levels were accessed in by qpcr . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was reduced to in rnai lines compared to _PROTEIN_ control plants . the recent release of a salk t dna line with insertion in the utr of _PROTEIN_ allowed us to confirm the results obtained with the knock down transgenics . the lines were genotyped and plants with homozygous insertion were selected _PROTEIN_ . plants homozygous for the insertion present the same phenotypes observed in the knock down transgenic lines . in order to confirm the reduction of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the t dna insertion mutant the plants were submitted to qpcr analysis . compared with the col control _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in these plants was reduced to almost undetectable levels indicating that is an effective knockout mutant . in order to further evaluate the role of _PROTEIN_ in plants we generated transgenic arabidopsis that constitutively _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of the camv promoter . of the analyzed lines containing this construct showed phenotypic alterations . the analysis of these lines indicated that the _PROTEIN_ of the sense construct led to opposite phenotypes of those obtained with the knock down transgenic plants . the transgenic lines presented an increase in root and inflorescence axis length as well as in leaf size . the quantitative analyses of these phenotypes are summarized in fig . and b . northern blot analysis was performed confirming that _PROTEIN_ steady state mrna levels were higher in lines when compared to the _PROTEIN_ wild type . in order to confirm that the inflorescence axis elongation phenotype observed in the _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants and the _PROTEIN_ mutant is due to cell elongation defects and not to flowering time perturbation the numbers of leaves during vegetative stage/reproductive stage transition were measured . indeed all plants flowered at the same time based on leaf number . in the _PROTEIN_ background both wild type and transgenic plants developed approximately leaves before flowering . the transition occurred between and days after germination . in the col background both wild type and _PROTEIN_ developed approximately leaves before flowering . as observed in the _PROTEIN_ background the transition also occurred between and days after germination . in order to characterize inflorescence architecture in the transgenic lines with reduced _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant inflorescences were analyzed . no clusters of cauline leaves and/or flowers/siliques were observed in the mutant or in the transgenic lines indicating that internodal elongation was not severely affected in those plants . the elongation defects presented by transgenic lines with reduced _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant could be explained by an elongation rate defect and/or a cell division impairment . the possibility that minor to moderate effects in internodal elongation could also be accounted for the inflorescence phenotype can not be discarded . more detailed analysis should be perform in order to clarify if the final cell length is affected in this organ . based on this analysis we concluded that the differences observed in the inflorescence axes length in the various transgenic plants and _PROTEIN_ compared to wild type are due to elongation defects and not to severe internodal elongation and/or flowering time . in order to elucidate the sub cellular localization of _PROTEIN_ in vivo _PROTEIN_ cdna was fused in frame at its c terminal end with the _METHOD_ marker gene . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was _PROTEIN_ under the control of the camv promoter in arabidopsis plants and tobacco cells . the sub cellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was determined by imaging _METHOD_ _METHOD_ using a confocal laser scanning microscope . a control construct containing unfused _METHOD_ gene was also used . in plant cells free _METHOD_ is known to be localized in _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ of the fusion protein resulted in a _METHOD_ specific green _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ of cells as well as in root cells of arabidopsis seedlings . to the best of our knowledge this is the first plant _PROTEIN_ to be localized in the _LOCATION_ compartment . as expected for plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants also presented longer roots and inflorescence axes as well as bigger leaves indicating that the _PROTEIN_ protein produced from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct is functional . _PROTEIN_ is composed of an n terminal region containing a predicted signal peptide followed by a non glycine rich region and at its c terminus a glycine rich region is present without any other obvious motifs . we wondered if this non glycine rich n terminus containing a predicted signal peptide was sufficient to target this protein to the _LOCATION_ or as observed for many _LOCATION_ proteins the _LOCATION_ localization signal also needs sequences determinants located at the c terminal end of the protein . to analyze this hypothesis a construct containing the _PROTEIN_ n terminal region was fused translationally to the _METHOD_ gene _METHOD_ under the control of the camv promoter . this construct was used to transform arabidopsis and tobacco cells . confocal analysis of the transgenic arabidopsis seedlings and cells indicates that the _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ fused to the _PROTEIN_ n terminus also results in a _METHOD_ specific green _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ suggesting that n terminus itself is sufficient to target proteins to this sub cellular compartment . in order to obtain more information about orthologs and homologs searches in the rice and arabidopsis genomes were performed . it was previously observed for different gene families that the _LOCATION_ sorting signal of _LOCATION_ proteins can be found as extensions that are absent in the secreted _METHOD_ of proteins of the same family . therefore a search for _PROTEIN_ homologs presenting or not the non glycine rich region following the signal peptide was performed . in arabidopsis class i _PROTEIN_ genes were identified . all of them presented a signal peptide and among them presented a non glycine rich region following the signal peptide as observed in _PROTEIN_ . of those genes presented homology with _PROTEIN_ . an analysis of those sequences with various localization prediction _METHOD_ was performed . according to these analyses and might be secreted proteins . presented a non glycine rich region following the signal peptide however no similarities were found with the _PROTEIN_ sequence . presented only a signal peptide followed by a glycine rich domain as expected for secreted _METHOD_ . _GENE_ localizations prediction was not conclusive . it was predicted to be localized in the chloroplast by wolf psort even though chlorop prediction program could not identify the chloroplast targeting sequence . it presents a non glycine rich region following the signal peptide that is longer than that observed in _PROTEIN_ and no similarities were found . finally was predicted to be in the _LOCATION_ . this particular _PROTEIN_ presented high similarity and identity in the non glycine rich region following the signal peptide with _PROTEIN_ corresponding sequece . in _PROTEIN_ a consensus sequence of g l d/e d q k n/t f was observed in these two arabidopsis homologs . in addition is highly similar to _PROTEIN_ throughout the protein sequence . this indicates that is probably an _PROTEIN_ homolog and its potential redundant partner . in rice six genes present homology to _PROTEIN_ . all of them present predicted signal peptide sequences . according to localization prediction _METHOD_ two sequences present only a signal peptide followed by a glycine rich domain . these two genes are good candidates to encode secreted _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ in rice . four other proteins are predicted to be localized to the _LOCATION_ . and present a glycine rich region following the signal peptide but with different types of repeats as that the observed in their c terminal glycine rich domain . presents a non glycine rich region following the signal peptide . however no similarities with _PROTEIN_ non glycine rich region were observed . finally presents a non glycine rich region similar to the _PROTEIN_ region . is a good candidate for being the _PROTEIN_ ortholog in rice . in the analysis of eucalyptus transcriptome two _PROTEIN_ presenting homology to _PROTEIN_ were found . the analysis of those sequences indicates that none of them present a signal peptide sequence suggesting that they probably encode intercellular proteins . in the sugarcane transcriptome analysis nine sequences presenting homology to _PROTEIN_ were identified . unfortunately only one of those sequences presented a complete region . according to wolf psort localization prediction program this protein might be localized in the _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ . this sequence encodes a protein that contains a signal peptide followed by a non glycine rich region as observed in _PROTEIN_ . this region presents similarities with _PROTEIN_ and rice . a consensus sequence of a a a/g d/e e k f/s l w l k k is observed in the two monocot _PROTEIN_ . this _PROTEIN_ is a good candidate for being the _PROTEIN_ ortholog in sugarcane . in plants organ size defects can be caused by increased or reduced number of cells or by perturbation in cell elongation . in _PROTEIN_ most of the growth of a plant is due to cell elongation and the _LOCATION_ plays a very important role in this process . based on the localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein and the phenotypes obtained with the transgenic lines with reduced or enhanced _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene one would speculate that cell elongation processes might be disturbed in those plants . in order to investigate the cause of length defects on _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines root cells were analyzed in detail . the root system was chosen for this analysis because of the simplicity of its organization and its transparency . the difference in cell size between the transgenic lines and wild type was evident . the line root cells are smaller when compared to wild type while the line cells are bigger . additionally the cells of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants are bigger than the cells of nt _METHOD_ or free _METHOD_ plants . however the confocal analysis of those cells indicated that the overexpression of _PROTEIN_ caused by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion does not cause any visible _LOCATION_ morphological defects . to evaluate cell elongation in the absence of cell division we performed an analysis of hypocotyl elongation in dark grown plants . in the dark wild type seedlings follow the skotomorphogenetic developmental program which results in hypocotyl cell elongation . hormones such as auxin gibberellin and brassinosteroids are known to promote cell elongation on hypocotyls under skotomorphogenesis . _PROTEIN_ knockout plants _PROTEIN_ presented reduced hypocotyl length when compared to col wild type plants . these results indicate that knockout plants present perturbed cell elongation that could account for the phenotypes observed in _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines . whether these hypocotyl elongation defects can be rescued by exogenous application of hormones and whether _PROTEIN_ is modulated by these hormones are still to be tested .
