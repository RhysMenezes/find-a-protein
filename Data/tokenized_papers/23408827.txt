the arabidopsis mutant heat intolerant _PROTEIN_ was isolated from an ethyl methanesulphonate mutagenized population on the basis of its inability to withstand prolonged heat stress . further characterization indicated that _PROTEIN_ was impaired specifically in _METHOD_ of basal but not acquired thermotolerance . map based cloning revealed that the _PROTEIN_ gene encoded a plant specific protein for which the molecular function has yet to be studied . to investigate the cellular role of _PROTEIN_ and hence elucidate better its protective function in heat tolerance in plants a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ reporter construct was created for a protoplast transient _PROTEIN_ assay . results showed that _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ was localized to the chromocentre a condensed heterochromatin domain that harbours repetitive elements for which transcription is normally suppressed by transcriptional gene silencing . dapi staining analysis and fish with a probe that targeted centromeric repeats showed that heat induced chromocentre decondensation was inhibited in _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ subjected to direct heat treatment but not in those that were allowed to acquire thermotolerance . moreover heat reactivation of various tgs loci _PROTEIN_ of whether they were endogenous or transgenic or existed as a single copy or as repeats was found to be attenuated in _PROTEIN_ . meanwhile the levels of transcripts of heat shock protein genes in response to heat stress were similar in both _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants . collectively these results demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ defines a new tgs regulator that acts at the level of heterochromatin organization and is essential for basal thermotolerance in plants .
arabidopsis seedlings that had been mutagenized with _METHOD_ were examined under permissive heat stress conditions to screen for heat hypersensitive mutants . one selected mutant _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ confirmed by retesting the generation with a heat survivability assay . there was no difference in appearance between the mutant and wild type seedlings under normal growth conditions . for day old seedlings incubation at for days was lethal to _PROTEIN_ but not the wild type . this treatment was employed subsequently for genetic analysis and the results showed that all of the plants from a cross between _PROTEIN_ and the wild type could tolerate the heat treatment . furthermore analysis of the progeny from the self pollinated showed a segregation ratio for heat tolerant to heat sensitive _METHOD_ . thus the heat intolerant phenotype of _PROTEIN_ is attributable to a single recessive _LOCATION_ mutation . depending on the intensity duration and rate of temperature change different types of heat stress can impose diverse effects on plants and plants have evolved a variety of protective _METHOD_ that contribute to survival during these different types of heat stress . to obtain a better understanding of the responses of _PROTEIN_ to other _METHOD_ of heat stress this study compared the thermotolerance of _PROTEIN_ with those of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . these mutants were chosen because they have been shown to be defective specifically in _METHOD_ of tolerance to sustained heat stress _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ sudden heat shock _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and acquired thermotolerance _PROTEIN_ . the survivability assay used in the genetic analysis indicated that _PROTEIN_ was hypersensitive to sustained heat stress . for the sudden heat shock test day old seedlings were exposed directly to for and then returned to room temperature for recovery . after recovery for days whereas leaves of the wild type and _PROTEIN_ remained green and showed visible expansion the leaves of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings were bleached . for the acquired thermotolerance tests seedlings were pre treated at for before being subjected to for at least and _PROTEIN_ was found to be able to acquire tolerance to severe heat shock to a similar extent to the wild type . therefore the protective role of _PROTEIN_ in the heat tolerance of plants was shown to be more specific to basal than to acquired thermotolerance . given that _PROTEIN_ is defective in _METHOD_ of only basal and not acquired thermotolerance and that acquired thermotolerance is correlated strongly with the production of _PROTEIN_ this study then monitored the transcripts of major species of _PROTEIN_ in heat exposed _PROTEIN_ plants and found that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ could all be induced to levels equivalent to or even in excess of those in the wild type . these results are consistent with those for the _PROTEIN_ phenotype . a noteworthy observation is that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was itself heat inducible . to identify the genetic determinant that underlies the _PROTEIN_ heat intolerant phenotype the locus of the _PROTEIN_ mutation was mapped by positional cloning . initially coarse mapping of _PROTEIN_ mutants derived from an segregating population of a cross between _PROTEIN_ and the wild type placed the mutation on the upper arm of chromosome v approximately cm from the microsatellite marker _PROTEIN_ . subsequent fine mapping of individuals characterized the location of the _PROTEIN_ locus further to a kb region defined by the molecular markers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which are located on two overlapping bac clones and respectively . this region comprises at least eight candidate genes with _PROTEIN_ annotation numbers from _GENE_ to _GENE_ . the entire kb region from _PROTEIN_ was sequenced by pcr and the sequence compared to that from wild type plants . the results revealed a base transition from c to a in the sixth exon of _GENE_ which led to an amino acid substitution of to tyrosine . this result indicated that _PROTEIN_ mutation is likely to yield a functionally altered protein product . to confirm the identity of _PROTEIN_ a kb genomic dna fragment of _GENE_ including the promoter and the and untranslated regions was cloned into the ti binary vector . this construct was introduced into agrobacteria and then transformed into the _PROTEIN_ mutant . five independent hygromycin resistant lines were obtained and all transformants had _PROTEIN_ the ability to tolerate both sustained high temperature and sudden heat shock stress which demonstrated that a defect in the _GENE_ gene causes the heat intolerant phenotype in _PROTEIN_ . to learn more about the possible role of _PROTEIN_ we searched the t dna insertion collections from the _PROTEIN_ and found two possible _PROTEIN_ alleles _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in which t dna was inserted into the and utrs respectively . for _PROTEIN_ the attempt to isolate homozygous mutant plants was unsuccessful . genotyping of the progeny from a heterozygous parental plant showed a ratio of heterozygous to homozygous progeny with no insert . meanwhile genotyping of progeny from reciprocal crosses in which either the wild type plant was used as a pollen donor to pollinate mutant pistils or the heterozygous plant was used as a pollen donor to pollinate wild type pistils showed a nearly ratio of heterozygous to no insert progeny . in contrast homozygous mutant plants of _PROTEIN_ could be isolated but showed a heat tolerant phenotype . rt pcr analysis showed that the level of _PROTEIN_ mrna was the same in _PROTEIN_ as in wild type plants . these results together with the finding that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ predominately at the early stages during embryogenesis indicate that the t dna insertion in _PROTEIN_ causes embryonic lethality that the _PROTEIN_ mutation is a partially functional allele and that the insertion in _PROTEIN_ does not affect the normal _PROTEIN_ and function of _PROTEIN_ . the predicted _PROTEIN_ protein comprises amino acids with a molecular _METHOD_ of . according to the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is an uncharacterized protein for which the cellular function is unknown . blastp analysis of _PROTEIN_ against a non redundant protein sequence database showed that the _PROTEIN_ protein exhibits a high degree of sequence conservation among land plants with between and identity and between and similarity but is not found in _METHOD_ in other _METHOD_ . an unrooted neighbour joining tree computed from the multiple protein sequence alignment showed that _PROTEIN_ orthologues can be grouped into at least two clusters . clade i contains exclusively monocotyledonous plants whereas clade ii contains exclusively dicotyledonous ones . on the other hand the small number of homologues in certain taxa only one in each of _METHOD_ lycophytes and bryophytes means that these taxa can not be grouped phylogenetically but perhaps represents the early evolution of _PROTEIN_ in plantae . together these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ evolved independently in the plant lineage and might contribute to plant function on land . to elucidate the function of _PROTEIN_ the protein sequence was analysed for known motifs and domains using search pfam and scanprosite . however no significant hits could be identified . nevertheless previous proteomic analysis detected the presence of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ . to verify that _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ protein a reporter construct was created by in frame fusion of the c terminal end of the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ to the n terminal end of _PROTEIN_ for transient _PROTEIN_ analysis in protoplasts . the results showed that _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ was indeed localized to the _LOCATION_ . more specifically the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ appeared to be located in conspicuous _LOCATION_ bodies of which there were up to in number per _LOCATION_ . given that the heterochromatic regions of each chromosome in arabidopsis interphase _LOCATION_ are known to cluster into compact chromocentres and that diploid arabidopsis cells contain chromosomes the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals are likely to represent the locations of chromocentres . to verify this the _LOCATION_ of protoplasts that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were isolated and stained with dna binding dye dapi . clear localization of _PROTEIN_ at chromocentres was indicated by the perfect overlay of the _METHOD_ signals of _METHOD_ and dapi . the effect of heat stress on the organization of chromatin in arabidopsis has been studied only recently and it was found that prolonged heat stress can result in substantial decondensation of chromocentres . consequently the findings that _PROTEIN_ was a heat intolerant mutant and that _PROTEIN_ localized to chromocentres prompted this study to investigate the potential role of _PROTEIN_ in the heat induced changes in the compaction of heterochromatin . to this end first dapi stained _LOCATION_ of root cells of day old seedlings were examined in the zones of elongation and maturation . before heat stress compact chromocentres were observed in more than of _LOCATION_ from both the wild type and _PROTEIN_ . after heat exposure for at the compact chromocentres from the wild type were dispersed significantly as judged by diffuse nucleoplasmic labelling of dapi . in contrast approximately of _LOCATION_ from heat treated _PROTEIN_ cells _PROTEIN_ conspicuous dapi positive _LOCATION_ domains . since the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is heat inducible the difference in the compaction degree of chromocentres between wt and _PROTEIN_ in response to heat stress occurring at reflects a potential dosage dependent regulatory effect of _PROTEIN_ . subsequently similar results were observed when _LOCATION_ were extracted from entire plants and examined by fish using oligonucleotide probes that targeted the centromeric bp satellite repeat the major constituent of each chromocentre . these results suggested that the attenuation of heat induced chromocentre decondensation in _PROTEIN_ occurred systemically throughout the plant . given that _PROTEIN_ was also intolerant to sudden heat shock the phenotypes of _LOCATION_ in root cells after heat exposure for at were also examined . again whereas of _LOCATION_ from the wild type showed a diffuse dapi signal of _LOCATION_ from heat shocked _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ compact chromocentres . interestingly chromocentre decondensation could be induced in _PROTEIN_ to a level similar to that in the wild type if the plants were acclimated at for before the heat shock treatment . these observations together with the finding that _PROTEIN_ retained the ability to acquire thermotolerance suggested that the reorganization of chromocentres is a critical response for heat tolerance in plants . to elucidate the association between _PROTEIN_ mediated decondensation of heterochromatin and heat mediated reactivation of tgs the transcript levels of tgs markers for which silencing is known to be alleviated by heat were compared between the wild type and _PROTEIN_ by qrt pcr . initially clear inhibition of the reactivation of the centromeric bp repeat was observed in _PROTEIN_ after exposure for to . the strongest disassociation of the chromocentre in wild type _LOCATION_ was observed at this time point . to determine whether the _PROTEIN_ mutation also affects the transcriptional release of silenced multicopy sequences outside the centromeric core this study next determined the levels of rna from onsen a copia like retrotransposon family and _PROTEIN_ an endogenous repeat that is present in pericentromeric regions . the results again showed clear repression of reactivation in _PROTEIN_ for both sets of repeats after exposure for to . the same also applied to a single copy tgs locus mule which resides outside the constitutive heterochromatic region . again the differences of gene _PROTEIN_ levels between wt and _PROTEIN_ in response to heat stress at occurring after reflects the potential dosage dependent regulatory function of _PROTEIN_ . the effect of the _PROTEIN_ mutation on a transcriptionally silenced transgene was then tested . this was achieved by crossing _PROTEIN_ with transgenic plants that harboured locus which consists of a multicopy silenced marker gene that encodes _PROTEIN_ that can be reactivated by heat stress offspring that contained the locus in the _PROTEIN_ background were isolated for analysis . the results indicated that reactivation of the silenced gus transgene was also suppressed in _PROTEIN_ as revealed by qrt pcr for gus transcripts and histochemical staining for gus activity . collectively these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ mediated dissociation of heterochromatin is necessary although it might not be sufficient for the heat stress induced reactivation of tgs loci _PROTEIN_ of whether these loci are endogenous or exogenous or exist as a single copy or repeats or where they are located in the genome .
