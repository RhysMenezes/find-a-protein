s adenosyl l methionine dependent rrna dimethylases mediate the methylation of two conserved adenosines near the end of the rrna in the small ribosomal subunits of bacteria archaea and eukaryotes . proteins related to this family of dimethylases play an essential role as transcription _PROTEIN_ in fungal and animal mitochondria . human mitochondrial rrna is methylated and human mitochondria contain two related mttfbs one proposed to act as rrna dimethylase the other as transcription _PROTEIN_ . the _LOCATION_ genome of arabidopsis thaliana encodes three dimethylase/mttfb like proteins one of which _PROTEIN_ is shown here to be imported into mitochondria . transcription initiation by mitochondrial rna polymerases appears not to be stimulated by _PROTEIN_ in vitro . in line with this finding phylogenetic analyses revealed _PROTEIN_ to be more closely related to a group of eukaryotic non mitochondrial rrna dimethylases _PROTEIN_ than to fungal and animal mttfbs . we found that _PROTEIN_ was capable of substituting the e. coli rrna dimethylase activity of ksga . moreover we observed methylation of the conserved adenines in the rrna of arabidopsis mitochondria this modification was not detectable in a mutant lacking _PROTEIN_ . these data provide evidence for rrna methylation in arabidopsis mitochondria and that _PROTEIN_ is the enzyme catalyzing this process .
to screen the arabidopsis genome for sequences encoding mttfb like proteins we queried the genome and est databases with the putative schizosaccharomyces pombe mttfb amino acid sequence and the human and sequences using the blastp and tblastn _METHOD_ available at the national centre for biotechnology information . the search predicted three mttfb/rrna dimethyltransferase like proteins to be encoded by the loci and in arabidopsis . corresponds to the previously characterized _PROTEIN_ gene coding for a _LOCATION_ rrna dimethylase . the putative rrna dimethyltransferase genes at loci and were tentatively designated _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . _PROTEIN_ is predicted to encode a amino acid polypeptide . available est data support alternative splicing of the hypothetical mrna deriving from _PROTEIN_ which would give rise to two different polypeptides of and amino acids . however pcr amplification of the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence from cdna yielded only the splice product coding for the longer of the two predicted products . for _PROTEIN_ a cdna sequence of the expected length was amplified . protein sequence comparisons revealed that the annotated optional _PROTEIN_ intron codes for amino acid sequence motifs that are conserved among rrna dimethylase like proteins _PROTEIN_ . hence further sequence analyses were based on the longer deduced _PROTEIN_ polypeptide . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ display and amino acid sequence similarity to mttfb from s. pombe and s. cerevisiae respectively and of the predicted amino acids are identical when sequences exclusive of the predicted transit peptides are compared . these levels of similarity approximately correspond to those between human and fungal mttfb sequences . similarities of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with each human and are amino acids are for both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ identical with the human sequences . several computer _METHOD_ consistently predict _PROTEIN_ to possess an n terminal transit peptide mediating the import of the protein into mitochondria while _PROTEIN_ might be a _LOCATION_ protein . to experimentally investigate the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ nucleotide sequences encoding the full length and n terminal amino acids of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively were fused in frame to the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ coding sequence . arabidopsis protoplasts were transformed with the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion constructs and transient _PROTEIN_ of the fusion proteins was monitored using confocal laser _METHOD_ microscopy . two plasmids encoding a mitochondrial _METHOD_ or a _LOCATION_ reca _METHOD_ fusion protein were used for reference transformations of arabidopsis protoplasts . protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ displayed green _METHOD_ of small structures resembling the _METHOD_ mitochondria of protoplasts synthesizing _METHOD_ substantiating a mitochondrial localization of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ on the other hand was found to localize to the _LOCATION_ and for the most part enveloped a small globular structure therein which likely corresponds to the nucleolus . these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ does not possess a mitochondrial or _LOCATION_ transit peptide . transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ fusion proteins in arabidopsis thaliana protoplasts . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ gene fragments encoding putative transit peptides were inserted into plasmid pol _METHOD_ to generate vectors driving the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showing _LOCATION_ and mitochondrial _METHOD_ localisation . control constructs code for _LOCATION_ reca _METHOD_ and mitochondrial coxiv _METHOD_ respectively . images were taken by confocal _METHOD_ microscopy . in order to assess the phylogenetic relationships of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and of the _LOCATION_ methyltransferase _PROTEIN_ to established mitochondrial transcription _PROTEIN_ such as yeast and animal mttfbs and to other rrna dimethylases such as e. coli ksga the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ sequences were compared with available mttfb sequences and to a set of sequences of characterized and predicted rrna dimethylases . blast analyses with arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ of all plant genomes available at the joint genome initiative database including cyanidioschyzon merolae chlorella vulgaris ostreococcus tauri ostreococcus lucimarinus volvox carteri chlamydomonas reinhardtii physcomitrella patens and selaginella moellendorffii combined with searches against the ncbi plant est database revealed that _PROTEIN_ like proteins might be restricted to flowering plants . for identified plant dim proteins subcellular targeting was predicted employing the targetp predotar ipsort and multiloc _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . all sequences with high similarity to arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ which are therefore designated _PROTEIN_ in the phylogenetic tree were predicted to contain putative mitochondrial transit peptides . proteins most similar to arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ were predicted to be neither _LOCATION_ nor mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ and are referred to as _PROTEIN_ . notably the physcomitrella genome was found to lack a _PROTEIN_ homologue but encodes two potential dimethyltransferases which best align with plant _PROTEIN_ proteins being predicted to be neither mitochondrial nor _LOCATION_ and containing a putative mitochondrial transit peptide _PROTEIN_ . amino acid sequences were compared using the multalin algorithm and the alignment was refined according to a structure based alignment generated for fungal mttfbs and the bacillus subtilis rrna dimethylase _LOCATION_ . based on the selected sequence blocks indicated in the alignment a bayesian phylogenetic tree was derived . essentially the same tree topology was obtained employing neighbour joining or maximum likelyhood analysis . prediction of subcellular localisations for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and pfc like proteins predictions of targeting to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ cytoplasm or _LOCATION_ by the respective computer _METHOD_ are documented . proteins are designated as follows crpfc chlamydomonas reinhardtii pfc vcpfc volvox carteri pfc otpfc ostreococcus tauri pfc pppfc physcomitrella patens pfc smpfc selaginella moellendorffii pfc pgpfc pinus

bs.informatik.uni tuebingen.de/services/multiloc . phylogeny of mitochondrial transcription _PROTEIN_ and small subunit rrna dimethylases . bayesian phylogenetic analysis from conserved amino acid sequence sections indicated in the amino acid sequence alignment . collapsed branches of orthologous and paralogous proteins from the detailed phylogenetic tree are displayed as triangles . total branch length to the closest and the farthest leaf are used to calculate the length of the triangles . arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and its plant orthologues appear to be most closely related to a group of rrna dimethylases containing the yeast nucleolar rrna dimethylase _PROTEIN_ . therefore they most probably represent _LOCATION_ enzymes a suggestion which would be consistent with computational predictions of the subcellular localization of these proteins and with our _METHOD_ import experiments conducted with arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ . a sister group to plant fungal and animal _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ like dimethylases is formed by the predicted mitochondrial rrna dimethylases of plants including arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ . remarkably amino acid sequence similarities of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to yeast _PROTEIN_ are and respectively and considerably exceed similarities to yeast or animal mttfbs . this is contrasted by similarities of yeast mttfb human and to yeast _PROTEIN_ with only and . the phylogram shows that the presumed plant mitochondrial rrna dimethylases clustering with either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ are decidedly more closely related to _LOCATION_ enzymes of this type notably with the archaeal _PROTEIN_ like proteins at the root of this clade than to fungal and animal mttfbs . on the other hand the mttfb sequences form a common branch with alpha proteobacterial dimethyltransferases as previously described . arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and its plant orthologues compose a distinct group apart from the _PROTEIN_ cluster and from three other well separated groups formed by animal _METHOD_ animal _METHOD_ and the highly diverse fungal mttfbs . in agreement with a recent study the _PROTEIN_ like sequences which likely code for _LOCATION_ dimethyltransferases unexpectedly form a common clade with chlamydial sequences but not with cyanobacterial or mitochondrial dimethyltransferases . given the presence of apparently only one mttfb/rrna dimethylase like protein in plant mitochondria our further experiments were designed to answer the question of whether arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ could play a dual role as a mitochondrial rrna dimethyltransferase and as a mitochondrial transcription _PROTEIN_ . recombinant arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ was prepared in order to assay the protein in vitro for a possible function as cofactor in mitochondrial transcription . _PROTEIN_ fused to an n terminal hexahistidine tag was _PROTEIN_ in e. coli and soluble recombinant protein was enriched from bacterial extracts _PROTEIN_ was similarly prepared so as to have a non mitochondrial rrna dimethylase like protein available for control experiments _PROTEIN_ . in order to confirm the correct folding and native conformation of the recombinant proteins electrophoretic mobility shift assays of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were carried out with mitochondrial dna probes following the protocol described for testing dna binding by human . both arabidopsis proteins were found to bind to dna without showing sequence specificity _PROTEIN_ . it has been demonstrated that the yeast mitochondrial phage type rna polymerase which on its own transcribes double stranded linear dna only non specifically recognizes mitochondrial promoters on a linear dna template when complemented with sc mttfb in in vitro transcription experiments . we therefore used our previously established in vitro transcription system to test if recombinant _PROTEIN_ enabled the arabidopsis mitochondrial rna polymerases rpotm or rpotmp to specifically transcribe from mitochondrial promoters located on linear dna templates . we also examined if in the presence of _PROTEIN_ the two rna polymerases recognized promoters on both linear and supercoiled dna that in our earlier study were not specifically utilized by any of the two enzymes . recombinant rpotm and rpotmp were assayed for transcription initiation at several mitochondrial promoters in the presence or absence of equimolar amounts of _PROTEIN_ in order to discern non specific effects of _PROTEIN_ addition control reactions were set up with _PROTEIN_ . shows the _PROTEIN_ analysis of transcripts synthesized in vitro from linear or supercoiled dna templates containing the mitochondrial promoters and and or and . rpotm did not specifically transcribe from any mitochondrial promoter on a linear dna template in the presence or absence of _PROTEIN_ neither did the enzyme show increased mitochondrial promoter specificity due to _PROTEIN_ addition when supercoiled templates were provided . none of the promoters not utilized by rpotm in the absence of _PROTEIN_ like or was recognized when _PROTEIN_ was added . the transcriptional activity and initiation specificity of rpotmp were similarly unaltered by the addition of _PROTEIN_ no significant promoter specificity of this enzyme was seen in the presence or absence of _PROTEIN_ with any mitochondrial promoter tested . in addition to the three dna templates analysed as shown in several other dna templates with different promoters were tested . promoter recognition assays are summarized in _PROTEIN_ . altogether the addition of _PROTEIN_ appears to have no effect on rpotm or rpotmp driven transcription . promoter recognition by rpotm in vitro to determine if the _PROTEIN_ protein is a functional rrna dimethyltransferase the complementation of an e. coli mutant lacking the adenine dimethyltransferase encoded by the ksga gene was investigated . the bacterial strain was assayed for complementation by the introduced _PROTEIN_ gene from arabidopsis . this strategy essentially follows the complementation assays as described by et al . for complementing ksga deficient e. coli with human . adenine methyltransferase activity in . coli was recovered when the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ gene was introduced indicating that _PROTEIN_ indeed is a functional and site specific rrna dimethylase . in both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ used with the _PROTEIN_ gene activated either from the lacz promoter or from the promoter adenine methyltransferase activity was observed . in the lacz system the methylating enzyme activity _METHOD_ to be weaker than in the system which may be caused by the weaker promoter and the resulting lower level of protein _PROTEIN_ . in the system an extra primer extension product terminating at _PROTEIN_ is observed . in the bacterial small ribosomal rrnas such an modification at position _PROTEIN_ has been reported . however the correspondence of this extension product with this modification needs to be confirmed by further analysis . the _PROTEIN_ gene from arabidopsis thaliana can complement site specific methylation defects in e. coli . the coding sequence of the _PROTEIN_ gene from arabidopsis thaliana was cloned into vectors driving transcription in e. coli from either a lacz or a promoter as indicated in the scheme and introduced into the e. coli strains or lacking the ksga gene . the specific adenosine dimethylation in the terminal stem loop structure of the bacterial rrna is depicted on the left . primer extension in the presence of ddatp _METHOD_ the absence of this methylation in the mutant bacteria and yields no signal at the adenosine doublet but terminates primer extension at the next uridine in the rrna sequence . introduction of a functional ksga gene or either of the _PROTEIN_ constructs of the _PROTEIN_ gene from arabidopsis restores the methylation signal at the adenosine dinucleotide . the left part of the gel image shows the corresponding rna sequence reactions for orientation of the ddatp termination signals . these complementation assays show that the _PROTEIN_ protein encoded by the _PROTEIN_ gene is an active adenine methyltransferase which modifies the aa dinucleotide at the bacterial rrna nucleotides and the positions equivalent to the plant mitochondrial rrna nucleotides and . to analyse the functional importance of this modification the requirement of the _PROTEIN_ gene for plant growth was investigated . a mutant line of arabidopsis that contains a t dna fragment inserted in the second exon of the _PROTEIN_ gene and designated as _PROTEIN_ was employed to analyse the role of _PROTEIN_ in mitochondrial rna metabolism . the mutation had no apparent effect on plant growth or development under standard growth conditions . as reverse transcriptase is unable to extend a dna oligonucleotide primer if it encounters an adenosine dimethylated at the n position of the base we used primer extension to distinguish between the modification states of wild type and _PROTEIN_ rrnas . as shown in primer extension was inhibited at positions suggesting modification of the mitochondrial rrna at these nucleotides in the wild type . this signal was absent in rna from the homozygous insertion line _PROTEIN_ where reverse transcription did continue uninhibited to position . these results indicate that the conserved modification of two adenosines at the end of the ssrrna is present in the rrna of arabidopsis wild type mitochondria and that _PROTEIN_ plants lack this methylation confirming that _PROTEIN_ is essential for methylation of the adenosine dinucleotide . arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ plants lack adenosine modification of the mitochondrial rrna . sequence and predicted structure of the end of the mitochondrial small subunit rrna the arrow indicating the reverse complementary primer used in the assay . poisoned primer extension products using wild type and arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ plants in which the _PROTEIN_ gene is disrupted . in wt plants ddatp incorporation into the cdna strand at the methylated adenosine doublet results in a strong termination signal at these nucleotides and only a weak read through signal at the next uridine . in the _PROTEIN_ mutant no termination is detected at the adenosines and the read through signal is increased .

obtained from the gabi kat collection . plants homozygous for the mutation were identified by pcr analysis of a segregating population . segregation analysis showed the mutant trait to be inherited in a monogenic fashion . sequencing of t dna borders identified the insertion site within exon of the genomic _PROTEIN_ sequence on chromosome v nucleotides downstream of the _PROTEIN_ initiation start codon in the cds . from the selfed line we selected a homozygous mutant by pcr analysis and named it _PROTEIN_ . the presence of a single t dna insertion in _PROTEIN_ was shown by southern blot

alignment sequences were subsequently imported into geneious . a multiple protein sequence alignment was generated using clustalw implemented in the geneious package using gonnet cost _PROTEIN_ with gap open cost set to and gap extend cost set to . the alignment was refined manually with respect to the known secondary structural homology and poorly aligned regions were excluded from following analyses . for a phylogenetic reconstruction based on bayesian statistics the mrbayes program version was used . in addition maximum likelihood and neighbour joining analysis implemented in the geneious package were conducted . sequences encoding amino acids of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and amino acids of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were amplified from reverse transcribed mrna enriched arabidopsis rna
