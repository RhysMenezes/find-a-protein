this study presents an analysis of the stromal proteome in its oligomeric state extracted from highly purified chloroplasts of arabidopsis thaliana . proteins mostly assembled in oligomeric complexes were identified by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ with emphasis on distinguishing between paralogues . this is critical because different paralogues in a gene family often have different subcellular localizations and/or different _PROTEIN_ patterns and functions . the native protein _METHOD_ were determined for all identified proteins . comparison with the few well characterized stromal complexes from a. thaliana confirmed the accuracy of the native _METHOD_ determination and by extension the usefulness of the native _METHOD_ data for future in depth protein interaction studies . resolved protein interactions are discussed and compared with an extensive collection of native _METHOD_ data of orthologues in other plants and bacteria . relative protein _PROTEIN_ levels were estimated from spot intensities and also provided estimates of relative concentrations of individual proteins . no such quantification has been reported so far . surprisingly proteins dedicated to chloroplast protein synthesis biogenesis and fate represented nearly of the total stroma protein _METHOD_ . oxidative pentose phosphate pathway glycolysis and calvin cycle represented together about nitrogen assimilation represented and all other pathways such as biosynthesis of e.g . fatty acids amino acids nucleotides tetrapyrroles and vitamins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ each represented less than of total protein _METHOD_ . several proteins with diverse functions outside primary _PROTEIN_ metabolism such as the isomerase _PROTEIN_ lipoxygenase involved in jasmonic acid biosynthesis and a _PROTEIN_ anhydrase _PROTEIN_ were surprisingly abundant in the range of of the total stromal _METHOD_ . native images with associated information are available via the _LOCATION_ proteome database .
purified intact chloroplasts were lysed under non denaturing conditions and chloroplast stromal proteins and protein complexes were separated based on native _METHOD_ using _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ followed by complete denaturation and separation by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . proteins were visualized by _METHOD_ staining of preparative gels for _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis or by sypro ruby staining of analytical gels for quantification . the smaller figures are from independent preparations and show that these _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gel patterns are reproducible supporting the notion that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gels are an excellent tool for proteome analysis . proteins were identified by maldi tof _METHOD_ peptide _METHOD_ fingerprinting and/or nano lc esi _METHOD_ followed by mascot search against the tair database . in the analysis of the _METHOD_ data an effort was made to distinguish between members of the same gene family . these search results were automatically filtered using an in house software followed by manual verification and additional quality control steps as detailed under experimental procedures. non redundant proteins were identified on the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gels _PROTEIN_ . the identified proteins were classified according to the hierarchical non redundant classification system developed for mapman adjusted after in house manual verification and information from the literature . the mapman system has _PROTEIN_ functional categories or bins with a larger number of subbins . to our surprise proteins involved in folding proteolysis and sorting represented the largest functional category in the stroma closely followed by proteins related to protein synthesis . of the identified proteins were involved in secondary metabolism covering amino acid metabolism nucleotide synthesis and degradation tetrapyrrole synthesis and enzymes involved in synthesis of vitamins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ isoprenes jasmonic acid and lipids/fatty acids . as expected proteins involved in primary _PROTEIN_ metabolism such as the calvin cycle oppp and glycolysis represented a population of significant number and abundance representing of the total stroma _METHOD_ as determined from the relative spot intensities . enzymes involved in starch synthesis and degradation were also well represented . the function of of the identified proteins was unknown _PROTEIN_ . cross correlation of the identified proteins against other plant proteomic studies on a. thaliana _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and tonoplast the _LOCATION_ the _LOCATION_ the cell wall and the hydrophobic mitochondrial _LOCATION_ and a dozen other mitochondrial proteome analyses did not suggest obvious contaminants from non chloroplast locations . further analysis suggested two to four potential contaminants from the _LOCATION_ and mitochondria as indicated in the supplemental table . in agreement with the low number of contaminants of the identified _LOCATION_ encoded proteins were predicted to be _LOCATION_ localized . this is slightly higher than the reported sensitivity for targetp and indicative of the high quality of this stromal data set . targetp prediction for each protein is listed in the supplemental table . seven proteins were chloroplast encoded . about were not observed in earlier a. thaliana chloroplast proteomic studies on the _LOCATION_ and envelope _LOCATION_ and their associated proteins _PROTEIN_ . predicted functions of these newly identified proteins include biosynthesis of amino acids nucleotides and proteins as well as secondary metabolism and numerous proteins were without any predicted function . a significant number of proteins were listed in the chloroplast analysis described in ref . citation . however this dataset is problematic because it appears to contain a large percentage of non chloroplast proteins as also reflected in the low percentage of chloroplast predicted proteins . this is either a consequence of experimental contaminants and/or the result of high rates of false identifications during the search with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ data . an important aspect of understanding _LOCATION_ function is to determine the _PROTEIN_ level and molar ratios between different _LOCATION_ proteins in addition to their identification . currently there is very little knowledge of the relative accumulation levels of the proteins in the chloroplast stroma . to this end we quantified all protein spots from analytical sypro ruby stained _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gels of two independent chloroplast purifications and normalized those to total spot intensity of each gel . proteins were identified in spots representing of the total spot intensity . as is apparent from the gel images in fig . just a handful of protein spots represent a large percentage of the total protein _METHOD_ of the stroma . the most abundant stromal proteins or based on relative normalized concentration _METHOD_ are listed in table ii . together they represent of the total stromal protein _METHOD_ and their _PROTEIN_ covers a dynamic range of orders of magnitude . these proteins were also prominent from independent shotgun nano lc esi _METHOD_ analysis of the we will discuss these relative abundances further below in connection with protein interactions and protein function . we do point out however that protein abundance was calculated from sypro ruby stained spot intensity . because sypro ruby binds preferentially to charged residues protein abundance is underestimated or overestimated if the proteins contain few or many charged residues respectively . as a first step in understanding the protein protein interaction network of the chloroplast stromal proteome we determined the native _METHOD_ of the identified proteins on the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gels . the gels were calibrated with commercial native standards . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gels resolved proteins in a molecular _METHOD_ range from to kda with ribosomes and other large protein complexes accumulating in the stacking gel in the first dimension . to compare these native _METHOD_ data with existing data we extensively searched the literature for _METHOD_ information on closely related and more distant orthologues in and outside of _LOCATION_ . _METHOD_ information from various species was found for proteins of the identified on our _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gels together representing different monomeric proteins or protein complexes . for of those identified proteins the native _METHOD_ deduced from the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gels is in approximate agreement with data from the literature . the native _METHOD_ and estimated oligomeric state and references for selected proteins are listed in table iii . the complete dataset is available in the supplemental table . thus our comprehensive experimental native data provide a resource and starting point when searching for potential stromal protein partners . one of the biggest surprises when searching the literature was that about of the proteins were identified as homo oligomeric complexes or monomers rather than heteromeric complexes . the potential significance will be discussed . in the remaining sections we will highlight novelties and new insights concerning specific proteins and protein complexes in _METHOD_ of their relative abundance native state and functions . to facilitate comparison of relative abundances of different proteins the spot volume for each accession was divided by its denatured molecular _METHOD_ resulting in a relative concentration . given the inaccuracies and pitfalls of quantification from spot intensities we simplified these relative concentrations to a scale of with each level representing order of magnitude . this provides an immediate impression of the accumulation levels of the different functional categories as a group and for individual proteins within a functional class . we experimentally identified proteins associated with the calvin cycle glycolysis oppp and photorespiration representing about of the total stromal protein _METHOD_ . the relative concentrations of these proteins ranged from level to with the small and large subunits of rubisco _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ at level the other enzymes of the calvin cycle mostly at levels and and specific enzymes of glycolysis and opp at levels . we also identified phosphoglycolate phosphatases and involved in photorespiration at level as a dimer . the rubisco complex needs to be activated by the reversible _PROTEIN_ of a lysine residue in _PROTEIN_ followed by rapid binding of magnesium . this process is regulated by rubisco activase _PROTEIN_ . the relative concentration of _PROTEIN_ was about times less than _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . rubisco n methyltransferase catalyzing n methylation of _PROTEIN_ was times less abundant than rubisco . many of the enzymes in these three pathways form hetero or homo oligomeric complexes . the kda rubisco complex is the most abundant and well studied example and _METHOD_ a hetero oligomer with eight small and eight large subunits . _PROTEIN_ was found in different native _METHOD_ complexes and is known to transiently associate with the rubisco complex . sedoheptulose/fructose bisphosphate aldolase and were both found at kda suggesting a homo or heterotetrameric state . these aldolases are reported to form stromal homotetramers whereas aldolases outside the chloroplast form dimers . starch and minor _PROTEIN_ metabolism contribute to the _PROTEIN_ storage and sugar diversity in _LOCATION_ . we identified proteins in this functional category with relative _PROTEIN_ levels ranging from levels to . these included two adp dependent pfkb _PROTEIN_ kinases and sexi involved in starch phosphorylation control . _PROTEIN_ phosphorylase involved in phosphorolytic starch breakdown _METHOD_ a homodimer or heterodimer . we identified it on the stroma native gels at kda corresponding to a dimer . isoamylase a starch debranching enzyme of the hydrolytic or amylolytic pathway was found in the stroma as a monomer . aldose epimerase catalyzes the interconversion of the and anomers of hexose sugars such as _PROTEIN_ and galactose . aldose epimerase acts as a dimer in aspergillus niger and was indeed found on the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gel at kda . this functional class was represented by just five proteins in agreement with the _PROTEIN_ that these are mostly mitochondrial functions or present in different subcellular compartments _PROTEIN_ . we identified two types of malate dehydrogenases _PROTEIN_ differing in the choice of cofactor and activation mechanism . chloroplast nadp _PROTEIN_ catalyzes the reduction of oxaloacetate into l malate and is involved in the export of reducing power from the chloroplast to the _LOCATION_ . we identified it predominantly at kda and to a lesser extent at kda . chloroplast nadp _PROTEIN_ was suggested to form a homodimer and we identified it at kda . the accumulation level of the nadph form was higher than the nad form in agreement with enzyme activity assays on purified arabidopsis chloroplasts . the arabidopsis genome encodes some different _PROTEIN_ anhydrases . we identified an abundant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ anhydrase _PROTEIN_ at multiple native _METHOD_ between and kda in agreement with observations of homo octa and decameric states . a second paralogue _PROTEIN_ was identified ambiguously with _PROTEIN_ at low levels . _LOCATION_ play a vital functional role in sulfur and nitrogen assimilation with both elements used in amino acid biosynthesis . chloroplasts import nitrite which is converted by fd dependent nitrite reductase into ammonia followed by the glutamate and _PROTEIN_ dependent conversion into glutamine by glutamine synthase _PROTEIN_ and subsequent conversion into glutamate by fd and ketoglutarate dependent glutamate synthase _PROTEIN_ . we identified and quantified each of these three key enzymes as a monomer and at different native _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ appears to have a high relative concentration in particular as compared with nir . this is logical because of the glutamine synthesized in leaf chloroplasts is derived from photorespiration rather than by chloroplast import of nitrate and subsequent reduction to nitrite . _PROTEIN_ sulfurylase _PROTEIN_ catalyzes the formation of adenosine phosphosulfate from inorganic sulfate and _PROTEIN_ . four paralogues _PROTEIN_ are predicted to localize to non green and/or green _LOCATION_ in a. thaliana . _LOCATION_ and chloroplast _METHOD_ were purified from spinach leaves and their native _METHOD_ was about kda as determined by gel filtration subsequent to other fractionation steps . we detected _PROTEIN_ at low levels in the stroma with a native _METHOD_ between and kda . we identified proteins involved in amino acid metabolism representing about of the stromal protein _METHOD_ . they were typically _PROTEIN_ at levels and . literature searches for their oligomeric state suggest that most of these accumulate as dimers and trimers in different plant species and indeed these proteins were found in this _METHOD_ range . as an example we mention the _PROTEIN_ synthetase large and small subunits . in aquifex aeolicus and in escherichia coli they were reported to form a heterodimer of kda . in appears that this oligomeric state is conserved in a. thaliana chloroplasts because we found both subunits with a native _METHOD_ between and kda corresponding to a heterodimer . we identified six proteins involved in lipid/fatty acid biosynthesis all of them at low levels clearly less abundant than proteins involved in e.g . amino acid biosynthesis . these include acetyl coa synthetase generating acetyl coa from acetate accase and one of the three ketoacyl _PROTEIN_ synthases _PROTEIN_ as well as two desaturases stearoyl _PROTEIN_ desaturases and . _PROTEIN_ is an essential enzyme involved in the construction of unsaturated fatty acid _PROTEIN_ skeletons and we identified it at kda . accase catalyzing the first committed reaction of de novo fatty acid biosynthesis _METHOD_ a heterotetrameric enzyme with _LOCATION_ coded subunit _PROTEIN_ biotin _PROTEIN_ carrier biotin _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . we did not identify these additional subunits most likely because they are primarily associated with the inner envelope _LOCATION_ . we identified two proteins in _LOCATION_ isoprenoid biosynthesis from the non mevalonic acid or methyl d _LOCATION_ phosphate pathway . these were diphosphocytidyl methyl d _LOCATION_ synthase _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ immediately downstream in the pathway . both accumulated at level _PROTEIN_ was only recently localized to _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ was identified at kda on the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gel probably forming a dimer . plant hormones such as jasmonic acid gibberellic acid and abscisic acid and products of the terpenoid pathway are in part synthesized in _LOCATION_ . we identified lipoxygenase _PROTEIN_ involved in jasmonic acid synthesis with a predominant native _METHOD_ of kda corresponding to a monomer . it is surprisingly abundant here quantified with a relative concentration of level . we also identified it with high mascot scores in an earlier study as a _LOCATION_ associated protein . it was shown that chloroplast localized _PROTEIN_ is required for the wound induced synthesis of the plant growth regulator jasmonic acid in leaves . cofactors and vitamins are synthesized in _LOCATION_ . we identified two _LOCATION_ enzymes involved in thiamine/vitamin _PROTEIN_ biosynthesis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ both accumulating in complexes of and kda respectively . to our knowledge _PROTEIN_ has not been identified earlier in chloroplasts . interestingly we found that _PROTEIN_ was heavily oxidized as evidenced by high levels of methionine oxidation in the _METHOD_ spectrometer . this high level of methionine oxidation was clearly specific for _PROTEIN_ . it should be noted that _PROTEIN_ is dually targeted to both _LOCATION_ and mitochondria using two different translation initiation sites . we also identified dimethyl ribityllumazine synthase involved in vitamin _PROTEIN_ synthesis . it was shown for the _METHOD_ in e. coli and spinach that dmrl synthase is a mer forming an icosaeder of pentamers . in e. coli each subunit is about kda and the complex migrated around kda . we found arabidopsis lumazine synthase at kda corresponding quite well with observations for the bacterial orthologue . we identified nine proteins involved in tetrapyrrole synthesis and interestingly also the red chlorophyll catabolite reductase _PROTEIN_ involved in chlorophyll degradation . together they totaled about of the stromal protein _METHOD_ . porphobilinogen synthase and coproporphyrinogen iii oxidase were reported to form a homo octamer and a homodimer . we identified each on the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gel at and kda which corresponds to these reported oligomeric states . the a and b subunits of glutamyl trna amidotransferase were identified at kda on the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gel strongly suggesting heterotetrameric interactions . an homodimer of kda has been identified in chlamydomonas reinhardtii . many enzymes in _LOCATION_ are activated and deactivated through oxidation/reduction reactions via the thioredoxin system . the thioredoxin family consists of nine proteins grouped in four clusters . we identified five thioredoxins on the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gels was found at around kda and trxx were found at kda and _PROTEIN_ was found at both and kda . most likely they associate transiently with one or more different enzymes but given the proteome complexity and the resolution of the native gels we could not identify their respective partners . this is not surprising because recent affinity studies using modified thioredoxins as bait have shown that the thioredoxins interact with or more chloroplast stromal proteins covering a wide range of functions . we identified proteins involved in oxidative stress responses . some of them were quite abundant such as peroxiredoxins a and b at level . peroxiredoxin iie was identified at a native _METHOD_ of kda whereas the abundant peroxiredoxins a/b were found at multiple native _METHOD_ in agreement with reports from the literature . we also identified several members of the ascorbate and glutathione defense _METHOD_ such as monodehydroascorbate reductase and dehydroascorbate reductase involved in recycling oxidized ascorbate and glutathione reductase . the native data suggest that they might interact with each other in an kda complex corresponding to a heterodimer . _LOCATION_ are a major site for pyrimidine and purine nucleotide synthesis and indeed we identified enzymes in these pathways corresponding to about of stromal protein _METHOD_ . two of them are shared with amino acid biosynthesis . _PROTEIN_ is a nucleotide diphosphate kinase involved in nucleotide metabolism . was reported to form a homohexamer in agreement with an observed native _METHOD_ of kda on the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gels . _PROTEIN_ was predicted by targetp and predotar to be _LOCATION_ localized and was purified from spinach chloroplasts . curiously _PROTEIN_ is proposed to be a signal transducer in phytochrome mediated light signaling co localizing with phytochrome in the _LOCATION_ . in light of the purification from spinach chloroplasts and its significant accumulation level in a. thaliana chloroplasts in this study it _METHOD_ less likely that _PROTEIN_ it is localized in the _LOCATION_ . we were quite surprised to identify so many proteins assigned to bins and together representing about of the stromal _METHOD_ . the relative concentration among these proteins spanned orders of magnitude with _PROTEIN_ as the most abundant protein . _PROTEIN_ is an abundant stromal peptidylprolyl isomerase with demonstrated in vitro rotamase activity but its role is unclear . _PROTEIN_ was found predominantly around kda and may form a hexamer . spinach _LOCATION_ s ribosomes are composed of more than proteins and have a native _METHOD_ of around mda . the stromal s ribosomes migrated just into the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gel with low amounts of other large complexes . we analyzed protein spots in this gel area but the analysis was not exhaustive . nevertheless we identified some s subunits s subunits and a _LOCATION_ specific ribosome associated protein _PROTEIN_ . ribosome associated proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ originally identified in c. reinhardtii ribosomes were each found at three different locations of the stromal _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ native gels in a complex larger than kda most likely associated with s ribosomes at kda and at kda . at kda the only obvious potential partners are ribosomal protein and ribosomal protein . at kda no obvious partners were found suggesting the possibility that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ form a heterotrimer . we identified elongation _PROTEIN_ ef tu et g and ef p as well a new elongation _PROTEIN_ typa/bipa like protein . the bipa like protein was found in a complex over kda likely interacting with ribosomes . in e. coli bipa is required specifically for the _PROTEIN_ of the transcriptional modulator fis and binds to ribosomes at a site that coincides with that of elongation _PROTEIN_ g . elongation _PROTEIN_ ef tu found at multiple native _METHOD_ ranging from to over kda was identified several times with high mascot scores and was abundant suggesting that it has additional functions . indeed an orthologue in maize _LOCATION_ was suggested to also serve as a chaperone in particular during heat stress . we identified several proteins involved in mrna binding and processing/degradation . polyribonucleotide nucleotidyltransferase acts as a exoribonuclease . we identified it in a stromal complex of kda . this protein shows sequence homology to the polynucleotide phosphorylase _PROTEIN_ of the e. coli degradosome . it possibly acts as a homotetramer and not as a hetero oligomer as shown in other non plant eukaryotes . we also identified _GENE_ encoding for a putative nucleotidase with unknown function it was detected at kda in the stroma . _GENE_ encodes a putative dead box rna helicase _PROTEIN_ and was identified on the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ stromal gel in a molecular _METHOD_ complex of > kda . a _LOCATION_ localized _PROTEIN_ was identified in tobacco and a loss of function mutant resulted in variegated leaves and abnormal roots and flowers . in e. coli a dead rna helicase is part of the degradosome along with the _PROTEIN_ the endoribonuclease rnase e and the glycolytic enzyme enolase . _PROTEIN_ in chloroplasts does not seem to be associated with the _PROTEIN_ or _GENE_ mentioned above . chaperones and are most likely in a complex of kda with and . in addition and seem to form a complex at kda without but a potential pitfall is that transketolase is a major spot possibly masking . indeed when analyzing the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gel of the peripheral _LOCATION_ proteins where transketolase is less abundant was detected close to transketolase at kda and most likely _METHOD_ a second type of complex with . and also form complex at kda but we did not detect any grpe in this native _METHOD_ range . grpe and have been shown to form complexes of and kda in chloroplasts of c. reinhardtii and grpe also _METHOD_ homo oligomers . we identified a well resolved complex at kda with and subunits in an approximate ratio . _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ were not part of this kda complex but were found in complexes of kda . a trigger _PROTEIN_ like protein was identified most likely as a dimer . trigger _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ of e. coli prevents misfolding and aggregation of nascent proteins emerging from the s ribosome . the structure of free trigger _PROTEIN_ of vibrio cholerae was determined at resolution as a dimer . the clpp/r core protease complex was detected at kda . it is a hexadecamer composed of two _PROTEIN_ of seven subunits with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in one or more copies associated with two chaperone like proteins named and . oligopeptidase a in the peptidase family and a zinc metalloprotease of the family both have unknown function and accumulated as monomers . a significant number of the identified a. thaliana proteins currently have no obvious function . here we highlight just a few and comment on their native _METHOD_ abundance and functions in non plant species . denelactone hydrolase is a monomeric enzyme in bacteria involved in the degradation of aromatic compounds such as chlorocatechol and has been crystallized from pseudomonas . nothing is known about its substrate in plants . we found a dienelactone hydrolase at kda as monomer . _GENE_ and _GENE_ are kda paralogues and encode for a putative _LOCATION_ localized mutase likely involved in the formation of c p bonds . in streptomyces hygroscopicus it is involved in the biosynthesis of phosphonates . we identified both proteins in the same spot at a native _METHOD_ of kda it is quite possible that they form trimers . _GENE_ was also identified at kda . the biosynthesis of phosphonate has not been investigated in plants and the only report found in the literature concerns the accumulation of synthase mrna in senescing carnation flower _PROTEIN_ in response to ethylene . the dag gene encodes a kda protein with no obvious functional domains involved in the development of chloroplasts . we identified the dag protein in a high molecular _METHOD_ complex of > kda . the protein _PROTEIN_ involved in _LOCATION_ biogenesis was shown to be present in chloroplasts as well as in _LOCATION_ associated stromules . we originally identified the kda _PROTEIN_ protein under denaturing conditions in the stripped _LOCATION_ proteome and in this study as a kda complex in the stroma . interacting protein partners are unknown .
a. thaliana was grown under h h dark cycles at . rosette leaves were collected about days after sowing . these plants were still in their vegetative stage about week prior to bolting . intact chloroplasts were isolated and the native stromal proteome was collected concentrated and directly loaded on colorless native gels _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as described in ref . citation . the gels were then loaded on tricine _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gels focused and stained with _METHOD_ brilliant blue silver nitrate or the _METHOD_ dye sypro ruby . _METHOD_ stained gels were scanned with a desktop scanner or high resolution scanner and sypro ruby stained gels were scanned using a charge coupled device camera . spot volumes were determined corrected for background and normalized to total spot volume using phoretix software version . we always verified the correlation between predicted processed molecular _METHOD_ and experimentally observed _METHOD_ . in a limited number of cases more than one protein was identified per gel spot . we first verified whether the identities in a spot could be explained by any background signals from abundant proteins in this gel area . such identities from background were not quantified . if it appeared that the identities of the proteins in a spot were truly the results of two co migrating proteins and if the mowse scores were in a similar range then each protein was assigned half the spot volume . if spots contained more than one protein with very different mowse scores _PROTEIN_ we removed the protein identification based on the lowest mowse score . this was a reasonable strategy because co migrating proteins were typically of similar molecular _METHOD_ . in case a protein was identified more than once we summed all corrected spot volumes for that accession . to facilitate comparison of abundance of different proteins the spot volume for each accession was divided by the denatured molecular _METHOD_ for each accession . this resulted in a rough approximation of relative concentration . we do point out that protein abundance was calculated from sypro ruby stained spot intensity . because sypro ruby binds preferentially to charged residues protein abundance is underestimated or overestimated if the proteins contain few or many charged residues respectively . stained protein spots were excised washed and digested with modified trypsin and peptides were extracted automatically . proteins were identified by peptide _METHOD_ fingerprinting using a maldi tof _METHOD_ spectrometer _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and/or by tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ using a capillary lc esi _METHOD_ as described in ref . citation . _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ spectra were used to search the predicted a. thaliana proteome downloaded from the tair database using an in house installation of mascot . criteria for positive identification from peptide _METHOD_ fingerprinting and from _METHOD_ data are described in ref . citation . in the analysis of the _METHOD_ data an effort was made to distinguish between members of the same gene family or otherwise related gene products . in some cases peptides were identified that match to more than one protein . uniquely matching peptides are then needed to determine which protein is _PROTEIN_ . in case the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ data did match ambiguously to more than one protein these protein identifications are automatically linked within the _PROTEIN_ database and reported in the tables . the construction of the _PROTEIN_ was originally described in ref . citation . the _PROTEIN_ interface was improved and search functions were expanded since its inception in . also more detailed curated information can now be accessed . the annotated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gel image and associated experimental predicted and other data presented in this study can be accessed via _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ also contains the theoretical analysis of all arabidopsis entries _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . mascot scores number of matching peptides and highest peptide score for each identification as well as functional classification are listed . chlorophyll concentrations were determined spectrometrically in acetone and protein determinations were done with the bicinchoninic acid assay .
