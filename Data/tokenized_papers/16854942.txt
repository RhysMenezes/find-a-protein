since auxin may elicit numerous developmental responses by the use of a combination of auxin response _PROTEIN_ and their aux/iaa repressors it is important to determine the interaction between the two protein families in a quantitative manner . we transiently _PROTEIN_ the c terminal protein protein interaction domains of arabidopsis arfs _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ fused to _METHOD_ proteins in hela cells and determined their molecular interactions with _METHOD_ cross correlation spectroscopy . almost complete association was found between _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ ctd and between _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ ctd . approximately association was found for _METHOD_ homodimers _PROTEIN_ ctd homodimers and _PROTEIN_ ctd heterodimers . homotypic binding of _PROTEIN_ ctd may be weaker than that of _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ was localized in cytoplasmic compartments in hela cells whereas it was localized in the _LOCATION_ in plant cells . the _PROTEIN_ that the heterotypic interaction between _METHOD_ and arf ctds is stronger than each of the homotypic interactions appears to be the molecular basis for tight control of the transcriptional activity of arfs by auxin . these results also show that fccs is useful to examine protein protein interactions especially for transcriptional regulators .
we first estimated maximum cross correlation by measuring the cross correlation of _METHOD_ fused to the _METHOD_ tandem dimer _PROTEIN_ in hela cells . _METHOD_ and tr separately _PROTEIN_ in one cell were also examined for minimum cross correlation . determination with these cell lines resulted in a cross ratio for the maximum cross correlation and a cross ratio for the minimum cross correlation . when _METHOD_ fused to _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ ctd fused to tr a cross ratio was observed . essentially the same interaction was obtained for a reverse combination of fusion proteins _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ ctd and tr _METHOD_ . these values coincided with the maximum value of the cross ratio indicating complete association between _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ ctd . essentially the same results were obtained for the interaction between _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ ctd . on the other hand the cross ratio between _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and tr _METHOD_ was which was significantly higher than the minimum value of the cross ratio . it was also higher than that for interaction between two _METHOD_ proteins only one of which was fused with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . if we assume that the maximum and minimum cross ratios correspond to and association respectively about of _METHOD_ molecules are judged to form a homodimer . values for the homotypic interaction of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ ctd and those for the heterotypic interaction between _PROTEIN_ ctd and _PROTEIN_ ctd were all similar in magnitude to that between _METHOD_ monomers which were significantly larger than the minimum cross ratio . the homotypic interaction between _PROTEIN_ ctd and the heterotypic interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ ctd were also significantly higher than that of the one sided free _METHOD_ protein controls except for the interaction between _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ ctd and free tr . on the other hand the homodimeric interaction between _PROTEIN_ ctd molecules was as weak as that of the one sided free _METHOD_ protein controls suggesting that homotypic interaction of _PROTEIN_ ctd was negligible . when _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was transiently _PROTEIN_ in onion epidermal cells by the use of particle bombardment it was exclusively found in the _LOCATION_ . however _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was seen diffusively in the cytoplasm as well as in the _LOCATION_ when _PROTEIN_ in hela cells . although tr _METHOD_ was also present in both compartments it was excluded from the _LOCATION_ more readily than _METHOD_ _METHOD_ probably due to its larger molecular size than _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was found almost exclusively in the cytoplasm when co _PROTEIN_ with tr _PROTEIN_ ctd which was found in both the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ when _PROTEIN_ alone . these results strongly suggest that _METHOD_ _METHOD_ interacted with tr _PROTEIN_ ctd so strongly that the resultant complexes were efficiently excluded from the _LOCATION_ because of their large molecular size . the subcellular localization of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was not affected by the presence of either tr _METHOD_ or suggesting that there was no significant interaction between the _METHOD_ monomer molecules . essentially the same results were obtained between _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and tr _PROTEIN_ ctd . in this study we were able to determine the protein protein interaction between _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ ctds in a quantitative manner with fccs . almost complete association was observed between _METHOD_ and arf ctds while association was found between _METHOD_ monomers . homodimeric interaction between _PROTEIN_ ctd monomers and heterodimeric interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ ctds are also similar in strength to homodimeric interaction between _METHOD_ molecules . the interaction between _PROTEIN_ ctd monomers may be more subtle . these results imply that aux/iaa and arf proteins primarily exist as a heterodimeric form between the two protein families . when one of them can not find its partner it is often present in a monomeric form homodimeric species and heterodimeric species between arfs are found on fewer occasions . this conclusion is consistent with the observed subcellular localization of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in hela cells which is affected by the _PROTEIN_ of tr _PROTEIN_ ctd but not by tr _METHOD_ . the strong interaction between aux/iaa and arf suggests that transcriptional regulation conducted by arfs is readily modified by the change in aux/iaa level which is under the direct control of the auxin f box receptors . the molecular interaction between aux/iaa proteins and arf ctds has been investigated with the yeast two hybrid system and immunoprecipitation . homotypic interaction of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or its ctd was observed with size exclusion chromatography or electrophoretic and cross linking methods . stronger interaction between _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ ctd than each homodimeric interaction was reported by the use of the yeast two hybrid assay . similar results were obtained between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ ctd and between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . when maximum interaction was evaluated as the activity of the reporter gene in the presence of the transcription _PROTEIN_ in the yeast two hybrid system the interactions between _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ ctd were of the maximum interaction in our previous study . a slightly stronger interaction was detected between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ ctd . furthermore only of the maximum interaction was observed between _METHOD_ monomers . on the other hand _PROTEIN_ formed a homodimer as readily as it produced a heterodimer with _PROTEIN_ ctd . although these results can not be directly compared with those of the present fccs experiments they appear to be in sharp contrast to almost complete association between _METHOD_ and arf ctds and association between _METHOD_ in the fccs study . the difference probably arises from the repressive nature of aux/iaa proteins in transcription which has been well characterized in plant cells . this clearly illustrates the limitation of the yeast system and the marked advantage of the physical fccs method to evaluate protein protein interaction between transcription _PROTEIN_ quantitatively . on the other hand the interaction between _METHOD_ monomers appears to be near the limit of detection for fccs although it would be detected easily by the yeast two hybrid assay if it is not a transcriptional repressor . this _METHOD_ to represent a weakness of fccs . recently the interaction between _METHOD_ fused _PROTEIN_ and ha tagged _PROTEIN_ was examined in planta with immunoprecipitation . when protein extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti ha antibody almost all the _PROTEIN_ was recovered in precipitates indicating that _PROTEIN_ primarily exists as a heterodimer with _PROTEIN_ in flower buds . this is consistent with our observation that _METHOD_ binds to arfs more strongly than it binds to itself . two oncoproteins fos and jun are transcription _PROTEIN_ of the basic region leucine zipper _PROTEIN_ type . since they act as a heterodimer the thermodynamics of their dimerization has been intensively studied . a dissociation constant of nm was reported for their peptides that consisted of the basic dna binding region and leucine zipper motif . baudendistel et al . also investigated the interaction between the whole fos and jun proteins in hela cells with fccs . if we assume that the maximum and minimum cross ratios correspond to and association respectively again of the oncoproteins are estimated to form a heterodimer in hela cells . the maximum cross correlation observed in the present study is much higher than that reported by baudendistel et al . . this _METHOD_ to be due to a few improvements in our experiments narrowing the confocal detection volume for the green channel and brightening _METHOD_ in the red channel by the use of tr instead of _METHOD_ in their work . _PROTEIN_ plant proteins in human cells may also be important because plant proteins artificially _PROTEIN_ in hela cells may interact with each other freely without interference by endogenous arfs aux/iaas or other interacting plant proteins . however this could also be a drawback of our fccs analyses since the protein interaction was observed in a non native environment . in this connection it is interesting to note that the subcellular localization of _METHOD_ in hela cells is totally different from the consistent _LOCATION_ localization of aux/iaas in plant cells reported previously . aux/iaa proteins contain conserved _LOCATION_ localization signals . the results suggest that hela cells may lack efficient molecular machineries to recognize the _LOCATION_ localization signal of plant specific aux/iaas or to transport them into the _LOCATION_ . in conclusion we have shown that fccs is a useful physical technique to determine molecular interaction quantitatively which complements the use of conventional biological or immunochemical approaches . using fccs we show that _METHOD_ mostly exists as a heterodimer with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ ctd in hela cell cytoplasm . the strong association between _METHOD_ and arfs may make it possible for auxin to control the transcriptional activity of arfs tightly through changes in the _METHOD_ level .
the nucleotide sequence for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ ctd was amplified by pcr from cdna using a pair of oligonucleotide primers _PROTEIN_ and gcatgcggacccgggctcgtctactcctct for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and cccgggtgaaacagaagtcttaagatc for _PROTEIN_ ctd and _PROTEIN_ and cccgggccggttaaacgaagtggctga for _PROTEIN_ ctd . all the forward and reverse primers contained sal i and sma i sites respectively at their ends . the pcr product was subcloned into blue digested with eco rv and its sequence was confirmed by sequencing . after digestion with sal i and sma i the inserted dna was cloned downstream of _METHOD_ in _METHOD_ or tr in the tr replaced _METHOD_ . for _PROTEIN_ in onion epidermal cells the nucleotide sequence for _METHOD_ was amplified as described above with the exception of the forward primer caccatggagaaggaaggactcgg . the pcr product was subcloned into pentr d topo . the _METHOD_ gene was amplified by pcr using forward and reverse primers containing sma i and sph i sites respectively at their ends . the pcr product was inserted between the sma i and sph i sites at the end of the _METHOD_ sequence . the dna fragment _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was inserted downstream of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter of the gateway binary vector using lr clonase . _METHOD_ was used for free _METHOD_ . these plasmids were introduced into onion epidermal cells by particle bombardment _PROTEIN_ using gold particles at p.s.i . after incubation in _METHOD_ medium for h the onion cells were examined with a confocal laser scanning microscope _PROTEIN_ . hela cells were grown as described elsewhere . transfection was carried out on lab _PROTEIN_ chambered coverslips with eight wells using fugene . during fccs measurements hela cells were _PROTEIN_ in opti mem i reduced serum medium . fccs measurements were carried out with a which consisted of a cw ar laser and a he ne laser a water immersion objective and two channels of avalanche photodiodes . _METHOD_ and tr were excited at and nm respectively . the confocal pinhole diameter was adjusted to and for the and nm laser lines respectively . the emission signals were split by a dichroic mirror and detected at nm by the green channel for _METHOD_ and at > nm by the red channel for tr . we usually carried out fccs measurements in the condition that ng < nr but that their molar ratio was near one . therefore the ratio of the associated molecules to the sum of the associated and the monomeric molecules corresponded to nc / ng which was given by the cross ratio / . _METHOD_ images of live cells were obtained with an inverted confocal laser scanning microscope _PROTEIN_ using the same laser lines described above . emission signals were detected at nm for _METHOD_ and at > nm for tr by sequential scanning .
