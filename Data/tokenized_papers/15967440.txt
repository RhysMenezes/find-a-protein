the genome of a. thaliana contains three genes that code for proteins sharing the conserved kgkaal domain and other structural features with the potato protein . in this study these genes will be referred to as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . among the three corresponding proteins the _PROTEIN_ protein shows the highest homology to potato while _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ share only and respectively of the amino acid residues with . none of the three proteins was predicted to have a _LOCATION_ localisation signal by the program predictnls . the prediction _METHOD_ ipsort and targetp instead predicted a high probability for n terminal chloroplast transit peptides in the case of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ whereas the n terminal portion of _PROTEIN_ could represent a putative mitochondrial import sequence _PROTEIN_ . in order to test whether the putative import signals of the orthologues of a. thaliana are indeed functional chloroplast and mitochondrial import assays with full length s labelled proteins were performed . in the case of _PROTEIN_ a second methionine is encoded at amino acid position that is recognised as an alternative translation start codon by both wheat germ extract as well as rabbit reticulocyte lysate resulting in a double band of the unprocessed precursor form . when isolated chloroplasts were incubated with this precursor protein an additional band arose that was about kda smaller than the initial translation products . this size shift corresponds to the predicted cleavage site at position of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in contrast to the precursor this protein was not sensitive to digestion by the protease thermolysin indicating that this band represents the imported mature form of _PROTEIN_ that is protected by the chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ from digestion . the incubation with mitochondria on the other hand did not result in the production of a smaller processed form of the precursor . we therefore conclude that the predicted _LOCATION_ transit peptide of _PROTEIN_ can efficiently and selectively promote the import of this protein into _LOCATION_ . in contrast the full length translation product of _PROTEIN_ yielded processed lower molecular weight products after incubation with mitochondria as well as with chloroplasts . while the size of the mitochondrial cleavage product corresponded to the expected molecular weight of mature _PROTEIN_ as deduced from computer predictions a significantly smaller cleavage product was observed after incubation with chloroplasts . in the recent past many proteins were identified that are targeted to more than one compartment . in order to test whether _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ might be dually targeted to their respective organelles as well as to the _LOCATION_ their coding regions were fused to the _METHOD_ gene and put under the control of the camv promoter . isolated protoplasts from potato leaves were transformed with these constructs by peg mediated transformation . in protoplasts _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein the green _METHOD_ of the _METHOD_ clearly co localised with the red _METHOD_ of the chlorophyll demonstrating that this protein was efficiently targeted to the chloroplasts . within the chloroplasts _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was not equally distributed but appeared in speckles . dapi staining of the dna in these protoplasts confirmed that there is no indication for a translocation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ into the _LOCATION_ . in protoplasts _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in small spots that did not overlap with chlorophyll _METHOD_ but instead resembled the pattern obtained with a control construct containing the import sequence of mitochondrial coxiv fused to _METHOD_ . parallel staining of mitochondria with a specific dye mitotracker orange revealed a co localisation with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ thus confirming that this protein is targeted into the mitochondria . an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct was observed exclusively inside the chloroplasts . in order to ensure that the procedure of protoplast isolation did not affect the localisation of the whirly proteins and to additionally examine their localisation in a different non photosynthetic cell type transformations of onion epidermal cells by particle bombardment were performed with the same _METHOD_ fusion constructs . the results obtained with this approach were in accordance with those obtained with potato protoplasts . the green _METHOD_ emitted from the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins was observed in leucoplasts which despite being smaller in size than the chloroplasts of the potato protoplasts can be clearly identified by their tube like protrusions known as stromules which have been previously described for this type of _LOCATION_ . the distribution of _PROTEIN_ in onion epidermal cells in contrast again resembled that of a mitochondrial control protein coxiv . none of the fusion proteins was observed in the _LOCATION_ of onion epidermal cells . in order to obtain information on the distribution and relatedness of whirly proteins we performed blast searches of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins against translated sequences of the plant est databases . proteins with a high degree of sequence conservation with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ could be thus identified in many dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous species . however no specific homologues of _PROTEIN_ were found . many of the plant species including potato contain homologues for both proteins . we performed predictions of the localisation of why like protein pairs from seven different plant species with psort and targetp . this analysis revealed that in each case one protein _METHOD_ to be targeted to the chloroplast while the other protein contains a putative mitochondrial transit peptide . a phylogenetic tree constructed using the neighbor joining method showed that with the exception of _PROTEIN_ all sequences cluster in two groups . one cluster comprises all _PROTEIN_ like proteins predicted to be targeted to the chloroplasts while the other group consists of the putative mitochondrial homologues . to avoid an influence of the putative signal peptides on the result of this analysis the target peptides as predicted by targetp were removed prior to the sequence comparisons so that the tree represents only the relatedness of the putative mature proteins . the three monocotyledonous plants included in this analysis hordeum vulgare triticum aestivum and oryza sativa share a high degree of identity among each other thus forming a distinct subgroup within each cluster . _PROTEIN_ although containing a potential n terminal signal peptide for chloroplast import shows no extensive homology with the putative _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ like proteins .
for the prediction of chloroplast and mitochondrial transit peptides and the corresponding cleavage sites the _METHOD_ targetp psort and ipsort were employed . homologues of potato and the arabidopsis why proteins from other plant species were identified using the blast program . for the alignment of multiple protein sequences the predicted target peptides were removed and an alignment of the corresponding mature proteins was performed using the _METHOD_ clustalw and dnasis . treeview was employed to create an unrooted phylogenetic tree . the cdna sequences of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from a. thaliana were cloned in a vector behind the promoter of phage rna polymerase . in the case of _PROTEIN_ which does not contain any methionine residues in the predicted mature protein the oligonucleotide coding for six alternating methionine/serine residues _METHOD_ followed by a stop codon was cloned in frame behind the coding sequence . the plasmids were used for coupled in vitro transcription/translation using a kit _METHOD_ and s methionine as labelled amino acid according to the manufacturer s instructions . in vitro translated radioactively labelled precursor proteins were incubated with isolated pea chloroplasts for min as described . import reactions with isolated pea mitochondria were performed essentially according to . upon termination of each import reaction the organelles were recovered by centrifugation resuspended and divided into two equal fractions that were incubated on ice for min in the presence or absence respectively of the protease thermolysin . subsequently the organelles were reisolated from both assays on percoll cushions and subjected to denaturing gel electrophoresis in a polyacrylamide gel . the _PROTEIN_ sequence was amplified by pcr using the cdna and primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ engineered to contain a pst i recognition site . likewise the sequence of _PROTEIN_ was amplified from riken clone using primers _PROTEIN_ and . in case of _PROTEIN_ a fragment including the first exon and bp of the utr was amplified from genomic dna with the primer pair _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . all pcr products were digested with pst i and inserted in frame with the _METHOD_ coding sequence into the vector _METHOD_ bluescript sk . this vector contains a _METHOD_ nos fragment _METHOD_ which was inserted into the pst i and eco ri sites . for constitutive _PROTEIN_ the camv promoter was cloned into the sma i site upstream of the why and _METHOD_ sequences . protoplasts were isolated from weeks old leaves of potato essentially following the protocol of . peg mediated transformations of protoplasts with the recombinant plasmids were performed according to . the protoplasts were incubated for h in the dark at before _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was analysed . for mitochondial co localisation experiments the protoplasts were incubated with a final concentration of nm mitotrackerorange for min in the dark before analysing the _METHOD_ . inner onion peels were placed under sterile conditions on agar plates containing _METHOD_ medium . biolistic bombardments were performed with a _PROTEIN_ instrument . acceleration of gold particles coated with of recombinant plasmid dna was used to transform onion epidermal cells under a vacuum of inches . hg and a helium pressure of psi . the plates containing the bombarded tissue were incubated for h in the dark at . the samples were illuminated with an argon laser _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ using a confocal laser scanning microscope _PROTEIN_ .
