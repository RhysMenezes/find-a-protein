gene models of the _PROTEIN_ family members were sorted according their conserved cysteines with the highest conservation score . based on the top scoring position in the list and the previous suggestion as potentially redox sensitive _PROTEIN_ respectively _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were selected for biochemical confirmation . subsequent analyses showed that _PROTEIN_ localized to the _LOCATION_ under all test conditions and therefore was not further analyzed . for _PROTEIN_ the best hits based on overall sequence identity were selected and a phylogenetic tree was calculated . the tree topology was colored separately for each cysteine of the gene model to depict the conservation status of the cysteine among the different homologues . the tree topology of _PROTEIN_ is shown with the coloring of the putative redox active cysteine _PROTEIN_ . shows the alignment region in vicinity of the redox active cysteines of _PROTEIN_ . the alignments enabled us to determine the conservation status of each cysteine of the gene models in _PROTEIN_ to the homologues . in case of _PROTEIN_ out of the most similar sequences contained the cys . putative _PROTEIN_ homologues were identified in papaya grape and poplar . among the conserved cysteines which might be involved in sensing changes in the redox milieu of the cell by reversible thiol modifications _PROTEIN_ is conserved in dicots whereas _PROTEIN_ only occurred in brassicaceae . in medicago truncatula as in other dicots alternative cys residues exist downstream of the second cys in . for _PROTEIN_ in the dna binding domain and _PROTEIN_ in the c terminal part of the protein were considered as promising candidates for redox regulation by intramolecular disulfide formation . localization studies of _PROTEIN_ were performed as follow up to the in silico analyses and revealed a _LOCATION_ location . in the next step it was explored whether an oxidative stress or heat stimulus might affect _PROTEIN_ localization . under oxidising conditions imposed by h o treatment _PROTEIN_ moved from the _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ within h. _PROTEIN_ was neither partitioned from the _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ upon dtt treatment nor in the untreated control . interestingly heat stress of was also ineffective . according to mittler et al . _PROTEIN_ could sense the h o content inside the cell with single cys or two cys _METHOD_ by reversible thiol modifications . our work addressed this hypothesis by determining the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ under conditions of oxidative stress . to quantify the oxidising effect of externally applied h o a quantification of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in a. thaliana protoplasts in the presence of different h o concentrations was performed . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ increased with rising h o concentrations . the _METHOD_ intensity increased in two phases a sensitive rise below mm h o and a steady rise at higher h o . signal intensity was high after min and slightly _PROTEIN_ at min and further at min . the latter may indicate processes such as decomposition of h o degradation of the _METHOD_ dye or activated defence reactions of the cells . as shown before a. thaliana cell cultures have a high capacity to reduce exogenous h o but it _METHOD_ likely that enough h o was outside to modify the redox state of the _LOCATION_ and to shift the redox state of the thiol /disulfide redox regulatory network to a more oxidising state . thus thiol oxidation appears to trigger the translocation of _PROTEIN_ . little is known about the threshold time delay and concentration of h o needed to activate _PROTEIN_ translocation . this may explain why heat stress despite its effect on cell ros development was unable to initiate _PROTEIN_ translocation to the _LOCATION_ . interestingly miller and mittler failed to observe transcriptional regulation of _PROTEIN_ after heat shock . these results for the time being characterize _PROTEIN_ as redox sensitive but not heat responsive _PROTEIN_ . in the next step we wanted to address the possibility that _PROTEIN_ continuously shuttles between _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . in this scenario oxidative inhibition of export eventually caused by h o could allow for _LOCATION_ accumulation . protoplast samples were supplemented with leptomycin b which inhibits _LOCATION_ export . permanent shuttling and oxidative inhibition of export can be excluded since lmb caused no accumulation of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ . activation of _PROTEIN_ is suggested to involve oligomerisation . therefore the translocation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ upon initiation of oxidative stress was further investigated by exploring oligomerization by in vivo fret analysis . the fret efficiency between fused _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ indicative for _PROTEIN_ protein protein interaction was calculated according to . as shown in b the fret efficiency in the _LOCATION_ increased significantly from which is below the significance threshold of interaction to after adding h o to the protoplasts . the corresponding data of the _LOCATION_ were at mm h o and at mm h o treatment . both values showed a significant difference to the fret control measurement with free _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ revealed no interaction at all in the mm h o treatment which may be caused by the extremely low concentration of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ of untreated cells . unchanged fret efficiency between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ contradicts the hypothesis of trimerisation as prerequisite for activation . chan schaminet et al . reported that _PROTEIN_ oligomers already exist in the cytoplasm of tomato under unstressed conditions . _PROTEIN_ oligomers pre exist in the _LOCATION_ as seen in . the quantitative analysis of the _LOCATION_ localized _METHOD_ _METHOD_ revealed a significant increase of _PROTEIN_ oligomers in the _LOCATION_ after applying mm h o to the cells . this discovery was further explored in dependence on time by quantifying the movement in transfected protoplasts with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the emission intensity of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was quantified along a half transect across the protoplast image or in the _LOCATION_ region of interest . to get a measure for the _PROTEIN_ translocation the maximal _LOCATION_ intensity was divided by the maximal intensity in the _LOCATION_ at the time points as indicated . these ratios were plotted against the exposure time to h o . a significant rise in the intensity ratio between _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ upon h o treatment was observed between t h until h. the intensity versus time curve at lower h o increased roughly linearly with a trend to slow saturation . in contrast the treatment with mm h o caused a rapid rise within the first min and then stayed at a rather constant level . the initial rise was close to twice as fast as in the case of mm h o and the difference to the pretreatment value was already significant at t . these results indicate conformational changes of _PROTEIN_ in vivo . to gain a better insight into how _PROTEIN_ might sense the hydrogen peroxide in the _LOCATION_ a putative homology model was generated with a protein structure prediction tool . the model shows the typical modular structure of _PROTEIN_ . for _PROTEIN_ a putative disulfide bond formation between cys and cys was predicted which would likely cause a drastic conformational change and might induce the translocation to the _LOCATION_ . to _PROTEIN_ this hypothesis variants of _PROTEIN_ namely _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the double mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were generated to test if the two cysteines in _PROTEIN_ are required for the translocation from the _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ under oxidising conditions . protoplasts were transfected with the described constructs and the intracellular distribution of the fusion proteins was monitored under oxidising conditions after h. as shown before _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ wt moved from the _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ . in a converse manner the single mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the double mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ remained in the _LOCATION_ and did not show any accumulation in the _LOCATION_ within h. the widely accepted model of _PROTEIN_ assumes that _PROTEIN_ bind to _PROTEIN_ under non stress conditions . interaction partners of _PROTEIN_ were searched in silico with the interaction viewer and the heat shock protein _PROTEIN_ was predicted to interact with _PROTEIN_ . based on this information and the common _PROTEIN_ model _PROTEIN_ was cloned in an _PROTEIN_ vector and cotransfected with _PROTEIN_ fluorophore fusion constructs into protoplasts . in these experiments fret efficiency between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ reached values of about and thus exceeded that shown in . coexpression of unlabeled _PROTEIN_ did not change this high value since the trend to increased fret was insignificant . subsequently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the swapped fluorophores were tested for interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fret efficiencies of and demonstrated molecular interaction in the _LOCATION_ to confirm the predicted interaction . fret values in the _LOCATION_ were significantly lower . it will be interesting to investigate the effect of oxidative treatment on _PROTEIN_ interaction in the _LOCATION_ in order to advance the mechanistic model . apparently the redox sensing mechanism of _PROTEIN_ was linked to the presence of cys and cys . deletion of either single cys or both abolished ros induced accumulation of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ . the results are in line with the assumption that disulfide bond formation between cys and cys controls the partitioning of _PROTEIN_ between the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ . another possibility could be the formation of intramolecular disulfide bridges stabilizing the dna binding on the one hand and the transcriptionally active module in the ctd on the other hand . several testable explanations may be proposed one explanation could be the unmasking of the _LOCATION_ import sequence upon disulfide bridge formation . alternatively oxidation could mask the export signal . thirdly oxidised _PROTEIN_ might be released from multi heteromeric complexes as proposed for the heat induced activation of _PROTEIN_ . the large intervening amino acid sequence between cys and cys suggests that disulfide bond formation causes profound conformational changes which probably are required for the translocation to the _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ a homologue of the _PROTEIN_ family interacted with _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ . analysis of the dynamics of this interaction in vitro and in vivo may provide further clues on involved structural dynamics . in conclusion our work demonstrates the function of _PROTEIN_ as redox sensor which is able to recognize oxidising conditions in the _LOCATION_ of a single cell and is subsequently translocated to the _LOCATION_ . this sensor may also be used in future experiments to monitor ros and redox signaling in single cells . the regulatory features of other _PROTEIN_ should be investigated for their responsiveness to h o similar to the analysis presented here .
