in this study we report the molecular genetic characterization of the arabidopsis mitochondrial phosphopantetheinyl transferase which catalyzes the phosphopantetheinylation and thus activation of mitochondrial acyl carrier protein of mitochondrial fatty acid synthase . this catalytic capability of the purified mtppt protein _PROTEIN_ was directly demonstrated in an in vitro assay that phosphopantetheinylated mature arabidopsis apo mtacp _METHOD_ . the mitochondrial localization of the _PROTEIN_ encoded proteins was validated by the ability of their n terminal residue leader sequence to guide a chimeric _METHOD_ protein to this organelle . a t dna tagged null mutant mtppt allele shows an embryo lethal phenotype illustrating a crucial role of mtppt for embryogenesis . arabidopsis rnai transgenic lines with reduced mtppt _PROTEIN_ display typical phenotypes associated with a deficiency in the mtfas system namely miniaturized plant morphology slow growth reduced lipoylation of mitochondrial proteins and the hyperaccumulation of photorespiratory intermediates glycine and glycolate . these morphological and metabolic alterations are reversed when these plants are grown in a non photorespiratory condition _PROTEIN_ demonstrating that they are a consequence of a deficiency in photorespiration due to the reduced lipoylation of the photorespiratory glycine decarboxylase .
candidate arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ proteins were identified based on sequence similarity shared with a typical group i _PROTEIN_ and a typical group ii _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . blastp analysis with the e. coli _PROTEIN_ failed to identify any significant arabidopsis homolog possibly indicating the lack of a group i _PROTEIN_ in plants . parallel analysis with bacillus subtilis _METHOD_ identified two significant homologs _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the orfs of _PROTEIN_ were isolated via an rt pcr method with rna template isolated from aerial organs of young seedlings using primers adjoining the predicted _PROTEIN_ start codon and the translational stop codon . the resulting pcr products were cloned and sequence confirmed . three types of orf sequences were recovered _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which are predicted to be products of some type of alternative splicing variant mechanism . based on the ratio of the clones that were recovered these alternative splice variants would appear to accumulate at a ratio of with _PROTEIN_ being the most abundant transcript . the three splicing variants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are the result of alternative slicing that occurs in removing the second intron . in the case of the first two variants alternative nucleotides are _PROTEIN_ in the mature mrna that originate from the second and third exons resulting in proteins of amino acids that differ from each other by the two amino acid residues at positions and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . both of these orfs contain an identical n terminal residue extension as compared with the bacillus subtilis _METHOD_ protein . this extension is rich in basic amino acids and lacks acidic amino acid residues which are features of mitochondrial targeting presequences . analyses with psort targetp and mitoprot ii predict that proteins encoded by orf _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are mitochondrially localized . in contrast the _PROTEIN_ transcript deletes five nucleotides in the splicing of the second intron . translation of the resulting transcript begins at a down stream _PROTEIN_ codon relative to that of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and the resulting protein is residues in length . the _PROTEIN_ protein is therefore smaller than the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins and although the about the same length as the bacillus subtilis _METHOD_ protein the n terminus is truncated relative to the _METHOD_ protein . the start codon of _PROTEIN_ lacks a typical kozak sequence for efficient translation . psort predicts that the _PROTEIN_ protein is cytoplasmically located and targetp and mitoprot ii indicate that it is not targeted to an organelle . the gene model for the second arabidopsis _METHOD_ homolog encoded by _PROTEIN_ predicts a protein that fuses an n terminal _PROTEIN_ interacting protein domain with a c terminal _METHOD_ like _PROTEIN_ domain . the _PROTEIN_ domain of the predicted _PROTEIN_ protein shares similarity and identity with the mtppt protein encoded by _PROTEIN_ . however _PROTEIN_ transcript could not be detected by rt pcr using several _PROTEIN_ specific primer sets with rna templates isolated from many different organs including aerial organs roots flowers siliques and rosette leaves . a t dna tagged mutant allele of _PROTEIN_ was identified in which the insertion resides in the _PROTEIN_ interacting protein domain . in laboratory growth conditions there is no detectable morphological difference between this mutant line and the segregated wild type siblings . given the lack of phenotypic alterations in this mutant and the failure to detect _PROTEIN_ derived transcripts we conclude that this is a pseudogene which may have originated from a gene duplication event of _PROTEIN_ . we therefore primarily focused on defining the functions of the _PROTEIN_ locus . in vitro biochemical assays were performed with the recombinant proteins encoded by all _PROTEIN_ encoded orfs . these assays tested whether these proteins are capable of catalyzing the phosphopantetheinylation of recombinant _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . given the putative mitochondrial localization of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins we purified the mature _METHOD_ of these proteins that lacked the n terminal amino acid residues that were computationally identified as the mitochondrial presequence which is usually removed after import into the organelle . we note that recombinant _PROTEIN_ of the full length _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins in e. coli resulted in their accumulation in the insoluble inclusion bodies whereas the mature _METHOD_ were partially soluble and catalytically active . computational analysis of the full length _PROTEIN_ protein revealed the absence of any n terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence and thus this predicted full length protein was recombinantly _PROTEIN_ in e. coli purified and used in catalytic enzyme assays . as with the two other _METHOD_ of the recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein was recovered in the soluble fraction and purified for enzymatic characterization . the mature _METHOD_ of three recombinant apo mtacp _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were used as substrates in these assays . as illustrated in figure maldi qtof analyses of e. coli _PROTEIN_ mature mtacp _METHOD_ confirm that these protein preparations are recovered primarily in the apo form . to ensure that these apo mtacp preparations are free of any contaminating phosphopantetheinylating enzyme activity each preparation was incubated with coa in the absence of any putative plant derived _PROTEIN_ enzymes and this did not affect the phosphopantetheinylation status of the apo mtacps . however parallel incubations in the presence of recombinant proteins encoded by _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ resulted in the near complete conversion of apo mtacp to holo mtacp . in contrast the recombinant protein encoded by _PROTEIN_ did not affect this phosphopantetheinylation of apo mtacps . these data establish that the proteins encoded by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are functional _PROTEIN_ enzymes that are capable of phosphopantetheinylating all three tested apo mtacp _METHOD_ . the inability of the _PROTEIN_ protein to catalyze this reaction indicates that the n terminal domain which occurs in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins but is missing in _PROTEIN_ is essential for the catalytic function . we also tested whether these _PROTEIN_ proteins can catalyze the phosphopantetheinylation of the pre protein _METHOD_ of mtacps which still contain the n terminal mitochondrial targeting presequence . proteins encoded by all three _PROTEIN_ orfs failed to catalyze this modification reaction with pre apo _PROTEIN_ as the substrate . this result indicates that the leader mitochondrial presequence of _PROTEIN_ inhibits this modification reaction . attempts to similarly test the substrate suitability of pre apo _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ could not be conducted because these latter pre proteins either did not _PROTEIN_ in e. coli _PROTEIN_ or they _PROTEIN_ in insoluble form _PROTEIN_ and could not be recovered for such assays . transgene experiments with _METHOD_ tagged fusion proteins were used to experimentally determine the subcellular localization of the proteins encoded by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ orfs . in these experiments we tested the ability of the n terminal residue peptide coding sequence that is identical for both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins to target the localization of _METHOD_ . figure presents confocal micrographs obtained from the leaf mesophyll cells and roots of the resulting _METHOD_ transgenic plants . chlorophyll _METHOD_ was recorded simultaneously in mesophyll cells and mitotracker orange was applied and recorded in roots . mesophyll cells and roots of the wild type controls do not exhibit any _METHOD_ matching to _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signal was obtained from the mesophyll cells of transgenic plants carrying the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene and this was localized to discrete subcellular organelle like features which are distinct from the chlorophyll _METHOD_ illustrating that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein is not localized to chloroplasts . in contrast the _METHOD_ of the negative control promoter driven _METHOD_ which is known to localize to the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ is distinct from that of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein . examination of the distribution of the _METHOD_ recovered in roots of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants shows a clear overlap with the signals obtained with mitotracker orange . we therefore conclude that proteins encoded by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ localize to mitochondria and this targeting is directed by the n terminal residue leader sequence of these proteins . taken together these results establish that the gene locus _PROTEIN_ encodes a mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ enzyme which phosphopantetheinylates the mature apo mtacp _METHOD_ but can not phosphopantetheinylate pre apo mtacp . hence the phosphopantetheinylation of mtacp is a process that has to occur within the organelle following import from the _LOCATION_ . blastp analysis of the predicted proteomes of different plant species whose genomes are sequenced was conducted by using the query amino acid sequence of the arabidopsis mtppt protein encoded by orf _PROTEIN_ . these analyses identified homologs with e values < . figure shows the classification of these plant homologs relative to the amino acid sequences of the characterized _PROTEIN_ enzymes that are known to define five separate clades of this family of enzymes _METHOD_ . plant homologs fall into two of these previously defined clades . the arabidopsis mtppt protein and different plant sourced _PROTEIN_ homologs are associated with the _METHOD_ clade . these _PROTEIN_ homologs are found in all plant genomes that were examined and these occur either as a single copy gene or two significant homologs per genome . in contrast plant _PROTEIN_ like proteins are associated with the clade . these _PROTEIN_ like homologs are not uniformly found in all sequenced plant genomes being absent from arabidopsis thaliana arabidopsis lyrata camelina sativa capsella rubella brassica rapa brassica napus eutrema salsugineum and malus domestica . these _PROTEIN_ like proteins are similar in size to the _LOCATION_ yeast protein and human _PROTEIN_ and computationally they are predicted to be _LOCATION_ . the spatial and temporal _PROTEIN_ pattern of the mtppt gene was determined using two complementary methods qrt pcr and promoter gus transgenic analysis . qrt pcr analysis of rna preparations extracted from different organs shows that the _PROTEIN_ of mtppt gene occurs in all organs tested . there is an approximately two fold difference between highest and lowest _PROTEIN_ levels . in the complementary promoter gus experiment gus _PROTEIN_ was driven by the mtppt promoter that encompasses kb dna sequence upstream of the _PROTEIN_ start codon of orfs _PROTEIN_ . gus activity staining occurs highest in the vascular _METHOD_ of young seedlings and flowers . in the flowers highest gus staining is concentrated in the sepals and stigma whereas activity in _PROTEIN_ and anthers is at lower levels . in the siliques gus activity is _PROTEIN_ focused in the pedicel carpel and septum and activity is lower in the enclosed developing seeds and funiculi . these patterns of mtppt _PROTEIN_ are consistent with the publically available microarray data visualized by the arabidopsis _METHOD_ browser . the physiological significance of the mtppt gene was investigated by segregating and analyzing three t dna tagged mutant alleles . these alleles which were identified by searching the salk insertion sequence database were obtained from nasc or _PROTEIN_ . molecular details of these three alleles are provided in figure . the t dna insertions in alleles mtppt and mtppt are located in the utr area of the mtppt gene . qrt pcr analyses show that the _PROTEIN_ levels of the mtppt mrna is unaffected by these insertions and these mutants do not exhibit any detectable phenotype . in contrast the t dna inserted in the mtppt allele is located in the second exon . upon selfing heterozygous lines that carry the mtppt allele no homozygous mutant progeny could be recovered . however homozygous wild type and heterozygous progeny were recovered at a ratio of . the chi squared test indicates that this ratio is consistent with the mendelian segregation of a recessive homozygous lethal allele . indeed examination of developing seeds within siliques of individual heterozygous plants displays an atypically large number of aborted or aborting seeds . in the siliques of mtppt heterozygous plants approximately of the fertilized seeds aborted during development whereas no such aborted seeds were observed in the wild type sibling plants . based on the near segregation ratio of normal versus aborted/aborting seeds in the siliques of mtppt heterozygous plants we deduce that the aborted/aborting seeds are due to the mtppt genotype being consistent with an embryo lethal phenotype . differential interference contrast microscopy was used to analyze the progression of embryogenesis in the aberrantly developing seeds in the siliques of mtppt heterozygous mutant plants and these were compared to the normally developing seeds in the wild type siblings . while normal embryo development is observed in the seeds of the latter development of the embryos in the white aborting seeds of the mtppt heterozygous plants are arrested at the globular stage . transgenic complementation with the mtppt _METHOD_ transgene was conducted to directly test whether the embryo lethal phenotype is due to the mtppt allele . this transgene was transformed into heterozygous mtppt plants and segregants were recovered and genotyped at the generation . seven of these recovered plants were homozygous for the mtppt allele all of which also carried the mtppt _METHOD_ transgene . three of these seven plants were visually indistinguishable from wild type plants grown under the laboratory conditions the vegetative growth of other four recovered plants was also normal but no seeds were recovered . these findings therefore establish that the ectopic _PROTEIN_ of the mtppt _METHOD_ transgene complements the embryo lethality of the mtppt allele enabling the recovery of mature normal growing plants that are homozygous for the mtppt allele . the phosphopantetheinylation of mtacp fulfills the need to support mtfas function . we envisioned therefore that the embryo lethal phenotype associated with the mtppt allele may be rescuable by chemical complementation as is the case with mutations in the mtkas gene . specifically the latter mutations are rescuable by growing plants in an elevated _PROTEIN_ atmosphere which overcomes the photorespiration deficiency associated with the inability to produce sufficient lipoic acid cofactor for glycine decarboxylase complex . we therefore attempted to grow heterozygous mtppt plants in the presence of external chemicals which may be able to overcome this deficiency specifically a _PROTEIN_ atmosphere or watering plants with a lipoic acid solution . figure shows developing seeds within siliques of sibling plants grown in the _PROTEIN_ atmosphere that are either wild type or heterozygous for the mtppt allele . whereas all seeds matured normally in the wild type plants about of the seeds in the mtppt mutant plants failed to develop normally as occured when these plants were grown in a normal atmosphere . similar data were obtained with plants watered with lipoic acid . although the latter findings may be explainable by the inability of the plant to uptake and transport lipoic acid to the site required to rescue embryo development the _PROTEIN_ that the elevated _PROTEIN_ atmosphere could not overcome this deficiency indicates that phosphopantetheinylated mtacp and thus possibly mtfas play a crucial role in the successful development of viable embryos . because of the embryo lethality associated with the mtppt allele we were unable to analyze the role of mtppt function during post embryogenesis via the characterization of this allele . as an alternative we generated rnai transgene knockdown plants which _PROTEIN_ a promoter driven suppressor of the mtppt gene . thirty two independent rnai lines were recovered and the levels of mtppt transcript were evaluated by qrt pcr in the aerial organs of young seedlings at days after imbibition . two transgenic lines which exhibit the lowest mtppt _PROTEIN_ levels and of wild type levels were designated as mtppt rnai and mtppt rnai respectively . these two mutant stocks exhibit a significantly reduced aerial organ size as compared to the wild type plants when they are grown in ambient air . growing these plants in an atmosphere enriched in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ reversed this reduced size of the aerial organs . as previously reported this phenotypic reversal by the _PROTEIN_ atmosphere is a trait typical of deficiencies in photorespiration the elevated _PROTEIN_ inhibiting synthesis of phosphoglycolate by ribulose bisphosphate _PROTEIN_ . a similar photorespiratory phenotype also occurs in mutants that affect the mtfas system which is associated with the under lipoylation of h subunit of gdc . we performed metabolic profiling analyses on the mtppt rnai mutant stocks focusing on the role of mtppt in the mtfas system . because mtfas generates the fatty acid precursor for lipoic acid biosynthesis and the mtppt rnai phenotype suggests a link to photorespiration via lipoylation of gdc we _PROTEIN_ focused these analyses on determining protein lipoylation and levels of fatty acids amino acids glycolate and sucrose . the protein lipoylation in the mtppt rnai mutants was examined by western blot analysis with anti lipoic acid and anti h protein antibodies . to eliminate the bias associated with the morphological appearance of the mtppt rnai mutants all plants used for these analyses were grown in the _PROTEIN_ atmosphere where the mtppt rnai associated growth differences are eliminated . analysis of protein extracts from wild type and mtppt rnai mutants by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ indicate that there are no dramatic differences in the _PROTEIN_ proteomes of these two sibling lines but differences are revealed with more discriminating assays . the most dramatic alteration is the depletion of the lipoylation of h protein subunit of gdc . specifically whereas the immunologically detected levels of the h protein is unchanged in the two mtppt rnai mutants the lipoylation status of gdc is reduced to about of wild type levels . these western analyses also revealed additional three lipoylated proteins that occur in mitochondria and _LOCATION_ the subunits of mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase and ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and subunit of the _LOCATION_ pdh the subunit of branched chain ketoacid dehydrogenase was not detectable . only the lipoylation of the mitochondrial proteins were reduced in the mtppt rnai mutants but lipoylation of the subunit of the _LOCATION_ pdh was unaffected . these results substantiate that the mtfas system generates the fatty acid precursor needed for lipoic acid biosynthesis which appears to be restricted specifically for mitochondrial lipoylated proteins the source of lipoic acid for the lipoylation of _LOCATION_ protein occurs via a route that is independent of mtppt and thus independent of mtfas . metabolite profiles of the mtppt rnai mutants show the disturbed metabolic state of these plants when they are grown in ambient air . despite the dramatic effects on growth morphology changes in the most abundant fatty acids in these mutants are subtle which is consistent with the relatively minor role of mtfas in contributing to the overall fatty acid pool of plant cells . the most dramatic metabolite changes are associated with photorespiratory metabolites in accordance with the under lipoylation of gdc which contributes to the photorespiratory conversion of glycine to serine . specifically in the mtppt rnai mutants glycine levels are elevated by about fold glycolate is increased by fold and sucrose levels are _PROTEIN_ to about of wild type levels and several additional amino acids show more moderate alterations in accumulation . when the plants are grown in an atmosphere of _PROTEIN_ where photorespiration is suppressed and growth phenotype of the mtppt rnai mutants is reversed most metabolic alterations also return to the wild type levels the exception being glycine . these findings indicate that the primary metabolic lesion associated with reduced mtppt activity in seedlings is _PROTEIN_ via the under lipoylation of gdc which reduces photorespiration .
