despite much study of the role of s adenosylmethionine in the methylation of dna rna and proteins and as a cofactor for a wide range of biosynthetic processes little is known concerning the intracellular transport of this essential metabolite . screening of the arabidopsis genome yielded two potential homologs of yeast and human sam transporters designated as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ both of which belong to the mitochondrial carrier protein family . the _PROTEIN_ gene is broadly _PROTEIN_ at the organ level although only in specialized tissues of roots with high rates of cell division and appears to be up regulated in response to wounding stress whereas the _PROTEIN_ gene is very poorly _PROTEIN_ in all organs/tissues analyzed . direct transport assays with the recombinant and reconstituted _PROTEIN_ were utilized to demonstrate that this protein displays a very narrow substrate specificity confined to sam and its closest analogs . further experiments revealed that _PROTEIN_ was able to function in uniport and exchange reactions and characterized the transporter as highly active but sensitive to physiologically relevant concentrations of s adenosylhomocysteine s adenosylcysteine and adenosylornithine . green _METHOD_ protein based cell biological analysis demonstrated targeting of _PROTEIN_ to mitochondria . previous proteomic analyses identified this protein also in the chloroplast inner envelope . in keeping with these results bioinformatics predicted dual localization for _PROTEIN_ . these findings suggest that the provision of _LOCATION_ synthesized sam to mitochondria and possibly also to _LOCATION_ is mediated by _PROTEIN_ according to the relative demands for this metabolite in the organelles .
by screening the arabidopsis genome with the sequences of yeast and human samc two homologs have been identified _GENE_ and _GENE_ hereafter named _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ coding sequences were amplified by pcr from an arabidopsis cdna library . they encoded proteins of and amino acids respectively which are identical to one another . the amplified _PROTEIN_ differs from the sequence derived from conceptual translation in that it lacks residues to of the previously annotated sequence . the two novel arabidopsis proteins belong to the mitochondrial carrier family because their amino acid sequences are composed of three tandem repeats of about amino acids each containing two transmembrane helices linked by an extensive loop and a conserved signature motif . however unlike many members of this family including and samc _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ appear to have a presequence of nearly amino acids . they share to identical amino acids with and samc a percentage that increases to to based on the sequences of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ without the first residues . in the arabidopsis information resource database _PROTEIN_ sequence tags were found for _PROTEIN_ whereas no ests were found for _PROTEIN_ . during the preparation of this article an est has been released in the national center for biotechnology information database _PROTEIN_ that corresponds to to bp of the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence except for a few base discrepancies most likely due to the different ecotypes sequenced . taken together these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ at a significantly higher level than _PROTEIN_ although both genes are transcriptionally active . in a preliminary northern blot analysis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was found in flowers leaves _METHOD_ and seedlings whereas no _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was detected . we then determined gene _PROTEIN_ levels by real time reverse transcription pcr using the housekeeping elongation _PROTEIN_ gene as an internal control . in all organs analyzed _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ at higher levels than _PROTEIN_ consistent with digital and conventional northern analyses . the _PROTEIN_ mrna was _PROTEIN_ most strongly in seedlings . it was also _PROTEIN_ in leaves and flowers and to a lesser extent in _METHOD_ and roots . _PROTEIN_ mrna was _PROTEIN_ at comparable low levels in all organs analyzed . these results are in close agreement with the data housed in publicly available microarray data collections except for _METHOD_ where we found a lower level of _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ than that predicted by affimetrix and _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ arrays . to investigate organ specificity in more detail the _PROTEIN_ promoter region was fused transcriptionally to the _PROTEIN_ gene . during the first stage of vegetative growth strong _PROTEIN_ was observed in cotyledons of postgerminating seedlings in the base of the primary root and in the root tips . in young seedlings containing two to four true leaves significant _PROTEIN_ was found along the entire primary root in the base and tips of the _PROTEIN_ roots in the first two true leaves and to a lesser extent in the cotyledons . progressively reduced staining was observed in young and adult leaves on aging and virtually no _PROTEIN_ was found in senescent leaves unless they were wounded or damaged or _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ was however also observed in sepals during the early stage of flower development and in mature flowers . no _PROTEIN_ was found in _PROTEIN_ pollen grains and the central septum of pollen tubes whereas _PROTEIN_ was clearly seen at the stigma of the pollen tubes . furthermore gus _PROTEIN_ was found in the silique vasculature . similar studies performed with _PROTEIN_ did not lead to any significant staining confirming that _PROTEIN_ is very weakly _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins were _PROTEIN_ at high levels in e.coli . they accumulated as inclusion bodies and were purified by centrifugation and washing . the apparent molecular _METHOD_ of the recombinant proteins were about kd . the identity of the purified proteins was confirmed by n terminal sequence analysis . about mg of each purified protein were obtained per liter of culture . the proteins were not detected in cells harvested after induction of _PROTEIN_ but lacking the coding sequence in the vector nor in bacteria harvested immediately before induction . the recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein was reconstituted into liposomes and its transport activities for a variety of potential substrates were tested in homoexchange experiments . using external and internal substrate concentrations of and mm respectively the recombinant and reconstituted protein catalyzed an active sam/sam exchange which was inhibited by a mixture of pyridoxal p and bathophenanthroline . it did not catalyze homoexchanges for phosphate carnitine glu asp met orn malate amp and adp . of importance no sam/sam exchange activity was detected if _PROTEIN_ had been boiled before incorporation into liposomes or if _PROTEIN_ solubilized material was reconstituted from bacterial cells either lacking the _PROTEIN_ vector for _PROTEIN_ or harvested immediately before induction of _PROTEIN_ . in contrast to _PROTEIN_ recombinant and reconstituted _PROTEIN_ showed no activity under any of the experimental conditions tested which include variation of the parameters that influence solubilization of the inclusion bodies and reconstitution of the protein into liposomes . the substrate specificity of reconstituted _PROTEIN_ was further investigated by measuring the rate of sam uptake into proteoliposomes that had been preloaded with various potential substrates . the highest activity was observed in the presence of internal sam . sam was also efficiently taken up by proteoliposomes containing sahc and s adenosylcysteine . negligible or zero activity was found in the absence of internal substrate or in the presence of internal met cys adenosine camp damp orn citrate and malate . alternative internal compounds deoxyadenosine phosphate pyruvate oxoglutarate glu gln thiamine thiamine pyrophosphate adp and nad were also incapable of supporting sam uptake . therefore reconstituted _PROTEIN_ displays a very narrow substrate specificity confined to sam and its closest analogs . the sam/sam exchange reaction catalyzed by reconstituted _PROTEIN_ was inhibited strongly by tannic acid bromocresol purple and the sulfydryl reagents mercuric chloride mersalyl and p hydroxymercuribenzoate . it was also inhibited to a lesser extent by mm n ethylmaleimide mm bathophenanthroline and mm pyridoxal p. the latter two inhibitors displayed a synergistic effect causing complete inhibition of transport activity when added together at higher concentrations . _PROTEIN_ and bongkrekic acid which are specific and powerful inhibitors of the mitochondrial adp/atp carrier exhibited different behavior _PROTEIN_ inhibited the activity of _PROTEIN_ partially whereas bongkrekic acid had little effect at a concentration that completely inhibits the adp/atp carrier . no inhibition was observed with the pyruvate carrier specific inhibitor cyano hydroxycinnamate whereas sam uptake was inhibited strongly by external addition of sahc s adenosylcysteine and adenosylornithine . in contrast no significant inhibition was observed with external met cys adenosine amp _PROTEIN_ orn malate or pyruvate phosphate oxoglutarate and asp when used at a concentration times that of the labeled substrate . the uptake of sam into proteoliposomes by exchange followed first order kinetics isotopic equilibrium being approached exponentially . the rate constant and the initial rate of sam exchange deduced from the time course were and mmol protein respectively . in contrast the uniport uptake of sam was very low in proteoliposomes preloaded with nacl in the absence of internal substrate . the uniport mode of transport was further investigated by measuring the efflux of sam from prelabeled active proteoliposomes because this provides a more convenient assay for unidirectional transport . in these experiments little yet significant efflux of sam from prelabeled proteoliposomes was observed in the absence of external substrate . the addition of mm sam induced a greater efflux of sam and the efflux either with or without added substrate was prevented by inhibitors of sam transport . therefore _PROTEIN_ is able to catalyze both uniport and exchange reactions . the kinetic constants of the recombinant _PROTEIN_ were determined by measuring the initial transport rate at various external sam concentrations in the presence of a constant saturating internal concentration of mm sam . the transport affinity and specific activity values for sam/sam exchange at were and mmol protein respectively in experiments . externally added sahc s adenosylcysteine and adenosylornithine were competitive inhibitors of sam uptake because they increased the apparent km without changing the vmax . the inhibition constants of sahc s adenosylcysteine and adenosylornithine were mm and mm respectively in at least three experiments for each inhibitor . some members of the mitochondrial carrier family are localized in nonmitochondrial _LOCATION_ . using different computer prediction _METHOD_ the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ was not unequivocal . for example the chlorop program predicted _LOCATION_ localization with high probability whereas the ipsort program predicted mitochondrial localization also with high probability . furthermore the scores for the chloroplastic and mitochondrial localization obtained by the targetp and predotar _METHOD_ were similar to those found for other proteins that are targeted to both organelles in arabidopsis . we therefore investigated the intracellular localization of ectopically _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ using a _METHOD_ tagged protein . cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed a punctate pattern of green _METHOD_ typical of the mitochondrial network that overlapped with the _METHOD_ displayed by the mitochondrial specific dye mitotracker red . this situation was similar to that obtained with _METHOD_ fused with the functionally characterized mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase . in contrast the green _METHOD_ of either _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or mmdh _METHOD_ did not colocalize with the red _METHOD_ of chlorophyll . these data show that _PROTEIN_ is efficiently targeted to mitochondria even though it does not exhibit a canonical presequence they do not however refute earlier evidence suggesting that the transporter is also present in the chloroplast envelope .

quantification of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in various organs was performed according to the comparative method _METHOD_ with the stem for _PROTEIN_ as calibrator . where sample is ct sample ct reference gene and ct is the threshold cycle _METHOD_ . for promoter gus fusion experiments the promoter regions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were amplified by pcr from arabidopsis col genomic dna using the following primers forward caccgggagataattgaaagc and reverse _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ and forward cacctgagagaaaaagaaagaagaaaaagaagaga and reverse _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ . the pcr products were first cloned into the shuttle vector pentr/d topo and then transferred into the binary gateway vector in frame with the gus gene . the resulting constructs were introduced into arabidopsis col plants by agrobacterium mediated transformation according to the floral dip method . to select transgenic plants seeds were germinated on murashige and skoog plates containing suc and supplemented with kanamycin in a growth chamber under a h h dark regime before transfer to soil in a climate controlled chamber under the same photoperiod . samples for gus activity analysis were harvested or d after germination and stained overnight according to standard protocols . pcr primers for _PROTEIN_ and for _PROTEIN_ carrying bamhi and hindiii and hindiii and ecori sites respectively were used to amplify the predicted open reading frames from an arabidopsis cdna library . the resulting products were cloned into the prun vector for _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli . for subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ and mmdh the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the mmdh _METHOD_ fusion constructs were prepared . the coding sequences of _PROTEIN_ and of mmdh without the terminal codon were amplified by pcr using the following primers forward caccatggctcctcttactctctcgt and reverse ttcttctttggtttctttaaccgtatt for _PROTEIN_ and forward caccatgaggacctccatgttg and reverse _PROTEIN_ for tomato mmdh . the resulting products were cloned into the entry vector pentr/d topo using the gateway recombination system . subsequently the _PROTEIN_ or the mmdh coding sequence was recombined into the destination vector

from arabidopsis col plants grown as described above in the absence of kanamycin . the vector containing the coding sequence of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or mmdh _METHOD_ was introduced into arabidopsis protoplasts by the polyethylene glycol mediated transformation method . after to h of incubation in the dark at protoplasts were imaged using a laser scanning confocal microscope _PROTEIN_ . in some experiments the transformed protoplasts were incubated in the presence of nm mitotracker red cmxros at for min and then extensively washed before imaging following the protocol of citation . the overproduction of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as inclusion bodies in the _LOCATION_ of e. coli was accomplished as described . control cultures with empty vector were processed in parallel . inclusion
