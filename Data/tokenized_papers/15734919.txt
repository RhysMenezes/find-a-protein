analysis of ribosomes of arabidopsis by use of high speed centrifugation sucrose gradient fractionation one and two dimensional gel electrophoresis liquid chromatography purification and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ identified ribosomal proteins of which are orthologs of rat r proteins and one is the plant specific r protein . thirty small subunit and large subunit r proteins were confirmed . in addition an ortholog of the mammalian receptor for activated protein kinase c a tryptophan aspartic acid domain repeat protein was found to be associated with the subunit and polysomes . based on the prediction that each r protein is present in a single copy the _METHOD_ of the arabidopsis ribosome was estimated as md with the single copy rrnas contributing of the _METHOD_ . despite strong evolutionary conservation in r protein composition among eukaryotes arabidopsis ribosomes are variable in composition due to distinctions in _METHOD_ or charge of approximately of the r proteins . this is a consequence of amino acid sequence divergence within r protein gene families and posttranslational modification of individual r proteins . for example distinct types of r proteins and accumulate in ribosomes due to evolutionarily divergence of r protein genes . ribosome variation is also due to amino acid sequence divergence and differential phosphorylation of the _PROTEIN_ terminus of r protein . the role of ribosome heterogeneity in differential mrna translation is discussed .
in a previous study we identified genes that encode putative types of _LOCATION_ r proteins in arabidopsis . to confirm the presence of these proteins in arabidopsis ribosomes a ribosome pellet fraction was isolated from dark grown suspension culture cells by detergent extraction and differential centrifugation . the majority of r proteins are basic and a few are highly acidic . the basic proteins were optimally separated in a first dimension basic urea gel that achieved separation of proteins ranging in pi from to . proteins were further fractionated by apparent molecular _METHOD_ in the second dimension by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and stained with _METHOD_ blue . the acidic and neutral proteins of the ribosome pellet fraction were optimally separated by nonequilibrium ph gel electrophoresis in the first dimension and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the second dimension . the protein spots were excised and digested in gel with trypsin and analyzed by either peptide _METHOD_ fingerprinting using maldi tof or tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ using triple quadropole tof with orthogonal maldi or electro spray ionization as the ion source . the proteomic analyses of the ribosome pellet fraction resulted in the identification of of the types of putative _LOCATION_ r proteins . these included r proteins identified with the basic urea gel system with the nephge system and with both _METHOD_ . none of the spots contained known proteins of _LOCATION_ or mitochondrial ribosomes indicating that organellar ribosomes were not abundant in the pellet fraction . the percentage of the total residues of each protein detected in peptide fragments by maldi tof ranged from to with more than one half of the proteins identified with over sequence coverage . _METHOD_ was used for peptide sequencing to confirm the identity of proteins with low sequence coverage . peptides corresponding to the products of or more distinct genes were detected for of the r proteins consistent with the finding that most r proteins are encoded by to _PROTEIN_ genes . identification of arabidopsis r proteins by _METHOD_ analysis arabidopsis r protein identification follows the universally accepted nomenclature as outlined in citation . r proteins resolved in gel spots are designated and . evolutionarily distinct r proteins are designated and . gel system abbreviations _PROTEIN_ polyacrylamide b basic urea n nonequilibrium ph . protein identification method abbreviations m maldi tof _METHOD_ qt omaldi or electro spray ionization q tof _METHOD_ _METHOD_ ribosomal and nonribosomal protein complexes were separated by suc density centrifugation and polysomal proteins separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were digested with trypsin and analyzed all r proteins were identified in the suc gradient purified polysome fraction by _METHOD_ except and . biochemical variation in r proteins was apparent from the detection of r proteins identified in more than one gel spot . of these peptides specific to a gene family member were identified in spots corresponding to and indicating that the difference in mobility can reflect biochemical distinctions of individual gene products . for other r proteins found in two or more spots the same gene product was identified in multiple spots suggesting that the variation in apparent charge or _METHOD_ could be due to covalent posttranslational modifications . for example the product of _PROTEIN_ was resolved in _METHOD_ with the same migration in the basic urea gel but with different apparent molecular _METHOD_ whereas _METHOD_ of and had slightly different pis . distinctions in protein migration did not appear to be due to n terminal acetylation which was confirmed for nine r proteins . unequal stoichiometry of some r proteins was suggested from the _METHOD_ blue staining however variation in the staining intensity of both basic and acidic proteins could be due to differences in avidity of proteins to the stain . the ribosome pellet isolated by differential centrifugation reproducibly included several acidic and neutral proteins that are not r proteins . these proteins included core proteasome subunits several abundant _LOCATION_ proteins a mitochondrial chaperonin an abundant _LOCATION_ enzyme and a wd repeat domain protein . to evaluate if these proteins were present in the ribosome pellet fraction due to an association with translational complexes or cosedimentation of macromolecular complexes the pellet was subjected to suc density gradient fractionation the proteins in the resulting fractions were separated by one dimensional _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and visualized by _METHOD_ blue staining . immunoblot analysis with anti maize and anti yeast antisera specific for small and large ribosomal subunits respectively was performed to identify fractions enriched in and subunits ribosomes and polysomes . the stained gel was divided into seven sections for the polysomal fraction which were subjected to in gel trypsin digestion followed by liquid chromatography coupled to q tof _METHOD_ . in this manner the polysome fraction was found to include of the r proteins detected after gel separation as well as additional putative r proteins bringing the total number of identified r proteins to . of the non r proteins detected on gels the abundant tonoplast _LOCATION_ associated reversibly glycosylated polypeptide was present in the nonpolysomal fraction and absent in the polysomal fraction whereas proteasome subunits a b and e were identified in both fractions . a kd protein resolved as spot number by nephge/sds _PROTEIN_ was identified as a wd repeat domain protein related to mammalian receptor for activated protein kinase c _PROTEIN_ . three arabidopsis genes encode a protein with amino acid sequence identity to human _PROTEIN_ . peptides corresponding to the product of of these genes were detected in spot number and in a kd band observed in the subunit ribosome and polysome fractions . consistent with the conclusion that the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ ortholog associates with ribosomes via an interaction with the subunit this protein was detected in the and polysome fractions at levels similar to that observed for r protein . the detection of r protein in multiple protein spots led to the evaluation of the phosphorylation of gene products _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . and are identical in amino acid sequence but have divergent _PROTEIN_ termini with and potential phosphorylation sites respectively . eight _METHOD_ of were identified among the constellation of proteins with an apparent pi of to and molecular _METHOD_ of to kd . the _METHOD_ and to d displayed more rapid mobility in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ dimension than the _METHOD_ to g. _METHOD_ analysis of each of the _METHOD_ by in gel trypsin digestion and barium hydroxide treatment provided evidence of _PROTEIN_ terminal phosphorylation in and . phosphorylation of ser or thr _PROTEIN_ the charge of tryptic peptides and reduces the frequency of peptide ionization during maldi tof _METHOD_ analysis . to circumvent this difficulty trypsin digestion was coupled with treatment with barium hydroxide which causes elimination of . thus the ions of phosphorylated peptides show an _METHOD_ to charge ratio reduction for each phosphorylated residue . when this procedure was carried out with the extremely basic form only an unmodified _PROTEIN_ terminal peptide was detected . on the other hand the m/z values of ions from the to d digests corresponded to the predicted _METHOD_ of mono di tri and tetra phosphorylated respectively . peptide ions from to c were detected that also corresponded to the predicted _METHOD_ of mono di and tri phosphorylated respectively . by comparison of theoretical and observed _METHOD_ values we determined that was phosphorylated at ser to d were phosphorylated at ser and additional sites in the region . the rapid migrating to g _METHOD_ were sequentially di tri and tetra phosphorylated _METHOD_ of . interestingly the detection of the ion corresponding to nonphosphorylated form of the peptide indicated that ser was _PROTEIN_ by the kinase or dephosphorylated by an unknown phosphatase in the formation of to g. although the absence of cleavage sites in the _PROTEIN_ terminus precluded identification of the exact sites of phosphorylation in some _METHOD_ these results confirm extensive heterogeneity in the _PROTEIN_ terminal phosphorylation sites of and . identification of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ terminal phosphorylation sites by madli tof _METHOD_ analysis id method abbreviations m maldi tof asterisk indicates phosphorylated residue single underscore indicates candidate phosphorylation sites within peptide . the percent amino acid sequence identity between the deduced arabidopsis and rat r protein orthologs was extremely consistent among gene family members except for the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ multigene families . evolutionary divergence among these gene families was confirmed by use of sequence alignment pairwise distance calculations as well as distance and parsimony based phylogenetic analyses . of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ encode a protein with to identity and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ encode a protein with and identity to rat respectively . eukaryotic is orthologous to of eubacteria _LOCATION_ and mitochondria of lower eukaryotes which binds rrna and is crucial for ribosome assembly . conservation between plant and animal includes the _PROTEIN_ terminal amino acid region that corresponds to an rrna binding site in eubacteria . in addition a number of residues within this region are highly conserved in eubacterial _LOCATION_ and archaebacterial . the calculation of pairwise uncorrected distances between arabidopsis and proteins confirmed that falls into distinct groups and . this analysis revealed that evolutionary distance between arabidopsis proteins within each of the two groups was substantially less than between groups . the distance between type i or type ii to _LOCATION_ was quite similar whereas the distance between escherichia coli and _LOCATION_ was less than between any arabidopsis or rat confirming that the _PROTEIN_ duplication postdates the divergence between prokaryotes and eukaryotes . maximum parsimony and neighbor joining evaluation of eukaryotic and eubacterial _LOCATION_ and archaebacterial amino acid sequences resolved highly supported clades for eukaryotic . two clades corresponded to plants and one corresponded to other eukaryotes . the plant type i grouped with of rat drosophila and yeast whereas plant type ii formed a strongly supported separate clade . the analysis supports the conclusion that the duplication event that led to the divergence of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ genes occurred prior to the divergence of monocots and eudicots . divergence between and r proteins of various species uncorrected distances given in top _PROTEIN_ total residue differences in bottom _PROTEIN_ . the _METHOD_ analysis demonstrated that both types of were present in the arabidopsis ribosome pellet fraction strongly supporting the conclusion that the products of both evolutionarily distinct _PROTEIN_ gene groups encode r proteins . type ii was more acidic and was present at lower abundance than type i as judged by the intensity of staining with _METHOD_ blue . evolutionary divergence was also evident within the r protein gene family . we showed previously that maize ribosomes possess a complex of approximately kd acidic proteins composed of and a related protein designated . the deduced arabidopsis proteins display an unusual range in sequence identity to rat . figure illustrates the considerable amino acid sequence divergence between the arabidopsis proteins . the divergence in the terminal residues of and is especially notable since this region is nearly universally conserved among eukaryotic and . use of methods to evaluate evolutionary relatedness confirmed the presence of distinct protein groups and . not unexpectedly the analysis resolved the clades of eukaryotic kd p proteins corresponding to and plant specific . the plant proteins separated into distinct clusters corresponding to proteins of monocotyledonous plants and strongly supported clusters of arabidopsis proteins . the groupings of rice and maize and suggest the duplication event that led to _METHOD_ of occurred prior to the divergence of rice and maize but after the divergence of monocots and eudicots . the _METHOD_ analysis of the acidic proteins confirmed the presence of both evolutionary groups of in the ribosome pellet . the evolutionarily divergent type ii appeared to be present in substoichiometric amounts based on the intensity of staining with _METHOD_ blue . divergence between r proteins of various species uncorrected distances given in top _PROTEIN_ total residue differences in bottom _PROTEIN_ . the arabidopsis genome encodes type proteins with approximately identity and one type protein with identity to rat . r protein is the ortholog of eubacterial and archaebacterial . distance calculations and phylogenetic analyses confirmed that polypeptide sequences of plants fall into evolutionarily distinct categories due to a divergence within the plant lineage that predates the monocot and eudicot divergence . the _METHOD_ analysis confirmed the presence of the type encoded by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the ribosome pellet fraction however the product of _PROTEIN_ was not detected in ribosomes even though the gene transcript accumulated in the cultured cells . the predicted _METHOD_ of the arabidopsis subunit is kd based on the presence of the rrna a single copy of the small subunit r proteins and the _PROTEIN_ like protein . similarly the predicted _METHOD_ of the arabidopsis subunit is kd based on the presence of rrnas and a single copy of the large subunit proteins including of each of the kd p proteins . thus the arabidopsis ribosome is approximately md with of the _METHOD_ contributed by rrna . the ribosome _METHOD_ could vary slightly due to covalent posttranslational modifications of r proteins the presence of the small r proteins not detected by _METHOD_ and/or the absence or presence of dispensable r proteins such as sa and individual p proteins .
