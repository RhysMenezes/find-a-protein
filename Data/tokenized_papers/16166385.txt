the transition from the juvenile to the mature phase during vegetative development in plants is characterized by changes in leaf shape . we show that general transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ regulates differences in leaf patterning between juvenile and mature leaves in arabidopsis . _PROTEIN_ encodes a novel small bromodomain containing protein unique to plants . mutations in _PROTEIN_ disrupt the formation of elliptical leaf laminae in mature leaves whereas overexpression of _PROTEIN_ resulted in elongated juvenile leaves . _PROTEIN_ positively regulates the _PROTEIN_ of asymmetric _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which encodes a myb domain protein that controls proximodistal patterning of leaves . using chromatin immunoprecipitation _PROTEIN_ assays we show that _PROTEIN_ is associated with the promoter and the start of the transcribed region of _PROTEIN_ and up regulates _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ through acetylation of histones and . genetic studies demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ is epistatic to _PROTEIN_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ regulates _PROTEIN_ during leaf morphogenesis . chromatin remodeling at _PROTEIN_ is a key regulatory mechanism in leaf development which ensures the continual production of mature leaves following juvenile adult transition thereby _PROTEIN_ the identity of the mature vegetative phase .
_PROTEIN_ has eight exons and encodes a protein of amino acid residues with the bromodomain motif spanning residues . to identify the transcription start site of _PROTEIN_ the end of the _PROTEIN_ transcript was examined by rapid amplification of cdna ends _PROTEIN_ followed by pcr . the transcription start site was mapped to bp upstream of the translation start site . in wild type arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ transcripts are most abundant in flowers low in roots leaves and siliques and undetectable in d old seedlings . in the basal rosette leaves of d old wild type plants _PROTEIN_ transcripts are more abundant in leaves and which possess narrow elliptical laminae than in leaves which have round laminae suggesting a possible correlation between _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the formation of elliptical leaf laminae in mature leaves . differences in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ between the juvenile and mature leaves in d old plants are not likely to be due to differences in leaf age because _PROTEIN_ transcript levels are similar in leaves and at d after leaf initiation suggesting that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ does not change during various times of leaf elongation and maturation . to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ may control the development of leaf shape we analyzed mutants from the salk collection that contained transferred dna insertions in the promoter region of the _PROTEIN_ gene . the effect of the mutations is most obvious in leaves and which have round laminae rather than the elliptical laminae of leaves and of the wild type plants . the t dna insertions resulted in fewer _PROTEIN_ transcripts in leaf suggesting misregulation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the transcript abundance of _PROTEIN_ in leaf of the insertion mutants was similar to leaf of the wild type and the insertion mutant plants suggesting that the t dna insertions have disrupted the activation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the mature leaves . thus elevated _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in leaves and of wild type plants is important for the development of the elliptical leaf lamina . phase transition during vegetative development is also characterized by changes in trichome distribution . in arabidopsis juvenile leaves have trichomes present only on the adaxial surface whereas mature leaves possess trichomes on both adaxial and abaxial surfaces . trichome distribution on the rosette leaves of the insertion mutants was similar to that of the wild type plants indicating that _PROTEIN_ does not regulate phase transition per se but is involved in controlling development of mature leaf shapes . to investigate further the regulation of leaf development by _PROTEIN_ we transformed wild type plants with a _PROTEIN_ construct containing the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter fused to the _PROTEIN_ cdna resulting in more _PROTEIN_ transcripts . elevated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ resulted in juvenile leaves showing an elongated and elliptical shape . we also analyzed mutants possessing _PROTEIN_ amounts of _PROTEIN_ transcripts generated using a construct containing the camv promoter linked to two copies of a bp region of the _PROTEIN_ cdna in inverted orientations . database analysis of this bp sequence did not identify any other arabidopsis genes containing similar nucleotide sequences of bp or more suggesting that the construct was specific for _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transcript levels in the plants resulted in shorter and broader leaf laminae in mature leaves as compared with the corresponding leaves in the wild type plants . control plants transformed with empty vectors were morphologically similar to wild type plants indicating that the phenotype of the leaves of plants containing the _PROTEIN_ and constructs was not the result of transformation procedures . altered amounts of _PROTEIN_ transcripts in the _PROTEIN_ and plants did not alter the rate of leaf production the flowering time or the total number of leaves in the basal rosette suggesting that the vegetative phase was not affected . these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ is involved in the development of the leaf lamina in mature leaves . no change in flower morphology silique structure or root length was observed in the mutants . the proximodistal axis of the leaf is established in part by _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . loss of function mutations in _PROTEIN_ led to shorter broader and occasionally lobed laminae whereas overexpression resulted in elongated and elliptical juvenile leaves . because the phenotypes of the _PROTEIN_ mutants are similar to the _PROTEIN_ mutants and _PROTEIN_ is likely to regulate leaf shape by regulating the _PROTEIN_ of genes involved in leaf development we investigated _PROTEIN_ transcript levels in the _PROTEIN_ mutants . elevated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ plants resulted in more _PROTEIN_ transcripts whereas _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the rnai plants resulted in fewer _PROTEIN_ transcripts . in wild type plants _PROTEIN_ transcripts in leaf were more abundant than in leaf consistent with the observation that _PROTEIN_ transcripts were more abundant in leaf than leaf . no difference in the amount of _PROTEIN_ transcripts was observed between leaves and of the t dna insertion mutants suggesting misregulation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the insertion mutants . we also examined the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ which genetically interacts with _PROTEIN_ to regulate leaf patterning in arabidopsis . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was not altered in the _PROTEIN_ overexpressing mutants or in _PROTEIN_ rnai plants . the _PROTEIN_ of other genes involved in leaf development such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ drl _PROTEIN_ and was also investigated . however no change in the transcript levels of these genes was observed in the _PROTEIN_ mutants suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is not regulating the _PROTEIN_ of these genes . although and _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion mutants have similar altered mature leaf phenotypes they are different in other aspects of leaf development e.g. _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion mutants have flat leaf laminae whereas has curly leaf blades . double mutants of and _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion mutant have curly leaves and are morphologically more similar to than _PROTEIN_ mutants suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is epistatic to _PROTEIN_ . when _PROTEIN_ was overexpressed in no change in leaf shape was observed in any of the overexpressing plants further suggesting that _PROTEIN_ regulates leaf development through _PROTEIN_ . wild type plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ have a phenotype similar to _PROTEIN_ plants i.e. elliptical leaves and implicating both genes in control of mature leaf shape . these results provide genetic evidence that _PROTEIN_ acts downstream of _PROTEIN_ . the location of the _PROTEIN_ protein in the cell was examined using arabidopsis plants stably transformed with a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct which _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion protein . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein is localized to the _LOCATION_ which is consistent with its predicted role as a transcription _PROTEIN_ . a _LOCATION_ targeting signal is predicted in the c terminal region of _PROTEIN_ . to investigate whether the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is directly regulated by _PROTEIN_ we examined the association of _PROTEIN_ with various regions of _PROTEIN_ with chromatin immunoprecipitation _PROTEIN_ experiments using arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein . linking _METHOD_ to the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ did not abolish the function of the protein as shown by the phenotypes of wild type plants transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which were similar to wild type plants transformed with _PROTEIN_ i.e. elongated and elliptical laminae in leaves . figure shows leaf of three independently transformed lines of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants . furthermore _PROTEIN_ transcripts were increased in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants as well as in the _PROTEIN_ plants indicating that both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ up regulated the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ transcripts remained unchanged in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants as in the _PROTEIN_ plants . _PROTEIN_ was performed using antibodies to _METHOD_ as described previously . coprecipitated dna was analyzed by pcr using primer pairs that amplify various regions of _PROTEIN_ . in three independently transformed lines of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants the _METHOD_ antibodies coprecipitated the promoter and the end of the intron and the end of exon of _PROTEIN_ . the _METHOD_ antibodies did not coprecipitate regions and of _PROTEIN_ these sequences were undetected even after forty rounds of pcr . _PROTEIN_ thus regulates _PROTEIN_ by associating with a kbp region containing the promoter and the start of the transcribed region of _PROTEIN_ which are likely to be important regulatory regions for transcriptional control . we next examined histone acetylation states at _PROTEIN_ to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ may regulate _PROTEIN_ through acetylation of histones . _PROTEIN_ was performed using leaves of wild type columbia and _PROTEIN_ plants . histones associated with the promoter and the transcribed region of _PROTEIN_ were more acetylated in leaves of the _PROTEIN_ plants compared with the wild type plants . histone acetylation was also increased at regions and of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ plants . histone acetylation at region of exon was unaltered . elevated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ plants thus resulted in increased histone and acetylation at the promoter and the start of the transcribed region of _PROTEIN_ regions where the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein binds . no change in histone and acetylation at the upstream region was observed . histone acetylation at _PROTEIN_ was examined in leaves and of a t dna insertion mutant to determine whether _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ resulted in _PROTEIN_ histone acetylation . leaves and were investigated because the shapes of these leaves were most different between the insertion mutant and the wild type plants . the promoter and the transcribed regions of _PROTEIN_ in leaves and of wild type plants were associated with high histone and acetylation compared with leaves of wild type again correlating increased histone acetylation with mature leaf shape . in leaves and of the insertion mutant histone acetylation at the promoter and transcribed region of _PROTEIN_ was lower than in the wild type plants . histone acetylation at regions and of _PROTEIN_ was also _PROTEIN_ in the insertion mutant . thus lower _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in leaves and of the t dna insertion mutant is associated with _PROTEIN_ acetylation of histones and at _PROTEIN_ as compared with wild type plants . no difference in histone acetylation at region of exon was observed between the insertion mutant and the wild type plants . following the complete sequencing of the arabidopsis genome _PROTEIN_ was annotated as a bet gene because it contains a bromodomain and an extraterminal domain and was classified as a member of the _PROTEIN_ family of transcription _PROTEIN_ . the function of the et domain is unknown but has been proposed to be involved in protein protein interactions . the bet class of proteins includes the yeast the drosophila fsh and the vertebrate _PROTEIN_ and . however _PROTEIN_ was not among the putative bet proteins proposed for arabidopsis . the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ contains only of the residues conserved in the et domain and lacks the serine rich motif known as the _PROTEIN_ motif that is characteristic of bet proteins . the sequences flanking the bromodomain of _PROTEIN_ also do not possess similarity to animal and yeast bet proteins . furthermore animal and yeast bet proteins contain bromodomains whereas _PROTEIN_ contains a single bromodomain . thus _PROTEIN_ is not likely to be a plant homolog of the animal bet proteins . database searches indicate that genes that possess high sequence similarities with _PROTEIN_ are present in pea maize and rice but not in unicellular _METHOD_ and animals suggesting that this class of genes is unique to plants .
