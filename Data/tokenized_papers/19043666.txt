indole butyric acid and dichlorophenoxybutyric acid are metabolised by peroxisomal oxidation to active auxins that inhibit root growth . we screened arabidopsis mutants for resistance to iba and db and identified two new db resistant mutants . the mutant genes encode a putative oxidoreductase _PROTEIN_ and a putative acyl activating enzyme _PROTEIN_ . both proteins are localised to _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ is coexpressed with core oxidation genes but germination seedling growth and the fatty acid profile of _PROTEIN_ seedlings are indistinguishable from wild type . the _PROTEIN_ mutant is also resistant to iba but _PROTEIN_ is not . _PROTEIN_ is the first example of a gene required for response to db but not iba . the closest relative of _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is predicted to be peroxisomal but an _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant responded similarly to _PROTEIN_ for all assays . we propose that _PROTEIN_ is capable of activating db but iba activating enzymes remain to be discovered . we present an updated model for peroxisomal pro auxin metabolism in arabidopsis that includes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ .
we selected genes encoding predicted peroxisomal proteins with similarity to known oxidation proteins for reverse genetic analysis . these included uncharacterised acyl activating enzymes hydratases dehydrogenases/oxidoreductases and thiolases . homozygous mutants were isolated from one _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and t dna lines representing genes . of the t dna lines rt pcr confirmed lines from genes to be lacking full length transcripts . the transcript knockout lines so obtained are listed in table by their allelic designations . _PROTEIN_ is a new col _METHOD_ mutant for this gene originally identified in a screen for new sucrose dependent mutants . we backcrossed _PROTEIN_ twice and sequencing revealed the lesion to be a change that presumably affects protein topology near the catalytic _PROTEIN_ residue . _PROTEIN_ is in ws background . we screened mutants listed in table for resistance to pro auxins db and iba . screening of homozygous lines on db yielded two new db resistant mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . . _PROTEIN_ is a short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family protein and _PROTEIN_ an acyl activating enzyme family protein . when screened on iba the two _PROTEIN_ alleles were resistant to iba but all three _PROTEIN_ alleles were sensitive . no further new iba resistant mutants were revealed amongst the lines listed in table . we also characterized _PROTEIN_ a new mutant allele of _PROTEIN_ . it is similar to other characterised strong alleles of _PROTEIN_ which are highly resistant to pro auxins . similarly we obtained _PROTEIN_ as a characterised partially resistant control . both of the _PROTEIN_ alleles and two of the _PROTEIN_ alleles were subsequently characterised in detail for auxin response and other characteristics . the new db resistant lines were characterised for dose responses to db . on increasing concentrations of db _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ appeared to be as resistant for root elongation as _PROTEIN_ up to db but were less resistant above this concentration . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were more resistant to db than _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ mutant is in ler background and shows similar trends but both the ler wild type and _PROTEIN_ are apparently more sensitive to db than col and _PROTEIN_ and are thus presented separately . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ appear to be as resistant as _PROTEIN_ to db . the _PROTEIN_ alleles were more resistant to higher than lower concentrations of iba and db . this was previously noted by lange et al . for _PROTEIN_ grown on db but there is no obvious explanation for this phenomenon . neither of the _PROTEIN_ alleles germinated on db . lethality of _PROTEIN_ at high concentrations of db was not previously reported . when grown on iba _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ all displayed resistance consistent with that reported in previous studies . compared to growth on media lacking hormone root elongation of all lines was markedly inhibited by iba . this response is at variance with previous reports for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ where root growth inhibition was less severe in response to iba . similarly the greater inhibition of root elongation at compared to iba for the stronger mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was not reported earlier . these two discrepancies are most likely due to different media and growth conditions of the studies . in accordance with zolman et al . _PROTEIN_ was less severe in its response to iba than _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ mutants were at least as resistant as _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ mutant appeared to be almost as resistant to iba as _PROTEIN_ at all concentrations tested and was more resistant than _PROTEIN_ to iba . _PROTEIN_ displayed a similar trend of high resistance with its difference to _PROTEIN_ most likely attributable to the ecotype differences of the alleles . interestingly all three _PROTEIN_ alleles behaved like wild type in their iba response _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respond normally to the active auxins iaa d and naa indicating there is no general block to auxin signaling . when grown on nm iaa nm d or nm naa all genotypes showed inhibition of root length comparable to their respective wild types . ws had a low level of natural resistance to d and db compared to col and ler . the resistance of ws to low concentration of db has been previously reported . interestingly though both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ appeared to be somewhat resistant to d . to further characterise their auxin response all db resistant mutants were assessed for their capacity to produce _PROTEIN_ roots . seeds were germinated and grown for days on medium containing sucrose then plants were transferred to medium containing hormones for days . with the exception of _PROTEIN_ all mutants produced numbers of _PROTEIN_ roots comparable to their wild types when grown on media without added hormone . both _PROTEIN_ mutants produced less _PROTEIN_ roots under these conditions than their wild types . this was also the case for _PROTEIN_ grown for differing durations on sucrose up to days in total . iba stimulated _PROTEIN_ root formation considerably in wild type controls as well as in _PROTEIN_ . in contrast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ all produced fewer _PROTEIN_ roots on iba than their respective wild types . marked increases in the number of _PROTEIN_ roots were observed in all cases when the seedlings were transferred to media supplemented with nm naa indicating no general block to _PROTEIN_ rooting capacity . _METHOD_ fusions with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were constructed by inserting _METHOD_ in frame into the coding sequence close to the c terminus . by this method _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ both localised to _LOCATION_ when compared to a peroxisomal _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ marker . _PROTEIN_ possesses a c terminal _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ a c terminal _PROTEIN_ . these are both canonical plant _PROTEIN_ signal peptides consistent with the observation of peroxisomal _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ has moreover been identified in the proteome of leaf _LOCATION_ . to examine whether any of the lines were also affected in triacylglycerol metabolism we grew seedlings in the dark on media with or without added sucrose . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ alleles were able to etiolate normally in the absence of sucrose indicating that tag metabolism was not affected sufficiently to disrupt seedling germination and growth . as expected neither of the _PROTEIN_ alleles emerged from seed coats during this experiment and _PROTEIN_ grew poorly without sucrose as reported previously for _PROTEIN_ mutants . seedling establishment and early development of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ alleles in the light without exogenously supplied sucrose appeared normal . although it is _PROTEIN_ during early seedling establishment further information about _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene is lacking because it is not represented on the affymetrix genechip _PROTEIN_ . however much information about _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is available . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was examined using publicly available microarray data . using genevestigator _PROTEIN_ is highly _PROTEIN_ throughout the plant life cycle but is more highly _PROTEIN_ in germinated seed . during development similar _PROTEIN_ patterns are observed in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in line with the apparent co regulation with oxidation genes _PROTEIN_ also clusters with _PROTEIN_ and oxidation genes when analysed using _PROTEIN_ . many oxidation genes are in the top genes coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ including _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . analysis of transcript abundance during the diurnal cycle also indicates that in mature leaf tissue _PROTEIN_ is co regulated with oxidation genes . despite the apparent link between _PROTEIN_ and oxidation genes no evidence was obtained to show that mobilisation of tag for seedling growth was impaired in _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . nevertheless the possibility that oxidation of specific fatty acids could be impaired was investigated . total fatty acids were isolated for gc _METHOD_ analysis from two day old seedlings a stage when tag breakdown is taking place most rapidly . the amounts of numerous medium and long chain fatty acids were about the same in col and _PROTEIN_ including the major tag fatty acids linoleic acid and eicosenoic acid _PROTEIN_ . in contrast _PROTEIN_ contained elevated levels of these fatty acids due to impaired tag breakdown . these features indicate that fatty acid metabolism in _PROTEIN_ is indistinguishable from wild type consistent with the hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ participates preferentially in auxin synthesis . _PROTEIN_ is a member of a large family of acyl activating enzymes and redundancy of peroxisomal isoform functions has already been demonstrated in the family with the closely related _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ involved in activating tag derived fatty acids but not auxins . for this reason we generated a double mutant of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to examine auxin responses . _PROTEIN_ also has a _PROTEIN_ . it is the closest relative of _PROTEIN_ in the arabidopsis genome and a good candidate for double mutant analysis . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant was no more resistant to db than _PROTEIN_ normally sensitive to iba and mature auxins produced normal numbers of _PROTEIN_ roots when stimulated by iba and naa and was not dependent on sucrose for etiolation .
salk _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ gabi kat and cshl t dna lines were obtained from stock centres and screened to homozygosity . when available multiple alleles per gene were ordered . primer design utilised the t dna _PROTEIN_ primer design server . rt pcr primers were designed to bound the insertion sites and used to screen each line for the absence of full length transcript as an indicator that they were transcript knockouts . for seed germination and growth assays half strength _METHOD_ media was buffered with mes solidified with agar and supplemented with sucrose and hormones as indicated . seed were imbibed on plates at for h prior to assays . all in vitro assays were conducted at under continuous white light . all knockout lines were initially screened for root elongation on db . they were also screened for defects in etiolation in the absence of sucrose . knockout lines that displayed resistance to db were further characterised by dose responses to db and iba . they were grown for days on media supplemented with sucrose and or db or with or iba . in addition response to active auxins was assayed using media containing nm naa nm d or nm iaa . iaa and iba containing plates as well as controls for those experiments were incubated under yellow filters to reduce the photochemical degradation of indole containing compounds . _PROTEIN_ root assays were conducted by growing seedlings for days on media containing _METHOD_ and sucrose . seedlings were then transferred to similar media supplemented either with no hormone iba or nm naa and the number of _PROTEIN_ roots was counted and days after transfer . etiolation was assessed by sowing seeds to _METHOD_ media containing either or sucrose exposing them to light for h then transferring to the dark . hypocotyl lengths were measured after days dark growth . digital photographs were taken of assay plates and image j _PROTEIN_ was used to measure root and hypocotyl lengths . all root and hypocotyl measurement experiments were conducted at least twice and means were calculated on least seedlings . single experiments are depicted in the results . _METHOD_ fusions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were constructed according to a modification of the _METHOD_ tagging of full length proteins _PROTEIN_ method of tian et al . . _PROTEIN_ introduces _METHOD_ into genomic clones in a position corresponding to approximately amino acids from the c terminus and enables analysis of spatial and temporal localisation of proteins during plant development . the position close to the c terminus largely avoids structural and functional protein domains and preserves both n and c terminal targeting sequences and _LOCATION_ anchoring signals in full length proteins . we _PROTEIN_ the method for use in transient _PROTEIN_ assays . thus _METHOD_ was inserted within a stretch of hydrophilic residues close to the c terminus but this was done using coding sequence alone and driven by promoter . enhanced _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was amplified including _PROTEIN_ as described by tian et al . . the n terminal portions of sdr and _PROTEIN_ were amplified from total cdna using appropriate mer primers . oligos and corresponding to the c terminal amino acids _PROTEIN_ and amino acids _PROTEIN_ plus the stop codon of the protein were synthesised to comprise a template for direct inclusion in a second round of pcr . primers and included _PROTEIN_ to enable amplification by universal primers . primers and had _PROTEIN_ that overlapped with those bounding the _METHOD_ fragment . three template pcr thus included three overlapping templates _METHOD_ and used universal primers with attb cloning sequences . universal primers and _PROTEIN_ are as described in tian et al . . tt pcr products were cloned into gateway vector and sequenced to check pcr accuracy . the _METHOD_ constructs were then introduced into a pgreen vector modified for gateway . we used containing camv promoter and camv terminator with the gateway a cassette inserted between them in the smai site of the pgreen multiple cloning site . for colocalisation studies _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was used as a peroxisomal marker . plasmids were precipitated onto gold particles and biolistically transformed into onion epidermal peel as described in thirkettle watts et al . . _METHOD_ images were obtained using olympus _METHOD_ microscope with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ filters _METHOD_ and manipulated with cellr software . plant tissue was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen ground into a fine powder and extracted with isopropyl alcohol _PROTEIN_ as an antioxidant at for min . fifty _METHOD_ of fatty acid was added as an internal standard to each sample before the extraction . after cooling down to room temperature of n hexane was added to the tube and the mixture sonicated for min . the isopropyl alcohol hexane mixture was separated from the cell debris and was dried under vacuum . the fatty acids in the extract were converted to their methyl esters by heating at for h in of methanol with . after cooling to room temperature and mixing with of nacl fatty acid methyl esters were extracted with of n hexane for _METHOD_ analysis . gc _METHOD_ analysis utilised an agilent coupled with _METHOD_ selective detector . the temperature program was initial temperature min at temperature was then ramped to at then ramped to at and held at for min . the gc capillary column used for analysis was varian _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . fatty acid peak areas were normalized to that of the internal standard and the weight of starting tissue to yield mg/g fresh weight for each fatty acid .
